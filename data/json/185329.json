This was our first time there and will most defiantly return. The location of this resort is perfect. Neither one of us have any complaints, about anything! Seriously...it was just that good! The buffet has something for everyone, and if you can't find anything there, go to one of the fine restaurants that the hotel provides. If you are still not satisfied, you can either order room service, or tour around 5th Avenue. The beach is really great. We met Alex at the swing bar, and had a great afternoon with him and the many other visitors. Alex truly put a smile on our faces no matter where he was stationed to work. Always attentive, and always smiling! Great job Alex. At the pool bar, a special thanks to Montero (aka Mark Anthony) who taught us some Spanish, and learnt some English lol. When we went to the beach to get some sun, we met one of the hardest workers on the resort...Pablo. Walking on the sand, all day, in the heat, catering to our every needs, this guy truly goes above and beyond the call of duty. Sometimes carrying two trays of drinks...great job to all of you. Our room was 128, which was very quick access to everything. Only steps away from the 24 hour bar/food area, ice machine (very important), towel exchange, beach, massage hut, pool area, lobby bar, elevator...and yet, surprisingly very quiet at night. The bed and bedding was to die for, and with the ocean view room we also had a mini bar with rum, vodka, tequila, and scotch whiskey, and a small fridge with water, Pepsi, orange pop, 7-up and beer. Upon request, they brought us more of whatever we asked for. Our guy that stocked our room even found us a liter of tomato juice (so sorry we forgot his name). Claudia also did a fine job of cleaning our room and leaving beautiful towel art every day. It is important to hang the sign outside your room door to get faster service with the room cleaning. We figured this out after a few days. I was a little unsure of how I would like the main floor room, but it was perfect for us. I wouldn't want to change a thing. You never have to worry about seating on the beach, as there are tonnes of loungers. Some with cushions and some without. We liked the cushions. The small tables are an added bonus, but there are not very many of those. If you prefer to sit by the pool, you will have to get up pretty early to snag a great seat. All the activities are awesome. Thanks Chicken for a great time at the pool!!! All Staff members were truly great at whatever they were doing, from the gardener watering the plants to the staff that shone up the garbage cans (yes...daily...impressive), to the guy on the beach that picked up all the straws and cigarette butts, to the front desk staff...I could go on and on. This is truly a wonderful place to stay. We enjoyed it and will return, and we hope you enjoy it too.", "Date": "March 25, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "2", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Rochester, Minnesota", "Title": "\u201cGran Porto Real\u201d", "Author": "Bill O", "ReviewID": "UR126590158", "Content": "The facilities at the Gran Porto were very good. The Dining room staff and bar staff were also very good. The negattive review is based on our experience with the hotel security. We were robbed during our last night at the Gran Porto and the security staff were (in our opinion) incompetent. It took over 8 hours to get access to the listing of the indivudals that had entered our room. As an FYI, we were able to pinpoint the theft down to a 3 hour time frame. There was only one individual that had entered our room during the time frame when the theft occured. However, that individual was never questioned and we never recieved any follow-up. If you stay at the Gran Porto, please keep in mind that multiple individuals are given access to the rooms.....and every single day you will have at least 4 maybe 5 individuals entering your room throughout the day. (One person stocks the bar, another individual is responsible for housekeeping, another individual puts chocolate on your bed, another individual does a fancy towel sculptor, etc etc). A safe is provided in the room. And if you stay at the Gran Porto, keep ALL of your valuables in the safe. Unfortunately the safe is only the size of a shoebox.

We ended up declining the offer and after that our trip was fantastic. Our room was literally ON THE BEACH. The staff was wonderful. We especially loved Pablo! The trip was celebrating my 30th birthday. He hunted me down on the beach with a birthday cake and candle in hand. We loved the special attention. If you're wanting to sleep in in the morning, this probably isn't your place. The staff rolled big carts up and down the hallways in the morning and it was just flat out loud. The food overall was just okay. We found a couple of the restaurants at the hotel's sister resort across the street that were much better than the food at the Gran Porto.

Maria's Mexican Restaurant we found to be excellent food with a different menu each night. Service was so, so good - Rutillio and Lorenzo are experts at their jobs and make the best, THE best \"Mayan Coffee\" & equally good was the service and food at the Italian Restaurant. All these waiters take pride in how they look, dress, and carry out their job. Check in - room designation at checkin seems to be disorganized. Standard rooms are small - I think it comes down to what can you live with - smaller room or upgrade to ocean view or front. I want to see & hear the ocean so we upgraded to the ocean front. I read some negative comments about the pool activity organizers but we found them very friendly and always talking to many people.

We have stayed at the Gran Porto Real for the last 6. Originally we tried this resort because it was the only All-Inclusive hotel actually located in Playa Del Carmen and on the beach. The location is prime being that it is only one block off of 5th Avenue. The service at this hotel is unbeatable. Coming from a management position in the hotel industry, I have pretty high standards when it comes to service. I would do anything to have some of these employees working at my hotel. They really get it. This kind of service is hard to find. Pablo - waitstaff at the pool, Chiken (Victor) - entertainment, and Dave - Bartender at the swim up bar, remember us from year to year. It is truly amazing how they are able to do this with seeing so many people per year and we only travel their for one week. There are alot of kids at this resort and the night-life at the resort is non-existent. So if you are looking for a place to party, this really isn't the place. You have to travel outside of the resort for any night life. The food is so-so. Usually snack during the day and go to the Italian restaurant or order room service at night just because it is convenient. Breakfast buffet is delicious. They have upgraded the hotel a lot in order to try to make it a 5-star resort, however, I don't feel that it can truly be rated 5-star just yet. All in all, this is my favorite place to stay while traveling to Playa del Carmen. Special thanks to Pablo, Victor, and Dave for always making our stays memorable!

I felt that the customer service was the most impressive. Willy welcomed my family and I upon our arrival and continued to check in with us during the remainder of our stay. The wait staff were friendly and helpful, but like many others stated, the buffet food got to be a little old after a week. However, the Mexican restaurant down the street was fantastic. Best lamb and guava pie I've ever tasted. The food styling and plate presentations were perfect at both restaurants. It's definitely worth a picture or two. This is definitely a family type of resort, as far as entertainment goes. There is lots to do during the day including bike tours, beach volleyball, kids crafts, scuba lessons, garnishing and cocktail-making demos, bingo, etc. Thanks to Ivan, Miguel, and Rodrigo for making it a trip worth remembering. It's nice to have staff that recognizes you and remembers your name after having known you for only two days. The shows at night (which were pretty impressive) usually concluded by 9 or 9:30, which was okay because my family and I were usually beat by then. We're consider ourselves night owls, but the sun, along with the activities during the day, had us in bed by 10:30 most nights. Attending Coco Bongo was one of the best nights I had there. Amazing performance by talented dancers... a must see. A little crowded, but worth it. I would also suggest planning some day excursions to go snorkeling in Akumal or to see the Tulum ruins. Just watch out for all the salesman that will give you a deal to buy timeshares. They'll offer you free or incredibly low-priced excursions, but be prepared to spend 4 or 5 hours being talked into buying $40,000 worth of time shares. In my opinion, I think it's better to spend a little more money and refrain from attending any type of time share presentation.

I have stayed in many different hotels from Cuba, Mexico and Dominican. We stayed from Feb 27th - March 5th, traveling with Thomas Cook Vacations. Overall we had a good time on our holidays but not becuase the hotel or the staff did anything to WOW us. The Good: The Italian Resturant was fantasic, we had dinner here 3 nights out of the 7 and every single time it was fantastic! Walking Distance to 5th Ave was fantastic! I loved that the hotel was so much to shops, bars, and resturants but also a beach front property. Coco Bongs - This is a bar off the resort and you have to pay to get in but it is soooo worth it to go and see the show. This would have been my 4th time going to Coco Bongs and it was just as good as the first time! Don't worry about your age etc you will find people from 18-70 who go to see the show. Pools - the option to have two pools 1. The Main Pool with all the activities and tons of kids 2. the small Sushi pool. If you wanted noise and entertainment go to the big one if you want rest and relazation spend the day at the small pool Roof Top Hot Tub - This was our fav little place to go around 2:30-5pm everyday when there was no more sun at the small pool, the hot tub was warm, there were TONS of lounge chairs, and hammocks. Most days it would just be me and my boyfriend and felt like it was our own little hide away Day Trips- We went to Xplore and it was fantastic!!! Zip Lines, Swimming through the caves, ATV's, and Cannos. It was kind of expensive but it was well worth it!!! The food was fantastic!!! Bring Watershoes they help The Bad: Rooms - Yes I will admit I have stayed in WAY nicer rooms. If you are booked for a standard room here is what you can expect, a SMALL room with a huge bed. The Bathroom is very very tiny, with the sink outside of the bathroom. The Balcony was very very small, but overall you only spend a couple hours in your room sleeping and getting ready it will do. So who cares Food: The Buffett was good always lots to choose from (try the Nachos they are the BEST at the beach food area), the Mexican resturant was TERRIBLE. The worst FOOD and serivce I have ever experinced in my travels.. and I have had some bad stuff before. Checking in - It was fine, we checked in at 11pm at night and the hotel looked like a ghost town. No one asked up to upgrade. I had read reviews about the CREDIT CARD scam, here is your simple answer. Just tell them you don't have a Credit Card on you - simple! They didn't hassle us or question us at all for not having one. We did notice that when they were making copies of people CC's they would look at the back of the card.. not sure why but I can only assume they were looking at the 3 digit code on the back. NO one needs to look at the back of the card, if you feel comfortable with them making a copy let them but no need to look at the security code on the back Staff- After reading MANY MANY MANY reviews we noticed that everyone would mention peoples names in their review - well here is the answer why... The staff want you to mention their name in here because they get bonuses and incentives if their name appreas in these reviews. Great concept but not one person impressed up to include a name mention. As well I found it hard to get a true review of the resort as all people were doing were mentioning peoples names and not actually details on the place (hopefully mine helps you) Like I have said I have stayed in many hotels and this was probably the worst for staff interaction! The Activites team consisted of two people maybe (thats all we ever saw) they never made an effort to come and say hello, its kind of like they had their own little Clique. Out of all the trips I have been on this was the WORST exntertainment staff I have ever seen. The Lobby wait staff was terrible and never went around to ask us if we wanted drinks Entertainment - Again this was the worst I have even seen. The shows would start wound 8-8:30 and be done by 9ish. We wouldn't believe that the whole place became a ghost town at 10:30 ish. The lobby bar DEAD, this was just BAD BAD BAD! The only night we had a good time at night was Casion night when we got to play some Blackjack. Make sure you bring board games, cars, whatever to keep you busy at night. I understand 5th Ave is right down the road but they hotel should be providing good Entertainment. Beach - Knowing that you are right near the port to Cozumel you have to know the water is going to be choppy, and a little dirty. Yes there are sand bags to climb down to get into the ocean but they have to do this so the tide doesn't pull the nice beach front away. BRING watershoes as there are lots of big rocks in the water you can't see it and they hurt! Courtesy Room - Our bus didn't come to get us untill 8pm at night so they gave us 30 mins in a courtesy room to shower and get ready. Funny to see that this room was soo nice and BIG! It makes you a little pissed off when you know your room was nothing like this one I hope this helps any future travellers who are considering this hotel. It is not the best but for the right price it can be perfect! We paid 1050 for our trip from Toronto, if I had spent anymore I would have been pissed off with the lack of quality and serivce, but for a 1050 for a week its not the worst I have ever stayed!", "Date": "March 12, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Toronto, Canada", "Title": "\u201cAmazing resort!!\u201d", "Author": "J C", "ReviewID": "UR125962952", "Content": "This was our second time in the Riviera Maya, and first time staying at the Gran Porto Real.

Would like to especially mention Huber and Pablo, (the very attentive beach servers, who work so hard, remember everyone's drink orders, and always have smiles), Edouardo (hands out beach towels and is always friendly and very hospitable), Frank (pool bar), and Leidy (our maid). The servers at all the restaurants, including the buffet, are also the most attentive and hospitable people I have ever met at a resort. Thanks to all of you for making our vacation so much more memorable. The hotel itself is beautiful - we had a standard room, which was plenty of space, nicely decorated and very comfortable (our mini-fridge was always fully stocked). The pool and beach areas are great - right on the water with plenty of chairs and places to sit or lie. Location can't be beat - 5th Ave and downtown is right down the street and the ferry to Cozumel is a 20 minute walk. The food was very good. The buffet had a good selection, and the restaurants were just divine! Drinks were delicious, with plenty of booze and always tasting great. Overall, this was a great trip and an amazing resort.

We arrived on Saturday, March 3rd. Transportation to the resort was very nice and fast. Our transportation guide met us and we were off. When we arrived, check was a bit of confusion. We were to get a Beach Front Walk out, reserved from the start. We were told, two different stories, that our room was experiencing \"pipe\" problems and we could upgrade for the night at the Royal. Myself, I did not want this and told them to put us in an ocean view room for the evening until the room was \"repaired.\" Our other traveling party met with somewhat of the same results and were also put in an ocean view room for the evening. We checked later that evening and were told at the desk that we could get adjoining rooms the next day and we were a traveling party. When we arrived at the front desk the next day, things again changed and were told the clerk should not have told us that but after a little show of \"displeasure\", we were given the rooms that we were supposed to get. That was not a very \"friendly\" exchange from the supervisor that morning and of course, things were a little different from then on. But, we did speak up and got our rooms, by the way, were at a great location on the beach and the view was less obstructed than that of the other beachfront rooms. Enough on that--just don't fall for the upgrade talk that they want to give you!! The food that is served in the Albatros, the main buffett area, is basically the same every day. Some days you may have a little difference but not much. PLEASE eat the restruants that you are allowed on a nightly basis rather than the Albatros. The food served at these restruants are of very high quality and really good. Go early as well so you can get in quick and with ease. The drinks that are served are, I felt, watered down unless you tell them you want them strong. If you want a good drink, order the strong!! Now, if you are a couple just wanting to relax, find another place to stay. This resort is \"kid\" friendly and believe me, there were lot's of kids there. Kids are not the problem there, it's the parent's letting the kid's run them!! The pool are was full every day with kids and pretty noisy. We stayed on the beach most of the time and really enjoyed this. The \"drink\" runners are very prompt and keep you supplied, just throw them a small tip every now and then. Now for the big rip off. The world famous \"5th Avenue..\" Gosh, what can I say about that. This place is just like all the ports you visit when you take a cruise!! It's nothing but an over blown \"flea market...\" Same thing in all the shops.. And these people will do nothing but \"hound\" you all the time, step by step!! The prices are not that good either. We found better deals on jewelry, beleive it or not, at the airport on the way back home.. So, just watch out when you go there. If you just want to experience \"5th Avenue,\" good. I was not the least bit impressed. Overall, I really would have to say I had a good time, not a great one. The nightly shows are alright, just have a couple strong drinks before, during, and after. I will say this in closing. This was our first trip to the Playa area and we wanted to experience something different in the area away from Cancun. I will say that I won't go back there again. We have stayed in the Palace Las Americas in Cancun and will continue to go back there from now on. PLA has the GPR beat in many, many ways. I would talk more about PLA but I feel I shouldn't becasue this post is for the GPR. However, if you want more info, just ask and I will let you know.

This was my first time staying at this hotel and my first time in mexico. we booked this trip almost 2 months ago so I was reading up on it almost every day, reading what great things people had to say about it and let me tell you I was very disappointed. Guess it was my fault for getting my hopes up and getting so excited. Rooms: so everyone was was saying as soon as they went to check in that they would ask you to upgrade, well that didn't happen with us. Instead they stuck us in the other end of the hotel, away from everything in the smallest room possible!! no view of anysort, a small bathroom, a little balcony that only one of us could sit outside on and they room was very outdated. the only good thing about the room was the massive king size bed!! an hour after we checked in we went down to the front desk and asked them to upgrade because it was soooooooo bad!! they said to us that they didn't have any other rooms available all week. meanwhile the next morning we went down and were sitting in the lobby and we heard the person at the front desk asking the people that just checked in if they wanted to upgrade?? are you kidding me? very bad start to a vacation when you find out people are lying to you after you spend so much money to stay there food: the food in the buffet was horrible!! coming from a culinary background i was horrified to see that they would let them serve the food that they were serving. they used a lot of left overs from the previous services and a lot of it was tasted like it was sitting there for hours!! the cooks making the food looked like they were very unhappy to be serving you and the grills that they were cooking on were at too high of a temp. so they were just burning everything they would put on it. i've served buffet style food before and i just cant understand how a 5 star resort would approve of any of this food being served. the service at the buffet was great though. they always had a smile and were always at your table asking if you needed anything and cleared our plates right away. the mexican restaurant at the resort was probably the worst mexican food i have ever eaten in my life. I work with a mexican man at my work so he cooks mexican for me all the time... i was hoping they it would come somewhere close to what he cooks but boy was i wrong!!! The Italian restaurant was Great!! we went there 4 out of the 7 nights we were there and every time was better then the last. now that's how food should taste!! fresh, hot and finger licking good. STAFF: other then the waiters at the buffet and the maids that were delighted to see you and say hello to you every time you walked by them, everyone else seemed like we were a burden to deal with. i just don't understand why everyone is saying that all the employees were so nice. the waitress in the hotel bar was always giving us snarly looks every time we ordered a drink and the bartenders (other then dave, who works at the small pool) would always look at us and look like he was thinking to him self \"do i really have to make you that drink.\" well yah, it's your job and it's only a rye and coke!!! common now!! Over all i really hope that we just caught this hotel on an off week because i really don't see what the heck other people are talking about. i would not recommend this place to any one who's been to other 5 star hotels and want to enjoy themselves without having rude, moody people to deal with. if i wanted that i would have just stayed at home, saved $3000 dollars and visited our local holiday inn which probably would have been better!!! PS. if you're looking for a nice relaxing place just to have fun and not worry about anything like screaming kids and bad service stay at a adults only resort cuz this one was filled with kids and parents who don't know how to control them!!!!", "Date": "March 9, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Houston, Texas", "Title": "\u201cGreat resort, check in dreadful(unless you're the bride&groom apparently)\u201d", "Author": "atorres533", "ReviewID": "UR125862586", "Content": "I had my wedding here at this resort on march 3rd.

This review is why we like this resort. I just celebrated my 50th birthday at this resort with my wife and two sons who are in their mid twenties. My wife and I had been here twice before but this was our sons first time. To be honest we have never stayed at any other resort in Mexico. I often ask people while I\u2019m there if they have stayed at others resorts in Mexico and how they compare. Overwhelming people tell me this is the best resort they have stayed at. The food is very good. I must say that one year we had an upgrade that allowed us to use the facilities at the hotel next door (Royal). I can tell you that the Asiana & Pelicanos at the Royal are fantastic dining experiences. Besides dining at the Royal we enjoyed the Gran Porta much more because it fits us. The atmosphere at the Royal would appeal to people that enjoy a more upper class resort experience, but to us it felt stuffy. This is why we like the Gran Porta Real. It has a fun, warm family feeling. The staff is awesome, they take time to get to know you, they will joke with you and laugh with you, they go out of their way to make sure you are needs are fulfilled and you\u2019re having a good time. Each time we vacation there we get to know different staff members a little more than others. All the staff deserves recognition for providing such great hospitality. This time a few stand out, Jose (Lobby Bartender) & Miguel (Pool Bartender) are great! Always smiling and will make you just about anything you want. Cecilia & Elizabeth (Servers) were also wonderful! I have been teaching myself Spanish since our first trip to this resort and Cecilia & Elizabeth took the time to help me with my Spanish. So once again we had a great time! Because of the resort\u2019s warm personality I believe it attracts that type of quest which makes the whole vacation so much more enjoyable. We always meet so many great people when we vacation at the Gran Porta Real. Suggestion: I think it would great if when you stay at the Gran Porta Real for a certain number of days that one day should be an upgrade to try the facilities at the Royal. And they should do the same thing for the guest at the Real should have a day at the Gran Porta Real just to see what the resort is like and try the different restaurants. The Gran Porta Real was at full capacity during this our stay, however we never felt we had a long wait for dinner at any of the restaurants so I can\u2019t imagine it would create a problem with a one day upgrade.", "Date": "March 5, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Toronto, Canada", "Title": "\u201cAmazing time at the Gran Porto Real!!!!!!!!!\u201d", "Author": "Caralyn M", "ReviewID": "UR125675293", "Content": "Just came back from our first ever all inclusive.

We were greeted by Ricardo Hernandez at the front desk who made us feel very welcome and helped make our check in a breeze. As soon as we finished the check in the staff again took our luggage and us to our junior suite. The room was far better than I could have ever imagined and very well stocked with every type of beverage you could ever want. The hotel is so clean that it sparkles and you see the help cleaning everywhere you go. Every night we had towels made into the shape of beautiful birds decorated with flowers and candy on our bed. Ana M did a great job of keeping our room spotless and well supplied with everything we needed. The food was great and Filiberto at the Pescatore restaurant was the best waiter you could ever hope for, he even tried to teach me a few lines in Spanish but I was not a very good student and had fun trying anyway. We had a different show to watch out at the pool area every night and lots of fun activities during the day. Ivan took us bike riding and was so kind to us. I loved to swim in the pool and walk in the gulf and on its white sand beach. When I needed a snack I would get out of the warm sun and head inside to the air conditioned snack bar where Cicilia would be working very hard and had the nicest smile as if she was the happiest girl in the world. She told me she was excited because she was going to have a baby and I could tell that she would make a great mother. She also told me that she loved working at the hotel and it showed in her work. It would be nice if we all had employees like her working for us. I could go on and on about how great this place is but I won't, there are just too many good things to say. If you can, go there and see for yourself as you will not regret it. Thank all of you at the Gran Porto Real for making us feel so welcome and important.

This was our fifth time at this resort and as you might guess we like it very much. It is a small resort by Mexican standards (297 rooms); however, what you may not find compared to some of the mega resorts is more than made up for by the fine service you receive from the staff. Check-in took about 15 minutes. A credit card imprint is required; this is returned to you at the end of your stay. As you are attending to this you are served a refreshing drink. You are fitted with a wrist band; then the porter takes you to your room. We had an ocean view junior suite on the third floor. There is a good view from the balcony. These rooms are on the street side of the resort. There is a lot of activity on the road with tour buses coming and going during the day. We don\u2019t care about that as we are at the beach. At night the street is quiet. If you prefer, you can upgrade to an ocean front room which faces the sea. The weather was threatening rain the first few days so we requested to be moved to a room that had a covered balcony. This ocean view room was on the second floor and had a large covered balcony that we could sit on when it rained. We waited only one day for this request to be fulfilled; and it was done happily. Most of the rooms have king beds, with a few with 2 doubles. The suites are spacious and bathrooms have a walk in shower and a single sink. There are robes for your use. Plenty of good towels. The air conditioning is quiet and effective. There is a 4 bottle liquor dispenser for your use plus a bar fridge stocked daily with beer, water and canned soft drinks. There are 2 restaurants; one Mexican themed and one Mediterranean themed, as well as the buffet restaurant and a 24 hour snack lounge. The food is ok but the menu in the buffet is repeated each week. We always found something we liked. In the evening, you can check out the buffet, and if nothing appeals you can go to one of the a la cartes, as there is no limit on the number of visits, and no reservation required. Clothing there is casual to dressy, as you wish. A new innovation on Fridays is Steak House night. The buffet serves your choice of 3 cuts of steak; or chicken for those who don\u2019t want steak. The fillet was the best, followed by the rib eye. The steaks are small compared to what we are used to at home, but we enjoyed it! If you want lobster you will pay extra. They also offer a steak and lobster dinner on the beach that we had for Valentine\u2019s Day, but for $49 a person you had better hope the weather is nice. Our night was windy and the food cooled before we could eat it, but we enjoyed the experience. The beach is a work in progress. It shifts from year to year. I believe they have a handle on it now. Two rows of large sand bags were placed in the water and that has apparently changed the currents because there is a big improvement in the amount of sand being deposited in the beach area. There are small sandbags along the shoreline as well but these don\u2019t interfere with the use of the beach. There is a large area of shallows perfect for small children. My opinion is that the beach is improving here; even as it seems to be disappearing further south. There are many cabanas with curtains, we always saw vacant ones. There are plenty of loungers which people can pull further onto the beach for sun tanning. A snack bar serves hamburgers, hot dogs, fries, chips and dips. There is beach service for those who like a cold drink brought to them. The waiters are very good and deserve a tip now and again! One of the best features of this resort is the fact that it is built so it follows the shoreline. Every room is a short walk away from the beach! The pool area is usually crowded and if you want a spot you better get out there early and lay down a towel on your chair. The pool is not large but it is very, very clean. You won\u2019t see any debris drifting on the bottom of this pool! There is another, smaller pool with a swim up bar located on the second floor of the resort, next to the standard rooms. On the roof there is a hot tub with a nice view of the sea. The employees of this resort are a credit to management. They all seem to really enjoy their work. We want to mention a few standouts. First of all, Enrique Gio at the front desk. Enrique was willing to engage in conversation with us and because of this we were able to learn a little about the lives of Mexican people. Our vacation was a learning experience as well. Thank you! Teresa, a waitress in the lobby bar area, went out of her way to get us a little plate of cookies to take back to our room each night. Huber, Jesus and Pablo will make sure you are never thirsty on the beach! Antonio, Ivan and Jamie were standouts in the restaurant. Also, thanks to Ana, Arturo, Juarez and May for helping to make our Valentine\u2019s Day dinner on the beach something to remember! Last but not least, Juanita, for keeping our room spotless and for the wonderful towel art! The location of this resort makes it perfect for those who want to enjoy 5th avenue; the main shopping area for tourists in Playa del Carmen. There are many shops, bars, and restaurants. It is a great place to go if you like to walk and people watch! In conclusion, if you are looking for a resort that is very clean, has people who make you feel welcome at all times, and is small enough that you don\u2019t need a golf cart or hiking boots to get to the beach, then this is the place for you.", "Date": "February 29, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Pickering, Ontario, Canada", "Title": "\u201cTwo fantastic stays!!\u201d", "Author": "Shannon O", "ReviewID": "UR125397075", "Content": "This is a fantastic resort.

I booked just a couple of weeks before and got the trip for about 1/2 the price on Travelocity. It was for my sisters wedding and being a poor recent college graduate, I was happy my girlfriend and I were able to make it. The service was beyond excellent - you could be on the beach or near the pool and servers would be there to provide drinks around the clock. The wedding service was beautiful and the staff did a great job with the presentation of the food and decor. Location is top notch - if anyone is planning on traveling to Playa Del Carmen this is the PERFECT spot. It is located right near downtown so everything is just a quick walk away so I didn't feel \"trapped\" in one location all week. The buffet and restaurant food was decent, not great, but combined with the excellent service I would rate the overall dining experience 4/5 stars. My only gripe was that I was woken up a couple of times during the week with what I assumed were workers talking and chatting loudly outside our room. Overall, I would highly recommend this all-inclusive resort to anyone traveling the area. Also, I used Olympus tours as my shuttle to and from the Cancun airport, and also used them to book our one day excursion to the Tulum Mayan ruins and a jungle adventure zone where we did zip lines, rappelling, and snorkeling in the underground river systems. I had one employee in particular that made our trip so much more amazing. Her name was Kate from Olympus tours. I feel a lot of tour workers from different companies try and pressure you into things while only thinking about how deep your pockets are. Kate, on the other hand, really cared about us and gave us honest recommendations without pressuring my girlfriend and I into doing anything.

Technically there are two but the other one is on a roof top and in the shade 99% of the day. The rooms need a remodel. The floor tiles are cracked or chipped. The showers are not modern. The room furnishings are dated. The food in the buffet is at the most tolerable and the space for the buffet is cramped-hard to move from one station to the next and to see what is being served unless you butt in line. The beach is crowded and a public beach with reserved seating for the guests. There is no shade except for some pergolas. The beach has nice sand but you have to go more than 50 yards into the water before you get more than waist deep. The pool is crowded. We tried for three days to get 4 chairs together at the pool.

We are Canadians, francophones from the province of Quebec, fluent in both French and English with a little bit of Spanish. Both ourselves and our friends are retired & in our mid-fifties. This is our 2nd vacation in Mexico (numerous stays in the Dominican Republic) but 1st time at Playa del Carmen (PDC). We had a wonderful vacation at the Gran Porto Real. Beautiful and quaint resort, warm and welcoming atmosphere, great location. When facing the sea, the resort is to the right of the pier to Cozumel & 2 blocks from the 5th Avenue. The resort has wonderful staff who worked very hard to make your vacation perfect. We always had a warm welcome and smiles from all employees who speak English and a number are also good with their French. All of the resort is kept very clean, our maid Patricia was excellent & clean towels were always abundant. Beach: great beach, very large and long (sand bags are evident but no problem), lots of cabanas & chairs, service all day long from waiters right on the beach making sure your needs are met. You pick up your towels in the am and return them at the end of the day (near the pool). This resort is also very good for families & offers family junior suites & a kids club which resembles a daycare. The pool is very nice, not overlarge, good music & a very relaxed atmosphere with pool bar of course. Bathrooms are well located throughout the resort both inside and for beachside. Resort also has a beach snack bar with a simple but good menu (hamburgers, hot dogs, chicken, chilli, guacamole and fruits and more!) Just watch out for the sea gulls! Restaurants: the Albatross buffet is great & both food & service are very, very good. There is also a 24hr all inclusive \u201csnack bar\u201d, w/ coffee machines offering a variety of selections. Also, you don\u2019t need to make reservations for dinners a la carte! Both Maria\u2019s (Mexican) and Il Pescatore (Italian) offer excellent menus & great service, not to mention special menus for myself as I\u2019m celiac (allergic to gluten). We ate twice both at Maria\u2019s and Il Pescatore. Excursions: we booked via Best Day staff who work on site at the resort, accessible all day. Many thanks to Sylvia and Victor for their warm welcome and great services. Best Day works with the Real Resorts in Mexico for transfers to/from airport & excursion services. They are very reliable, trustworthy & work hard to make sure everything goes smoothly. We took a full day excursion for Tulum (Mayan ruins) & Akumal (snorkelling w/sea turtles); booked via Best Day with \u201cGo Natural Adventures & Expeditions\" which are great. We had an excellent tour guide, special thanks to Yair (pronounced \u201cJahir\u201d) for his attentive care to our needs, great source of information on both ecological, historical and archaeological subjects. And funny! Strongly recommend this excursion. Also, special thanks to our personal guide at Tulum, Ram\u00f3ndo, he was fantastic. We had a late check out and the hotel provides a hospitality suite for 1/2 hr to shower & clean up. Suitcases are very secure & safe. System for check out is smooth and well organized. A special mention of thanks to the following Gran Porto Real employees who were great and so friendly and made our vacation extra special: At the Albatross buffet restaurant, Marcos & Gustavo . At Maria\u2019s, Rigoberto who is a fantastic and great guy & the team he was working which included Edgar, Chef Edi and Capitan Antonio. At Il Pescatore, Ton and Ramiro as well as Jorge & Yoni & the Chefs. At the front desk, Claudia and Paul. At the 24h All Inclusive Club, Elizabeth and Teresa.

Also a special mention of thanks to the employees who work at the luggage and concierge desks, sorry, wasn\u2019t able to catch all of their names. We definitely intend to return to the Gran Porto Real & definitely recommend this resort for a great vacation, whether you are travelling as a couple, with friends or with family and children.

The resort is beautiful and the location to the ocean is ideal. The junior suites are very nice (we had 2 for our family). Our biggest problem was the Gran Master Suite (3rd room for our family) that we reserved, was not at all like they advertised. The pictures and layout showed the bathroom and a large closet between the living room / dining room and master bedroom with a central access to the closet and bathroom. It turned out that the bathroom was an ensuite to the master bedroom, so anyone sleeping in the living room / dining room has to walk through the master bedroom in the middle of the night to use the bathroom. When we brought it to their attention the first day, they said that this Gran Master Suite configuration was only available at their Royale Playa del Carmen across the street (adult resort only). After the trip, I contacted the hotel by email about some sort of refund (staying over Christmas, and paying a significant premium on a room configuration that does not exist at their resort I find unacceptable) they confirmed in return emails that they were aware that the room we got was not as advertised; however, they did supply us with a Grande Master Suite, so no refund. It was hard to remember through all of this that their Mission Statement is \"Exceeding Your Expectations\". Food was average. House wine was less than enjoyable (barely drinkable), and if you want to order off a wine menu be prepared to pay $90US plus per bottle. Also, make sure you don't get a room across from the housekeeping storage area.

We decided to try Playa del Carmen this time though and will definitely return! We loved the area, the ease and safety of walking on 5th Avenue and especially the resort - Gran Porto Real. The atmosphere was not the loud, partying group often found in Cancun - but more quaint - and busy enough if you wanted to partake in activities . The staff was always attentive and going many steps beyond what would be expected to make the vacation memorable. We ate all meals except one at the Albatros buffet and loved the service and the variety of foods. It is impossible to be hungry there! For the one meal we strayed - we went to the Italian restaurant on site, and though it was lovely, and it was nice to be served, the selections were not as great and the quality not any better than the buffet. so - we returned to the buffet. On our last night there - February 17, there was a special sit down dinner - steak night which was more than amazing! The wait staff was even more attentive if that is possible, and the food presentation was delightfully elegant. Antonio was our waiter and we cannot say enough about how special he made us feel that evening. There was truly not one staff member who disappointed in any way.

Our daughter was married at the resort, and I was truly overwhelmed by the attention given by the hotels Wedding Planner, Lisa Alvore, and Manager, Marco Ramos. Their attentiveness to our daughter and son-in-law, and their attention to detail in every aspect of the wedding and reception was absolutely impeccable. They are true professionals in every aspect of their profession. While the wedding was planned for the beach (with chairs, tables and covering set up early that day), the rain came about an hour and half before the ceremony. But before the rain had hit the beach the staff had quickly moved the furniture to an inside alcove/hallway that looked onto the beach and ocean. The location was perfect and the wedding planner saw to it that the guests were informed, and the wedding went on as scheduled. The reception was perfect, from the h\u2019ordevers served prior to reception to the exquisite meal served during, and the staff was constantly attentive but never obtrusive. We found all of the resort staff friendly and accommodating. It was if the word \u201cno\u201d was not in their vocabulary as they continually went out of their way to make sure we were taken care of. A particularly noteworthy staff member was Jose Lopes who serves in the Italian restaurant at the resort. We had the pleasure to be served by Jose on two occasions during our 7 day stay, and found his hospitality engaging and his service impeccable. While the buffets selection and food quality was first rate; if I could offer one suggestion it would be to put big warning sign close to the buffet tray that holds the hottest habanero chili peppers one can imagine. Both my wife and son sampled, and both felt the pain. The rooms were clean and well-appointed and were pleased with our decision to upgrade to a jr. suite ocean FRONT room. Initially we had an ocean VIEW room, and as is typical of many resorts, the term ocean VIEW means the ocean can be viewed..........by leaning over the balcony. Overall though the experience was outstanding, and I would highly recommend the resort. I hope each has the great holiday we enjoyed at the Gran Porto Real.

We find the staff at the resort is always very helpful and we\u2019ve become close with several of them over the years.

Maria\u2019s Mexican Restaurant: Featured a different menu every night with foods from different Mexican regions. Our friend and waiter Mario is absolutely awesome. Ask for him the next time you go. The entire staff is excellent as well, including Diego, Edgar, Mariano, Sergio, Rigo and Alberto (bartender). Chef Edi always made our meals to perfection. IlPescatore Italian Restaurant: The staff here is fantastic as well. A special mention goes to Ton (a fluently tri-lingual waiter) and Elias. We also want to mention the chef Ehrique Salgado; he too made our meals to perfection. Beach waiters: We had the pleasure of meeting Jose, Pablo and Mari and they were always happy to bring us drinks from time to time. They walk back and forth from the beach to the beach bar and they work very hard. Please remember to tip the beach waiters if you can. Room cleaners: The rooms were cleaned daily.

While the GPR is smaller than recent resorts we've visited, it offered everything we were looking for... nice pool... beach... good Kids Club, etc. But what really made our trip was the staff. Ivan, Cesar and the rest of the activities team warmly engaged our group (5 kids, 10 adults) and had us playing volleyball, doing water aerobics and taking dance lessons in no time! Jose, Miguel and the rest of the servers were quick with refreshments and took great care of us. The front desk staff were very welcoming... special kudos to Enrique. The staff as a whole made this a great little vacation! The food service in general was excellent. And, while the quality of the food wasn't always the best, the service was impeccable. We especially enjoyed their Italian restaurant, Pescatore's, where Mateo, Tony and staff were extremely accomodating. Again, I was very skeptical about Italian cuisine in this setting, but the chefs at Pescatore's nailed it - we dined there 2 nights in a row! The other surprise was the GPR's 24 hour, self-serve area, where snacks and drinks were abundant and super convenient! Overall, I was very pleasantly surprised!

Edwardo brought a smile to my face every time a picked up a towel in the morning or dropped one off in the afternoon. Upon going to this resort, I didn't expect that I'd feel such a sense of community and meet friends from around the world. The activities at the pool were for all ages too, not just kids. Pool volleyball or salsa lessons were a great way to break up the day of relaxing and tanning. Even if you're not looking for a communal feel, this resort is also perfect I think for those who just want to relax on their own. The beach is beautiful. The rooms were very impressive, even the hallways with their open-air style were impressive. The food was good. There is a Mexican restaurant, Italian, and a buffet open during the day. As a vegetarian, I didn't have any problems. The Italian restaurant I found was extremely good. Lastly, I think it's important to note that the resort is in a superb location.

The hotel itself is small and very charming. A lovely family hotel that makes you feel safe, comfortable and welcome the moment you walk through the from door. Everyone at this resort deserves a heads up but a few definately stood out among the crew. Big thanks to IVAN for getting my extremely shy daughter to take part in the activities. She looked forward to water volley ball everyday and of course the amazing arobics workout in the pool.Thanks to Chicken for the towel art instruction. And I thought folding a towel would be easy! Thanks to Mari at the pool. You never left us without a drink and you always greeted us everyday with a lovely smile and a warm greeting. Our morning breadfast guy always get the name wrong Florencio? Always prompt with coffee and OJ. The food we found to be good. Always something on the buffet to fill a plate. I always tried something new everyday and was always pleasantly surprised that I always liked it. The Italian a la carte was nice and the service was excellent. The Mexican was OK and the service was excellent. I think that the only thing that I would suggest would be to have a pasta station at the buffet each night and to cancel the sit down friday night steak dinner. Being that friday was our last night we really missed the buffet. The beach grill was good. I didn't like the burgers but everything else was excellent. Guacamole, salsa and chips for lunch yum! All in all it is Mexico and you are at a Mexican hotel. Expect Mexican style food. The rooms as far as I am concerned were lovely. We stayed on the third floor. An ocean front suite. Beds were a little firm for me but clean with deluxe linens and clean pillows. I thought that the rooms were not outdated and had plenty of space. Large closet but not enough hangers and No dresser to put clothes in. Just two small drawers in the armoire. The bathrooms were nice with large showers. Tip* Had to leave the shower run for a bit to get hot water. Do not fret it will turn hot after a short wait..... Lovely patio with a hammock that stretched across. My daughter loved to stretch out here in the morning to catch up with her computering. Wifi was a little iffy sometimes but in general worked fine. Always had fast wifi reception in the lobby. Mini fridge worked fine and was always stocked. Liquor cabinet does not have top shelf brands but I am sure it would do for a quick drink before dinner. The room also had a DVD player and some english channels we never had any trouble finding something to fall asleep too. Overall, I would return to this resort without hesitation. Loved the location. Just a short walk to 5th Avenue. To all of you that are there now or are soon to be going I am jealous and wish I could be there too.

This was our first stay in Playa del Carmen although we did a day trip to there last year. During our day trip we scoped out the GPR and decided we would stay there rather than in Cancun the next time we were in the region. We had liked the location just off 5th ave and being right on the beach. We weren't at all disappointed with our decision. We had actually booked the lowest grade room to get a cheap rate and planned to upgrade when we got there. Upon arrival, we asked for an upgrade but there wasnt a full week upgrade available, unless we moved to the Royal PDC. We've stayed in the Royal in Cancun and LOVED it, but we had firmly decided we wanted to stay at the GPR. So, we stayed in the standard room we were assigned. We knew what to expect in a standard room so we weren't upset or surprised. The room was basic with two double beds, bathroom area, mini fridge and no balcony or view. However, we actually really enjoyed the room (#411). We were on the same level as the Tranquility pool, its swim up bar and sun loungers. It was nice to spend the early part of the day just 14 steps from our room. As this area of the hotel faces east, it only gets sun until about 1 PM. Over the course of the week our maid service was excellent, as was the towel art. There was street noise only on Saturday night, otherwise it was quite quiet after midnight. Most days after lunch we hit the beach or the pool. We never had any problems getting a great spot on the beach. On only one day did we have trouble getting loungers by the pool. We went to the beach for an hour then came back to the pool and found two loungers side by side. Being a smaller hotel, it has only three main restaraunts, Maria's and il Pescatore ala cartes and Albatros buffet. We were satisfied with breakfast and lunch at Albatros, but most nights had dinner at the ala cartes. There's enough variety in the menu's that the two are fine for the week. We also had a special night on the beach. For $100/couple we had a 4 course dinner (salad, soup, steak and lobster entree and desert) on the beach, accompanied by a live Jazz band and our own waiter. Upon returning to our room there was a chilled bottle of bubbly and two tall wine glasses. Well worth the money - thanks Ana Elise! A big plus is not having to make reservations at the ala cartes. In fact we stopped in at Maria's twice, just to have the Mayan coffee as presented by Sergio. Sergio is an excellent waiter for dinner, but his Mayan coffee is outstanding. We also visited the 24 hour bar a few times and had a late night snack or two. The liquor bar was very well stocked with Dos Equis on tap, quality international brand spirits, wine and Champagne. Entertainment wise, the live shows by the pool are enjoyable. They're done by 9:30.The Lobby bar bands are OK and usually play until about 10:30 or 11:00. Each band we saw has at least one strong perfromer. One night the guitarist was channeling a Jeff Beck'ish groove and on another the Cuba Jazz band's Bass player was awesome. We didnt really interact with the hotel entertainment team other than some pool Volleyball, so I cant comment on them. The hotel staff were all very friendly and provided a very high level of service. On the beach and around the pool Pablo is the go to guy. Mari on the beach also kept our glasses full. In the Albatros, all the servers were very attentive. Shouts out to our man Chuchin. If you're wondering if we tipped, we did. We didnt tip everytime a drink was served but we did recognize the servers for their efforts. As we waited for our transfer to the airport I dropped into the lobby bar for a going away drink. Aurelio poured me an Adios special - a stiff shot of Don Julio! I guess he had me figured out by that point. I had no pesos left and he didnt expect any so we parted with a handshake, gracias and adios. Overall we really enjoyed our stay at the GPR. We met great people from the good old USA (Tom & Nancy), fellow Canadians from Fredricton (Rod & Norma, Tom & Rolond), Montreal, and Edmonton (Bro-mance), Linda and her old retired husband from the UK, and others from Sweden and elsewhere. So, yes we would recommend this hotel. we truly enjoyed the staff and the facility. Could it be better? Sure it could. There are areas that need updating. The free wifi is a little spotty and we could have used another option for lunch (a Sunset Grill, like at the Grand Caribe). We don't rate this hotel as Excellent, as we've stayed at excellent Mexican resorts before (ie the Royal) and this isnt the Royal. However, its an awesome All Inclusive Resort for a great price so we rated it very good.", "Date": "January 29, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada", "Title": "\u201cAnother Great Holiday\u201d", "Author": "wannagoback48", "ReviewID": "UR123812034", "Content": "This was our second visit to Gran Porto Real.

We ate at the Italian restaurant 2 nights and the food was good. Entetainment staff is very good as well - Chicken and Cesar are very entertaining!!

I cant really add much to what has been said by others about the upgrade scam and quality of the rooms. Upon check in you will be asked if you want to upgrade, and be offered this at \"half price\". We refused and were then (eventually after being hassled to go to a presentation over the road) shown to one of the \"Standard rooms\". All I can say about these rooms is that we have been in better 2 star Greek Island accommodation, they are the worst rooms you will ever have the misfortune to stay in, unless you upgrade. We bit the bullet and paid over $500 to get a decent room. When we explained to the Thomson rep that we expected the rooms to be 4 star standard as this was a 4 star package holiday we had paid for, he seemed bemused, and told us that the standard rooms were not 4 star, and just very small and very basic, and that they had been very clever with the camera when taking the pictures for the brochure. THIS IS THE THOMSON REP TALKING. The Junior Suite we ended up in was the type of room we had been expecting and apart from the constantly dripping shower (which they asked us to give them half a day to knock the wall down to repair it) was ok. We refused obviously, and decided to try and forget the fact that my wife was in tears at the quality of the Standard Room, and start afresh. It was at this point that we also realised that Thomson advertise this hotel as having eight restaurants. We could only see three (the Mexican, Italian and buffet). The hotels own map they hand out when you arrive showing the position of all the facilities, only shows these three restaurants. Upon our return we pointed this out to Thomson Holidays only to be told that the resort staff confirmed that the hotel had eight. You will have to make up your own mind on that one because neither my wife or myself are registered blind people. (Again the on site Thomson rep confirmed at the time that the hotel does not have eight restaurants.) If you take away the very poor standard of the rooms and the missing facilities then the hotel isnt all that bad. By the time you have added on the cost of the room upgrade though, you can get far superior accommodation for the same price, and I mean FAR SUPERIOR !!! I would not rate the hotel as the 4 to 5 star it is advertised at, more 3 to 4 star depending on which rooms you go for, On a positive note the staff are very good and cant do enough for you. Food is ok, but the theme nights in the restaurant were great.

The staff at the resort is very friendly and do their best to speak English to you, they are fast and extremely accommodating. The beach and pool bar service are also very fast and friendly. I wish they had a third restaurant instead of just the Mexican and the Italian. If you eat the at the buffet for breakfast and for lunch it is nice to go eat elsewhere for dinner. I love the part that you did not have to make reservations to any restaurants on the resort, you just went when you wanted which is great. If you are conscious of your salt intake this is not the place for you, everything is very very very salty, almost takes away from the taste of the food. There is a Sushi bar by the pool on the third floor that I would strongly agree you stay away from, ruined 3 of our seven day trip and I am back home now and I still don't feel really good and I am going on day 5 (after taking many gravol and inodium). We saw the waiter come and get one platers from the sushi bar and filled one up and covered it up to take away and the rest he put in the trash. In my opinion if they say they don't reuse the sushi why wouldn't he have not thrown the whole trays away!!!! Good question that none of the food staff could answer after we got sick. It is a shame that happened, when you only have 7 days and 2 or for travelling you hate to waste 3 of them really really really sick. The chef did try to accommodate us with some food that would try to settle our stomachs and a dinner which was really nice of them, but we weren't feeling well enough to appreciate it. I felt bad for all the effort they put into it to make it up to us, maybe another time. The bars do close down early since it is a family resort, but then when the Blue Parrot kicks in, it kind of defeats the purpose of closing down early not to keep the kids up. We were on the 3 floor with a ocean view, maybe it is not as noisy next door at the Royal or other parts of the hotel. Did I mention how hard they work to keep the place shining clean? You always see someone cleaning, non stop. the only concern I have is at night when I gets busy in the bar and they run out o glasses I noticed more then once that they give a quick rinse under the tap and serve that drink...yuk!

The Italian restaurant was better than the Mexican restaurant and the buffet for breakfast and lunch was always a treat.

I would likely mention some of the names if they stood out beyond the others, but to be honest, everyone was above average and everyone deserves credit.

There is a photographer on site named Bernardo - any of you visiting the resort should absolutely get a photo shoot done. He is a fantastic photographer and the prices are very reasonable (we would have paid 3X the price we did in Canada). We purchased a set of pictures that we will cherish for a lifetime. One word of caution for those of you who are looking for more of a party scene - since the hotel caters to family, things do quiet down fairly early in the evening.

We picked this property mainly becasue of the location and we've had good luck with this chain in Cancun (see my review on teh Gran Caribe Real) We elected not to upgrade to a Junior Suite, and I was a bit apprehensive at first, since when we were given the \"tour\" of rooms, when they attempted to upgrade us, they showed us a room below pool level.. you literally had no view and could see inside the pool... it was freaky and I wasn't looking forward to staying there. But, we decided it wasn't worth the cash to upgrade, so we checked in anyway and to our surprise, they put us way at the other end, closer to the street above the Italian restaurant by the \"cold\" pool - or what we lovingly call the torture chamber (it's freezing because it gets no sun whatsoever) We ended up liking out little quaint room, it had two double beds but I liked the genuine feel of it, totally not pretentious and the bathroom was fine, great shower! All the windows opened, which was nice. Really, how much time do you spend in your room anyway? We are out and about 95% of our vacation.

We ate at all the restaurants, the Italian is yummy and be sure to eat the rolls with the creamcheese inside! We also were able to eat at the Asian next door because we are return clients of the Real chain, so we had our Black bracelets. It is unreal the food is so good!

The drinks here were awful.....worst I have ever had anywhere ever....I tried to stay away from the enticing sugar on sugar drinks and ordered only cranberry vodkas and mojitos....which were watered down to the point of grossness....I had to start requesting my drinks strong and the bartender would comply by filling the glass 3/4 with \"vodka\" and a few splashes of juice and it was STILL extremely weak....We ended up going down the beach about 1 minute to COCO MAYA most days and PAYING for delicious food and drinks....$8 for a margarita which I sipped on for the majority of the afternnon (and only needed 1 because it actually had booze in it) they have the best chicken wings by the way!!

The bands and entertainment go until about 10:30 or 11:00 each night - Just like Brad173 noted on December 28, 2011 review there is a Credit Card scam going on there. I had read that review and watched carefully on check-in. They run your card and then flip the card over and write down the 3 digit security code from the back of the card. With your card number and that security code (the hotle doesn't need that if they physically ran the card) they can go web shopping with no problem. I scratched out the code from the card imprint, so hopefully they won't go shopping with my card Tips: - Watch the Credit Card scam mentioned above - To get better tasting drinks, just specify what specific brand of liquor you want. I found their house brands to be weak and flavourless as others have noted here. Just say you want \"smirnoff and orange juice\" or \"tanqueray and tonic\" instead of \"vodka and orange juice\" or \"gin and tonic\".

After having some problems in the front desk about our room, we had a fairly decent room # 226 with a limited sea view. I decided to upgrade our room to sea view after couple of nights in the old room. The second room # 359 was excellent with a stunning sea view. I highly recommend to pay extra 40 USD for the sea view, but make sure you are facing the beach front. I was offered also the beach front with an instant access to the beach, but I would not recommend it, because who have no privacy unless you have closed curtains all the time. Please make sure, who have a junior suite!!! Service was outstanding. The only problem was New Year\u00b4s gala dinner with a la carte dinner. The waiters were not able to keep up with the usual high service level and sometimes mixed the orders. The other problem was the breakfast with a constant line up to ten people waiting for eggs to be fried. The lady working behind the stove was not able to keep up with the numerous guests wanting to have omelett or fried eggs at the same time. You had to wait for up to 10 minutes to have your order done, which is difficult for a family with small kids. The numerous bars in the hotel were functioning fairly good, but occasionally you got a little frustrated, when you have ordered your drink and then comes a waiter serving for beach clients and he has orders for ten people. The bartender takes the waiters order first even the the waiter came after you. I had to remind couple of times about this problem. The beach is not very good for swimming for adults, being too shallow, but if you go just 200 m to the left to Royal\u00b4s beach, the swimming is perfect. For kids Gran Porto\u00b4s beach is good, even though the sticking sand bags are not very nice looking. Overall we were very with our choice, Gran Porto. We think the personnel was doing their best to make our staying as enjoyable as possible. The last, but not least was the excellent 24h buffet with bar for self service in the lobby.

This is a beautiful walk and you can look at and or visit the many bars that are along the way. We also really enjoyed both pools, the downstairs one during the first part of the day, and then the upstairs during the second part when it was getting really hot. There is a lot of shade up there and it is more quiet than other locations - we also enjoyed the swim up bar. Their sushi bar was pretty good as well. There were a few kids around but we really didnt mind. My fiance and I also went to the gym every day and really enjoyed it. It was nicely air conditioned and maintained. They had water with fresh lemon available. The food was good - breakfast buffet had a lot of options including fresh fruit, for lunch we mostly went to the beach for burgers, fries and nachos. For dinner we tried each restaurant and enjoyed that as well. The portions were small but I feel like this made us be able to try many more items than we normally would at an american restaurant. We went on an ATV tour and an \"Edventure Tour\" and would recommend both - I wish we had also gone horseback riding. Finally - DO NOT waste your time listening to a presentation across the street at the Royal - they will offer you 500pesos to go do it, however we felt it was high pressure and they would not let us go easily.

Food: The breakfasts were amazing and the lady who makes the omelettes was a pro. However things went downhill when it came to lunch and dinner. Do not bother booking at this hotel if you are a vegetarian. There is barely any choice of food especialy on steak night where we actually had to get up and go to the a la carte as there was not a single option for vegetarians. I did mention i didnt eat meat and they said to me \"what would you like to eat? Pasta? \" Pasta is all i ever had here. They do have grills where they are making a variety of food but they do not understand why you don not want your vegetarian meal cooked away from the pork and beef so I had to stay away from these too. Desserts - poor apart from the ice cream. The staff in the buffet restaurant weren't particularly helpful with providing vegetarian food so we spent the majority of evenings alternating between the 2 A la carte restarants which were a little bit more accomodating. Rutilio in Maria's restaurant was lovely- very helpful and made a fabulous mexican coffee. I did get sick of the food after 2 weeks as there were about 3 things i could eat between the two restaurants for a fortnight. Beach I saw a lot of comments on here about the sandbags but went with an open mind. Unfortunately they do make the beach look very ugly and the sea has random rocks in the seabed and my husband came out of the sea one day with a large bleeding cut from one of these rocks. Not ideal! It wasn't the prettiest beach to look at either. The sea near the Royal is better but I have seen a lot better. A big positive thumbs up to the beach bar waiters though -Jose and Pablo-absolutely lovely. Location Adjacent to a shopping street (5th Avenue) which is fabulous to walk through after dinner although prices are a rip off so don't do all your holiday shopping here. Stuff can be found a lot cheaper elsewhere. Reception: Didnt find the staff very friendly here and stayed well away from the reception area for the duration for the trip. Although a lot of the staff are genininely kind, there are also many who are just nice purely for your tips -you can see the difference. Check in took over 45 minutes and it wasn't even that busy Rooms: Very clean but dated and dark. We were on the fourth floor and had considerable noise one of the weekends we were there from one of the neighbouring rooms where there was a group of young people drinking into the early hours. The walls are thin and although the noise was so loud and sounded like it was next door, it was 5 doors down! horrible! We did complain but reception were very unhelpful. The rooms have no privacy unless you keep your blinds closed. Overall: It is the only holiday we have been on in our lives where we were almost pleased to leave and will certainly not be going back to. It was one of the poorest quality (apparently) 5* hotels we have ever stayed at. Although Mexico itself is beautiful, there are plenty better hotels to stay at.

My question is if you wanted to stay at the Royal you would have booked in the first place. We were in a junior suite on the first floor near to the reception and never had a noise problem. The room was very spacious with a large shower and seperate hand basin area. There is a large king sized bed and plenty of seating and storage. There is a safe provided free of charge that you input your own code. Food is served buffet style in the Albatross dining room and there is plenty of choice from freshly made omelettes at breakfast to themed nights for evening dinner. Ther are two seperate restaurants that you can dine at, one being a Mexican and the other an Italian. We tried both of these and we were not disappointed. There is a 24 hour snack bar near to the lobby bar replenished on a regular basis and help yourself to drinks when the bars close. The pool is of a good size but you will have to get out pretty early to grab a sunbed and towels are supplied. There is a bar at the pool called the Gaviatos which translated means seagull and if you take your lunch at the beach buffet you will soon realise where this name comes from. The beach is made up of sandbags layered on top of sand and is adequate and make sure you have a walk to the Trade Winds beach bar for a drink and sit with a great gentle breeze just looking out over the ocean. Although the hotel was full at our time you never feel overcrowded or rushed. The centrepiece of the hotel has to be the Lobby Bar where any cocktail or drink can be had. This is run by some of the best bartenders I have ever met and a special mention has to go to Dave, Alberto and Chris.

We booked a standard room which was a big mistake. It was awful, nowhere in the brochure did it mention having to climb up wooden steps to get to the room. The room itself was just so dark with hardly any natural light. If you dont mind living out of your suitcase (there was nowhere to hang more than a couple of items of clothes and no drawers) then you might manage but if you want something more then you have to upgrade. We had to pay 9030 peso's to upgrade to a Jnr Suite for the standard of room we expected to stay in but ,I must say that this room was great and if we had been shown this room to begin with our overall score of the hotel would have been much higher. Cleanliness of the hotel and the friendliness of all the staff was superb, food was not brilliant but OK and you would never go hungry here. We were offer a transfer to Caribe Real in Cancun for the second week which we accepted and preferred the location much better. The CR staff were not as good as GPR and the Jnr.Suite was not as good either but it more than made up for it as we were placed on the VIP floor with access to the VIP 24hr lounge which had food and upgraded drinks available all the time. The transfer was to try to get us to join the Real Club and we were shown round the the Royal Hotel next door (adults only) which was fantastic. A short presentation was given explaining about the Club and its benefits but when we refused to join we weren't put under any pressure at all. It was a bad start to the holiday which was a shame as the rest of the time was great so if you are thinking of staying here look at upgrading before you go as it is much cheaper than when you are at the hotel. All of the computer screens on the reception desks at all of their hotels are showing \"Why not upgrade your room\" and I personally believe that they put you in the worst standard room available so that you will have to pay for the upgrades. If we had known how much it was going to cost to upgrade we would probably have chosen a different hotel.", "Date": "December 30, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Sleep Quality": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Edmonton, Canada", "Title": "\u201cHow does this get 4+ rating?\u201d", "Author": "Garret P", "ReviewID": "UR122207875", "Content": "Definitely the worst all inclusive I've ever been in.

My wife and I got married at this resort at the beginning of December. We had 50 guests come with us. At our reception, three of our wedding cards were literally ripped open and the money was taken right out of the cards. Our on site wedding coordinator then delivered the cards to our room the following day (along with our decorations and other stuf that needed to be returned). When questioned, she flat out lied to our face and said that she did not deliver the cards to our room. We talked to management about it, but they basically said they dont care but will look into it. They never got back to us regarding the missing money. Now since weve been home for a few weeks, our guests have been notified (either thru the credit card company or when they were doing christmas shopping and had their credit cards denied) that their credit card had been being using fraudently in Mexico and on the internet. Now let me state a fact here. At check in, they require a credit card on file for any expenses you may charge to your room or for any damages to your room. None of our guests left the resort during their stay and if they did do some shopping they only used cash. So being that they were at an all inclusive, they put their cards away and did not touch them again till they got home. Each day it seems that another one of our guests finds out that they were victims of credit card fraud. So put the pieces together. the people working at the resort were the only ones during their stay to have access to their credit card numbers and all of a sudden, weeks later they are racking up tons and tons of bills. Over $9,000 on one persons card. Thankfully, the credit card companies are taking care of everyone, but this is very very bad business. I in fact will never go back to this resort or any Real Resort for that matter. Ive done extensive traveling in my time and never had anything like this happen. Also, there was some stuff stolen out of peoples rooms. (i undertand that this does happen from time to time at places like this, so I wont really make a big deal about that) but to have mutliple people taken advantage of with their cards is just unheard of. We are completly embarressed about this and dont know what to do. Soooooo, if you dont care about possibly getting your money stolen and would like to visit here anyway, here is the rest of my review. It was a decent resort, set in a good location on the beach and a two minute walk into Fifth Ave. The beach was nice except for the all the sandbags, but they are trying to do what they can to fix it. The pool was nice and a good temperature. Breakfast buffett was great everyday, especially the omlettes. I mostly ate lunch at the poolside shack where they set up pretty much the same food everyday. it was decent, and got boring but I could have easily went inside to the lunch buffett which was sometimes really good to just alright. Dinner at the buffett was good and had a lot to choose from, Italian resteraunt was really great (pay the extra to get the lobster), i myslef did not eat at the mexican but all our guests had mixed reviews. Our room was nice but could use a little updating (we had an ocean front walk out suite). Our shower had cold water all week, but the room was nice and spacious. Our wedding was wonderful. everything turned out better than we had thought (except for our cards being ripped open). Drinks here were nonstop, but not very strong at all.....very hard to catch a buzz. there was essentially no entertainment here which was disappointing as other resorts weve been to had entertainment that was really good. They really had nothing going on at the pool during the day, and at night they set up near the pool and had a lousy show for about 30 minutes. one night i went back to my room for a few minutes and came back out and the show was over (within 10 minutes)....... Anyway, we were upgraded to the Royal for a few nights....(still trying to figure out if it was because we brought 50 guests there or if they felt guilty about our money missing) but everything there was great. I would never go back to this resort again because of our horrible experience there.", "Date": "December 28, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Corozal Town, Belize", "Title": "\u201cReal Club is a SCAM: Do NOT Buy!!!\u201d", "Author": "truthwithproof", "ReviewID": "UR122185041", "Content": "Note: Our ratings here are based on the actual hotel but our following review and WARNING is based on the Real Club membership that they will try to sell you. DO NOT BUY A REAL CLUB MEMBERSHIP!!! We spent HOURS with them while our kids were made to sit in a corner with a babysitter with no offer of food and only one beverage offer because we HAD to go through the presentation at their Royal hotel which doesn't allow children. We thought the deal sounded very good, they processed the deposit on our credit card and THEN AFTERWARD they showed us a list (which they had briefly glossed over in the beginning and even put in the \"get back to later pile\" when we didn't understand it) again detailing the \"Member Preferred Rates.\" The BIG emphasis is on all these credits you get to use and with the bombardment of information, you assume that all you need to do is use these credits (1 for standard room, 2 for junior suite, 3 for 2 bedroom, etc.) whenever you want to use one of the Real hotels. They NEVER clearly tell you (until after you have committed) that you STILL have to pay for the all inclusive for EACH person on top of using so many of your credit points (the all inclusive for food and beverages is MANDATORY). AND, the rate you pay is according with their Member Preferred Rates chart which is not cheap! When you question this, they say, \"Oh, but you don't end up paying what's on this list; you end up getting much better deals than this at the time you book.\" But, there is absolutely no guarantee of this. When you review the contract, it only states that what you have to pay is in accordance with the Preferred Rates list. So, in brief, you pay tens of thousands of dollars for the program depending on the number of credits you buy and depending on whether you want to be able to stay during high season periods--like Christmas, New Year, Holy Week--(e.g. $20,000 US for a re-sale for 450 credits and no stays during high season special times, to up to over $80,000 US for 20000 credits and open stays) BUT you still HAVE TO pay for the all inclusive each day, per person, ON TOP of this. We worked out we'd still be paying well over $400 per night for us and our two boys for Jan (after Jan 01) to Feb stays, ON TOP of our membership payment which was nearly $20,000 US!!! And get this: When you review the Member Preferred Rates list, you realize (afterward) that the all inclusive rate GOES UP according to the size of the room you book. So, not only do you use more credits for bigger rooms (which is obviously fair enough and to be expected), you also PAY MORE for the all inclusive per person. Hang on, isn't the all inclusive rate per person just for food and beverage? How can they justify paying more for all inclusive per person simply because you book a bigger room? Then you realize that it's such a scam. We just didn't feel right after signing up and making our deposit. We went over the contract in fine detail and found a clause that allowed us to cancel within 5 business days of signing as long as we hadn't used any of the gifts. We went through another hour and a half worth of being passed off from one person to the next to try to cancel (they keep sending different people your way to try to convince you not to cancel). Only when we stayed firm did they finally process the cancellation. BUT, the first guy who \"handled\" us tried to pull one over us by telling us we'd still have to pay some fees and charges for cancelling, to cover their costs for various things. We didn't see this anywhere in the contract and stated so, showing them that the contract said we were due a full refund as long as it was within the 5 days, so they dropped that one. We told them we actually still liked their hotel Gran Porto Real Playa Del Carmen and would still strongly consider returning whenever we found online deals (we phoned the hotel chain directly on Dec 24, 2011 \u2013 yes, Christmas Eve - and they gave us a last minute deal of only $280 per night all inclusive for the four of us, no extras fees, for Dec 25, 25 & 27! See how it would have been insane for us to go through with the membership \u2013 which excluded peak periods \u2013 when we can get deals on our own like this EVEN DURING peak season) BUT only if they would, in the essence of good business practice, at least compensate our poor boys (who had missed out practically a whole days worth of activities and the food that we\u2019d paid for). Their answer: They avoided answering our request until we made them process the cancellation and then they rudely told us \u201cwe were free to go\u201d with nothing but the original 500 peso voucher they HAD to give us because they had used that as an incentive to get us to the presentation in the first place. Now we will never return to any Real hotels nor recommend them to anyone.

When we arrived we were shown our standard room for my husband, myself and our 8 year old - it was along a row of doors a little like prisoner cell block H and when we entered the room it was like a small cave - ok if your the flinstones - it was appalling. Shower room no bigger than a small cubicle w.c. and where do you put your clothes, there was a 6\" gap to hang a few items between the lot of you, that was it, needless to say the cases didnt even get unpacked. I went down the next morning and was asked for 590 dollars for the two week upgrade to a junior suite, but i did get this somewhat cheaper as i threatened to book out the hotel. We were moved to a junior suite near reception at the top of the stairs and directly above the live entertainment for the night, needless to say we did not get a wink of sleep, then the hotel was filled with Americans who were extremely loud and obviously had no consideration for any1 else. We complained. Next night same again till 1pm and when we came to open our room door there had been a food fight on the landing with cakes, bread, coffee and drink directly outside our door and so we were unable to get out. Again we complained and were offered alternate room with a free further upgrade, which i have to say was a stunning room, but my argument is this, never have i been into a 5* hotel where you have to continually upgrade to get a decent room, is this not what you pay for when booking into a 5* hotel - it seems not here. Then watch out for the timeshare people who are actually in the hotel as they are promoting the Royal which is part of the hotel across the road, if you get stuck in there it is a 6 hour visit not 90 minutes as they ask of you. The food, apart from the breakfast is of poor quality i think for this type of hotel and the entertainment is okayish. The excellent points for this hotel is that the cleaning staff around the hotel and the rooms was of a very high standard, almost to the point that they got on your nerves, constantly cleaning around you while you were eating. If you are prepared to pay the extra 590 dollars for the upgrade when you get there it will be a good stay but personally when yyou have paid that much money for the hotel, in my opinion it should come as standard that you actually get a nice room.

I will start with the bad because it was very little. Food: While I don't normally complain about food (my expectations aren't high for Mexico) this was terrible. I keep reading about how good it was...I unfortunately got very ill and basically spent two days in bed, or the bathroom...Now my husband didn't get sick at all. He thought the food was wonderful. After getting that sick I was just so unsure what to eat. I think they let the buffet food set out too long without the correct temps. I did like the 24 hour lounge the finger food there was very good. We did have access to eat at the Royal, however, they are pretty stuffy over there so we didn't feel comfortable. But the food was really good there. Noise: The first 7 days were fantastic, we had an Ocean walk out (talk about later) so we didn't hear any noise except the ocean. Well then the Blue Parrot opened down the beach, they would play techno music until 4:30AM every night!!! We complained and I'm sure we weren't the only ones. You figure between the Gran Porto and the Royal they have a lot at stake. I couldn't imagine staying in the hotel right next to the Blue Parrot...just saying you might need ear plugs if you stay here. Hopefully, they will have so many complaints that the Blue will turn the music off outside. The Good Hotel: The hotel is very beautiful and well kept, very very clean. I've seen mention of tired rooms, ours was just the opposite it was wonderful. Easy access to 5th avenue and quick from the airport. Beach: I've seen comments about the sandbags. This must be from people that dont understand they have to do this or they wouldn't have a beach. Also, very few sandbags were present. I thought it was an awesome beach. The best part about Playa Del Carmen is getting to walk the beach grab a beer from the beach bars ( you can't do that in Cancun). Again we stayed in the beach front walkout and it was right next to the beach bar. I've noticed no one comments about the beach bar at this end, it was super! Thanks to Fabian and Omar, they were wonderful bartenders, miss you guys! We are beach people, we spent everyday on the beach. Pools: We never even got in the pools however they looked very nice and clean. Lots of people around them, again since we didn't use them I won't comment much. We did go up and look at the pool on the 3rd floor, but we never went back. It faces the road so I wasn't too impressed and wasn't sure why anyone would stay up there... Rooms: This had to the best room ever, we had an Ocean front beach walkout, room 155. This room was amazing the bed a kingsize with pillowtop matress. So I'm guessing that if you don't upgrade to the nicer suites you just have a standard bed. We had six pillows too:) Stocked fridge with soda, juice, water and beer. We also had some snacks but they only replaced them twice. Walk in Shower that was huge! Now you did have to run the water for about 10 minutes before it got hot...our room was spotless, our maid Patricia did a fantastic job. I never thought I would write about towel art...but it was always fun to see what she would make us each day:) Had an Ipod home, and flat screen TV one of the best rooms I've stayed in! Tipping: I think most people who go all inclusive don't think they should tip. I know different cultures think differently too. We tipped our everyday, the 24 hr lounge waitress, the maid, the bartenders, we didn't tip alot but it went a long way.

The reception area is very grand, though not to my taste at all. The loooong corridor to our room was also very smart and had a colonial feel to it. The rooms, in contrast, are very outdated and shabby. The junior suite was huge, but lacked character and ambiance. The amateurish paint effects on the walls and ceilings are meant (I assume) to give the place a 'Mexican' feel, but they did nothing to warm up this cold, characterless hotel. Our shower was broken, so we had no hot water in the morning. It was fixed promptly, though, after a call to the front desk. We had a tiny balcony (with no privacy) overlooking some sort of promenade and a sliver of a view of the tiny beach. I gather much of the sand has been eroded away by the sea, because the pictures we saw on the booking site showed a much larger beach area. The room was very far away from the beach and pool area, and there was no real 'resort' feel to the place. After settling in we ate at Maria's, a Mexican a la carte restaurant. The food was ok, although it was not served as described on the menu because the ingredients weren't available. The cocktails/mixed drinks were awful, and made I suspect with inferior alcohol and sweet bottled mixes (which is true for most bars and restaurants in PDC, by the way).

The Gran Porto Real Resort was awesome. The casualness of this resort makes for a very relaxed and fun vacation. The staff are absolutely amazing. Friendly and always smiling and happy. Very helpful and full of great info about the area. A large number of the staff are very good at english. Here are a few of my favorite staff. PABLO, one of the servers on the beach. Such a great guy!! IVAN, a server in the buffet restaurant - another wonderful staff member. And also Chicken, Daniela, Miguel, Victor, Alberto and Mary at the gift shop. Pepe at the Italian restaurant. These servers are all wonderful at what they do!! You will not be disappointed if you stay at this resort. The Italian restaurant on site is very very good!! As is the mexican restaurant and buffet is great. They had a oriental theme at the buffet one night which I didn't like too much. But other than that one theme, it was great. The lady who makes the omlettes at the buffet is a treat to watch. She makes a fabulous omlette!! The nightly entertainment was great too. All the activities throughout the day are fun! On Monday and thursday nights, they have a few local artisans that set up their wares around the pool area and you get a chance to buy wonderfully made jewellry, painted tiles, woodcarvings that are authentic and without the pressure you would expect on 5th ave. Buy one of Martin's 'finger' painted tiles. They are so beautiful. And say hi to Alberto who is at the booth with Martin.

We just can\u2019t express enough what a great place this is. You can walk anywhere on the property and the employees are always smiling and asking how everything is and wanting to make sure that you have everything you need. From the start of our vacation in the lobby to the end we always feel like we meet so many friends. I don\u2019t mean to sound corny but the employees are amazing. From the start Aaron took care of our luggage when we arrived and took care of us the whole week. He was always helping us out with any questions. Aaron ways had a smile and a hug when we saw him. The security is great \u2013 they are constantly checking the beach day and night and they are always making sure you have a bracelet on when you enter and leave \u2013 the bracelets are not uncomfortable nor do you even realize they are on. We thought the 24 hour place had upgraded since last year. They had very good finger type foods and plenty of beverages. I have to mention Teresa \u2013 I met her the 1st time we stayed there and she still remembers us when we come back. She normally works the beach but when we were there she was in the Lobby Bar. She is such a nice person and always has a kind word to say. She is the best. We always had breakfast at Albatros - the omelets are fantastic and if you don\u2019t want that there are many other things you can find or they will make it for you. We did lunch at the beach stand Parrillada Grill \u2013 great nachos and french fries -also had hamburgers and hotdogs. At night we would go to Maria\u2019s or il Pescatore. Service is excellent at both places and so is the food \u2013 we did like the change of menu each night at Maria\u2019s but il Pescatore had super lasagna. We also noticed that people from the Royal were enjoying the restaurants at the Gran Porto. We did room service one night \u2013 very good. Very prompt and they asked us to give them a call when we were done and they were up to our room immediately to pick up the trays. The service at the beach - can\u2019t say much more the EXCELLENT. All you have to do is ask and they will get you what you want. If your drink is not strong enough just let them know and they will get you a stronger one. Always came by with water \u2013 good idea. We were on 2nd floor ocean front \u2013 nice big balcony with a roof \u2013 which I would ask for next time. Before we had a small balcony and no roof \u2013 we enjoy sitting outside for cocktails at night and it was nice to have a bigger area. Watching the hotel and ocean change into nighttime was great. We were by the pool area and could watch the entertainment from our balcony. The entertainment was over at a reasonable hour so loud noises were not an issue. The shower is super \u2013 I have to laugh but when we were there last year our group was always commenting on the showers. Very roomy and good water pressure. Plenty of room to put toiletries in the shower and very nice towels. The bathroom is large. Safe is big enough for a netbook \u2013 probably a laptop but I did not have that.

To all of the tourists from around the world who have never had the opportunity to visit Mexico or have listened to all of the negative reviews, comments or news casts regarding Mexico; you are truly missing out on a very special experience and meeting the most beautiful people in the world. There is more to Mexico than drugs and tequila. Open your eyes and minds and broaden your horizons to experience one of the most beautiful cultures and countries in the world, which is M\u00c9XICO. Why not start by visiting the Gran Porto Real Resort & Spa, the gem of the Mayan Riviera!!!! Again, I am very sorry if I have excluded mentioning anyone, it was not intentional. Mi Familia Gran Porto Real para siempre en mi corazon. PARA NUESTRA FAMILIA GRAN PORTO REAL, UN MUY SINCERO AGRADECIMIENTO DESDE EL FONDO DE NUESTROS CORAZONES. REALMENTE TE PIERDAS TODOS MUCHO!!!

The room was kept spotless and the cleaner left us a different towel animal every day which was really sweet. Our room included 4 optics with a litre of non-branded vodka, rum ,whisky and tequila, and our mini bar was re-stocked daily with bottled water, beer and soft drinks. The beach was so goegeous that I walked along it every morning and watched the fishermen sailing out and also throwing nets from the beach. The main buffet restaurant called The Albatross had the most amazing choices for breakfast. Ranging from made to order omelettes, scrambled egg, fried egg, fresh fruit, sliced meats and cheeses, freshly squeezed fruit juices (about 8 different types) croissants, porridge, sausages, various mexican breakfast dishes that I had never heard of, chicken nuggets (yes thats right! LOL) jams, yogurts, freshly made waffles and pancakes, various breads. The only thing I can criticise is the toaster. Its a huge thing that looks like it was made about 20 years ago and is so so slowwwww. We must have spent ages queing at the toaster, waiting for it to pop out at the bottom. But thats a monir gripe really. There is a snack bar on the beach which opens at 11-30am and serves basic food like hot dogs, burgers, tortilla chips, cheese sauce,beef chilli, chips and fresh fruit. The other 2 restaurants, one Italian and one Mexican are also free to use whenever you want. The service was excellent and the food was pretty good too. There's a 24 hour self service \"cafe\" just past reception which has a choice of about 7 different dishes such as chilli, soft cheeses, fruit, danish pastries, cereal, meat skewers, mainly things to snack on. It also has a selection of spirits to help yourself to e.g. smirnoff vodka, bacardi (normal and gold) tequila, gin, whisky and also various wines, tea and coffee and a soft drinks dispenser and a beer pump! I heard there was a bottle of Baileys one night, but someone pinched it! This is also where there are 4 computers with internet access. 20 minutes costs 20 pesos (about a quid). The pool was fairly small, but the hotel is right on the beach, so it didn't really matter. Plenty of sunbeds on the beach and the waiters were amazing, constantly checking if you needed a top-up. We were regulars at the tradeWinds bar located near the Jetty and Dave the barman made some brilliant cocktails, my favourite was the \"Mexican Flag\". Try asking for one if you go. There were plenty of activites organised during the day e.g. bike rides, kayaking, spanish lessons, water aerobics, beach volleyball. The local is located about 200metres from fifth avenue where there are lots of touristy shops, bars and restaurants. We went to the Texan Burger restaurant a couple of times because the food was really great - onion rings to die for! There are plent of places to visit in the area, we went to Xel-ha (google it) and swam with Manatees which was amazing. Overall I would say the staff are some of the best I have ever met. Very efficient and always smiling which is very unusual. Our holiday at Gran Porto was superb and I am hoping to come back in the near future.", "Date": "November 29, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Grand Forks, Canada", "Title": "\u201cgran porto real-something for everyone\u201d", "Author": "Barbara B", "ReviewID": "UR121175026", "Content": "Nine women went for a two week getaway and we had a great time.

The location is great - step out of the lobby and you\u2019re 1 minute walk to 5th Ave. 2. The staff is so friendly and accommodating. Willy from the welcome desk was very charming. Our waiters Juan Cavich and Amabiael were so attentive that my wife found it difficult to stay thin and sober during our week stay. There\u2019s also a Mario Lopez-lookalike at their italian restaurant Piscatore that she had the hots for. Don\u2019t forget to try the nachos at the 24 hour Lounge at the lobby. They taste great like authentic Mexican homemade tortilla chips, not the commercial kind from Doritos. If you plan to visit the Mayan ruins (Chichen Itza, Tulum, Coba), we highly recommend getting Gonzalo from GoNatural as your tour guide (you can book the trips directly at the hotel lobby). He is the most entertaining and knowledgeable tour guide in the area. If you\u2019re not laughing from his funny anecdotes and antics, you\u2019ll be deep in thought thinking about the alternative theories he discusses on Mayan history and culture. He\u2019s very passionate about his job, and some of the things you\u2019ll hear will blow your mind. We were fortunate enough to visit Coba while the government still allows tourists to climb up the steps of the tallest pyramid in Yucatan, the Nohoch Mul pyramid. Don\u2019t miss the Coba tour, because (like Chichen Itza and Tulum) climbing up the pyramid will be forbidden soon by the Mexican government.", "Date": "November 27, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Mexico City, Distrito Federal, Mexico", "Title": "\u201cGran Porto Real what a great discovery!

The staff at this resort were outstanding. Upon arrival, we needed to switch rooms and the woman at the front desk (Claudia) went out of her way to make us extremely happy. This continued throughout our entire trip, she went over and above and made our stay at the GPR impeccable. Two waiters on the beach, brothers ( Pablo and Jesus ) also for both trips made us feel very special, treated us like family.

We are not beach, pool or outside activity sort of people, so for our needs this hotel did not meet our expectations in the least. Heavy mould smell (almost suffocating) in the elevator, shower, and one entire wing of the hotel. The rooms are nicely air conditioned, but the buffet, hallways are not (open to the outside), so it is sweltering hot and uncomfortable to enjoy. Room balcony was so small it was difficult for 2 people to enjoy a drink out there. Food was mediocre cafeteria food and was very disappointing. There is no one enforcing hand gel usage at the entrance of the restaurants. We were looking very forward to visiting the Mexican restaurant, Maria's, but it was mostly American dishes and was sadly lacking the yummy Mexican food we were craving. The Italian restaurant was good. The room (Jr Suite Ocean View) had a gorgeous view and was spacious, but we had to call Maintenance to fix the air conditioner that leaked a puddle on the floor, and to fix the shower that wouldn't drain. A soft drink accidentally blew up in our fridge and it took 3 days for housekeeping to clean it! Be aware all restaurants shut down at 10 or 11pm except the 24hr snack bar which has about 4 or 5 items (which were dried up & horrible). No room service after 10pm. If you have late night munchies, you're out of luck. Very limited activities & shows (1 an hour but not a great variety). Free alcohol but drinks were mediocre and inconsistently made. You never know what you'd get! Pool closes 9pm. I do have to say that all of the staff we encountered were incredibly pleasant, friendly, and the majority spoke English enough to communicate. Hotel in a fantastic area with shopping a couple of blocks away on 5th Avenue. Good night life until 11pm - streetside bars & restaurants. Lots of little street shops open til 10 or 11pm. Wal-Mart is close enough to walk. All the locals we encountered were quite friendly and spoke quite decent English which can make non-Spanish-speaking visitors comfortable. Taxis everywhere with friendly drivers asking if you need one. But mostly everything you'll need is within walking distance. For many tours, hotel has a bus that will pick you up so you don't have to worry about that. Forget about wearing pants in this sweltering humidity. Shorts, tanks, dresses, bathing suits. Lots of little places within a couple of blocks open until 10 or 11pm. Some restaurants & bars open later. Great little Cuban bar nearby with live entertainment. Not much in the hotel itself. There are some \"tacky\" shows at nightime in the hotel, but virtually nothing after 8:30pm, so you will have to go outside the hotel if you're looking for something to do besides get drunk on free alcohol.", "Date": "November 23, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Ottawa, Canada", "Title": "\u201cGreat staff, great location....will be back\u201d", "Author": "Sands76", "ReviewID": "UR120965675", "Content": "I have just returned from my second visit at the Gran Porto in PLaya del Carmen and once again I am delighted with my experience at the hotel.

I'm a beach girl and spent most of my time walking up and down the beach. I love the fact that you feel like you are in Mexcio and can watch the fisherman get ready for their working day.

The food at the buffet was basic and decent, but nothing too fancy. The two a la carte restaurants (marias and il pescatore) were both very good. Although the portions were average, the food quality was great in the dishes that we tried throughout the week. The lunch-area near the beach (i forget the name) was consistently good. Id like to make a special comment in relation to Pescatore restaurant. Our group went on a fishing trip on day and brought (2) barracuda back to the hotel for preparation by the restaurant. The staff took a lot of care in ensuring that the fish was prepared to our liking and also arranged a special dinner reservation for our group to feast. When the food arrived, it was prepared WAY BEYOND OUR EXPECTATIONS. The kitchen staff did an unbelieveable job in accommodating our request. I would have never expected the resort to take this much care in fulfilling our request. Onward, our room was very clean, although starting to shows some signs of age. Getting fresh linens and supplies were never an issue during our stay. Our room was situated at the north-end of the resort and due to the configuration of ours and 4 other suite doors being very close together, we were able to hear every single door close and open, and every door knock which did wake us up a few times. I suspect this problem is isolated to only a few certain areas of the hotel. The pool area was great at the Gran Porto. It was spotless (as was the entire resort) and the service by the beachside and poolside waiters/waitresses was outstanding. The service that we received from all employees was top notch.

The food and service at the hotel is brilliant, the Italian restaurant being our favourite of them all!! The rooms were gorgeous, we upgraded before we went to the Junior Suite, which im glad we did, it was well worth the difference in price!! The staff at this hotel work so hard, they are constantly cleaning, painting and serving you with drinks, they are an asset to the hotel!! The hotel is also perfectly positioned at the heart of 5th Avenue, the bus station is at the other end of the avenue so you can easily get to Cancun if you want to save money and not get a taxi! The beach is gorgeous, myself and my boyfriend walked it every day! Okay, there are a number of sandbags on the beach right outside the hotel, but this is too stop the beach from eroding, what else can they do? Without them there would be no beach!! Once you step over them which it is easy to do the water is clear, or just walk a couple of meters down the beach past all the boats and you have perfect flat sand and sea!! Cant complain! We visited this hotel as part of a package holiday with Thomson / First Choice, the rep at the hotel was called Ricky! He was brilliant, so helpful. We booked a lot of trips with him and he gave us loads of advice about local attractions, shops and restaurants, as well as tips on how to deal with the shop owners on 5th avenue! Thanks Ricky for making us feel at ease on holiday! The only negative point I have about the hotel, and it was quite important, was the noise within the room we had. It was as if the walls were paper thin, noisy boys next door, music down the street, footsteps and trolleys going down the corridor above and outside did become very annoying, when they wake you up in the middle of the night. I know it would be hard to do much about this, but it is a big flaw in the hotel. Despite the above myself and my boyfriend would definitely return to this hotel.

The rest of the staff was just as accommodating. In particular, Delia, Tonny, Eduardo & Jesus deserve special recognition. They each went out of thier way to make our stay at Gran Porto Real a \"special\" one. For example, Tonny sent a piece of chocolate cake to our room for our 5 year old. He noticed she was sad earlier in the day so he asked her to name her favorite dessert. She told Tonny that she liked chocolate cake.

In their defense, they were clean. Staff seemed nice enough, my husband could not find anybody to give him change (so we could tip). The buffet wasn't so hot but again the staff was polite. Both days we were gone on excursions, so we really didn't get the full flavor of the hotel. I just felt like it was a little low end as far as rooms. Lots and lots of families and kids in strollers, not my type of vacation venue. I'm sure it would work for families with kids but not so much for couples.

The service provided by housekeeping, room service and restaurant staff were outstanding and I would say the best service in terms of speed, friendliness and going above and beyond in meeting your needs - especially when I did not request anything! Everyone is constantly working incredibly hard. The second reason to stay at the Gran Porto is to eat dinner at Maria's Restaurant every night, it serves excellent Mexican cuisine with a daily regional menu reflective of Mexico's cultural diversity. We had many different servers in all restaurants and everyone was superb, but I would like to mention Huber, Osorio and Mauro, Salvador, Jesus and Mariano.

We were a bit concerned about the weather but we were on holiday so it didn't worry us too much. After an hour on the coach we arrived and were greeted with lovely cocktails to start our holiday off. It was quite busy at check in but was an easy process and it went very smoothly, we were offered an upgrade to an walk out ocean front room, which we had a look at but for an extra \u00a3750 we decided to stay in the original junior suite that we had booked, and as hurrican Rina hit whilst we were there we were glad we did. The rooms we had were lovely anyway. They were cleaned daily by our lovely maid Lissett who did a fantastic job in both of the rooms we had, The kids had there own room and she made lovely towel art for both rooms. All the staff at the GPR are fantastic, I have never been anywhere that has got such lovely friendly staff. Our favorite staff need a mention so I will start with David in the main pool bar, he was great fun, all the staff at this bar are great and make such lovely cocktails, the beer is good too, my husband loved the beer on draught but my friend and I always drank the cans of Sol, they were freezing cold and soooo good on a hot day. Pablo was great on the beach and was always coming around offering us water and taking our order for any other thing we might fancy at the time, my fav were the mango tangos, yummy, Eduardo was the lovely friendly guy that gave us our towels everyday, he was always so friendly and happy. Alexs (i think that's how you spell it) was the life guard on duty on the beach and did a great job, also sooo friendly and very reassuring when the Hurricane hit, It was our anniversary whilst we were there and my husand and our friends we travelled with booked the Surf & Turf dinner on the beach, I would recommend this to anyone, the food was fantastic and the setting was stunning, I will never forget that night as long as I live, so special, a big thanks to Tom our waiter who made it such a special occassion. Daniella on the entertainment staff is such a lovely girl and has the most beautiful smile, thanks for the aqua aerobics Daniella, it was fun. The food here was unbelievable and so much to choose from, Our fav was the Mexican resturant and we went there a few times, Try the mayan coffees they are supberb. I did get a bit fed up with the buffett but that was only because we all ate far too much and were there for two weeks. Rina arrived on the 27th Oct and she was a Tropical storm by the time she hit us (thank god) but the staff were amazing the whole time and I didn't feel unsafe at any point, I did feel sorry for some of the staff that night as they finished shift at 11pm and had to get home to their own families who they must have been very worried about, but they didn't show it, just kept on looking after us, ( thank you all for that as it must have been hard). Would we return here again? YES YES YES, in a heartbeat, I probably wouldn't ever go again with Thomson/ first choice, it was like going longhaul with easy jet, worst ever experience with an airline, just rubbish, everything is an extra, very small luggage allowance and charged nearly everyone for going over on their luggage allowance, (20kg, not a lot if you are going for 2 weeks) if you go over it is \u00a315 per kilo. Drinks on the plane are pricey and to watch all the films you have to pay extra, So have your purse with plenty of money on the way out and the way back for them. Next time will look at BA probably work out cheaper in the end.

Aaron Pat and Alexander Hernandez ,Bell Boys, went out of their way to help us also. Prior to the storm was a week of beautiful sun and sky so I will now discuss the fantastic time we had. The bars: Trade Winds has a new bartender Dave,excellent drinks and always a good time.The umbrella fella,Evelio, at Tradewinds greeted us every morning with a smile and put up our umbrella to keep us cool Beach/pool bar ; Miguel previously at Tradewinds is now there and still holding court with delicious drinks and fun times.David is there with him and sometimes in the Lobby bar too. We invinted a Hurricane Rina drink and it will forever be \"our drink\" David called it \"Rina with a B\". The beach drinks were delivered with speed by a most beloved group of tireless workers who bring us joy every time we visit they are. Teresa,Jose,Jesus,Pablo love you guys ! The food was outstanding Eleazer the food manager does a supurb job mixing it up,the ribs out at Parrillada were delish.The addition of Steak Night at Albatros was also a pleasant suprise.Mexican night a huge hit too.The 24 hour room ,staffed by sweet Elizabeth who is also interning at the front desk ,is always kept cool and has different treats and full bar.Elizabeth is a great hostess .Shirley the hostess at Albatros is so friendly and always greets us with a smile. Edwardo at towels continues to help us with our daily spanish lessons never tiring of the fact we are terrible students. Jorge at Il Pescatore and Mariano at Marias served us a special and delishious dinner,the best lamb chops ever! .Patricia our housekeeper thrilled us with towel art everyday she kept our room spotless.Snorkling out front was great many tropical fish to see and the lifeguard Alexis kept a watchful eye on us.There was a new girl just starting ,Adriana, who was pleasant and will make a great addition to the fantastic staff already there. The Mexican restaurant changes the menu nightly and we had some of the best food ever there.Tuna,duck,lamb,corn soup the chef outdid himself. In closing The Gran Porto Real once again proved to be Vacation Paradise for us,give it a try you will love it too. ***Our vacation was extended 3 nights due to Tropical storm Rina(and Delta cancelling all flights) so we went to the Gran Caribe Real in Cancun to be closer to the airport. A trip report also there.

Made me angry because it's 2 1/2 hours wasted on my vacation. I guess I was gullible to think they were just showing me so I can stay there in the future. So beware of the \"tour\". Other than that it's perfectly situated right next to 5th ave. Had a blast there!! Day and night!! After all that I'm torn whether or not I would recommend this place to a friend.

The concierge was nice, they try to sell you an upgrade and you have to meet with a host who will try to get you to buy some sort of membership. Luckily, Ernesto, our host was more than a sales person. He was our go to the whole time at the REAL for questions, taxi's, advice etc. He was very helpful. The first room we had was on the second floor above the pool and lobby. nice room, but very loud. the next day they moved us way down to the other side of the hotel. ocean view on the the 3rd floor. room 354. The room was just incredible. The room was always clean and our maid left the cutest towel animals. The kids loved it. I was expecting the food at the main buffet to be less than stellar from the reviews. We were pleasantly surprised and actually preferred the buffet to the other restaurants. We have 2 kids - 2 & 8 and they always found something to eat. The pool area is nice. Jose was my waiter the whole week and he was just on top of it. very friendly and my drink was always full. the pool is clean but feels small since it is spit in half. The food at the pool bar is nothing fancy. Hamburgers and hot dogs. everyone writes about the sand bags. didn't bother us so much. the beach on the real side is amazing. you can take a short walk and use the beach there. the best part of our trip was renting a boat - Muneca, right behind the Real. We spent $35 per person and we were taken to this snorkeling area and we got to swim with turtles. there were 4 of us, but we were not charged for my 2 year old. Best money we spent the whole time. they have a kids club that we stopped in a couple of times.

GOOD POINTS :- 1:-Beach Is very close with good soft sand . 2:-Water is shallow easy Bathing /Swimming. 3:-Staff are always cleaning. 4:-Location Is good for 5th Avenue. 5:-Animation try hard in the evening shows,some are very good. 6:-House Maids are very good (Lillianna) looked after the room very well with daily Towel art to amuse us,well worth the $20 u.s dollars tip. 7:-The Italian (Il Pescatore) has good table service with good food although Limited if staying for more than a week.by far the best this hotel has to offer. 8:- Overall it's a clean Hotel,in a good position with good access to the beach ,Although access to the sea can be difficult due to sand bags directly behind the Hotel. BAD POINTS:- 1:-The Time Share People hassle you continually ,Even direct Phoning to your Room,They Contacted us 7 times over the phone in two weeks,that's without the constant hounding every time you walk through the Reception,there Desk is just off the Reception so you have no choice but to run into them . 2:-The Front Desk are on Commission to upgrade you to the sister Hotel The Royal we were asked for $1,200 u.s for 21 nights,it's cheaper through your own Rep ,They seem to make up the figures as other couples were quoted different Prices for the same Package as ourselves,so BEWARE. 3:-Food is O.K for 7 days after that it is repetitive ,the Buffet is at best Terrible ,lack lustre Frozen food ,poor deserts ,No Fish only frozen dried out & Cheap. Meat is tough to chew & are cheap cuts very small Off cuts i expect from the Mexican & Italian Restaurants. 4:- The waiting on in the Buffet is best in the evening ,even if you tip you will be greeted with slow service in the Mornings & Lunchtime Menu. 5:-The Pool ,small split into two Nothing to inspire you here. 6:- The Americans ,they seem to own this joint they are loud & Obnoxious when in groups, yes there are nice Americans too when on there own ,But in groups all you get is YAHOOOOOO all day & Night Loud & Louder The Hotel definately caters for them . 7:-The Bars in the lobby,pool area are all Plastic glasses horrible cheap plastic ,you know the ones you squeeze your drink overflows,.But the bar staff are good very good actually you don't wait for a drink when tipping ,no tipping you see there selection process NOTE:-We Upgraded from the start to a junior sweet with seaview & were Charged \u00a3450.00.By our Agents First Choice ,It was Paid for in full prior to leaving the U.K. Upon Arrival we were booking in & were asked to choose One of two rooms available to us ,THE FIRST ROOM was a STANDARD ROOM ,NO VIEW OF THE SEA,Only the Taxi cabs & the Entrance to the Royal,It Was Very small with low cielings,Poor Quality. The Second Room was a Juniour suite as shown in there Publicity Pictures Room 342, You get a half view of the Sea but the main view is of the Royal,But you do get a large Balcony,This is the Room we Chose ,we signed for the room As Normal when Checking in,ONLY THEN WE WERE TOLD WE HAD TO PAY ANOTHER $632.00.u:s. We explained we had already upgraded the desk Staff(Salesmen) agreed we had, & agreed it would be sorted out & not to worry,we asked to check our Room charge due to a water sport (jetskis),We were told we had to pay Not Only $65 for the jet ski They Also asked for the $632.00 for an upgrde to a junior suite,We Refused to pay we were threatened with intervention from the police ,our rep was now no longer bilingual as were the front desk they seem to no Comprendo,to cut short ,we moved hotel Riu Cancun (Brilliant),But it cost us \u00a3300 for an upgrade we had already paid ,Also \u00a3280.00 for the room at the Riu Cancun & $65.00 for a transfer ,Ripped Off ,not only us but also Another Couple staying at the same time because they were not given there upraded room although they had paid in full as we had done.BEWARE THEY ARE SHARKS & THE REPS NO IT GOES ON!!!!!! Totally spolit our Holiday, Never Again would we stay in a Real Resort especially this ONE. We were sold this hotel by the reviews on Trip Advisor as well as our Agents ,These reviews are not a true flavour of this hotel,we thought how good the reviews were it must be a safe Bet how wrong we were to assume ,The Reviews are in our opinion not a true reflection of this hotel. Yes it went wrong for ourselves as well as another couple ,also a a couple on Honeymoon ,it seems The Hotel Staff(salesmen) are on commission to sell the rooms at whatever cost this was confirmed when we officially complained by our Manager Rep > Take from this what you will the hotel is good for a week at most after that you will need to look else where,This Holiday cost us \u00a34,300 so i would say Riu Cancun For alot less with better service better Food Better staff allround .

There isn't a corridor or hall that didn't have a wonderful view. The restaurants would have been our preferred choice, to be part of the all-inclusive plan was fantastic.

We are in our late fifties and do no less than 3 foreign holidays a year, we are not fussy people but we like value for money and our expectations are to receive what we pay for but not prudes. We like to dress up in the evening to compliment the standard of meal we are hoping for but enough about us. Throughout the 2 weeks the down sides we experianced were as follows: We flew from Newcastle to Manchester for fuel. This added an extra 2+ hours flying time. 3 hours before the flight and 3 1/2 hours at Cancun Airport going through imigration, bagage collection and Customs, A further 1 hour to the hotel all added to a very trying journey all in all about 22 hours from Newcastle to the Hotel. We had 2 double beds in our room which is good if you fall out with the missus but takes up a chunk of your living space, this would have proved better if there was one double bed and chairs and a small coffee table and not a second bed. e booked in and was immediately confronted with the receptionist pushing us to upgrade, we did'nt and gladly so as our room was absolutely fine, comfortable, clean and cool and in a quiet part of the hotel so we were never disturbed during the night. I found the Thomsons excursions very expensive but most enjoyable. That is about the only negative thing we can say about our holiday. The food, the facilities, the location to the beach and local shops were spot on. A visit or two to the Hotels Mexican and Italian Resaurants are highly recommended, the service, presenation of food are highly commendable, in addition you have the Beach Food Bar, the Main Restaurant. the 24 hour snack bar and the Sushi Bar on 3rd floor all provide quality food and service. The service we received throughout by the waiters, Hotel Staff, Cleaners can onlyu be described as a humbling experiance, they really go out of thier way to ensure you receive a proper service and always with a smile, each and every one of them wins a smilling badge from us. Thje beach was excellent and we spent a lot of time sunbathing and sea swimming, there was plenty of sunbeds and some with shade frames round them. There is always a barman/lady close at hand to feed you a cold drink of your choice while you are sunbathing. The sea was warm and delightful. I have heard people making grunts about the sandbags on the forward edge of the beach, this is just to prevent sand corrosion and was not an issue for us. The area is charasmatic and is shared with the local fishermen so you can view thier catch or even go fishing with them for a reasonable rate. The swimmimg pool on the beach appeared to be well ru, pleasantly noisy with lots organised in the terms of games etc. Our preference was the beach for most of it but daily we paid a visit to the Pool on the 3rd floor with the odd visit to the jaccuzi on the roof. Like all holidays you tend to get friendly with certain staff members who always seem to grab ones attention, We would like to say a huge thank you to Fiorencio who provided us with our beach towels every day, he was good fun and an excellent sense of hummour, Filipe from the Sushi Bar is a true professional and pampers you, tom and Joime from the main restaurant were smart, very efficient, good fun and took the time to make you feel really wanted. They all made our holiday special. The cleaner whom we seldom saw or heard cleaned our room and left it immaculate with the nice towel designs. Would I go back.

The check-in was efficient, they got the bags to our room quickly and even though we were at the back of the hotel, it was easy to navigate. Our room was not large, but sufficient, we booked a standard type of accomodation and there were mattress pads on the beds as many hotels in Mexico have hard beds. We appreciated this. The walk-in shower was nice and the variety of TV channels and VCR was an added bonus. One you usually do not receive in a standard room. Although not all rooms have private balconies, every room have a common wide balcony separated with wrought irorn and has 2 large chairs and a table if you wanted to sit out side. The windows also gave you a choice of sun/no sun, another nice touch. The housekeeping service was very impressive. Spotless! I left a tip every day and it was not touched until I realized there was a special envelope for such a thing. This made me put some trust in the hotel staff..nice to have in Mexico. Now the food. Wonderful buffet breakfast and lunch and several waiters to bring you whatever you needed. For the dinner times, one restaurant did not require reservations but every night rotated its menu. The service and food was 5 star. Unreal!!! The busiest eatery was the glamourous Italian restaurant and once again the food and service was terrific. The beach was nice but a little rocky, although nice for snorkelling . If you wanted to walk down 300 hundred yards you could swim way out. The beachside service was excellant as well.

I was concerned about some of the bad comments about the food and service. I was shocked on how wrong this was. For anyone to say this resort, the food, the place, service and hotel was bad really either has not traveled anywhere in the world or has standards that are not believable or obtainable (basically will never be happy with anything). First, I have been to many places. All around the US in major cities (San Fran, NYC, Chicago, LA, San Diego, Miami) as well as exotic places like St. John Virgin Islands, Belize, Costa Rica, Hawaii, Punta Cana, Greece, Spain, Holland, London and Turks and Caicos. Also, traveled to Mexico many times (Puerto Vallarta, Cabo San Lucas and Cancun). By far, this has been one of the best places I have ever been to. The food was excellent. I went with 7 other friends for my birthday and everyone was happy with the food. We ate breakfast at the buffet every morning being greeted with a wonderful waiter each time. There are two restaurants for dinner (we all wanted to be waited on). Both Mexican and Italian were amazing. People stated the Mexican was worse than Italian. I think it was the opposite. The Mexican place changed their menu every night and we ate their 3 times and were wowed each time. The Italian was good as well. Very classy and service was amazing. We didn't try the buffet for dinner, but it looked great (just a bit hot in the place with all of the hot entrees). Service was amazing. Staff was amazing. Pablo and Jesus on the beach were amazing. Pablo worked his butt off each time. I would recommend tipping all waiters (gave $20.00 each day to the staff at the beach). We didn't even go to the pool which was really nice. People said the pool was small in reviews, it seemed fine to me. Ana also was amazing at waiting on the beach. Other servers who were great were Mari and Jose. Maid service was amazing. The maids did a special treat of animal shapes each night and did a special one on my bday. They asked when I check in why I was hear and notated my room. I was shocked to see a huge cake made out of towels and fresh flowers on the bed. Tip the maids, they deserve it. I recommend upgrading to a beach view (only costed 150.00 for 5 nights-cheaper than online at time of check in). We stayed in rooms 237/235. Great views and quiet. We also brought plastic drink cups that made our drinks bigger and didn't melt faster. They had no problem filling them up. I would also recommend bringing inflatable floats b/c the ocean is so smooth and no waves. Only recommendations I would say would be to improve the wifi (free at hotel but slow, more restaurant choices with waiters, beds are a bit hard, better drainage for the bathrooms, filled up a bite due to the hotel being older and larger beach area with less boats. First time in Playa and in love with the city. Recommend going to the Glass Door for dinner (did it for my bday) amazing food (went off the resort and ate). Bars off the resort are amazing also (Fusion was great). Beaches were a bit nicer off the resort but we had no compliants with the seating and cabanas to use. Also, cheaper massages off the resort. 25.00 per hr for a massage. Can't beat that. By far, this was one of the nicest places (people, food, environment) I have ever been too.

Hopefully this one will work. My husband and I returned to \"Our\" resort for the 3rd time. We have gone the last 3 years from Aug 29-Sept 10th. Obviously we love it there. We were greeted at the airport by Lomas (who we requested since they were so good last year). They took us from the airport to the resort and then back when it was time to go home. They were very friendly. We checked in and all the paper work was done in advance with our wrist bands ready to go and the exact room that we wanted. All of the staff is respectful and friendly. Last year we went every night at 6 to our favorite restuarant \"il Pescatore\" picture below. We were greeted by name and sat at the same table. We did the exact same thing this year and it was amazing. We were treated like royalty by Mateo, Isrial,Jorge,Pepe,Edgar,Delia, Arturo and Amador. I hope I am not leaving anyone out. The last night we were there it was amazing. Our table was the only ones with flowers and a special wine holder. We were waited on hand and foot but still allowing us privacy. We had a picture with us from last year of Mateo and my husband. We showed it to him and he looked surprised in a happy way that we cared enough to take a picture with him. We did it again this year (picture attached). I would say that I was not expecting so many kids there since last year there wasn't. It was unfortunate that there were a couple boys around 10 that their parents were not paying attention to and the boys were pretty disrespectful to the adults with splashing, etc. There was also alot of seaweed and smell but that is not the resorts fault. The service around the pool wasn't as good as last year but it was still nice. It was a little hard to sleep past 8am since they were doing repair work the whole time we were there right down the hall, but I guess it needs to be done to keep the upkeep. If we are able to afford the upgrade we will definetly go again next year and request the same room. We like to think of it as \"Our little hideaway\" from the rest of the world. We were thinking about checking out the sister resort across the street since it is adults only but we know what to expect at \"ours\" that we may just take a chance that kids won't take over the pool if we are able to go next year.:-) I think besides the room we love the Italian Resturant was our highlight.

The staff is wonderful- they would bend over backwards to help you- if you were waiting for them and walked away, they would come find you to follow up! Aaron the bell boy and Isidro Jesus of room service were awesome! It is an older resort, and the wear is evident, but it is VERY clean- they do a great job. Sheets & towels were always clean- even towel animals made on the bed every day! The rooms are beautiful and spacious- the bathroom was large- the shower was so big it didn't need a door!!! We had an ocean front room- the view is WELL worth the upgrade from ocean view. The mini bar in the room is included with the all inclusive package, and we called room service to refill our beer- they would bring it right to the room as we hung out and enjoyed the view. The $20 local snorkel trip is worth it. Now for the \"needs improvement\" areas: The beach is beautiful & in a great location, but the exposed sandbags really did take a lot away from the view, espcially when you walked down the beach to see other properties. The food in the sit down restaurants was good, the buffet was ok (although the same everyday) and the girll was bad. The best food we found was roomservice- just make sure you call early because it can take about 30 minutes. Good in the morning for a pot of coffee while you get ready. The only places in the resort with A/C are the rooms and the 24 hour coffee bar. It is very hot in August in Mexico! It would have been nice to have A/C in the restaurants. The pools close at 9 and the swim up bar closes at 5:00!!! So, not much of a night life at the resort.

With that said, we weren't disappointed with our choice to stay here. After acquiring the nicknames, \"California\" and \"El Capitan\", my husband and I knew we'd be treated right! We found a perfect balance of relaxation and fun. In the mornings, we looked forward reading the daily activity board....our favorites were the bike tour (takes you up to Playacar and back, it ended up being just the four of us w/ Alejandro), water aerobics (the most fun we've had in a pool, especially if Chicken leads the class!), pilates/yoga outdoors at the sand (doesn't get much better than that!), Kayak tour with Armando and bocce ball on the sand (again, w/ Alejandro). The great thing about the sports & entertainment is that it's there if you want it, and there's something different offered all day long. Otherwise, peacefully basking in the sun can pass the time just as well! Our room was a Gran Junior Suite Beachfront Walkout. Access to the sand is literally right out the slider door.

The built-in liquor cabinet was cool, but honestly, we didn't tap it for too much since all of our drinks were being served to us on the beach! The value of staying in the beach front walk out is not having to go back through the hotel, or up an elevator to your room. It's worth every penny! Occasionally someone would walk along the pathway to another room, but we weren't bothered by that since we spent all of our time outside the room. These suites also come with a designated cabana, only for your use. Similar to a double bed, it offered curtains for privacy and constant beverage service from one of the many amazing servers. We don't have any complaints about any of the restaurants. Our meals were delicious and they did a great job at offering a variety of cuisine. Some may grow tired of the same routine that an all-inclusive can have,...my suggestion is to make it a point to try different things at each meal, which may add the variety your looking for. Our room category got us privileges to a few of the restaurants at the Royal, which was nice. The beach was beautiful, but isn't every Caribbean beach beautiful? There is a sand volleyball net and a great stretch of beach to walk or run along. We also noticed how clean the beaches were in front of the Gran Porto and the Royal. Hotel security was present at all times, walking the beach, cabanas, lounge areas, and a lifeguard as well. It was very nice to be so close to the 5th Avenue shopping. We went back several times simply because we didn't cover everything in just one visit. The nice thing about the Gran Porto's location is that shopping is only about a block away, and we felt comfortable letting our daughters walk to and from on their own. The staff went above and beyond to make the stay as enjoyable as possible. Jesus and Jose never let your cup run empty. After a day or two, Jesus knew our beverages of choice, so thirst was never a concern. El Capitan sends an extra thank you to Jesus!! Alejandro, Armando and Chicken get an A+ on the sports & entertainment. Thank you Alejandro for the great conversations and fun activities. We've never experienced such a complete package of fun and relaxation at a resort before. Nothing was overlooked by the staff, we would love to see them all again during our next visit.", "Date": "August 24, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "MEXICO D.F.", "Title": "\u201cI ENJOY BE THERE.\u201d", "Author": "FLASH1955", "ReviewID": "UR117130070", "Content": "The people in this hotel is the most valuable asset, everyone try always you stay confortable .

There's plenty of nightlife in Playa if one wishes, but it's not as crowded or expensive as staying in Cancun. Playa is also closer to many of the attractions the Mexican Yucatan offers, such as the Mayan ruins of Chichen Itza & Tulum. A pleasant day trip might include a ride on one of the large air-conditioned water ferrys from Playa to the island of Cozumel for shopping & wandering around the large plaza. Gran Porto Real offers very comfortable air-conditioned rooms w/ free wi-fi throughout the facilities. This is a family-friendly resort but speaking as one who travels without children, I was never bothered by them as there are plenty of distractions to keep them busy. The resort includes several well-appointed restaurants, including a full-time interior buffet & a nice exterior lunch buffet by the large pool. Bars are seemingly everywhere w/ a large one overlooking the pool, so no one goes hungry or thirsty. The staff are pleasant, accommodating & most speak very good English.

Why we think you should stay at GPR when going to Playa del Carmen? The location is excellent, near 5th Avenue in downtown Playa del Carmen. The hotel has a very nice atmosphere, being not too big and not too small. Rooms are awesome, but make sure you take a family suite, which is bigger and more convenient. Oceanfront family suites overlook the beach and the ocean: gorgeous, if you are willing to spend the extra money. We felt it was certainly worth the extra money. Food and beverage: excellent service all-day-long. The buffet restaurant serves different buffet themes throughout the week, but if you can't find anything you like you always have the option of ordering something else from the kitchen. Apart from the buffet restaurant you can opt for a-la-carte-dining in the Mexican or Italian restaurant. The entertainment team has a full program every day from 10am to 5pm. Participate if you like, and if you don't that's ok as well. Apart from everything we have mentioned above, what really makes this hotel special is the excellent staff all around the hotel. Truly friendly, always willing to help and and doing their utmost to give you a true vacation feeling. This extends from the reception to all the people responsible for cleaning and from the entertainment staff to to the waiters on the beach, in the restaurants and in the bars. At the risk of forgetting some people we would like to say thank you to a number of people that have contributed to another great vacation for us at GPR. Thank you Samantha for getting us two excellent rooms. Thank you Jos\u00e9, Pablo, Yuliana and Jesus for numerous drinks on the beach and nice conversations. Thank you Teresa and Miryam for excellent bar service in the evenings. Thank you Mike, Victor, Caesar, Alejandro, Armando and Rodrigo for entertainment and fun througout the day. Thank you Verlain, Frank, Chucho, May and Florencino for excellent service in the buiffet restaurant. We loved the food and we loved the Mayan coffee... And last but not least: thank you Jos\u00e9, Luis, Gus and Armando. We've spent many nights with you in Il Pescatore and enjoyed it every time.

Our first impressions of the hotel, service and room was WOW!! excellent location, food, staff and hotel.. however, while the junior suite was excellent, when we was allocated a room the following night for the remainder of our stay we wasn't happy with the room, don't get me wrong, great decor, very clean but there was no balcony (2 chairs outside in the area outside of the room) very small and dark also and instead of one double or larger bed there was two beds which weren't quite as big as a double... if this hadnt been our honeymoon, we probably would have been fine with it but when we paid \u00a33500 for the 2 weeks we at least expected a balcony and a bigger room, we've paid less than this on holiday before and had a lot mor from a room for our money. Therefore, we upgraded to The Royal accross the road as there was no more rooms to upgrade to at The Porto Real...having been impressed with The Porto Real as a whole, we didnt think we could be anymore impressed...wrong!!! The Royal was even more impressive, 5 5 star a la carte restaurants all at Michelin Star standard and it blew us away!!!! amazing, however, if you are a family with children then it is an adult only hotel... Overall, I have no complaints about the port real, apart from we expected more from the room for our money.

The buffet restaurant had a couple \"surf and turf\" nights that we did not know about until after the fact. The restaurants and lobby are not air conditioned so around lunch if you want to eat at the buffet you will sweat while eating.

I honestly don't know how anyone can be even slightly negative about this place. Yes they did try to get us to upgrade to the Royal Hotel opposite but I had read about this and only had to say \"no thanks\". Our room which was a junior suite was clean and spacious it might not of been amazing but it was a lovely room. I am glad we upgraded though as some of the standard rooms over looked what looked like the staff accommodation which was a bit unsightly. We returned every day to beautiful towel sculptures and sometimes chocolates. The whole hotel is spotlessly clean with staff working around the clock to keep it this way. The staff are the most helpful I have ever known, nothing was too much trouble and they were continuously smiling. A big thankyou to Aurellio in the roof top cocktail/sushi bar I think we sampled every cocktail there is and more! The food is more than adequate, with plenty of choice in the buffet reataurant, the Italian was really very good (our favourite,) the Mexican was dissapointing. We were really surprised that the drinks were not just local ones, they were all branded (you know the real stuff) which is very unusual for an all inclusive. I have to mention the 24 hour room we renamed this room\"The Best Room In The World\", as it had everything you could wish for. It was stocked with food which was changed on a regular basis including fresh fruit, Pastries, sandwiches, hors d'ovres and tortillas to name but a few, and you could help yourself to any drinks including beer on draught and sparkling wine, at any time of the day or night. The beach was beautiful, pure white sands and palm trees, sun beds a plenty and no need to get up early to reserve one. The sand stays cool all day and there is a lovely breeze if you sit near the beach bar at the far end near the Royal Hotel. The only slight problem was some noise in the corridors in the mornings.

In this case he had the option of doing something he enjoyed just to rest a while from the hot sun and as long as he enjoyed himself i didnt mind him cooling off in the teen zone.

Very attentive and if your cup was empty it would be refilled quickly. With my kids sometimes they would need something different and they were very accommodating towards that.

Aware of their upgrade sales tactics, I informed them that I did not want to switch rooms in the middle of my vacation. But even after discussing the situation with a manager, we made no progress and took the \"free upgrade\" and planned to switch the next morning. Surprisingly, we had no problems switching the next morning and happily settled into our third floor Junior Ocean Front Suite. The rest of the vacation was wonderful. A few topics to touch on: Food: The food was fine. Nothing 5 star, but perfectly edible and tasty. Not a ton of selection between the buffet and two restaurants, but enough of a variation where we were happy with staying in the resort to eat all week. A note: the portions at the Italian place were rather small, so order 2 or 3 entrees to get your fill. Pool: The pool was great. A little warm for our taste, but it made relaxing easier. As far as the pool-side waitresses, Theresa was really the only one that continuously came back. We tipped quite generously, but it didn't seem to help. I'd recommend ordering multiple drinks at a time to help pass the time until their next pass. Even though the pool didn't open until 9, you had to be out by 7 or 8 to get a chair; we would drop a towel off on our way to breakfast. Chairs also seemed to open up after 3. WARNING: The pool deck is VERY slippery, so be careful when walking. Speaking of towels, Eduardo was always waiting to hand you the towels with a smile on his face. He took the time to talk to you and we walked away each time with a smile on our face after seeing him. The pool activity staff was LAZY. There was the standard pool volleyball and water aerobics, but otherwise they seemed happy with playing the \"lazy game\" (guess how many beans in a jar or guess how many pages in a book). Nightlife: There was none. The nightly shows started at 8:30 and ended by 9:30. If you wanted more, you had to head onto 5th Ave. Beach: The beach was very nice. We didn't spend much time there, but there were always plenty of chairs and even gazebos available. The walk-out rooms have reserved gazebos with outdoor mattresses, but they didn't seem too comfortable. We preferred the gazebos with the beach chairs. It was a bit sad to see all the exposed sandbags on the beach from the beach erosion, but the water was clear and warm and with minimal waves, it was quite enjoyable to float and relax. Room: We had a Junior Ocean Front Suite on the third floor. We were right over the \"stage\" by the pool, but since the pool closed at 9 and the shows ended by 9:30, there were no noise issues. The bathroom was well stocked, though the soap tray had no drainage holes so the soap sat in water almost the entire week (it's the little things). Guest Services: These guys are amazing. We got to calling their area \"the shark tank\". Don't make eye contact with them unless you want your ear talked off. We managed to avoid them the entire week, though they called the room earlier and earlier each day to try and get us. Luckily we were out for excursions almost every day so all we got were voicemails. They did try to lure me down with the threat of having to sign some government papers. I'd highly recommend avoiding them at all costs. Scuba/Excursions: My GF and I both did a scuba trip through the shop that's set up in the hotel. We actually went to Cozumel for the day and had a wonderful time! The trip was well organized, and while the scuba boat was a bit small, the guides made the day worthwhile. A high recommendation is you're certified, or not (GF took the resort course and went down with an instructor). They also have snorkling, which we heard people raving about. The tour desk on site was also helpful. We booked a \"swim with the dolphins\" tour through them. The only odd thing was it was a cash or cc payment; they couldn't put the tour on your room. Playa del Carmen: The area around the hotel was very nice. 5th Avenue was a 5 minute walk from the hotel and is a nice pedestrian shopping street. There's everything you could want there in terms of shopping and eating. Be aware that a lot of the merchants can be a bit aggressive to try and get you into the store, but a simple \"no gracias\" was enough to get them to back off. We felt very safe walking there at night, and even ventured out early in the morning (6am) to run. We saw plenty of other people running as well.", "Date": "August 15, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Pleasant Hill, California", "Title": "\u201cAmazing hotel, excellent service, perfect location, many more visits to come\u201d", "Author": "Michael O", "ReviewID": "UR116729150", "Content": "We absolutely loved Gran Porto Real Resort and Spa and will definitely be back.

Eduardo, towel counter by pool, very nice and courteous.

We declined the offer as we'd already spent a considerable amount on our holiday! We had a 'junior suite' as this is all that was available when we booked. Quite disappointed as it was no different from normal hotel rooms we've had in other hotels in Mexico. However on the plus side the bed was comfy, air con effective and the shower was good. The room was kept very clean too. There was a lack of storage space for our clothes unfortunately and some of our clothers had to sit on a small table for the fortnight. There were connecting doors to rooms on either side of us so I suppose they couldn't place a chest of drawers in front of these. They could have put one behind the door though instead of the dining table and 2 chairs! The food in the buffet restaurant was not to our taste and while we used it at breakfast time, we only used it twice in the evenings and on the 2nd occasion encountered a cockroach in the middle of the dining room which put us off eating! There are only 2 other restaurants, Italian and Mexican, which are NOT bookable in advance as they're open to the general public. We used the Italian restaurant one night and had to queue for about 10 minutes which wasn't too bad. However the table we were given was outside the main restaurant on the balcony. There was no lighting out here which made reading the menu quite a challenge! When the waiter came to take our order, he produced a torch! We didn't go back there again. The Mexican restaurant was much better and we could see what we were doing there and what we were eating! We ate out one night at Karen's on 5th Avenue where we had a much better experience! The beach also disappointed us as we were encouraged not to move the sun beds too far from their straight lines. It was pretty stoney and rocky in the sea although the water was lovely. Finally it was sometimes a bit of a challenge getting a drink! This depended very much on who was on duty and in the main the staff were very good - polite and trying their best to make sure we enjoyed our holiday.

We noticed that the rooms above were the same type of rooms (junior suite), but a bigger balcony with a nicer view, so we went back in to Richard and asked him if we could be switched, he switched us and it turned out that room was ready...not sure why he didn't just give us that room in the 1st place. So the point is, speak up if you have a concern, because they were more than willing to accomodate us when we asked them to. The ground floor pool is nice, but there are a lot of kids running around everywhere. We preferred to use the pool on the 2nd floor, it's smaller, but it has a pool bar and less kids around. Both pools were extremely warm, like bath water. Their beach is nice and had plenty of seating. We only smelled the sour smell of seaweed if the wind blew a certain way and it only lasted for a couple of seconds. The buffet was O.K., especially for a snack...they had lots to choose from. The Italian place was delicious, but small portions so make sure you order some appetizers, or 2 meals. The Mexican restaurant was pretty good, I'm not a big fan of that type of food so I'm probably not a good judge of that, but I enjoyed it for the most part. All places are not air-conditioned. I found that sitting outside was cooler than being seated inside. Also, during the day they have grilled foods behind the pool on the ground floor...pretty good food! Every single staff member that we came across was exceptionally nice, they are all very hard-working. When you're out at the pool or on the beach, they make sure you have a drink in your hand at all times, water...alcohol...soda, you name it, you got it! The room was nice, we had a junior suite overlooking the street, the only thing that we found to be a little strange was that you had to keep your room key inserted into a slot in order to have your electricity on (all outlets, and lights) so we would walk in the room at night and go to turn a light on and completely forget that we needed to insert the key. The room has an iron and hairdryer in there, along with a safe that we used and had no issues with anyone trying to steal our money, etc. out of our room. My family arrived at The Royal (across the street) on Saturday morning and we already knew this, but it was an inconvenience that we were not able to use the same facilities as they were...therefore, we went over to The Royal on Saturday and asked how much it would cost if we transferred over there. They gave us a VERY good price ($200 extra for 6 days), we had to take it...that way we were still able to come back to Gran Porto and also have the ability to use all of the other sister resorts amenities. We transferred over there on Sunday 7/24/11. The room was bigger, a lot nicer, every room has a jacuzzi, right away we knew we had made a great decision. Although the front desk staff wasn't as friendly as Gran Porto's, the resort was a lot nicer and more elegant than Gran Porto. The Royal is adults only, which made for a much more peaceful vacation. Their beach and pool's were nicer as well. If you have the money, and are able to transfer...I highly suggest you do so. We received a better deal by transferring over than if we had booked directly online, so I would also suggest that you wait until you're there to transfer. 5th Avenue is a block up and it was interesting to say the least, men are begging for you to come in their stores to buy things...just ignore them or say no thanks. They also ask if you want cuban cigars and/or drugs. Very bizarre. If you walk down a little bit more, noone really bothers you anymore. Also, the federales drive around in trucks and stand around all over that area with their machine guns in hand, a little scary at first but then you got used to them. There's a Starbucks on both ends of 5th Avenue, too, which I thought was great. You can haggle with the guys that beg you to come into their store, but you can't haggle too much farther down because those stores are more professional. Another thing, make sure you know what the conversion between pesos and US dollar, etc. is because they will try and trick you into thinking that the price in pesos is really the price in US dollars. Just speak up and say no, it's actually only this much... By the way, they do not serve Corona at the resorts, they have Sol which they think is better tasting down there. They also have Coors Light, but that's about the only other familiar beer I remember seeing. The water that is served, is treated so don't worry about drinking it. Also the mixed drinks aren't that strong so ask for double shots. It's extremely hot and humid in Mexico at this time of year. I packed jeans and a hoodie and I didn't even come close to needed them and I get chilly very easily. It is HOT day and night down there. Bring lots of sunscreen and a hat! Overall, Gran Porto Real was great even though we only stayed there for 2 nights, it was a very nice resort and I would highly recommend this to families going on vacation with their kids. If you're a couple going on vacation without any kids, stay at The Royal Playa del Carmen, across the street. I hope this helps!

Our experience at the Gran Porto was lackluster from the very beginning. CHECK-IN: At check-in, they encourage you to upgrade to their adult-only sister resort (The Royal). It's across the street. I won't touch on this much, but I would say the only reason to book at the Gran Porto is so that you can upgrade to The Royal when you arrive (less expensive than booking The Royal). If you have kids, this is not an option since the Royal is adults-only. We did online check-in to speed up the process, however, that was useless. We arrived into the lobby of organized chaos and the online check-in person was away at lunch and thus we went through the standard check-in process. We arrived prior to the 3pm check-in time and our room was not ready, so the bellboy took our luggage and placed it insecurely at the entrance of the hotel. Once our room was ready, I informed the bellboy who told me me that a colleague of his would be taking it to our room. Two hours later and our luggage was still sitting in the hotel lobby. My wife and I walked up to it, along with many other pieces of luggage and just took it to our room. No questions asked from the staff. ROOM: Having been to the area before, we booked a King Bed Junior Suite (no oceanview). When we arrived at our room we were surprised to find a very small bathroom and all of these category rooms facing the busy and loud Play Del Carmen street. The minibar was empty (only a single beer in it). We requested a quieter room and they obliged. While the room was still noisy from the street, more care was put into it and the room was larger, even though it's the same category. Unfortunate, that such a difference exists for the same price room. The room's amenities were fine, however, one can hardly relax. The room faces the street which has trash pick-up and tour buses constantly stopped early in the morning to pick-up for excursions. We were up by 6am each day because of this. In addition, the housekeeping carts begin at around 7am and you hear every wheel of the cart as it slaps the ceramic tiles. They really need rubber wheels! It also did not help sleeping when the ping pong table is directly outside of your door. DINING: Some of the worst food we ever had on vacation, unless your idea of good food is precooked hamburgers and nachos with bright orange cheese sauce. Albatross, the main buffet style restaurant served breakfast, lunch and dinner. Breakfast was acceptable with make-to-order omelets, pancakes, french toast and waffles, as well as a good variety of juices. Albatross is the only breakfast option. Lunch was hit or miss and sadly the only option at the resort other than the pool bar that served hamburgers, hot dogs and some small pizza slices. Dinner could be had in Albatross, Pescatore or Maria's. Pescatore and Maria's had very attentive service and tried very hard to go out of their way to accommodate our requests, however, the service could do very little to hide the fact that they were cooking on a budget. Shrimp were about the size of a quarter, steaks were an 1/8 of an inch thick and the menu did not change throughout the week, nor were their any specials available. None of the restaurants were air conditioned making most meals uncomfortable. Room service ends at 10pm and the 24/7 lounge is the only air-conditioned area in the resort other than your hotel room. It provides a television, light snacks, a soda fountain and coffee machine. AMENITIES: We spent most of our time pool or beach side which was absolutely gorgeous. No complaints about the beach area and while the pool was nice, the resort does not have enough pool-side lounge chairs. This resulted in lounge chairs being reserved in the wee hours of the morning. The resort has only two pools, one near the beach and one on the third floor of the hotel just for adults. Only the small adult-only pool had a swim-up bar and sadly the two times we went up to the pool, it was closed (middle of the day). Also, unfortunate, the resort pools close at 9pm for cleaning. Far to early. Other than the pool and the beach, this resort does not have any other open areas to be entertained -- and the only air-conditioned area is the 24/7 lounge. SUMMARY: The resort is in the heart of Playa Del Carmen, just outside of the pedestrian-only fifth avenue. If you're looking for a city-like vacation environment, than consider Cancun or stay next door at The Royal if you have no kids (we stayed one night). If you're looking for a tranquil escape for you and your family, then consider any of the many resorts on the Riviera Maya, but do not stay at the Gran Porto unless you would like to be disappointed.", "Date": "July 29, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Laredo, TX", "Title": "\u201cDon't Miss It !\u201d", "Author": "Laredo_TXBolovan", "ReviewID": "UR115932967", "Content": "The staff was great.

Previously we stayed in a small hotel on the beach with breakfast only. GPR is a completely different experience. The hotel is ok, but we agreed that we would much rather do a B&B again.. We enjoy eating authentic food in different restaurants and cozy atmosphere. Anyway, this time we went for an AI mainly because we wanted to spend as little as possible and there is no secret that AI's work out a lot cheaper. We still went out for food few times as we were getting a little tired of the food at GPR. We found the food to be good overall, but not excellent. Buffet selection was good, Italian restaurant had nice steaks, mexican was ok, but everything we had there seemed to be over salted. Drinks are not the best, far too sweet, to much grenadine in all of them. We always asked them to make a sour drink for us and we found Clementine to be the least sweet. Mojitos were also usually ok. In terms of the rooms, we stayed in a junior suite and it is important to mention that not all junior suites are the same. The ones in the newer part of the building are a lot nicer than those in the old part. We actually changed rooms twice.. The first room was the nicest but it had two double beds and we wanted a king size bed. The second room was in the old part, on the ground floor. It wasn't as nice as the first one but had a king size bed. Unfortunately we had to change it as well as there was damp on the ceiling and unbearable smell which we hoped would go away as we left the balcony open overnight, but it didn't. The third room was again in the old part, but on the first floor, it was not the greatest room, but we decided to stay in it as we didn't want to moan and keep moving rooms. In the end we realised that the first one we had was the best of all three and actually regretted that we didn't stay in it. The biggest problem in this hotel in our opinion is noise. You can hear everything there, so it is not good for light sleepers. Overall, the hotel is ok, staff is nice, nobody ever bothered us,nobody was trying to sell us anything, nobody was trying to make us upgrade to the Royal. The beach is ok, however not great for swimming as there are lots of rocks in the water. The location is great. Overall, we would probably not return... Big hotels are simply nor us, too noisy, too busy, food- no matter how varied gets boring after a while.

NO problems! ~ Free WiFi... was able to use my iPad just about everywhere ~ fast and friendly room service, will bring anything you ask for ~ great family resort Negatives ~ Check in - they didn't have our room available the first night, so we got pushed from Jr. Suites to a standard room - the standard rooms were tiny and unimpressive. ~ Sandbags on the beach, although it didn't bother us much, the beach is still beautiful ~ Main pool gets slightly crowded, but not that bad ~ Forget the sushi bar... it is sitting in the sun most of the day Other items of interest: ~ Teenagers were allowed to drink, although we were there when they got their wristbands, so they were supervised by us. ~ Great spa, but expensive... can get wonderful massages a short walk away for 1/4 of the price ~ Can easily walk the beach to night clubs ~ plenty of places to parasail and do other things right close by Feel free to email me if you have any other specific questions!

We picked this hotel because it included families and although we weren't taking our children we felt that we liked a relaxed atmosphere and it's always nice to see families enjoying themselves whilst knowing we were having a bit of respite from ours. The other reason we picked it was because of the location....... and it did not disappoint. It is in Playa del Carmen. You can see the beach and the water from the hotel pool! It takes two minutes to walk to 5th Avenue and the shops. On the beachfront are hotels, beach clubs and some shops at the ferry end. There were plenty of fishing boats for hire and beach activities. An ideal location for us as we did not want to be stuck on a resort in the middle of the jungle and have to pay taxi fare to have a stroll in town. Yes, people have said about the sandbags - that is natures fault. People have said about the seaweed - that is natures fault, but people worked hard to clear it. If you walk for two minutes either direction yes the beach is more as you imagine, but people were swimming in front of the hotel and the small fishing boats added character. When we arrived at the hotel we were greeted with a drink. Check in went quick and our room was ready. Yes we were asked if guest services(ie the Real people in the blue shirt could show us about but we declined). We were taken to our room. We had booked a Junior Suite. It was on the ground floor. Have to say the room was fine. Everything worked not a problem and plenty of space for the two of us.In fact we were happy we were on the first floor because if we needed to go back to our room it didn't take long! The service we received was lovely. The people who worked there whenever you went by said hello and there were times in the restaurant that if I tried to tidy up they come over and did it and told me stop I was on holiday!. The maid for our room was excellent. In fact we never saw her and we stayed there a fortnite. She left beautiful towel animals for us. One person who made it for us was Jesus, the pool waiter. He was friendly without being intrusive, refilling our drinks when he saw we were low. We didnt like Maria, Marias the mexican restaurant but enjoyed the Italian. We only went to these once each, the rest of the time we eat in the buffet. yes, there was food we didnt like because of all the spices but the mexicans there did. They do though try hard to have european. They would cook your beef, chicken, steak as you were waiting. Had a beautiful steak.

As for rocks in the water, it's not ideal, but there are plenty of good sandy spots. The depth of the sea is about 3-4 feet deep. As for seaweed, it all depends on the wind. When/if it appears you can walk around it. It's a 3.5 star beach - still very scenic. Kids Club worked out great. Really liked the smaller size of the hotel and location. Unfortunately had Pepsi products, not Coke which we were incorrectly informed of by reservations. T-Zone needs more age appropriate games.

I was asked if I wanted to upgrade and I said no, there was no pressure. One person in our group did upgrade and had to wait about 15 minutes but it was no big deal at all. We did talk to the timeshare people once and politely declined the offer. We were stopped one more time again said no, thanks, joked around some and it was really no big deal. The rocks, sand bags, and boats were also not a big deal. We actually used the snorkel gear and the rocks that were out a little bit made snorkeling interesting. I feel the boats were just a part of the scenery which was just amazing. The service was absolutely amazing. At the pool bar, beach and the restaurants. All of it exceeded my expectation. Salvador and Christopher were wonderful! They worked so hard, were so accomodating and fun. Pablo was our beach server and he was excellent! My experience at the Gran Porto Real exceeded my expectations. All of the service was amazing (housekeeping, restaurants, check-in).

We have no regrets about going, but probably won't be returning, either. In summary: THE GOOD: The food at breakfast and dinner at Maria's (the on site Mexican restaurant) was great. The Italian restaurant's food was so-so, and the A/C was broken, in Mexico, in June...uh. The guys at the beach bar and the tiki bar were wonderful. Quick service, drinks made to order, would bring to your spot on beach or at pool. The room was clean and spacious. The beds were quite confortable, and the showers were great. THE NOT SO GOOD: The swimming at the beach was weak in my opinion. I don't know if it is always like this, but there was a major seaweed problem (literally a foot deep and 12-15 feet to water) which made it next to impossible to get into the water. Once you got in, it is quite rocky. The only option for ocean swimming access was a pier to the right of the hotel, but there were often locals fishing in the same areas where guests were swimming...not good. The main swimming pool was nice, but far from relaxing. There were games with an emcee going on about every 1/2 hour which was very loud and took up most of the smallish pool. There is a \"tranquil pool\" on the rooftop that has a small with a swim-up bar. It was our understanding that this was supposed to be an adult pool......not. It was more like a motel pool from Wildwood NJ got dropped into Mexico. THE UGLY: Lastly, we were told on several occasions that we could go next door to the Royal (their \"sister resort\") to use the pool and get drinks. Could not be farther from the truth. After going over to the Royal's pool bar and ordering a drink, me, my wife and her friend had the luxury of being escorted by security out of the pool area, down the beach, and all the way to the edge of the property. It was a nice walk of shame through the jeering of a few hundred strangers as we were shown off of the property. I honestly didn't care one way or another, but I felt really bad for my wife and her friend.

We stayed from 18th June to 25th June in a standard double room which was more than an adequate size for us both. Upon arrival to the hotel you are asked if you would like to upgrade to a room in the partner hotel over the road at a cost of 60 USD per night - this appears to be a standard practice. Also another member of staff attempts to get you to have a breakfast one morning in the hotel over the road which will then be followed by a promotional talk which one can only assume is related to a timeshare, My only real critical comment of the hotel is due to this as after an 18 hour journey this really is the last thing you want to be hearing about and would rather just get to your room! The hotel really needs to rethink this as all it does is create annoyance as the first impression. However this point aside there are many great things about this hotel. The access to the beach from the rear of the hotel is excellent. The pool area is great with plenty of sun loungers both in this area and on the beach however if you would like a lounger by the pool then you will need to get up very early in the morning. The beach itself is nicer a little further away from the hotel however that is not to say it is not nice where the hotel is. The hotel contains a few places to eat and drink so you will be spoilt for choice. We must mention the tireless efforts of all the staff at the hotel as they never stop. In particular we have to say thanks to Miriam in the lobby bar who worked really hard and helped to enhance everyones holiday. Also we noted the cleanliness level of the hotel is outstanding and the cleaning staff work non stop to keep it this way.

Well, First the good stuff! The hotel staff was great and helped in any way they could with any issue I had. I loved that as they made you feel good as issues that come up and the other good thing was not one person was pushing about money! The overall resort was super clean and always some was cleaning something and really that is a first for me to see them clean so good! The room was very clean and our Maid Landy did a wonderful job of keeping our room spotless! I had money and change laying out and nothing was every messed with. The good thing is that the room had a nice safe for your valuables! Now, for what I call improvements! The food wasn't great and all three restaurants used the same ingredients for their food! So, the food was below average for me and out of of 5 stars I considered it about a 3 star. Really, after my week I didn't want to eat there! The little 24hr snack bar had better food sometimes! The pool was super clean but the music was horrible and they cut out the party atmosphere but they want to be more family friendly. There was only one side of the pool that had music and the other side was totally boring. The activities crew was great and they really have a good time but because everything has been toned down it was kinda boring! No more Tequila Volleyball or crazy games with alcohol! Well, the beach was beautiful and the ocean clean and clear! I recommend this hotel if you have kids or just want to party a little and relax! I didn't see anyone crazy drunk there! Okay, my last is I highly recommend the Mayan Experience Trip with Mika! It goes to Coba the tallest Mayan Temple and they let you climb to the top! Things I recommend to take! Off mosquito Wipes, Factor 50 and Factor 50 Face sunscreen( very Expensive there)! Boca Beach Towel clips to hold your towel to the chair( Right side and get there early!) Gatorade packets, Snorkeling gear, lots of $1 bills for tipping, beach bag, outdoor shoes for trips(Skeechers or Ativas) good sandals(cheap sandals don't work in the jungle areas!, Small first aid kit for cuts! There is a mega mart and Walmart ($5 taxi there!) Expensive if your willing to pay! The Hotel gift shop has kids T-shirt at a good price! Also, 5th avenue was fun but expensive compared to other location. Haggle everywhere! Swinging Hammock chair are $25 no more! I saw alot of people get ripped off.

The housekeeping staff did an outstanding job keeping the rooms clean (white tile floors in a humid enviornment can't be easy to maintain). They also left us fresh flowers and cute little towel animals on our beds (my favorite was the octopus). The entertainment staff was great. Props to Cesar, Chicken (Victor), and Alejandro!! All are very charismatic and approachable. Il Pescatore, the Italian restaurant, was great (I recommend the caprese salad and salmon). We ate there three times and requested our favorite waiters Amador and Daniel each time. They are very attentive with very warm smiles. Hostess Delia is a doll and very accomadating. Pepe and Gustavo were also excellent. Maria's, the Mexican restauant was good too but I was partial to the Italian. We ate at the buffet every day for at least 1 meal. Good variety of food. There is a different theme every night (Mexican, Oriental, Tex Mex, International, etc). Flaming Myan coffees are excellent and quite a show to watch prepared. Ask Ismael or Frank to throw one togther for you. Speaking of Ismael and Frank, they are 2 amazing servers at the buffett. They honestly made our experience special. They both made our family feel as though my family were their only concern. We often kept them at out table longer than we should have getting to know these gentlemen (and them getting to know us). I will truly miss them. The biggest problem we had with this hotel is that the beach is pretty rocky. It is difficult to get it due to the rocks (and watch out for Rock Fish, someone stepped on one while we were there!). The area of the beach that is not rocky has boats docked there so it is difficult to get in and out. Just walk down the beach a bit in either direction and you will eventually find a place without rocks!! Don't forget to book some excursions. We tried the Extreme experience (wonderful), swiming with dolphins and manatees (breathtaking), and Xel-Ha (outstanding). FYI if you go to Xel-Ha don't forget to bring insect repellant!!

Be sure to add this destination. Edgar at Best Day Travel helped us out with our extra activities, and was a pleasure to do business with. The location is excellent, only 2 short blocks to 5th street, where you'll find shopping and clubs to top out the night! The only reason I'm giving it 4 stars instead of 5, is the beach.

The lunch buffet was hit or miss, and we never went to the buffet for dinner. We tried the two a la carte restaurants, they were both fine but nothing special. We had an ocean front junior suite, which was plenty of space for the two of us. The view was lovely; we were facing the Royal and the ocean. The air conditioning worked well, and my only (minor) complaint about the service is that they didn't restock the mini-bar every day. It was very easy to walk downstairs and grab yourself a beer, though, and I'm sure we could have called and asked someone to bring whatever we needed. The service by the pool and beach is excellent. We sat by the beach every day, where there are tons of chairs. People by the pool got a little bit territorial, \"reserving\" chairs by putting towels on them hours before they planned to actually use them. I think this happens at a lot of resorts, though. If you want to enjoy Playa del Carmen, stay right next to the ocean, and have access to free drinks, breakfast, and snacks, I would highly recommend the Gran Porto Real.

The bartenders loved to have fun and make sure to take good care of Pablo -- he works hard walking up and down the beach to get you all the frozen drinks and beer you could dream of! I never had one complaint about any of the staff. Unlike other resorts, Gran Porto Real is in the heart of 5th Avenue - with it's amazing shopping and great nightlife. It was a mere 5 minute walk from the resort to the shops and very busy with tourists and very safe. The drive from the airport was about 30-45 minutes but well worth it! The resort was very clean and so were the rooms. There were staff constantly cleaning and repainting and the housekeeping was impeccable. They not only cleaned the room and scrubbed the floors, but also organized your toiletries. We were in Room 309, which was an oceanview suite. It lived up to it's name as an ocean view, but I would recommend paying the extra couple of bucks to receive the oceanfront as the views are breathtaking. But if you forego and get a standard room or oceanview suite and want to remain central to the resort's amentities, our room was great! Overall, the food was good. The only reason why I just state that it was \"good\" was because of the buffet versus the restaurants. The restaurants (Italian and Mexican) were superb. The service was great; the food was amazing; and the presentation was beautiful. The restaurants offerred a full menu and full bar. The buffet locations were average. Although fresh and well presented, the quality of food was just OK. It was nice to go in from the pool to get a plate or to visit the outside buffet, but it was nothing to write home about. Another great aspect of the food at Gran Porto Real was the free room service. Such a great accommodation and good food, too!! Overall, Gran Porto Real has been the best resort both myself and my friends have been too. We have been to numerous all-inclusive resorts in many locations and this place, by far, surpassed all of them.

Ok: Great resort, you will have a wonderful time if you choose to stay here. After researching the heck out of Playa/Cancun and reading many reviews about the Gran Porto Real here on TripAdvisor, I had a good idea of what to expect. For the most part, all the the raves about this place are absolutely true; as well as two of the negatives. My biggest fear was to show up and go through the check-in fiasco and room shuffle that so many other people went through. To avoid this, I called two days ahead of time to confirm my room (Ocean Front Jr suite) and the number of people (4). Having prepaid the trip through Delta Vacations and receiving verbal confirmation prior to arriving, I felt confident check-in would go smoothly. It didn't! They only had a room with one king which required an hour of waiting before we could check in. The option to switch rooms the next day was possible, but unpacking and repacking to switch rooms is a pain. Their normal procedure is to bring in an extra bed or two, as needed. So, they brought up two twin-sized beds for the kids and put them in the room. We were not happy about this at first, but we got over it and it actually worked out fine since we were not in the room very much anyway. Besides that, the room was awesome. Everything was spotlessly clean not only in the room but throughout the entire resort. The bathroom was really nice and had a BIG shower. The room had an impressive feel with high ceilings, great balcony ocean view (room 256), stone pillars and crown molding/trim. I was a big fan of the liquor dispenser mounted on the wall (rum, tequila, scotch, and vodka). The air conditioning felt like air pumping straight from Antarctica. Daily housekeeping was perfect. The highest marks for the Porto Real are for the staff. Every single server, waiter/waitress, bellhop, cook, maid, receptionist, entertainment director, etc provided top-notch service. A special mention needs to go to the Kids Zone girls. They are fantastic. It might be hard to imagine leaving your kids with strangers in a foreign resort but they were excellent and our kids (aged 5 and 7) loved them and looked forward to various activities, movies, or whatever they had planned for the day. They will even bring food in and feed your kids so you can go have dinner at one of the restaurants if you want (did that twice). Another special high mark goes to the entertainment & sports staff. They made the activities really fun (beach/water volleyball, basketball, bingo, yoga, palates, bingo, bocce, kayaking, scuba demo, etc). My fav activity was a bike tour through downtown Playa to the Playacar Palace. There are a few small ruins to look at and a great beach, along with some sweet private residences in the area. Nightly entertainment is hit/miss, but enjoyable nonetheless. The best show while we were there was an acrobat routine. Very cool. The food was great all-around. We ate twice at the Mexican restaurant and once at the Italian. Both were splendid (side-note: if you read about needing to wear long slacks and no open-toed shoes, ignore it. This must be old dress code info). We ate a lot at the buffet since it was easy with the kids. I wouldn't say I got tired of the food because the variety each day was grand, but I grew a little weary of the setting. We ate at the beach buffet a few times too (burgers/hotdogs/fries/chips/guac) and the sushi bar once. Without kids, the upstairs \"adult\" pool and sushi bar would be a great change of scenery; up another flight of stairs, at the very top of the building, is the hot-tub and 3 hammocks. Go up there at the crack of dawn for picturesque views and peacefulness (before the heat sets in). First impressions of the beach were disappointing. I didn't expect to be amazed after reading the reviews, but hopes were high anyway. Basically the beach is 1/3 rocks/coral, 1/3 sandbags, and 1/3 parking lot for fishing boats. A silver lining to the coral part is being able to check out snorkel gear (free for an hour) which was fun. There's a little sliver of ocean in the middle that's pretty good for swimming, but you need to walk a little north or south to find the best beach. North, across the pier, a little past the Royal is the best place to go. Beautiful beach and water. Although this beach description may scare you off a little, don't let it. The rest of the aspects of this resort are so good they easily made up for it. Keep in mind I'm talking mostly about the beach as far as swimming in the ocean; if your routine is lying out in the sun on powder-white sand and having drinks brought to you, you will not be disappointed.

We were exactly right! Gran Porta Real treats you fantastic, everything from the check in, pool area, beach, food, entertainment, and most importantly the staff was simply the best!!!! We arrived at 1pm, so a bit early for check in, but the staff immediately told us we were welcome for lunch and pool time. While we ate and checked out the hotel, it was already 3pm, so we officially checked in to our Jr. suite. What a beautiful room, perfect size for our family of four. We had a balcony which faced the street, first a bit disappointed but soon realized it was best for our children for naps and bedtime. It would get a bit noisy during the day and nighttime with entertainment. We were right above the lobby in the second floor, truly a perfect location and seconds from the pool and main lobby. We spent all of our time at the pool, restaurants, and kids club. Our first day our kids were entertained by the Kids Clubs Representatives, which were fabulous! Shortly followed by an absolutely amazing nighttime performance!! We definitely looked forward to the show each night, as well as our children. The Kids Clubs became a quick favorite with our kids: Dulce, Georginia, Diana, and Sabina were fantastic, patience, and fun. My husband and I felt completely comfortable with allowing our older daughter to stay with the team during craft time/lunch each day. Each day was organized with new projects group! Our daughter misses them each day! The Sports and Activates group were the best we\u2019ve seen!!! Katrina, Alejandro, Armando, Chicken and Cesar . We had so much fun with you! A special shout out to Alejandro for being so sweet to our family and especially our daughter. She still talks about him each day. What a wonderful asset to your team! The food staff was wonderful. Each entr\u00e9e we had, was delicious. Omelets, Chiliquiles in the morning, fresh fruit served all day, and gourmet meals at night with a large variety. Couldn\u2019t ask for anything more. We often had sushi and guac and chips for lunch, what a treat!! The upscale Mexican and Italian restaurants were fantastic. It was a bit chaotic to completely enjoy with two young children, but we definitely had a wonderful meal and servers. I have to mention we did walk downtown Playa Del Carmen a couple times, we brought a single stroller for the little one, which worked out perfect. Found some good treasures: coffee, jewelry, souvenirs, and very friendly people. We felt very safe everywhere we traveled. We absolutely had a wonderful vacation!!! Definitely will return next year for our vacation and will recommend. We all miss the beautiful ocean, white sand, food, and wonderful staff. Many memories were made, especially by the fantastic photography on the beach!! Thank you Gran Porta Real for the best, most relaxing vacation ever!!! We miss you!!!!! Please feel free to ask any questions!

This was our third trip and we love this resort for many reasons. The people who work at this resort are incredibly hard working individuals. You will never encounter anyone who doesn't appear to enjoy their job which they show by their eagerness and willingness to go out of their way to make your vacation experience the best it can be. A few people that should be recognized are Jose and Theresa who bring drinks around the pool. The reason I remember these two individuals is because of their friendliness and warmth which they extend to everyone. We won't forget them. Dave, the bartender at the lobby bar makes the tastiest Mojitos. We usually ate dinner at the Italian restaurant and several people there must be mentioned. Daniel, Amadour (probably not correctly spelled) and finally Mateo who remembered us from our last visit. We miss you all. This resort will spoil you for breakfast, which could be our favorite meal there. We love to eat a nice breakfast but never have the time to make at home, so it's a real treat, especially the omlettes. We always get the least expensive room, but they are still a joy to wake up to each morning. The location of this resort was the main reason we chose it originally. The proximity to 5th Avenue can't be beat. If you are the type of person who likes to get out, meet new people and see new things, this is the place for you. There are few things about 5th Avenue that some, including my 20 something daughters, find not so pleasant. While walking past shops, there are men standing in front who will attempt to lure you inside to look around. There are some who go a little overboard and can intimidate some. One of my daughters said she just keeps her sunglasses on so they can't make eye contact with you. For myself, being somewhat older, OK quite a bit older, these guys can sometimes make my day. It's all in how you look at it. The Gran Porto Real in Playa del Carmen is a resort that we most likely will return to many times in the years to come.

Granted we only stayed for four days, but it was great. We did upgrade our room, however, to a larger suite. The Jr Suites were very junior. The key to this resort, apart from the very friendly staff, was the location that was right at the beginning of the main street of Playa Del Carmen. So overall, definitely recommend this place. Some positives: our upgraded room was fantastic. The beach was pretty empty, we had most of the seating to ourselves. Most people went to the pool. The restaurants were pretty good. I loved that we didn't have to make a reservation like I've had to do in other resorts. The location was perfect. Right on the beach and right by 5th Ave. If I were to be picky, some negatives; you could never get a seat at the pool. Everyone would save their seat from 7 am in the morning with a towel and then go to the restaurant for breakfast, Silly. The main pool had this large divider in the the middle separating the two sides. That was odd. Also, there was no swim up bar in the main pool, I do enjoy those. There is one at the roof top pool, but its very small and you can't get a seat there either. Their was a Sushi Bar at that roof top pool as well, but I never saw and food there.

Had a bit of a shaky start with reception trying to get us to upgrade. We knew from previous reviews that they would try to persuade us to do this & were prepared but we weren\u2019t prepared for them to be quite so aggressive about it. When we arrived after travelling for almost 18 hours we arrived tired, hot & a little bothered after all the travelling. The lady at check in asked us if we wanted to upgrade to which we said no (we couldn\u2019t afford it) she then proceed to tell us that the standard room we had booked wasn\u2019t up to much \u201cvery small, with small beds & no private balcony \u2013 a bit rubbish actually\u201d she suggested looking at the standard room then looking at the junior suit so we could compare then decide, when we said we really couldn\u2019t afford to upgrade & didn\u2019t have the money she snapped \u201chow do you know you haven\u2019t even asked how much it is\u201d we could see from the price list how much it was. She then stomped off to get our key cards for our \u201crubbish standard room\u201d! Our room number was already written on the card but she crossed this out & wrote another room number on & off we went with the lovely bell boy. When he opened the door it was obvious that it was still occupied or at least not been made up from the previous occupiers, he apologized & asked us to take a seat while he tried to sort it out. It was swelteringly hot & we were a bit peeved by this point & just wanted to get into our room. He came back after a while & was very apologetic & took us to another room on the floor above which was a corner room & this one was ready for us (unbeknown to us at the time it was right next to the cleaners room). It still wasn\u2019t the same room number that had originally been written on our card though - did the reception lady muck us about cause we\u2019d refused to upgrade & gave us the room next to the cleaners cupboard on purpose?? I have my suspicions! This was the only problem we encountered & if you have booked the standard room please don\u2019t worry as it was absolutely fine the only problem was it being next to the cleaners room so it was very noisy from early in the morning with them clattering around with their trolleys etc (we had room 501). The room was plenty big enough \u2013 after all we only wanted to shower change then sleep in there. We did miss our own balcony a bit, there was one but is was out the front along with everyone else\u2019s on the whole floor although having the corner one it was a bit more private. If we had of upgraded we would have had our own but still would have had the same view of the street as the sea view rooms were obviously much more expensive. The shower was amazing \u2013 the best we\u2019ve ever had in a hotel. The beds were quite small just a standard double I\u2019d imagine, there was 2 of them so you could have had one each if you\u2019d wanted to. I\u2019d rather of had 1 big one rather than 2 small ones. The buffet in the hotel was excellent \u2013 especially the breakfasts, amazing omelets made to order, everything you could possibly want \u2013 lovely little mini pastries. For lunch & dinner there was always something cooked to order, chicken, pork beef etc & loads of other stuff & not a chip in sight. All the staff in there were lovely always smiling & Sherly was so lovely, we didn\u2019t have the same waiter each time so can\u2019t remember names but every single one was polite & attentive. The serve yourself food on the beach had burgers, hot dog, chips etc. We didn\u2019t like the Mexican restaurant but it was always busy so probably just us \u2013 think we are too used to the \u201cwestern Mexican food\u201d however the Italian was excellent, we ate there 5 times & every time the food was amazing I loved the seafood Linguine , the staff were so nice & friendly \u2013 a special thanks to Israel who was lovely. The bars were great, our favorite was the pool one which shut at 11pm \u2013 we loved watching them make the cocktails & the staff were so lovely, special hello to Salvador & Avila. We didn\u2019t really bother with the 24 hour bar but the few times we went in there they didn\u2019t have any beer which, had we wanted it, would have been quite annoying but I did notice it was back on again after a few days. The beach/pool waiters were amazing always walking passed seeing if you needed a drink \u2013 Special hello to the lovely Pablo & Jesus. The beach does have a lot of seaweed but of course this isn\u2019t the hotels fault & they were clearing it up most days & it didn\u2019t seem as bad a bit further up. Although we didn\u2019t partake the entertainment at the pool it seemed good, it did get a bit repetitive for us as we were there for 2 weeks & sometimes a bit noisy but if you wanted to get away from it just use the beds at the far end & you won\u2019t really hear anything. The whole hotel is spotlessly clean, there\u2019s always someone sweeping or polishing something, if you see something on the floor then you can guarantee someone will sweep it up a moment later. The rooms were cleaned to a very high standard with some lovely towel art from the maids. The toilets in the hotel & by the pool were always spotless \u2013 they must clean the ones by the pool every half an hour or so as they were always clean! The only grip is that as the hotel is sort of open air so apart from your rooms there isn\u2019t any air con, they have fans to move the air about but coming from not so sunny England I did struggle a bit with the heat. Evening entertainment was fine, not my thing but only on for a short while. 5th Avenue was great, we only went a couple of times but had the best steak we\u2019ve ever eaten in the Argentinean steak house \u2013 highly recommended, We had beers, bread, a starter each & the most expensive steaks on the menu & it came to \u00a360 which for a meal like that is very reasonable. Every single member of staff (except who checked us in!) should be congratulated as there are so friendly & so lovely, always smiling & giving you a cheery Hola! Never once did they look grumpy or unhappy in their work, they really made the holiday something special.

The rooms are always clean and very spacious. Although the decor may not be as updated as the newer resorts we didn't mind because we weren't there to stay in the room. The service we received here is amazing, that is why we keep going back to the GP. We have made several friends here from the bellboys to the capitan of the restaurant. Meals are always very good. You can choose from a buffet style restaurant or Italian or Mexican and then they also have a pool side grill and a sushi bar. The pool is divided into 2 sections, one side for activities and the other for swimmers. The activity team here is wonderful, there is never a lack of things going on at the poolside. There is water polo, volleyball, water basketball, other water games and several out of water activities like beach volleyball, horseshoes, bike riding tours etc. The beach and pool have servers that actually bring your drink to you all day! There are shows at night by the pool and you are served drinks there as well. One example of how well we were treated here is that our friend, Eliazar (the capitan of the restaurant), arranged a private dinner for us out on the lawn with candlelight. We had our personal chef (Dioscory) who served our meal one course at a time and it was delicious!! The best I've ever tasted! We were so surprised to receive such a wonderful gift.

Another thing about this resort is that it is located very near 5th avenue shopping strip (walking distance) and also the ferry to Cozumel leaves from there so you can go across I think for $35.

I was there with a group of friends for a wedding. Our group varied in age from toddlers, to grand parents and everyone enjoyed themselves just the same. First I'd like to thank the amazing staff for the fabulous service they provided us. The pool bar staff (Salvador, Avila, and Fabian) always greeted us with a smile, even when it was super busy. They took the time to chat with us, remembered our names and our favorite drinks. Each bar tender took the time to get to know each one of us. We closed the bar every single night and then moved inside to the lobby bar. The lobby bar staff (Dave and Chris) were just as friendly! On the days we speant on the beach we received amazing service from Jose and Jesus! We didnt even have to order our next round because we knew it was on its way. There were also a few ladies serving around the pool, dont remember their names but they were so sweet as well! The entertainment staff also did an amazing job of keeping us entertained and involved, without being annoying. Chicken (Victor) and Armando knew our names from day 1! Each day they would be sure to ask us how things were going and to make sure we were having an amazing time. There were poolside activites each day (volleyball, water polo, spanish lessons, bingo, the \"crazy game\" that changed each day, etc. They also ran a fun water aerobics class. They were so nice and working so hard that we just had to say yes and participate in most activities. For those who didnt want to participate or wanted quiet time, they could go to the other side of the pool divided by a bridge to the pool bar. The beach was the only downside. While there were more beach chairs and beds than they could ever fill, but it just wasnt appealing to sit down there. Every 2 days the seaweed would pile up and the staff would spend a full day clearing it. the beach was eroding so to get down to the water you had to walk over a metre or 2 of sand bags. Then for the next 20 metres the water is up to mid thigh and doesnt get deaper than that. A little further down the beach it gets a bit nicer though. Fortunately it was so great sitting by the pool all day that we didnt really miss the beach. (Dont get me wrong, we did go down there a couple of times throughout the week) They also have free kayaks to take out so it was nice to head out a little further into deaper waters. As for food, there were a few options. The buffet, the Italian restaurant and the Mexican restaurant. All 3 were good options, we always enjoyed our food and it was quick too. The only issue we had was when we dined as a group of 23. They wouldnt take a reservation, but then when we'd show up they had a hard time seating us all together. They often had to run between restaurants to get enough high chairs for the 3 toddlers that were there with us. In the end they always made sure that you were leaving happy. There was also the 24hour bar where you could serve yourself drinks and snacks. The snacks werent always super appetizing to us, but the guys seemed to like the little sandwiches in the middle of the night. The room service was amazing as well! I highly recommend the chicken fajitas (which we orderred multiple times throughout the week). The location was great! Right off of 5th avenue where you could go shopping, out for dinner or drinks, or just a few blocks away out dancing. Gustavo from guest services was so sweet! He offered to meet with us at whatever time we wanted to show us the best places to go. And then he even got us in without paying the cover charge. I flew into Cozumel and took the ferry across to the mainland. The ferry was a little rough but I was alright, and I tend to get sea sick. It was only about $30 round trip. The walk from the ferry pier to the hotel was along 5th avenue (pedestrian road) about 16 blocks and was very safe to walk by myself. The shows seemed to be good, we only watched one of them but we enjoyed it. We stayed in an \"ocean view\" suite. Really our balcony overlooked the Royal hotel next door but if you looked towards the beach you could see the ocean. This wasnt an issue for us though. The room was big and beautiful and the shower was large as well. I suggest trying to get a room with a balcony overlooking the pool. You can watch the show from your balcony each night, order room service for breakfast and enjoy it out on the balcony, etc. All in all we had a fabulous time!

Bar staff : JOSE, SALVADOR, AVILA, FABIAN, CHRIS and my good friend DAVE, you guys are awesome and I will miss you!!! Entertainment: Chicken (VICTOR) and ARMANDO, you made my trip so much fun, so much enthusiasm, I most enjoyed dance lessons by the pool, we should learn more moves!!! and yes SAMANTHA at the front desk, you were very helpful and friendly at check out :) BEACH/POOL: missing a swim up bar but the waiters are really good and are always running to bring you drinks, sometimes they just would bring you a refill without being asked! TERESA and ELIZABETH took good care of us. The beach is nice, but they have to work hard to clear the seaweed away and if you like to go in the ocean a lot, stay at the Royal next door, the beach there is nicer.

The mini bar was always well stocked and the supply of bottled water topped up on a regular basis. The displays made with the towels daily were a delight to see. Right from walking through the door of the Hotel at the start of our holiday and encountering the reception staff we knew we were going to have a good holiday, they were all very friendly, polite and knew thier job well. All of the staff throughout the holiday were great but especially restaurant staff Capitan Eliazar, waiters Jamie and Tom, waitresses in the lobby bar Miriam, Yuliana and Margarita, sports and entertainment rep Cesar, who although we never participated in any activities, made us feel so welcome every day, however we did watch the shows at night and especially enjoyed the Decades show. Cleaners Osvaldo and one who we forget to get the name of, who never stopped working but were so friendly, Chef Jorge, who cooked us a fantastic meal on our last night and a lady who checked us in to the main restaurant for breakfast and lunch every day (who again we forgot to get her name) was always smiling. 5th Avenue shops were good to walk around but don't bother taking a trip to the shop mall as not much there. We used the local ADO buses to get to Tulum and Cancun, great and very cheap and also made our way over to Cozumel on the ferry, which is at the end of 5th Avenue, but a good way to get to it was by walking up the beach.

We can't wait to come back there! From the time we walked in, Richard was amazing and extremely helpful and we were able to upgrade to the Jr Ocean view Suite on the 3rd floor just above the OKI Kid's club, for a price that we could afford, since we were on a tight budget. The view was very nice and the staff was also kind enough to bring us a roll away bed for our son! Thank you so much! Loved it. The Staff at the Gran Porto Real really and truly makes the difference! Poeple like Richard, Mar, Teresa, Ismael,Mora, Jaime, Antonio, Guadalupe, Ciro, Cruz, Dulce, Sabina, Karina, Diana, Nelly, Cesar, Victor, Alejandro, Armando, Julio, Freddie, Benigno and many others, you just cannt find anywhere else. To understand it, you need to meet them! They are uniques!! They are unbeatable!!! I am yet to find people like them, happy friendly and most of all very very professionals. In every possible way. They are just outstanding professionals, of the highest level of customer service and professionalism. They did treat us like we were at home, or even better, they sure made us feel like we were at our second home, our home away from home. Always with a smile on their faces, always happy and ready to help and welcome us! The girls at the Kid's Club were amazing! They have what it takes to entertain a child and at the same time, ensure he/she is safe and enjoying the playtime at the same time they learn and develop. I did notice the quantity of educational material they had and how well they used them. Also, one thing I must mention to you is how clean, or I should say, how spotless the resort is. From the floors inside to the pool, area outside to the sidewalk! Simply clean! Even inside the bird's cage...CLEAN. I did chek and I saw an employee cleaning it. We did walk on our bare feet a few times just to see it, and sure enough, no sand at all on the floors. What really caught our attention was the amount of people cleaning the resort. At some point, there was more people ready to clean than actual \"dirt\" ! And cleanness is the one thing that guest to pay a lot of attention and is a \"deal breaker\", whether to stay on that place or not! The Gran Porto Real is spotless clean, everywhere. Our bathroom was amazing, large, spacious and...clean! Wow... From the time we hear that a certain place is not clean, that's it. Nobody goes there. It the type of risk that no one wants to take. Nobody wants to get sick from a dirty place, right? And the Porto was just spotless clean, even the outside washrooms, were always being cleaned and well maintained by the staff. This is very important. Floors were washed several times throughout the day, every day! Also, the variety of choices at Albatros was very good, please keep it up. We ate there several times, all breakfasts and all lunches and most dinners. Loved it. I must admit that I am a picky person, I just don't eat anything , anywhere. I was happy to find several options for all my meals there and they were all delicious. Very well made, prepared with love. My son also loved the \"Mickey mouse\" pancakes in the mornings. Just perfect. This proves once again, how creative the Staff is, not there just to work, but to entertain, to make sure the person in front of them is enjoying everything and will certainly come back. We did eat at Maria's and Il Pescatore and liked both restaurants very much. Nice atmosphere, nice staff and very good food. Variety is also what they have in mind, since they receive guests from all over the world. I was amazed to see how much they had!!! Also, we really liked all the activities the Resort has for the guests, either indoors or outdoors. Day or night. They were perfect. The pools were also very clean, Ciro was there everyday checking the water and I did ask him a few times how it was. He was always kind to tell me that everything is good and safe. Also, the Security for the Resort is just fabulous. 24/7/365, and everywhere, beach, pools , streets, sidewalks, etc.. They are there and at the same time, discrete! Ensuring we are all safe and enjoying our wonderful time there. *The only thing that bothered us a little bit was the noise at night, from the Band playing on the lobby/bar area, until 11pm. Perhaps the Management could make arrangements for them to play until 10PM since lots of guest do travel with small children and they go to sleep early, like 9pm or or. We did come home missing every single one of them/you! The Staff treated us like family, I am so happy to think of them and I do hope that next time we are there, I can meet them once again. Thank you all very much for keeping this Resort simply the BEST ! PLEASE KEEP UP THE EXCELLENT WORK !!!! Miss you all. We are looking forward to our return!!! As soon as we can!

There are also a Haagen Das and Ben and Jerry's stores nearby on 5th Ave. Travellers Tip: If you want to go to one of the major attraction parks, save some money and take a Colectivo and then pay the entrance fee at the park.

The beds were very comfortable. These are the reasons I would not go back.. There are only 2 resturants and a buffet. We went to the Italian which was good. Did not go to the Mexican because of negative comments from everyone we talked to. The buffet was just so-so..

We actually ate dinner on 5th ave 2 nights (Blue Lobster-excellent- and the Tequilla Barrel) also ate lunch at Wicky's one afternoon. Relaxing- right on the beach. Nice They do not have enough umbrellas at the pool. I counted - for about 40 chairs (about half the pool) they had 7 umbrellas.. The last day there they brought out 3 more.. Why did they wait?? It was hot and people were complaining. I had to get up at 6AM every morning to play the towel game or else we would not of had an umbrella which you need in that heat. Beach is no problem.. lots of chairs and umbrellas. As others have posted the beach right in front of the resort in not good. There are many fishing boats tied up that when you walk down by the water you have to be very careful not to trip. Once past the boats the beach is beautiful. The property itself is not very large.. when out by the pool it was very close quarters. It's mainly a hotel on the beach.

I have to say that pulling up to the hotel, having the valet immediately take your bags and escort you to the reception desk was great, but . . . having the cocktail waitress there taking our drink order before we've even checked in was AWSOME!! This is a nice hotel with a fantastic staff. The room was OK, it was the Jr. Suite, it wasn't really very big, but who cares we hardly spent any time in there anyways. The beds and pillows were comfortable. The only negative about the room is that you can hear a lot of noise from the outside. Bring earplugs. The food was pretty good. For the $ paid we expected ok food but it was quite delicous on many nights. If we didn't like what the buffet served then we went over to one of the two sit down restaurants Porto Real has. We had room service twice. It was great. We actually never ate away from the hotel. The beach side parrilla was my favorite, I can eat ceviche everyday. The drinks were pretty good too. The waitresses at the pool kept them coming. The bartendars were always ready to make what ever you wanted. Make sure to ask for the type of top shelf alcohol for your drink every time you order or you will get a generic. I liked the Mojitos, Cosmos, Appletinis, Mudslides and all the beers were great. I especially liked the 24hour help your selfbar with snacks. You can go there anytime and serve yourself. It's stocked with top shelve alcohol, beer and wine. The wine was decent. Karina the hotel event's coordinator works hard organizing nightly shows and making sure the kids are taken care of in kids club. The shows were pretty good for the size of the hotel. Not to mention it's all included in your hotel stay. The kids club came in very handy. Nelly and the girls in kids club are great. My daughter really liked going there and making arts and crafts, participating in disco night, costume party and movie nights, water ballon fight. The pool was fun. You can hear music if you sit on one end. I have to say I wish that music was played everyday all day long. Some days they had music and you could hardley hear it. They had many contests at the pool they were fun to watch. The entire staff was very friendly. I think that tip is included in your stay but we tipped everyone a couple of dollars here and there. They work hard and make you feel special. On our last night Wednesday 4/27 we had the dinner buffet and we actually were VERY surprised that one of the fry cooks cooking up the meat was rude to my husband when he asked for tortillas. Later when I went to get some meat, he was gone from his station and someone else tried to help me. Thus the 4 stars on service. Everyone else's service was beyond a 5*. We loved being so close to Avenida Quinta. We also had a car rental that the hotel valet parked for us for free. Love this hotel. We will definetly return.

Also we were happy with our room, the variety of food on offer, the position of the hotel which can not be faulted, and the overall cleanliness of the hotel. The only issue I want to raise for the benefit of others seeking a relaxing break is that due to the wedding parties booked in at this hotel, peace and quiet is not always achievable. There are 2 pools at this hotel, the larger pool near the beach with lots of activities on offer, and the 'tranquil' pool on the 3rd floor. Given that we are 2 couples with no children we chose to spend our time around the 'tranquil' pool, especially after a 13 hour flight from the UK. Unfortunately large parties of people celebrating the wedding of their friends/family descended on the 'tranquil' pool and literally 'took over', the alcohol flowed, music was played very loudly and there was no consideration for other guests who also wanted to enjoy their much needed holiday. At one point a security guard was called by a member of staff and guests were asked to turn the music off, but as soon as he left the music was put back on!! This hotel holds many weddings and so this was not a 'one off' situation, therefore I do think the hotel needs to think about how they can manage to meet the needs of ALL its guests. Perhaps a member of staff needs to be around that pool permanently to ensure that noise levels are kept to an acceptable standard for everyone. We made a good friend in Phillippe, the barman at the 'tranquil' pool and we felt so sorry for him, trying to serve large parties of people singled handed who wanted to get as much alcohol down their necks before the bar closed at 4pm.

We have stayed at this resort exclusively since 1998 and discover new and exciting reasons to return every year! We found the snorkeling right off the front of the resort to be teeming with many species of tropical fish,too many to count ! They have snorkel gear free for your use . The beach just to the left across the pier is great for swimming but no fish to see there. We were greeted in the lobby by Julio who is usually the first smiling face we see when our Best Day transfer drops us off (Best Day is arranged for us by US Airways Vacations) never had a delay or problem with their superb service.Julio is just as happy to see us as we are to see him ! Manager Mr.Nicolas Vasquiz always greets us with a warm handshake and hugs, he walks the beach at midday checking with the guests to see that their expectations are being met. Nice touch to have a hands on Manager accessible to the guests. Our Junior Suite was kept clean and tidy as well as decorated daily with flowers and towel art by Guadalupe Chan,she knew our schedule by the second day and when we returned to our room prior to lunch it was always complete. Mini fridge was stocked daily with our favorite Superior Beer too. Edwardo gives us our daily Spanish lesson along with our beach towels every morning ,I should be fluent in Spanish but as long as Migual the bartender at the Trade Winds bar keeps making those delicious/ strong drinks for me all day my memory will continue to fail. Migual is the BEST ! The beach bar/chair/pool service is where The Gran Porto Real shines ! These employees are there ready to serve you without you even asking! Teresa,Jesus,Pablo,Jose are the heart and soul of the resort. Tireless in their efforts to make your vacation relaxing and carefree.Love you guys ! Food ! The main buffet ,Albatros serves a fantastic variety of tasty dishes,the creveche is yummy ! Captain Eliazar's theme nights are like dining around the world ,the shrimp (prawns) were huge ,we are delighted by the culinary differences each night and day. Waiters Jamie,Oscar,Verlaan,Marcelle and greeter Sherly make our meals there a delight.The IL Pescatore and Maria's are delicious as well ,love sitting on the porch watching bands stroll by playing music,so romantic ! The lobby bar is a great place to hang out with bartender David mixing our favorite drinks along with Fabian and Frank who was in training that week. Elizabeth who works the Lobby bar and 24 hour room greats us with smiles every day and ensures we have everything we need, We had 7 nights of pure rest and relaxation ,weather was perfect and the mix of guests from all over the world always makes for fun beach watching. The front desk seems to get a bad rap but we have always found check-in and out to be smooth and seemless ,I use the on-line check-in and they have my bracelet ready to attach ,which brings me to check out ...the saddest 10 minutes of the whole trip .Samantha at the front desk was so understanding as I stood there choking back tears when she cut my bracelet off,she softly said ,\"we will welcome you back again soon.\" YES you will ! If you are thinking about booking a trip to Playa Del Carmen I highly reccommend The Gran Porto Real for a fantastic vacation.

Woo Hoo.!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! The other stand outs in the buffet were: Ismael,Sergio and the best omelets were prepared by Trini.She is a genius with eggs.Each night at the buffet we were seated with one of our favorites who always made sure that our dining experience memorable.Ismael has teh brightest smile for you when you walk in, Sergio makes sure that you have everything you need before you eat. Lisset our housekeeper was so adorable I wanted to bring her home in my suitcase.The rooms were spotless and she took great care in making sure that when you returned to your room that everything was neat and orderly.As well as the most awesom etowl art we have ever seen. There is only one word to describe Philip, the bartender at the swim up & sushi bar - AWESOME. Now we had heard stories about the Italian restaurant,but no words describe the food and service here.You will have to come and eat here if you ever make it to Playa del Carmen.Jose was the gentleman who steered us through this culinary delight.He was even patient when one of our party asked teh couple next to us if we could take a picture of thier meal before they ate it. Thanks Pat! We all tried something different, so we were able to sample all the menu.The mini cheesecake- WOW. I think what says it all about this restaurant is that people who were not guests at the resort were lining up to pay for the experience. On a side note, Jose was extremely attentive without being intrusive. We have only been back for two weeks and are already starting to look for another deal to come back next year. At the start of this review they ask you to grade the different standards..the only reason we gave it 3 out 5 for value ..is because although you definately get the start treatment, we could not of afforded to pay the regualr price.

I get the sense that none of the kids were bored. The rooms are top notch, and the food is also excellent, although not quite as good as the food at the Royal.

A short walk to the north along the beach and it is totally free of coral for a better swimming experience. The staff throughout the hotel VERY accommodating.

One couple were only there two nights and spent them in different rooms. For myself, I never book oceanview or oceanfront rooms as I know I am never in my room while traveling in Mexico, except to sleep. One other caveat and this is true for most places in Mexico: the timeshare people are all over if you don't make it clear that nothing they could offer you could tempt you to be distsracted from one minute of your time in such a beautiful place Overall this place totally rocks and if you don't have \"the time of your life\", it's gotta be your own fault!!", "Date": "April 26, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Reading, Pennsylvania", "Title": "\u201cGran Porto Real Exceeded our expectations, we did not want to leave...\u201d", "Author": "jmlile", "ReviewID": "UR105491447", "Content": "Our stay was more than we expected, the room we booked was a jr suite ocean view.

We book the trip with another couple through Expedia, based on reviews from Trip Advisor. We made the right decision with out a doubt. The incredible hospitality and good nature of the native people started from the moment we arrived at the airport in Cancun and met our transportation (provided by \"Best Day\"). Upon arrival to the resort we were pleasantly greeted with a refreshing cocktail in the lobby and by the bell boy and front desk. We booked a standard room with the all inclusive package, which was the only way to go. After a semi breif introduction by one of the customer greeting staff we were shown to our rooms. This would be the ONLY dissapointing moment of our stay. We ended up with the rooms 292-296 which are equivalant to an interior stateroom on a cruise ship. The rooms themselves were as nice as the others, just no balcony or view of any kind. We spent the first night there and in the morning spoke with the manager at the front desk about a different room. I did not ask for an upgrade but just a room that at least opened to the outdoors. The manager checked the availability of the other rooms and found two other rooms almost next to each other and had us moved in no time. These rooms were great. They had a front patio with two chairs and a table outside each room and the balcony / hallway that overlooked the pool with the swim up bar. These were rooms 502 - 530ish. The room itself was no suite, two queen beds, but very clean and the bed was very comfortable. That was when we started to be really impressed by their customer service. As we found out the rest of the week, it would never stop. Every single employee we encountered at the resort was exceptionally friendly and genuinely conserned with our happiness. Our beach / pool side waiter, Jose, was awesome. Between him and his partner Pablo we were never without a cocktail or water. Jose would even remember what everyone was drinking from the day before. The food at the three main resturaunts was good to excellent. The buffet style resturaunt was good for breakfast and lunch and the beachside lunch was pretty decent too. The Italian resturaunt was our favorite and the Mexican \"Maria's was second runner up. When it came to drinks... top shelf was no problem when you requested it and they have a good selection too. The Beach was nice. I have read some reviews of the beach being to rocky to swim... I dont know what they are talking about. There is one area at the very end of the beach near the large pier about 150 long that is a little rocky, but the rest is pretty nice. The only thing was the fishing and dive boats were all moored in some of this area. That seemed to be the norm almost all the way down to the ferry pier. The town and nightlife was great too. From our room to Fifth st., where all the shopping is, is a short 3 minute stroll. The nightlife starts late for us early risers, 11:00 or so. But once it gets going, WOW it's one big party. We never saw anyone causing problems and all of the personel were very curtious. A walk down the beach after the clubs start kicking is quite an experience to take in too.

Downfalls: the beach isn't great for swimming. Pretty to sit on, but to get in/out of water there are sandbags/coral. The mexican restaurant was not very good, the italian restaurant was good but always had a wait. The public bathrooms, while clean, could use updating. Upsides: pool on 3rd floor with swim up bar was quieter than main pool. Beach bar, with swings was quiet and relaxing and Miguel was on top of keeping yoru drink full. Buffet food was good and always had a variety for lunch. Drinks were delicious! The size of the resort was good.

Granted the people working at the desk do act kind the management that supports them needs to step up and improve their reservation process.

I wanted a quick bite at breakfast and lunch so that I would spend my day in the sun. *Get to the pool early for chairs. I dreaded this, but it all worked out okay. Who wants to sleep last on vacation when you are in Mexico! My husband and I were down at the pool by 7:15 every day - We got our chairs and sat there ALL day! *The beach in front of the hotel is not great - walk down a bit - there are better places to swim. Personally, we enjoyed the pool better just because of the service. *Visit Xel-Ha when you are there. VERY nice place - well worth the $99! Ask in the lobby about arranging the day trip. *DO NOT get fooled at the airport! If you have an arranged shuttle, go straight out to the shuttle area.

This hotel was not too big and not too small... the rooms were larger and more comfortable than any other hotel room I have stayed at.. the air conditioning worked extremely well and the shower was fairly large. Even though, Gran Porto is an all inclusive, they also have room service and the liquor and soda in your room is included, as well. The rooms were always very clean and was always prepared with enough towels and other supplies. The best parts of the hotel are... The Staff (activity staff, waiters, bartenders, cooking staff, and cleaning staff). The Activity Staff including.. Cesar, Karina, Chicken, Alejandro, Armando, Mike and the DJs were extremely professional and made everyone feel welcome. They were always friendly, helpful, and not too mentain funny! They ran creative, entertaining, and fun activities for everyone for all ages. Also, they work wonderful together and as a team! They really made my stay very enjoyable and I would go back just for the activities. The waiters and cooking staff and especially, Eliazar, Joel and Luis (chefs), Ismael, Geovanni, Frank, Lorenzo, Sergrio, Matos, Antonio were very accomodating! Everyday they came to work with a smile on there face and wanting to assist you in anyway possible. One of the people I was traveling with had a peanut allergy so the chef prepared a special meal with no peanuts.. The staff were insistant that if you had any complaints about the food prepared at the buffet that they would cook you whatever you wanted. The waiters and cooking staff were extremely hard working and dedicated to their work. The grounds of the resort were always spotless and well kept.. the cleaning staff was out there first thing in the morning cleaning the grounds. The beach is very clean and beautiful.

I would not rate it as 5 star. It is more like a 3 star. I know it's a bit of an essay, but I wanted to detail what we went through in order to make others aware of what was going on during our stay: We stayed for 2 weeks with First Choice and booked a Junior suite. On arrival we were told our room was not ready, it would be ready the next morning and as compensation we would get 40 US dollars to spend in the gift shop. Fine no problem, we stayed in an upgraded room. The next day we were asked if we wanted to keep this upgraded room, paying extra, or move to another room, we moved. However, in order to receive 40 US dollars compensation we were asked to sign a disclaimer which said we would take no further complaint to the hotel or First Choice about this room change. We signed, fair enough no problem, these things happen. Unfortunately we were put in a room by the lobby and the ping pong table and between the bar closing at midnight and the staff going to work at 5am in the morning - trolleys and all rolling past the room, we were back at reception to change rooms again, this time due to noise and lack of sleep. We were then put in a room which was a lot smaller than the previous suite - the bathroom is not even separate to the bedroom - and not as advertised on the website - we did complain about this, but we took it as at this point we just wanted to get settled - it was now tuesday pm and we arrived sunday pm - we have so far spent 48 hours messing around with rooms. On finally getting on with the holiday we spoke to several other people and it appears that everyone booking a junior suite goes through this whole farce of room changing - we thought we were the only ones at the time - not at all and signing the disclaimer makes me feel like I've been subject to a scam in some way. It's this underhand way of dealing with guests that definately puts this hotel on a back foot. The reception staff are left to fend off the public while managers hide in the back - the longer we were there the more chaos ensued at reception with room changes happening all the time - it appears to be the norm for this hotel. First Choice were apparently not aware of this and our rep was very good at gathering the stories that came to light and we have officially complained in order to try and prevent this from happening to others. It's something I have not come across before. Good points: Rooms were very clean Housekeeping, room service and bar staff were excellent. Reception staff generally good, but one girl completely unhelpful and rude Restaurant service at Marias and Italian excellent Food at Marias and Italian excellent Snack bar at beach excellent 24hr buffet generally ok selection Sushi bar generally ok selection Pool on roof quiet until pm when turns into a party pool for adults with swim up bar (not much shade here until pm) Always found a lounger Good location to go to Cozumel or get bus trips to Tulum Xel-ha, Xcaret etc... Good location for shops and night life Not so Good points: Very noisy round main pool - mainly for kids, not couples relaxing Buffet food at lunch and dinner not great at all - not good selection - not good cuts of meat and overcooked - more veg selection at breakfast than dinner (would have struggled to eat here if it wasn't for beach bar, Marias and Italian) Staff in buffet restaurant not as on the ball, had to ask for everything from coffee to cutlery Beach ok to sit at, but very rough to swim just in front of hotel This hotel especially let itself down due to the room changing and actually trying to get the room we paid for, as advertised on the website. First impressions are important and I feel cheated. Therefore I do not feel this was value for money either.

We had a fantastic vacation. There where eight of us in total four adults and four kids (8,8,6 and 4 in age). The Gran Porto Real is a very kid friendly resort. Let me start with the rooms we decided to go with the Junior suite the rooms where very spacious (I would not go with a standard room to small). The Junior Suite had two queen beds in a very big room with a well stocked fridge daily. We had a nice balcony with seating for four and a hamock for the kids. The Bathroom was very roomy with a huge shower. All in all we where very happy we upgraded to the Junior Suite. The food was very good the buffet changed daily, going to an all inclusive you would think the buffet would be bland and boring the same thing every day. The Gran Porto Real changed up its buffet daily. For dinner they would have a pasta night, a mexican night with tacos, they had asian night with hand made sushi stir fries etc. we had lunch occasionally outside at the beach bar you could find anything from hotdogs for the kids to hamburgers, salads and nachos with salsa. You could also go to the ala carte restaurants, there is an Italian restaurant and a Mexican. I would recomennd the Italian. The good thing about these restaurants is it is walk up no reservtions required. One last note the kids and adults could not get enough ice cream. All the bars where well stocked you name it they could make it. The service was phenomenal theese people work very hard and are always very happy. The resort is very close to shopping, on five ave we walked there every other day for general items and a change of pace. Just three blocks away there is a store called Mega it is a grocery store and department store combined in one it also has a pharmacy if needed (if the kids got to much sun). We found the area very safe. The pool was very nice, but we came here for the ocean. The ocean directly in front of the resort is a little rocky not to bad though, if you walk North of the Ferry pier you will find a very nice sandy beach we spent hours here (no more than a five minute walk). One nice thing about the beach in front of the resort is there are living reefs with an array of fish for snorkeling in about two to three feet of water, the kids loved this they could not get enough of the ocean. One final point the staff treat each and every one of its guests like royalty. No matter who it is they always have a smile on there face and a polite Hola for everyone. The service from all employees from the Gran Porto Real is top notch. The only regret we had as a family was not staying longer.

For us, we were upgraded to an amazing master suite with an ocean view, but only for one night. We couldn't get settled in and the next day had to move to a dungeon room. What a disappointment. The other downside to our move was that we were give a credit to the gift shop. it would have been ok, except the front desk called to remind us of our credit every morning at 8am. Several other guests received these early morning calls and none seemed to happy to be getting them. Maybe a note left by the housekeeper would be a suitable alternative. The food and drinks were ok.

First of all let me say that I am not one of those travelers who is very picky or entitled but when things are very wrong something has to be said. I spent the majority of my trip at another all inclusive resort and it was absolutely amazing...food, room, staff--everything! They were booked for the last 2 days of my trip so my travel agent suggested the Gran Porto Real and from the reviews I thought it would be great. I decided to upgrade (at my travel agents suggestion) to an oceanfront room just for fun for my last two nights of my trip. I arrived early and knew that my room wouldn't be ready and thought no problem I would do a little shopping on 5th avenue. When they took me to my room I was shocked to see the view! It was of the bus stop/street. I immediately went to speak with someone at the front desk and was told that this was in fact ocean front. When I showed her the photo she seemed disinterested. She assured me that they would try to give me an ocean front the next day so I thought ok, I can deal for one night. I woke up the next morning with literally dozens of bites on my knees and thighs and thought uh oh...not bed bugs. When I inquired about the change of room I was promised I was told they were full and there wouldn't be any changes. The next morning, (they day I checked out ) I had dozens more bites on my legs and arms and was miserable. I told the person at check out that they have bed bugs and he said \"oh we'll, check and see\". Now for the food...in a word-yuck. I might not have had such high expectations if I hadn't just come from another all inclusive where they got everything right but wow, it was awful. The pool was too crowded and small also. Overall, you couldn't pay me to come back to this resort. Im not exagerating when I say I paid the same amount of money to stay here as I did secrets capri. If you want a great vacation with great food and be treated wonderfully, book there instead but if you do decide to stay here beware and bring your OFF bug spray cause you'll need it!", "Date": "April 14, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Belleville, Canada", "Title": "\u201cWOW AMAZING HOTEL AMAZING FOOD AMAZING SERVICE\u201d", "Author": "tammyhowlett", "ReviewID": "UR104027298", "Content": "This hotel lived up to and surpassed every expectation we had for our vacation.

I can't say enough good things about this place. It was our first trip to Mexico but not our first all-inclusive. The staff at this place are the best we have ever come accross. It didnt matter if it was someone cleaning the floor to the bartenders, they are all super friendly and can't do enough for you, they are second to none. Honorable mentions go to Pablo (the best beach waiter ever), Jesus, Alejandro (this guy is awesome), Avilla, Mari, Mirium, Jose & Hugo. The location is awesome with walking distance to 5th avenue which is full of shops, outlet stores, restaurants, bars & nightclubs. We went every day and never felt unsafe. It was a nice option for an all inclusive being able to go out whenever you wanted. The bars were great especially the lobby bar with Alejandro & Avilla leading the way, a small tip each day and they looked after you like gold. The resort was a perfect size, not too big but enough amenities. The only thing I could say was that it was hard to get a lounger around the pool, you really had to get up early, the beach however was not a problem, you could go down at any time of day and get a spot. The food was good, like all resorts after a week you are ready for some home cooking but no complaints, the italian restaurant was especially good. Rooftop jacuzzi was good with an amazing view, you had to get your own drinks and take them up from the swim up bar located a level below. I know a lot of the negative reviews are about the beach itself, I am not an ocean swimming kind of guy so it didn't bother me, but the waves were very strong when we were there and the beach front had a lot of sandbags, I guess to reclaim some of the area. Over all there was lots of beach and you could walk for miles as it connected to the adjacent resorts. no complaints from our group about it. We upgraded to a junior suite when we booked with our travel agency, and got it with no problems. Not sure about some of the reviews about the rooms but ours was perfect with nice furnishings and high ceilings. The toilet some days was a little slow but always worked. I guess if you are comparing it to the Encore/Wynn in Las Vegas you may be wanting a little more, but for an all inclusive the junior suite can't be beat. Playa del Carmen is an awesome city to relax in, we had five families with kids ranging from 6 - 18 and always felt safe. If you are a partier you may want to consider Cancun, but if you are a family looking for a great vacation spot you cannot go wrong with this place.

Our group was comprised of 5 adults, 6 kids, aged 11-15, & 2 grandmas - a total of 5 rooms. We had fully researched this hotel and booked last October. For our family of 4 plus 1 grandma, we booked the Gran Master 1 bdrm suite plus a Jr. Ocean front suite - the website says that we could adjoin these 2 rooms to make a 2 bdrm suite. The Gran Master is the top room for the hotel. If you look on the website, this room looks amazing, and to us, worth the extra price. We liked the listed amenities (fully loaded iPod, complimentary cabana on the beach, ability to use the sister resort across the street, etc.) There are only 6 of these rooms at the resort, so we booked one. Again, booked last October. When we are able to get into our rooms at 3pm, we were suprised and shocked at our \"Gran Master\" suite - it was a completely different room than is shown on the website for this class. The room we thought we were getting had 3 balconies, wall of windows looking over the ocean, separate living room, etc. The room we walked into looked over the pool, but a palm tree blocked our view. You could see the ocean past the bar. Our balcony was tiny - not worth sitting on. This room also had a sitting/living room with a worn out couch, chair & table. The bedroom was nothing special - just a bed. Meanwhile, we were told we couldn't get our 2nd room adjoined to this one, but they were 2 rooms down the hall - that was fine. My brother and his 2 children were next to Grandma and our kids. We walked into their room....WOW! Jr. Family Suite with 2 queen beds, bunk beds and a trundle bed. Columns, huge balcony with flowers growing on it - beautiful. These Family Suites were so much nicer than our Gran Master Suite. My husband went down to the desk to find out what happened to the room we were supposed to get. Long, long story short - we were able to move to our requested room in 2 days. The room in the picture is the only ONE that looks that way! There are 2 others with nice views & balconies and then 3 like the one we initially received. The room was amazing & worth the wait. The bad thing was that if my brother and mother wanted to move out of their 2 family suites with us, they would have to have rooms with only a king bed (1 king - 3 people) Another family in our party was given a better room for one night and then they had to move or pay for the upgrade. I think that is the norm - giving a better room for a possible upgrade when you have to move. The truth: 8 Dining options - not even close! There are 3 restaurants (Mexican, Italian & Buffet) plus food at a tiki hut on the beach for lunch each day. The 24 hr self-serve is snacks - sometimes there would be salmon mousse, sometimes corn dogs - mainly snacks & fruit. The website lists \"Gaviotas\" as a pool & beach bar. This is a bar where you can bring the food you found at the Parrillada Grill (the tiki hut with food on 2 sides) and sit at tables. You can not order food from this bar. It is seating for eating. The Trade Winds \"snack bar\" has chips and I saw peanuts. We based our decision on where to vacation this year based on accommodations first, but also, how many restaurants there were in relation to number of rooms. We thought that this would be great - fairly small resort with 8 restaurants - not even close. The \"Health & Sushi Bar\" is hardly that. It's a bar that will make you fresh juice and in the corner is one cart that holds 3 kinds of sushi. Also the \"Teen Club\" - my 13 yr old said \"Teen Club, right. More like a closet!\" It was a dark room with 6 or 8 flat screens on the wall and a video chair for each. The room was probably 6 feet by 20 feet. A closet, not a club. Good things: Chairs - always found one, no problem Drinks - great Wait staff - very attentive Family Jr. Suite - great option for families Mexican Restaurant - great food Omelette station staff Buffet at breakfast Getting our room after 2 days The problem with the room could be solved by telling the truth. There is only one true Gran Master Suite like the photos and floor plan pictured. That should have it's own price and should be able to be rented. If it's full, it's unavailable. Don't charge the same amount for a sub-standard room. The other 5 Gran Master Suites should have lower prices, so you know what you are getting!", "Date": "April 12, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "1", "Sleep Quality": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "London, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cDefinitely not 5*\u201d", "Author": "jules167", "ReviewID": "UR103649513", "Content": "This was definitely not a 5* hotel by any standard.

There are so many reasons, I will try to list as many as possible. The HOTEL is just the right size, not too big or small. It is a beautiful hotel in a hacienda style, with lots of tile, plants, arched doorways etc. It is kept SPOTLESSLY clean. The staff is constantly keeping it maintained. The rooms are beautiful too. We had an oceanfront suite, which was lovely. I think it\u2019s called the Gran Family Suite. It was large and airy with one large balcony with doors onto the balcony from both rooms. It gave us the privacy we needed while traveling with 3 children (8, 6, and 4) The couple we traveled with were in a suite on the 3rd floor and it was even nicer than ours! The KIDS ACTIVITY CENTER was amazing. The girls who work there were fabulous. (Diana, Gina, Nelly and ?? ) My girls WANTED to go in there. The girls were engaged with the children and we could drop them off as needed. They would bring them back out to the pool when they were ready to swim. The first part of the trip we had the kids go into the activity room while we went out to dinner, then we found out the girls babysat in the rooms, so we would have a sitter from 8-11. We would go out to dinner at 8pm often at the Adult resort across the street. LOCATION: It is just a short 5-minute walk to 5th Avenue where there are shops and restaurants etc. It is very safe. The beach was really nice, and the Real Adult only Resort across the street was GREAT. We ate there (with out kids) probably 4 nights. It is very upscale resort. The restaurants there were very nice. Loved that we could take advantage of their amenities. The POOL was the right size for us. They have activities from Yoga at 10 am to water aerobics in the afternoon. The staff works very hard at engaging you in an activity. Eduardo, at the towel desk was friendly and tried to teach me a new word every day. The wait staff at the pool was great too. Pablo was our waiter and he was great! They have a Hobie Cat if you are a sailor and kayaks to use too. The STAFF was great! I felt they were friendly and warm. Honestly, they bent over backwards to make our stay wonderful. From friendly greetings day or night with a smile. The girls painted pottery by the pool. We also went off the hotel to go snorkeling. The hotel arranged this trip, which was safe and fun. I am shocked to read any negative review on this website. Our stay was so wonderful, I can\u2019t believe it\u2019s the same resort!

Alejandro, one of the BEST staff at the GPR, took care of us. we originally had a regular jr. suite, but he upgraded us to the ocean view, which we loved. the suit was VERY spacious, clean and beautiful. we had a few problems with teh shower, however. the cold water would not turn on at all. we called the front desk, and within minutes, someone came up and took care of the porblem. the second problem we enountered on teh 2nd day was that the water from the shower did not go down. we called again, and someone came up very quickly and fixed it. besides those two porblems, we had no other complaints abt our room. housekeeping kept it clean and neat everyday- and did towel art, petals on the bed almost everyday as we did leave her a tip each day. for my husbands birthday, she made him a huge heart with many rose petals on the bed. very nice adn thoughtful. the food at the hotel was very good- especially the italian restaurant. cant rate MARIA's because we ddint get to eat there. the buffet was good- always a great variety. breakfast was very good as well. we enjoyed room service for breakfast the best. everythign was well plated and i noticed the chefs and staff paid attention to details. for our anniversary itself, my husband got us the private romantic dinner, which was out in the gazebo, on the beach and it was just the two of us and our waiter. it was seriusly the best and most romantic dinner experience yet... the food was VERY good, and so was the spraklign wine, and the music. the beach was NOT TO GREAT!! we usually like to go swimmig when we go away- but not this time. it was terribly rocky and hurt a lot. u have to wear water shoes, but still too rocky. but the water was beautiful, and felt so good- too bad we couldn't swim in it or walk into it iwthout getting hurt by the rocks. this is one aspect of the hotel that we HATED. the pools were clean, and clear. we enjoyed lounging on the beach chairs, under the shades, relaxing and smoking cubanos the most. every day we walked out to 5th ave, where we had a great time shopping, walking around and also having Chai and mango lassi at Namaste Chai cafe. we also had coffee and mexican cocoa at Ah Cacao- def try these two cafes. i miss going there :( Also, we had lunch one day at a restaurant on 5th ave, but cant rem the name. outdoor seating, and excellent Mexican dishes. at ngihts, we would watch the resort shows/entertainment, but then we would walk out to 5th ave and go to the bars. we enjoyed teh hooka bar as well on 5th ave. we miss 5th ave the most. we did not use teh spa, but it looked awesome. we did use the gym every day- cute little gym, very clean and well kept. besides teh beach, this is a great hotel, and excellent location. close to everything- clubs, restaurants, cafes, shops etc. We will def come bk in the future with our children, as this resort caters really well to families. the staff were excellent- and we miss Alejandro, sorry we didint get to say bye to him. hope he reads this!!! sorry for any typing errors! - Nadia and Shaindra", "Date": "April 7, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "1", "Sleep Quality": "1", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Cambridge, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cAWFUL\u201d", "Author": "Reece15", "ReviewID": "UR103149933", "Content": "Stayed for a week any longer and I would have come home.

If I can save someone else from wasting their money on this place, I am willing to put in the time to write this to do that ;) If you read other comments on Trip Advisor...the word is getting around on this place. Offering \"room upgrades\" to customers checking in, when our needs have not yet been met, is inexcusable. We had a party of 3, and they stuck us in a King Size Bed room, and offered to bring in a \"bed\" for our 20 year-old daughter. I expected something like a \"cot\". We actually got a \"mattress\" covered in linens, sitting on the floor. After my daughter moped, I offered to sleep on it...there was no way. Had to go down to the front desk and ask for a \"manager\". There must not be a manager there, because they do anything not to get one for you. We talked with many guests experiencing the same issues, and many comments on Trip Advisor state the same thing, so were prepared. Although they offered to switch us to the room we actually booked, with two double beds, we had to wait until the next day. Tuesday morning we saw many guests with their suitcases moving to new rooms and searching the room numbers. Since you can't even get over the lobby threshold without a bell boy grabbing your luggage, it is obvious we are all moving to \"new\" rooms. As yes, we all shared experiences as we walked the halls and traveled in the elevators. The food definitely needs to be evaluated. Food poisoning is unacceptable. The food that is supposed to be hot, is warm. The food that is supposed to be cold... isn't. The fact that the buffet room is virtually \"empty\" at dinner, is a sign that customers are eating elsewhere. The hotel was \"over-booked\"? Where were the guests??? And as a result, the food is not moving fast enough to stay fresh. I might suggest that a member of the staff sample the lunch or dinner buffet. At lunch, you can barely eat in the dining room, because the smell of the seaweed outside the wall is undesirable. They pile it there to ferment, until the dump-truck arrives to haul it away. At an all-inclusive, the food is a big part of the experience. Don't be fooled by \"Caribbean seafood night\" it consisted of unpeeled shrimp, tuna salad on tortilla crackers, and mystery \"whitefish\" being grilled \"sauteed\" while you wait. Or, you can have grilled Calamarii, which was really sauteed, while you wait. Oh, and cold mussels, which were sitting out for a bit, and were luke warm...eeek. The dining room buffet is not air conditioned. If you have more than 4 in your party, you will eat at banquet size tables in the kitchen at the Italian Restaurant., and be prepared to wait...and wait. But you are at least eating food cooked to order, and it is hot. The Mexican restaurant was o.k. But again, the food was at least hot. O.K., on to the food poisoning, My daughter had the chicken, and I had the steak Saturday night at the buffet. The steak and the chicken were cooked on the same grill together, side-by-side. Everyone in our party (we traveled with neighbors) ate something different. And we all had hamburgers at the grill for lunch, so it wasn't lunch. My daughter and I had a very difficult travel day on Sunday. We asked for a late check-out due to our sickness, because our airport shuttle was not due to pick us up until 2:50. I did not think I could sit in the heat without getting more sick. The front desk was not accommodating at all, telling my husband our room was \"promised\" to someone else, and we had to be out by 12:30. Thanks for caring!!! So I guess this is a \"booking\" cycle. I think they have a GREAT location (walking distance to 5th Avenue), despite the seaweed (and smell), and the sound of the bobcat hauling the seaweed away from the beach thru the day, so you cannot even hear the pool music, and the beach lined with sandbags, AND the FOOD POISONING!!!!... our experience just wasn't 5 stars. I'd give it a 2 or 3...at least it was CLEAN...as many of the other reviews state. I did call our Travel agent, and she was totally unaware of the seaweed, bobcat, sandbags, and room issues!

This can create conflict amongst guests and does not make for a fair system. There were some guests that take up more than one chair, and other's that put down their towel only to leave for an excursion. The hotel needs to step in on this matter. The standard room was small and disappointing. The hotel wants you to upgrade at their cost! We requested a king bed and didn't get it. The toilet leaked our entire trip and we needed a towel on the floor for the full 7 days to catch the water. The night entertainment was lacking in creativity and energy. We made a full effort to leave the hotel at night to catch the nightlife in town. Most guests did the same. The friends we arrived with to the hotel required special services which should not have come with any fees or additional charges. They were charged for items to make the hotel wheel chair accessible which we thought was very poor customer service. This left us disappointed in the hotel and their lack of interest in promoting accessibly to all.", "Date": "April 5, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Waterloo, Indiana", "Title": "\u201cWe had a wonderful time!!!\u201d", "Author": "JHinman", "ReviewID": "UR102848721", "Content": "This hotel is beautiful!

We were expecting an hour long ride from airport to hotel, but it was really only 35 minutes. Upon checkin, they did offer us an upgrade to an oceanfront room (we booked an oceanview JS), even offering us a chance to check out the two rooms first, but once we said we weren't upgrading, they didn't push. Everything from that point was awesome. Any one who wrote a negative comment about this hotel must have gone looking for all the negtative, and be EXTREMELY hard people to please. The food was great. We ate at the buffet for all but 4 meals (3 were had on a day-long trip to Ek Balam and one was at the Italian restaurant) and there was always lots to choose from. My favorites were the pasta and carving stations. As for lounge chairs near the pool or beach, it was always much easier to find good chairs by the beach. There isnt much of a beach, and there is a lot of sandbags, but you can still go in the water. Lots of beach on either side of the hotel to walk or put down towels. The service at the main pools bar was sometimes slow, but that's because they would be making drinks for the people on the beach. The most we waited for drinks was 3 minutes. So not a big deal at all! The room we had was 240. Yes, the \"Oceanview\" rooms are only oceanview if you look to the right off your balcony, but we were close enough to the end where we actually had a pretty good view unobstructed by trees. Our fridge was always stocked with extra water and cervezas. The bathrooms are massive. I'd like to have that shower in my own house. The cleaning times were pretty random, but we found that if we requested room cleaning it got done much quicker than not. As for the location, it really doesn't get much better. Being that close to 5th was awesome, and we felt safe all the time, even at night. The only \"bad\" part of staying there was during our trip to Ek Balam (or chichen itza)... We were the first ones picked up (at 7:10am) and the last ones dropped off (at 8:30pm). If you don't mind sitting on a bus for a majority of your day, then go the group route for excursions. If you don't, check prices on cabs and entry fees at the destination and maybe do that. Then you get all the time you want to tour and won't be shuffled all over with a bunch of people. I will say, that seeing the ruins was definitely worth all the time on the bus, just we would do it differently next time.

Not too far away, awesome fish to see, and a great beach to hang out on until it was time to go back to the resort. Both of us couples stayed in the Junior Suites.

The Real Beach club was a little small and far away from the beach. The Gran Porto was quite the upgrade indeed and we checked into a junior suite. The suite was very large and we liked the individuality of the bathroom. The in room bar was a little scary with off brand cheapo booze, but come on, how many drinks were we really going to make for ourselves?! When tipped, the maids make fantastic towel animal art :) The staff here is great. You read so many reviews about how good they are and its all true. They remembver who you are, your drinks, and even your names! Our favorite bartenders were the guys at the beach bar, always smiling and being great servers! Also the beach runners/waitresses always remembered my name, and my drinks. I tipped 20 pesos for 2 drinks most of the time. Its pretty fair to take about $100 on the one week vacation with you and use it as tipping money. These folks dont get paid a ton, you keep it in the country and not giving to rich hotel owners, and they are out working in the heat all day to make your vacation! ALso a good tip for booze is. if you ASK for the brand name they will give it to you.. if you dont ask.. you get local cheap stuff. No problem! We ate at the buffet and the a la cartes a few times, but we mostly just went into town! Resort food is resort food. Its always lack lustre. Its edible, and does the trick, but it wont overwhlem you with its flavor. The best restaurant for us was the Italian 'Il Pescatore' and we had the priviledge of having Luis and Gustavo as our servers. They were amazingly funny and great hosts all around! If you are craving something a little more healthy and a little less buffet-grease... just head to the 3rd floor where there is a smaller non crowded pool, hammocks, and a sushi bar. The sushi is actually really good and we snacked on it almost every day guilt free. With so much to do in town we sure wandered up and down the streets as its very safe and cosmopolitan. Tons of shops (both high end and low end) are all up and down the strip as well as on the side streets. Many different types of cuisine can be sampled on 5th as well. The best restaurant for us wasnt to far down 5th from the hotel. Its name is ' Los Tulipanes' and our waiter both nights was Fernando. He remembered us when we came back and gave us not only the best meals, wine recommendations, but also the best service of the week. I would check out this place for sure! For desert, check out the gelato shops... its lower in fat than icecream and the Hagen Daas and Ben n Jerry stores are VERY expensive considering where you are! The beach right infront of the hotel has some rocks and sandbags, but fret not my friends, just simply walk down the sand in either direction and you have much softer entryways to the beach. You can walk all the way down the beach to the ferry if you wish, seeing many bars and condos on the way that you may patron. Take the ferry to Cozumel just not on Sunday.. eerything closes very early if open at all and there is some great shoping over there as well. We did the runis tour in Tulum and the beach there was fantastic if you like big waves to play in. The ruins were of homesteads as opposed to pyramid style but had some great history and they were close by to the hotel. The other tour we did was Rio Secreto! AMAZING!!! unlike anything you will ever see! The tour guide Andrea is so excited to give the tours! Warnings: DONT go on a tour of the royal if asked.. its a time share presentation and NOT worth it.. it will eat up your monring and they send you through 5 different closers before they let you leave. YIKES! We got a $50 gift card for the gift shop out of it , but in retrospect not worth it. Also this hotel does not have a disco. Some poeple want that, so if you do, there is not one on the property. (however you ARE right in town) In a nut shell, good resort for its proximity to the beach (some room OPEN onto sand), righ tin town, great staff, and a pretty fun vibe.

I can't imagine how he remembered waiting on so many people each day. We also had another great beach server when we sat closer to the pool area Jesu.

I can truely say that we have never stayed at a resort where ALL of the staff is so attentive. Every staff person that walked by us said hello and had a smile on there face. Our staff at the buffet JUAN CAVICH, Amabiael, and Eleazar made the stay even better. Although the buffet got a little boring, we still wanted to go to dinner there because these guys made it fun. Juan was the BEST. The location is great because you are only one block off of 5th Avenue to do shopping. As other reviews state the beach directly in front of the resort is not so great for swimming. If you walk to either side of the resort the beach/swimming is much better. As stated we stayed in the master suites so we had access to the Royal Playa right next door. That is much more upscale which didn't really appeal to us. We ate there 1 night and the food seemed to be better, but like I said we really missed our waiters from the Buffet. We also tryed the Mexican and the Italian restaurants and both were good.

We got a great deal on a week at the Gran Porto Real and booked the trip. We had an awesome week and will for sure make a point to go back to the Riveria Maya and also the Gran Porto Real. The hospitality from all of the people at the hotel and restaurants was amazing. The location is also perfect fit. It is just a block away from 5th Avenue, yet you don't feel like you are crowded by tourists. Although my wife and I went without the kids, we could tell that this hotel was a great place for a family vacation. Obviously we went during the spring break season, but PDC didn't seem to have any of the college aged, frat party atmoshere which was refreshing. The best part of each day for my wife and I was the time in the sun on the beach. The Can brothers (Jesus and Pablo) quickly would pick up on what your specific drink of the day would be and somehow would find a way to have your next beverage to you by the time you finished your last. Miguel was also the best bartender at the hotel and was always quick and efficient. At first the food seemed to be very spotty from looking at some of the buffet areas. But the menu and preparation at the Mexican and Italian restaurants was 1st class and very appetizing and the ala carte entree's at the Albatross (Buffet) were always well done. I learned to stay away from anything that wasn't made fresh and the food always delivered for me. The only negative thing about this hotel was the swimming area on the beach. There are quite a few areas of washout from the tides and many rocks and sandbags to negotiate. The beach was still very good for relaxing and getting sun though. It was also very easy to walk a bit down the beach on either side of the hotel and there was more than enough areas to swim in the ocean. They also stuck us in the worst suite in the building upon arrival, but that was easily fixed by switching to another suite (Without Upgrading) and this was a much better room.

They quickly offered us refreshments after arriving late - our check in was painless, although they did offer us an upgrade - but wasn't pushed on us. We were shown our rooms (Jr. Suites - totally worth the price - nice and large) - the rooms were spotless, and air conditioning was wonderful. We had a lovely balcony that had a view of the ocean. Food and staff always kind and totally at your beck and call. We would go to get things ourselves and they'd beat us to it most of the time. At breakfast there were times when things were forgotten - but not big deal - we just got up and got it ourselves. The staff was amazing. We enjoyed both restaurants and the buffet but the Italian resturant was our favorite - We tried Havana coffee while we were there at the Mexican/Steak restaurant - They were wonderfully entertaining while they made it - You really should at least try them. The beach was just literally out our door. Although there were sandbags under parts of the beach (due to storms and errosion) - if you walked just a little ways down the beach was lovely for walks. Bring water shoes though- the coral and stones can be rough on the feet when in the water - not really bad anywhere - but a very good precaution. Town was literally out the front door. So much to see and do - worth the walk - look for hidden art stores in what you think is a store alley - but it's actually a court yard - and it has new shops. Some of the vendors are a little pushy - but most of them are just friendly - give a bit of an effort to get you into the stores - but if you say no- they smile and just keep on with their conversations! People in Playa were very warm and friendly. We loved Mexico - the trip was amazing - the resort was small enough you could walk it easily - there were two pools (one very kid friendly one with arts centre) and an adult one. The entire resort was very kid friendly with their kids zone. You could get food in their 24 hour cafe - which also provided soft drinks, and other drinks 24 hours a day.

On arrival the room was very basic with a shower that did not work and two single beds overlooking the dustbins, no balcony or sitting area, one very small window in all the room, dark depressing place, we could only stand one night in here, next day upgraded to a junior suite with ocean view at extra cost. Beach was nice staff helpfull. Went back with friends March 2011 the hotel has gone downhill, beach has got smaller, covered in smelly seaweed. On arrival the Junior Suite rooms with sea views ocean front, that we understood we had booked with travel agent, were not what the hotel had us down for, and if we wanted them, then we had to pay an upgrade several hundreds of dollars extra per person, per week. Girl on reception not very helpful. Explained that we had simular problem a few years ago, did not expect this again. We were sent to the sister hotel next door for 2 nights as rooms not ready, the Royal is a far superior hotel and we wpuld have liked to stay there but cost too prohibative. We had paid for junior suites, at Grand Purto Real Hotel, but they say not ocean front. So took juinor suite, ended up with no view. Had 4 rooms before decided to put up with it. First room was near to the kitchens, the noise from the extractor fans from the kitchen was a continuous drone, plus building works, concreate breaker hammers all day, could not sleep day or night. No view at all internal rooms looking at other rooms. Asked for a room change, again they tried to push upgrade for more money. Moved to ground floor 11#, very noisey, overlooking the road, kids screaming and running about in the hotel, trolleys for cleaners ratteling up and down at all hours. Room was for disabled, so wc raised up, on make shift concreate block covered in floor tiles, but a lot bigger than the base of the wc, so it stuck out and when you went to the wc you knocked your toes up on it. Could not get a good nights sleep. Asked for a room change, got another seemed okay, again over looking the road but level 2, before un packing noticed a foul odour of sewer drains. Spoke to reception, they sent a cleaner, she put bleech down the sink, wc and shower, this made no differance, it was not a cleaning problem it was the drains. Complained again, they sent cleaner with a supervisor who put disinfectant down the sink, wc, and shower, and threw bleach all over bedroom floor, and said it was now okay. It made no differance, we asked for maintaninence to find drain problem, they looked and took shower trap off, nothing there, took ceiling vent out and sprayed it with disinfectant and said it was fixed. We could not put up with the smell and sent for them again, they said that we should leave air conditioning FULL and then we would not smell it. We could not put up with the smell so asked to speak to the manager, he offered us another room but said they were fully booked and had to take what ever they had. Gave us one over the front entrance next to the lift shaft, but decided to put up with the noise of the busses and lift as we had spent the first week packing and un packing changing room. The food was okay, but all spicey and sauces, no simple plain food. The quality of the food has gone down from a few years ago, the Italian resturant menue never gets changed. And you have to wait 30 - 60 minutes to get in. The mexican resturauunt was very poor service they take your order and nothing happens for an hour. Bar Staff at hotel very helpful, but not many international drinks, served mainly in plastic tumblers, there is always a shortage of glasses, desert and soup spoons as well. The furniture in the lounge is broken, very worn and in desperate need of replacement, in fact the whole hotel needs refurbishing. The public toilets are VERY SMALL, you struggle to get in them and they quite often do not work, will not flush. Magic eye hand wash basins in public areas, again some do not work, you can report these as broken, but no one does anything about it. My friend found a massive cockroach in her bed. Very noisey in March its the Americans break, young teanagers come down to get drunk as they are not allowed to drink until they are 21 years old in America, so they come down here in big groups to get drunk and run around the hotel all night and early morning shouting and screaming and it echos on the corridors. Staff do nothing about asking them to keep quite. Best thing about this hotel is the location, there are plenty of sun beds and drinks deliverd to the beach. Trips available in the hotel in mini buses max 12 persons. They are better that the ones supplied by the Thompson rep who's trips are on a 56 seater, it takes 2 hours to pick up all customers before you even set off on trip and another 2 hours to drop them off, adds 4 hours to your day. The nightlife / shows at the hotel are very poor. This hotel is not as good as 5 star hotel's we have been in before, we think it would be rated a 3*+ to max 4* Flight time about 12 hours, plus transfer times, the upgrade in flight is worth the additional cost.", "Date": "March 16, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Burlington", "Title": "\u201cGRAN PORTO REAL RESORT & SPA ~ A VERY RARE MAYAN RIVIERA GEM\u201d", "Author": "BurlingtonChica", "ReviewID": "UR100384580", "Content": "\u201cBeyond Expectations\u201d ~ \u201cExpect the Exceptional\u201d ~ these words have never had so much meaning except when describing the Gran Porto Real Resort & Spa, and everyone who makes this incredible Resort so very special.

The best thing about it was that it was done because they are genuinely nice people and did things from their heart not for tips or because someone told them to do it.

We stayed at the Gran Porto Real for the first time for many reason, mainly location and positive feedback on trip advisor. we arrived on thursday 3/3 to be told that the room we had book - an ocean front jr. suite was unavailable and would not be available until the next day. they said they would put us up at their \"sister\" resort. My immiediate thought was at the Royal across the street so we thought that would be fine for one night and they had told us they would upgrade our room to a jr. suite ocean front walkout for our troubles. All sounded great until they said we'll get you a taxi, they weren't sending us to the Royal, but to the Real, about 5 blocks away, Not on the ocean....however, what were we supposed to do, they didn't have a room for us, so we went... OMG the room they gave us at the Real was horrible. it was dated, dirty, the plumbing was questionable and didn't really work well, found an ant in the bed, i was horrified. we left our things and went back to the GPR where they assured us that we had a room the next night with them, so we sucked it up. They did indeed have a room for us on friday afternoon at the GPR and did upgrade as they promised. Samantha at the front desk was amazing through this whole ordeal. She was calm and sweet, even though i wasn't. I know she didn't personally overbook the hotel, but she more than made up for our inconvenience. She was amazing throughout the stay. Now for the good... once we got our room, it was great. comfy bed, well kept, nice location on the beach, the walkout was great. No complaints for the most part. On thursday 3/10 (7 days into our 9 day stay), we went back to our room after lunch to freshen up and the door key didn't work... Samantha to the rescue, fixed it up and no worries. At that point the maid service hadn't been in yet, but no worries... around 2 the maid did show up, stripped the bed, left sheets sitting on the table, took the $2 that i left (i left around $2 every day for her). Anyway, thought this was weird but i know they were checking in a lot of people that day, so i assumed they pulled her away to make up another room for a new guest. I went to the front desk to let them know the room wasn't complete, they said they would send someone right down to finish it. At 5 it wasn't done, we were ready to take a rest and shower and prepare for our evening, so i made the bed. about 530 the maid showed, of course i turned her away, there was no need. so i'm guessing the room they gave us that was an upgrade was technically supposed to go to someone else on 3/10... oh well, no harm. All in all, it was a good stay. nice beach, the people are all amazing.. as mentioned above Samantha at the front desk and miguel at the tradewinds bar. the food was very good, we didn't really stick around in the evenings to see the entertainment, the reason we stay in PDC is so we can go into town in the evenings... so that's what we did! All in all, i would certainly consider going back to this hotel, but admit i would be a skeptical due to our issues at check in. I would need to be reassured that this would never happen again. Thank goodness we did not have our children our my parents with us on this trip, we often to bring them. it would have been disastrous if we had a larger. I also know that we weren't the only ones affected by this booking situation. there were 2 other groups at the Real that were in a similar situation.", "Date": "March 13, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Grand Rapids, Michigan", "Title": "\u201cA little bit of paradise\u201d", "Author": "dkcorrall", "ReviewID": "UR100010505", "Content": "It is not just that the Gran Porto Real and Spa is for the most part excellent, but the location of it cannot be beat.

There were 40 people in our group and from what I hear everyone was pleased with the resort and the ammenities. The service and the cleanliness of this resort were outstanding compared to many other all inclusive resorts we've been to. Our room had an ocean view and although the ocean front rooms had much nicer views, we thought our view was pretty great and it was nice to be able to watch people going up and down the street between our resort and the sister resort. I don't think I would've enjoyed the stay as much if we had a regular junior suite or a standard room though. The food was pretty good especially at the Italian Restaurant! It was nice not having to make reservations for a la cartes! I absolutely loved the breakfasts at the buffet. The ammenities were good, lots to do, the roof top hot tub was a lot of fun. The pool bar and beach were very good as well and we had excellent service from all the bar staff especially Pamela, Pablo and Jesus! Being within walking distance of 5th Ave was convenient for such a big group so that everyone could come and go as they chose. It would've been a bit of a pain if we had to take cabs everytime we left the resort! The wedding itself was amazing and more than we could've even dreamed it would be! Our wedding planner Lilia was fantastic and she made it so that we had very little planning to do. The vows, cocktail reception and reception/dinner/dance were all on the beach and everything was perfect, the staff were amazing. Freddy was my absolute favourite and did such a great job and was awesome with our special requests. He even made sure he memorized everyone's names from the wedding group and would greet us by name when he would see us at the restaurants for the rest of the week. A nice added touch!! I really don't have any negatives to comment on. The top thing that makes this hotel so great in our eyes is the amazing staff the Gran Porto has employeed.

This was the first time to Gran Porto Real for both of us. From check-in to check-out everything was wonderful. We were greeted with beverages while waiting to check-in but check-in at the desk was speedy. The room (326) was spacious and super clean. A great view from the balcony and a nice breeze with morning sun. We had breakfast and dinner at the Albatros. Something for everyone. Breakfast was mostly the same but with a huge variety. Dinners were themed with something different every night. Fresh fruit and salads always. Main courses were fresh with cooks behind the grills, grilling 'to order' dinners. Some lines, but they were quick and efficient. Frank, Ismael and Antonio were just a few waiters we had that were fabulous and again-efficient. Drinks were always filled,(even when only drinking water) never wanted for anything. Spent all of our days on the beach. Jesus was our main 'cabana man'. In observing the area they cover with service, I was amazed that they were able to get to us on such a continuous cycle. Again-efficient. We had Pablo a couple days and had the same service. The snack bar on the beach served the same thing daily, but worked great if you didn't want to leave the sun. Chips, cheese, 'salsa', burgers, dogs and refried beans just to name a few things. Betty made sure our room was always clean and stocked. She even went to the trouble of 'towel critters' with red flower petals on the bed. The ocean was great to swim in. Some seaweed to contend with, but they even have a staff to clean that up. And if ya do have to walk through it, it isn't slimy. Security walked the beach all day and night. I noticed they keep the non-guests moving to avoid loitering. 5th Avenue shopping is just a block away. Safe to walk to and enjoy. We plan a yearly trip and will return to Gran Porto Real for our stay. On a closing note:there was always staff around whether they were cleaning or just available for guest services.

We just arrived home from a 7 day family vacation at the Gran Porto Real and let me say, we have travelled a ton, including MANY all inclusives throughout the Caribbean (Cuba, Dominican, Tobago, Caymans, etc.) and this hotel was extremely safe, clean, and had THE BEST service we have ever had... we'll definitely go back! We booked through Air Canada Vacations and every part of our holiday was seamless, including the transportation provided from the Cancun Airport to Playa Del Carmen and back again. The hotel is in a GREAT location and is only a couple blocks walk from 5th Avenue where you'll find shopping, restaurants, nightlife, etc. When we arrived at the hotel in the early evening, we were greeted with smiles and offered a welcome drink as we checked in. The staff at the front desk were friendly, fast, and efficient --- we need to give a huge thanks to PAUL, the new front desk trainee, who had just started working at the hotel that night and took exceptional care of us for the entire duration of our stay. He's a keeper Lynn! (General Manager) We stayed in a Junior Suite Ocean Front on the 3rd floor and it was well worth it. It was large, comfy, with a King Size bed and a big balcony overlooking the beach and ocean. We could look down to the grounds, pool and entertainment stage to the right, but were far enough away that our room was quiet when our 5 year old son was going to sleep. We called down and requested an extra bed for him, which they set up immediately, so we all slept well. Being on the 3rd floor is much better than the 1st floor as there aren't as many carts rolling by, etc. The bathroom was fabulous with a huge shower, lots of hot water and pressure. And the included bathrobes, slippers, turn down service with chocolates on the pillows, fancy towel art with fresh beautiful flowers left daily for us, a wall cabinet with 4 full bottles (ie. rum, vodka, etc) for top ups any time of day, bottled water provided in the fridge daily, as well as free Internet were all excellent. There is a 4 digit room safe to lock up all valuables as well, so no worries there. As part of a promotion, we received a $50 resort credit to use any way we liked (room, spa, etc.) as well as a bottle of Champagne, flutes, and a plate of fresh fruit which arrived to our room shortly after we checked in. Very nice. What impressed us most about this hotel were the employees and the top notch service we received. We have NEVER stayed at an all inclusive where you look around and see every single employee working hard, very happy, joking, and extremely accommodating. This includes the towel attendant, the bar/pool/beach servers, the lifeguards, the grounds security, all the food and beverage servers --- everyone! They put a HUGE emphasis on customer service and it shows! We found the beach was just fine -- beautiful white sand, lots of chairs in or out of the shade, and with water shoes to avoid a few rocks in the ocean, swimming was wonderful! You can walk right or left further down the beach if you're extremely picky about a few rocks, but we didn't have an issue as I thought we might from some of the other reviews. Just bring some water shoes and you're set. The pool was big and separated into two sections. One section is where they had the games, water aerobics, water volleyball, etc., but it wasn't too loud or annoying and it didn't go on all the time, all day. The other side was quieter and more relaxed. Both sides have a shallow section and the pool has an enclosed area for very small children. Something for everyone, young and old. Overall, the food was great. We always found something we loved in the Albatros buffet and our favourite restaurant was the Mexican (Maria's). The Countryside Skewers were excellent! As with every all inclusive, not all food is to everyone's liking -- it's individual taste. You will always find something delicious to eat, especially at the fresh grills (ie. chicken fajitas, french toast, pancakes, etc.). Our 5 year old is a picky eater and we ALWAYS found something great for him, so that speaks volumes. We did eat at the Italian restaurant, which was extremely busy and popular every night... the only complaint I had with it was my food sort of tasted like palm oil on the grill. Everyone else seemed to enjoy that restaurant and went back many times, so maybe it was just me. Wish they would use a different cooking oil there, but alas... We didn't get hassled by ANY timeshare people at all, so can't comment there. Even if we had been approached, a simple \"no gracias\" would suffice I'm sure. We also tipped all our servers and housekeeping staff daily ($20 to $40 pesos) as we believe in rewarding great service. Especially the drink servers on the beach and by the pool who walk back and forth waiting on people in the heat ALL day. I couldn't do it... so I definitely wanted to tip them! CECILIA MEJIA was one of the best servers we had during our trip -- she is a beautiful person with a fabulous smile and sense of humour... and the service you receive from her is perfection. We loved her... and so did our son. She tickled him and blew kisses and won him over immediately. And young OSCAR in the main Albatros restaurant was a fabulous server as well -- he took great care of us whenever we ate our dinner at the buffet. Thanks Oscar! The night entertainment was really good -- not the super cheesy stuff that we've encountered for years at all inclusives, where we have mostly cringed. The dancers were trained, athletic, beautiful, and entertaining. Every show was different and had a theme and we saw 3 of them during our stay. We took one full day trip to XCARET, which is fabulous for families and very close to Playa Del Carmen. It was my 3rd time there and I thoroughly enjoyed it once again. Book through BEST DAY for the XCARET PLUS -- that is the best way to go. $119 per adult, $60 for children over 40\" tall, and free for small children under 40\". Some would say that almost $300 USD for the day is expensive, but we thought it was well worth the money. We ate our lunch at the Peninsula Restaurant overlooking the ocean and right beside the Dolphins - the meal was included with our Plus package. Excellent food, service, and view! My favourite thing to do at XCARET is float down one of the underground rivers with a lifejacket and flippers -- a must!!! We also booked the 4 course meal at the night time show (Tlachco Dinner) which gives you the best seats in the house, excellent food and wine. It was very reasonable and I highly recommend it. It's a full day with lots of walking, but very fun!! I'm sure there's much more I can comment on, but I think I've covered the main points. Just remember... if you want everything EXACTLY like home (ie, food, language, etc.), then STAY HOME. You are in a different country with a different culture and this hotel aims to please and ensure you have a great vacation. If there's an issue, be nice and polite and ask for what you want and I'm sure they'll bend over backwards to accommodate. Go with the flow, don't sweat the small stuff, and you'll have a terrific holiday!

The resort is exceptionally clean and service is very good. The resort is in a great location for shopping on 5th Avenue and walking in dowtown Playa Del Carmen. My wife has celiac disease and we had never been to an all inclusive resort before and had been assured we would be ok. The first night we tried eating with family at a specialty restaurant only to be told they did not know or understand a food allergy (no wheat/ gluten). My wife was very upset as we had 5 more days to stay and we were unsure where we could eat or what to do. Luckily we met Eliazar the Capitan at Albatros he warmly said he would personally take care of her and not to worry. Every time we went for dinner he would warmly greet us and personally take care of her. Even the night of the wedding he personally brout her dinner and dessert into the ballroom from Albatros! I would also be remiss to not recognize Freddy from Albatross who every morning and afternoon would greet us by name and again personally assure she would be ok. Freddy we would see throughout the resort and he would stop smile and chat with us making us feel lucky to have friends now at this resort. In short the resort was great these key employees I would steal away in a heartbeat for my business. Only drawback keeping the resort from 5 stars is the beach it's not good for swimming full of seaweed from boats (they cleaned it up every day for hours trying to make it better) and rocks on the dock side.

The nightly shows are excellent, and far more professional than I've seen at any other hotel. The hotel itself is lively and upbeat. I can't comment on the food because it really is a matter of taste. Some things I tried were delicious, and other things were awful. But again, it's a matter of taste. There is plenty to choose from, so I'm sure you will always find something you like. We had quite a few little problems......the toilet backed up, the AC wasn't working well, the phone wasn't working, etc. .....BUT, just a call to the front desk and each time someone was at our door within 10 minutes.

The first thing the unpersonal acting like front office employees did was telling us that our room was not available and they put us in a ocean front room in the hope that we would like to upgrade. This room had a horrible old socks smell, and the promised extra beds for our kids were not placed. Finally they came up with two old, damaged and smelling beds. Our linnen was dirty as well. The front office people try to satisfy you with a 30 dollar freed to spend in the hotel shop. Going in there depresses one directly. As a former hotel manager and now investor I decided tot open up my eyes through out the day and night to look closely to this All Inclusive Show. I am used to this business model so I let the show began. Like so many other All Inclusive you see the typically things to make the margin. The post mix pistols give more water than cola. Put a lot of ice in it, some alcohol and there you go. The more the hotel sells, the better the bonusses probably they receive from houses like Bacardi or brands like Pepsi in Mexico? Amazing to see that almost every American or Canadian can be fooled so easily. In Europe te Russians come to All Inclusive, they are not easy, far from that, but not as dumm as I have seen so many other guests in the Gran Porto Real. The beach is te worst from all of Playa del Carmen. Please go 500m further and have a really good swimm. The beach beds are old, many are damaged and far from comfortable. Towels are free and clean. Entertainment is a word that cannot be used in this hotel. Please go to Turkey and het a training! When you come to relax on the beach this will most likely happen. You have to leave the relaxing spot you found because day after day there is a wedding on the beach. Americans or Canadians. These happy people will return to the restaurant in the evening to disturb your dinner and finally they take over the bars to disturb you evening.Of course you can find another place on the beach between heavily tattood guests. ( seen some neo nazi tats ......) So you go out to 5th Avenue where 80% of the goods you can buy is made in China and can be bought in China for 90% lower prices. And again the U.S. amnd Canadean guests buy and buy. You can try to book f.i. a trip to Xel HA in the hotel for USD 99 pro person. But after a 15 min walk you come in the Wal Mart and you pay 80USD incl transport and the same conditions BUT NO TIME SHARE. The hotel is very noisy and you come in tired and leave even more tired. The one that deserves a raise is the Chef. The food is top!!. Housekeeping is top as well!! Waiters and bar staff are clearly trained. Overtrained and they loose spontanity. Maybe it works for USA and Canada but Europeans do not like this kind of service mostly. Good staff like Avilla and Verlain would make loads of money in European All Inclusive. Hotels must make money, they suffer under economic conditions directly, but hotels like this must have a soul to survive. The soul here is sold to a money making show that is far to obvious. The best experience by far are the housekeeping girls and men and the worst is the front office. We were discussing to come back in 2012 and try again. But the unpersonal, uncaring money focussed check out made it easy for us. We will come back to this beautiful country and it's friendly people, but in another hotel and we will not recommend this place.", "Date": "February 24, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Winnipeg, Canada", "Title": "\u201cGreat Holiday\u201d", "Author": "mlsp", "ReviewID": "UR97857446", "Content": "We spent Feb 05/11 to Feb 19/11 at the Gran Porto Real.

We LOVED it! We were in a junior beach walkout suite, and had a wonderful all inclusive package that included access to three restaurants at the Royal. The room was exceptionally clean, comfortable bed with lots of pillows. Let the water in the shower run for a bit and you'll have plenty of hot water! We were able to sit on our balcony and watch the sun rise, as well as view the activity at the beach bar. This room was on the windy side of the building which we appreciated on those hot days. When we wanted to get out of the wind, we escaped to our cabana which was assigned to the room. The mini bar was well stocked and replenished daily; towel art was beautiful; robes and slippers came with the room and were greatly appreciated! Another nice touch was the bottle of wine and fruit plate delivered to our room on our first night. The staff were all amazing; the buildings so clean and well kept; service exceeded our expectations, and the weather was magnificent! We did it all...parasailing, snorkelling, massages on the beach...and a LOT of eating. Our travelling party were particularly touched by the approach to heartfelt service (demonstrated by the hand on heart!) this resort demonstrates. Several staff were exceptional in their service. Astrid (concierge) went above and beyond to assist us with locating a lost piece of luggage, and then Aaron (bellboy) who kept on top of getting the luggage from the Air Canada Vacation office, then located us in the hotel to make sure we received it. We also had wonderful experiences with Magda (massage therapist), Miguel (beach bar), the great band Tequila, Florencia (Albatross), Alex (guest services), Geranamo (Pelicanos), Patricia (room attendant/maid), Chris and Angel (Asianas)...and so many more amazing staff members who made our trip so memorable. The food is almost impossible to describe - it is SO delicious! The chefs that Real employs are second to none. Every meal we ate we described as the \"best ever\"! We enjoyed traditional Mexican at Maria's; a mix of oriental dishes at the Royal's Asiana's (try the Tempura ice cream for sure!); amazing Italian cuisine at Il Pescatore; wonderful steaks at Maria Marie's (Royal); and incredible fresh food daily at the buffet Albatros. The morning omelettes (made with a smile by a wonderful lady) were a hit with our group. The wait staff in Albatros are so friendly and made us feel welcome. None of us are big drinkers, but we were always brought tasty smoothies from each of these locations. We did really enjoy the house wines with our meals. The beach is nice - very clean. The water directly in front of the Gran Porto is challenging to swim in due to the number of rocks, but it is a quick walk over to the Royal where the swimming is great. We didn't take advantage of the pool nor did we take in many of the evening shows, although the one that we did see on February 14th was amazing! It also looked like a great place to take children - the entertainment staff kept them going and busy, despite language barriers. It was a pleasure to see. We took an excursion to Xcarat which is not to be missed. You really do need two days to get everything in but at minimum, try one of the floating river trips and the closing show. It is spectacular. We also snorkelled and parasailed. The Gran Porto is a quick walk to 5th Avenue where the nightlife and shopping are great. We'll be back and we are already highly recommending the Gran Porto Real to anyone who will listen to us!", "Date": "February 23, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Sleep Quality": "2", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Minneapolis, Minnesota", "Title": "\u201cGo with your second choice.\u201d", "Author": "Chicken1201", "ReviewID": "UR97646368", "Content": "This was our first all inclusive experience and we had high hopes that the reviews we had read and our travel agent would steer us in the direction of a relaxing few days on the beach with sun, food, drinks and a good sleep. Luckily, the sun delivered. I would not recommend this resort to anyone. We chose it because it fit our budget and looked from the website to have all we needed and our travel agent said she would return her as she had stayed int he past. Several key points were huge disappointments for us: 1. They try to sell you a timeshare. For all their advice to stay away from the time share people in the airports it's actually a self serving piece of advise - they want you to buy their time share. Which they will deny is a time share but instead a different type of vacation that you can use anytime in any of their locations - it's just a different way of saying a time share. When we were 'invited' to tour the resort next door in exchange for 500 pesos to use at the resort we point blank asked if it was a sales pitch (twice) and were told in very clear terms that it was not. This was a bold faced lie - it was a sales pitch. We were also told that since we were celebrating our anniversary we could have breakfast at the nicer resort next door. However, only if we went with the sales rep. So it was NOT romantic to say the least. We lost an entire morning of our vacation to this baloney before we just walked out. They were rather rude to us about the experience and when we pointed out that we were lied to they clammed up and wouldn't say another word. And no, we didn't get 500 pesos. I felt the staff were dishonest and misleading because of this. 2. The other disappointing piece of this resort is the food. The analogy I have come up with is that if you order a cappuccino and don't mind getting one that is squirted out of a machine, then you'll probably like the rest of the food too. It's all tasteless, overcooked, and reused so many times it's a bit scary. The one good meal we had was at a restaurant out in the downtown area. And while they claim to have a number of restaurants - they don't. There are three. The buffet cafeteria that is open most of the day and then a 'mexican' and 'italian' restaurant where the poor staff are overworked so that you wait a long time for a meal. And when you do it is often cold and usually bland. 3. The room. We explained to our travel agent who I can only assume explained to the hotel that we wanted a vacation with a quiet room so we could sleep well. They put us in the first room on the first floor next to the air hockey table, kids room and bar. And all of the halls are tiled so everything echos. Needless to say we asked to be moved and they told us they only had one other room available but it had double beds instead of a king. Or, for 150 dollars we could stay next door in a room that was only slightly less noisy. We chose the double beds. We witnessed and talked to several guests who said they also tried to put them in these rooms. It is my opinion that they attempt to put people in these undesirable rooms and then move the ones that complain or rejoice when people don't say anything. 4. The beach. Most of the beach here is covered in sandbags to prevent erosion or has boats docked in it. If you walk to the resort next door the beach is FANTASTIC - sandy, wide open. So while you can't sit over there with out getting yelled at you can at least go in a nice beach. I believe there is the option here of JUST getting a room and not the food/drink portion. If this hotel fits your budget, go this route. And make sure you ask for a different room if you don't like yours RIGHT AWAY. There is a supermarket in walking distance and tons of restaurants close by so it will be easy to do your own food and you'll be much happier. We were pleased to discover that we saved a bunch of money by walking down the beach a ways to find a massage - two people, one hour each for 45 dollars. And it was way quieter than the beach massages offered at Gran Porto. I hate to sound like all I am doing is complaining about a much needed vacation but we were expecting so much more from this resort. Luckily we were smart enough to put our towels out on the chairs we wanted very early in the morning so we enjoyed the beautiful sun and walked over to the lovely beach several times.

Even though I knew this was a smaller property, I had a bit of a shock upon arrival seeing that this is located in the middle of a fairly populated area. There was no sprawling drive to the entrance, no grand lobby nor elaborate grounds like the other all inclusives that I've stayed at previously. However once I got over that, I continued to be impressed at the high level of service, cleanliness and how they were able to do so much in a limited amount of space. We booked a Junior Suite Oceanview which was a gorgeous room with a gigantic bathroom, however the view directly overlooked the neighboring hotel (the sister property, the Royal). You had to stand on the balcony and look over to the right to see the ocean. There were no upgrades available on our arrival, but the next day we moved to an oceanfront room for just $40 more per day. The gorgeous view of the pool, beach and ocean was well worth it. A picture of the view is attached. The beach is fairly small and as others have said, it's pretty rocky. There are also quite a few small motorized boats that are anchored in front of the hotel which you'll occassionally see come or go (but it's not like a busy dock area). If you walk 2 minutes in either direction, you'll find very few rocks and no boats. Also there is quite a bit of foot traffic on the beach from the large boat dock next to the hotel where many cruise ship passengers (from Cozumel) arrive. The hotel security does a great job at not allowing anyone without a resort wrist band from using the amenities. I personally had no issue with the beach as I was looking for soft sand, a comfy lounger and the sound of waves to relax too. The food was very good at the buffet and the two ala carte restaurants. To get to the ala carte restaurants, you need to literally exit the hotel lobby and walk down the block which I found odd at first but got over. There isn't much nightlife, which was fine with me as I really just wanted to veg for a few days. If you want more excitement, there are plenty of lively bars within walking distance on the beach and the shopping area in town or you may want to consider a more livelier resort. The Gran Porto does provide some basic activities during the day and they do a really good job with their nighlty shows. The best part of my stay was probably the service. I've never been at an AI where just about every employee greets you and makes you feel very welcome. Even at the buffet, a server would be at your table within seconds greeting you and taking your drink order. I was extremely impressed with the wait service at the beach too. Of course giving the attendant a dollar or two always helps, but was happy to do so as they were extremely accomodating and guest focused.

Guests need to fly, and flying needs boarding passes. Get on it! Finally, there was some ambiguity about tipping which I'd love to have cleared up...doubt I ever will. Anyway, we tipped everybody on an individual basis, though an all-inclusive claims to \"include tips\". So, is it the case that all the staff in the hotel divide a pool of tips determined by the number of guests, or does the hotel just assume that guests will tip and therefore withhold any gratuities and keep wages low because of this? This is an issue of exploitation, and I think it would be better if the hotel management were clear about this. Would like to thank the staff who really went out of their way to make our stay enjoyable and memorable: The bellboys, Tilo and Aaron, the housekeeping staff (especially Rosa and Martha), as well as the servers Ismael and Ceclia. Our kids also had an incredible time with the Kids Club girls: Gina, Diana, Nelly, and Dulce. Thank you all, and we'll tell our friends about you!", "Date": "February 16, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Deep River, Canada", "Title": "\u201cAbsoultely the very best in all ways\u201d", "Author": "cajuna", "ReviewID": "UR96918858", "Content": "The visit was exeptional.

If there was anything that I could complain about at this resort was that the live bands stopped at 11 and there was no disco, or dancing. It is so close to 5th avenue that they don't have a disco. That was dissappointing as we were not bar hoppers and would have loved a place to dance at night. I am sure that this is same as many at the resort.

Summary: I highly recommend the Gran Porto Real for your vacation in Playa del Carmen. The location is perfect, service is very good, quality is very good, and I feel I received good value for the money. I'll try to touch on some key thoughts below: General impressions: We really liked Playa del Carmen and the Gran Porto Real. The beach is long, wide, and beautiful. 5th Avenue offers browsing and shopping and an escape from your hotel. We stayed in the tourist zone, behaved ourselves, and as a result never felt insecure. Having access to the ferry to Cozumel was a big plus. The weather was fantastic - very comfortable. Check-in: smooth and fast. I used on-line check-in from home before arriving, but the front desk still wanted to see my physical credit card on arrival. I didn't perceive much value from the on-line check-in process. Regardless, the check-in process was friendly and fast - no worries. Service: with a smile. You truly get the sense these people care about their work and doing a good job (i.e. taking care of you and your family). Everyone was friendly and helpful. Security: watchful and solid. My wife and I were stopped several times by hotel security (politely and professionally) to check our hotel bracelets and ensure we belonged there. Rooms: good size, clean, comfortable. We elected to go with an Ocean View room, and I'm very glad we did. Sitting on the balcony, with a warm breeze and a view of the ocean - priceless. I agree with the comments from others - the beds are quite firm. I normally like a softer bed, but slept just fine. The rooms are cleaned very well. Note: be aware that on humid days moisture can collect on the cool floor tiles and be slippery - tread cautiously. Food: tasty, and a good variety. The buffet has something for everyone, and the overall quality was very good. We ate dinner in the specialty restaurants, which offer a decided step up in service, flavor, presentation, and quality. Beach: In front of the hotel - not good. A few hundred yards away - excellent. If a requirement is to stand up from your beach chair and wade into the water for a nice swim in the ocean, this is not the hotel for you. If you don't mind walking down the beach a few hundred yards in either direction and sitting on a towel, everything is great. The Gran Porto beach is unfortunately situated such that the ocean bottom is rocky, and there's quite a bit of seaweed floating by the shore. We spent the bulk of our time sitting around the pool (beautiful) and swimming in it to cool off. We went for long walks on the beach north and south of Gran Porto, and the beach is gorgeous. Demographic: During our stay the average age was upper 50's / lower 60's. A very low-key, relaxed group. North American primarily, with smaller numbers of visitors from Europe and Central / South America. Location: Excellent. Going north from Gran Porto the beach is wide and beautiful. Going south from Gran Porto the ferry terminal is a 10-minute walk away. 5th Avenue shopping is about 2 blocks away. You're right on the beach. Overall: An excellent hotel. I would recommend it to family and friends, and would certainly stay at Gran Porto Real again on a future visit.", "Date": "February 11, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Montreal, Canada", "Title": "\u201cexceptionnal\u201d", "Author": "Sergio073", "ReviewID": "UR96239869", "Content": "Ecological hotel, large rooms, very clean with all commodities, balcony, personal very friendly and attentive, lot of trees and garden, situated 3 minutes from the main street, I enjoy this hotel, which provides me with all my needs of confort, garden, view of the ocean, excellent food (3 restaurants), large swimming pool, friendly environment and also posibility to use facilities of the others Real hotel in Playa and Cancun.

Other than a less-than-perfect check-in (only one of the five couples who had booked upgraded suites got the king-sized beds they expected), and VERY noisy rooms (as another poster noted, there is not a lot of sound insulation, and balconies are anything but private in most areas; we had lobby noise outside our first room and construction all day long in the second), things were excellent. IMMACULATE hotel with staff that is friendly and eager to please. The food was second to none and not one person in our 14-person group got sick. And believe me, we ate a lot. Rooms were well kept (Yesmenia, our maid, was outstanding), we barely noticed any bugs, the staff worked hard to keep the beach clean (it is much more private here than at neighbouring resports, with loads of chairs and shade cover -- though ocean swimming is safer at Royal next door because there is less rock), and service was top-notch (thanks to Antonio and Pablo especially, and Amadour at Pescatore restaurant). No problems to speak of. Everyone in our group was immensely satisifed. Being a mere two blocks from 5th Ave was a luxury! Re: Excursions: We pre-booked the Xel-ha/Tulum trip through Cancun Discounts and HIGHLY recommend it. A perfect day worth every last penny. Do yourself a favour and book this trip. Also did Coba Express through Best Day Travel (booked on site at hotel through Expedia) and found it worth the price, though our guide was somewhat lacking (if I had to do it again, I'd take the cheaper bus to Coba from 5th Ave and then hire a \"Mayan taxi\" on-site at Coba, where the local guides fill you in on each ruin site for a fraction of the price: $10 US). In short, book with confidence at this resort. To travel in a group of 14 and have no real complaints was nothing short of a miracle.

Buying this trip at the last minute, knowing very little about Playa De Carmen and having never been to Mexico I was cautiously optimistic. I lucked out! My first impression was very good. The resort is at the end of a dead end street and next to two other higher end resorts and close enough to 5th ave and the clubs. The lobby is gorgeous with marble flooring, high ceilings and was meticulously clean. We arrived early and had our luggage stored until we could check in at 3pm. We acquainted ourselves with the hotel and found ourselves at the buffet which would soon become our mainstay for food while in Playa. The food was definitely above average, but it was the desire and the passion of the staff that made it what it was. Antonio was the epitome of this, high energy, desire to please and very entertaining. My game plan for the week was to relax and take in as much sun as possible. I got to know the sports and entertainment team very quickly. There were five of them ( Karina, Cesar, Alejandro, Victor and Amanda). The first night I was there I went to Coco Bongo with Victor and Karina and several other hotel guests. My family wasn't interested in going so I went by myself. The two staff members went out of their way to make sure I enjoyed myself, and introduced me to the other guests there. It really set the tone for the rest of the trip. I really can't say enough good things about the entertainment team. They all excelled at different things, but they all did an excellent job at remembering your name, making you feel at home and being genuinely interested in what you have to say. The activities ranged from the standard to the unique, but they were always enjoyable. I think one of the most impressive things was the execution and efficiency of all the staff. There must of been 150+ staff on site. From security, entertainment, food and cleaning. It seemed like they were always busy, quick to fix any issues that show up and always pleasant. If tours and excursions are your thing, there are plenty. Ranging from $50 to $100, some from your doorstep others are to a 1-2hr bus ride you can scuba-dive (gorgeous, highly recommend), visit several Mayan sites, nature sites/zoos, zip lining, para-sailing etc. There is something for everyone.

The hotel staff couldn't be more helpful. We were in standard rooms which are perfectly adequate, kept clean with a fridge housing chilled, bottled water and soft drinks, all replaced daily. The 3 rooms did vary in size quite considerably, but it wasn't a problem as we wanted to be near each other. One unexpected thing was that the lifts only go to floor 3 and there are 5 floors in the hotel, so if you have mobility issues, then there could be problems with lots of stairs. Fortunately our senior members are reasonably fit, so could manage the final climb of 2 floors. Entertainment staff do a first class job and are so good at remembering guests' names. There was a quality 45 minute show 6 nights a week at 8.30, so a good time for kids. Pools are great, but be warned, if you have a confident child who is a non-swimmer, arm bands or buoyoncy jacket (as we had) are essential, as there is a shallow 18\" ledge which leads straight into 4 ft 9\" pool. There is a Kids' Club where I saw 2 buoyoncy jackets and arm bands, and we borrowed buckets and spades from there. Before our granddaughter arrived we enjoyed the first few swims of the holiday in the tranquil pool and sampled the sushi - very nice. HOTEL TAKE NOTE: please make a separate area for smokers outside (Gaviotas bar and bridge only?). It is not at all pleasant having smokers either side of you on sun loungers, especially with children nearby too. Restaurants - Albatros buffet restaurant is excellent. The Italian and Mexican are over-rated - nice for a traditional meal 'out' and for atmosphere - in 2 weeks the menu didn't change and food was presented nicely, but was nothing special. The Albatros is great for all meals, with SO much choice and particularly good for breakfasts. And Sergio in the Albatros does a mean Irish Coffee - worth having one for entertainment value alone! Gym is good and so is the jacuzzi on the roof top! Beach in front of hotel is a bit seaweedy and coral rocks jut out in sea - but contrary to current reports, the Mexicans are out there working hard for our benefit, clearing the debris and improving the seashore for our benefit.

We took a beach front walkout and had our own palapa and the extra money is worth that service to my husband who likes to be able to sit in the shade and be guaranteed \"his spot\". There are lots of activities of which you can choose to participate in or not participate in. I appreciate that there are not always people hassling you on the beach to sell trinkets and tours. The Mayan coffee that Rigoberto made at Maria's restaurant and his service were wonderful. My niece was married here and the wedding planners and service on the beach were awesome, Thanks Freddy our capitan. Beach service for drinks has been consistent the past three years with our favorite Jose. We also like that there is no disco on site as that is quieter. There are discos nearby if you choose.

They are fun, amazing people that make everyone feel like part of a huge family! Another wonderful staff member is Addy, who did up our room every day. We waited anxiously to see what she would make out of the towels in the room. She even used our own glasses to dress up a couple of really sweet animal creations!! I have to say that I walked in one day as Addy was cleaning, and she pointed to our son's iPod Touch (that I didn't realize he'd left on a table) and then to the safe. She didn't have to do that. I guess the only issue I had at the beginning was that the Jr Suites our group was booked into were not the ones we were expecting (smaller). I found out later that they have done extensive renovations and now have several levels of Jr Suites. While we would have preferred the larger ones, not one person in our group really had a problem. (Everyone was just grateful not to be in the snow!!). The food at the buffet was good, with something for everyone. Il Pescatore, the Italian restaurant on the corner, was amazing yet again. Unfortunately, we didn't remember the names of the staff there, but they all make sure your evening is one to remember. I want to point out too, that at no point did any of our group feel at all unsafe. There is always security patrolling the beach, and you see them all over when you are shopping on 5th Ave. Not that the drugs aren't there - most of us were approached at one point or another, but just said No and kept going and that was that. We also made sure we were always somewhere that was busy, and that no one went anywhere on their own. I guess I just want to say too, that your trip is what you make it, too.

Our breakfast waiters Ivan and Daniel always had our mimosas waiting for us and did everything they possibly could to see that we were very well taken care of. The pool staff is also unbelievable - Pable, Jose, Teresa and Jesus always had a friendly smile and hello and never let you go without a drink. After the first day they never even had to ask what we were drinking anymore - they always remembered. The activities team once again was fun and enthusiastic. Chicken, Ceasar, Allehandro and Amanda always tried to include everyone and make your time fun filled. The crazy game of the day I would have to say was by far the best and most fun. Phillipe at the swim up bar makes probably the best drinks in the whole resort but be careful (I think he makes them a little stronger than anywhere else!) Our housekeeper Sanna always had our room done early and it was immaculate and she always left us some beautiful and fun towel art. I cannot say enough about the staff at the GPR - they truly treat you like their friend. As for the hotel it is by far my favorite for the location as well as the size. It was a little busier for the week after New Years but there were still chairs around the pool and on the beach and no really long lines for the restaurants. Albatross, Marias and El Pescatore again delivered with fantastic food and lots of it. The beach in front of the hotel has had a major overhaul in the last year.

They even prepared the fish that the guys caught during the day for dinner. We also all enjoyed Pablo and Cecelia M., and Miriam, the beach/bar servers and our Albotross dining room servers, Lorenzo, Camas, Ishmael and Sanchez (and so many others) were superb. Ma. Magdalena from the spa gives the most wonderful massages - had one in the end beach gazebo while hearing the surf murmuring on the beach. So wonderful. Manicure by Gilda also. Several of us tried the activities put on by the activity staff - water aerobics, snorkling, yoga - all really fun. All kinds of dancers, singers, salsa band, games, jet skis, kayaks, fishing, cycling and other activities to entertain us Canadians sheltering in Mexico from our cold season. Also Best Day tours can arrange tours to Tulum and many other cultural destinations. Thanks Emilio Lopez and Pamela for their arrangements and attention to detail. We booked only a standard room, and while small with basic furniture it had a lovely outdoor gallery corridor with a glimpse of the sea and great ventilation. We hardly ever used the AC. Very nice shower and moderate furnishings, but extremely clean with artistic towel decorations daily in #510 created by our cleaner, Adrianna(?) Poot. In all, it was a memorable vacation. This is not a huge resort, so it felt like home and the staff almost felt like family, which is why I have mentioned so many staff by name. Also, there was excellent security staff, who patrolled the beaches and the hotel and lifeguards who kept watch on the beach. Thanks again. The location is really great, because it is only 2 blocks off 5th Avenue which has many, many blocks of shopping and restaurants and yet the hotel seemed quite quiet.

Very clean \u2013 staff were always cleaning the floors, bathrooms, etc. Great location near 5th Ave \u2013 great for walking in the evening after dinner or if you want to shop. If you forgot/need personal care items\u2013 the Wallmart is about 15 min walk (and have better prices than along 5th Ave). Westjet rep. They want you to go to the meeting so you can get your transfer voucher. As soon as I told them that I had been to the area before and had seen most sights (which I did) the meeting took about 10 minutes. I just wanted to find out about two excursions that I was interested in. Room We booked a Junior suite but they told us were the room was (overlooking the roof of the hotel) but for an extra $20 US pp per night we could get upgraded to a Junior suite with Ocean view. We looked at the regular junior suites and they faced a concrete wall over looking the service entrance to the hotel and the room didn\u2019t seem very bright. The Junior suite Ocean view was a bit larger and had a much nicer view and the room was more airy. For those who like to drink \u2013 it comes stocked with a 4 bottle liquor cabinet. We took the upgrade but were able to negotiate a better price. Book the junior suite ocean view before leaving home (we were in Room 324 so any room starting at 322 and higher will get you a nice view of the ocean). I think they purposely have bad junior suites and standard rooms so people pay for the upgrades. Staff: Excellent service. Very curtious. No complaints Beach: Sand was beautiful. No problems getting a bed at any time of day. Rather than trees or those papalapas , the resort has these structures with screening on them. Waiter service at the beach was great. Only disappointment was the water. It was very rocky so you really couldn\u2019t use it except for a narrow path that everyone used. If you want to play in the water you have walk to the resort next door \u2013which was no big deal. Food: Buffet was ok (all meals). Smaller than other places I have been but enough choice. Service was good. Restaurants \u2013 only 2 a la carte Italian and Mexican. No reservations needed so you can go as often as you like. Dress is casual (even saw people wearing shorts). Both are very good but don\u2019t have the pasta at the Italian (then again I\u2019m fussy when it comes to pasta). The house wine is good. Very good service. If you are a big group you may want to get there as soon as they open so you can find a place together. There is always food around somewhere. The lobby snack bar is opened 24 hours. This is also the Internet room. The mixed drinks are very good and all good sizes including glasses of water (or you can get bottles of water at the lobby bar). You don\u2019t need to bring your thermal mugs as the waiters are constantly asking if you want drinks. You don\u2019t have time for your drink to get warm. Shows: Very tasteful. They have a dance troop that performs different dance styles every night except Sunday. They last bout 40 minutes. There is usually a small band that plays music after until about 11 pm. If you want to party there are many bars and clubs along 5th Ave. Highlights: We didn\u2019t do any excursions this time. Walking the beach at night. It was very nice and safe. Neat to see what the other hotels do at night on the beach CocoBongo Nightclub. What a crazy and fun place. Well worth the $60. It is a 5 minute walk from the hotel. Two hotel staffers (Cesar and Alejandro) walked us over and made sure we got a table and that a waiter saw us. They stayed with us for \u00bd hour. We took a very quick cab back at 3 am. There are taxis all over the place as soon as you come out so it is very safe. The bouncers pat down the men before going in including the hotel staff and women get they bags checked.

We stayed in a family junior suite that had bunk beds with a trundle bed which the two year old loved sleeping in. It was all one room but we had a balcony that we could sit out on after the kids went to bed. We had a great view overlooking the pool and beach but the downside to that was that it got noisy at night with the bars and the dance shows. Luckily our kids slept through them but the noise might bother older kids. The room was clean and the housekeeping staff did a great job every day. To a person, every staff member at this resort was friendly and helpful. They were kind to our kids and made us feel comfortable and welcomed. This resort is very family friendly, there were lots of kids around and people (guests and staff) were understandable about kid behavior. Unfortunately we only ate at the buffet because of the unpredictability of the two year old but the food there was good-there was a lot of variety and always something that was made fresh. Our daughter loves fruit and she was in heaven-eating tons of watermelon, pineapple, and cantaloupe at every meal. The guacamole was fantastic- our baby son loved it! There was always food being served somewhere which was great for snacks and early toddler meal times. We liked that we could take food out of the buffet to the room or the pool and no one minded. Room service is also included but doesn't start until 8 am. We spent all of our time by the pool or on the beach and loved being so close to the hotel. If the baby needed to eat or the toddler needed a nap, our room was right there. We also enjoyed being be able to order drinks whenever we wanted them. The entertainment staff was very friendly and enthusiastic. Our daughter liked joining in the water aerobics class. The beach does have some sandbags on it but that didn't bother us too much. The ocean is beautiful and clear and pretty shallow for a while out, you do have to watch your step because there is coral and rocks on the bottom. We really liked how the hotel is close to the town, especially because we had to buy shoes for our daughter the first night we were there and we easily walked to Mega, a Mexican Wal-Mart. We also walked around Fifth Avenue a lot which is the pedestrian street with stores selling touristy stuff. I used the fitness center in the hotel and it was small but had two treadmills and there was always one free. There is a kids club where you can leave children over the age of four. We went there with our kids and the staff was really nice to them and had things for them to play with. It was a good place to go when the kids needed a break from the sun or we had some time to kill before a meal. All in all this was a great vacation, we loved this hotel and would highly recommend it for families with young children.

What a change... Kids club: WOW. My 4 y.o. loved it. All the girls were so good, Dulce, Georgina, Nelly, and Diana (you just want to take her back with you). I was never worried, and that is just priceless. Whenever your child ask for you, they bring him/her to you. Service/waiter: the best of the best: Pablo. Jesus was good too. Retaurant: WOW. eat both at the 2 restaurants and at the buffet. Everything was amazing. One day, I met the chef and I was telling him how much their arroz con leche was good, and I had an upset stomach, so he told me that he would make the arroz con leche the next day and if I did not feel better, he could make me a chicken noodle soup for lunch or supper, now, that's outstanding client service. We were there for the 24 of december and we had amazing lamb chops. On our last day, they had sushi for lunch and dim sum at night. I gained 3 pounds...in 2 weeks :-( One conept Gran Porto understand better than most resort: you DON'T NEED reservation for the restaurant, and that's a BIG PLUS. I wish resort would understand when you are on a holiday, you do not want a schedule. Maria's is Mexican and Il Pescadore is Italian, both excellent. At the italian, they have buns stuffed with cream cheese, they are Soooooooooooo good. Housekeeping was really good too. The last day we were there, there was a small explosion with fire, it was one of the A/C (condensator). Evrything was under control after 20 minutes, we did not even smell the fire (the A/C are located outside). The only reason I realized it was because my room was next to it but always felt safe. They were very efficient in handling it. Entertainment: these guys are doing an amazing job: Ceasar, Pollo, Amanda, Alejandro, Manuel. My 11 y.o. went biking with them, he took scuba diving lessons, played in the Tzone (Xbox), learn how to fold towels in animals. They (entertainment) tend to speak too much spanish, but when we were there, there were some people from Latin America and Spain. I was surprised by the quality of the shows, the dancers are very good. The Dec 31 show was outstanding. The disappointment was with the beach, it has a lot of coral, however, if you do not mind walking a few minutes, it was much better on the other side of the Pier. Bring swimming shoes. One big plus: there was no trouble finding long chairs and shade. I do not recommend the standard rooms as the have plantation shutters, and although it's great for fresh air, it's really bad when you want to sleep. Sometimes they do not realize that their big charriots are making so much noise (towels, sheets, room service). Make sure you choose at least a junior suite, not to encounter such a problem. The resort's location is perfect, you're never afraid to go outside at night, you are always in busy street with lights (near standard rooms...). The weather was a little chilly the 1st week, but better on our second. I booked a massage by the beach and I did not relax at all, I was so cold ! Plus, the massage therapist was so-so. I specifically asked for a strong ankle massage, she barely touched that area. If you want to call Canada, it's really easy, there is an internet/long distance shop on the 5th, you can call for 6 pesos a minute. I absolutely recommend to get a latte at Ah Cacao, on the corner of 5th and the hotel street (can't remember the name, Constitu something), the coffee at the hotel is just really, really bad. I will never understand why you can't have real Kahlua in all resorst in Mexico...Another great thing when travelling with kids: room service, included.

Our room was as we remembered from the year before \u2013 plenty of room, comfortable bed and very clean. The bathroom amenities were always refreshed every day. The employees that cleaned our room were great \u2013 always had very cool towel images or fresh flowers on our bed and our refrigerator was always kept full of our favorite beverages \u2013 beer, water and pop. I wish I could have taken the shower home \u2013 it was a great shower. Everyone with us really enjoyed the hotel. There were no complaints and a good time had by all. The staff is the best \u2013 Amanda was excellent. She worked with the activities crew that kept everyone going. The activities staff are very energetic and fun to know. They keep everyone smiling. It was my sister-in-law\u2019s birthday while we were there and Amanda had given her a cake \u2013 the cake was beautiful. Everyone in the area by the pool were able to enjoy the party. It was so kind of Amanda to do that. The waiters on the beach \u2013 Jose, Teresa, Cecila, Aurelio, Manual, Alonzo and Pablo were excellent. They always knew what we wanted and were refilling our drinks whenever needed. Alex \u2013 the lifeguard was a treasure. He was so kind and had the nicest smile. Always upbeat and always making sure things were ok in the water and on the beach. David is the bartender in the Lobby Bar during the day \u2013 he is a very nice person \u2013 he makes everyone smile. He is fun to watch as he works behind the bar. He always has a smile on his face. Claudia worked in the Lobby Bar at night \u2013 she spoiled my brother-in-law. She was a very nice lady. The 24 hour snake bar room was very nice \u2013 always had good snacks and could get any kind of beverage you wanted. We really enjoyed our Mimosa\u2019s with our breakfast. The staff in the buffet was great \u2013 Osmar, Verlain and Eliazar were great - they would always make the sure there was plenty of champagne for us in the morning. They were always making sure everything was good The breakfast at the buffet was excellent. We had great omelets and cheeses and fruits \u2013 always too much but so fun to eat. We never did eat at the buffet for dinner but enjoyed the Italian restaurant il Pescatore. Our group really enjoyed eating there and most of the nights we were lucky to have our same waiter \u2013 Amador. He was the best waiter and was always taking very good care of us. The food was excellent too. On the nights Amador was not there we had Daniel. He was a good waiter too. If you go around 7 at night plan to wait \u2013 very popular but well worth the wait. We enjoyed Maria\u2019s too \u2013 Mexican . Very good. Most of our time was on the beach \u2013 some would be in the sun and others would sit under the shaded areas. As said before the waiters were excellent. It is a great people watching place. The beach might not be the best in front of the hotel but a few feet down it is fine. The hotel is in a great location but the real fact is the Gran Porto Real is a very friendly and clean place to stay. The hotel has the architecture of Old Mexico \u2013 it\u2019s beautiful, the people are happy and take great care of you.

The rooms were cleaned in a timely manner each day and the hotel itself was always very clean. We were in room 108 which over looked the street side and it was just fine. Very quiet as we were away from the pool and bar area. It was fun to sit out on our patio area and just people watch on the street. I cant say enough about the food and all the restaurants. I dont think in the whole we week that were there that our meals were duplicated. Each day and night it was something different. I'm a very picky eater and I had no problem finding something that I would like everyday. All the activities were nice. We took the bike tour that the hotel offers each day and that was really fun, It takes about 30-40 minutes and I'm so glad we did it. You got to see area's that you typically wouldn;t see. Well worth the 30 minutes. We also took a side trip to \"Xplor\". It was the best thing ever. We spent the day in the caves exploring, kayaking, swimming in the caves, ATV riding and then doing the zip lines. It was the funnest day ever. The place was beautiful, clean and again very friendly. The restaurant there was like a 5 star restaurant. Well worth the money. The other thing I liked about this hotel was that it was not so big that you had to walk for miles to get to your room or the beach or anywhere. You could go out to the pool or the beach area at any time of the day and would have no problem finding seating. It wasn;t like you had to race out there and put your towels down on chairs at 6 am. big change from other hotels we have ever stayed at. By far the \"real\" chain of hotels is by far the best chain of hotels ever. I dont think I would stay at any other chain of hotels except \"real\" hotels. We also got massages and it was the best massage ever. Ana did my massage and she was fantastic. The other person that really stands out for me is Caroline.

The Room was nothing like I expected. It was not a terrible room but, I had seen photos on the website of a beautiful room with nice decor and plenty of space and this was NOT it. Granted we did choose the Standard Room and we could have upgraded but, the difference in looks and accommodation was just ridiculous. I expected a King bed- we got two fulls. I expected a tub- just a little shower. I expected a private balcony- it opened to public (but open air) hall. More than anything, I expected it to look nice and it just really really didn't. It looked like They had a bunch of left over decorations from redoing other parts of the hotel and just stuffed them in their. The bedside table , for instance, was literally one of the cement umbrella stands from by the pool with a table top put on it. There was this hideous sponge paint all over the walls and the ceiling that looked like someone vomited in a pattern. All that being said, the rooms were clean, the beds were comfortable, and there was a nice, new TV.

The kids liked the bunk beds, but my wife and I slept in seperate beds as 2 adults in a twin size is less than comfortable - and we are 2 skinny, fit adults! `Ocean front` is missleading in some cases - yes you might face the ocean, but if you are on ground or 2nd floor then half of the hotel is behind the pool and the view to the beach is very restricted. Also, facing the pool and beach might sound nice, but when the evening show starts at 8:40 to 9:40 ity is not as nice. The shows are average, but with the hotel wrapping around the pool even if you do not want to watch yu will be forced to listen if you are in your room. It was very loud and our kids usually go to bed between 8:30 and 9pm. Right at show time. Aweful. On the topic of noise and sleep..... The `Blue Parrot` beach bar and disco is about 400m down the beach and the loud bass starts at 10pm and continues until 6am every single night. Makes for a noisy unpeaceful sleep. Worse than aweful. The buffet was average at best. Display and presentation were barely above a cafeteria, selection was limited. Not even close to `5 star`. The a la carte restaurants are Mexican and Italian. Both are quite good, but after 7 nights and trying to avoid the buffet they got boring. You can use the 3 restaurants in the sister resort across the street, but it is a $40 - $80 per person per night upgrade. Bottles of wine at the a la carte are extra charge and way too expensive. Real Club people for the members were very good and helpful. Willy was awesome. The timeshare concept they use is actually very interesting in its structure, but with the location of the resorts I would not consider it. Also interesting how the prce went from about 70k to 4k in the period of half and hour...... Pool water is cold and `hanging out in the pool` was not an option. The kids played in it quite a lot, but had to take a break every half hour or so to get out and warm up. How hard would it be to maintain a more comfortable temperature? It is the tropics is it not? Beach was good, nice sand, nice shallow area with a breakwater to reduce waves for the kids. Kids club was good for 2 - 5 or 6 years old, but over 6 years they would be bored. More of a babysitting service than a `kids club`. The hotel itself was quite nice - marble floors, clean, spacious, nice to look at.

At poolside, (Gaviotas Grill) exceptional service was provided by Carolina who was always upbeat, smiling, and who made every day quite a bit more pleasant by remembering everyone\u2019s first name and by recommending exotic drink, but our favourite was definitely the Mango daiquiri. All pool staff, Jose, Tere, Mari and Margarita were extremely pleasant to deal with. During our stay, we had dinner three times at Maria\u2019s and the food was excellent. But again it is the pleasant and great service provided by the restaurant staff which made our evenings so enjoyable. Responsibility for such great and pleasant service rested with Alonso Lagaro Arias which on every occurrence ensured that everything was perfect. Special thanks to Fabian or Labian who was in charge of the restaurant and who provided us with good food and wine suggestions and provided us with a special treat on our last visit. Thanks to our waiters Domingo, Pascual and of course special thanks to the restaurant chef Marco for such great meals. Special thanks to Lorenzo, Verlan, Freddy and co-workers Camas and Sanchez which provided the service at the Albatros restaurant morning and noon. Lorenzo\u2019s great smile, cheerfulness and excellent service got us all into a good mood to start the day.

We were very comfortable in the Ocean view junior suite we booked but had to move after the first two nights due to the birds in the lobby chirping all night long. Our first room was above the lobby on the 3rd floor - we then moved to the second floor away from the lobby and it was an equally great room, but no birds. The beach does have some erosion issues but they were actively trying to fix it during our stay, this didn't bother me by having some sandbags in a concentrated area. There were other parts of the beach that were in great condition from their hard work. We were at the beach every day - that's what I go to Mexico for! My parents did the bike tour the activity team offers twice and had a great time, my Dad took a Spanish lesson, my whole family went kayaking, all at no extra costs. We also had a great time just laying on the beach and having the amazing beach bartenders bring drinks - thanks to them! The buffet was always changing and I've stayed at a few other resorts in the Playa area and I must say this was one of the best I've had! In the morning they always had a ton of juice options which my mom loved, we tried cactus juice for the first time! :) My sister and I are big Iced coffee lovers and when requested they would make it for us special, Dion was the best - and always offering some baileys - that's the way to start the morning! The specialty restaurants were delish we ate at both twice during our stay. I loved the rolls filled with cream cheese at the Italian place - yum! The food was great and a nice variety in the menu. The swing bar on the beach was a great time in the late afternoons to get out of the sun a bit, watch the sunset and socialize.

Yes the beach is beautiful, the room excellent and super clean, the food...omg..out of this world but still it was those who you encountered everyday that really made this a very special trip and excellent hotel.You MUST use the spa rooms with the hot steam, sauna and whirlpools. The massages were the best I've ever had- Ana was THE BEST!! In the Albatros Resturant the was our \"special man\" Mora who made breakfast and lunch a total enjoyment-he couldn't do enough for us, Verlan too was extra special-especaily when dealing with children.

I do have to mention the Best Day travel group there- they pick you up at airport, other transportation and also excursions.Emillio was our rep.-wonderful job! One they recommened was the Coba Sunset. This was on of the BEST trips we took. An all day round trip to Coba, through Coba, buffet dinner (excellent) bottled water, a mayan pottery workshop were they are perserving the way Mayan pottery was made and their designs (plus you get to make something too!)& a fantastic mayan theatrical representation - in an open sky cenote!

Our room was huge and well looked after by the maid. In fact all the staff at this hotel is top notch when it comes to looking after the guests. The food at the buffet restaurant for breakfast and lunch is great, lot\u2019s of choice and variety washed down (at lunch time!) with some very drinkable white wine. Two very good al la carte restaurants add to the choice in the evening and the fact that you don\u2019t need to reserve in advance is great and we never had to wait more than a few minutes for a table. Add the very fine Asiana restaurant at the \u201cThe Royal\u201d next door (which is free if you upgrade to a master suite or walkout room and 50% for other room categories) and you put the icing on the cake.

Lots of interesting things to see when driving to the hotel! Would recommend just using taxis though as your transportation (if you aren't used to driving in Mexico) because driving is a little bit different there. You'll see that people don't always stop at the stop signs and such :) -It's located right by 5th Avenue! Spend time here at night, my family and I spent a couple hours down town nearly each night. Be ready to bargain! They will take both US dollars and pesos at the stores, some stores will even accept your debit/credit cards. It's a lot of fun and is a safe area, many tourists come here. You will see a lot of police men all over as well. The rooms: -My family stayed in a family suite the first night (this one wasn't ocean view or ocean front). We were disappointed in these rooms because we were given rooms with no view, only of some green turf and a wall. We talked to the front desk and they were wonderful about upgrading us to a different room free of charge the next and were very pleased about it. -They are very clean! The maids do a wonderful job and are very friendly. Just remember that these women speak mostly spanish incase you ever try to talk to them. Most of the other workers speak at lease some English. I would recommend tipping a few dollars/pesos every day per room, I think we left around 2-3 dollars in both of our rooms (you'll receive some towel art, too). We tried to leave a buck for the person who stalked our fridge daily also. You will learn that tipping is a big thing here! My parents brought about 100 1's for our 1 week stay, we definitely got through those if not needed a few more dollars. We tipped on occasion for drinks and also for meals. Food: -All inclusive includes three meals and I believe room service is not included as one of those meals, we used room service a few times and there were actually some decent food on the menu. Food was ok in general from our opinions: -Breakfast was great. There is an omelet bar, you can get pancakes made for you, plenty of fresh fruit and juice, cereal, etc. You should be pleased with this and be able to find something. -Mexican restaurant was alright. Wasn't terrible but I don''t think anyone in my family really liked anything here too much (maybe it was because of the mole sauce they put on a lot of the food, not used to the taste) . -Italian restaurant was ok. They have pastas, a couple small pizzas to eat, cesar salads etc. We chose to eat here a few times and were pleased with it.I am a picky eater and I was actually pleased with their menu. -Lunch buffet: It was decent, sometimes you'll find some odd foods and deserts to eat there though. We were definitely not overly excited with the food but could always find something. If you get the chance to eat their cheesecake at any of these places, that is very good! -Outside snack bar: Hot dogs, hamburgers, fries, chili, etc. This was kind of nice to have around, this isn't included as one of your meals. There's also a 24 hour snack bar inside that occasionally has something ok to eat in there. -Unlimited drinks! Try the mango tango :) That was our favorite. There is a menu with a bunch of drinks on there but you can always request something of your own too. I really liked lemonade smoothies with alcohol. The Beach: -Yes there are sandbags in front of the resort (because of erosion), but if you walk down a little bit to the Royal Real resort, you will find a lovely swimming area. Just remember you can't use their chairs just their beach unless you are staying at the Royal (they can use both resorts facilities). The sandbags don't ruin the view at all and if you would like to you can still swim in front of the resort away from the fishing boats. It's so beautiful- turquoise water and white, soft sand. Don't be afraid if you ever see a soldier on the beach or in town, they are there just to make you feel safe. -Water sports: There is a boy that has snorkel equipment, kayaks, etc. It is free but for he tells you he wants a tip- just a warning. -Parasailing: My brother and I parasailed with the man right out by the resort. It was 50 bucks per person. This was fun and I would recommend it! -Massages: We also got an 18 dollar massage for 40 minutes on the beach. This was just a few feet away from the resort on the beach. You could also do a 25 dollar massage for 1 hour. This was relaxing and a lot cheaper than the spa's massages. Activities we did away from the resort: -Selvatica Zipline: Do this, we did the Extreme Canopy Tour! So much fun! 12 ziplines in the jungle, then a 30 minute cenote swim. You can zipline into the water. It's about 100 bucks/adult. Check it out. -Deep Sea Fishing: We did this with Captain Rick's in Puerto Adventuras. We did 4 hours of fishing here for a pretty decent price. You can do more/less hours. We didn't catch anything the 2 hours of trolling but caught about 10 fish while bottom fishing. This was awesome! For this time of year though we would have rather just bottom fished the whole time because sailfish were a little slower to catch at this time. -Day trip to Tulum Mayan Ruins/Xel Ha: This was fun, but we would have rather not went on a tour bus so we could have done what we wanted. After Tulum we went to Xel Ha (Shell Ha), I would go here with your family no matter what age! It was about 115/adult and you could snorkle as long as you want with tropical fish including sting rays (no stingers) and fish such as barracudas and colorful fish. If you don't want to snorkle you can just sit on a tube in the water. My family loved this and can't wait to develop our water camera pictures! Such a cool, cool experience. You get all inclusive meals here too and it was decent food. You could also pay extra to do things such as swim with dolphins here, Sea Trek, and so forth. Here we needed to wear only biodegradable sunscreen so it wouldn't harm the fish, you can always buy this in Mexico but might be more pricey. *****All together my family and I were very sad that we had to leave this area and are already talking about our next trip (this was our first time in Mexico). We love Playa del Carmen, the resort was great but I\"m sure we would just like to try a different resort next time. I recommend this place and am sure that you will love this resort whether you are going as a family trip or with your friends! This isn't a huge partying resort though, surprisingly didn't see a lot of drunk people hanging out. Keep your mind open, enjoy the lovely Mexican people surrounding you, and have a good time.... Maybe stay away from the entertainment at night if you want something good, but it is something to watch (mostly just dancing though). I hear Coco Bongo is a good entertainment place in Playa. *******Also, don't drink the tap water or brush your teeth with it. Restaurant water comes out of jugs and is ok and the ice they use in their drinks is also ok to have. You might have to request a few more water bottles in your fridge each day too! ******* If you need to exchange money there is a person there to help you with that by the front desk (but there are money exchanges all over 5th Ave), there is an atm with a small fee (like 4 dollars)- you will receive pesos with this machine. If you need internet you can use their computers for 1 peso/minute. ****Also, we DIDN'T have any trouble with timeshare people. Yes at the airport there were a few people there asking questions about it but all you need to do is walk by them and either ignore them or say no! So easy and not a big deal at all. At the hotel we had no idea who was even the timeshare people and to this day we still don't. So don't worry about that at all. - I will try to post some pictures on here but would love to answer any questions or show you more pictures, so feel free to email me at johnsonky@mnstate.edu", "Date": "December 26, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Vancouver, Washington", "Title": "\u201cPablo made our trip very Enjoyable.\u201d", "Author": "Washington98", "ReviewID": "UR90689211", "Content": "This is our second trip to this Hotel.

My wife, Elena and I just returned from a 2 week all-inclusive stay \u2026 this was my 17 trip to Mexico over the past 25 years. Firstly, let\u2019s look at the hotel itself. It is unique in its Spanish-Italian-European architecture \u2026 beautiful arches, with granite and tile everywhere. The layout facilitates ease and fun as the reception area moves into the lounge, garden, bar and beach \u2026. it is closer to the water than any other hotel. In short, it is a beautiful, charming hotel of medium size with the best location on a world class beach! Secondly \u2026 food. Being extremely health and weight conscious I was delighted. Of course they had such a wide choice of chicken, fish and meat at every lunch and dinner \u2026 and so many vegetables to choose from, always beautifully spiced. However, what impressed me most was the quality of the food and its preparation \u2026 the fowl, fish, and meats were tender; the vegetables perfectly cooked \u2026 never over or under cooked. In having a sweet tooth I was most impressed with the desserts \u2026 both at lunch and dinner. They usually had 10 different choices ranging from flans to fruit mousses to chocolate cream cakes \u2026 always fresh. They were never too sweet \u2026 just right. They obviously have talented pastry chefs. In short, the food was of high quality both in content and preparation. The a la cartes were good but the Albatros, which is the main dining room was so exceptional we ate most of our meals there. Thirdly \u2026 service. This is always a deal breaker. I put this in the category of being cared for, nurtured and pampered. The hotel is rather \u201cspotless\u201d for they have an army of staff always cleaning before things even seen to need it. I must mention the excellent service we received with our meals at the Albatros. For breakfast and lunch Sherly was our hostess and Lorenzo Camas our server. For dinner Delia was our hostess and Jaime, Juan and Antonio our servers. We rate them all in the excellent category. Sherly and Delia were so welcoming and gracious. The servers were so attentive, friendly and always very professional in serving us during our meal. We were so impressed that they seemed to really enjoy there work and conversing with foreigners \u2026they even remembered our names and looked forward to seeing us. The downside \u2026 just in case you think we are being too biased. The standard rooms are just that \u2026 they are adequate but have small shutter style windows with no views. For the extra money it is well worth an upgrade to a suite which is larger with terraces, views and sunlight. The evening entertainment was great \u2026 we loved the dancers \u2026 however the stage location near the pool is not great for the audience. It was much more exciting when they moved the stage into the hotel lounge on the cool evenings. In conclusion \u2026 the hotel provides an excellent service for many good reasons. Nevertheless for those world travellers it is not the \u201cRitz in Paris\u201d \u2026 however you always have to evaluate what you are getting for your money. In this regard it is of excellent quality and value for the cost. And worthy of its high rating.

Someone was always cleaning throughout the entire hotel. The rooms were very nice, spacious, quiet. The beds were extremely comfortable. We had a family room suite with 2 queen size beds and bunk beds. We didn't have kids with us on this trip, but I would imagine kids would love the bunk beds. Our view was beautiful and our balcony was enormous! I think the service at this hotel made the trip even more special. The waiters in the restaurants would do anything they could for you. One of the breakfast waiters named May, even went into the kitchen to make me oatmeal one morning because it wasn't on the buffet that day. On the beach, Pablo was incredibly entertaining as he brought us an endless supply of drinks! He's quite the dancer! With the exception of one guy at the front desk with an attitude, every employee at the hotel always had a smile and a kind word. The beach was very nice, with beautiful, white sand. There were plenty of chairs, so that was never a problem. Plenty of shade, too, if you didn't want to be in the hot sun all day. You had to climb over some sand bags to get into the water, but that really wasn't a problem. Once you got past those, the water was calm and great to swim in. We never sat near the pool, so I can't really comment on that. It looked nice. The food was okay. We liked the breakfast buffet the most. Dinner was a bit frustrating. The choices are a Mexican restaurant, an Italian restaurant or the buffet. You could get into the buffet just about any time, but the other 2 opened at 6pm and they didn't take reservations. There was always a line and unless you got there exactly at 6pm, there was usually a wait of an hour or more. The people staying at the Real next door could use our restaurants, but we weren't allowed in their hotel. That made ours very crowded. I think they could use a few more restaurants to accommodate all the guests. My last comment is about the location. Perfect! You could walk forever on the beach. It was about a mile to the Cozumel ferry, which we did one day. It's only a block to the main street, which has some fabulous shopping and restaurants. The shopping seemed to go on and on! I would definitely stay at this resort again. We felt safe the entire time. Lots of hotel security to keep an eye on things, but we never felt there was any danger.

The other days were at the buffet where you'll find quite a selection--you'll never be disappointed. I was expecially fond of all the vegetables.

A couple of times, we couldn't get them to swim or go to the beach because they wanted to stay at the kids club! \u2022The pool is very nice for novice kid swimmers with shallow ledges for those who really can't swim but also provide a nice easy out for the little ones that are just learning to swim. \u2022The activities are fun but not well attended. It seems many on vacation are not interested in salsa dance lessons, aqua aerobics, yoga or many of the other activities that we found enjoyable. This is the second resort where only one other person showed up for yoga with my wife. \u2022The beach stretches for miles and is great for shell hunting with the kids because erosion has left a 3 foot wall where the shells are literally \"for the picking\". The beach on The Royal side is better for swimming and wave riding. \u2022The food was good in every restaurant. In particular, the \"made to order\" stations in the buffet made the meals more like an a la carte restaurant than the buffet. The woman making omelets in the morning taught me a new and much better way to make them quickly for many people as happens in our family around the holidays. \u2022The shopping district was very close and included all the right shops for any tourist in our opinion. \u2022The service staff tried to be very attentive. The Bad \u2022The restaurant selection only includes two a la carte specialty restaurants and that is not enough for the 500+ registered guests. They don't take reservations and every night was a 40-60 minute wait for a table so that the girls never ended up eating. They fell asleep at the table. \u2022The service was good but seemed a little slow in the delivery of food and drink. The fault did not appear to be the wait staff but the rather the amount of wait and prep staff for the size of the crowds eating every night. \u2022They offer lots of promotions like spending your last nights at the Gran Real Caribe in Cancun so you are closer to the airport. But no one at the front desk seems to know how to get you into a comparable room. We were in the FJF with 2 full beds and a bunk bed with a trundle bed. They tried to put us in a room at the Caribe with one King bed and a roll away and thought that was a good deal. \u2022Getting our free swim with the dolphins and the half price off for the rest of the party was a 90 minute argument around the height of the kids but when we got to Dolphinaris, no one cared about the height and there were lots of kids the same size as ours! \u2022Getting a second cup of coffee with breakfast means literally chasing the wait staff with the coffee pots down. They should just put a pot on the table! \u2022The breakfast drink bar includes every juice imaginable as well as champagne for mimosas but no ice water. Getting a glass of ice water at the table is harder than getting a second cup of coffee and forget it if you want a second glass. The Ugly \u2022They really want to sell membership in their \"club\" which is just a different kind of time share. \u2022First they trick you into sitting down with someone to sell you on listening to the club presentation by offering you a \"gold card\" which gives you discounts in the gift store and on massages. This eats up more than a good hour of time that could have been enjoyed with the family. \u2022Second they assure you the presentation and viewing of the rooms at The Royal across the street will be no more than 90 minutes. \u2022Third it turns out to be a 2.5 hour event. The strange thing about The Royal for us was that we saw more Real Porto people being led around by sales agents than we saw guests! \u2022Fourth, the sales agents are sleazy. My daughter found the guy selling us rude, arrogant and uninformed and she told him so. When we mentioned the issue with getting a FJF at the Caribe, he disparaged the Mexican desk staff for being uninformed because \"they've probably only been working here for a week\". It's not a good thing to imply that your resort has a personnel turnover problem or that the staff are not bright. Bottom line: we thoroughly enjoyed our vacation, the pool, the beach, the food, the drinks, the trip to Dolpharis, our room but we all agreed that we would a) never go to another Real resort, b) never go to a resort that also sells time shares or \"club memberships\", c) never go to an all inclusive with only 2 premium specialty restaurants.", "Date": "November 30, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Vancouver, Canada", "Title": "\u201cThe best service from staff anywhere I have every stayed\u201d", "Author": "RTaylor82", "ReviewID": "UR88595775", "Content": "David in the lobby bar was my favorite bartender, Lorenzo in the buffet restaurant and also Benito in the buffet restaurant were all exceptional.

They all have an infectious charisma in getting, even the most laid back person to take part in some of the most funniest events they hold in the afternoon, such as Salsa dancing in the main pool and audience participation in the daily night shows. I recommend everyone staying in this resort to meet Philippa, which is 'Chicken's' alter ego on one of the show nights! Not to forget the tirelessly, hardworking waiters and waitresses who are ever so friendly and helpful in ensuring that your beverage is always topped up from strawberry dackerries to mojitos!

Opinions in comparison to previous vacations at Riu Playacar & Valentin nearby and Grand Velas, Club Velas and others on the Pacific Coast. My party consisted of 4 rooms of couples including one with a child. Every one of use had been to numerous all inclusives in Mexico on both coasts. We were immediately disappointed with our www.CheapCarribean.com booked jr suites. We were offered to upgrade and pay $100 a night for upgrades to an ocean facing room that would have included three dinners across at The Royal. My family got three rooms in the 101-110 range. My girlfriend and I transferred across the street to The Royal for $60 a night instead. My families stayed and their rooms had king sized beds, walk in showers with bench-ledge, a Chaise lounge , 'flat-screen TV' (not HDTV) with DVD player...and that's about it. A couple beers, Pepsi, club soda, chips, nuts etc. Nothing too impressive. The pool was quite small and under the bridge is a wall so you can't swim under it. No drinks in the pool which makes sense but I still like to have a drink in the pool. The pool bar sits on top of restrooms. Only made it to the pool on the roof with the swim up bar once about 3:30pm and it was about to close at 4pm and we were reluctantly served. The rooms we had all faced Constituyntes so at least get a room on higher floors to see the ocean to the east as the ground floor looks at taxis & commuters. The beach was disappointing, the 'water crew' refused us sailboats and kayaks and even boogie boards almost every time we asked even though the waves were never more than a couple feet high. The beach itself is a small area with a Volleyball net sitting about 6' above sea level next to a fairly steep walk down 6 or 7 layers of sandbags designed to combat erosion (see picture). It's not dangerous but it is imposing. You rarely see people in the water because it's a small area inside the buoys next to the fishing boats. You would never go running into the water from the sand. The water was actually closer to the building than anywhere else I've stayed so if you just like being close to the water without actually getting in you may enjoy this. The food and drink was maybe average. The couple of restaurants were ok but otherwise there's just the buffet which was not that good in comparison. The beach 'grill' doesn't have a grill and is really just a station of the buffet that workers roll out chafing dishes to periodically so it was not too fresh. Every restaurant offered lobster tail for an additional $29. At other all inclusives the food has been overall better. Push button cappuccino, no ice cream machine, no cutting station, no pool side or beach food delivery. For beer they have Superior, Dos Equis, Tecate and Coors light at some bars. Cocktails were often weak and margaritas come off the tap. We really enjoyed being that close to 5th street with all of the shopping, restaurants, and night life. There's a place right next door that has massages on the beach 2 for $45 for an hour, we liked Coco Bongo and Blue Parrot for a night out. We took the bike tour, went scuba diving, went to Tulum, and went to the Riviera Maya Jazz Festival as well.", "Date": "November 28, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "noord brabant", "Title": "\u201cheaven on earth\u201d", "Author": "widyse", "ReviewID": "UR88446628", "Content": "Just got back from 2 wonderfull weeks at the Gran Porto Real in Playa del Carmen.I could say it in one word FANTASTIC!!!

Would definately go back just to go back to PG Sandbox (1st Ave Calle 26 - about 5 mins walk away from the hotel) The Good Stuff We have been on All Inclusives to Egypt and this was by far the best holiday we have been on. The food was amazing, their is one main restuarant that serves brilliant breakfasts, lunches and Dinners with so much variety in the food (breakfasts were the best with pancakes, French Toast crispy bacon, smoked salmon etc) then their are two Al La Carte restuarants - 1 Italian and 1 Mexican. The other restuarants are more bar food than restuarants with burgers, hotdogs etc but the 24 hour bar/room always had nice food. We didnt partake in the entertainment side but the animation team work extremely hard and certainly kept everyone entertained - basically loads of activities are included in your package from bike tours through to snorkelling if you want to have a go and there is so much for kids to do! The rooms and hotel were kept so clean and you always saw someone cleaning - warning they do try to get you to upgrade and will put you in a different room for the 1st night, but we swapped the next day as we were already in a Junior Suite and didnt want to pay anymore for the same room with an ocean view as we were hardly in our room. We didnt get bothered once by the timeshare people which was brilliant but neither did any of the other UK guests - only Americans The Swings Bar and the main Pool bar were the best and served the best cocktails and a big thankyou to Miguel for always keeping our drinks topped up :o) The location of the hotel is great and we were so pleased we didnt stay on a big gated complex hotel - you are 2 minutes walk away from 5th Avenue and if you got bored of the hotel you just went out. So many good places to go but I would highly recommend the following: PG Sandbox on 1st Avenue Calle 26 - this place is a must if you are a Sports fan as they always had the Premier League on, American Football, Boxing - you name it, it was on or they would find it for you. The food and beer were fantastic and excellent value for money but the best were the staff - a big thankyou to Chris and Carrie and their gorgeous sausage dogs for looking after us El Diez Steak Restuarant - food was amazing here and very good value for money - go right down 5th Ave for about 10 mins and you will find it Bip Bips Restaurant - will remind you of Spain but the food is great and they always had 2 for 1 on cocktails!!!! The not so great stuff The staff at the hotel were friendly but places like the Lobby Bar the staff were just plain rude so we didnt go there. The beach isnt great but if you walk 1-2 mins either direction then the beach is great - they have built the beach up round the hotel but as the sea washed it away it did smell quite bad so we stuck to the pool which was great. The tours - Chichen Itza we didnt bother going as it was a 3 hour coach journey there so we went to Tulum instead which is only 30 mins away - great day out and would really recommend going but they start off trying to sell you evrything under the sun and force you into a jewellry store at the beginning and we got told off for staying outside - lets just say we told the tour guide where to get off!!! We also went on the Truck tour to Conzumel which again was brilliant but the ferry journey took 30 mins and people were throwing up all over the place but once you got there they took you to a nature reserve and the beaches are amazing - just be warned the snorkelling is hardcore swimming and not suitable for kids or not so experienced swimmers. The Spa at the hotel is ok but not worth the amount they charge - loads of other places outside of the hotel do great massages. Cost us \u00a347 each for a 50 min massage of which mine was good but my partner had a rather disinterested person that when he looked up she was reading a magazine with 1 hand!!!!

Our room was immaculate from the day we got there until the day we left. Magdalena did an awesome job keeping it clean and leaving surprises everyday. We also had the pleasure of meeting and talking with Miguel Domingoes, Pedro & Eddy who also were always cleaning and making the resort beautiful. The wait staff is really the people who make your stay wonderful. We spent our time on the beach and never went without a drink or being offered something. Pablo, Jose, Jesus, Cecilia, Mari, Claudia & Carolina are all really hard workers and deserve every tip they get! And we can't forget Teresa- she is the BEST!!! We spend any minute we can talking with her. We can't wait to see her next year!!! The towel service is also very handy. There was always someone there and you could trade in your wet towels as much as you wanted. Also Eduardo is the friendliest guy around. We always made sure to stop and talk to him everyday. Take advantage of the free water activites they offer. Like the boggie boards and kayaks. Tristian is very helpful and fun to talk to. Also beach volleyball, and the bike tour are fun. Victor and Miguel from the activites are lots of fun. The food here is also great. We never got tired of the choices the entire time we were here. Look for Ivan and Dion in Albatros (breakfast/lunch buffet) they will take good care of you and get you anything you need. Also find Trini at breakfast, she makes the best omelettes around!! Dinner in Albatros is also always good. Dehlia is the cutiest hostess and Benito is the best waiter. We always sat in his section. Ask for the Mayan Coffee, you won't be sorry. Maria's restaurant has a great menu and atmosphere. Ask for Domingo or Victor, they are great waiters. The beach snack bar is always good with hot dogs, hamburgers, chips & salsa. Daphni does a great job keeping it clean and stocked. And we can't forget the bartenders. Jose Be is our favorite and the one person we look forward to seeing every year. We just sit and talk with him as much as possible. Also Lorenzo and Brandy make awesome drinks at the pool bar. Miguel at the tradewinds bar makes the best Mojitos and really makes sure you have what you need. David in the lobby bar is also fun to talk to. Our check in and out went very smooth and got everything we asked for. Claudia was very pleasent. The bellboys were great, thanks Aaron for bring up all our bags. As far as the timeshare people, just ignore them and say no. All in all this is our most favorite place in the world and will be back next year.

A good Italian and Mexican restaurant. You did not need reservations for these - first come, first served. The dress code is quite relaxed as well - guys could wear shorts. The self-serve food on the beach was good too - hot dogs and hamburgers, pizza etc ... good for the kids. Maybe not as many food options, but if you like the feel of a smaller resort, this one is great. The staff were great - very friendly and accomodating.

My only knock on the Porto Real was the beach...the actual usable part was pretty small for a resort this size; they have had an erosion issue, and there were sandbags on the beach, and a steep drop-off to the actual water. At times, the sandbags left a foul odor to waft up to the resort pool area, which was very disappointing.

We had a great time. My 10th trip to the Carribean and my comments as follows. Check in: I will get this out of the way... after booking with the resort for three months, it was upsetting to get there and our room (standard) was not available. They try to force you in paying ($40/night) to upgrade to a Jr Suite and we did not want this. They put us in the suite room anyway and told us we had to move the next day. I am on vaction to get away from all the hassel and like to have my stay flawless. I tried to talk to the guy at the front desk. He just hit the bell on the desk and instantly the bell boy came and took bags and went with them to the room. Not impressed. The next day we were out enjoying our time and then when we came back to the room we were locked out and had to move in 10 mins. The bell boy came and packed up our stuff, underwear and all in the suite case and walked us out. We just needed some time to get our stuff together. We were put into a standard room that we requested and the room was nicer than the Jr Suite. Right by the adult pool and hot tub. We were happy with this and moved on to enjoy our stay. Room: Standard like a hotel room, nice big shower, fridge with pop, water and beer. It was nice to have a table and 2 chairs outside our room. No complaints with the room, maid was very good and room was very clean all the time. Phone rang alot, club membership people, check out person and room service people. I was not used to that on vaction. Food: Buffet had very good food, selection and freshness. The beach resturant was good and well maintained for burgers, hot dogs etc. Nice to have a snack. The 24 all inclusive room had good little sandwiches. The room service was very good and quick (10 mins). We did not go to the a la cartes. Pools: Very nice and clean. You could play sports or just lounge around. The adult/swim up pool (3rd floor) was under utilized. Good drinks there and hot tub on the roof top was great. Beach: Little rougher than I have seen before. Sand was very nice but no where to really swim. If you go a little ways to the north, it is much better. There was no sea weed and very clean. Nice place to tan or play beach volleyball. Service: This is an area that needs alot of praise. The staff at this resort is top notch and they work real hard. From the cleaning staff, to the waiters and bartenders, is what made our experience one we will never forget. Lorenzo and Brandy the bartenders at the oval bar were the best, they deserve every tip that they get. They engage the people and serve with a smile. The drinks were all very good and I hope they appreciate the 'blinky' glasses we left them. Others that were great were Migel at the beach bar and Ivan in the buffet, what a nice man. Other: No disco at this resort, bar closes at 11 pm. The self pour 24 hour bar was good and a nice place to hang out. Resort is one block from 5th ave for an easy stroll. You MUST go to Coco Bongo's (3 blocks from resort). This was a show you must see. Fantastic and the all included drinks just kept coming and coming. I highly recommend you go and see this. Free wireless internet at the hotel so you are able to talk to home if need be. Watch the trips you take, we went to Cancun to the Island and shuttle was 2 hours (3-4 drop pick ups) each way and made for a long day in the bus. There are closer trips and check out Cozumel. Our group had a very good vacation here. I will be recommending this resort to all my friends. The main reason was the service that was provided by all the hard working people there.

The hotel is pretty average. Originally my sister in law booked us in a standard room. The room was way too small for my 6'3\" husband. They had 2 double beds in the room and he couldn't fit his whole body in the bed. The 2nd night we upgraded to a King suite that was Ocean walk out. Much better room and more of what we are used to. The Ocean walk out view wasn't great. They have a ton of Cabanas blocking your ocean view. We did like the idea of our large deck with hammocks and easy access to the beach. But the staff stored all their lawn chairs in our corner. A few things were wrong with the room (fridge didn't work, drain clogged) but as soon as we told the desk they sent someone immediately to fix it. We were very impressed with this. The strange thing we found was that our maid would come and clean the room and make up the bed, then late afternoon we would nap in the room and then go for dinner. While we were out for dinner someone would come and toss chocolates in our unmade bed and not bother making up the bed. The water in our fridge only got replinshed twice. Having only 2 bottles of water each time wasn't enough for 2 people when its 30+ outside. The food is mediocre and the 24hour snack bar is barely worth mentioning. The choice of restaurants is limited and you had to wait a long time to get a table at the Italian restaurant. With our upgraded room we were able to use the amenities and the restaurants at the Royal across the street. This would be the ideal place to stay. Much nicer resort and the food is way better. If you get a chance to upgrade there you should do it. The rooms are bigger, and the pool is much better. Ocean walk out rooms don't have a ton of Cabana's blocking the view. Our room was at the end of the hallway. It was LOUD! We could hear all across the hallway while we were sleeping. The noise just carried so far. The staff are pretty good. The front desk was great. But there never seemed to be enough people working the desk for check in or check out. There was always a line up. There are 4 computers there but you have to pay for internet access. And there was no printer. People like to check in for their flights and print their boarding passes and couldn't do so. I love the location of being close to 5th Street but we are not resort people and would prefer more acitivities. Its pretty remote. About a 2 hour bus ride from any of the ruins and attractions. That's 2 hour one way! Cost was alot to partake in the tours as well. The hotel doesn't have a club onsite and the entertainment at night is sub-par. There isn't alot to do there besides lay on the beach or pool. You can only walk down 5th so many times. The EZ bar was great. They showed all the NHL hockey games so we spent alot of time there.

Astrid the concierge near the front desk, was the greatest, she really help us a lot and it was appreciated , muchas gracias Astrid!! The room we had was a oceanfront junior suite, wow! Worth the couple bucks more! The view was incredible, the room was huge and on the balcony we had a hammac which my husband loved. Like many people before us many are impress by the cleanliness, the beauty of the place and most of all the service, and they are right. I have to name a couple of them that gave us such good service: Pablo and Jos\u00e9 at Gaviotas on the beach (I will be coming back for my Whinnie the POoh!). Sherly, Ruby, Victor and Rodrigo at the Albatros, always happy to see us. As for our chamber maid, I can't remember her name but she was a sweethart, she left us everyday beautiful shaped animals on our bed. We were also very lucky weather wise, we missed by a hair a hurricane (Small hurricane Paula), All we got of that was a couple of hours of rain. The hotel was very responsable and was keeping us in the loop. The were prepared but nothing happened, the hurricane just changed direction and missed us completely. A couple of comments regarding food, time sharing and the beach: I am not the most picky eater in the world, so the buffet, even if it was sometimes repetitive, was good. They had something for everyone, even if the selections was not the biggest. The people behind the stoves must have been sweating like crazy but the smile and the service was always there (gracias Ruby!). If the buffet that night was not to our liking, we would go to any of the 2 restaurants that were available to Gran Porto Real guests. Mexican or Italian which were fine. We would have appreciated a couple more choices of restaurants, 2 weeks is a bit long with only a buffet and 2 restaurants, but being so closed to the main street (5th Avenue), the choice of restaurants is endless, you can very easily eat out. One thing that was missing is the self serve Ice cream machine at the buffet, we had to beg everyday to have some. PLEASE BRING IT IN SO THAT WE CAN ENJOY IT ANYTIME... As for the time sharing, they are indeed a pain in the neck, but just say no, even if its sounds like its the hotel that wants to talk to you and make sure 'your all inclusive is OK' Just run the other way! As for the beach, it is picturesque with its fisherman boats and sandbags. I liked it a lot, much calmer and less windy than our counterpart at the Royal. They take great care of it. I would recommend highly that you always wear sand shoes in the water, many corals and rocks but also many fishes, great for snorkeling! The water was usually very calm. So like I said earlier, I loved it so much, I am going back with my sister in April. This is a fun place, great for active people and hard to please people. So many things to do if you want.

This place really let us down, severely. First of all they put us in room 116 which is just off the lobby on the main floor by the 24 hour snack bar/bar lounge. It was extremely loud, people, kids walking by yelling, screaming. The following morning I went to the front desk to ask to be moved. They said it would cost us extra to move. I had to explain to the front desk agent that we would check out if they didn't change us to another room for free. The second room they sent us to was on the 3rd floor at the end of the hall way. Exact same type of room it was nice. Until we went back in the afternoon and the wind shifted. Down our hallway it literally stunk like someone or something had died and pooped all over the place. It was SO extreme - I have a pretty good stomach and it actually made me gag. I attempted to call the front desk however they didn't do anything about it so I walked down to the front desk and advised them. The same front desk agent said that we would have to pay to be \"upgraded\", again I told them it was the second time we changed rooms and that I wasn't going to pay. He said he would see what they could do and call me in my room. So I waited in my room for an hour, still nothing. So I went back and the supervisor finally came out. She got me to sign this little paper that said \"free upgrade\" I did and they gave me keys to our new room. It wasn't an upgrade, it was the exact same room, just on the opposite side of the resort. They said it was an ocean view but you really only had a small glimpse of the ocean if you looked from the balcony. It didn't stink so we were okay with it. Later that evening we went into the buffet restaurant and it stunk like an outhouse again! Whatever we smelt in our second room we smelt in the restaurant! The windows were all open and it was apparently coming from the beach. Seaweed or something like that washes up on the beach and rots, creating that god awful stench. I couldn't even eat! When they clean up the seaweed from the beach the smell gets worse. Literally one of the most disgusting stenches I've smelt in my life. On top of that when you check in the front desk asks you to go see these people around the corner to get your free present and information. They are all very nice but they will ask you to go and take a tour of the hotel across the street. DON'T! They will only waste your time, show you around and then bring you to another office where another person will try to sell you a part of their property until ROYAL CLUB. If you say no they are rude, tell you not to get upset and are straight up pricks about the whole situation. Do yourself a favour and don't bother, just say no. The food is not even worth trying to enjoy, the drinks are not made well, their beach sucks and there's always police out front with their lights on stopping someone or another. Do yourself a HUGE favour and stay at a proper all inclusive on its own property on the outskirts of Playa del Carmen. They are much better. I will never stay here ever again, I will also warn anyone I can to stay away!

Several of the staff have been there for many years and never forget their guests. Upon our arrival, we were greeted by the hotel Manager, Lynn and her Assistant Manager, Nicholas and Carlos Melgar, the Reservations Manager. Nicholas personally escorted us to our beautiful Ocean front suite. The rooms are gorgeous and spacious and Thelma did an exceptional job keeping the room spotlessly clean. Everyday, Thelma would have beautiful Towel art on the bed and in the bathroom. Each evening, they would come into our room and put chocolates at the bedside. The housekeeping staff work tirelessly and the resort is spotless inside and out. The pool at the hotel is large and there are lots of pool lounge chairs and also on the beach as well. Ciro, the \"pool man\" and Cruz keep the pool crystal clear. I was up very early every morning and they would be working so hard to ensure the pool was top-notch for the guests to enjoy for the day. The pool/beachside waiters are wonderful and very attentive, you will never wait for a drink for very long. I want to take this opportunity to thank the waiters who took such good care of us.....Alonso, Jose, Pablo, Jesus, Benitto, Margarita, Theresa, Elizabeth and of coase, lets not forget the bartenders who mix those wonderful drinks..Ancona, Lorenzo and David. You all do such a great job! The Activities team.....Mike and his staff, Cesar, Alejandro, Jesus, Patty and Alejandra who work tirelessly all day and into the evening to ensure all the guests are well looked after and entertained. There are several activities to participate in thruout the day in and around the pool and on the beach and each evening they host a wonderful show as well. We really missed seeing Victor this trip as he was on his well deserved vacation. To all of you......you do a great job! A special thanks to Jesus for the kayak journeys as he did all the work and I enjoyed the scenery! The food......it is amazing and delicious! We had breakfast and lunch at Albatros everyday. We were personally escorted to our \"favorite\" table by Delia and Edgar. They greeted us each time we arrived with a smile on their faces and May and Verlan looked after us at our table. Every morning we had a wonderful Omelet prepared by Triny. She is the Omelet Expert. She has worked at the resort for many years and always remembers us and has a smile for us every morning. The quality of the food is excellent and was enjoyed by all. Each evening we had dinner at Ile Pescatore, the Italian Resturant. We we greeted by Jose, our \"special\" waiter who has looked after us for the past 6 years. He took great care of us each evening. The food is amazing and the presentation of the food is exceptional. We had a Romantic dinner on the beach one evening and it exceeded all expectations. Eliazar took special care of us and tended to every detail. The dinner was delicious. Carlos Canela is the manager of all the resturants and he ensures that everything runs smoothly! Also, a special thanks to Franceso and Freddy for your wonderful friendship. It was great to see you.

Way better than on a cruise ship, where they sit in a warming tray for hours! And of course, Flor Rico, our Real Club rep, who contacted us several times before we arrived, who kept me informed of the weather, arranged for our ride from the airport and for her excellent presentation on the Real Club. We will be back to talk to you again! This hotel was SO CLEAN. Staff were always visible, doing everything from raking the sand around the beach loungers at 6 in the morning to dusting the corners in the hallways during the day. We felt comfortable and safe at all times at this resort. People are always writing about the beach here - let me tell you, I have been on all the so-called \"best\" beaches in the Caribbean, and this one is far superior as far as cleanliness, water quality and the ability to take a long walk. My husband and I thought the fishing boats added character to the beach, not detracted from it. And the small sand bags show a committment by the hotel to keep the beach from eroding even more. If you are super fussy, the beach at the Royal next door is as close to perfect as you can get anywhere. As far as being bugged by timeshare people at the Cancun airport, as soon as we said we had a ride, they left us alone. There were only about 5 people anyway, so this was no big deal as far as we were concerned. Even having our bags thoroughly checked (we pushed the button and got a \"red light\") was not as bad as we have experienced in some US airports. All in all, this vacation went off without any hitches and was thoroughly enjoyable. I would return to this hotel in a heartbeat!

At checkin, the receptionist tried to upgrade us to an ocean front room for $480 (1 week) but we had juts had a long flight and I though we already had an ocean view room. We were wrong, it was a partial ocean view. But that didn't matter because all we wanted to do was to hit the beach and start binging ourselves with margaritas and mojitos. But stay away from these reps as they are on the look out for new arrivals and they usually start by telling you about the hotel amenities and then slowly get you on the hook for a 90 minute breakfast tour of the adjacent hotel followed by an aggressive sales session by sharks who will make you feel like a loser if you don't buy into their $700/yr time share. The service was really great, friendly and fast. Everyone was smiling and the staff tried hard to entertain us. There were lots of daily activities from beach volleyball to biking. The beach was sub standard and had rocks and lots of sand bags. If you want to run and smash at the incoming waves then forget it. But a few minutes away on both sides there are very nice and clean beaches. The best part about this hotel is the location. It's right in the middle of playa del carmen and 2 blocks from the bustling 5th avenue. We really enjoyed this nice escape. Other hotels between playa del carmen and cancun or tulum have to take a 30 minute shuttle bus or a taxi to get to this nice little town. We recommend a great beach club called Fuzion at the end of 5th avenue (turn left just before the bus terminal). They had great live bands and frequented by locals.

On our last night, which happened to be my birthday too, they threw me a very special party in the restaurant, and went out of their way to coordinate a special menu with the chef, complete with appetizers, an incredible main dish, champagne, and they even got me a birthday cake with candles while the entire staff sang!

The staff make this hotel special - these are only a few of the special folks who will ensure your stay is fantastic. The hotel is wonderful. The management and the \"Club\" system leave a lot to be desired in terms of the complexity of the system and the lack of responsiveness. We had a weird and negative experience in that we paid a lot of money last year and \"joined\" the Club Real. When we tried to book the vacation through their office, we were mislead/misguided - having been told we'd get the best rates. Unfortunately, when we found cheaper rates online, and repeatedly contacted the \"Club\", we did not receive the matching rates, and we were informed if we booked the online cheaper rate we'd still be treated with full Club membership entitlements when we arrived. When we got there - with friends in two to whom we had recommended the hotel and membership - we were met with \"oh, no...you booked online through another company and therefore you forfeited your \"Club\" benefits. After paying an additional 1/4 each of what we paid online, we upgraded, and through a very unpleasant multi-hour complicated negotiation, we received very basic Club level membership. It was a HORRIBLE way to start the vacation. Given that we are out $9,000 paid for membership, we decided to make the best of it and treat it as a learning experience. We are not sure what will happen when we try to book our next trip. I can only hope it will be more pleasant and also that the Club will honor the matched lowest fares. The best I can figure, the \"Club Real\" only has a limited number of rooms in its own properties, and that if you do not get a reservation in one of their allotted rooms, then you are out on your ear, can book on the open market (at a lower fare), but you will thereby sacrifice being treated as a \"Club\" member. It's terribly complicated and feels like being dropped into a parallel universe. All in all we love the property, the staff, the food, the environment. However, we are less than impressed with the \"Club\" system and are wondering if the payment we made in joining is not simply lost at this point. I hope things turn around for the future. The only other bad experience was when I tried to offer two friends a drink on the beach. Within or two minutes a security patrol showed up from the hotel and made a scene. I had made it clear that we wanted to purchase drinks for the friends (who were staying at another resort in Playa), but we were told that was not possible. The security person got a manager and two more security guards within a couple of minutes (we were just sitting here post-SCUBA dive chill) and insisted that my friends leave the property immediately, or sit on the sand about 20 feet away on the other side of a volleyball court. We were all very calm throughout, and we were astounded, but very quickly moved down the beach where we dropped the $50 on drinks and snacks that we would have gladly spent at our own \"Club\". Only about 1/3 of the beach chairs were in use at the time, and all of the menus and drink lists at the hotel and its restaurants have prices (for the non-inclusive package guests), so we assumed we could purchase the drinks. The bottom line: we were all humiliatedand exasperated by the treatment and inflexibility, and this well-healed Dutch couple who had been interested in Club Real for future visits are needless to say very unimpressed. Bottom line: Great place...just learn the many rules, abide by them, and be prepared for inflexibility. I would suggest staying there (buying the best rates on the open market) and not paying the many thousands of dollars to \"join the Club\" unless you have tons of flexibility, patience, and very thick skin - and nearly $10K to throw at an organization that clearly has little interest in working with its members once the money is paid.

We left the husband and families behind and went for a girl's vacation. What stands out is the staff. From the moment we got there, the staff asked us our names and remembered them. They remembered what we drank and continually brought us drinks by the pool and beach. Special thanks to Teresa and Cecilia. They worked the pool and bar areas and couldn't have been friendlier. Every staff member there is great...too many to name. The pool towels guy, the waiters(Carlos) the bellboys, the front desk. They are trained well and take pride in going out of their way to help. The rooms are clean. There is a big difference between the oceanfront view and ocean view. We stayed in a jr. suite ocean view. Our room faced the Royal Hotel across the street and from the right-side of our balcony, you coul see the ocean. The ocean front is full view of the ocean facing the back of the hotel...the ocean, the beach, and the pools. The jr. suites are fantastic. Lots of room, good air-conditioning, very clean. The housekeeping staff keeps things very immaculate. Resturants are very tasty...I have been to other all-inclusives and have to say the food here was outstanding. Playa del Carmen is great. The hotel is within 2 blocks of the 5th Ave. shopping. Seemed like they preffered pesos, but had not trouble taking dollars too. The beach at the hotel was nice. There is a small portion that is rocky so be careful. I hurt my feet until someone told me to just keep walking several steps in the other direction. There, the beach was smooth with a few rocks. Very beautiful views and fun to swim. Pool was terrific. So was the bar with the swings and the pool on top of the third floor where there was a swim-up bar.The spa and workout areas are clean. I used the equipment every morning and had a great massage by Lucy-thanks! I had read other reviews and was prepared for the time-share pitch. We had just checked in and turned around to get our things, literally the guy was right in my face. Saying no was really a waste of time. He kept talking and walking in front of us. My friend finally had a pretty good smackdown with the guy telling him she was tired, hungry, and wanted to go to her room. After trying again, the guy said he would call later. My friend very forcefully had to say not to. They seemed to leave us alone after that. Be warned that they really don't take no for an answer.

We had never been to Mexico or been all inclusive before and didn't really know what to expect. We liked the idea of not having to carry money around all of the time, and all food and drink was included in the cost, but we were concerned that we might get bored with the choice of food after 2 weeks. We needn't have been concerned at all. The food was lovely in all of the restaurants, especially El Pescatore (Italian) and there was always a good varied choice in Albatross (buffet restaurant). Then you had the choice of a Mexican Restaurant (Marias) which again was lovely, and a sushi bar which we never went to. All in all we could not fault the food at all. The drinks were great too, a huge range of cocktails, all with a generous amount of alcohol in them, and plenty of ice cold Sol beer with lime. Now to the most important thing about this hotel, the staff. They were absolutely amazing and could not have been friendlier. There are too many to mention but the following people went out of their way to make our holiday extra special. Victor (Chicken), Mike, Cesar, Alejandro, Jesus, May, Eduardo (towels), Victor in Albatross restaurant, Alberto in the shop, Verlain in Albatross restaurant and Addy our room cleaner (who did amazing sculptures with the towels). The entertainment team (mentioned above) were fantastic and there was always something fun to do both day and night. We went on quite a few day trips and enjoyed them all. Try not to do the Tulum/Xel-Ha trip in one day, you really want a whole day in Xel-Ha to sample everything and get your moneys worth. Xplore was amazing and we tried the zip lines even though we were scared of heights. If you want to go horse riding through the jungle and then onto a deserted beach, try Rancho Baaxal as it was amazing and really good value for money.

I have no complaints with the hotel. Here is a summary of my thoughts: Room: I stayed in the junior suite ocean view. Upon check in they stated that all the upper level rooms were booked for the first night but would be available the rest of the stay. Sounded sketchy but I went with it. They lived up to their promise but there is no way that the upper rooms were full. The resort was empty and they allowed us to move at 10am the next morning. Either way, the room was large and the bed was comfortable. The shower was huge and the water pressure was powerful. Beach: The beach at the hotel is non existent. Erosion is hurting this resort. There was a steep drop off on the beach (4-5 feet before the water). A lot of sand bags. Once you get in the water it is really rocky and you can walk forever and the water does not get deep. I recommend exploring the other side of the boat dock (up the beach) about a 5 minute walk near the cement wall. The beach is great and the water was amazing. no rocks, great waves.. Food: The food at the buffet was better than average. Every morning we ate at the buffet and the food was great. The omelette station was delicious. The staff wasn't too eager to assist with coffee but once asked they were helpful. With a standard stay we could choose from two restaurants for dinner. The Italian food was good, my ravioli was under cooked but my girlfriends steak and potatoes was amazing. The second night we ate at the mexican restaurant. No complaints here. The other nights we ate off site. Drinks The bar staff was great but I question if the hard alcohol isn't watered down. Beers were delicios and bountiful. Staff: The staff was friendly and helpful.

My girl friend threw me a towel from the balcony.... that's how close our room is to the ocean...and the water is so clear ..you can see your toes when your up to your chin in the water...The staff at the Gran Porto are very professional and really seem to like making people happy...Room service, great food and drinks...Gran Porto Real....", "Date": "October 8, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Rotterdam, The Netherlands", "Title": "\u201cIt has been an excellent visit and everything and everyone was superb!!!!\u201d", "Author": "Vissie_10", "ReviewID": "UR82625180", "Content": "From the beginning untill the end full service, lots of entertainment, very friendly staff whom we laughed a lot with and the food and drinks were great!!!

I was ecstatic about the location in reference to the strip as we would not have to plan a day excursion to go shopping or check out the local bars/restaurants. We had purchased the Junior Suite, but decided to upgrade to the ocean front room when we arrived, which was totally worth it. Our balcony gave us a gorgeous view of the pool area and the beach. We could even see the ships at Cozymel about 20 miles across the ocean! The hotel is well kept and very clean. Maids and workers were seen constantly mopping, cleaning, and painting to keep the hotel looking pristine and each would provide you with a kind smile, \u201chola.\u201d Our room was on the third floor overlooking the beach and pool area and was well stocked with an in-room bar as well as drink mixers. I was pleasantly surprised that the room even had a DVD player. The king-sized bed was comfortable and the room spacious enough for the three of us. They provided a cot for our son to sleep in too at no extra charge. The bathroom has a large walk-in shower complete with a laundry line to hang your wet suits. The food at Gran Porto Real was excellent. They have 8 different food options. 1) The Albatros restaurant is buffet style open for breakfast, lunch, and dinner. Typically, they offered traditional Mexican flavors (not your typical tacos and fajitas). There are 2 grill stations that would offer different items grilled fresh. They always had a section for vegetarian dishes too. 2) The Gaviotas is located on the beach by the pool and is also a buffet style with typical American food for lunch like hot dogs, hamburgers, and French fries. There is a 24-hour snack-food restaurant located off the lobby with drinks and mixers available at your leisure. 3) Maria\u2019s is a sit-down traditional Mexican restaurant only open for dinner. The food here is good, but the portions are tiny. The good thing is, with all-inclusive, you can order as many items as you like. 4) Il Pescatore is Italian and was our favorite restaurant. Only open for dinner, this restaurant serves fresh baked pizzas, pasta, shrimp, fish, and chicken dishes. My favorite was the Shrimp Risotto, while my wife\u2019s was the ravioli. The pizzas are phenomenal there too. 5) There is a Sushi Bar located at the \u201cprivate rooftop pool\u201d. This was tricky to find, but since it was off the beaten path, not many people chose to hang at this quiet pool and bar. The sushi was pre-prepared rolls of various types and was really tasty. 6) Room Service is available twice/day per room. The menu is slightly limited, but when we did order it, the food was tasty. Sometimes it did take a while for the food to make it to the room. 7) The Beach-side private dinner is an additional fee, and we did not partake in this option as the all-inclusive options were plenty for us to choose from. 8) The Lobby area had coffee machines with biscuits, cookies, and other small sandwich-type snacks for nibbling. There is a main pool area with two pools separated by a walking bridge. This area was nice as both pools had a toddler section that was only about 1\u2019 deep. There were bartenders constantly checking to see if you needed drinks or anything else. The beach offered cabanas at first come first serve, which were nice to have to stay out of the sun all day. The entertainment was ongoing throughout the day including water aerobics, trivia games, bingo, and other activities hosted by the spirit staff. They also offer twice a day bike tours through private neighborhoods and to some Mayan ruins. The Water Sports offers kayaks, sailboats, and snorkeling every day. Gran Porto Real offers a daycare open every day for ages 4-12. The kids would make crafts, play games, play on the playground, or watch movies. The staff there was very courteous and the kids always had a good time. They also offer night-time babysitting for a small hourly fee, where a babysitter comes to your room while you go out and enjoy a romantic dinner or night on the town. They also offer a teenage room filled with flat-screen televisions and every game system imaginable. A travel agency is on site to offer many different excursions including ATV Rides (a must), XCaret (an adventure park with zip lines, rafting, and other outdoor activities), Mayan Ruins of Tulum guided tours, and many more. Many Mexico resorts are off the beaten path, secluded, and require taxis or shuttle services to get into downtown for shopping. This all-inclusive resort is in the perfect location for families who don\u2019t want to plan for shopping or seeing the city. We would definitely recommend this resort to anyone looking for an all-inclusive Mexican vacation.

The hotel is very clean and beautiful. We had a super cute, super small standard room with a king size bed. The staff was friendly and helpful and the location in proximity to 5th Ave was unbeatable. The cons were the food and the beach. Where the food is concerned, for the amount of money we paid, I was definitely expecting more variety. There were so many repeats that by the third day I was bored and tired of seeing the same vegetables, the same 5 desserts, etc. The specialty restaurants were also just okay. Eating at each once will just about do it. The menu selection did not change which was a real disappointment, especially when it came to the desserts. It would have been nice to have something other than the same 3 choices. The beach was pretty to look at but there are a TON of large rocks and stones under the water making it IMPOSSIBLE to walk out in the water and not hurt your feet or bang your shins. Whenever I went for a swim in the sea, I would tell myself that if I keep walking out eventually the water would deepen and I would not have to worry about the rocks . . . unfortunately, that never happened.

Bathroom was small the sink was outside of the bathroom. Our so called balcony had 2 chairs in the hallway facing the street. The bed was a lil. hard. We were offer to upgrad to a suite for $20us more a night but we declined. Rather spend that $ on shopping or sightseeing. Location is perfect just 2 short blocks from 5th ave. Beach was a little rocky, not as clear and kind of smelled but we walked 5 mins away and found the perfect beach spot. All the drinks are great they have name brand liquor, beer on tap is Dos XX, they do have Tecate Light n a can but u have to ask for it. The swim up bar was small but I perfered it better then the main pool. Jose @ the swim up bar was on top of things never once had to ask. The bars all seem to close by 11pm and there is no club on site. There is a room with snacks, tap beer & liquor open 24hrs. Food was ok kind of got burnt out after the 3rd day seemed to have same varity of food each day. We had a chance to go to Maria's and it was just ok. But they did have great chicken tortialla soup. We had a 25 min massage they were wonderful. The spa is $13us but when we went it was 50% off making it $7.50us per day. They gave us an offer to go to the sister hotel in Cancun The Gran Caribe for free with transportation and so we did for the last 4 nights. The hotel is a lot more fancy and double the size. The beach there was perfect but they had no swim up and the 2 pools were smaller. They have a water park area with 2 big water slides that adults can use and boy did I have a blast on them. The food here was a lil. better. Maria's you had to make reservation were @ GPR you didn't. The lobby bar stood open till 12 am and they had a live band each night but again no club on site. All rooms are suites so they were roomy and nice. Here they only had Dos XX on tap but all other liquor was the same as GPR. The taxi ride to the ferry going to Isle Mujeras was $15us one way. The night life in Cancun was not with in walking distance. I would say its a 10min drive or shorter depending on the taxi driver. Both resorts had security day and night so we felt safe. 5th ave even felt safe. Not once did we see anything out of the ordinery. If you want to use the internet it's $1us for 10min. I liked GPR better cuz its walking distance to 5th ave. You could walk to town for shopping, dinner or drinks without paying a taxi. We were also able to walk along the beach from GPR to the Cozumel ferry. Just wished GPR beach was better and would make this resort 100%. Both resort are wonderful and would recommend to everyone.

No way were we going to pay extra to stay in this room it was on the inside of the hotel, overlooking the air con units that supplied all the hotel. The food was average I was very disapointed,If you could speak fluent Spanish and knew what to ask for then you were OK otherwise you had to guess that what was on little signs in front of the food trays was all that there was, when in fact if you spoke to the short order chef he produced other thing from behind the counter. The beef was an experience in itself, it was so tough to eat that you needed teeth like razors to bite through it, that was of course proviiiding you could cut through it in the first place. The main hotel eatery was not my most favourite place, the Italian was very good and the Mexican was also nice, Saying all that you can't please all of the ppeople all of the time.. Oh and where was the ice cream, never saw one all the time we were there. The standard rooms are very standard, and the hotel try to push you into upgrading to other rooms. The standard rooms have no balcony and then to add insult to injury, they removed the table from outside our room. so when we sat out there was nowhere to put your drink only the floor The hotel security is slightly overboard, one day I felt like I was being stalked by one of the security guards, walking behind me and speaking into his radio while writing things down on his clipboard, very un-nerving. The positive side. The sushi bar pool was my favourite place, Jose` is a little gem. When us lot and the 12 American ladies from St Louis & Kansas City were there, he worked like a trojan and never lost that lovely smile. Will miss the guy.

My flight arrived into the Cancun airport at 10:30am and I had luggage in hand and was sitting in the Lomas van within 15 minutes of landing. Lomas had me walking into the hotel lobby at 11:45am and I was ready to get to the beach/pool. I didn\u2019t think that my room would be ready since check-in is 3pm but I was pleasantly surprised to learn that it was! Oh happy days! I had \u201cchecked-in\u201d online the day before and it asked me for my airline, flight number and arrival time so maybe that helped. While I was waiting for the key the bellman brought me a glass of Champagne to sip and then he escorted me to my room which was a Gran Jr. Suite Beachfront walkout. He walked through the room with me and showed me all the features/amenities and asked if I had any questions. He also pointed out my private palapa on the beach and said that it was marked with a sign the said: \u201cReserved for Suite 135\u201d. After he left I practiced the sport of \u201cspeed changing\u201d, grabbed my bag and hit the beach! The remainder of the report I will break into categories. Rooms: I was fortunate enough to book an upper level suite and I would do it again in a heartbeat! The room was spacious, clean and well maintained. The air conditioning unit worked so well that I had to burrow under the covers at night. Also, the in-suite refrigerator kept everything ICE COLD which was a surprise based on my experiences at other resorts. The closet was fairly spacious with an in-room safe (numerical pad), iron and ironing board and 2 robes and slippers. The bathroom was large and spacious with a HUGE shower. The water pressure was phenomenal and I always felt I got all the soap out of my hair\u2026\u2026.I know the men won\u2019t appreciate that as much as the women. \uf04a I brushed my teeth everyday with the water from the tap and never once felt sick. The entertainment center in the room came complete with a 32\u201d flat screen television which I believe had satellite television since I got a lot of channels (English speaking I might add) including 2 or 3 HBO channels. There was also a Bose docking station but it would not \u201ccharge\u201d the IPODS and I didn\u2019t bring my charger since I assumed the docking station would take care of it for me. No biggie though! One of the drawers in this center was my liquor cabinet with full bottles of Jose Cuervo, Johnnie Walker Red, Barcadi Rum, and two other liquors that I am having a hard time remembering. The room service staff was stellar! My room was generally cleaned somewhere around 9-11 since I was out of my room by 8am every morning. The Room Service staff took care of restocking my refrigerator everyday and then turndown service happened around 8pm. Bars and Bar Staff: There are 3 bars at the hotel aside from the ones located at the a la cartes. The lobby bar is a great treat to sit and take in the action, both inside and outside, if you were tired of being out in the sun. The beach bar (Gaviotas) is located at the pool but the hotel employs so many servers that you never have to leave your seat, either beach or pool, before someone is asking if you need a new drink. By far the best drink service that I have ever experienced! The quiet pool has a pool bar and it also serves sushi around 11:45ish. My favorite was the beach bar but that was where all the action was taking place. There is a 24 hour lounge that is self service and has snacks, beer, wine, champagne, soda, coffee machine, and top shelf liquor. This lounge also houses 4 computers that your can purchase minutes for\u2026\u2026$1.00 for 10 minutes. Food: Albatros \u2013 This is the buffet restaurant and it is typical of most AI\u2019s with regards to variety and types of food served. I ate here every morning for breakfast, twice for lunch and once for dinner. I feel that even picky eaters could find something to tickle their fancy. Parrillada Grill \u2013 This is the beach grill that serves nachos, hamburger, hot dogs etc. while you are lounging around the pool. Typical snack shack food. Room Service \u2013 The first night that I arrived I was so tired from my early flight/lack of sleep and then 5 hours of sun that I ordered room service and was asleep by 8pm. \uf04a The room service meal was delivered by Nairobi who also delivered fruit and wine to me earlier in the day. The dinner menu has around 6-7 entrees ranging from burger \u2013 tacos; it has soup and salad on the menu as well. Il Pescatore \u2013 This is an indoor (air conditioned) Italian restaurant. The menu includes pricing since it is open to the public as well as the hotel guests. I had a Caprese Salad as a starter and then the Salmon as the main course and tiramisu for dessert. My drink of choice was red wine but the waiter brought me a \u201cspecial\u201d drink which was a chocolate martini. Stellar service! At each of the a la cartes I had 2 people waiting on me since the work in teams. Maria\u2019s \u2013 This is an outdoor restaurant that services Mexican food. The night that I ate here the weather was very nice with a breeze so I was very comfortable. I had the Tortilla soup as a starter and the Enchiladas as my main course. The food was very good! I was pleasantly surprised my entire stay with the food and beverage quality. I skipped dessert this night so I don\u2019t even know what they offered. Pools: The quiet pool is located on the third floor of the hotel and has a pool bar. It is mainly an adult\u2019s pool but a few kids went swimming with their family one day that I visited that pool. I chose not to frequent it too often because 1) I like to be close to the action and 2) I watched a newlywed get snookered and hurl all the Miami Vices she consumed all over the pool deck. No offense but I don\u2019t find that behavior fun to be around. The main pool is where all the action is from water aerobics to salsa lessons to pool volleyball. There were not that many children while I was visiting but I believe that is because school had started again. I also want to mention that this resort takes great precaution for guest safety at the pool/beach. There are always around 4-6 lifeguards, and quite possibly more, patrolling the area. Beach/Ocean: Ok, this might be the only semi-negative of the whole resort. The beach does in fact have a 1-2 foot drop-off to the ocean, however, they plowed a section to allow for a gradual slope into the ocean. The ocean was very shallow for quite a ways out but it was rocky. There are numerous boats tied up to the right on the beach. One day, due to an obscene amount of seaweed you really couldn\u2019t swim in the ocean. They brought out a tractor of some sort and started to remove it. I have no idea what they did with it after that. Spa Real/Spa Azul: The spas, at both the Real and the Royal, were very nice and for some unknown reason all their services were 50% off. I had an Emergency Sun Treatment one day at the Spa Real and it cost $25.00. I then had a pedicure at the Spa Azul and it cost $24.00. I can say it was well worth it for a little pampering!!! I must say that I would go back to this resort again! What an amazing experience that I had in this paradise. I would also like to comment that I never had any qualms or reservations about visiting solo and I felt safe the entire time! If anyone has any questions please feel free to PM.

Another night they made a heart from bath towels on the bed with flowers, then they made a swan... and another night two swans kissing and making a heart... all with flowers! One of the simplest, but cutest things they did was go in our rooms in the evening and left a hershey mini candy bar with a note that said \"We hope you have sweet dreams.\" So yeah, great service!! We were always greeted by everyone that worked there. They would stop and ask us how we were doing, and about where we were from, etc... definitely making we knew we were important to them, and felt comfortable. Our room was great... it was cozy and always well kept! We even had a mini bar and a mini fridge with sodas and beers that we had access to included in our all inclusive package. Several of their employees stood out! Mind you, all of them were super friendly! Tips are included in the package (you may tip extra if you want) but what I liked most is that they didn't lounge around waiting for you to tip more... most of the time they were gone before you could even do so. There is poolside bar service too. Pablo (one of the outside waiters) even learned our name and was super attentive! Besides that there is a sports and entertainment team that made sure we were always having fun! They even would bother me and my husband and have us participate in some games they do! They did bicycle tours, kayaking, snorkeling, volleyball, etc... again, all included! Victor (aka Chicken) and Cesar were more than just attendants, they literally befriended us from the first night and were always super cool and nice. The restaurants were pretty good, our favorite was the italian one... by far the best waiter there was Israel! If you decide to do a tour (not included), I recommend doing the Rio Secreto. It's a underground cavern/river... a beautiful and amazing experience and its actually one of the cheaper tours too. I am honestly not doing justice to the hotel in this review. I will definitely return and recommend this place. It's even nice if you have kids because they have kid zones, so even when we expand our family...we can still stay here. The ONLY complaint I have is the TV. It's out dated and the reception isn't all that great... but then again if your vacationing in Mexico you shouldn't be watching tv!! Another convinient thing about the hotel's location is that it's walkign distance from some place street much like a South Beach/Saks 5th Avenue in NY. There are stores, more restaurants, and even night clubs! So it's pretty cool not to have to worry about taking a taxi to go shopping. Even though the hotel itself has a giftshop, and sometimes I noticed they had better prices than the other stores in the area...

The best part of the experience was the staff members at the hotel, especially Chicken, Cesar and Julio. They were respectful, helpful and fun. A big thank you to those guys! There was always some kind of entertainment or activity to join throughout the day: volleyball, pool games, water aerobics, dance lessons, water sports, bike tour, salsa band (excellent), nightly outings, etc. The themed night shows were awesome too! The dancers were amazing. Coco Bongo is a must!! The only thing I wished was different was our beach. It had a lot of seaweed and coral, so it was hard to swim right there. Although, just down the beach there were better swimming areas, so it was not that big of deal. I would most definitely recommend this hotel.

We chose to have a destination wedding with some of our closest friends and family and we knew Playa del Carmen was the perfect spot. After reading countless reviews and just taking a leap of faith, we decided on the Gran Porto Real (mainly because it was kid friendly and wouldn't break the bank for some of our friends and family). Major perks of this resort: 1. The resort is located right in the middle of the city with close proximity to shopping and bars/clubs. Most of our friends that attended were between the ages of 24-32 so it was very convenient having a wide selection of bars at night to entertain everyone. 2. The resort is very kid friendly. Other than our group of 60 people, there was another wedding there that also had several children between the ages of 5-15 and it always seemed like there was something going on for everyone at all times of the day. My nephews had a blast playing in the pool and going to the beach! 3. The food at this resort was honestly much better than I expected it to be - I've stayed at other all-inclusive resorts before and the food here was much better than previous experiences. 4. Most importantly, the staff was AMAZING!!! They always say the month before your destination wedding is when most of the stress will hit you and it definitely did, but once I arrived and met with Michel Madrid (pronounced Michelle) at the Wedding Center, all of my nerves were put to bed! She made every vision I had come to life and the entire event turned out better than my husband or I could ever have pictured it. Eduardo, the head waiter for our private reception on the beach, was amazing! He made sure the event kept running and everyone was having a good time. Even if you had the smallest request, he made sure it happened for you. The rest of Eduardo's staff was great as well - Samuel and Alberto. After the dancing had started, we even managed to get them out on the dance floor with us for a number or two. Eduardo and Samuel even hosted our private romantic dinner for two the next night and the amazing service just continued. The DJ did an amazing job - we just sent him a list of music we liked and the rest of the night went by request and he filled in the gaps with more fun dancing music. All in all, it was a perfect week and I will remember it always. It's a great place to go for the family, large group, singles and couples (if you don't mind children). The Royal, their sister hotel located directly across the street - they even share the same beach and most of the wedding sites, is adults only and I'm sure the amazing service continues there as well.

We booked with First Choice. The staff are helpful to the extreme and were always asking if we needed anything. We had a standard room just above the 'tranquil pool' and it was perfect for our needs. We were asked if we wanted to upgrade when checking in but we declined. We did the \u2018sales visit\u2019 to the Royal. It took 2 hours from start to finish and wasn\u2019t that bad! Just keep saying no at the end then collect your reward of a $500 peso voucher, photo frame and beach bag! The food in the main restaurant was good and varied, we could also eat at the Italian or the Mexican restaurants as well as lunch at the beach place that served burgers, pizza etc. The pool was very popular as they held activities there daily, you could watch without getting involved if you wanted. We had no problem getting a sunbed at any time of day. The Tranquil Pool was often anything but tranquil! It has a pool bar and there was a particular group that loved this pool and the free alcohol - the pool was often very loud ...... but they were on holiday and enjoying themselves and it was only open during the day. The entertainment was good and we used to watch this before our evening meal as it was over by about 9.15pm. Guests were often asked to participate but a polite 'no thanks' was gracefully accepted. I also did the bike tour which was good but the guide didn't give any info about the areas we cycled through until we got to Playacar. The beach was a bit disappointing but we'd read other reviews so this wasn't surprising. There is a drop in the sand but that didn't bother me - the seaweed, the occasional hidden rock, the murky water and the shallowness did. It wasn't good for swimming but OK for cooling down. If you turn left and walk past the pier, the beach is much better - another couple informed us that if you walked along that beach to the next one, it was even better. The Spa - I had a mud massage and my daughter had a Sun Saver massage. The massage experience was lovely and we then had the use of the spa for the rest of the day. The massage was expensive but worth it - we also used the spa facilities without a massage another day due to tropical rain, this cost $15 for the whole day. The hotel is perfectly placed for shops, bars and nightclubs without being too close. The shop owners will ask you in and if you say that you'll come back later in your stay, they will remember you and hold you to your promise! Most stuff isn't particularly cheap but I suppose you have to bargain - being British I didn't find that too easy so I bought very little! We did lots of trips and I'll post reviews on the relevant pages later - but briefly:- Mayan Encounter with Alltournative Tours - excellent! What an adventure and good value for money. Swimming with Whale Sharks with Blue Dream Diving - fantastic experience. I wouldn't bother unless you really want to see the sharks - it's expensive and a really long trip but sooo worth it if you are that way inclined like me! Sealife Discovery Plus at Peurta Aventuras - the animals are fantastic, sadly the whole experience wasn't - a real money making affair. I'm not sure what other places are like but I wouldn't recommend this one. Formula 1 tour booked through Playa Info - OMG, what an adventure! All done in the most spectacular thunderstorm and we swam with turtles too - thoroughly recommend this one! Snorkelling Adventure booked with Best Day at the hotel - lovely trip, worth the money (we saw a wild croc on the way back which took my breath away). Xel Ha - lovely! Worth the money but don't bother buying biodegradable sun lotion in town even if the pharmacist say's so - apparently it's not good enough. They do give you free sachets of their stuff though (my daughter is pale skinned and it didn't work well even though we applied it regularly \u2013 hence the afore mentioned sun saver massage!). Money \u2013 I took Dollars and Peso\u2019s. I changed money before the trip but the exchange rate on my credit card was better! Withdrawing cash had a fee but it was very useful having an ATM in the lobby. Sun lotion \u2013 take a high factor. I didn\u2019t sunbathe as such but did lay under the canopies on the beach \u2013 they take away a lot of the suns strength but you can still burn through them if you\u2019re pale skinned like us. Tipping \u2013 I tipped on all trips apart from one. I didn\u2019t tip at the hotel until the last day and I still had excellent service. One more thing \u2013 my suitcases put on weight as well as me! This is the first time I\u2019ve been charged for excess baggage - \u00a315 per kilo. They are hot on this and there is no escape unless you unpack your suitcase at the check in desk and transfer weight to your hand luggage. My tequila wasn\u2019t such a bargain after all. Apparently there is no ban on liquids in your hand luggage in Mexican airports (if I hadn\u2019t wrapped and buried the stuff in my case I\u2019d have saved a small fortune)!

The breakfast buffet was very good, as was the grill by the pool/beach, and dinner at the buffet was decent. One of my main complaints was that you couldn't have any drinks in the pool (only the adult pool on the 3rd floor). Also, the main pool didn't have a swim-up bar, but the service was excellent, and I never had to wait to get a drink. The waitstaff and all employees of the hotel were very friendly. The beds were a little hard, but I've heard people have that complaint about a lot of resorts in Mexico and the Bahamas. All in all, we were very pleased with our vacation.

No room for a couch (only 2 hardish chairs with a little bitty table), just 2 firm beds, big open shower-no tub. I liked the room Food: Always fresh, Kinda so-so. I had to eat buffet food until the evening. The buffet room was very hot with no AC, you had to get used to eating in the heat. The buffet was better than most but I would give the buffet 2 stars and could not say yuck, just kind of ho-hum. Service was good in the dinning rooms and they kept those tables clean, the only problem was when my glass got empty, they looked at the empty glass as something to clean off the table instead of something to fill. On average, I had to ask for more to drink; 7 or 8 times for every time I was asked. The night time dinning food was hit or miss but the service off the charts. There is a mexican and an italian dining room,. food was 2 to 3 stars, very typical for all inclusive. The steaks at an all inclusive are not going to be all that good anywhere.. If you crave a good steak, pay for one on 5th ave. the fancy Italian place: Not like the olive garden, it was a mexican version of italian. lacked any strong pesto or real italian flavors but had it's own nice seasoning . the pesto margarita pizza came out as a red sauce thick bread pizza with just a tiny bit of regular ole mexican white cheese. For the most part, the kitchen did really well for what they had to work with. great presentation. The fancy mexican: Get the fish it was the only 4-5 star plate served in the 6 days we where there. it was a toss up of which dinning room was better. we never set our expectations too high and enjoyed both of them both. Pool: No swim up bar, no drinking in the main pool but you could drink on the side of it. The all adult seclusion pool had a nice swim up bar and some sushi (don't expect real sushi, expect california rolls and good stuff like that in a cold buffet chest). Bars: outdoors you got dosxx on draft, no light beer to speak off. it was good fresh beer. The mixed drinks where great. At the bar in doors, you could get a mexican light beer. The house red was from spain and good. snack bar: excellent drink selection but poor food selection. Lobby and hallways: hot-hot-hot, no AC, I sweated from the time out the door until I jumped on the pool. Kids club: My 4 year absolutely loved it. Something you need to know: You may not leave the hotel if your child is in the kid club unless you hire another baby sitter for $12 an hour. I had no problems with that at all. Very good kids club! Gym: like a comfort inn, not all that great but good enough, had a bike and treadmill with AC. the dumb bells stopped at 50 pounds. no way to do any pulls. low-rent machine weights Location: That's why I am coming back, it's right there in the middle 5th ave. There is no other all inclusive resort that is waling distance from 5th ave. hope that helps and I can't wait to go back.", "Date": "July 17, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "KC", "Title": "\u201cThe BEST choice for all-inclusive in Playa del Carmen\u201d", "Author": "KcDoglover", "ReviewID": "UR71060865", "Content": "My family of five just returned yesterday from our second visit to the Gran Porto Real and I know we'll be returning in the future. In fact, my oldest daughter is planning to get married there next summer. Sorry this review is so long, but I just can't say enough about this resort and town. SERVICE: The service you'll receive at this hotel is top-notch. Every single person you come in contact with is smiling and seem to only have one goal and that is to serve hotel guests. At check-in, we were pleasantly surprised when Erika gave us a room upgrade to ocean-view rooms. Our maid, Ana Mateo, always left the rooms shining and a pleasure to return to after hours spent in the hot sun at the pool. While at the pool, we were very lucky to have Jose treat us as if we were his own personal guests for the week. The folks in the casual buffet always seemed eager to help, whether it was finding an empty table or filling an empty coffee cup. Our favorite place to eat dinner was the Italian restaurant. The hostess, Pamela, worked very hard to get everyone seated as quickly as possible. We were lucky enough to be seated at one of Mateo's tables because this guy knows what he's doing and always seemed happy to see us. I must also mention Alex who assisted Mateo with our meals. There are many employees I could mention, but then this review would never be finished. Let me just end by saying that everyone was extremely friendly and always willing to pause and answer my questions and patiently help me practice my pathetic Spanish. I would also like to add that we are in the habit of tipping when receiving excellent service. Some will say that since the hotel is all-inclusive, you shouldn't have to tip anyone. During our week we saw many guests who did not tip and I wasn't able to discern a difference in the level of service. For us, tipping is just something we always do and include them in the price of our vacation. ROOM: The rooms can best be described as oppulent, or maybe elegant. Look at their website to see for yourself. LOCATION: The main reason we first chose this hotel was because of its proximity to 5th Avenue. A very short walk, perhaps two blocks, and you're there. Our three daughters are 20, 21 and 24 and we felt very comfortable allowing them to explore the town on their own, as long as they remained together. We aren't stupid. They did find it uncomfortable when walking past the stores and young guys would shout out invitations to come shop. Differences in culture. I myself enjoyed the attention and never minded being called \"sweetheart\" in the hopes I would spend a few pesos. If you are in the market for jewelry and not the type found in souvenir shops, please stop in a small shop owned by Salvador. You'll find him on the same street as the hotel just a few store-fronts before reaching the corner. I found him to be very honest and not pushy. LIKED BEST: The hotel and all the employees; location very close to 5th Avenue. It's also kind of small when compared to resorts where you need a shuttle to get around the property. LIKED LEAST: Small things really-we would like to be able to swim in the evening but the pool closes around 9 pm. It would also be nice to have your drinks while standing or sitting around the edge of the pool. We got around that by purchasing water bottles at Walmart. The beach directly in front of the hotel is not the best. A small walk in either direction will bring you to beautiful sandy areas and gorgeous, clear water. Like I said, this review was long but there are so many good things to say about this hotel.

Positives: The food was good, not great, but plenty of it. The coffee machine coffee was good. Try the Italian restuarant, it was great. The entertainment saves the place. Nightly shows that are truly well done. The staff did a great job of providing many fun activities throughout the day. Very talented and well run. The hotel staff were very nice and friendly. Always there to get you something it seemed. Negatives: This place is older and a bit run down IMO. No way its 5 star. There are no on site grounds and is quite small considering the number of rooms it has. The beach is horrible. it smells most of the time with a constant battle of machinery removing seaweed. Lots of rocks in the water just off the beach to avoid. The beach is tiny and sandwiched between a long pier with ferry boats and a bunched of fishing boats tied up to the beach. Your view of the ocean is dominated by the boats. If you reserved a \"ocean view\" room, you will be in a room that backs up to the street and you have to look down the street to see the ocean. A true ocean view room is what they call their \"ocean front\" room. Different price. The pool is always packed and is way too small. Its really loud and for me, hard to relax. I went down to get a spot at the pool at 7:30am one morning and they were all long gone. People just put their stuff on the chair and go back to bed. The \"tranquility\" pool on the 3rd floor designated for adults is nice but usually has screeming kids jumping in and out. Bottom line: If you are expecting a new look/feel resort with huge beautiful grounds and multiple large pools and a great \"Corona commercial\" type beach, go somewhere else. If you want to go somewhere with a friend for 2-3 nights...and you get a screaming good deal, then knock yourself out.", "Date": "July 13, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Cortland, ohio", "Title": "\u201cGreat time, Great Resort!!\u201d", "Author": "AnnaBanana64", "ReviewID": "UR70697640", "Content": "There is not enough good to say about this resort. We stumbled upon this resort after initially being in their sister hotel in Cancun. We had an awful experience at the Gran Caribe in Cancun and demanded to be transferred to this resort. From the very beginning this resort was wonderful. This is totally a family resort. The staff was amazing. Jose Gomez at the front desk, Theresa the waitress at the pool bar, Patricia, the maid, all of the waiters in the Albatross (Marcello) and of course, i would be remiss if i didn't mention the Sports and Activities staff...Victor, Loredana, Cesar and Julio. All of these individuals work harder than i have ever seen anyone work and always have a smile on their face. The entire place is immaculate. There are always people cleaning and sweeping everywhere you look. The food was very good much to my surprise. I must admit i am a little picky and could find something to eat at each meal. My familiy enjoyed the food more than i did. The only negative thing i can say is that there is only 4 restaurants to eat in unless you want to go across the street to The Royal in which you will have to pay 50% of the bill which is okay but we chose not to because we had such a large group. We also enjoyed being so close to the downtown. It is a hidden surprise, especially at night when it is all lit up. There are many bargains to be had. The teenagers enjoyed this. The sports and activities staff has a daily events planned from morning to night. If it should rain, they bring activitities inside (cards, board games, etc) They are incredibly friendly and again work from morning til night...with a smile on their face The beach in front of the Porto real is just okay, but about a quarter of a mile down towards the Royal, it is beautiful and free of coral and seaweed.

The Gran Porto Real is directly on the ocean and offers access to plenty of activities for the family (our girls are 7 & 9).

Cons - not very many cons, but kids club could be a bit better (our girls didn't love it and one of the babysitters didn't comfort our youngest when she cried for me and later told me that it's \"bad\" that my daughter is so attached to me), the floors throughout the hotel are very slippery b/c of the constant humidity so one needs to be extra careful, we found a few ants in our room (only once) but we're from Florida so we understand life in the tropics comes with a few ants. Other than that, we had a broken door handle but maintenance fixed it within minutes, housekeeping was fast to respond to everything and we truly felt like royalty during our stay. The activities desk assistant gave great advice and helped us plan some AMAZING excursions to Chichen Itza and Xcaret. I don't recommend this hotel for very young children (not much for them), but elementary age kids and up will really enjoy the massive pool and ocean activities. We will likely go back.

We went through a travel agent who suggested the Gran Porto Real since we were traveling with our kids, 13 yrs. and 5 yrs. old. From the time we got out of our limo at the hotel, we felt like we were VIP's. The hotel was beautiful in and of itself, but the staff far exceeded any expectations we had. From our check-in to our check-out, we were greeted everyday by the friendly staff, and they helped me brush up on my Espanol. The kids had plenty to do, but of course the pool won out most days. Our 5 yr old was not afraid to stay at the Kid's Club by herself and didn't want to leave when we came to pick her up. Everything was in walking distance, the shopping, restuarants, etc. However, we did the all-inclusive, and I would say that is the way to go if you are doing a family vacation. After we checked in, we had Freddy, our Bell-boy show us to our room (which was beautiful, clean, something out of a movie) and handled everything, expertly. He even took us to see another room just in case we were not happy with the one we had. Then we got to meet another Freddie, he was Capitan of the Albatross Restuarant. He was so attentive and took time to notice the drinks we drank and the type of food we chose, so that when we went into the hotel restuarant, once we found a table, our drinks were there waiting for us. Before we left, he had a \"special\" seafood lunch prepared for us. Delicious! How awesome is that. There were so many others who just made our trip the best one we have ever taken. And the hotel definitely got raves when we went back home to Texas. I would definitely recommend the Gran Porto Real, Playa del Carmen Resort over and over again.

But let's start with the good: If you want to drink endless supplies of the cheapest, swilly booze imaginable\u2014with name brands you've never heard of\u2014this is your place! People who like it that I observed are there to drink, and gorge on the endless and endlessly mediocre food. Poolside, lobby, eateries\u2014it's all about the booze. Also good: The Beach is very nice, except that the portion for swimming in front of the hotel is too close to the smelly, dirty deep sea fishing boats parked right on the beach in front of the hotel. The nicer swim areas are a walk in either direction. Okay, now on to the bad, the ugly, and the worse. First, the noise. This place is not for relaxing. The lobby is loud, the bars are loud, the pool area is a joke -- always filled with blaring disco music, annoying \"recreation guys\" on the loudspeaker, and loud people ... driinking. At night, the shows and the music are all happening poolside and it is ridiculous. Like you went to a serene place and a disco broke out. The oceanfront rooms all face the music -- your room is neither tranquil or peaceful becase there are loudspeakers right outside up until 11pm EVERY NIGHT. We asked to move and we got a nice room down nearer the ocean ... only THEY SET UP WEDDING PARTIES WITH MORE LOUDSPEAKERS right under your room ALMOST EVERY NIGHT. We complained again and were told we had to pay more per night to \"upgrade\" from the oceanfront room to a \"master suite on the street side.\" Somehow, the street side was actually quieter. Not perfect. Quieter. And the room was nice. The help is neither especially helpful. Nice most of the time, but not really helpful. Except when they want to usher you off to a \"Welcome Host\" who can try to sell you some activity packages at ridiculous prices. NO matter that you arrive ridiculously tired and frayed from travel, they start selling RIGHT AWAY. The place pretty much sucks ... if you're not drunk and you don't care. The staff of workers is very nice ... although when we got to our first of four rooms, there were five of them hiding in our room watching soccer, instead of doing their jobs. Should I continue? Okay, I will! They tell you in advance they don't have parking for your rental car, but then, if you find a nice bell guy, he tells you he can park it for you in a covered lot across the street .. .no charge. Probably cuz they don't want you to rent a car, they want you to be stuck taking their ridiculously pricey bus tours. Onto the food: The main buffet is ... okay ... good even for many items. But, the room is not air conditioned and the grills are right out front and the place is like 120 degrees in there to sit and eat. The food is on ice but quickly wilts and melts and you have to wonder about the Tomain poisoning that could hit at any minute. The grilled food is the best ... fresh. The carved beef ... good. Not great, but good. breakfast are good ... waffles, pancakes freshly prepared. Lots of fruit that is decent. And lots of warmed over trays that are kinda gross. Again, have some cheap liquor and it goes down a little easier. At the beachside grill, nothing is grilled. All the burgers (filled with lots of filler) and hot dogs are brought out in hot trays from the kichens. There's nothing grilled about it. Hence, no grill smoke for miles. The nice Italian restaurant is good, a nice setting, the food about a 6.5. The Mexican place had good food ... it was pretty darn okay. All in all, Gran Porto Real is about the all-inclusivo booze and okay food ... and the booze .. .and the loud music. It kinda sucks. But hey, at least it's not as expensive as the nice places in Playacar and Myakoba. Don't go there for qualkty. Go for the bulk.

Note that we traveled with a 11-month old baby - we stayed here because the wedding we were invited to was at the adult-only hotel next door. Overall, we found the hotel to be very good, but not great. The hotel room was lovely, clean and spacious with a beautiful oceanfront view. We stayed on the side closest to the Royal hotel, making it an easy walk to the hotel next door (we had full access to restaurants next door) where the wedding festivities were located. The hotel food was fine, buffet was okay. Service was great. Beach was okay. We probably will not go back, but if you're looking for a good value all-inclusive, this seems like a safe choice. See below for more details. Hotel Room We were very happy with the Grand Master One Bedroom. Very spacious with three balconies overlooking the ocean. The air-conditioning worked great - there were two systems. Bathroom was shower only, but very large with plenty of room for our little one to play/bathe. Bed was very comfortable. Hotel supplied an average crib. Two LCD TVs, with plenty of channels to watch USA content like the NBA finals. The mini-fridge was not very cold, but plenty of drinks. Downside was the noise - lots of weddings. Service Check-in was slower than expected, and we didn't get a tour or explanation of the facilities so we had to figure things out on our own (no big deal). They supplied the crib pretty quickly after we settled in. Housekeeping was friendly, and they left a nice decorative towel arrangement with flowers every day. We tipped, so we didn't find the maid service to be slow or anything. The staff at the restaurants and at the pool was terrific, very friendly service with a smile. Food The buffet was okay, with breakfast being the best. Fruit selection was disappointing. The Italian restaurant was solid and the Mexican restaurant was decent - safe bets for dinner - you can take a nice stroll after dinner in the local area. The grill at the pool/beach had good snack/comfort food. Pool/Beach The main pool was crowded, but finding chairs was not too difficult. People did reserve chairs with their towels in the early morning, but there was always a place to sit. The pool water was warm, a little too warm in the late afternoon, but still refreshing. Lots of kids, including our own, so a little loud, but some drunk adults were more annoying. Pool was large, so never felt crowded. They had a basketball hoop and floaties for people to entertain themselves. The beach was okay - there is a drop off and a subtle bad smell on the beach. It's a bit rocky too - not as nice as Cancun. Our hotel room did have a private cabana, which was nice. Ocean was warm and calm. Misc. * Lots of weddings. Seemed like there were at least two per day. * We did the snorkeling adventure. Not bad, but be prepared for a two hour ride out round trip. * No air-con in the buffet or lounge area. * Forty minute ride to/from airport - about 600 pesos each way. * Mosquitoes linger - bring Off.", "Date": "June 30, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Playa del Carmen, Mexico", "Title": "\u201cgood quality\u201d", "Author": "donoban", "ReviewID": "UR69145090", "Content": "hello all, I take the time to send my congratulations on vacation because I had were unforgettable, thanks to the service of Gran Porto Real hotel, but above all the staff, I would mention everyone but I do not remember so I will mention The ones I agree, Samanta in reception, bar david, Teresa on the beach (I hope this at noon always, help with hot drinks because it uff) Regarding restaurants I remember Ivan and mahumael always give excellent service along with his captain edgar in the morning, always smiling, attentive, savior of Mary and Joseph's pescatore, rutile albatross, and I apologize to those who do not remember and write his name wrong, tell everyone thanks, thanks, thanks, I will return soon", "Date": "June 29, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Evans, Colorado", "Title": "\u201cWonderful stay\u201d", "Author": "bobo80620", "ReviewID": "UR69121168", "Content": "We had a wonderful stay at the Gran Porto Real Resort and Spa!

From the moment we arrived at the Registration Desk, to the time we checked out 7 days later, we all commented that this was the best vacation we had ever had. The bellmen were right there when we arrived with our pre-arranged ground transportation with Travel Impressions--many thanks to Benigno, Aaron and Josue for getting us comfortably into our rooms! The Front Desk staff was more genuinely friendly than any 5-star hotel I have ever stayed in. I hope I don't forget anyone at the Front Desk, but I do want to specifically thank Erika (and her sweet smile!), Claudia, and Yendaly not only for making us feel so welcome on arrival, but also for their helpfulness during our entire stay. Luis and Gabriel we also at the Front Desk when we checked out, and made the process completely painless for us. All three of us speak fluent Spanish, and I have to say, we felt like we were part of a family by the end of the second day of our stay. The Gran Porto Real also has world-class entertainment every night by the pool. I understand that the Entertainment Director has experience in television performance himself in Mexico City. Again, I'd like to thank the Entertainment Group, Julio C\u00e9sar and Lori (I hope I got her name right--\"Philomena\", from Boulder, CO) for putting on all the poolside activities and entertainment. The pool and lobby wait staff could not have been more attentive--they were right there with food and cold beverages, always delivered with a smile and a kind word--great work, Teresa, Jose, Pablo, Lorenzo, Jes\u00fas, Na\u00fam, El\u00edas, and Benito--much\u00edsimas gracias. Another amazing experience on our first day occurred as we were exploring the grounds of the hotel. A Security official, V\u00edctor, actually took us on a walking tour of the entire facility, One of the highlights of our trip was getting to watch and listen to an excellent jazz and salsa music group called \"Tequila.\" \u00c1lvaro, thanks for letting me sit in on saxophone! We also rented jet skis at the Royal Hotel next door, and played golf at Playacar, a 15-minute cab ride. All the restaurants associated with Gran Porto were gourmet quality--Mar\u00eda's, Il Pescatore, and Albatros. We also got off-site to eat at some local restaurants--El Fog\u00f3n, Tacos Ac\u00e1, (both informal) and La Parrilla, I highly recommend El Gran Porto Real to anyone looking for a low-stress vacation, at a great value. We have made frequent trips to Hawaii and will probably never go back there. Denver to Canc\u00fan is a 4-hour non-stop flight, and Playa del Carmen is only about 45 minutes from Canc\u00fan. The hotel itself is right on the sand, and a short walk away from Quinta Avenida, with plenty of restaurants, clubs and shopping. Almost all transactions can be done in US Dollars. This was our first attempt at an all-inclusive trip. This is definitely the way to go. All food and drinks are included in the cost of your room (the staff appreciates tips, and earns every bit of them!) There is so much to do, we couldn't get it all in in one week. We do plan on returning to El Gran Porto Real next year. We give them a giant \"A+\" for service, quality and value.

They will be as nice as can be until you either decline to join or ,if you do, have any problems with what they promised you and what you really sign up for. That is when you will discover that you made a BIG MISTAKE. Then it's too late! After going down and using my \"membership\" prices I did the simple math and found that no one ever pays their \"RACK\" price and so it is cheaper to just go on line or through a travel agent and book your stay because that price will include the airfare and is still cheaper than their \"CLUB\" price which is without air. Don't believe what they tell you about the perks with RCI it's just another selling tool they use among many others. They are very good in what they do. JUST DON\"T DO IT!

The rooms were comfy and very clean. The staff was very friendly and helpful. The a la carte restaurants were fantastic. And although they \"officially\" have a dress code, it was not strictly enforced. The pool is great, but of course, you have to have your towel out before 7 a.m. to get a lounger. We also enjoyed the \"tranquility\" pool and swim-up bar. There's always something to do... pool activities, bike tours, kayaks, etc. And we loved the close proximity to 5th Avenue. There were only a couple of minor negatives... the elevator had an overwhelming stench of mildew, as did the T-Zone. Our room was right above the speaker by the pool -- too loud! I highly recommend trying to get a room at either end of the building and not in the center over the pool. Our in-room safe regularly malfunctioned. They always sent someone up immediately to take care of it, but eventually we just stopped calling and put out the do not disturb sign when we weren't in the room. Overall, we had a fantastic time.

You really feel welcomed and the people you encounter are genuine. I will break up the reviews so that it's not one huge paragraph. Location- One of the most important things about this hotel is Location Location Location. GPR sits right in the Heart of Playa Del Carmen. Just steps away from the beach, 1 block away from 5ave Shopping and a quick stroll to the Pier to catch the boat to Cozumel. This will save you the trouble of taking a Cab or worrying about public transportation since you\u2019re already in the central shopping area, but be ready to pay for it\u2026tourist prices. Front desk / Check in- we checked in the afternoon and not to my surprise they could not find our reservation. I have read this happening to quite a few people. They asked to see a copy of my itinerary which I provided them, but you would think that the last name of a person would be enough. Like any hotel they offered me an upgrade to an Ocean front suite walk out, I politely declined and we stayed with our Ocean front suite. Staff was very nice. Bell staff - Very Professional, hospitable and attentive. I spent time getting to know one of the Bell man name Aaron. Every time I saw him he was always smiling and always ready to offer assistance. Aaron is a genuinely nice person and it shows. I enjoyed our conversations and I just wanted to say thank you for the great service and for being a great guy! Concierge- I rarely need to use the concierge while on vacation, but I\u2019m glad Astrid was there to help us out. My wife and I booked an excursion and to make a long story short the people at the resort next door (The Royal) made me very happy I did not book at that hotel. The Staff at the Royal need to learn from the Staff at the GPR about SERVICE. Service was inexcusable and I will be writing to the Diamond award association about my experience at The Royal. Remember if you\u2019re not staying at the Royal they will treat you like $%*! Astrid at GPR was very helpful and she went above and beyond to remedy the situation, she even chewed out the idiots who screwed up our excursion\u2026THANK YOU ASTRID !!!!! you saved our trip! Real Club Concierge- before we could even make it to our bags I was greeted by a gentleman from the Real Club. His name was Orlando and I have read many reviews about how guest felt annoyed and bothered by these individuals working for the Real Club. Orlando is a sweet heart! He was not pushy at all; he knew we just arrived and that we were tired from our trip. He sat us down in the lobby and gave us a quick run down of the property and what it had to offer. He was very informative and got to the point. I knew he was going to ask us about the going across the street to see the Royal so I beat him to it. He said that if we would like to go over there just let him know, but if we didn't then that was fine too. Through out our stay we would run in to Orlando and he was always a delight to talk to and he was always ready to take care of any of our needs. Thank you Orlando! Rooms-1st room- They gave us room 115. In general the rooms are wonderful. Tile Floors, high ceilings, Ceiling fan, Cold A/C, lots of flush lighting and eye pleasing furnishings and a good size King bed (HARD). Closet space is ample and the bath room is also a good size. The Patio is barely enough for one person let alone two. Two people max for a room of this size. Pros- The room is close to the lobby and the restaurants. 24 hour self serve bar literally next door. Wifi signal very strong so you can go wireless in your room. Roomy bed. Cons- The room is close to the lobby and the video game room & the 24 hour self serve bar ( you can hear every yell and scream). Since the floor is tile throughout the property you can hear everything. All the yelling, screaming and more yelling. The Ocean view from your balcony does not exists. It\u2019s a pool view. The Bed was hard, woke up with numb arms..LOL I complained and said that I did not pay for a pool view I paid $300 more for an ocean front view. I would not have cared, but that's still $300. They told me that all the rooms were full (BS) and that if I checked back the next day they would get me a different room. I had to wait for two days since we were out all day the following day. We had to repack everything and leave all our stuff with the front desk and when we returned we would have a new room. 2nd room- we get back from a long day at Xplor (a must do!) And they reassigned us to room 215...WOW really\u2026one floor up? That\u2019s the best you could do?. The room is a lot better than 115 and the view is an improvement, but not worth the $300 I paid, but what can you do? I didn\u2019t want to waste the rest of my vacation fighting with the Front desk so I just stuck I out enjoyed the rest of my vacation. Pros- View was better than 115 and you still had a strong WiFi connection. Close to stairs and elevator. Good viewing location for the nightly shows. Roomy bed. Cons- No hammock, small patio, view could be better. Hard bed. Our Housekeeper Mari Cruz always made great towel figurines which always brought a smile as we got back to our rooms. Thank you. Restaurants/bars- I will only mention the 5 restaurants we went to, but there are 8. Albatros (buffet)- I\u2019ve been to other AI\u2019s before (RIU) and I think GPR really missed the mark on this one. The food was hit and miss and there was a lack of flavor. Breakfast was usually the worst. Nothing to rave about. Lunch and dinner were OK, but I have seen better. They need to add more choices and a lot more authentic Mexican food. Even the generic American food wasn\u2019t that good. Service during Lunch and dinner were was nice, but the breakfast service was down right unpleasant. I know it\u2019s busy, but I did not see one smile out of any of the servers during the 7 day stay there, and even with bad service I still tipped. IL Pescatore- This Italian restaurant was great! Everything was delicious and the service was excellent. I suggest the Shrimp risotto, prosciutto and melon and the beef Capriccio. Everything we tried was very good and this was became our dinner restaurant for 3 of the 6 nights. Our servers Pepe and Israel were very attentive and took care of our needs before we could ask. The head Chef even stopped by our table, Nice. Maria\u2019s- I have heard complaints about this Mexican restaurant, but my wife and I didn\u2019t see any problems with the food or the service. Large groups did have trouble getting seated and I can see where that might be a complaint. My wife and I got seated quickly and the atmosphere was festive and romantic. Our server Fernando took real good care of us; my drink never hit the bottom. The food was good & spicy. The portions were larger than the Italian restaurant and the flavor was excellent. Parrillada Grill- Located out side on the beach this is great if you don\u2019t feel like going back into the hotel. The food choices are American (hamburger, hot dogs, and nachos) and they even had fresh cevich. 24/7 self serve- question, what do you do with food that was not eaten at the buffet? You put it in the 24/7 self serve. The food tasted like it was left out for a while, but at 2 in the morning you get what you can take. There is also all you can pour alcohol and beer on tap and in case you needed your daily internet fix there are 3 computer to use, for a fee of course. Lobby Bar- service was good and fast. TV\u2019s in the lobby were a life saver since they had the NBA simi finals on. Bar service on the Beach- Service was excellent! All I remember saying was \u201cuno mas Theresa\u201d. Service with a smile and I owe it all to Theresa. She remembered what my Wife and I were drinking and where we were on the beach every day. I can\u2019t say enough about how Nice Theresa was and how she made our days on the beach a memorable one. Special thanks to Carlos who also hooked it up! Nightly entertainment- Besides watching some of those who had one too many, the scheduled nightly entertainment was good. It\u2019s a full production and they put a lot of time and effort into each show. On Nights My wife and I got back to the hotel early we sat out on the balcony and watched the show. They really try to get the crowd involved and its worth catching at least 1 show. Seating is awkward since the pool takes most of the area and the seats are to the right of the stage or up near the bar area. One night it rained and they moved the show to the lobby\u2026that was a tight squeeze, but they still pulled it off. Beach- I\u2019ve read the reviews about how the beach was torn up, don\u2019t worry it\u2019s not. The beach is great, lots of room for football, volleyball, catch or just lounging around. The water was really nice and salty. Be careful because there is a 4 foot drop from the beach to the water before you even hit the water. This is thanks to beach erosion. There are plenty of beach chairs and covered cabanas, we were on the beach 5 out of the 7 days and had no problems with finding either. The beach has a few drawbacks: Boats anchored to the beach, left side of beach closest to the pier is rocky and the water can get crowed fast since there is only a narrow portion of good beach/water. I never really ran into a problem and no one really cared, every one had a great time. Pool- pretty average, but a bit small for a resort. I would rather jump in the ocean. Lounge chairs around the pool don\u2019t fill up until 10ish, so you can sleep in. Special Dinner on the beach- My Wife and I were celebrating our 3rd wedding anniversary and I surprised her with dinner on the beach. It was priceless! The candle light dinner was Magical and we will never forget it. There was so much attention so detail and the Service was outstanding, thank you Carlos(waiter)! and Omar/Estaban (event coord\u2026.sorry I forgot your name!). I can not say enough oh how impressed i was with the staff and how they pulled this off. You have to ask the front desk about this, it\u2019s not advertised. Spa- did get to use it, went across the street to Veronica's Massage. Security- I felt very save during my stay at GPR. There are the unsung hero which are the Security guards. I would wake up in the middle of the night and grab a drink from the minibar and just sit on the patio. Like clock work I would see security walk past and check the property. There is always some one patrolling and I just wanted to acknowledge there hard work. Overall the Property is what sells people to come to this resort, but it\u2019s the people who make you come back. I totally recommend the Gran Porto Real to anyone and everyone.

All of our wishes came true. It is about a 35 minute drive from the airport to the hotel. When we checked in (early evening), we were handed drinks and the kids had OJ. Check in was not a problem as we had done it online. We checked out our family suite, it was not the king size bed we wanted, but knew that it was a request - not a given. THe kids loved the bunk beds and the view of the pool and ocean. They really loved the hammock on the balcony. Then we checked out the kid's club to see if the kids would want to do some of the activities. Let's just say that the club didn't open until 9am and they were waiting every morning for 9am to role around. Some of the activities that they did: face painting, making cookies, watching movies, basketball, soccer, pirate day complete with pirate show that the kids were in, pool time, etc. Some of the activities the grown ups did - sleep, drink, sleep, and enjoyed adult conversation. The staff was spectacular, the hotel was clean, and the food was very good. The drinks were definately the best and they kept them coming! We never left the hotel for the 5 days we were there. It was a great vacation and a wonderful first travel experience for the boys. I cannot say enough about the kids club and the rest of the staff.

We chose this hotel because of its location, which was perfect. Other than that, it didn't do much to impress me. Check in was easy, they gave us their house drink, Wilma Hurricane which was delicious. After about 30 minutes in our room, it was pretty clear the A/C was not working very well. I called the front desk and asked if we could be moved. She offered me a bottle of wine. Wine? That will cool our room down? I explained that really wouldn't work, so she begrudgingly agreed to send someone to my room who could show us another room on the same floor. Great, a plan in place. A very nice gentleman showed up, took us to another room, A/C worked great. At this point I realized that while we had reserved and paid for a Jr. Suite, the first room was not what we had paid for, since the second room was actually a junior suite and much larger. The rooms are actually quite nice, very Mexican in design, and while definitely dated, they are nice rooms. The cleaning of the rooms was not done very well, but it was adequate. The beach is okay. There is a large drop off, many, many fishing boats. It didn't seem like a relaxing place to go, so we skipped the beach. The pool, this is where I had some issues. The main pool doesn't allow drinks while in the pool. I realize there will probably be a lot of varying opinions on this, but it is vacation. I enjoy a drink while I'm floating around and relaxing. Now here is where I know many people will disagree with me. You can't even sit on the edge of the pool with your feet in the water and smoke a cigarette. Are they afraid the pool will catch on fire? I know smoking is offensive to many, I didn't plan on jumping in with a group of people and lighting up, but if I'm sitting off by myself, I might want to smoke. I could have moved back 2 feet and had my cigarette, so it's not like it was a non-smoking area. I do try to be respectful of not smoking around kids or any others, but it was the outdoors. Please don't spend a lot of time bashing me about this, I smoke, I know it's offensive to others and I try to be respectful. We went up to the adult pool to try that area. This is a pool that is not much larger than a backyard pool, even smaller than some. It looked like they were having a frat party there, so we left. Another note on both pools, if you have mobility issues, there is no easy way to exit the pools. You either climb a ladder or pull yourself up on a big ledge and then stand up and walk out. We didn't try the a la cartes, so I can't comment. The buffet was good for breakfast, just okay for the other meals. We had some intestinal issues (my first time in over a dozen visits to Mexico), but it's hard to tell if it was from our next hotel, because they started our first day there, or from GPR. The staff at this hotel work very hard, they were all very pleasant (except for the front desk who offered me wine instead of A/C). The location was exactly what we wanted, close to PDC to get our shopping done before moving to another location for a week. We really didn't have any issues with noise from the street, I'm not sure whether we were facing towards the street, the only thing I could see from our balcony was a white building and an exhaust fan below on the roof. If you're looking for a basic hotel that puts you in a great location in the center of Playa del Carmen, this hotel is a good choice. Otherwise, I wouldn't suggest GPR.", "Date": "June 6, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Yorkshire, England", "Title": "\u201cOkay - But felt like being in one big wedding party - even though i was not a guest!!\u201d", "Author": "Xavier_uk", "ReviewID": "UR66472172", "Content": "The hotel is relativley small and compact compared to many of the hotels in Mexico. There are 3 gripes I am going to get out of the way straight away:- 1 Room cleaning - It is very thorough,but takes for ages (1 hour plus and I had a 2 hours one once!). But you have no clue when it will happen. If you put on your please clean sign on the room at 9am it may take them to 3pm (even 5pm starts are not uncommon) for it to be cleaned even though rooms without the signs are done first!! 2 Service in the buffet. The buffet is a self service except for drinks, these you have to order. There were a couple of lunch times when I was ignored for the entire meal by the waiting staff as they were getting ready for the next meal service. Not impressed at all. 3 Boxed Lunch - Don't bother it is foul and good enough for the bin. Went out one day and ordered them the night before, the take out lunch. That morning went to reception in order to pick them up, they was not ready. After 15 minutes they arrived and I would have been better to have gone to 24 hours snack bar and picked up bits there. In our 3 boxes there was 1 rancid sandwich between the boxes. This has many positives and also a lot of negatives about the resort. The positives is that everything is within easy walking distance and that it is not too far from one side of the hotel to the beach. The hotel is within easy walking distance from the centre of Playa Del Carmen if you want to walk out and explore. A lot of fresh fruit in the breakfast. The main negative it that it is too small for the number of wedding parties which happen. I was there for a week and there was a wedding there at least an average of 1 wedding a day. This would not be that bad but this one wedding party a day. Some of the wedding parties were 40 plus people. There are 2 main bars in the hotel and it happened on several of the nights that the wedding parties would take over 1 of the bars. I do not like going to a hotel and feeling second rate. While I was there is was windy for most of the days. This was okay as the hotel blocked the wind from the main pool and beach side of the hotel. The downside of this was that you would be \"moved\" in order that the outside wedding could be accomodated. There is nothing realy wrong with the hotel but it did not feel as relaxed as I had hoped.

The buffet , open for breakfast, lunch and dinner was only good during breakfast and lunch.

Beds were pretty uncomfortable but we were so tired every night it did not make much of a difference. We stayed in a Junior Suite and were very happy about that. Since we did not stay in the room very much it was not necessary for us to spend the extra money on the view. I had two massages while I was there... Walk down the beach towards the pier and a block up you will find the \"Massage Center.\" Two massages for $40 an hour. Can't beat that! It is a white outdoor building, bar below, massages upstairs over looking the ocean. All in all the vacation was very nice. The resort is a bit outdated so if you can afford to spend a little more and you do not have children, stay at the Royal. the Royal is much larger and luxurious, well worth the money! On the other hands this resort is perfect for families. Vendors come every night to the resort..

We were greeted with smiles and handshakes and left with laughter and hugs. Each staff member made an effort to ensure that every aspect of our vacation was perfect. The servers in the restaurants, on the beach, and at the bars were outstanding. I felt as though we were always taken care of. The service was prompt and always with a smile. My sisters and I truly enjoyed the entertainment staff at this resort. Each member (especially Cesar, Chicken, and Carlos) was welcoming, happy, funny, enthusiastic, and personal. During the day they kept us engaged with beach volley ball, dance lessons, and other fun activities. Throughout the evening they accompanied us to the night clubs to ensure we had perfect spots, non stop drinks, crazy fun, and amazing memories. One staff member in particular (Cesar) made our \u201csisters\u201d trip memorable. Cesar always took a little extra time to ensure we were getting the most out of our vacation. He played a huge role in the amount of fun we had on that trip. Cesar made sure that us girls were always safe, always together, and always having a blast. We are definitely returning to the Grand Porto Real next year. We will anxiously wait to re-unite with all the individuals we made friends with.", "Date": "May 26, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Houston", "Title": "\u201cA good vacation but hotel could be better\u201d", "Author": "moviHouston", "ReviewID": "UR65203778", "Content": "Just came back from Playa del Carmen a week ago. This is our 2nd time visting the city but first time staying at Gran Porto Real Resort. Beach is beautiful. Weather was hot with scattered rain. Pros: Gran Porto Real Resort did a good job in keeping the beach clean daily. The staff is accomadating. Hotel is outdated but they do make attempt to keep place clean. Great location: just minutes from 5th Ave. Cons: For an all-inclusive hotel, the food was not the best even with the buffet changes menu daily. Like other reviews, I admit breakfast was good (plenty of fresh juices and fruits). Take note: Hotel Mexican and Italian restaurants open in evening only. The food is decent but small portion. Recommendation: 1 hr body massage along 5ht Ave is much cheaper than hotel. A couple massage cost $55 USD. The facility is clean and safe with certified therapist.

We have 3 kids and stayed in a Family Suite, which was perfect. The hotel itself is kept immaculate, staff constantly cleaning. Our room was very spacious, but the Family Suites do vary in size. The first one we got had 2 double beds (despite having requested a King bed 3 times - when making the reservation, by phone after making it, and again doing the online check in). However, we went back to the desk and were immediately given a room with a King bed. It was on the corner, and had about twice as much space as the first one and two balconies. (One facing the pool and ocean, one facing some ugly lot and distant ocean view, but still nice). There weren't bathtubs, but huge lovely showers. I thought the restaurants were all pretty good. The buffet had a decent selection, the snack bar at the pool had nachos, hamburgers, hot dogs etc (The guac was excellent!). The Mexican and Italian restaurants both had a good selection. They are outside the hotel, but attached to it, which is kind of nice because you actually feel that you are going out. One of our daughters has food allergies, and we brought a list (in English and Spanish) of what she could and could not eat, and they were extremely accommodating, even the buffet would make her a special meal. We were there for our wedding, so about 30 people were there with us. We were able to use a large private room in the Italian Restaurant the 1st night for a private meal -- just had to buy a couple bottles of wine. The wedding planners who I dealt with before the trip (who are located in the US) were by far the least helpful, unaccommodating and generally stupid people I have ever encountered. The day we left for our trip, I received an email indicating that we were booked for June (a month off), 4:00 pm (our wedding was at 11) and on North Beach (we were scheduled on Central). That is really the least of it. . . it would take them 2 emails and a phone call to get an answer to the most simple, basic question like \"what are the meal options,\" \"how much is cake\" etc. This turned out to be a blessing in disguise because I got fed up with them and instead booked a Catamaran for our wedding reception which turned out to be the best wedding reception ever. The onsite wedding person was wonderful, she expressed frustration with the phone/web planners because they hadn't told her if I wanted a bouquet or any details about the ceremony either, however, she pulled our very basic wedding ceremony off without a hitch and was lovely to work with. The location of this hotel is great - you just walk up the street to 5th Ave where all the shopping/restaurants are. You can also walk the beach to the ferry. Several reviews indicated that Ocean Front rooms are noisy at night because of the noise from the Blue Parrot, but our room was on the corner closest to the Blue Parrot and we never heard any noise at all (the hotel nightly shows are pretty loud, but they are over by 10). Huge props to FAT CAT Catamaran out of Puerto Adventuras -- our 4 hour rental was a huge highlight of our trip. So many of our guests told us it was the best wedding reception they'd ever been to, and the customer service was so above and beyond it was amazing. We went on a 4 hour trip, stopped at a reef to snorkle (I got to hold a live starfish & sea urchin) then we stopped and lazed around in the ocean and got to ride the boom net). The boat is beautiful, the staff friendly and fun (and they looked out for the little kids like hawks). One other thing about the hotel is that the kids club is wonderful. You have to stay on site while the kids are checked in, but they have all kinds of fun activities, and our little kids begged to go. . . which gave all of us a really nice chance to relax. Finally . . . there are tons of places along the beach offering massages for $18 - $20 for an hour. The very best is almost all the way to the ferry (you pass 3 lifeguard stands) and then there are just 4 tables under a palapa. We've been there twice and they are amazing. It was $30 for 90 minutes, and both my husband and I were in heaven.", "Date": "May 22, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Crossville, Tennessee", "Title": "\u201cExperience from beginning to end was a true pleasure!\u201d", "Author": "ValentineMs", "ReviewID": "UR64949772", "Content": "Our stay at Gran Porto Real in Playa del Carmen was, as always, perfect. Perhaps the most ideal thing about this resort is its staff, all of whom make guests feel valued and appreciated. You will be treated with wonderful warmth and hospitality from staff members who work tirelessly to make sure your every need is catered to. In addition to their personal touch, you will notice that they work continuously to keep the resort spotless and well maintained. This resort has the feel of real luxury yet it is casual enough to be unpretentious. You will see people in shorts and sandals and those who prefer to dress with more elegance. There is also an interesting mixture of young and old, families and singles. We saw several lovely indoor and outdoor weddings while we were at Gran Porto and noticed that many large families came to reunite from around the country and, no doubt, from around the world. While in the 24 hour snack bar, I took some time to watch the young women working in the daycare and was impressed with the constant care and attention given to the children of the guests. It seems that no matter what your age, you are treated like royalty when you are at Gran Porto Real! One of the things we like best about the resort is the location. It is within easy walking distance of downtown Playa del Carmen. However, once inside the resort or beachside on the grounds, you feel that you are away from anything resembling a city and truly in a beachside paradise. The rooms, the common areas and the pool area are close enough to the beach so that almost anywhere in the resort you can either see the beach or, at the very least, hear the ocean and feel of ocean breezes. What a choice in food! You can choose from the Albatross Restaurant (elegant and extensive buffet), Maria\u2019s Restaurant (Mexican), Pescatore Restaurant (Italian) and numerous snack bars. The resort food is amazing, in all restaurants the presentation is something out of a magazine and your wait staff will be the icing on the cake. We chose to go to the buffet for most meals and were blessed to usually have a marvelous waiter by the name of Dion. His service was impeccable. Dion was a charming young man with a warm smile and cheerful attitude. He never seemed to tire of giving us Spanish lessons when we asked or answering our many questions about the Mexican Riviera or Mexico in general. The other wait staff was marvelous as well but we tried our best to have Dion as our server whenever possible. The junior suites are very spacious and, if an unobstructed view of the ocean is important to you, make certain you get an ocean front suite. An ocean view room may have some view of the ocean but it can be either from a distance or with some building obstruction or both. I spoke with several people who had the least expensive rooms (not suites and without any beach view). They all stated that because they spent very little time in their rooms, they were quite happy with their rooms and felt that, due to the lower room fares, they were getting an excellent value for their accommodations. Our housekeeper, Patricia, was phenomenal. In addition to keeping the room in perfect condition, she also left us lovely swans sculpted out of towels and made certain our refrigerator was full of the drinks we preferred. As with other staff members, she made us feel welcome and completely at home. At the resort you will probably have the pleasure of meeting Monserat, the patient woman who works at the money exchange. Despite my repeated math errors and inability to accurately ask for change, Monserat never lost her smile or her sense of humor. I have no qualms about recommending the Gran Porto Real. The experience from beginning to end was a true pleasure. The one thing nicer than the accommodations and the location is the staff; you will never meet a finer group of people anywhere.

We ate in the main dining room for breakfast every morning which was delicious- lunch and dinner were good- you must order Mayan Coffee- its quite a show and yummy! We did venture out to eat alot at night just because we like to change it up- just up the street Luna Rossa has the best pizza Ive had in a long time!! The entertainment at night was fun- dancing, costumes, music, crowd involvement- these guys and gals seem to work every day- Chicken and Patricia are full of energy!! Our room was lovely- just a few things needed to be updated, like towel racks, tv, but really over all we were just over the moon about the whole experience! I cant forget to mention Orlando, who worked really hard to get us into the time share presentation the first day- I was resistant, because I know the time it takes, but he made it worth our while!

The staff are super friendly and so good at getting everyone involved and having fun which made it really easy to meet other people who were staying at the resort. The evening entertainment was always awesome too. They had indoor and outdoor events with dancers and performers - we even got to dance on stage with them!! When you stay at the Porto Real, ask for Cesar - he is a member of the Entertainment staff. Cesar made our trip so much fun I cannot imagine what we would have done without him!

We were shown to our room which was very basic indeed, but as we'd not upgraded in the UK, this was what we were expecting. As it was our honeymoon, we decided to upgrade to a Junior Suite which had an ocean view and was about 4 rooms back from the front of the hotel and directly opposite the sister \"Royal\" just across the avenue. We were also shown a direct ocean view suite which was more expensive, but the one we chose was by far the best. The food was gorgeous, the service in general and the pools and beach were so good. We felt we were in paradise and having such a wonderful honeymoon. It was everything we wanted and more. On the 5th day we noticed there was lots of drilling and banging going on so after a few hours I spoke to the manager to raise our concerns and was assured it would be finished that day. It continued the next day and we agreed that as we were going to be out all of the following day it wasn't causing us any undue distress but one more day of it when we returned and we would not be happy - after all.....we were honeymooners! On the 7th day we awoke to more drilling and banging and I went to see the manager who totally understood our concerns and summonsed a bell boy to take us over to \"The Royal\" to choose a room for ourselves.....he was upgrading us for the 2nd week of our stay absolutely free! We were convinced that they would show us to the worst room in the hotel, but thats not possible because all the rooms are just amazing....in room jacuzzi's etc etc! It was beyond anything we ever thought possible and we were so grateful to the manager for this. I would definitely stay at the Gran Porto Real again because even without the upgrade to The Royal, it was still an amazing location and the service was out of this world.

Our junior suite was to have 2 queen beds many in our group got a room with a roll away cot as the second bed. They said \"they supply the room not the beds.\" This is a Buyer Beware. We could not unpack as the next day they did move us. With that room the electrical sockets did not work. They said keep your key card in the electricity acitvation slot. Told them I had did this and check the power surge buttons on the sockets. The electircity did not work. I think we were treated as dumb women who had never even cut on an electrical switch more less fixed one. WRONG. After the third time to the front desk on this issue, which at that point I explained most of my first 30 hours in Mexico had been at their front desk. They came to the room with a maintence man and guess what he found a fuse issue. The food was average at best. Our group paid extra one night (ll Pescatore) so that we could eat together. Other than that we never overwhelmed the staff; however one night we had 12 of us (Albatros) and we begged just for a glass of water. Many of us had finished eating before we got water. The 4 at our table when 2 did get water ended up sharing their water. We were never asked about soft drinks, tea, etc. Forget. The staff was arguing on who's tables they were.

If you are use to average dinining this might be okay. The best meals we found was breakfast....how do you mess up waffles, yougart, fruit, pastries? Our safe we had to fix the batteries and then we ended up having to get the front desk twice to come fix it on our last day.

We booked an Ocean View JR. Suite AI package through Air Canada Vacations. The Resort's online booking was painless and it worked. We had been to Mexico 2 previous times and wanted to try a place right in Playa Del Carmen, this seemed like the place. We travel at least twice a year. CHECK IN: As I said earlier, we used the Resort's online booking, 48 hours before arrival. When we arrived, it was 10:30 AM; I asked where we should go if we had checked in on line, we were escorted away from the line up of 20 or so people to the concierge desk. Our room was assigned, but not ready until 3:00 PM. We knew this would be the case long before we arrived. We received our bracelets, checked our luggage with the bellhops, had some champagne, explored the resort and had lunch. THE RESORT IN GENERAL: The resort is well maintained, and \"see yourself in the floor tiles\" clean, I mean it\u2019s CLEAN. It's not a large place, if you plan on having just a \"Resort Experience\", this is not the place for you. We used it as a base to play in Playa Del Carmen. There are \"ZERO\" grounds and the property is small, you have a pool and beach...that's it. The pool was ok, and the beach was ok as well, now that the beach reclamation is complete. Activities are the usual, some water sports, pool games, beach games, a Kids Zone and a cool room with XBox 360's with LCDs for the \"tweens\", our children are in their 20's and did not travel with us, SO, we couldn't care less about activities for kids. THIS IS A FAMILY resort, so if you don't go for that, DON'T book the place. The shows at night are like any other resort, the animation crew works hard and you will laugh at the \u201con stage\u201d contests. OUR SUITE: Well the online booking payed off. We received a beautiful Spanish colonial suite, with King Size bed and an Ocean view that didn\u2019t require leaning precariously over your Balcony rail, we also requested an \"upper level\" suite, we were placed on the top floor. House keeping was the best we have experienced to date. We have traveled 6 times since April 2007. The fridge was always stocked with Beer, soda and water. I don't know how many times a week this is supposed to happen, but a dollar in the fridge insured that there was always beer in the fridge, TWICE on one particular day. The Wall mounted Liquor Cabinet was stocked with Vodka, Rum, Scotch and Whiskey...we didn't even use it. EVERYTHING in our room functioned, hot water, TV, toilet, Air conditioning and door locks. Those of you that had trouble getting your rooms in order...did you arrive late at night; was your travel party a ridiculous size of 8 or more? Let me tell you, you are not the only people that were booked at this resort...it's usually early bird gets the worm. Try showing up before early evening for your rooms, talk to your travel agents and get better arrival times. I've been witness to a travel agent telling a traveler one thing and actually selling them another, meaning you paid the agent for a suite and they booked you into a room; check this out when you get home, you may have been a victim of this, we do not use agents. When asked if we wanted to upgrade to the Royal across the street, we simply replied if we wanted that, we would have booked that...end of the topic for the entire week. THE SPA AND FITNESS CENTER: Sorry, didn't use it. It looked very nice. THE WEATHER: One overcast day, still hot but a good day for a walk up the public beach. It rained that evening, so we watched the show which was moved indoors, a bit crammed. The rest of the week was 35 to 37 Deg. and sunny. THE BUFFET: This has got to be the worst Buffet I have ever been to, my wife on the other hand enjoyed it. A reviewer had mentioned it was just like a RIU buffet, sorry dude it wasn't even close. I've been to 2 RIU resorts in 3 years, THEY have good buffets. The only thing good about this buffet was Breakfast and the sweets they offered. There might have been one good lunch, and one good dinner there all week. THE ALL INCLUSIVE 24 HOUR ROOM SNACK BUFFET This was stocked from the main buffet...end of review. THE ITALIAN A LA CARTE: Unlimited visits walk up...no reservations...THANK GOD. The atmosphere here is great, the food and service enjoyable, no bad experiences. With just 2 of us, we never waied more than 2 mins for a table. We ate here a lot. THE MEXICAN A LA CARTE: Just like the Italian, less formal. Ate here a lot as well THE POOL-BEACH SNACK BAR. Hotdogs, fries, burgers, Nachos and Chilli......blahhhh. I grabbed the fruit, which is good everywhere. The french fries (Chips for you Brits) were terrible everywhere on the resort. ROOM SERVICE: It was included, other guests said it was ok, but we didn't use it. We were just too busy to \"CAMP\" out in our room. The menu appeared to have good choices. THE RESORT STAFF: Excellent, every single one of them. WEDDINGS: This place is small, with sometimes 2 weddings a day, this equates to too many weddings. This created \"Bridezillas\" out of otherwise sweet young women. I understand, this is the Bride and Groom's day, but the rest of us view yourself and your entourage as just another bunch of guests, we see you as NOTHING MORE and NOTHING SPECIAL. Lol, I've never seen so many grooms so wasted and drunk that the Honeymoons must have been a sleep session. Still laughing over that one. GROOMS, your new wives were beautiful...what's up with the \"so bombed\" that you can't function routine anyways? lol. BARS, BOOZE and BOOZE SERVICE: The bar in the 24 HR AI room was self serve. Beer on Tap was called \"Montezuma\" it was ok when cold, in fact all of the on tap beer at the resort is Montezuma. The liquor bar in the AI room is well stocked. The main lobby bar was great and fast. The pool bar also was fast. Our favourite was the \"sit down\" service, anywhere you sat, including the beach; your drink order was taken and delivered quite speedily. If on the beach, you could get around 4 drinks per hour brought to you..not bad..not bad at all. The booze is like any other resort, if you want premium Alcohol, tip and ask for it, it's that easy. The A la Cartes had the best beer, all of the local brands as opposed to \"Montezuma\" at the rest of the resort. Superior was the beer in our fridge, it was ok as well. Benito on the beach will not allow you to go \"dry\". THE REAL CLUB. Very good salesmen/women when it comes to selling you a RIP-OFF package. Their base is the \"Hospitality\" desk, don't get fooled. When you get into your room, you will get a call to come pick up your \"Discount\" card for use at the resort, DON'T TAKE IT..in fact don't take anything from them for free...it's far from free. Use the \"Welcome\" phone call to inform them you are not Interested and you prefer not to be contacted or approached again for the duration of your stay...it works, they just smiled and waved for the rest of the week, BUT they did not approach us for a sales pitch. If you fall prey to the discount card, hand it back directly to the Real Club member that gave it to you, if you don't or you lose it....a charge shows up on your credit card. I am giving the resort a 4, based on the buffet and the WAY too many weddings, some of them really did not look happy. We have been to better places. I would recommend this place to friends and family, but not to ALL of my friends and Family. We would personally return here, but we have this thing about trying a new place each time, so it may be years before we return. In closing all I can say is traveling to places like Mexico successfully is all in your mind set, THAT will make the difference in a good or bad trip for you, don't sweat the small stuff.

We booked a year in advanced jr suit ocean view, 2 queen beds. Upon arrival our room had been given away, so we were placed in another ocean view which was fine till we walked into it and there was 2 king size beds and one of them was a fold up cot. There was no place to move in the room and the fold up cot was as hard as a brick. The garbage\u2019s had dirty tampons in them, it was gross. Then in the afternoon when I went to get a shower there was no hot water, so taking all day for them to come fix around 12 am I was finally able to shower. After my shower I crawled into my tacky cot and the covers were damp, both beds had damp covers. Finally the next day we went down and requested another room, again none were available other than an upgrade to ocean front which cost us another $200. Also at the end of the week after the cleaning lady left we found a man\u2019s dirty shirt on the table in our room, and my mother\u2019s ring was missing. They would not explain to us why it was in there, they didn\u2019t care. **The beaches were gross, full of seaweed and boats. You have to walk a ways to get to a nice beach.** ********THE POOL CLOSES AT 9pm****** ****THE SWIM UP BAR CLOSES AT 6pm AND SO DOES THE HOT TUB****** (I thought that was kind of silly) As for the food the buffet was terrible, breakfast was the only good meal, the two restaurants were good though just not the buffet.

We have stayed at different resorts every year, and love to try a new Resort each year. On arrival, we were greeted with smiles, drinks, and the suggestion of an opportunity to upgrade. Elena and Luis were very patient with us in explaining the added amenities, and with one of our party not there yet, they encouraged us to check out the rooms before making the decision. I don't want this to come across as a negative in anyway, as I always assume that you get what you pay for. We did negotiate from the first offered price, and after viewing the rooms, there was no comparison, so we agreed to the upgrade. The downside was we could only have the room for 6 out of our 7 nights, and although we tried to keep the room the last night, we had to move to our lesser room, and were glad we had been fortunate enough to have the 1st room for as long as we did. Our upgraded Suite was FABULOUS!! Close to the pool, ground level, fabulous King size bed, with big fluffy duvet, a great bar, brand new furniture and chocolates every night by our bed. Our maid was exceptional, and our room was spotless and well maintained the entire time we had that room. She left Hibiscus flowers decorating the beds and bathroom each day. We had our own sun bed outside on the beach, and were able to use the restaurants 3 nights at the Royal across the street. The Asian restaurant there was amazing! The Pelacanos on the beach was fabulous as well, and Victor was very efficient to greet us with bug spray on the very still night that we had dinner there. We didn't really have a bad problems with Mosquito's, but found that if there was no breeze, there were bugs. Mateo and Alex were wonderful at the Italian restaurant and I will be forever grateful for Mateo making us Mayan coffees, his fabulous service and hugs when we left. Alonso, Jose, Benito, and all the other Beach staff that I can't remember their names, were wonderful. Friendly, smiling and offering their services constantly. The drinks were top notch. The Entertainment staff, Alejandro, Jesus, Caesar, Alex, (sorry if I missed anyone), were wonderful!! The Buffet staff were all so friendly, and for our group of 3, always accommodating. Teresa at the 24 hr. cafe/bar was so wonderful!! Always smiling, and always offering her help, We felt very pampered the entire time we were there. The one thing I have found in the Mayan area, is if you want to have a good time, you will. If you smile and are happy, everyone loves you. If you treat others as equals, you WILL have an excellent experience. Stuff happens sometimes, but everyone is human, and if we move on and laugh about it, it's all good. Now for some things that the Porto Real needs some help on. The Gym....what can I say. First of all, I work out 5 times a week. I went once there. It is extremely cramped, and the floor is warped badly, never mind the amount of sand on the floor. The treadmills are ok, but if you aren't prepared to just use some free weights to get through your workout, don't waste the effort to go there. The Older rooms....our last night we were put on the 3rd floor above the pool. The view was it's saving grace. The beds were ancient, and saggy, with very ugly covers that you pulled away from you. They have tried to extend the life of the beds by adding the contoured foams to them. Our shower didn't drain properly, and I cleaned the floor behind the door around the toilet, because it had been missed for sometime. The floor had spots of tar on it,, and the mirror frame was chipped and really needed to be tossed. I assume they are going to renovate like the room we stayed in initially, because quite frankly, I could not have managed to stay in that room for a week. We had seen the other room next to this one when we first arrived, and I assumed they showed us a bad one to encourage us to upgrade....no such luck. Our glass sliding door leaked so badly, that although we had the A/C on the entire day and night (we had a spare key that we left in so the power stayed on) we cooked all night. If you walked near the glass door, you could feel the heat. The towel shelf is clear on the opposite side as the shower in the bathroom, so don't forget to get one before you get in. Room # 359. The Nightlife at the resort was very difficult. We would have loved to experience the shows every night, but they were on at 8:30 p.m. and we found it interfered with our meal times. It was over by 9:30 and then there was pretty much nothing except a small band on 2 of the evenings. The Friday night the band was outside by the pool until 11:00 p.m. and it was a fun evening of dancing and making new friends. I must admit the Resort does offer fully escorted service to Senior Frogs, and Coco Bongo which we did not take advantage of. Most of the other resorts we have stayed at have had their own Disco and nightlife, so you are free to arrive and leave at your leisure. We were 3 girls and didn't feel we could do that with the service offered. So there you have it. Would I stay there again?? Absolutely. I would still choose the upgrade though, so for the money, it 's a bit pricey for a very small resort. But for the Service, it would be worth every penny :)", "Date": "May 2, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Moncton", "Title": "\u201csorry to say but\u201d", "Author": "8fortheroad", "ReviewID": "UR62531678", "Content": "I was very disappointed .

So this tells me they were not giving us what we payed for from the beginning. We were not ready to accept this and they said they could not do any thing now to come back in the morning. So we let our rep take care of it. If 4 js rooms were not available , then how did we get standard rooms assigned together. They play games in my opinion . They really want you to pay to upgrade ,they even have a monitor on the from desk showing you what you will get to upgrade. I am sorry but I've been to many resorts and so have the people we travel with and this was the first time ever that something like this had happened. Never down grade your guest never. If we had not been informed on our reservation , we would have stayed in the standard room or payed again to be upgraded.

I have travelled lots, most recently on cruises. This was our first resort stay in several years and this was chosen because our oldest was getting married on the beach on April 20, 2010. Arrival/check in was a gong show. As we had 3 people in our room and requested to be near the remainder of the wedding party, the hotel put us in the back corner below the roof top hot-tub - not sufficient - despite being called an \"ocean view junior suite\" - you could only see a portion of the ocean. So, we were told that the hotel had overbooked (common response to a number in our group). After some feet stompin' by my wife, we were moved to a closer ocean view junior suite. Tilo, the bellman, was wonderful figuring this out for us. The hotel is in serious need of upgrade/attention. Our air conditioning did not work for the first 3 nights. Thank goodness it was raining, because it would have been intollerable at 30c outside. It was tankfully fixed, but it was either on or off - you get the point. The fixtures in the room are all worn, the bathroom needs attention and so do most of the furniture in the lobby/common areas. Food - the buffet has to be the worst I have ever encountered while travelling. I won't go into details suffice to say that several members of our part got violently ill after eating there. Again, I get it, food is subjective, but this was beyond being subjective. Despite being told that there are 7 restaurants at this resort, there really is only 3 (the buffet, the Italian, and the Mexican), the other 4 that they refer to as \"restaurants\" are the \"pool grill\" which is basically a wealth of heating trays of food such as hamburgers and hotdogs (I wonder if that's where we got sick from); the sushi bar (not really a restaurant); the 24 hour (older food from the buffet); the Tiki bar (which is basically food from the buffet as well). The 24 hour room service menu is okay, but don't expect it fast - one order took 1.5 hours to arrive, and when it did, it was cold. On the note of the room service, if you are in an Ocean View or lower category, you are only permitted to order room service once per day - something they neglect to telly you when you check in. We should have seriously opted from the all inclusive package with this hotel, as it's not worth the major dollars that WestJet Vacations/Air Canada Vacations charge for this place (or Real resorts for that matter). For a few more dollars, move accross the street to the Royal. Which brings me to another item - no more than three times did ask us if we wanted to \"upgrade\" to the Royal - to me \"upgrade\" means free, what they should say is \"upsell\", because there is a surcharge to move over to the Royal. We took the upsell and for a mere $300 extra for 6 nights, we were moved into a far superior resort - the two resorts cannot compare which is truly sad. I can go on about the resort, but suffice to say if you want a better experience in Playa, move to the Royal!", "Date": "April 24, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Colorado", "Title": "\u201cA fantastic time, despite 3 days of rain!\u201d", "Author": "1happykat", "ReviewID": "UR62010999", "Content": "After many, many hours of research, I settled on the Gran Porto Real for our 11th Anniversary trip.

I found the Hotel to be extremely well located to walk along the beach or on the 5th avenue. Be aware the merchants are tenacious. Hotel architecture is nice and charming. There is only 6 restaurants in the hotel. There was demolition and then construction outside (adding 2 palapas) and inside (at the main restaurant) while we were there. I was offered a drink only once in the whole week by the exterior barman/barmaid. Personnal is friendly and smilly. Beach is dirty with algeas or other garbages (2 litres plastic bottle floating around, plastic wraps) We cut ourselves on the rocks even if the water at the beach is only 1 to 3 feet deep we were often unable to locate the numerous rocks. Water shoes are a must. The beach is dropping about 4 feet ( see photo) so you can not see your child from the chairs and can not bring your chair near by. I suspect sea is taking back the sand and then when you enter the water it drops again another feet or so. They constructed a pier to try to slower the waves but even with this we were always deported near the boats (and their anchors). For the price charged it is very deceiving. If you like to swim in the ocean, go elsewhere. see photos In the rooms the electrical switches were not cleaned, the door knobs where sticky and the lamps (we called them larva lamps-see photo) on the night tables where intermittent. I desinfected these but if hygiene is important to you go elsewhere or do a complain at front desk to have them cleaned. I upgraded from a standard room on the roof near the small cold pool on street side to a junior suite on beach side and was charged 400$ us (+ tax 480$ us ) for 5 days and found out on the return flight some did upgrade for 250$ wich means you can not trust the front desk because if they feel they can take advantage of you, they will. To my opinion if I can not trust hotel administration and its front desk better go elsewhere. Food was very good with a large choice and disponibility and restaurant personnel is very friendly and professional. Most important thing is that we did not get sick. Beds in standard rooms were more confortable then the king size bed in the junior suite. There was ants in both bathrooms. Showers, toilets, sinks, hot water, windows and doors, TV, fridges and A/C were all working fine. Honestly, they should put Safes with electronic codes in all room and get rid of the safe with the keys. I would recommend the hotel for someone who prefer to swim in the pools rather than swim in the sea and for the food, drinks, personnal (except front desk).", "Date": "April 11, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "interior bc", "Title": "\u201cIt was a wonderful resort\u201d", "Author": "Tracy B", "ReviewID": "UR61004709", "Content": "Check in: sorry don't remember,had a bit of a train wreck on the plane, my friends however said it was great.

It's been over a year since we've been to this hotel but still wanted to write about it. Seems with most hotels in Mexico, once you get past the front counter, the rest of the time is very relaxing. Our original room was scheduled to be ocean view. We decided to upgrade to ocean front. The first night they put us on the first floor so we had no view of ocean. They re-located us the second night, unfortunately it was right above the kitchen so our alarm clock came about 4am every morning. We just wanted to settle in so we dealt with the noise after that. The room was still very nice and spacious for a family of four. If you get away fron the kitchen, it would be very relaxing. Now that that's out of the way, the rest of our stay was awesome! The weather was actually sunnier than the other two times we went to Cancun. I realize Cancun has a new beach but Gran Porto has an area similar to a small wave machine great for young children getting over their fears of the ocean with a huge sand area for walking and exploring. We saw some beautiful private yatches and a boat that reminded me of the Star of India that would anchor overnight. It was pretty cool to see these vessels lite up at night. Our first night, we were served by Isreal and Majuheal. If he's still there, have Mahujeal make you a spider, grasshopper, cricket, or balloon animal. You will be impressed by his talent to make something out of nothing you'd never expect. We had to visit Mahujeal almost every night just to see what he came up with next. Isreal is very cordial and greated us (by name) with a smile every time we saw him whether we were eating there or not. Our poolside server was Jose most of the time. I don't think I ever saw him without a smile. He kept our family entertained and worked hard to keep everyone he served happy and laughing. The resort was very quite. Unlike Cancun hotels, you didn't have to rush to the pool to get a spot before they're gone. Most of the time the pool and beach areas were barely half full giving us plenty of room to have privacy if desired. They also have a swim up bar on second floor but was a little too cold to enjoy since it was on the shade side of hotel. It does have real cool windows underneath where we were able to get pictures of our kids under water similar to a fish tank. For some reason, there were many different nationalities represented there, I don't know if it is common but it sure is fun. It was a lot of fun trying to figure out where they were from when you'd hear another dialect. We meet some great people from Finland. Luckily they spoke better English than we spoke Finnish. It was nice to talk to other nationalities and learn about their culture rather than talk to Americans most of the time in Cancun. I love America but really enjoy learning about other countries. The food was good but by the end of the trip it started tasting the same and the drinks weren't as strong as other visits to Cancun but they were still good. It's definately not about the drinking with us anyway. Kind've eliminates seeing a lot of drunks which is nice for families, too. Sometimes, the pool gets too crowded in Cancun for kids our age to enjoy. The entertainment staff was very friendly and worked extremely hard. The activities are similar to the other resorts but not as crowded. We didn't do any siteseeing this trip but understand it's a pretty easy daytrip to many areas. I believe Cozumel is a 45 minute fairy ride away. The Royal (adult resort) is right across the street and looked very nice. Unfortunately, no kids period. We thought we'd take a peak with our kids and were turned away at the entry. We got to go over without the kids for a few minutes one day, looked very relaxing. The flee market or 5th street (I believe) is right up the street. Fun for a while but a typical flee market. Buyer Beware! If you're looking for some place to stretch out and relax without the crowds, this is the place to go. Your kids will be safe, which helps parents relax more. Just make sure to stay away from the room over the kitchen. We will probably go back but still enjoy Cancun. Had a hard time deciding between Cancun and Playa this year but decided on Cancun. We probaly be back to Playa next year.", "Date": "March 14, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "vancouver island", "Title": "\u201cAbsolutley the best holiday we have had!\u201d", "Author": "sookie75", "ReviewID": "UR58590891", "Content": "We have just come back from a 7 day stay at the Gran Porto Real, and it was truly wonderful.

Our 9 year old daughter had a great time going to the kids club, and she kept going back because of one very special girl Paty. Our 8 year old son and 12 year old nephew prefered to join in the outdoor activities where he quickly became friends with \"Chicken\" (Victor) He was wonderful with the 2 boys,and ended up playing board games with them. The beach was beautiful, the pool was the perfect temp. Service for all of the the restaurants was excellent. These folks really love what they do and it shows. The only negative things I have to say about our stay was the noise from the nightclub on the Saturday night that we arrived, and that when I tried to use the payphone with a calling card, I was unseccessfull, even after getting assistance from 3 staff members. They were not going to give up until I was able to reach my contact. They eventually sent a fax, I was not going to pay $4.00 per minute to use the phone in the room.

We were not offered an upgrade to the Royal. The bellman helped us with our luggage and showed us how everything in the room worked. When we walked in our room, it was exactly like the photos, it was very clean, and smelled good - just like you expect your tropical oasis to smell like. I was pleaseantly surprised to find a walk in closet with plenty of hangers and shelves for storing our clothing. The safe is located in the closet as well and fits a lap top no problem. Our maid Sylvia surprised us every day with beautiful towel art and our room was very well kept. Our room number was 347 and we like to sleep with the patio door open, but we did have problems with the disco from the Blue Parrot music till like 4AM every night, but I think we got used to it after the 3 or 4th night. There were no robes in the room but when I asked for them, they were promtly brought. Food We ate at the Italian twice and both times the food was really good, the problem I had with this place is that it is very loud, I prefer a quiet place for evening meal. They ran out of red wine, on the second night we were there so we never went back. Marie's was great, Salvador explained what everything was and his attention to detail was much appreciated. We ate here four times, and had something different each night, and each night the meal was excellent, from start to finish. Beware of the hot sauce - they serve it on the side and it is HOT!!! This was my favorite place to eat. You have to have a Myan Coffee served here - the show is spectacular - the coffee is soooo good. Buffet - I enjoyed the buffet, things could have been a bit hotter, but that is always the nature for buffets. I liked the different theme nights, and enjoyed trying all new things, thats the great part about all inclusive - you can take a chance on whatever suits your fancy and not worry about not likeing it, just try something else. Great opprotunity to be adventurests here as there were so many choices at every meal. The Italian and Mexican nights were my favorite. We did use room service, but only for breakfast - it wasn't always hot, but it was tasty. Something I did find was that if you wanted something for either room service or in the resteraunts or buffet and you don't see it - ask for it and they will get it for you. No problems. Staff Can't say enough about how hard the wait staff on the beach - kudos ot Pablo - no matter how big the crowd -he gets it done with a big smile. Jose - in the pool bar at night great guy and lots of fun. I wasn't impressed with the lobby bartenders or the wait staff, bad attitudes - and we were tippers every time we went. Pools- We didn't use these much, but the water in the main pool was warm, the water is the 3rd floor pool - so cold you couldn't put your feet in but it was a nice quiet place and the shushi was good although limited to 3 varieties. The top floor hot tub - you need to go at least once for the view at sunset - awesome. Beach There is a good size drop off that could be dangerous for kids, parents have to keep a close eye on them. The beach is rocky, you need to bring your water shoes, but it is warm. Every morning big conk shells wash ashore, its like a treasure hunt every day to find them. I loved it. Here is a tip for Trip Advisor Junkies - if you are in a room that doesn't have a designated beach bed and you want one, there are four that are not numbered. They are located near the bar on the beach - the four beds closest to the pier. Great place for quiet relaxing days. Very comfy way to spend the day. Spa We had a cloudy day but it was warm and we were in and out of the water all day and I didn't apply enough sunscreen and burnt my chest and forehead real bad. I went to the spa for an after sun facial that was so refreshing and cooling and whatever they use helped me heal quickly. First time I had a facial where they give you a hand and foot massage too. Overall I liked this resort a lot, but like other reviews I have read here, I was disappointed in the amount of resturants. What they did have was very good, but still - they should be more honest with thier hotel details. I would go back here though because the wait staff is awesome, the food they did have was very good, the location is great being so close to 5th AVe, the decor is beautiful.", "Date": "March 1, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "1", "Sleep Quality": "1", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Minnesota", "Title": "\u201cGet a room on the top floor\u201d", "Author": "juba30", "ReviewID": "UR57252623", "Content": "This was our first trip to this lcation. We stayed Feb. 16 to 25th in a Jr. Grand Suite walk out. Our suite had a reserved palapa on the beach. Unfortunately the reserved palapas are all in the back row so any ocean view is obstructed by the free palapas constructed in front of them. Our room (suite) had a very obstructed view and could best be described as partial ocean with obstructed view. We had no problem at check in and got the style of room that we had requested and paid for. Of course we were immediately offered an opportunity to upgarde but declined. Had we known about the view we would have initially requested a less expensive room on a higher floor and got a better unobstructed view. One thing about the rooms, they are concrete, marble and plaster with no soundproofing so noise echos down the hallways. You may want to take something to dampen the noise for sleeping. Our room had an excellent airconditioner so we ran it to counteract the outside noise. The food was adequate, void of any real flavor. Waitstaff was extremely customer oriented and were willing to please. Beach waiters were excellent but like other people commented, tipping brought them around more frequently. Wife took advantage of the Spa area. The massage was good but the faclities are lacking. Again there was no soundproofing so all conversations between all Spa goers could be heard by all. The Spa like the gym area has a moldy or mildew aroma. I thought the gym was less than adequate and the two weight machines were old and did not work properly. This facility has a staff to keep children entertained and seems to do it with pool activitites and crafts. The beach has been rebuilt from a previous hurricane. There is about a five foot drop to the water so if you travel with small children watch them. In the water it is very rocky so you may want to take someting for your feet to avoid stubbing a toe or maybe cutting a toe on a sharp rock. The shopping area is convenient to the hotel but many or almost all shops now have set prices so deals of the century are a thing of the past.

The claimed \"healthy bar\" restaurant consists ot 2 plates of sushi at a bar. That is not a restaurant. The other restaurant was apparantly a beach restaurant which has not been there since the hurricane 4 or 5 years ago. Room service apparently is also considered a restaurant. The 8th \"restaurant\" consists of the 3 tables outside of the pool bar (even though you cannot order any food at these tables). When I expressed our concerns about this to the sales people and the concierge, I was asked to write a letter outlining my concerns and assured that I would hear back by the next day. I did a letter and to date no one has even acknowledged my letter. I suppose we should consider ourselves lucky at our room allocation. We reserved an ocean front room and used the online bookin in advance and got the room we ordered. From what we heard from other guests, from hearing complaints at the front desk and some of the reviews on tripadvisor, many others seem to have had problems getting the room types they reserved. Our room was very nice. It was large, the view was terrific. Maid service was excellent. Servers on the beach and in the restaurants were excellent for the most part. My compliments to the omlette lady (sorry I didnt get her name). There were some problems with construction and repair noise but not bad on our part of the hotel. The main construction was on the other side of the hotel. Spa staff was very good. We enjoyed the fitness room although it could use some new equipment. Overall the hotel is good. We paid a premium price for the ocean front room and feel that was worth it. Our only real complaint is that the listings misrepresent the hotel by stating it has 8 restaurants when it only has 3.

We planned a vacation with friends this yr. and because of the price increase we had to choose The Gran Porto Real instead. We flew with Air Canada and used Cancun Valet for a private transfer. We all used the online check in with 3 couples in Oceanfront and 2 couples in a Jr. Suite. Check in is suppose to be smooth when you do this which is a joke. The 2 rooms in the Jr. Suite catagory were offered a upgrade for $30.00 a day p.p. They said no thank you and got 2 rooms over the building construction. If jackhammers and banging all day works for you book a Jr. Suite. They went back to the front desk to request a room change and they just kept saying no even when one room had no hot water.After the 3rd time a new Supervisor was on duty and he gave them a free upgrade to a oceanview room. We couldn't get our Oceanfront room that we paid for and booked with the online check in because they didn't have any. They gave us a Family suite overlooking the pier with a king size bed and bunk beds with 2 balconys. It was a nice room but they said we had to get out the next day as a family was coming in. We had to go back in the morning to see what room we could get. They put us in room 227 but we couldn't get in till 4:00PM because someone was sick in there and wouldn't get out. :-0 We had to get out of the family suite so they could clean it so we basically had no room for half a day. Thank God we had our friends so we could put our things in their room. They also moved our other friends with the Oceanfront so we could all be together. We thought that was very nice until there door broke. They couldn't get out from the inside of the room. Three rooms had to have someone come and reset the safe with them coming to our room twice. I have to give credit to the maids as they did an amazing job. The room smelled of bleach which made me happy. Two of our friends got really sick for one day but we aren't sure what happened there. We did Xplore the day before and it was lots of fun. 5th Ave is so close we loved that. We went to watch the hockey game one night with both the end zone and tequila barrel having a full house. There was alot of Canadians showing their Country pride. The Canada/U.S game we watched at Legends. It is off 5th and had a nice patio with a T.V facing out. It was a great place to watch the game with a full house also. Everything is in walking distance and that is the best thing about this resort. Out of ten of us 0 liked the food. The beach service is very good and both Benito and Pablo work very hard to please everyone. They have security on the beach 24 hrs. I know you can't compare a 4* to a 5* but The Gran Porto Real dosn't come close to the Royal in all aspects. We won't be back.

After waiting for 2 or more hours in the lobby and traveling since 3am we just wanted a room, they put us in a garden view suite which actually faced the street and was above the kids play area. No garden at all. The whole inside of the patio was full of bugs which I had to kill, they must have had the window open for days, one of our beds had hair in it and we had 1 coffee cup and no coffee. Nice room huh.They told us that was an ocean view room, my husband said \"What is your idea of an ocean view anyway?\" To make a loooooong and horrible story shorter, we were told the hotel over booked (not our fault and don't want to hear excuses) and we were to come down to the desk each morning between 11 and noon to see if they had a room for us. We did not get into a different room until Monday night at dinner time! We got there the Friday before. When things go wrong you are supposed to be able to go to your Worry Free representative because that is who we used, she did absolutely NOTHING for us! My husband and I had to fight for the first four days of our vacation to get the actual room we paid for. We were unable to take the girls on any tours because we had to keep checking with the front desk to see if they had a room or not. Funny how they don't know \"IF\" they have a room or not. I will NEVER use Worry Free again so keep this in mind people, nor will I ever stay at the Gran Porto Real. I have worked in Hotels for 14 years and I have never seen such a cluster of people who did not know what the h*** they were doing, OR did they ever once try to compensate for the problem that was their fault! I really do not have anything good to say about the place either, it was nothing to brag about, the only good restaurant was the Italian one up the street, food not impressive or very good. The beach was terrible and rocky and fullof sea weed crap so we went to the Real sister property next door every day and used the beach over there. The pools were cold and the oneon the roof never had anyone in it the whole week we were there because of the cold temperature. The hot tub on the roof was only luke warm like bath water, it should have been 100-104 degrees. The staff needs a good round of customer service training and how to treat their customers rather than hiding in the back office to avoid us. I am a firm believer in you get what you pay for but for $5000.00 this was an absolute joke. NEVER AGAIN.

This time, our room (#313) turned out to be hidden in the elevator alcove, and was tiny \u2013we are certain it was originally intended to be a storage room. Our \"ocean view\" faced the street, although if you went all the way out to the edge of the tiny balcony and looked sharply to the right, you could kind of see the ocean at the end of the street. After a night of listening to guests talking loudly as they waited at our door for the elevator and horns honking on the street below we asked to be moved to a different room. After many \"sorry, no\" excuses and much determination on our part, we were eventually moved to a room still facing the street (#146), yet much closer to the ocean so that it could at least be considered an \"ocean view\". The newer room was larger than the closet room (we were told that room 213 is equally tiny), yet nothing compared to the amazing room from our previous visit. Most reviews say the buffet food was great, however we found it to be mediocre and mostly cold. Maybe the challenges with our room dampened our spirit.

Rooms: We upgraded to the Oceanfront suite, which was very spacious and had a king size bed. The bathroom was also very nice, with a large walk in shower, and a large sink area. The suite also came with a DVD player, an Ipod dock and a 30\" LCD TV. The room also has a fridge stocked with water, pop and beer( which got restocked every morning) as well as a stocked bar. The upgrade to the oceanview or oceanfront suite is definetly worth it! Beach: Recent beach restoration in the area has added up to 50 to 60 feet of beach at this resort, meaning there is always space to get your feet in the sand. Service: The service at this resort is absolutely amazing. The waiting staff at the beach/pool area are very friendly, especially Pablo and Jesus. Room service was also quick and very friendly as well. Housekeeping: The housekeeping staff are very accomodating. We were travelling with our 2 yr old daughter, whose naptime seemed to coincide with the cleaning schedule for our room, but our housekeeper would always skip our room until naptime was over and promptly return to clean our room. Activities: The nightly entertainment was held outdoors most nights, as long as the weather held up. This added a lot to the experience. The activity staff were always by the pool encouraging people to play volleyball or dance lessons etc. but were never pushy about it. The Kid's Club was very good for kids 4 and up. Kids under 4 were allowed in, but had to be supervised by an adult. Food: With this resort being a smaller resort, I wasn't expecting a lot from the buffet. Breakfast was always pretty standard, fresh omelette, eggs, bacon etc. and lots of fruit, but nothing that really took my breath away. Lunch at the buffet was about the same, so most of the time we just went to the poolside snack bar for burgers, hot dogs, nachos etc. which didn't dissapoint. Dinner at the buffet was hit and miss, one night was really good, the next was not. The Italian a la carte was pretty good, with unique presentation and very good taste. I recommend the caprese salad, the beef steak with green pepper sauce, the canneloni, and the salmon, which were all quite good. The Mexican a la carte was also quite good, but a little on the spicy side. Still a very good restaraunt though. Overall: I would certainly recommend this property to anyone travelling with children, the spacious beach and great pool area, combined with the kind staff at the kid's club make it hard for the kids to run out of things to do. This resort is also in a great location for anyone looking to take in the sights and sounds of 5th avenue. A 2 minute walk takes you to the heart of the shopping/restaraunt district.

The rooms were soooo spacious, ours was a beach front. The staff are SO hard working, friendly with genuine smiles on their faces. Pleasure to be a part of that. There was beach construction for the 1st week we were there, but did not upset us because the pool was really good. We could have used the beach next door at The Palace but did not need to, we had plenty of good times in the pool. The 2nd week (beach construction terminated) we did manage to go in the Hocean...and did some serious sea shell hunting and enjoyed the waves. We also rented a car and went snorkelling (2nd year we do this) in Akumal...and actually got to swim with the turtles...(well they stayed there, we did the swimming) and saw plenty of fish along the reefs. We had 2 weeks of great weather. The Porto Real is really nicely situated for anyone who wants to go for a walk on 5th avenue at night and see their nite life. Its a 5 minute walk to the Ave....and its fun just to see. We were in Playa del Carmen last year and stayed at the hotel zone and to be honest, I preferred this year because of the access to the 5th....The staff at the hotel were all so nice and friendly, helpful. Benito and Jose kept our drinks replenished at all times and so happy to be around. The servers in the buffet room were all really helpful and the food was very good and plenty.

The location is great - just a block or so from 5th Avenue shopping district and walking distance to the Cozumel ferry pier. The hotel also has bicycles available for exploring the town, which we enjoyed several times - once guided by hotel staff and later on our own. The newly restored white sand beach is finished and beautiful, with great pool area and activities staff. We always felt very safe - even at night walking on the beach there was hotel staff keeping an eye out for you. We actually loved the buffet! We are fairly picky \"health food\" eaters (no meat, low salt, low fat, minimally processed, etc), and were worried about healthy restaurant food choices while travelling. We found that the GPR buffet always included a great choice of fresh fruit, vegetables, salads, vegetarian selections, and seafood (as well as plenty of other heartier fare for meat and dessert lovers). We always intended to try the other 2 fancier restaurants, but chose the buffet each time (even on my birthday, when we found they were serving 4 kinds of ceviche!) as we liked the ability to preview and control what and how much went on the plate. We were not travelling with children, but the hotel appears to be very family friendly with lots of kids' activities available. There were also nightly music/dance productions every evening on an outdoor stage set up by the pool, so you really didn't have to leave for entertainment. The onsite travel services with Best Day were very convenient and helpful in arranging any side trip excursions - we arranged day trips to Chichen-Itza, Tulum, Coba, and Rio Secreto - all of which provided pick-up right in front of the hotel. We really had a wonderful time and wouldn't hesitate to return to GPR. Our ONLY (and minor) negative comment would be the fairly persistent time-share/vacation club pitch. Our vacation time was limited, and we really did not want to give up any of it for a sales presentation. We said 'no\", but did have to do so several times. It is still a great vacation resort, and we were otherwise very happy with our choice of Gran Porto Real.

Just to give readers an update, the massive beach reconstruction appears to be approx 95% complete as of Jan 24 and it looks marvellous! The other construction is the conversion of existing office space into hotel units. This amounted to 12 hour days of jackhammers in stereo beginning at 8:00 am. To be honest it didn't bother me abit because it motivated me to get out of my room to enjoy the delights of Playa del Carmen. It also appears that the noisy construction is over and further inconveniences should be minimal. I could be repetitive to other reviewers and describe my experiences regarding staff, food, hospitality etc....but let me suffice to say that every aspect was exceptional. A couple of random thoughts 1. As I travelled alone, I considered the basic \"Standard Room\" to be sufficient for my needs. Actually it was. However after a couple of days walking many miles around Playa del Carmen, I would have given my right arm to lie down in a tub. The Standard Room only has a shower. 2. BEWARE....BEWARE...BEWARE. Sorry for the headline but I want all future travellers to Gran Porto Real to understand that after they register at the hotel they will be told that they are to meet one of the Vacation Consultants. (or whatever their official name is). These Consultants are in an open area just off from the Registration area. These Ladies and Gentleman have one purpose and that is to lighten your wallet by $5,000 or more. They are SMOOTH professional high pressure sales people who have the advantage of greeting you after a long stressful flight. Your guard is down....and their Charm is over the top. It is important that you refuse to meet these people.....or perhaps do as I did and tell them that I might see them in a couple of days if I run out of things to do. Another BEWARE.......after I declined their invitation for a breakfast the next day......I was given a special card that would allow me 10% savings at some gift shops. I took the card to get rid of the Consultant but almost flipped when I read the fine print on the back of the card saying that failure to return the card on leaving would result in a $30 charge to my account. 3. A great mixture of folks from around the world and my unscientific evaluation was approx 40% Canadian, 40% American...a smattering of fine Brits and a collection from European countries.

We showed them the invoices etc via my daughter's laptop that she had taken with us.They phoned the Air Canda rep (Caroline)which I found out afterwards from her and she explained that I had paid for 4 persons in a Ocean view Jr Suite...but the reception never informed me that they had called her however they tried unsuccessfully to tell me that Grand Porto had not been paid for 4 persons to stay nor had they been paid for a Ocean view Jr suite. I showed them my visa bill online. They gave me a big runaround indicating that even though I had paid for a room with 2 double beds, I was only guaranteed a room when I booked a Air Canada vacation so initially we were sent to a room with 1 King size bed for 4 persons ( myself and 3 daughters) When I complained they said they would send me 2 cots.

And, people keep approaching you in lobby-hotel staff-to get $ from you to sign you up for the tourist tours-which we did take & enjoy the tours but it's hassle being approached all the time especially when we were on our way out of the hotel for meeting up with the tours or shopping/walking the down after dinner.", "Date": "December 7, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "edmonton, AB", "Title": "\u201cHad a blast at this resort.!!\u201d", "Author": "Dulcey", "ReviewID": "UR50436841", "Content": "We stayed at this resort from Nov 12 to the 22. Hotel was beautiful, lots of room in are room. We were suppose to have two queens in are room but ended up with one king bed. There was four of us, my Husband and two boys age 10 and 12. The 10 year old just slept with us and they brought in a cot for my 12 year old witch worked out well. They would of moved us to a different room but they would not have been ocean front. The staff in this place is amazing they really make you feel at home. Miss Jesus, Theresa, Alex in the lobby and Jamie at the swing bar, you people are really great. O I can't forget Rodrego the guy who works at the desk for the teen club, my boys had a blast with him he played countless hours of ping pong with them as well. The entertainment staff is first rate. If you go make sure you do the bike tour and then take the bikes out on your own for free to really see PDC we did this several times. Went in the the not so nice part of town for the kids to see and have a real eye opener. The last day before we left we took toys and all the beach toys we didn't want to take and gave them away to the kids over there, it was a great thing for the kids to do. We visited Tulum and Xel-ha, they were both great. We did the tour though the hotel. Found it really rushed. Next time we would go on our own. We rented a boat and a captain and a snorkel guide from the guys just on the beach. This was a lot of fun for $200 5 of us fished for three hours and snorkeled with a guide for about an hour. The sides along the coast were beautiful.. Coco Bongo's a new night club is wild but lots of fun as well. The food at the hotel is ok, we got tired of it in the end. The Italian restaurant is was really good we ate there about three times. Maria's we didn't care for. The Main buffet Had great breakfast and lunch, but some of the suppers weren't so good.. We wald down the beach and ate at the fusion and took in the fire show that was cool kids liked that. Also down the beach is a restaurant called Wickey, they have the best burgers. Try the Wicked burger. I still dream about it it was amazing. The only thing we didn't like about the hotel is they cleaned are room so late, like 4 -5 in the evening some days, and the people in the lobby trying to get you to do the Royal breakfast. Which we did get roped into doing for the free t-shirt, wrap, bag and $75 dollars to use in the hotel. They were real friendly to you to try and get you to do the breakfast but once you go and don't buy in their not so friendly anymore. This hotel could do away with this. The night entertainment wasn't the best some evening either.

This was our 5th time staying at the Gran Porto Real and we are already looking forward to next year. The staff at this resort is the reason we keep coming back, they are like family to us now. They are the hardest working people around so please remember to TIP them! Even though the resort says tips are include they all deserve tips. The beach/pool staff are the best; Pablo, Jose, Bonito, Carolina, Jesus & Theresa will take care of you all day. Our most favorite bartender that we go back year after year to see is Jose A. He even remembers our same drinks that we have every year. We can't forget Miguel L. This year he went out of his was to set up a \"Special Dinner\" for my husband and I. The cook, capitan, two waiters and Miguel met us outside the resturant and brought us a dinner that wasn't even on the menu and then finished the meal with the flamming mayan coffee. It is quit the show if you chose to ask for it. So just remember if you tip a little and treat the staff like you would your friends, they will go out of their way to make your vacation that much more memerable. The Capitan's also take really good care of you. Alonzo & Eliazar always went out of their way to see if everything was ok and got us anything we need. Everyone there take care of you 24/7 Another favorite thing about this resort is the location. 5th Ave is a must see! Never a dull moment there. Also the fishing boats that are along the beach add so much character to the area. Every year we have the guys take us out on their boat. We've gone snorkling and fishing with them. It's nice because it's always just us or a few other people on the tours. We love visiting with the fishermen and they even remember us every year.

Because of some mix-up in accommodations (which we knew about before arrived) we stayed each night at the Gran Porto Real (family resort), but had full access privileges to The Royal (adult resort) across the street and spent our days at the beach and pool there. The staff at both locations were tremendous \u2013 very friendly and very much wanting to make sure our needs were met. The waiters at some of the restaurants really did not know what some of the dishes they served were, but were helpful anyway. Francisco, at Maria\u2019s (a Mexican restaurant) was outstanding! A great guy who seemed to enjoy serving us as much as we enjoyed being served. In general, the food was very good, and there was plenty of it. As well, the drinks were excellent! There are better brands of liquor at The Royal so if that is what you are in to, you might want to stay there instead of the Gran Porto. Also, the last few storms have not been too kind to the beach at the Gran Porto so if you want a lot of sand on your beach, check out The Royal. Both facilities were always kept very clean and seemed very up-to-date. I got up early each morning to watch the sunrise and would see the staff already hard at work lining up the beach chairs, raking the sand, cleaning the pools, etc. Everything was always spotless, and our rooms were immaculate each day. We received great help from Carol at Farnesi Travel in planning our trip, as well as the guys at Olympus in Mexico who got us to and from the airport in Cancun. Playa del Carmen seems like a nice little sleepy tourist town. Although we did not go out into the town in the evening (safety was not an issue, just felt like staying at the resorts) we did go shopping a couple of times along 5th Avenue and even walked up to Wal-Mart for some good prices on quality tequila.

The waitstaff around the pool and beach are the hardest working people I have ever met. Maria was our number one girl for service.

The resort was perfectly located if you want to be near town yet not bothered by town. Everything within walking distance if you wanted to do some local shopping. The resort and its grounds were spotless and very well maintained. Our room was always very clean and we even had our beds turned down in the evening - an extra unexpected touch! The sports and entertainment crew put on excellent evening shows and worked very hard during the day to keep things hopping around the pool. Thanks to Julio and Chicken especially!

We used Best Day Travel to book our excursions, we did \"Xplor\" and it is well worth the money if you do the ziplines! There are 15 of them and 3 of them you land in water in a river in a cave. Then we did the \"Tulum, Xel-Ha all inclusive combo\" It is where you go to the Mayan ruins at Tulum in the morning and the natural water park Xel-Ha in the afternoon. Tulum was the most beautiful place I have ever been in my life! and Xel-Ha is fun if you like to snorkle, if not then don't go. We like to snorkle but I would recomend a tour of the reef over this, plus we were snorkling and a 4 foot baracuuda swam about 2 feet infront of our face so we got out pretty quick. As for the beach at the resort it is nice and relaxing, yes there are boats and yes there are sand bags but it didn't bother us one bit. If you are wanting a party beach walk 100 yards down to the Royal and what ever resort is next to it it is much larger and no sand bags and is all young in shape people partying and playing beach sports. The food at the resort is pretty good. Room service wasn't the best in the world, if you want a normal lunch like hamburgers and hotdogs you will need to go to the beach snack bar. Il Pascatore the italian resturant was very good and Marias was average to me. But hey when your drinking and everything is already paid for food is food to me. Overall we can't wait to return!

We stayed at the Gran Porto Real. We arrived around 1:30ish and our room was not yet ready, no big deal to us, as check in wasn't until 3pm. The bellman took our bags to storage, the front desk gave us our bracelets and the servers came by with drinks. We headed to the buffet restaurant at the hotel for some lunch. The food was delicious. So much to choose from. We did frequent that restaurant most days for lunch and breakfast...again, a nice selection everyday, the fruits and salad bar stayed the same, but the hot selections changed daily and that was so nice. The pool area was so relaxing and beautiful. Just to be able to sit at the pool and see the ocean everyday and feel the cool breeze off the ocean - it was heaven! The poolside servers were wonderful - especially Carolina. She was just smiling and smiling the whole time and always made daily chit chat with us. Service was very prompt and the frozen drinks were DELISH!!!!! We always made it a point to throw a few dollars each day to the servers, even though gratuity was included. My friend and I were both servers and it's not an easy job, especially in the hot sun. We also hung out at the inside bar, David was the greatest bartender - our drinks weren't even 100% empty and he had another yummy drink waiting for us. We also made friends with Maria, the cocktail waitress - she was such a joy to chat with. Everyone was just so nice. We also had dinner at the Mexcian and Italian restaurant on property. Again, wonderful service, delicious food and I think the best part was the strolling mariachi bands.....it just made you feel so at home. We also went to 5th Ave to shop a few nights. TAKE SMALL AMERICAN DOLLARS when you go to Mexico. The hotel didnt have small bills to change out and it was a bit of a pain when you wanted to barter with street vendors or leave tips for servers, drivers, guides, etc. Sometimes if you paid in bigger bills for items, you got peso's back and you can't barter with pesos. I wish someone would have told us about taking smaller bills....it would have made things easier for sure. Another thing I liked so much about this hotel was the activities board. It was posted daily and we pretty much planned our day around the activities. One day we took the kayak tour. You were set up in two man kayaks and a guide went with you...we just paddled out to the sea and talked and looked for some sea life..stingrays, turtles, etc. Now, you didn't have to take a guide, you could sign a kayak out anytime, for 2 hours...and it was free, which was super nice. We also signed out snorkle masks and snorkles one afternoon and just swam the ocean looking for sea life. again...free for two hours. The also had nightly entertainment, theater productions, outdoor shopping, etc. You really never have to leave this resort, as so much was going on. My favorite part of the vacation was the massages on the beach. My friend and I both work 2 jobs, run an at home business and are just busy working gals. We decided to treat ourselves to massages. they had quite a few different types to chose from..we selected the Two for Two package. You got two different types of massages, we both got the lower body relaxation and upper body deep tissue. We met our \"Massage Queens\" at the gazebo on the beach at sunset. we had our swim suits on and Francise and Magda got underway.......can we say HEAVEN!!!! It was by far the best massage I have ever had. It was so relaxing and being on the ocean, feeling the breeze, hearing the ocean waves...it was just the best evening ever. Both ladies were most accommodating, and so skilled at massage therapy - I asked Magda if she would consider moving to the states - it was that GREAT!!! The price was great and the best 50 mins of relaxation ever! Thanks again Madge and Francis. Overall, I HIGHYT recommend this property. It was great for a girlfriends getaway, and we did see a lot of families and couples as well.

This was our 3rd time at the Gran Porto Real. I had checked in online before arriving at the resort and we were booked in a Junior Suite Beach Front Walk Out room. I intentionaly wanted to upgrade to the Gran Master 1 Bedroom Suite when we arrived and requested it. Freddy (bell boy) was fantastic and showed us what our original room would have been (in case we did want it) and then showed us a very small 1 Bedroom suite (I was under the impression there were only 2 of these suites, room # 257 & # 357) but this one was on the 2nd floor and was really small. They let us go eat lunch while we waited for room # 257 to be vacated buy the previous guests so we could look at it. After seeing the room, we took it and had to wait about an hour for it to be cleaned but that was fine, went to the upstairs pool, got a drink and put our tired feet in the cool wonderful water! Room: Obviously was fantastic, huge, 3 balconies. They put a cot in the living room for our daughter (16yrs old) but she choose to sleep on the couch. Having 2 seperate rooms when you have teenager(s) is the smartest thing a person can do. She could fall asleep when she wanted and could watch what she wanted on TV without it affecting us at all and the living room had its own seperate air conditioning so she could keep it colder than the bedroom. I usually wake up early when on vacation and the lounge chair off the living room balcony was fantastic for reading a book in the morning before everyone got up. My only complaint was the time that our room got cleaned. We would go for breakfast, go back to the room and then head to the pool till lunch time. When we would go to the room to get changed for lunch, the maid would just be starting, so we only got our room cleaned a couple times (put the Do Not Disturb Sign on the door) Ok so enough of that. Food: Good. Even though we had the 1 bedroom suite & had full access to the Royal next door (our All Inclusive bracelet was actually a Royal Bracelet) we never made it over there. We do not eat seafood at all (any of us) so there were a few times that there was not much to pick from at supper. But there was always room service and breakfast & lunch were always great. On our last night our waiter Fernando found out we didn't like seafood and told us he would get us something special and he came back with 3 beef dishes for us. Ivan was fantastic at breakfast. Service: Overall everyone is FANTASTIC. Everyone has a smile & says hola. Felipe at the upstairs pool bar is great and that is where we spent the majority of our time. So the biggest thing I love about this resort is the location. I love to shop and we ae right around the corner from 5th Ave so I could shop all I wanted. We went to Coco Bongo's and that is by far the best night of my trip. What a great time. Highly recommend it to everyone & anyone regardless of age. (over 18) My daughter & I rented Jet Ski's out front of The Royal for an hour and had a BLAST. We booked Jungle Jim's ATV's online before going and booked a Flex Pass so we could decide what day we wanted to do it once we got to Mexico. The concierge desk was great, they called Jungle Jim's to arrange our pick up. That excursion was great, got to swin in an open cenote, and go to Atkun Chen (they had spider monkeys that you could feed, parrots that you could walk right up to and take pictures and a long time on the ATV's. Make sure you bring sunglasses and a bandana. It gets dusty. We also went to Lapis Jewelery Factory. Free to go there, arrange it with Best Day tours our your rep.

We had a great time and the entertainment staff was amazing. We participated in some of the \"daytime\" events like pool volleyball and water aerobics and then went on the \"nighttime\" excursions to different bars in Playa. I strongly recommend COCO BONGO!!! Best expericence!!! Now I'll describe some of the hotels ammenities: Room: Always clean and well stocked with water and pop. We even asked for extra water and from that day on we had extra water added each day. The beer in the room is sick...but maybe that was our taste. Downstairs Pool: very nice and the service while we were lounging was great. Jesus never let the glass go empty or the ice melt! There was also a bar in the middle that was good to go to when we needed a break from the sun. And there was a buffet restaurant that they set up at lunch until around 5 that had hamburgers, hotdogs, nachos, etc. Only downfall to downstairs pool...sometimes it would be come overrun by kids... Upstairs Pool: It was smaller and supposed to be adults only (but there were usually a few kids in there). There was a swim-up bar that was our favorite...we spent many afternoons/evening there! But watch out , Filipe makes his drinks strong!!! PS do not eat the sushi. Regular resturant: Met expectations for a resort hotel in Mexico. Breakfast was good...made to order omlets and waffles! Dinner always had a different theme. Italian restaurant: Our favorite. Probably ate here 3 nights at least! Great pizzas and pasta dishes...and the presentation was amazing! Mexican restarunt: Nothing special...only ate here once. 24 hour room: stocked with beer, wine, champaigne, liquor, and a fountain bar...and random snack type food. There was a pool table, air hockey, and WiFi. Also, this room had A/C! Beach: The Gran Porto's beach isnt the best in comparison but its not bad...it is really close to the boats that the locals take out to go fishing. And part of the beach has started to wash away. (i was told hurricane wilma in 2005 is partly to blame) There are kayaks you can take out for free and there is a bar with swings as the seats which also has chips and salsa at it all day. The hotels location was great. We walked down to 5th Avenue for shopping and down 5th avenue was a ferry stop. we took the ferry to cozumel to swim with dolphins at Dolphin Discovery!!

I had no idea what to expect but my travel agent recommended it....I brought my husband and my 9 month old son to this resort for a long weekend to celebrate my husbands 30th bday. The hotel was just fabulous -- so warm and welcoming. Everyone went above what should be expected of someone in terms of service. They were so kind. The food was AMAZING! If someone was disappointed then I think they live a very privileged life and probably have an overeating problem as the food was more than adequate. We liked the buffet the best as we had a baby with us. We tried room service twice and did not like it either time, so I do not recommend that although if you go all inclusive you can get it twice per day plus meals. There is a little sushi bar next to the swim out bar which was a nice snack plus several grills out by the pool and ocean. The ocean was great! We swam several times. I know people are upset about the boats but I really think if people understood that up until 10-15 years ago playa del carmen was just a very sleepy fishing town -- that is its livelihood! We loved seeing the locals in action. It is half touristy town / half just people living in Mexico making a life for themselves. We were not bothered at all. And the infamous sandbags -- I think its great they are trying to preserve what they have left after Hurricane Wilma. They are rebuilding the beach and bringing in sand but need bags to keep it from washing away. My advice is to climb over them and swim!! Some parts were rocky but mostly if you walk another 5 feet it is sandy and clean. They also have tour guides and excursion agents on staff, but we did not use them. I booked through other agencies for cheaper tours. We did an Express Tulum tour which was AWESOME. You must go if not for the Mayan Ruins then for the BEACH!!!! Bring your bathing suit! The hotel is right of Quinta Avenida (5th Avenue) where there are markets, bars, music, pubs, restaurants etc --- gorgeous at night. We felt completely safe on the main streets and went down every night just for the atmosphere. Cozumel is a 45 minute ferry ride away -- the ferry is about 10 blocks from Gran Porto Real. We never made it as we loved staying by the pool all day, but next time we will go. We are planning a trip for next September/October and will be bringing extended family with us. Its a magical place. Remember its Mexico and its not Italy -- There are some bugs here and there and don't drink the water outside of the resort. All in all I would give it 10 out of 10.

The First Choice Rep is aware of this and has told the manager that the upgrade option is not really necessary unless you really want a room with a better view or a bigger suite.

After the hour long cab ride from Cancun, when we pulled up to the Real Playa, there was a sign directing all visitors to the Gran Porto because this was closed for renavations. ( To be honest, I had read reviews from people who had paid extra to move there and wanted to check into it anyway) So we were happy about that . Once we were in our room , which actually wasn't that great, it faced the back side street and the bed was painfully hard, after a few minutes of checking out the hotel and all its amenities the plain room just didn't matter anymore, we know we weren't going to be spending much time there. This hotel had everything and then some, from free from service to a full sized bar in our room with full size bottles of liqueur along with the free mini bar that was stocked daily in the room. We stayed 10 days and after the 5th nite we upgraded too a junior suite, ocean view for an extra 20 dollars a nite, and really the only reason we did that was because I could not sleep in the bad in our room anymore. Anyway, while my hubby took diving lessons out of the lobby, I was kept more than busy with things to do at the hotel (painting class, learning Spanish) and on 5th avenue, which was only a few close steps away from where it started. Wonderful shopping ( my FAVORITE thing to do) We paid for the cheapest all-inclusive hotel in town, and were treated to what had to be close to the nicest hotel in town, so we were extremely happy . We have been to many different Mexican resorts, and the people who worked here were very helpful and friendly and just all around pleasant. (except maby the morning shift) The only negatives here were of course, the time share fellows in the lobby, and I hesitate call this a negative was the first room we were put in. It was extremely plain and although both myself and my husband called every morning to see if there was ANYTHING that might be done about the bed, because each morning I woke up almost in tears from the mattress, and was basically ignored about it.. But after a dip in the pool that was right outside our room I was fine, The room we moved to was a totally different story. The mattress, perfect, the view, better than perfect, At night we could watch the fire-dancers from the resort next door, which was pretty cool. The food was wonderful, except surprisingly for the Mexican restaurant. It was too foo-foo, I wasn't sure what I was ordering, and when it came it was as if they had spent more time trying to make it look like some art platter instead of making it look like something we wanted to eat. But the Itallian was yummy, and the main restaurant smorgasbord was always well stocked with a wide variety of dishes and desserts. After we returned home I had to check and see how much we had been saved by their renovating the Real Playa, and it was well over 1000.00.

It would be so nice if we could swim right in front without being stuck in sand bags and rocks. And the little boats should be moved 100 feet away. But if you cross the dock and go by the Royal, the beach is amazing. Keep on walking and you will be on Coco Beach (#1 beach in Playa in my opinion).

Through this literature we were led to believe that we would be staying at an all inclusive resort with all the services and amenities that come when travelling to a 4/4.5 star resort. Our disappointment began as soon as we walked through the main entrance to the reception desk at 11:30 am local time. There was no Nolitours representative to greet us, we were asked for a credit card for imprint, our rooms were not ready \u2013 we were told in no uncertain terms that check-in was at 3 pm, there was no courtesy suite in which to change or leave our carry on luggage. We were basically left in the lobby with our luggage until our rooms were finally ready, which was well after the 3 pm check-in. It begs the question of why, when you are fully aware of the check-in time, would you schedule a flight from Toronto at 6:15 am? For all intents and purposes, we found ourselves in a hotel portraying itself as an all inclusive resort. All five couples had booked Standard rooms . Two couples in our party had concerns \u2013 one had to upgrade to a Junior Suite due to mobility issues, the other was put into a room that could only politely be described as a Studio, suitable for 1 traveller. This couple was informed by the front desk staff that they did indeed have a Standard room and were told they would be moved only when the couple explained they had already seen what the rest of us had. As far as our accommodations are concerned, although clean, there was no dresser and extremely limited closet space. In every other resort at which we have stayed, the Standard rooms have been at minimum, the size of the Junior Suites offered at the Gran Porto Real \u2013 at no extra cost. We had to wait until the following morning to speak to the Nolitours representative, who when told about our issues, said that she would write down our concerns but didn\u2019t think that anything would be done \u2013 not a comforting thought, nor outstanding customer service. When we questioned the 4/4.5 star rating, we were told that the rating was to Mexican, not Canadian standards. When told that the rating standards were misleading, all we got was a shrug and a change of subject. Considering we trust tour operators to be honest and forthcoming, why would you not make a distinction in your literature regarding the rating standards that have been used or at the very least, downgrade the rating to one that would conform to Canadian standards? The buffet for breakfast & lunch was OK, but sub-standard for dinner. The dinner buffet was a hit and miss affair, with little variety and much repetition. Our only consolation was that we could dine at the Mexican & Italian restaurants as often as we liked. A couple examples/differences with which we were faced, there was no bacon available at breakfast, no carving stations during dinner, nor ice cream for dessert at lunch or dinner. We were finally told the day before we left that we had to ask the serving staff specifically for bacon and ice cream- as if it was a special treat, saved for only for a very chosen few guests. Although relatively small issues, these are illustrative of the many differences we noticed, which continued to accumulate throughout our stay. The representative stated that there were visiting privileges with the Royal across the street. The reality was that we had to have a voucher to be allowed to have breakfast or lunch only and when we tried to enter to look at the lobby & go into the gift shop, we were stopped, questioned, told we were not allowed in and essentially made to feel like criminals. We have never been to an all inclusive resort where we were asked for our room numbers every time we wanted something to drink or eat \u2013 at all other resorts, the wrist band has always been enough for staff to know that we \u201cbelong\u201d. In fact, one of our party was told that if anyone could not produce their wristband prior to departure, they would be charged $100.00 USD. The front desk staff literally cut off our bands, gave us vouchers that we had to show if we wanted to get coffee or anything to eat and then collected them as we were boarding the bus to the airport! The measures taken by the staff at the resort throughout our stay were far more stringent than those taken by security staff at the airport. All in all, we felt mislead us in terms of the calibre of resort we had chosen. We paid comparable rates to the RIU or Gran Bahia Principe Resorts \u2013 where we have stayed all the previous years \u2013 and received nowhere near the quality of accommodations, services or amenities. Furthermore, due to flight times we lost 2 days of our vacation because they were dedicated to travel. The advertising stated that all the resorts Nolitours offers have been checked thoroughly and truly reflect what travellers can expect when choosing a destination \u2013 in our case, our choice did not match the expectation presented in the literature. As a result of the abovementioned factors, we will not return to the Gran Porto Real.", "Date": "October 5, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Missouri", "Title": "\u201cWonderful experience & will return again!!!\u201d", "Author": "Mikatco", "ReviewID": "UR45510407", "Content": "We arrived at the GPR on Sept. 19th and stayed until Sept. 23rd.

The room and bathroom were very spacious with a big walk in shower, stocked refrigerator and liquor dispenser. The furnishings were very nice. We quickly unpacked, changed clothes and headed to the beach and lunch. Food at the beach bar was about the same each day but a pretty good variety and was good. Hung around the pool for awhile and watched the activities but ended up on the beach where it was a little quieter. Pool chairs were always available and could usually find one in the shade and really didn't notice the towel game going on. Walked the beach to the Royal and although their beach isn't as rocky and doesn't have the sand whales we liked the beach area at the GPR better. The GPR had more beach space and less foot traffic. We went up to the tranquil pool late afternoon and it was very nice to have the shade and quiet time. Usually ended up there each afternoon. We went back to clean up and had a knock on our door and they brought us a beautiful cake and a bottle of champane and glasses to celebrate that this trip was my birthday present. A huge surprise and the cake was excellent, we never got around to drinking the champagne because the drinks flowed continually everywhere in the hotel. We ate at the Mexican restaurant that evening and the food and service were excellent.

The next morning I got up and walked up to 5th avenuie to check out Veronica's massage that I had heard had good massages. I was able to get right in and for $30.00 for an hour had a wonderful massage, in air conditioning and nice relaxing music. I recommend and would go back. Went back to the room and showered and off to the buffet for brunch. Food and service was excellent again. Spent the afternoon on the beach, relaxing, swimming and kayaking. That evening we ate at the Italian restaurant and it was very good, and was our favorite restaurant although all the food was good. Next morning we were up and had breakfast and took a cab to the ferry for $3.00 and went to Coxumel for the day. I had pre-rented a car with Isis and that was quick and easy and we were off around the island. Stopped at Coconuts for Guacomole and drinks. What a view and really neat place. Continued on south down the east side of the island and stopped at Marleys and had another drink and shared the fresh fish filet tacos. Very yummy!! We continued off in search of a place to snorkel. We went to Playa Corona and spent some time snorkeling there and saw tons of fish. We snacked again with Chicken Fajitas and they were good and a huge serving. Took the car back and Margarite had told us where to get gas prior to bringing it back or she would look at the tank and estimate the amount which is what we did and she was extremely fair with it. We would definitely rent from her again. Caught the 5:00 ferry back and walked 5th in the daylight back to the hotel. We snacked for dinner at the buffet since we had eaten so much during the day and we really were not hungry. The evening buffet was good and a lot of variety where everyone should be able to find plenty of what they would like. We watched the show that night and it was pretty good, it was entertaining and we enjoyed it. The next day was our last full day and we spent the day on the beach, relaxing, walking the beach and playing in the ocean before going to the tranquil pool prior to cleaning up for dinner. Met some nice people everytime we were up there but this day we met a lovely young couple from England and they joined us for dinner that night at the Italian restaurant. We had a wonderful dinner and great company from our new friends. Had to go back up to 5th avenue for some last minute shopping before leaving the next morning. We had breakfast prior to checking out and it was easy check out and back to the airport and easy trip home. We loved everything about this hotel. It was beautiful, good food ,EXCELLENT SERVICE, and great location. We didn't tour the Royal and I am sure it is wonderful but we loved the Gran Porto Real and would not upgrade to the Royal given a choice. If I had to complain about anything it would be the beach with the sand whales and the amount of rocks in the ocean which I knew about it and it would not keep me from returning to this hotel. I wish I had taken my water shoes because it would have been a little easier. I still loved the beach and you are able to find a large area without the rocks and you can always walk next door to the Royal and swim. They will even let you take the wave boards over there for an hour at a time. This was a short trip for us and was just to rest and relax after a very stressful summer so next time we will spend more time exploring the town of PDC and we would definitely return to the Gran Porto Real.", "Date": "September 30, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "nederland", "Title": "\u201cperfect\u201d", "Author": "rieksmarion", "ReviewID": "UR45461416", "Content": "we are from the nertherlands and we have travelled a lot but this hotel is absolutely the top!

The only thing I would stay about the room was it was a little small with no private balcony, we had a terrace at the front which was overlooking the road and hotel opposite but to be honest we did spend much time in the room so not a problem. We had a small pool outside our room with a swim up bar, nice and quiet when the main pool was busy although the a bit in the shade in the afternoons. Unfortunately had to get up early to put the towels on the sunbeds, we didnt at first but after a couple of mornings thought if you cant beat them join them!! Towel service was really good, fresh everyday. Waiter service at the pool side, very attentive, especially if you give them a little tip. The swimming pools were great, quite cold but so cold to cool off in the hot sun. The pools were stunning, palm trees and the beach hut pool bar. The pool pretty much on the beach. I didnt spend a lot of time on the beach, there were sandbags and boats which werent as scenic as I would have liked but I prefer the pool anyway and spent most days on a sunbed by the pool. The entertainment during the day was good, water aerobics and pool volleyball and lots of other activities if you wanted to join in. The evening entertainment was ok.. a little repetitive, we did venture out one night down the beach to a bar for a bit of a change and went on an excursion one day to a natural 'water park' which had a show in the evening. The location was ok..some bars and restaurants nearby.. wish we had ventured out a little more, but was only there for one week, after a 11 hour flight should probably have stayed longer. We stayed all inclusive and on the whole the food was very good. I'm not the biggest fan of buffets but there was plenty of selection of different foods, some cooked to order and everything was warm and clean. I really liked that there was a choice of sit down restaurants included in the all inclusive, Mexican and French restaurants, we had no problems getting a seat. The service was very quick, I didnt exactly feel rushed but I'd have liked to be able to take my time a little more with dinner. Understandable though given the amount of people at the resort. I didnt like the wine, I'm not usually too fussy with wine but I couldnt drink it. If drinking beer I'd go for the bottled one rather than on tap- it had scaly bits in! On the plus side though, there was a good selection of spirits and cocktails which I liked a little too much I think, its definately not watered down!! On the whole a wonderful holiday.

It had been about 5 years since my last visit to this hotel so I was not sure what to expect. Most reviews were positive yet there some negative reviews, specially with the type of rooms assign at checking time. To my surprise, I got the room I requested so I guess I got lucky. Even though the room was great, it was starting to show its age, specially the bad room. Service:The best part of this hotel is the people, they were great. I can't say enough about them. Very friendly and quick to respond to any issues I had. Food: They have 3 restaurant, only one opens for breakfast, lunch and dinner. The other two only for dinner. For me the best one was the Italian restaurant follow by the buffet and last the Mexican restaurant. There is another self serving restaurant on the beach that serves hamburger, hot dogs, nachos and fruit. My kids love it. There is a dress code for the Italian and Mexican restaurant, however, it is not as strict as before. The pool area: At the time we were there, you needed to get up at a decent time to reserve a good chair by the pool. By noon, all chairs were taken. So I started reserving my chairs everyday until a wise guy stole my towels. The problem was not the chairs but the towels themselves. The hotels will charge you $30.00 a towel if you don't return them when you leave. I spoke with the security guard and he told me they had the same issues with other people in the last few days so he just replaced the towels. He told me not to leave the towels alone on the chairs and to place shows on top of them. It worked, I didn't have a problem after that or maybe was the fact they increased the number of security guards walking around the pool. With regards to the pool itself, it was good. However after 4:00 pm or so the water got extremely hot so if you wanted to cool off the pool was not the place. The beach: As some have commented, the hotel is loosing its beach. They added bags of sand and created steps for you to get in but sooner or later you will step into the rocks. I have two small children and it was just not possible for them to swim there. However as other have commented you can walk about 100 yards to an area you can swim. So everyday we would walk in the morning to that area, stay for a few hours and go back to the hotel. However, it could be a problem if you need to use the restroom or need a drink to go back and forth. So if you are beach person, this is not a place for you. Cleanliness: Workers are constantly cleaning every square inch of everything in this hotel so no issues there The hotel lost power several nights and one time it was out most of the night and part of the next day, no big deal but the generators did make a lot of noise at night. My biggest issue was the beach area. I usually go to Cancun for the beach not the pool. According to the staff, they will bring sand from another location to cover the missing area. However, I think this plan will fail. I just don't see how they can keep the sand from moving.

Overall, we had a great trip and would recommend the resort to familys looking for a quaint, all-inclusive, authentic trip to Mexico. Location: Certainly the best location in Playa (along with their 5 star, adult-only sister resort Royal across the street). The resort is right off of Constituentes (sp) and a block from the famous 5th Avenue. Lotts of great eateries, restaurants, bars, and shops can be found within a minutes' walk. Plus, you are only a short 15 mintue walk from the ferry to Cozumel. Beach: The hotel has many rooms right on the beach, literally about 20-30 yards from the water in some places. The beach is a little rocky and there are small reefs right off the beach. If you love to snorkel right off the beach, then this is great (we did). If you are looking for soft sand with walk-in beach (for the little ones), then this beach here is not ideal. Not to worry though. You can walk about 100 yards North, across the pier, to the Royal beach. Here, there is no rocks or reefs to worry about and the kids can walk into the water easily. We actually like the fact that you could enjoy BOTH types of beaches so close to one another. Further South down the beach, closer to the GPR pool and beach buffet, there are fishing boats. Personally, I thought it was kinda neat having them there but I would have been upset if our rooms were closer to this end of the resort. Basically, if you are a pool person, get a room closer to this South end of the resort. If you are a beach person, get the rooms on the North end. Rooms: We had a Gran Suite, first floor walkout to the beach (room 155). This room had a king bed. We had asked for 2 queens and I was a little annoyed at first during check in that our room reserved was not available. They had asked us to switch suites the next day. Well, they put in 2 walk away single beds in our room and we ended up staying because it actually worked out better. PLENTY of room. The rooms are very nice and very clean. Excellent bedding. The shower itself was larger than my entire bathroom at home. The room had two separate balconys. There were 3 hammocks right outside our balcony door on the beach. The beach bar with swings was right outside our balcony to the left. It closed at 5 so later bar noise was not a problem. We loved walking out for a dring while others in our family were showering for the evening. Two complaints with the room...1) water temperature in the shower was not able to be controlled. It was either scolding hot or cold, fluctuating constantly from one extreme to the other. 2) hallway noise was a problem. The acoustics were such that every noise from the hallway seemed to be amplified. The ceramic tile was loud as cleaning and maintence crew carts were rolled down the hall. A good set of ear plugs will take care of this problem. Service and Staff: The service was perhaps the best I have ever had at any hotel or resort. All of the staff go out of their way to take care of you. They all seem to really like their jobs, work tierelessly, and treat you like family. Special thanks to the beach waiter Jose, the entertainment/activities coordinater Julio, and Felix on the beach. There are daily activities planned and coordinated each day. Things such as town bike tour, pool volleyball, water polo, beach soccer, water aerobics, and snorkel tour are offered each day. There is a daily activities schedule listed near the pool for each day. Enterainment: Their is live entertainment each evening on Mondays thru Fridays. Singing, dancing, and various talent acts are performed at about 8:30 pm. Contrary to what other reviewers mentioned, we thought it was surprisingly good. Very good. Don't listen to the other reviews that claim it is \"cheesy\" or that it is performed by the hotel staff. These people clearly were professional dancers, gymnasts, and entertainers and NOT the regular resort staff. Cleanliness: Without a doubt, the cleanest hotel I have ever been in. Workers are constantly cleaning every square inch of everything in this hotel, including the light fixtures, the chandeliers, underneath the railings, the bamboo supports overhead at the beach bar, etc. etc. Food: Very good main buffet which is open for breakfast, lunch, and dinner. I would give it 4+/5 stars. As about as good as a buffet can be and plenty of items to choose from each day. There is also a beach buffet which has great guacamole. For dinner, there are two full service restaurants. An Italian place and a Mexican place. Both restaurants have a very nice setting and excellent service. Regarding food quality, the Italian was average at best and I was not too impressed. However, I am Italian so my standards for Italian might be a little higher than most. The Mexican was pretty good, but the menus never change and you really cannot eat there more than 2 nights without getting bored. Recommendation: maybe offer 1 or 2 different chef's specials for each night to go along with the set menu?", "Date": "August 9, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Norway", "Title": "\u201cOne of the best locations in Playa\u201d", "Author": "SabrinaNorway", "ReviewID": "UR36764099", "Content": "We travelled all the way from Norway and stayed 17 days.

We had our wedding in PDC on July 10, 2009. Our reception was at The Royal. Due to the fact that we had a few kids attending our wedding, we chose the GPR for our stay. The service at GPR was great. During the week, we had a few wedding events planned and our meeting spot was always in the lobby at GPR. The location of GPR is perfect! Honestly, I think GPR and The Royal have the best spot in downtown PDC. Now, we had many guests that stayed in other hotels in PDC. However, every time we had to meet at the lobby of GPR, the staff was always accommodating to my entire party. They allowed them to stay in the lobby, never gave anyone a hard time and overall was very understanding about the whole situation. I appreciated that a lot. About the food, it was great. No complaints. My guests that stayed at GPR also had no complaints about the food. Selection at the buffet was great. My favorite...grilled fish and paella that they served during lunch. =) The restaurants were also both very good. Honestly, I think it's best to stay at an all-inclusive for only a certain number of nights. It's always great to be able to check out other restaurants in the area...especially in PDC, since there are sooooooooo many great restaurants and hole in the wall places to try. Service was wonderful. We had an ocean front room and our first room was above the pool area. I requested to change rooms towards the pier area and they gladly did. Also, we misplaced a few items in the week (umbrella and a picture) and the staff did a fantastic job locating it in their lost and found. My only complaint is that they gave me a bit of a hard time because I had to cut off my wristband on the wedding day. I requested for another one that evening and they were almost about to charge me for it. I had to explain that I just had my wedding..had the reception at their sister hotel and did not want the wristband on any of the pictures. Basically, they gave me a new one w/o charge, but I had to put it in writing as to why I took it off. Basically, I found it very irritating. However, that was my only complaint for the whole week. I do only give it four stars because of the beach. The beach at GPR is not great. We always went to Kool Beach Club since the beach there is beautiful. It's only a few minutes walk and soooo worth it. Overall, GPR was great.

And EVERYONE we encountered who worked there was very friendly!!! I cannot say this enough. If you were relaxing by the beach you didn't have to wait long for a cold drink. I prefer cold American beer and was worried about the Mexican beer. But all was good with a lime in it! They also had many mixed drinks! Several evenings we would wander up and down 5th Ave. On the weekends there were entertainers on the streets and art work on display. Our kids are young teens so we weren't really interested in the night life. We ate at both rest. and both were good. The buffet was awesome! Especially the breakfast! Anything you could imagine! Even the snack bar out on the beach was pretty good! They had dance programs in the evening which were pretty interesting. Something different each evening. The only things I could say negative was 1)the beach - sand bags line the beach and you have to climb over them to go into the water which is a bit rocky in areas. Overall not a big deal. You could walk down the beach to all sandy areas. But the rocks at the edge made for beautiful pictures! 2)was the lack of air conditioning. The rooms have AC but pretty much everything else is open air. (There is a small game room with AC) But after a rather warm night of walking the streets I was ready for some AC but not ready to go to the room. Not a big deal though. (I'm from the Houston area and it wasn't as bad as home). 3)you could hear people in the adjoining room, especially at night. Mostly radios or tv. Both girls had fun!

We were on one of the first flights from the UK after the swine flu outbreak and there was nothing to worry about. I've never been anywhere so clean! There was constant cleaning of the hotel from top to bottom daily. We had a fantastic time and would highly recommend it to anyone of any age. There were a mixture of age groups from young families, couples and older groups. The hotel has something for everyone. We were there for two weeks of relaxation and pampering, and we got it! We stayed in a standard room which was ok. It didn't have a balcony which was probably the only downside. I would definately go for a suite next time round. The food was great! Plenty of choice at the buffet daily and the two restaurants , Mexican and Italian were good too. We would highly recommend the Italian restaurant if told to choose a favourite. The best thing was that you could eat at the restaurants as many times as you liked! Room service was included also on the all inclusive. Neither of us had any problem with the food. We've been to Egypt and Turkey and both got ill from the food. Not the case here! The pool and service around it each day was undescribable. The staff work so hard and are none stop coming around asking if you would like anything else. We took a shining to Theresa and Jesus who rotated around the beach and pool serving all guests non stop for 10 hours a day. The location of this hotel is ideal whether you are looking for a none stop party time or a chilled and relaxed holiday. 5th avenue is a 2 minute walk from the hotel where there is loads going on in the evenings, whether you are looking for nice restaurants, shops, bars, night clubs etc. There is definately something for everyone. 5th Avenue is just far enough away from the hotel as not to disturb you if you are looking for a quiet time.

GPR is located approx an 8 minutes walk from the central downtown area. Shopping, dining, drinking, nightlife, entertainment, etc... are all at your fingertips. We were with a large group for a destination wedding granted the hotel had nightly shows and entertainment it was not always what the group wanted to do, a quick walk down the street gives you endless options. The amenities at the hotel were nice, but not over the top extravagant. The main pool had great service, but does not have a swim up bar. You are also not allowed to have/carry drinks into the pool or even have them along the pool's edge. Kind of a bummer for some. Grabbing seats at the pool was sometimes a chore, and the music they played got old after awhile. The resort does have another pool on the 3rd floor rooftop that is much smaller, doesn't have much of a view, but does have a small swim up bar with approx 6-8 seats. The bartender at this bar was not half as friendly as the rest of the wait staff at the rest of the resort. My wife mentioned the spa was nice, clean, and the gym facilities were perfect for what she wanted. Being an all-inclusive resort the food left a little to be desired, but one of the main reasons I enjoy traveling is to be able to try different foods/restaurants. The buffet at the beach grill was a nice way to get out of the sun for a little while; one can only eat so many nachos and cheese. We ate at the Italian themed restaurant at the resort which offered a nice change of pace, but you must either eat early (4-5 o'clock) or rather late (9-11) if you want to miss the rush. There was a line out the door and 20 people deep one night at 6:30. We stayed in a Junior Suite with an ocean view. Which means we could see from our balcony a small postage stamp size shot of the ocean. We were in room 124, but many of our friends were on odd numbered rooms which faced the main pool and the ocean. I recommend at check in being on the 3-4th floors, in an odd numbered room for your best view, plus you get a hammock on your balcony on this side of the hotel.

First we had a room that was on the first floor to close to the lobby and pool entrance.. Very , very noisy..... But we decided to stick it out cause we didnt want to pack up. 2. COCKROACHES IN OUR ROOM YIKES........ I have been to Mexico 6 other times and have never had this happen. After about the fourth one I went to the front desk they said they would send someone over. i will get to the second part of that in the very weird section...... 3. I booked thru expedia and Best Travel was the ride carrier from the airport.... Beware these people call your room everyday at 9 am and tell you to come to the front to sign in for your ride home, this is really about getting you to sign up for there excusions. We were hounded and hounded. 4. Also beware of the \"Come tour our hotel next door scam\" THIS IS A TIME SHARE THAT DOES NOT TAKE 90 MINUTES AS PROMISED IT IS HIGH PRESSURE AND TAKES 3 HOURS..... we did not go but met others that did. 5. Maid service is anytime they get around to it. Several days they didnt clean until 6pm. Now the Very Weird....... ok so I told you that I complained about the roarches. Well they did send someone to check our room and then never got back to us or left a note or anything. But i know they came because 1 things were moved around and 2 someone drank half a beer and left it in our garbage can!!!!!!! I could nt believe it !!!!!!!! They other weird thing is and I know this is going to sound crazy but my husband and I think the room was bugged/miked. This is why. The first morning when we didn t sleep and thought about changing rooms we had just got done talking about it and the phone rings ..... it was the front desk wanting to know if we were ready to change rooms. So this continues to happen everyother day. We are in the bathroom and i say to my husband did you use my hand towel could not find it........ Not 3 minutes later a knock on the door and it was the maid with a hand towel. ..... I never asked for it or callled..... Then again with bottled water.... 2 minutes later it showed up at the door..... Far to much of a coincidence for me. Overall I would not stay at the hotel again because of the above mentioned.

We've traveled quite a bit in the past five years, including 4 other all-inclussives, India, Egypt, France, Prague, and many others. POSITIVES: Overall, we liked the resort. It's very cozy and has a personality (not like some of the cookie-cutter mega resorts where everything looks the same). It's not quite 5 starts, but it's clean and comfortable. It's also memorable. The rooms (we had a junior suite) are very nice (4 stars), clean, well-decorated, cozy. The staff is well above average for an all-inclussive. They really go out of their way to make you feel genuinely welcome. The beach and pool service was top notch (best I've ever seen). Food is good. About average for an AI. The buffet was fine however it did feel a bit limited. There was always plenty of good stuff to eat, but it was a bit limited. No big deal. The a-la-carte restaurants are OK. Nice decor and ambiance but food being just OK (pretty typical for any AI). Location is excellent. You're in a little town. Not too big and not too small. Many options for dining, shopping and going out. The resort also offers bike tours and rents out bikes for free. DEFINITELY TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THIS. The bike tour is short (free also) but takes you to a nice little secluded beach and a mayan ruin. The size of the resort is its huge advantage. We were right above the lobby so everything was just a short walk from our room. This was very very convenient, especially considering that we were staying with a 2.5 year old who takes five steps sideways for every two forward. Trust me, if you've ever stayed at a mega-restort, you probably know what it's like to be walking 10 minutes to the beach or waiting for little carts to drive you around . You fool yourself into thinking that it's OK or that you get to \"walk off the extra calories\", but in reality it sucks. It's great to be close to everything. Also, because the resort is small, you get to know people better and the whole vacation feels more personal. For example, everyone got to know our son and would call him by his name and would help us out with him every chance they got. FEW NEGATIVES: In all honesty, the beach isn't very nice, especially if there are waves. Coupled with the sandbags, many parked boats, seaweed and rocks, the beach is not very good for swimming. THIS ISN'T A MAJOR PROBLEM THOUGH because you can just walk five minutes to the left and there are many beautiful beaches for swimming. BTW, the resort beach is fine if you just want to lie under a palapa (plenty of them around). There was some loud construction on weekdays. It stopped during the weekend but was a bit annoying at times. We learned to tolerate it but it was loud enough to get on your nerves at times. Snorkling/water sports: not much snorkling here and no catamarans or windsurfing. Plenty of little sailboats and kayaks though. The beer that was being served at the bars wasn't very good. Not a big deal as you can just drink other stuff, but it wasn't a major brand like Corona or XX. OVERALL IMPRESSIONS: We would recommend the resort. The staff, the charm and the size of the resort make up for the few negatives. ADVICE: -take the free bicycle tour -take advantage of other free activities (they make your stay more fun and memorable) -find the little air-conditioned \"game room\" with the hokey table, pool table and drinks. It's slightly tucked away so look for it. It's worth it. -explore Playa del Carmen", "Date": "June 6, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Dallas", "Title": "\u201cMore amazing than the last 6 times!!!\u201d", "Author": "thesolking", "ReviewID": "UR31387856", "Content": "My wife and I were originally booked at a different hotel, but due to the swine flu all the hotels dropped their prices.

Once again he came through with our request, he always gets us what we need. Thank you Carlos! Arriving at 12:15 we were sent right up to our room. A quick change and off to see our very good friend Philipe at the upstairs pool bar. Philipe always makes sure we get what we want anywhere around the resort. Thank you and see you in November Philipe! Luis the bar manager always made sure we had really good tequila or special rum and took extra care of our drink needs. Yeah we drank alot. Jose a beach waiter always made sure we had drinks usually before we were even ready, thank you Jose. He is a great waiter. Benito also took very good care of us on the beach or at the pool. Jesus and Teresa also rock. Miguel and Jose, bartenders took great care of us in the evenings. Elizar, like all the Capitains always made sure we were having a good time and had what we needed. Once again Rene the head chef took very great care of our dining needs. He specially prepared us ceviche and other fish a few times. Everyone here remembers us everytime we go. We have stayed at 20 other all-inclusive resorts and the Gran Porto is by far in a class of it's own. Sure other resorts take care of you and are nice but not even close to this one. It was very slow due the the swine scare. Never a problem getting chairs anywhere. Usually you need to get to a chair early at most resorts, but we never saw more than about 25-30 people on the beach. Most of the staff didn't work for a few weeks because of the scare, so we tipped about twice what we usually do, and we always tip very well. The employee salaries are very minimal, they really do rely on tips. Tip the maids and put a couple of dollars in the frig for special treats.

The food was really good and there was a wide variety to choose from, be it breakfast,lunch or dinner. If we were to lazy to go to the buffet restaurant, you could also eat at the beach. The waiters Benito,Jesus,Jose and Margerita made sure we stayed hydrated during our stay at the beach. Hardworking and friendly people.

Anything ranging from sports,games and getting creative.Feel like learning some salsa moves or spanish class? They had it all! Great team, fun people! Every night they had a different theme going on at the dance-stage that made you wanna join in and dance too. Great dances were performed. At day time you could go kayaking,sailing in a tiny sailboat or snorkling. A guy named Hugo took us out snorkling and we saw amazing fish at the pier. He knew where you could spot the prettiest fish! The beach itself was okay. They had sandbags to keep the sand from washing away but that didn't stop me from going for my daily swim. The other side of the beach(where the sister-resort is) were no sandbags and is a longer and outstretched beach. It's just around the corner. Our room was very clean and every evening we were suprised to find a fine piece of \"Towel Art\" on our bed or chocolates on our pillow. Minibar was re-filled daily.

We were perfectly happy with the hotel in general, our room and the food but there were too many annoying things which stopped this from being as good as it could be. Of primary annoyance is that virtually all the staff presume that everyone is from the USA and don't bother to find out otherwise before bombarding you with a US specific approach. To be fair the staff did try to be friendly even though there were a lot of very rude guests who treated them very badly. Sadly, whilst there were some lovely US people that we met during our stay, without exception all the rude, excessively drunk and aggressive guests were from the USA and were very bad ambassadors for their country. The location was pretty good, and breakfast was reasonable and plentiful. We didn't sample the evening food as we hate 'all inclusive' deals that tie you to the same place, and anyway there were so many other places to choose from on the main restaurant strip. Wandering around the main areas of the town in the evening was a joy, and every bar and restaurant we went in during our stay was very friendly with great food. It's just a shame that the hotel itself fails to notice that not all their guests want to listen to loud music on the beach. When we did get a break from the music, all we could hear when we were trying to relax on the beach was the constant blowing of a whistle for up to an hour at a time as around a dozen people played water volleyball in the main pool. Shame that three hundred other people had to be disturbed by the activities of just 12 or so others. This hotel is good, but could be so much better.

Our room was also located on the beach we were on the 2nd floor, right below our room is where they set up for all the weddings that take place on the beach. This was wonderful and gave us a chance to see about 5 weddings that took place during the week at the resort. They go to a lot of work to set up and take down for the ceremonies. We spent most our days just laying in the beach chairs by the pool. we did try laying on the beach a few times, but found a few woman laying out european style, so we decided to move as we just weren't that comfortable having that view starring at us...if you know what I mean. The nightly entertaiment was fairly good too. The only downside is that once the entertaimnet is over, there isn't much night life left to happen, so we just hung out at the pool side bar and drank until that closed. I know we would like to have more music that is played later in the evenings and also during the day while laying out by the pool. They do play music but only have speakers on one side of the pool, so if you are on the other side you can't really hear the music or hear what they announce at times from the entertaiment crew.

We saw several sea turtle swimming as we sailed too. If you are into fishing, this is a must to try as well.

After being woken a second time in the night, with yelling, screaming and glass-smashing in the hallway outside our door, we tried asking the people to keep it down (to no avail), then calling the front desk to ask someone to look into it. Apparently no one did, as it went on all night ... we were grateful to be leaving (sans sleep) the next day. The hotel really should have provided security to look after this kind of matter, for the comfort of other guests.", "Date": "April 21, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Alberta", "Title": "\u201cVery good overall resort in the heart of Playa del Carmen!\u201d", "Author": "AlbertaSunseekers", "ReviewID": "UR28172018", "Content": "My wife and I and our two children, ages 4 and 6, stayed at this beachfront resort in Playa del Carmen from April 08/09 to April 15/09. If you like an all-inclusive resort with lots of activities, entertainment, excellent food and drinks, and minutes away from the famous 5th Avenue district, than this resort is for you. The resort is also very close to Xcaret, so it's location simply cannot be beat in the Mayan Riviera. However, if you prefer a secluded, quiet resort with ample beach space and lots of fellow tourists, then this resort is NOT for you. The real advantages to this resort are as follows: - smaller, family atmosphere with a cozy feel, and the resort itself is impeccably clean and well-staffed in evey aspect - the buffet, the grill, and the two a la carte restaurants all serve excellent, fresh food, with lots of variety - the staff is very friendly and the overall service levels are very high The disadvantages to this hotel are as follows: - the standard rooms are VERY SMALL for a family of four, there is no balcony, and there is NO bathtub in a standard room - there is very little quality beach area left here, as the hurricanes have taken their toll, and the Caribbean waters were rough here, and it is very windy every day - there is really NO swimming area for small children, as the majority of the pools are 4'9\" deep, and I was concerned with the water quality of the pools Nonetheless, I would rate this hotel 4 out of 5, and would recommend it to fellow travellers with children!

Since it is about an hour drive to the hotel, having this prearranged was the way to go. We had an absolutely beautiful room, very spacious with a few balconies facing the ocean and beach. The room was always very clean and well stocked. The beds were very comfortable and the staff were incredibly friendly and accommodating. There were often activities going on around the hotel including water activities in the pool, pottery painting, table tennis and nightly shows. The entertainment staff were enthusiastic and very pleasantly welcoming to all. I especially appreciated the way that they invloved the kids. We really enjoyed the location since we had the option of going to the beach or venturing out for a short walk to 5th Avenue for shopping, restaurants and the sights. It is also a short walk to the ferry which takes you to beautiful Cozumel in 40 minutes for a reasonable fee. We could have prebooked many tours from the hotel, but we chose to venture out and take the collectivos to a few places on our own. They were great and we enjoyed travelling with the local people. This was definitely less expensive and we met many wonderful Mexican people who shared with us some of there suggestions about where to go and what to see. The food was good. The best selection was at the hotel's buffet. There were many choices for everyone. We will definitely be back!

First, I think your opinion of this hotel will depend greatly on what your ideal \"Riviera Maya\" vacation looks like. If you are the type who is dreaming of a secluded mega resort, private and removed from the world, venturing out only on planned excursions - you probably wont like the Gran Porto Real. If however, you like to stay at a great place but experience the culture and people of the area, you will love it. For instance, while the upper part of the beach is reserved for the resort guests, the lower part (near the water) is open to tourists and locals walking by, Mexican children splashing in the ocean, etc. We loved the people watching but some may not feel it is private enough. Also, the resort is only a block away from 5th street which is the main walking street of Playa del Carmen - mostly touristy shops and restaurants (including a Starbucks) but many locals stroll there too. Grab a bike from the hotel and in a 15 minute ride you can be where the locals eat, shop and live. Also, as some have mentioned the room classifications may be somewhat deceiving. \"Oceanview\" means a room that faces the Royal resort. However, if you walk all the way out on your balcony and look to your right, down at the end of the street you can see the ocean. \"Oceanfront\" generally means facing the pool area with the ocean behind. If you want more of a real ocean view, consider the walk out rooms. Next - tips for those traveling with small children. We had 2 kids with us, ages 2 and 5. We found everyone to be very kind and helpful with the kids. They do have a kids club for ages 4 and up. My 5 year old kept asking to go back although we tried to limit it because they mostly watched movies and played video games. But it would be great for parents who need some alone time. Luckily, Grandparents came with us so that was not a problem. For the room - if you are not on the first floor be warned that there are steps half way down the hallways to the rooms. So, like for us halfway down on the third floor - we could take the stroller up the elevator but then had to carry the stroller up or down about 7 steps. So maybe ask for one near the elevator so that you dont have to do that. Kind of silly. As for dining with kids, they are welcome in any of the restaurants but we only brought them to the buffet. We did see small children at the other restaurants though. They do have high chairs. The bad things were that for every meal they have these really spindly tall wine glasses on every table with hard tile floors below - a distaster waiting to happen. However, we only had to ask once and every time we came down after, they removed them before we sat down. They do have plastic cups, plates and even silverware sitting right by the host podium when you walk in. We often just asked for a plate and filled it up at the buffet and let the kids eat by the pool or in the room. We also did room service once. Also, when you walk in they keep the tall stacks of glass plates for the buffet right at waist level of a 5 year old. We had to keep reminding him \"dont touch the plates.\" The food was very fresh and we had no worries about the kids eating it. Also, they loved drinking non-alcoholic frozen drinks! For the pool and swimming - there is a kiddie pool - it is basically just a section of the main pool that is one foot deep and has columns that keep the kids from falling in the deep end. It was great and they had loads of fun. However, do note that my 2 year old could squeeze through the last column so you still need to keep a good eye on them. There are 2 other areas that are semicircles 1 foot deep - they played in those too although there is nothing separating them from the deep water. Do note that throughout the hotel, there is beautiful tile floors - beautiful but slippery. Including the hotel room. Even the area right as you enter the hotel from the pool is this kind of tile. At least 4 times my kids had huge, feet flying out from under them, terrible head banging crashes while walking on wet floors. You may want to consider grippy water shoes or sandals and have them stay on at all times. This may also be a major consideration for other people with balance issues. There is at least 2 women who's entire job is mopping the floors - all day long so they do try.

We made mimosas (free champagne flows freely) with mango juice, creating our own \"mangimosas\" - try it!! The mexican food was good, not the best but better than expected for an all-inclusive. The view from the restaurant was fantastic, the white powdery beach is near and the beautiful Caribbean is right there. The ala carte restaurants were disappointing, with strange food combinations, very small portions, and the flavors were...bad. However, there are a multitude of great restaurants on 5th Ave, just a few blocks away. We loved La Caprichoza, and there's a Carlos and Charlie's in a great upstairs location as well. The resort staff was very gracious and accomodating, and the bartenders were good at their jobs...they would remember you after a bit and try to make your drink upon sight. The hotel itself is large, but we were very impressed with all the private-feeling places. You can find a piece of beach, or lobby, or bar, or just an alcove with seats and views of the fabulous ocean. All in all, very very pleased with our stay, and we would definitely return.

A couple, early fifties, second all-inclusive in Mexico. The location of this place is awesome. Right in the middle of everything, 2 blocks from 5th Ave. The check-in was good, got our room by 1430. Our flight was early but they gave us the bracelets just the same while we waited for the room. We had reseved a ocean front jr suite on the third floor and it was a beautiful large room room with a balcony. Time-share people, we did not see. The first night, they placed a card on our door telling us that we had an appt the morning after for 0900 with a gift. That went in the trash and we never heard of them again. The pool is very nice, water is fine and the place is cleaned everyday. A lot of the chairs have towel on them by 0600. Good bar service . Activities 2-3 times a day. The beach is also very nice with sun shelters and plenty of lounge chairs. Waiters at both the pool and the beach. Buffet hut for the afternoon with hot-dogs, burgers, fries and tortilla chips for those who do not wish to go inside for lunch. As well, there is a massage hut with 2 masseuses. Many chairs there are reserved early as well. For those who want to spend a lot of time at the beach, I would consider the suites on the first floor with walk-out to the beach, it comes with 4 lounge chairs and your own sun-shelter. No need to reserve, the back row is all for those suites with signs saying reserved by suite number. At check-in, everyone is given a card for a beach towel. You can exchange the towel when you want by the pool. Our room had a mini-fridge with 8 sodas, 2 beers and 4 small bottles of water, stocked every day. Also had a liquor dispenser with rum, vodka, gin and tequila. The bathroom was large with a shower big enough to wash a small car. TV, DVD player, clock radio and electronic safe were all working fine. A small table and 2 chairs on the balcony and a hammock as well. There are water dispensers all over the place and ice machine on all the floors and that is a nice touch. There are 2 restaurants for dinner and a buffet for breakfast, lunch and dinner. The food is good, I would give it a 3.5 out of 5. If someone stays there for 2 weeks, I can see where it would get a little boring after a while. One can buy access to the restaurants at the resort across the street, we did not. There are several restaurants on 5th Ave, we went out one night and had a good meal. As someone else mentionned earlier, this resort is managed in the most efficient manner. Everyone is working very hard, the place is cleaned from top to bottom every 24 hours. The service at the this resort is simply outstanding and I do not think that it gets any better than that. You can book excursions right there if you wish.

Overall, we had a great time and had few complaints about the trip. Transportation to the resort was PAINFULLY long. We stopped at 4 other resorts before ours, and the advertised 45 minute travel time took over an hour and a half (blame the travel agency, not the hotel, I suppose). We were met by more painfully slow service at the front desk. It took 10 minutes to get any help, and a really unreasonably long time to get checked-in, in my opinion. Not a great start to the day. Everything after that was really great, however. Our hotel room was a standard suite (base room) - faced a fairly noisy street with some construction that started at 8:30am every morning. However, the room was very clean, had nice furnishings, and was huge! For marginally more (really, not very much at all), we could have booked an Ocean View Junior Suite. Several people in our group stayed in those rooms, and I would 100% say they are worth the extra $20 per night. Beautiful rooms, nicer bathrooms, great ocean/beach views, hammock, in-room bar, etc. We sure regretted not reserving one of those rooms once we got there (there was no room to upgrade - in fact, the hotel was overbooked and sending people to the nearby Royal hotel). For breakfast, you have 3 choices: cold continental breakfast, buffet, room service. For lunch you have 4 choices: beach snack buffet, normal buffet (same as lunch, and much of the same food), sushi bar, or room service. For dinner you have 4 choices: gourmet italian, gourmet mexican, normal buffet, room service. Eating at the all-day buffet got really old after about 4 days. We ate at the gourmet restaurants most nights, but breakfast and lunch at the same buffet were too much. Overall, the food was good. There were no meals where we didn't all find something we liked. I couldn't imagine staying here for two weeks though, always with the same food - every day! Beach drink service was always great. The servers were friendly and fairly prompt. The beach buffet was overrun by seagulls. We quit trying to get any chips and guacamole (which was really delicious) after the second day when a seagull attacked one in our group carrying a plate back to the beach chair area. Our best meal at the hotel was when my boyfriend and a couple of others went deep-sea fishing through the hotel and brought back several amberjacks (similar to tuna). We had a fairly large group, and the hotel chef specially cooked one of the fish for us. They set up a large table area just for us and brought out the best fish I have ever had in my life. There were several daily activities if you wanted to participate. I had a great time on the bike tour, and others tried the kayak tour and liked that, too. The on-site snorkel gear is really crap, and there's not a whole lot to look at near the hotel as far as snorkeling goes. You'd want to go to Akumal or Cozumel for that. The pools on-site were freezing cold (I'm from Minnesota, do lap swimming in pools here, and I thought the water was unbearable...).

We would go back to this hotel for sure. That said though, there were a couple of niggling problems with our trip overall (one not even related to the hotel and I'll see if I can post it somewhere else). First, be very VERY wary of the time share people from the hotel who nab you early on. They're quite high pressure and lots of other Canadians we met said the same. A firm no for the briefing they try to get you to will hopefully keep you safe. Second, the food is only so-so although my husband liked it more than I did. My one recommendation to them would be to put in a standing pasta bar. On arrival, we bought the upgrade to get an ocean front walkout room and access to the Royal hotel restaurants across the street and found both the Asiana and Maria Marie's to be awesome. Was it worth the extra for the upgrade? Overall, I would say yes. We got the oceanfront walkout, our own palapa (this was almost worth the price itself) plus the opportunity to eat in the Royal's restaurants which we found far superior. Only downside was that while the staff inside the Royal restaurants knew by the colour of our bracelets that we were entitled to have access, the staff in the lobby and other areas did not and so we were twice questioned. Not appropriate and we were ticked about it. Made us feel less valued. I could not complete this review without mentioning the staff. Absolutely awesome, no kidding. Smiles and helpful while not being pushy. The actual cooks/chefs in the buffet were the only exception and we only noticed them because the rest of the staff were so outstanding. Special mention to Maria, our room attendant, and Benito, who worked tirelessly to keep us well supplied with drinks on the beach. Would be go back to this hotel? Yes. A very nice relaxing week. Final note concerns a non-hotel point of the trip. We booked with Sunquest and the airline is Skyservice, a charter. Each person is allowed 20 kilos of luggage (about 40 pounds) and this is really NOT A LOT. Going out was not too bad, only a few of us in the line to pay an extra 20 dollars per kilo (we were 4 kilos over going out) but coming back to Canada, the line in the airport to pay for extra luggage is substantial. Really ruined a lot of people's vacations. We talked to folks around us in the payout line and it wasn't unusual for folks to be 10 to 20 pounds over - souvenirs, etc. That means an extra 200 bucks to get on the flight to come home and there's not a thing you can do about it.", "Date": "March 6, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "bc", "Title": "\u201cawsome all inclusive over all!\u201d", "Author": "mexicana6543", "ReviewID": "UR25269942", "Content": "The gran porto real is for sure a 5* hotel!! me and my Husband came with our daughter,12 and another family with kids also , there is a couple of things you all should know. anyways heres my review! Rooms= when we first got at the gran porto real we were put into a beautiful suite with 2 double beds and a bunkbed with a huge deck, great view.we were only staying there for a night though. The next day we got put into another really nice room with a patio where you could walk out to the beach, we stayed there for 3 nights loved it!. On monday there was alot of confusion with the rooms the staff wanted to put us in a room with no windows!! of course we didnt put up with that so they put us on a room across from the pool on the roof very nice and our last room change was to a standard and it was fine. Staff= The staff at Gran porto real were fantastic! they were all very friendly and great at there job.My daughter and her friends went to the kids club sometimes and had alot of fun with the workers ! and of course the kids and activities. The chefs were awsome! awsome food , and very nice! all the waiters were so charming! they make little flowaers made out of napkins and there so sweet! The front desk had a little complications switching our room on monday because they over booked ,that was a little stressful.But all of the staf were so nice! Pool/Activities and Beach! = the pool is such a happening place to be! theres some activities and performances that were alot of fun and the beach was so nice! yess it was sand bag but who cares? ur in mexico in the sun and the sand is still that white sand that everybody loves. The ocean was a blast!! it had a couple of rocks so watch where your going but the water is so clear and blue! if u really want an adventure , on the beach u can take a boat ride out to this really BEAUTIFUL beach ughhh it was so nice! it was like a mini jungle island and the snorkling was so fun but im scared of fish but...it was fun though i hoped u liked the review! and i hope everyone who reads this goe's to the gran porto real but doesnt run into the little problems we had !!!! it was so fun though!!1", "Date": "February 27, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "saskatchewan", "Title": "\u201cLocation can't be beat!\u201d", "Author": "boomhauer", "ReviewID": "UR25169563", "Content": "I'd been to Mexico many times before but this was my first visit to the Yucatan Peninsula. I think this was an ideal place to stay as it was right in town and walking distance to everything...if you wanted to eat local food like 7 peso tacos at El Fogon, no problem. Groceries - the Mega and Walmart a very short stroll away. Of course the 5th Avenue tourist strip is right there with all its bars, clubs, restaurants, and shops. Some of those isolated resorts would have left me bored. Specifics: Rooms - we were upgraded to a larger jr. suite (after booking just the standard rms. which are MUCH smaller) but one overlooking the back of the restaurant. Not much of a view at all, but there was a balcony. Ocean front rooms would've been awesome, but ask for ocean FRONT not ocean VIEW if you want a real water scene. Mini fridge restocked daily (tip with a note if you want more beer, pop, water!) Large TV with more US channels than we expected. We wanted a king bed but got 2 singles. Wasn't ideal. Huge shower and great bathroom with hair dryer. Digital combo safe which we always like. Big closet area too. Pools - Main larger one just off the beach; another upstairs near the standard rooms (this one has the swim up and sushi bars). Hot tub (maybe 5 person?) on the roof with hammocks nearby. Have to say we were on the beach more than at the pools. Beach - Excellent. Not like Punta Cana or anything but fairly white sand. Yes, there are sandbags in one spot. Barely noticed them though. The berm kept the sea much calmer directly in front of the resort (a big deal as there are always fairly large waves near here) . You could walk out in waist deep water for a long way. Great wait service on the beach as they were always bringing more drinks. Bar near Constituyentes has no alcohol though. There are many loungers although they did tend to fill up and security won't let you drag them right down to the shore (public beach). Food: Our room was directly above the buffet/breakfast, so we always made it down. Good selection of everything from sausage/bacon to omelettes to french toast to fresh fruit (great papaya!) and yogourt. Buffet was decent midday and had a different theme every night. A la carte restaurants were Mexican and Italian. Staying so close to great local fare, we only tried the Mexican (which was really good). Best thing about these - no reservations needed ! (always a pain) Room service also included, once daily! Bars: Pool bar and lobby bar closed (I think) at around midnight. A decent menu of drinks and beers were Dos Equis on tap and Tecate Light and Sol in cans and Superior in bottles. Another great feature of this resort as most AI only include draft beers. There was a different theme of entertainment in the lobby nightly. Another bar at the upstairs pool near the standard rooms, which I think closed around sunset. There is also a 24 hour lounge with a self-serve bar incl. wine, most hard liquor, a beer tap, and coffee. They have snacks in here plus some video games, a pool table, and HDTV. You are so close to so many bar options on 5th Ave. though so it's not like you'll be spending all night on the resort. To sum up, it's a very nice property. Really loved the location, food was good, staff was friendly and attentive. I might try a boutique hotel in the area sometime but I am sure this would be more comfortable.

This facility is probably the cleanest of any that we have visited. People are constantly cleaning and picking up. The wait staff is very attentive as are the Entertainment group. The shows are OK, probably the worst of the 7 years, but there really isn't a theatre for the group to perform, rather an outdoor stage. On our last night the show was in the lobby and was a lipsync tribute to music through the decades. Our group made it fun as we sang and danced to such classics as \"YMCA\" and the soundtrack of \"Grease.\" The food was very good. The Italian restaurant was superb, while the Mexican was very good. The buffet was alright. Would have been much better if there had been a salad bar and ice cream. Only had ice cream twice during the entire week. Also the serving lines were a bit confusing as people were going to the 2 grills in the wrong direction so you had to fight the line in order to use the condiments. There should have been a sign of some sort to direct you to the proper direction. Only really big complaint that the entire group had was that the bartenders would not fill the Bubba kegs. Interesting as the resort claims to be \"going green\" but they would rather you get 5 plastic glasses of beer rather than filling the Bubba Keg. That is 5 glasses that they just throw away. Green?? I think not. Also noticed that quite a few people were sent to other resorts as the GPR was overbooked. Happened to 2 in our group. They were fortunate as they were sent to the beautiful Royal across the street, but others were sent to the sister resort downtown, a not-so-nice place.

Let me first say I was a hesitant about this hotel, never having been to Mexico before. I found it online and I poured over the reviews.Our travel agent had never been to Gran Porto before either. But it was as beautiful as the pictures .. There were a few snags. Our room wasnt ready when they said it would be ,but when we got to it , it was beautiful! We had an oceanfront suite with a spectacular view. We all stayed in one room and it was more than enough room. As far as upgrading we were never asked, never hassled. Talking to some other guests they had less than adequate accomodations We booked through an agent with Funjet and I think that had something to do with our ease of check in. There was some one there everyday from fun jet. If we had any problems they would take care of it. The only other snag was that the room was set up for 2 people , as far as towels, glassess etc., and it took a few days for them to get it that we needed enough for 4 people not 2. Other than that the staff bent over backwards for us. They were wonderful.Very friendly. If something wasnt on the buffet that we wanted, all we had to do was ask and they got it for us. We sat in the same section in the main buffet for breakfast everyday and the staff got to know us and what we liked and had it there waiting for us. As far as the food , we ate breakfast and lunch at the buffet. Dinner we would go to the Italian or Mexican resturant. We would have fresh salsa and guacomole or cheesy chili fries in the afternoon at the hut on the beach. I would stay away from the hotdogs , that is about the only thing that really wasnt good. If you were there longer than a week, the food might get mundane. The place was very clean and very well kept . Our room overlooked the pool. I read in some reviews that it was noisy. Well we didnt think so . The pool closed at 9pm and the entertainment was over by 11pm usually, so if you went to bed at 8pm and were a light sleeper, maybe it could have been a problem. The pool and beach service was great. You were barely finished with your drink and they were there asking if you needed another. The drinks were a bit light on the alcohol but still very tasty,I would just ask for a extra shot . Besides we werent there to get drunk, just to relax , and we did. The hotel was perfectly located , only a block from 5th ave. We had a great time shopping there. Just a tip, dont pay what they are asking for!.You have to learn to haggle, but thats the fun part! We also had a massage on the beach. I didnt think it was that overpriced. Besides how many times, unless your a world traveler, do you get a massage on the beach with the sounds of the ocean lulling you?All in all it was a great trip, just what we were looking for.

Things got off to a bit of a rocky start when we got to our room. One of our primary requirements of this type of vacation is a great view of the ocean, we clearly indicated this to our travel agent. She said an \"Ocean View\" room would be prefect for us (we should have questioned the \"view\" part, but the reason we were using an agent was because she was supposed to know what she was doing). Well, our room was on the first floor (130) and opened on to a fairly busy street and had a fine view of 3 floors of rooms at a hotel (The Royal) across the street. If you peeked through a bush and no one was walking by on the street you may have been able to catch a glint of ocean. I went down to the desk to (calmly) voice my disappointment, the gentleman (Gabriel) behind the counter explained the difference between \"ocean view\" and \"ocean front\" and offered to upgrade us. I was prepared for a big number but it was only $40 a night! The difference was amazing, our new room (341) was on the third floor, had a large private patio and a superb view of the ocean, all was well. I should stress that the issue was not the hotel's, our travel agent caused the problem. However, at this hotel (and likely many others in the area) the ocean \"view\" part is highly variable, if you like to see and hear the water, pony up the extra $40, and make sure the reservation says Ocean Front. As many other reviews have mentioned, this hotel is spotless. When the maid is finished, the room is always immaculate (if you leave her a buck or two, you get all manner of towel art!). Another common theme on the reviews is how good the staff is, this is also absolutely true. Everyone is very professional, courteous and friendly to boot. The food is also very good, the main buffet restaurant has very good breakfast and lunch. The dinners are also very good with a couple of different cooking/grilling stations every night. Lots of salads, veggies, appetizers, desserts. The buffet has full wait service and they are as good as you will find anywhere. There is also a Mexican and Italian restaurant, which we didn't get around to going to (couldn't bear the thought of putting on shoes and long pants). There is a beach food bar with hamburgers and the like, it is a bit variable in quality, but very convenient if you are on the beach. If you want good food then you can just go to the buffet a few steps away. The beach service is also very good, many different types of drinks. The beach waiters work very hard and are always on the move with a tray of drinks. One thing that I noticed was that very (very) few people tipped. The guys (Hola Pablo!) and girls would be slogging through the heat and sand all day bringing trays of drinks to a group and at the end of the day they would all get up and leave, no tip! A couple of bucks here and there is much appreciated, this is a fairly high end resort, folks should be able to afford the small tip (on the beach and in the restaurant). The hotel location is great, two short blocks from 5th Avenue which is a couple of miles/kms of shopping, eating & drinking. This hotel is right in the middle of the action (it is very secure and quiet at night), if you like that type of environment, then you will like the location. We talked to some folks that stayed at resorts outside of Playa and they often complained that they were in the middle of nowhere and had to take a taxi to do anything outside the resort, this is not a problem at the Proto! The beach in front of the hotel is also fine, they do have a low row of sandbags but you just step down off of them. Many of the hotels up the beach towards the ferry terminal have virtually no beach (and no sand bags). The beach area could use more shade, there are a number of sun shelters but they get taken very quickly and some of them are reserved for the beachfront walkout rooms. Portable umbrellas that could be stuck into the sand would probably solve the problem. The beach is quite busy with lots of folks walking by, many people watching opportunities. Very few beach vendors and they are not at all aggressive, we also did not run into a timeshare person all week!!! (ignore the Gold card promotion if you don't want the timeshare blah, blah). This was our first trip to Playa so we can't compare the Porto with any other local hotels, but our experience was great and we would not hesitate to recommend this hotel to family or friends.", "Date": "February 16, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "3", "Check in / front desk": "2", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Iowa", "Title": "\u201cOverall, a great place to stay\u201d", "Author": "elpeters", "ReviewID": "UR24621553", "Content": "Just returned from a 4-night stay at the Gran Porto Real.

Our room was on the east end of the resort, looking out into the street, on the third floor, so it was hardly Oceanview much less Oceanside. If you looked between The Royal resort across the street and the end of our resort, you could get a peek at the ocean. Our friends that traveled with us were not able to get their Oceanview room at check-in, even though we booked it six months in advance, so they were \"upgraded\" for the first night to a pool-side room. It was so noisy they were up all night. The next day they were moved to a room similiar to ours but on the first floor. Again, barely Oceanview. Just beware of check-in! They were not very friendly at the front desk, either, so that didn't help. As for the rocky beach, it is rocky under water where you go into the ocean from the resort's beach. You have to walk through an area of sharp rocks before you can get to a small sand bar, then the rocks are fewer and farther in between past the sand bar. You have to go out that far to \"play in the waves\" because the beach is sheltered by sandbags. We went to the beach next door at The Royal to play in the waves because it wasn't rocky at all.

Our 5th visit to Playa, our first to this resort. We originally had booked the Reef, and were \"upgraded\" to this resort as the Reef was overbooked, seemingly a natural and expected situation with them. After reading more reviews of both locations, we were all quite excited to be going to the Porto Real as it seemed to be much better by review opinions then the Reef. Airport, transfers and check in went smoothly and reasonably quickly. We were given a refreshing drink at the counter as we were checking in. We were given the option of upgrading our room to the Jr. Suite for the discounted price of $60 per night, a special price instead of the normal $80. we declined. We were suddenly put in those rooms anyway, for one night, at no additional charge and were told that we would be moved to the standard rooms the next morning. Fine, whatever. When we went into the Jr. Suite, both our mouths dropped open at how small the room was. We have always had spacious rooms at every other resort we had stayed at, so this was a surprise. The room was street side, and had a balcony. It was nice sitting out there for awhile people watching. We were moved to the standard room the next morning, and frankly we think that room was larger. But wow, it was problem after problem there. First, minor things like the tv not working, the a/c not working properly, etc. A call to the front desk and within 10 min. maintenance was there and all fixed. A/c continued to be a problem throughout.....either colder than antartica, or muggier then a sauna. Two nights in a row, no hot water. None. Nada. From the sink or the shower. We had to call the front desk each time, and within about 45 min. we had hot water. Toilet would not flush suddenly, and overflowed. ANOTHER visit to the front desk. When we got back to our room, some 6 hours later, it had not even been looked at! AND YET ANOTHER call to the front desk. Now I am not fussy, and I certainly understand that occassionally poo-poo happens. But there was never an apology, or any appearance of concern for our inconvenience. Wow. The beach was wonderful. The resorts location for beachfront is ideal. Pool was small. Swim up bar pool on the third floor is so cold you expect to see ice cubes floating around. The sushi bar is here. Every day the sushi is different, both in type and quality. Drinks were weak. I will say the pina coladas are the best!! I am dreaming about them, LOL! If you ask nicely, they will put more booze in (usually). Food is alright. I have had better and worse. For the most part I would say it was above average. the wait staff on the beach was absolutely fantastic. Always smiling, and friendly and fun. buffett waitstaff very, very nice and right there with more water, or clearing plates, etc. The time share folks are ready to pounce on you at every moment, and every turn. They are very nice and charming, but we aren't interested in time share. The Lomas reps were so fantastic. We have always gone with a competitor whose name ryhmes with \"snapple\", and the lomas travel/funjet people exceeded them in every area! We were so impressed with them. We enjoyed walking down to 5th ave. and shopping and people watching every night. That was always entertaining. we did not see any shows at the resort. The only entertainment staff that we saw was one guy who did pool aerobics every morning. That was it. There could have been more, and we just did not see them, but the resort is not real big, so it would be hard to miss that. Would I stay here again? Yes, but only if the price were right for a beachfront or oceanfront room. Under no circumstances would I stay in a streetside room again. I will poste photos in a couple of days for this.

There were positives and a few negatives which in all is probably a fair reflection of this hotel. Upon check-in the hotel were able to give us a room that we had booked - a junior suite ocean view. Room 330. We checked in about 6pm so there was no reason why our room wouldn't be ready. Later on we found the couple who checked in after us who were also on our flight didn't get the room they booked and were forced to go over to the far side facing the road. This was not a nice part of the hotel. I guess it could've been us. Our room was ok. The Real website makes it look a lot better than it was. We had a noisy fridge and 2 double beds, which wasn't ideal. The beds were quite firm too. On our balcony you could see the sea a bit, but we knew it wouldn't be ocean front as we hadn't paid for that. In all, the room was ok. Big shower but no bath, which was a bit irritating. We actually upgraded after 4 days to an Ocean Front (Room 247) and the remaining week was much more enjoyable from a room perspective. It was indeed ocean front and away from the pool and the 'evening entertainment' noise and directly over the beach which was nice. The room was the same as the ocean view room we previously were in but it had 1 king size bed which was what we wanted. The rest of the room was the same (without a noisy fridge) and the view over the lovely sea was worth paying $210 for the upgrade for 7 days. You get alcohol optics and soft drinks all inclusive but you also got that with junior suite ocean view. The only negative thing about our room was that a couple of hundred yards away down the beach was a club which played rediculously loud music until 4am! I wouldn't of been able to sleep if it wasn't for ear plugs, and that's with the door shut and the air con on! Also, any weddings they have were under our balcony so we had the treat of listening to cheesy music when a wedding was on as well as the other music. I spoke to the hotel who weren't too fussed about this issue. I'll have to say the hotel is very keen on you to upgrade and they are heavy on it. Signs everywhere for it. We did first look to upgrade to the Royal for $210 which got us the basic room which consisted of a garden view, jacuzzi bath and a hammock, if you were lucky! We hated the Royal and were given a tour by one of the 'nice' reps....who only bombarded us with the sales pitch. We got out of it and decided to just upgrade to the ocean front at the Gran. The sales people at the Gran are a bit much too and stick cards in your door saying \"Your appointment time is at 9.00am tomorrow morning. See you there\". Some folk I imagine would go down and then be stuck in the sales pitch. We were approached upon check in by Senior Willy (great name!) who told us we would qualify for discount card if we came talk to him. We dodged him. The pool was freezing! Well, it was for the first week then all of sudden it was quite nice. Perhaps the hotel forgot to heat the pool because the sea was actually warmer. There is some noise around the pool from generators but enough sun beds to go around if you wanted to move. We wanted a shady bed so we always went for that side. The sea itself and the beach were the best thing about the hotel. Really lush and very inviting. Also very shallow too. Magnificent it was. Quite hard to find a decent sun bed which is strange seeing as it's private but you get the feeling anybody came along and took a sun bed at their leisure when they weren't entitled to. The pool entertainment team were very nice even though the 'bicycle tour', 'spanish lessons' and 'cocktail making' were all a bit lame for our taste. The food I thought was really bad. Alot of the time it was cold in the buffet section. Some bizarre choices for breakfast like chicken, beef, pork and you had the feeling that anything not eaten for breakfast were just put out again for lunch. The beach 'restaurant' which again is a buffet was the worst with the same food out every day. Burgers, Hot Dogs, Nachos etc and the bread was stale and just not very appertising. Still, people were munching their way through it! The Mexican restuarant was ok i guess and the italian was the same though the food was hot! The staff were a bit hit and miss. Some people very nice and friendly, others quite rude. The guests staying at the hotel seemed to all be canadian/americans (couldn't tell the difference i'm afraid until they spoke french!) who I thought were all quite off-ish. They seemed very cleaky and I believe they return to the hotel frequently so they have an air of arrogance about them. Location wise you were 2 mins from 5th Avenue which had loads of shops and restaurants. Not too many bars, more restaurant/bars. This was good the first night but it gets very repertitive and we were quite fed up by the end of it. The shops are all expensive and you get harrassed by people which just gets annoying after a while. To go on any trips was a fortune which is a rip off. A real tourist trap. I know it must sound like we are a couple of kill joys but we have high standards and expectations and I think it's fair to say after writing this that we weren't satisified on reflection with our choice to go to the Gran Porto Real, though one or two redeeming factors save it from being a disastrous holiday.

Each time we go, we watch beautiful weddings on the beach at the resort. It was a dream come true when our daughter and her fiance told us they wanted to get married in Mexico!! We booked the trip for us and 12 others with great ease. Then the apprehension started...how was I going to coordinate a wedding all the way from Mississippi? I contacted Zulma, the Wedding Coordinator at Gran Porto Real; gave a her a little information and she said \" don't worry, it will be very simple to plan.\" I was still apprehensive....her email arrived within the hour, outlining all the details, options and prices for a beach wedding. There was also information on the legal aspects of a wedding in Mexico.Within a day or two the plans were complete. I was still apprehensive ( this IS our ONLY daughter!) On our second day of arrival, the wedding couple met with Zulma, discussed details in less than an hour, had the blood work drawn, and were seen by the doctor right there at the hotel, and they were all set! We had fun in the sun the rest of the week. Wedding Day arrived, we swam all day, then around 3pm we all began dressing for the sunset wedding. The weather was PERFECT, the breeze just right. When we arrived on the beach for the ceremony, we were speechless. It was absolutley beautiful!! The gazebo was arranged with gorgeous fresh flowers ( my daughter had many choices!!). The chairs covered with white linen, the JP was ready and waiting! We chose the cocktail reception with appetizers. The food table was elegant and delicious, the cake spectacular and the wait staff was incredible. NOT A SINGLE NEGATIVE EXPERIENCE! We could not believe how a perfect wedding could have been so easy to do. They provided the photographer, and he was excellent. He knew the timing of the sunset and took romatic photos on the beach, in the surf, etc. We ended up purchasing the entire CD of 125 photos, because each and every one of them were perfect. The music was great, and we all danced for hours. If you are planning a beach wedding, this is the place to go!! Be sure to ask for Zulma!!

We had a transition in our wedding coordinator from Paty to Micaela during the planning process but that went fairly smoothly. For the most part, I recommend communicating mostly through Micaela the wedding coordinator and Walter who is in charge of the reception and dinner. Those two and your DJ (if you have one) will take care of all your questions and needs. They are very professional and great at their job. If you like the saxaphone, I highly recommend the saxaphonist. We had him for one hour during dinner for the reception. We planned for our wedding and reception to be on the beach. We got through three main songs for the reception before it started pouring rain. That was only the second time in eight days that it rained (which it didn't last long). We ran under cover and they set us up under the outdoor hotel restaurant. It was amazing how quickly they transitioned everything. We were disapointed it rained but there was nothing that can be done about it.

We ate breakfast and lunch at the buffet restaurant every day and always enjoyed the selection. The sushi bar was also quite good although the variety was rather limited. The only downside to the resort was the quality of the performances in the evening. It was the most amateurish entertainment I've seen at a resort. One night, the entertainment included a fashion show for the boutique at the Royal across the street. Luckily, it's only a two-block walk to 5th Avenue so we we could find entertainment elsewhere. I should also mention that the musicians who performed in the lobby bar in the evening were also quite good. Some people have complained about the guest services pushing timeshares at the Royal across the street.

The Mexican restaurant being more civilised as the didn't try to give you 'bums rush' out of the the place, unlike the Italian. The staff overall could not be faulted and were genuinely friendly and helpful. We found loads to do all the cultural trips could be done cheaper on your own using either the coaches (office in main street) or the small people carrier type vans (collectivo?) down a side street somewhere between calle 17 and 20. The reception at the hotel advised us exactly where. Visited Akumel Bay using the collectivo vans, then it's just a short walk from the stop. We saw Turtles which made the holiday for us.

We couldn't have asked for a better vacation. I've noticed that a lot of reviews complain about things unrelated to the hotel (i.e. airport issues ruined trip so hotel gets bad review - what?), so I will only talk about our time at the hotel, although our time at Xcaret and on 5th avenue was fantastic as well! I will try my best to be as accurate as possible in my review: Check In: Our check in was just fine, drinks on arrival ( thanks to Freddy and Tilo!), our rooms were ready right away, and all in all was very simple and quick. Rooms: Both rooms were very similar (411 and 420) - right by the swim up bar and although not direct ocean view, a great view nonetheless. We didn't upgrade as we didn't plan on spending alot of time in the rooms (why get junior suite if you aren't going to use it?). They were small, but satisfactory, and the fridge was restocked daily. Overall, a great place to shower and get a siesta in between activites. Food: We ate a the buffet and both a la carte restaurants. Breakfast: We had breakfast at the buffet every day, and were rarely dissapointed - omlettes, eggs to order, pancakes, french toast, fruit, bacon, sausage, beans - you want it you got it. Lunch: We usually just had whatever was on the grill on the beach, which was just perfect (look out for those pinckels). We did go to the buffet once and it was perfect for lunch (pasta day). Dinner: We went to the buffet a couple times, it was alright, what you would expect from a buffet in Mexico. The Italian restaurant was delicious and the Mexican restaurant was okay. Room Service: We ordered room service a couple of times, and every time it was wonderful. Drinks: All of the drinks were great, just tell them what kind of alcohol you want and what colour you want the drinks to be - you'll be suprised every time! Staff: If nothing else, it is the staff that make this resort 5 star. Everyone was incredibly friendly and helpful - from Jesus on the beach to Willy who even found out the football scores for my boyfriend. The staff here are absolutely amazing, kind, and genuine. We cannot say enough for the staff, they made our stay exactly what we wanted it to be. The Beach/Bars/Pools: The beach was great, there were sandbags as expected, but I would rather have them there than not! We never had a problem grabbing a few chairs at any time of day at any of the bars or on the beach. The swim up bar/tranquil pool/sushi bar (great maki for Mexico) was great, except that it closed at about 5. The other bars were open later, and there was always the 24 hour club. Overall, we had a great time at this hotel and would have no problems staying here again.", "Date": "December 23, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "SF", "Title": "\u201cTerrible room inventory control\u201d", "Author": "guerne", "ReviewID": "UR22967635", "Content": "As you might expect, you select a room category by name and features.

They will offer a room next door in a lesser category or perhaps give you an upgraded room for one night and then move you the next day possibly to your category. We were booked with friends for a wedding and never did get a room in the category we paid for after battling for 3days and had to stay at their companion hotel the Royal across the street but our friends were not allowed on the property which made spending the days together problematic.

The main girl actually cried when they learned we were leaving the resort. The food was average. Nothing special. Not as much sea food as we had hoped.

We found our experience to be pretty much in sync with others experiences here. We chose to book the Junior Suite and upgrade to Oceanfront Suite upon arrival- we were able to save $$ doing it this way, but you need to be prepared to negotiate. We stayed in room 253, which like a prior post for a couple that stayed in room 353, same room setup and views. We liked this location as we were away from the pool and kitchen noise, plus had a great view. The food was acceptable- not great, but what I would expect for an AI. Breakfast was great. The lunch & dinner buffet, Mexican and Italian restaurants were not great, but very acceptable. The staffs were all very good- cleaning staff, waitstaff at the pool / beach / bars and at the buffet. Jose did a fantastic job of taking care of us at the beach- thank you!

I would say that all of the positive reviews on TA are pretty accurate, Restaurants: We had breakfast every morning at the buffet, they had a good selection of fresh fruit, an omelet bar, Fresh pancakes and French toast, eggs cooked to order, along with other breakfast type stuff. We ate at the Mexican and Italian restaurants and found both pretty good. Presentation was really nice. All in all we found then food better than most of the AI that we have stayed at. Our main complaint was that most of the food was served barely warm. The beach in front of the resort was better than I had read, yes there were sandbags and they were ugly but there still was plenty of room for walkers and sun worshipping. For $50.00 per night we upgraded to an ocean front room. Room 353, it was a really nice room with two balconies, king size bed and a really nice bathroom. Our room overlooked the old cruise ship pier, and also faced the Royal. The room had a fully stocked mini fridge with pop and beer along with 4 waters everyday. There also was a four bottle liquor dispenser. It was a little noisy in the mornings as we also faced the street. Service trucks start rolling around 5:00AM The Pools were really nice and clean and heated by the sun. The sky high hot tub was not so hot. We were disappointed about this. This area would be the one area that we think could use a lot of improvement. There is a lot of potential here. This is suppose to be an adult\u2019s only area and was not enforced. As this is the only area in the hotel that is adults only it would have been nice to see a little extra attention paid to the people who wanted to use it. Many people while we were there just turned around and walked away after seeing all of the kids. If you wanted to get a drink after 5:00 you had to walk all the way to the main bar by the main pool. About a ten minute walk one way. It also could use a lot more lighting up there as it gets dark by 5:30. The drinks were good for the most part. The hospitality/VIP room was a great idea. Beer on tap, wine, liquor, juice and pop dispenser, along with meat and cheese trays. FYI they will not fill your bubba kegs at the bar. If they see you have one on the beach they will not serve you and walk right on by. Another thing we liked about the place was the proximity to 5th Ave, about a two block walk.

ROOMS We arrived at mid-day and were very happy to find that check in was quick and easy. We were able to leave our suitcases at the reception while we grabbed a quick bite to eat, before we were taken to our beautiful rooms. We booked Ocean Front rooms, which were well worth the extra cost, our view was fantastic. The room was nice and clean, the showers huge, the bed was comfortable, and as I said, the view was gorgeous. FOOD We all loved the food at the hotel. The buffet was good, with enough variety each day to keep all 7 of us happy for the week. The two specialty restaurants were also good and there was no problems getting seats for dinner. We even ventured to the Asiana restaurant one night, at the Royal next door. Gran Porto guests receive 50% off of the price. We all loved our meals. BEACH and POOL What a beautiful beach with nice white powdery sand and there are also a few shady bits, for those who want it. There are some (small white) sandbags on the shore, but it doesn\u2019t take away from the beauty of the beach.

But before saying more about this beautiful hotel let me warn you about the SCAM AT CANCUN AIRPORT. This has nothing to do with the Gran Porto but I believe it's important to know what happened to us and to many other passengers checking in at Cancun airport. When we got to the airpot (to go back home) I decided to go to an empty check in to weight my suitcase (as I normaly do). With my big surprise, my suticase was 3 kgs heavier than what it was at the check in in London. It was supposed to be much lighter as we had finished the shampoos and the sunprotections (the souvenirs were in the hand luggage). So my friend weighted her suitcase and even in this case it was 4Kg heavier. We also noticed that, once you had taken the suitcase off the scale, it was still showing 2.7kg for a few seconds and then go back to zero! Every became clear when we saw a cashier opening right next to the check it and there were signs poppin up at every corner saying that for each Kg overweight you had to pay \u00a310 (or $20). When we went for the check in they asked us to weight our suicase together (even having a separate ticket!!!). They took away the suitcase from us and then said that we had to pay 7 kg overweight. At that point we had to fight to have our suitcase back while they were almost threatening us about the handluggage weight. We put everything we could in the hand luggage and went back to the check in, where we refused to weight the suitcase together. My suitcase was still 1kg overweight (it was 21kg!) so they asked me to pay for it. I went to the cashier and (almost furious) I gave her my credit card. She refused the payment!!!! But we can guarantee that if I gave her cash she would have taken it. Most of the people on our flight have paid. So.... make sure that all the heavy stuff is in the hand luggage, refuse to weight the suicase together and pay by card!!!! Remember: all the cash is going straight into their pockets and there is no record of it (don't be surpriesd if they want to give you a \"deal\" if you pay cash)! Don't bother calling the police, they are getting a piece of the cake. About the Gran Porto Real... I have to say thank you to Tripadvisor. We read many positive reviews and... we couldn't be happier of our choice. For reasons that I am not going to explain, we saw other hotels, and every time we were really glad that we had chosen the Gran Porto. There are other beautiful hotels on the Mayan Riviera but they are in the middle of nowhere!!! Be ready for a 30 min taxy ride to see the closest form of life. Anyway... we upgraded to a Junior suite (paying $20 more per night, to share in 2), the service was FANTASTIC, the beach is beautiful, the food is good and the location is just perfect. Some people said that the food is repetitive, please remember that you can choose from 6 different restaurants!!! Some people said that the beach is \"rocky\", well...we bought the shoes for the beach and we have NEVER used them (there are few big rocks here and there but the water is so transparent that you can just avoid them). I would just suggest to buy the tours on the 5th avenue, you will pay a third of the price,.... same thing for the massages (the spa is great but too bloody expensive!!!). Be generous with your tips, make sure you have a good amount of $1 notes... trust us...it's worthed... you will be absolutely spoilt!!! So... put a smile on your face, relax and enjoy your holiday!!!", "Date": "October 19, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Vancouve, British Columbia", "Title": "\u201cLoved It!!!!!!!!!\u201d", "Author": "par01", "ReviewID": "UR20886708", "Content": "We visited the Mayan Riviera for the first time, and it was probably the most amazing family trip ever!

You are so close to 5th ave where the action is. Walking distance easy!!!! 2 blocks. The beach did have sand bags from the storms and was a little rocky but wasn't too bad. We walked to nearby beaches and they were fine. There was some topless sunbathers so be careful if you are offended by this. Over all we had an exceptional time. The only downer was I got tired of the food. It was good but it all had the same flavor. What can I expect though if I am in Mexico. Don't book your tours at the hotel either, go to 5th ave, they are cheaper and the exact thing, in fact those who booked at 5th rode in the same van as we did.

The quality of the accomodation - everywhere you look you can see someone cleaning something. Sunbeds get scrubbed in the middle of the night. It's immaculate in every respect. The rooms were superb - large sunken baths (roman style), DVD's in every room, mini bar replenished every day, loads of space. Friendly staff - look out for Jose the waiter around the pool. He's a gem. We DID tip the waiters around the pool and on the beach but we didn't get the feeling that it was expected, quite the opposite.

We were very disappointed in several areas. I'm not sure if the price of fuel or the lack of occupancy controlled our dissapointment.. In the previous 5 yrs our visits to the Gran Porto Real have been remarkable. This year was different.. It started off by the supervisor at the front desk telling us at check in that we were going to be given a free upgrade since we were returning guests for the 6fh time. WOW we thought, until he gave us the same room we paid for anyway.. No big deal.. but didn't appreciate the hype with no reward. We also noticed the Chef's have changed at the restuarants and so with the menu's.. I guess if you have never been there before you wouldn't know the difference.. However the Food was not as good as it has been in the past. I assume with the price of fuel driving up cost everywhere, the Resort has to cut back.. Also I noticed the Resort was only about 40% occupied.. Good and Bad results with that.. Plenty of space, no lines, etc.. Services and Food were cut as expected with no revenue.. I understand but still disapointed. The one thing I can't figure out with this Hotel is why they do not cater to returning guests.. you would think as to any business they would market towards repeat business but You just don't get that feeling while your there.. 6 Years and you are treated like a first timer there.. Except for a few staff members that might remember you.. They just don't seem to care if you come back. We will try a different resort next year.. The First 5 years was great..

Thoroughly rate First Choice Airlines!!! We paid for 4 upgraded seats into Premium Cabin. Excellent legroom/seat/food/drinks/service/ pampering packs/entertainment. If you are flying charter, this is the upgrade to go for. I would not upgrade short haul, but long haul every time. Hotel was excellent location, for when you got terribly bored of the hotel food, which was repeatative and buffet (which you have as only choice for breakfast) was VERY Mexican. Fajitas, Brocolli and Spicy Fish are not my cuppa for breakfast, or my bowel!. TOP TIP _ ask for bacon from one of the waiters, for some strange reason you cannot readily get it in the counters, but in this hotel, \"you dont ask, you dont get\". Omeletes and fried eggs good. Only one toaster though, which gets a que forming. Some of the waiters in buffet are rude, but overall, the hotel staff are eager to please. Theresa/Jose on pool waitering, are very friendly and work very hard. Entertainment is there if you want it. Beach has been damaged by previous hurricanes, but 100m to your left to the other side of the pier is the \"Royal\" beach, which is fab. We went snorkelling and the kids absolutley loved the little coral reef to the side of the Swing Bar.........highly recommend this! Staff at the check in desk \"pounce\" on every guest to upgrade......... ..British customers beware! They rip us off...........I spoke to many many other guests and you need to basically barter for a good price, everyone gets quoted different prices!. We booked a Junior Suite, and on arrival upgraded to Ocean Front Suite (which basically meant that we got optics in our room and a full ocean and pool view, NO OTHER DIFFERENCE, the ocean view rooms are at the back of the hotel and \"at a push\" you can stretch your neck to see it). We paid another 60US$ a night, other couples paid 50 or 40 and an American lady I spoke to (who has been 3 times and does fantastic Beach Sculptures) was charged 30US$ and given one of the best rooms in the hotel, with huge balcony with 2 sunbeds on it, and fuit and fizzy wine in room!. The repeat guests wear black wrist bands and first timers wear yellow ones. American / Canadian guests tip regularly, to all staff. On our welcome meeting we were told tipping is not required................. again beware!............if you want good service after day one you need to tip (the staff are very assertive), otherwise you are almost blacklisted by staff, and you will be last for everything! (you have been warned). Your are supplied with a towel card for each guest which you hand over everyday to towel desk and recieve a towel - TOP TIP_ smell the towel before you accpet it!, they are very sneaky and try to give you a nicely folded \"used\" one! You will be charged 30US$ per card on departure if you do not hand in your cards to reception at check out. Use \"Best Day Tours\" based in the hotel to arrange excursions, very reliable and good value. I recommened the Tulum and Xel-ha visit. You can't go all the way the the Yucatan pinisula and not see some Mayan Temples!, and Xel-ha is a brilliant place, snorkel, dolphins, snuba, sea trek...........check out the xel-ha website before you go for an insight...............food is great there too! Our room had excellent air conditioning, mini bar re-stocked daily with 6 mineral water, 2 coke, 2 diet coke, 2 sprite, 2 fanta, and 2 bottles of beer! woopee. Ice machines are available near the lift on each floor, so you can stock up, and water machines are next to them, so if you run out, you can re-fill yourself. TOP_TIP- The pool has very high (almost excessive) Chlorine levels (I know about this due to experience with pools), Blondes beware - you'll go a tinge of green, and all white swimming costumes will also go very green. TOP_TIP - Mojito's (alcoholic drink made with Mint leaves, fresh lime, rum, sugar syrup soda water and ice) are brilliant!, give them a try. And the iced mango and orange (available either with or withour alcohol) are delicious. TOP-TIP - Ice cream not readily available, you have to go to the buffet reastaurant and ask the floor manager. No flavour choices, you get what you are given, but this should be readily available in a country where the weather was 38degrees C every day!!! Kids and adults allike needed to cool down. The pool would become very hot by 1.00pm!

Here is my review. I apologize in advance for the length. Check-In- Check-in went absolutely perfect. We had a ocean view junior suite. They asked us if we would like to either upgrade to a jacuzzi room at the Royal or an ocean walk-up at the Porto Real for an extra $150. We said we'd think about it, but would like to see our room first. Check-in is at 3:00 and this was at 11:00 so they gave us a room right away while everyone else had to wait until 3:00. After seeing our room we were more than happy with it. It was very spacious. The \"oceanview\" was more of a view looking at the Royal and turning to right to see the ocean but we didn't mind at all. Food- The food was okay, but I am a very picky eater. The buffet is your only choice besides room service for breakfast and lunch. I always found something to eat. They have great omelets, but I will warn you that one of their choices of \"ham\" is actually cut up hot dog weenie. That really grossed me out. The other shredded ham for the omelet is great though! The snack bar on the beach has great chicken wings! We never made it down to trade winds though. For dinner you can have the buffet, the italian, the mexican, or room service. We went to the buffet twice. The first time it was extremely good! The second night was a Mexican theme night and I couldn't find one thing to eat so we left and wen to the Italian. The Italian restaurant is very good! We loved it both times...but both times we got sick afterward in the middle of the night. We tried the Mexican restaurant once. It was okay. Again, I'm picky and don't like spicy foods so I opted for the beef medallion with red wine sauce and it was alright. We really enjoyed the room service food. My husband tried the fried chicken tacos and the Mexican beef strips and loved them. I got the chicken breast and it was very good! All of the restaurants had wonderful desserts. Drinks- We spent a lot of time at the bar by the pool and beach. We really liked the evening bartenders, but didn't care much for the day time bartenders. All of them make a wonderful Amaretto sour and strawberry daquiri! Jose, part of the beach side drink staff was very nice. Those guys work so hard. Walking back and forth all day long delivering drinks. Service- The service is what makes this hotel just alright. I'm the guest, yet I was always first to greet the staff with a big smile and an \"hola!\". Many times there would be no response back. There weren't many of the staff who went out of their way to be polite. We tipped everywhere we went so it's not like we didn't show appreciation to them. There were many times a tip was not deserved, but we left one anyway. We would go an entire meal and not be waited on once. One of the first days we were there we left the maid a $5 tip and came back to a room that had the comforter thrown on top of the bed and that's about it. Yet, we still left tips everyday and one day she didn't even come until we called around 5:00 to ask if someone could atleast come sweep the sand out of the bathroom. The rude staff was one of the only things to put a damper on our vacation. Beach- The beach was great! It's not huge but it worked. It's very clean. I've seen some pictures that depict it as dirty, but I woulld consider it anything but. It's not a private beach so there were locals and vendors walking by. The sand bags were not an issue at all. The water was shallow so you could walk waaayyy out there and still only be up to your hips and I'm short. We had one pretty windy day so there were big waves coming in and they were really fun to play in. Activities- Thank god for the animation team! My idea for this vacation was to lay on the beach all day. My husband is way too active to just lay around so the animation team was great for him. He took part in many of their activities every day and I got to peacefully nap on the beach for a few hours! We also visited Tulum and Xel-Ha and did parasailing with the company who had a booth right on the beach. Tulum was amazing for my husband. He's a huge history buff and loved every second of it. It was way too much walking and heat for me, but it was interesting to see. Xel-Ha was an absolute blast. We only spent 5 hours there and we could have spent an entire day. I highly recommend Xel-Ha. Parasailing was a great experience. Everyone should do it atleast once in their lifetime. We also painted a vase at the ceramic booth. It's more of a kiddie thing, but I had been sick that morning so it was a fun thing to do out of the heat. The guy that works there is so nice! By time we left we were great friends! The evening dance shows were okay. We could never get ourselves to sit thru an entire show, but it was something to watch while at the bar. Okay I think that's finally it! I would recommend this hotel if someone wanted to get away to the beach, but not be treated like 5 star guests.

This place is fabulous. From the time we arrived till the time we left it was nothing but FANTASTIC..... The arrival ~ We got to the airport fairly early around 10:30am & proceeded to get our luggage & find our shuttle. When people tell you about the herd of people outside the airport trying to sell you excursions & shuttles to the resort, they arn't kidding. Just walk past all of them & head straight for the van with your companyls name on them. The van was there to pick us up when we arrived & to our suprise with a cooler FULL of ice cold Coronas.. The drive from the airport to the resort was about 45 minutes due to having to stop at 2 other resorts before ours. When we arrived at the hotel our room was actually ready & we were able to check in well before noon... The Room ~ The rooms there are very nice size & very nicely decorated. We didn't have a ocean view unless you leaned waaay out our balcony & to the right down the street you could see a little bit. The beds were pretty comfy too which doesn't happen to much on vaca!!! The shower was wonderful! It had a really big shower that was large enough to fit 4 people..... Service ~ Everyone there was very nice & always spoke with an Hola when passing you in the halls or anywhere on the grounds.. THe food was really good too. The Italian restaurant was REALLY good. I think for a couple extra $$$$ (maybe 10) we had the lobster & filet at least 3 times during our stay.... The breakfast buffet was also nice & the food was always well prepared & hot.. Which I havve found to be a problem at other resorts. Activities ~ The daily activities at the pool were fun. Wether we were playing drunk bingo or the limbo. One of the guys there LUIS was the BEST. He went out of his way to make sure we had the best week ever. Each night he took us down 5th avenue to a different bar & to show us different stores & such... One night he even arranged a shuttle for about 8 -10 of us to go to Cancun for a night of partying. That was the highlight of the trip. We had VIP service at all the places we went & open bar. Weather ~ The weather is pretty HOTT! The sun is like no sun you have felt before. I got the best tan of my life that week & can't wait to go back... It rained at about 3pm everyday we were there for about 25 minutes & then it was gone & back to the pool we went. Might I add in case you have smaller ones ~~~~~ The beach to the left in the back of the hotel is TOPPLESS. Not too many go for it but some are not afraid..... All in all we loved this hotel! I can't wait to go back.

This was our first time at an all-inclusive so were a bit apprehensive at first. We are normally the type of travelers that stay in a room only to sleep while we are out all day. The purpose of this trip was to actually relax, as it was our honeymoon. This experience has definitely opened my eyes to this kind of vacation. The minute we arrived we received a warm welcome. We upgraded and stayed in room 352 which had an excellent location, it partially faces the Royal but also the ocean. Our room was excellent; spacious, cool and in a quiet location. It had liquor dispensers as well as the stocked fridge. Pool and Beach \u2013 service was amazing! We never had to wait for a drink. The servers are extremely friendly which made our time there more comfortable. The areas are clean and well maintained. There are sand bags on the beach but that didn\u2019t bother us since we were mainly at the pool. You can also walk further down to the Royal\u2019s beach which is nicer. Restaurants \u2013 When in the hotel we mostly had our meals at the buffet restaurant, Las Gaviotas, which offered a vast selection. We usually grabbed lunch at the outdoor buffet where we could eat by the pool. Had dinner at Maria\u2019s one night, varied menu, the food was delicious. Had dinner one night at Il Pescatore, the high end restaurant, the food was good but I found the menu a bit heavy as it had many pastas. I expected to be a bit lighter and more delicate. Overall, service was excellent at all the restaurants. Housekeeping \u2013 our room was always clean and well kept. I left a note for the refrigerator stocker person with some cash to let them know what we wanted in the fridge and it stayed that way throughout our stay. This trip was a dream come true. I based my decision to stay at this hotel from reading all the great Tripadvisor reviews. The one thing that made this AI and vacation perfect for us is it\u2019s proximity to 5th Ave. We were glad to be able to walk to all the shops, restaurants and bars. We were close enough to the colectivos (busses to Tulum) and a lavanderia where we could have our clothes laundered (much cheaper than in the hotel). Being the type of travelers that we are, I think we would have gone a little crazy if we had to get a cab every time we wanted to go outside the property. Not so in this case. This is an excellent property and the staff truly makes this place shine.

Our junior suite (street side) was very spacious and nicely decorated (pls note I'm a guy with low interior design standards...). The floor was a bit filthy when we first checked in but otherwise no issues with the room or the service. Room was well air conditioned, which was welcomed given how hot it was outside. We were pretty well stocked (fridge, towels etc.) and the staff made sculptures out of the towels, which the g/f loved). We had issues with the safe but it was quickly serviced although it took longer to fix the issue with our dvd player. Location is fanastic - right on the beach and 1 block away from 5th ave (shopping district - never take the first price...shave off 25-50%) and a few more blocks to the bar/club district on 12th Street. There's a mini-mall and a walmart within walking distance too incase your forgot something (we forgot our memory card for the camera, doh!) I thought the food was surprisingly good for a buffet style all-inclusive resort. There was sufficient variety at the buffet as well as the beach side grill (more pub fare though and lunch only). The a la carte restaurants (2 - mexican and italian) were good as well. The buffet had different food themes every night but Mexican food was never really a focal point it seemed other than nachos and the occassional item here or there (although, I guess the Mexican a la carte venue was meant to address any Mexican food cravings) - I guess I'm a purest wanting to try the local cuisine.... Activities were good but I would have liked to have seen more - e.g. casino night was over before we finished dinner. Water sports (the paid type - e.g. jet skis etc.) seemed to be lacking but a lot of day excursions were available. Activity staff were great though. The gym was sufficient and par for the course for a hotel or resort and the g/f was very happy with the spa. Overall, we liked everything about the Gran Porto - quality, service, staff, location, food. We would recommend people go to this resort. ps. be wary of the time share presentation - g/f wanted the complimentary bag/coupon/wrap so we went but it lasted longer than we would have liked.

We were staying in Playa as we had signed up to take Espanol classes. The school booked us at what they thought to be a nice hotel...Uhm, no, it was so miserable. So my twelve year old son and I, walked the beaches of Playa that whole first day. We happened upon the Gran Porto Real. We usually stay at 5 star hotels for our one fancy vaca a year, but this was not itended to be that kind of a vaca. However; we walked into the hotel, which looked like a four or five star hotel, and asked if they had availabilities. They did not until the next night. We looked at the rooms, and we were floored............they are truly beautiful, and upscale. So we signed up to arrive the next night. By the time we walked back to our first hotel, they had called us and told us they had found a room for us, that very day at 3:00pm. We packed up. and hopped in a cab, and were there at 3pm on the dot! The consierge, the employees, the manager, all so very kind, helpful and sympatico!!!!!!!!!!! We only got to stay there for our last 6 nights, but it was so amazing for the price. It truly felt like a 4 or 5vr. All inclusive, and the food was so delicious, even my son ate at the rest. There is an all around rest, an Italian, and a Mexican rest. included in the inclusive package. There are rest. all around the city you could walk to if you wanted, but we never really did, unless we were going back and forth to school. Then we might stop for a snack in town. Oh, I take that back, one night, captured by the spirit of Playa Del Carmen, we stopped at rest. to have dinner. It was pretty good food, and very enjoyable, but it cost $120.00 USD., so after that, we decided, the food was just as good at the hotel, so we would eat our main meals there. We got to know our waiters, as they remember you and say hello every time you go to their place. The specific location on the beach where this hotel is located, is the most beautiful for miles. All around it's kind of dingy and extremely rocky, but for some reason, it is less so here. We swam, kayaked, boogie boarded, sat on cababna chairs with umbrellas while served umbrella drinks for free! What a life!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Oh, so important, one could set the air conditioning in the hotel to FREEZING!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! and every now and then, we did. And the tv has many news stations, which is nice once in awhile, also. Every day when you get back to your room, the cleaning staff has created a towel decoration, like a bunny, a dog, hearts, etc. So cute, like a 5 star in Hawaii!

Also, I can't say enough about how comfortable the beds were! The beach did have sandbags, but after you step over them, you are in clear blue warm water.

We had previously stayed at the budget sister resort in Playa, The Real, and had such an amazing time we vowed to return. For the extra money you can really live in style, and the Gran Porto went way beyond our expectations! First of all, the rooms are enormous and meticulously clean. Of course, we were encouraged to upgrade but a simple \"no\" was enough and the desk staff were sweet enough to upgrade us for free as it was our honeymoon. We stayed in room 146, Junior Suite Ocean View, on the main level, and the ocean was almost close enough to touch. We spent many nights on the patio enjoying the sounds of the ocean and the free flowing bottles of rum, tequila, vodka etc that are included in the price of the suite! The shower is lined with beautiful blue tiles and is about as big as an average New York City apartment. We would return from the beach and find hibiscus flowers strewn on our bed. It was fantastic! Remember that the cleaning staff don't earn very much and rely on tips to get by, so bring along a good supply of one dollar bills. As for the beach, well, there ARE sandbags and piles of seaweed right in front of the hotel but if you walk for about 3 minutes down the beach you can find the tropical paradise you see in all of the postcards. No problem! It was always easy to find the perfect palapa and beach chairs in front of the hotel, and the beach service was really friendly (check out Claudia's smile!) and quick. Often they would bring us refills without us even asking - that's service! Try the freshly made mojitos, the bahama mamas, and mango daiquiris. (oh, and again, TIP! we noticed that many people didn't and when you consider how much we make as opposed to these people it's the least you can do!) We didn't participate in too many of the activities, but there was a good variety, from cooking lessons at the Real beach club (just 30 seconds down with a swing bar!), handmade bracelets, salsa, yoga, pool aerobics and more. The staff seemed to really enjoy themselves and we got a kick out of them trying to teach all of the sunburned gringos how to dance! We had read many trip advisor reviews before leaving for our trip and were expecting the worst when it came to the food. Again, we were pleasantly surprised. We are both vegetarians, which usually means living off of buns and fruit at buffets, but it seems they made a real effort to accommodate every type of dietary lifestyle. Every day there was something new, and we were pleased to see that they had many traditional Mexican options to choose from. You are in Mexico, you should try the food, no?! From stuffed chiles rellenos, tortilla soup, squash burritas, to sushi and mashed potatoes, everything was fresh, presented artistically (carved fruit all over the place!) and the staff were always making sure that everything was tidy and refilled. I can't believe the attention to detail in this hotel - anything that could be cleaned or painted or pruned or freshened up was being taken care of regularly. Don't listen to the reviews - the food is really yummy and there's tons of variety. Oh, and don't forget the fresh juices and champagne in the morning! Finally, the Gran has the most ideal location in Playa (besides, perhaps, the more upscale sister resort, the Royal). Steps away from Quinta Avenida, amazing restaurants, the best people watching around, and our favorite mezcaleria, La Botica. At night it's fun to walk back along the beach from the ferry dock, you can see all the people dancing at the beach nightclubs, see the romance budding between young mexican couples, and enjoy the sight of the fishing boats bobbing on the calm water. The whole time we kept wondering \"what's wrong with people?\" Why would anyone give this paradise a bad review? Are they the King and Queen of England?

Having read some of the difficulties of past guests in getting the appropriate rooms, I approached the front desk with trepidation and dread about changing rooms. After working through 2 of the front desk personell, I got to Raul who eventually arranged for what had to be one of the most beautiful locations of all the rooms in the hotel. I had stayed in one of the \"good\" rooms before so I knew it was there! Thanks so much to Raul for making this happen. Our experience was enhanced so much by this great view of the riviera and the lovely balcony that even had a hammock! What I would really like to write about, however, is the unbelievable helpfulness, responsiveness, and sweetness of our housekeeper, Telma. It sounds odd to point out, I know... this group of hotel staff generally goes about its work quite invisibily, unless something goes wrong... Telma, however, became a beautiful part of our vacation. We actually began to look for her to say hello each time we returned to the hotel and goodbye whenever we left for one of our daily adventures. I would like for the hotel to know that their guests notice when someone on the staff is this incredibly hard-working, attentive, and just sweet. She is truly a gift to your organization.

Well, starting at around 4 in the am, the staff starts unloading crates, banging pots or pans and it makes it very difficult to sleep.

We didn't get a chance to eat at the sushi bar. Pool was nice and the staff were friendly. We went to Tulum/Xel Ha and was a nice excursion. Also did an ATV excursion with a swim in a Cenote(Sink Hole). Both were great for the kids. Here are some tips, take lots of ones with you for tips.....you'll get better service.

Our honeymoon here was both relaxing and lots of fun. The staff are excellent and the activities are very well-organised. First up, the entertainment team are estupendo! So, a big hola to Victor, Hector, Gen, Mig, Carlos and Julio. The pool volleyball games were great fun, as were the very friendly ping-pong tournaments. The shows every night are high-quality and the drinks service at the pool / on the beach is brilliant. The buffet restaurant staff are fantastic and always willing to help. I kind of agree with the comments around lack of variety for lunch and dinner (especially if you're veggie like us), but still high quality and not once did we have a bad meal. The fresh fruit in particular is excellent. We tried the other restaurants (Mexican Maria's and Italian Pescatore), but didn't really like them compared to the buffet restaurant. When we arrived, I spoke a bit of Spanish. I wanted to make the effort, so always spoke to staff in their native tongue. The guys at the hotel were always keen to speak in Espanol and kindly corrected my mistakes in a helpful manner. By the time we left, I was speaking the lingo all day, every day (albeit with a few gaps)! I learned so much at the hotel, speaking to all the people there. There were also Spanish lessons every morning by the pool with the sports and entertainment guys...very helpful. Gracias, chicos - vamanos indeed! As for the comments regarding guest services, we were not approached once. We had a few bits of paper through the door offering an upgrade to The Royal, but nothing more. We also enjoyed a double massage in the spa, which was fantastic (and reasonably priced compared to the UK). We also enjoyed the (now famous) towel creations in the room - a swan and a heart. A very nice gesture. We went on two trips with GoNative, which we organised at the BestDay/Expedia stand in the hotel foyer. Both of our tour guides (Enrique and Rafael) were experts in their field and extremely knowledgeable. We would definitely recommend a day trip to Coba - absoultely amazing! A huge temple, cave cenote, Maya village and jungle tour. All for $99 with lunch and travel included. As for the sandbags on the beach - we didn't really care about those. As a fellow reviewer pointed out, one can simply walk over them!.There is also the option to walk to another part of the beach, which extends for quite a few miles away from the hotel. Avienda 5 is a great place to spend a Saturday morning. There are some really interesting shops, but be prepared to haggle with the market trader guys. You can get a good deal if you keep pushing (which I regretted not doing more)! By the end, we didn't want to leave.

I would advise anyone...do not go by the negative reviews. This hotel is the perfect place to stay in Playa Del Carmen. I would recommend the ocean view upgrade. Amazing view of the beach.

In fact, we're trying to figure out when we can go back this year. we're in our early and mid thirties. The hotel is GORGEOUS and the pics do not do it justice. it has beautiful Spanish/Mediterannian decor, its right on the beach, right near 5th ave, always clean clean clean. there were literally people cleaning this place constantly. Our maid Eugenia was amazing, she gave us beautiful towel art every day on our bed, with the wash cloths and even the toilet paper. on our first night, the manager sent up a small anniversary cake and a bottle of yummy champagne and two glasses. everything was so good. what's even better is that i didnt even think they would remember it was our anniversary since i mentioned it in an email over a month before we even arrived! how special is that. the food was excellent, especially the papaya. we didnt get sick AT ALL and we drank the water they served, the fruit, salad, etc. it is true that the menus at the two restaurants are limited but i liked the chicken parm at the Italian place. we ate there twice and once at maria's. maria's was good but i preferred the Italian place or the buffet. the buffet had something different every night and the waiters were great. my hunsband speaks spanish, not me, but i tried and they helped me along with it, very sweet people and they all spoke english so no worries. the beach was very nice too. the sandbags were not a problem for us nor anyone else there. its only a problem if you let it be i guess. the water was a little rough at times but we enjoyed it. we're beach people. the palapas were a little hard to get if you dont get out there early but that's the same everywhere. the wait staff on the beach is great, we had one guy that was a little forgettful so we just got our own drinks if we needed to. i was a little disappointed in thier pina colada's but they seemed to taste the same even on 5th ave so i dont think its the hotel's fault. i guess i'm just not used to Mexican pina coladas. :) dont let that discourage you from ordering them! the entertainment staff was so great, they work non-stop, i wonder when they have time for themselves. oh yeah, they're hot too. :) they interact with everyone and are always giving you something to do. i thought i knew salsa and merengue but they taught me more moves! the front desk will try to get you to upgrade to the royal but just say no and they leave you alone. now, the guest services people are a real pain in the [--]. we got suckered into doing thier 90 minute skit over at the royal. but we got a free breakfast over there (very good), a free beach bag and sarong plus $50 to use within the hotel or wherever you wish. we used it for the spa which is also wonderful. you also get a gold card that allows you a generous discount in the gift shop and salon but not the spa. so if you dont mind sitting through 1 1/2 - 2 hours blah blah blah for 50 bucks, go for it. just be stern and get up and walk away if you have to. one of the guys actually compared a vacation package to health and life insurance. good one. back to the guest services....no obligation doesn't mean you wont be harassed by the people at the royal. we saw 6 different people and it felt like a business transaction. my husband is very good at saying no and he has no qualms about telling someone he's not interested....he does it for a living. the last guy we saw, my husband actually had to tell him to go [--] himself, NY American style, that's how pushy this guy was. he would not let us go and would ignore us when we said we're not interested and had to go since it was almost 2 hours long now and cutting into our plans. unbelievable. Best day travel messed up our tour to chichen itza. we saw the bus come and go and the tour lady on duty that day said there was another one behind it for us stuck in traffic. i had a confirmation paper in my hand with the correct date and time. come to find out, someone over on the other end of the phone put us down for the wrong day. i had a confirmation paper in my hand with the correct date and time, etc. so i asked them to send another car since they messed up and we had the confirmation but they refused. they pretty much told us we were screwed. so after a good half hour of having myself a pity party, we got our money back with no problem and continued our vacation. we rented a car and went to Xcaret, which i highly recommend. it was so much fun and the underground river is so cool! the animals are great and they have really great stuff there. the food is good there too but we didnt' want to pay $30 p/p at the restaurants throughout the park. so we had lunch in the cafeteria by the entrance and gift shop. way cheaper and great food. rent a car!!! its so easy to drive there. highway 307 runs from north to south and you just get off where you need to. if you want to head south follow signs for tulum, if you want to go north follow signs for cancun. it was $45 usd for the day. i will add photos soon. this is definitly a place we are going back to.", "Date": "May 27, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "3", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Basingstoke, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cMost enjoyable\u201d", "Author": "adejejon", "ReviewID": "UR16400309", "Content": "Wife and I stayed here 12-19 April.

Huge shower. Obligatory swan towel! Food - buffet restaurant more than adequate, with plenty of choice at breakfast, lunch and dinner. Staff attentive, constantly checking to ensure nothing ran out, schoolboy Spanish appreciated by waiters. Only dissappointment were the two a-la-carte restaurants, Food nicely cooked and presented, but we felt that choice was very limited and, during our week there, menu only changed once. Bars - never had to wait, waiters soon remembered what you normally ordered. Beach service very attentive and speedy, much appreciated! Pool - always space available, even with the towel brigade evident. Pool clean and well sign-posted. Life-guards on duty throughout the day. Beach - spent more time here, and again no problem in getting beds and parasols, even when we went out for the morning, returning at lunchtime. OK, so the sand bags are still there, but this did not spoil our experience at all. Again, life-guard on duty all day. Public areas - always kept clean.

Asked to stay in room for engineer. After 90 minutes, no-one had appeared, so rang again. This time someone arrived, took one look and said that it was a central computer problem. Channels back after a further 20 minutes. 2. On last day, got back to room at about 5:30pm and found it had not been made-up. Rang reception who asked us if we could go to the bar and wait whilst it was cleaned. Went back to room an hour later, and still not made-up! Back to reception who said they would get on to it.

I went with my mom and sister, and like other reviewers, I was a little skeptical about possible overbooking issues, especially since we were not arriving until around 7pm. We booked a Jr. Suite, Garden View, and sure enough when we arrived they said they didn't have that room available, but would upgrade us to an Jr. Suite, Ocean Front view for free for the night, and we could switch the next day. We moved into our first room (117), which was near the lobby on the first floor, looking out at the pool and coast. The room was beautiful (complete with hammock on the porch) but LOUD! You could hear everything at the pool and the music in the lobby at night. If possible, request a room on the 2nd or 3rd floor, a little further away from the lobby. The next day, we went to switch our rooms and they tried to sell us on keeping our current ocean front room for only $40/person/night extra, due to a \"special promotion\". We declined, and that was the end of the issue. We moved to our Garden View Suite (rm. 277) and it was the same size as the Ocean Front, but admittedly the view was anything but a garden. We literally looked out to a cement wall and an alley. No big deal though, it was quiet and we didn't spend much time in the room anyways. The sandbags are still on the beach, but it's really not a big deal to just step over them if you want to get in the water. Honestly, there weren't many people in the ocean while I was there (yellow flag conditions), probably because it's so fun at the pool! After the initial room switch, everything was great! The hotel is very nice, clean, and well-maintained. The food was pretty good, especially the breakfast omelets at Albatros (the buffet restaurant). All the other restaurants were good as well. At the two specialty restaurants (Il Pescatore and Maria's) the menu is somewhat small. Ask you waiter what he/she recommends and they'll usually steer you in the right direction. The entire staff was very friendly and accommodating...they even offered us a late checkout since our transportation to the airport wasn't picking us up until 2:30 (check-out is at noon). The Sports and Entertainment staff are by far the best part of this hotel. They are the ones who organize all the activities out by the pool everyday, and they are awesome. Mike, Carlos, Hector, Gen, Victor (chicken little) and everyone else was so friendly and really tried to get to know everyone who was staying there. By the end of your stay, you'll be getting hugs and high-fives. They're all pretty cute too, which is never a bad thing : ) So, after our stay, here are some tips: 1. Definitely go to the shows each night out by the pool. The dancers are amazing and the costumes are beautiful! 2. The shopping district (5th Ave.) is a 2 minute walk from the hotel and is a fun way to spend an afternoon away from the pool without having to go too far away. 3. I wasn't able to find information about this anywhere before I went, but there is free wireless access in the lobby of the hotel, so if you bring a laptop and need internet access it's no problem! 4.

I would like to say a BIG thank you to Carlos (front desk manager) and Barbara (general management ass.), our vacations were absolutely fantastic. The Junior Suite rooms are spacious, with a large shower and private balcony. Our roommate, Evelin, did a great job of keeping our room clean. She made swan, bunny, heart, etc.. with towels & flowers. This time our room # was 336. We also got the rooms #224, 117 and 324. The food at the buffet was really good specially the breakfast. We didn\u2019t eat to the Italian and Mexican restaurants this time but we already tried them and they are really good as well. David, Rodrigo and Dion are the best at the buffet. There are sand bags on the beach but it didn\u2019t matter to us. You can walk 2 minutes by the Royal and the beach is nice. Our waiters (Benito & Pablo) and waitress (Lucy) were very pleasant and were always there to refill your drinks. This time, we went to visit Isla Mujeres by catamaran and Chichen Itza. We swam in a cenote on the way back from Chichen Itza and it was absolutely amazing. We already went to Delphinus, Cob\u00e0 and Tulum and all of these tours are great. If you like the history and archeology, Riviera Maya is the best place to go. The entertainment team (Mike, Hector, Julio, Victor & Carlos) was amazing, they work very hard days & nights.

We just returned from a 9 day stay and experienced the problem with bumping right away. we booked and ocean front room and 2 JR suites 6 months ago. Upon arrival we were told that they did not have the ocean front room we reserved as well as a room for our daughter. We had to share a room the first night and were promised that the rooms that we reserved would be ready the next day. When the next day came we were told that the ocean front room was not available and that we would have to settle for a lesser room. I did settle for the lesser room to help prevent additional hassles and to help keep our group of 6 together. It took over 3 days for Carlos, the front desk manager, to work out some type of compensation package and even then it was not equal to what we should have seen in return. Please note that I saw and heard at least a dozen other people with similar problems during our stay and all had the same problems with Carlos and his lack of concern and committment to meeting customer needs. His excuse for the problems was time share people coming in and he stated that there was nothing he could do since \" they only take requests, not reservations\". Given his statement it appears that if you don't buy a time share from them you will be placed last on the list. Please note that I have stayed at REAL resorts regularly for over 7 years, 3 times at this hotel for example, and have never seen a front desk run as bad as this one and will not go back. Setting the front desk issues aside it was a good stay only because of the great staff in other areas of the hotel. Teresa at the pool is excellent as well as Pepe and Ivan in the buffet. There were also a number of other good people and it would take me too long to list all of their names. The bottom line is \"if' you get your room you should have a good time.

After going to look at the rooms available my husband and I decided to upgrade both rooms to ocean front. It cost an additional $500 USD, for 5 nights, but well worth it. The views are amazing. There are a few down sides, one is you have to wear this big yellow wristband the entire time you are there. If you lose it they charge you $100. to replace and without it you can not get your food and beverages. When you arrive they try and get you to go look at the TIMESHARE next door, and have breakfast. We chose not to do this but that didn't stop them from trying to get us to go. The Italian restaurant is great but the Mexican one is not. The Senor Frogs is the worst one I have ever been to.

After trying to beg, borrow and steal to get them to honor our reservation, we reluctantly got into a cab, which they paid for, and checked into the Royal Hideaway Playacar about 10 minutes away. When we saw how nice the Royal Hideaway Playacar was, our initial trepidation melted away. The Royal Hideaway Playacar was a much, much nicer property. It's a good thing we didn't have the kids with us, as it's an adults only resort. The next day when the General Manager from the Gran Porto Real called us up to let us know that they now had our room available and that we could come back to check in, we told him \"no way, dude. We're staying at the Royal Hideaway Playacar compliments of your hotel.\" So, if you want to stay at a really nice resort rather than an okay resort, book yourself a room at the Gran Porto Royal and check in at 2am. Thanks for a nice vacation Gran Porto Real. We can't really rate your hotel because we never got to stay there, even though we had a confirmation from your hotel, but the Royal Hideaway Playacar was awesome (although I could have done without seeing the old bleached blonde, cosmetic surgery hag who insisted on wearing a string thong bikini to the pool every day - shudder).", "Date": "March 16, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Kimball Michigan", "Title": "\u201cLocation wonderful, food is \"OK\"\u201d", "Author": "kjtuttle", "ReviewID": "UR14280923", "Content": "The resort was beautiful, room spacious and luxurious, beach great, pool great, service excellant, for the price, I wish the food was \"wow\" instead of just good.", "Date": "March 14, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Calgary, Canada", "Title": "\u201cGreat Times...a few inconveniences!!!\u201d", "Author": "purplecat22", "ReviewID": "UR14239557", "Content": "This was our 3rd trip to this property and so we knew what to expect from our previous trips.

Last year we experienced the all-too-common overbooking issue that they always seem to have. However, my wife went [--] on them and they caved and gave us what we booked - an oceanview junior suite that looked out over Avenida Constituyentes. If this happens to you, demand more than the lobster and champagne that they like to offer as compensation. In our opinion that is just not acceptable. Anyhow, this year we booked an oceanfront junior suite (room #364), and had no problems. It probably helped that we were in PDC the day before and went to the GPR to let them know we would be checking in and to make sure everything was cool. It was. We were pleased with the room and location, except that there is a lot of noise (even on the third floor) in the mornings from the kitchen crew preparing for breakfast. It didn't bother my wife or kids, but I am a light sleeper and did hear the noise every morning around 5:00. Next year we will probably choose a location away from the restaurant. But the room was clean and always well-stocked. This room also had a great view of the shows at night from the balcony if you don't want to go poolside. Food: Average. As I said before, we knew what to expect and there were no surprises. We never tried the dinner buffet but breakfast and lunch were okay. Selection is good and quality okay. I have nothing to compare it against but it was average I thought. The snackbar on the beach (serving burgers, hot dogs, quesadillas, guacamole, salsa, fruit) was good. As for the a la carte restaurants - Maria's (Mexican) and Il Pescatore (Italian), again the food is average. We probably enjoyed the Mexican a bit more. The menu doesn't seem to have changed in the last year. Il Pescatore fills up quickly so if you don't make it there by 6:15, you'll probably need to wait until the first wave of diners finishes (about 7:30-8:09). Maria's never seemed to have a wait. We ate two meals up on Quinta (5th Ave) and always had our desserts at Ah Cacao on the northwest corner of Quinta and Constituyentes. Excellent chocolate mousse and ice cream. For the best (in my opinion) Italian food in PDC, head to Casa Mediterranea - in a little courtyard off Quinta about 1/2 way between the GPR and the pier (look for the big OndaDelMar sign on the east side of Quinta). Entertainment: The shows are okay. Fun for the kids but don't expect broadway. Poolside activities included waterpolo and volleyball, bingo, exercise and Spanish lessons. Always something going on. For the kids there is pottery painting (extra charge) and bracelet making. My kids loved it. Service: We received good service from everyone. I know there have been complaints about service, but we had no issues with anyone - front desk, restaurants, bellhops, maid service, etc. Everyone was very nice to us. Treat them with respect and they will do the same for you. Beach: this is a big issue for this place right now, and they need to do something about it quickly. There is a wall of sandbags extending almost the entire length of the resort's beachfront. I realize this is beach erosion due to weather, but they (or tourism officials or city officials or someone) need to truck in some sand to widen and repair the beach here. This is one of the reasons we come to this resort , but if they can't do anything about their beach then we may look elsewhere. Tip: if you want a good spot at the pool or beach, get up early!!! A lot people get up very to reserve a chair. My wife generally went down around 7:30 and even then she had trouble getting the spots we wanted. We never tried any of the Spa services here, mainly because you can get a great massage for about $45 (including tip) and several locations throughout PDC. We like the one next to 100% Natural - ask for Luci. In summary, we find the GPR to be a nice place, especially if you have young kids.

Clean rooms, good food, and wonderful service. We are a family with a child (age 8), and if our child has a good time, so do we. We stayed at this hotel for Christmas, and the kids club was great. Many planned fun activities for the children, and the gal in charge of kids club (Jeni I think) and her staff was so conserned that the kids have plenty of fun things to do, well it just made it a fun trip for us all. My husband and I could enjoy the pool and restraurants, without worrying if our child was being well cared for. The staff even got meals delieved to kids club, so we truly could enjoy ourselves. So when we decide to visit Playa again in February it was a no brainer, everyone wanted to return to the Gran. This visit was quite different, whole new crew working in kids club who couldn't have cared less about my child or anyone elses. The day we checked in (Feb.being a busy time), not one child was in kids club, they were all outside with their parents. Strange....but we didn't catch on at first. It didn't take long to figure out that the gals working in kids club now not only did not plan any activities, but sat around eating most of the day, doing nothing with the only two children in there (and one was mine). My child stayed only two hours our first full day there, then wanted to stay with us so he could swim. All in all we had a wonderful time together regardless, but it would have been so much more fun if this hotel was still offering activities for families with children. It seems to me that if the children have a fun place to go, they won't be running around the hotel annoying others.

Each day that we came back to our room, we found towels formed into hearts or swans, complete with flowers to adorn these wonderful creations. The fridge in our room was stocked daily with bottled water, beer and soft drinks. The two a la carte restaurants that were open for dinner each evening provided us with lots of dinner selections, unlimited house wine, cocktails and excellent service. The buffet style restaurant that was open for breakfast, lunch and dinner was like nothing we had ever seen before. There were so many things to choose from that it was sometimes hard to decide what one should eat today. We especially liked the fact that there was a large selection of fresh veggies and fruits at each meal and that you could have a steak grilled for you while you waited at dinner or an omelette prepared to your liking while you waited at breakfast. Once again there was unlimited house wine and cocktails offered by the very attentive wait staff. The little out door restaurant on the beach offered buffet style lunch that basically went on all day. There was a good selection of burgers, nachos and finger type food. Again, we can not say enough nice things about the staff. The days we spent on the beach, there was always someone around to bring us unlimited beer, cocktails, water and soft drinks. They also made sure that all empty glasses and trash were picked up. The same service was offered pool side. The hotel offered daily activities such as water aerobics in the pool and kyacking from the beach. The nightly entertainment consisted of colourful dancers on the stage by the pool and a small band inside the hotel in the large lounge area. They even had hotel guides that would take you to Senor Frogs for an evening and make sure that you got back safe and sound. There was a day care for the kids and lots of activities lined up to keep them busy too. Unfortunately we never did get to the roof top pool with the swim up bar or to the other pool on the second level that had a sushi bar. We were very very impressed with the hotel, the amenities and mostly the staff. The staff went out of their way to make sure that you had a good time, lots to eat and lots to drink. Many of the staff members speak english and were more than happy to talk with us about their families and daily lives. This hotel is by far an excellent value for the money and caters to families with children as well as couples and singles. There is something for everyone.

It was our first visit to this Hotel but we had been at the Royal four times before. We could no longer stay at the Royal because of my teenage daughters and the Royal is now an Adult Only Hotel. We knew we would be coming down in quality and I was concerned about that. Turns out that would not be the main problem. What you should know at any of the REAL properties in Playa del Carmen is that they Over Book all the time. This happens at the Gran mostly, a little less at the Royal. The amount of clients complaining about this at the reception is unbelievable. Of course it happened to us. I decided not to let them get away with it without a fight. I made a tremendous scene in the lobby to make sure we went through all the options possible. We were offered to go to their third property the REAL wihch is off of 5th Av and not anywhere as nice as the GRAN and the ROYAL. I did not like that offer but after fighting for more than an hour I realized they had no other option. In the end we spent one night at the REAL and returned to the GRAN the next day. We negotiated compensation with the Hotel manager. OK, let me put it clearly, this OVER BOOKING stuff is awful. It makes you feel like they are taking advantage of you. If you get bumped to the ROYAL you are getting a better deal. If they send you to the REAL it is much worse. Once you get passed this hurdle I must say the GRAN was not disappointing at all. Individually all staff members are extremely nice and friendly. They do their best to please you and although their standards of efficiency are not the same, we are talking about some of the best service you can expect at PLAYA del CARMEN. We had a standard room which turned out to be just fine for us. What you get by reserving a Junior suite is a larger and fancier room and bath and a liquor dispenser with four bottles of booze. With kids we didn't need that extra. Beware of the difference between Ocean View and Ocean Front. The first can be just a glimpse of the ocean in the distance. Some guests complained about not having the view or the position they expected. The rule at the REAL resorts is basic. What you pay determines where they will ultimately place you. Check their website to see the different tariff structure. Out of the three restaurants we ultimately preferred the Buffet. We thought the restaurants served poorly tasting and not well prepared food (Ours is European standard). There was more choice at the Buffet thus a better chance to find something you like. I red some reviews complaining about the Gym. Can't figure that one out. Looked fine to us. We were there every morning at 7 AM and enjoyed the Bicycles, treadmills, ellipticals, weights. The gym is a little small and can get crowded with more than 8-10 people. The Spa has a sauna, a Hammam, and small whirlpool. those are included. You pay for treatments and Massages. On the beach and around the pool, Guests get out early to put their towels on chairs to reserve them, and they come back at 10 - 11 AM or later. This sucks but I'm afraid there is nothing that can be done about it. Happens in all resorts. Overall The GRAN was satisfying. If you are looking for more luxury go to the ROYAL. If your budget is tight try the REAL although at this level there are other options better situated in PLAYA. The GRAN and the ROYAL are perfectly situated to go walking in PLAYA or going to the Store called MEGA up Constituyentes . So you decide. You have a massive chance of facing overbooking upon arrival. You will loose one day with this crap. After that, you will most likely enjoy your stay. Only you can say if you want to deal with it.

The people working at the Gran Porto Real were very friendly and pleasant. This is an all-inclusive resort, so when you check in you get a bracelet that tells the staff you are a guest. The bracelet entitles you to things like food and drink, and lounging in the beach chairs. All inclusive is supposed to include tips too so you don't have to feel uncomfortable about not leaving one. However there were tip jars at the bars. My wife and I stayed at this resort for my sister's wedding. Some of the other people invited did not stay on property. They were asked to either leave or purchase a bracelet for $90 a day for the services. All inclusive does not mean that all spa services, or snorkeling lessons or kayaking or similar activities are included in the price. Neither are certain premium drinks. I find it understandable, but I also felt a need to stay on the property to eat and drink my money's worth. We paid $400 a room-night for our stay. The food was cafeteria grade. I did not enjoy the buffet or the fancy restaurant much. I guess I enjoy my chickens with growth hormones and steroids and all that stuff because the chicken they had was fairly scrawny. They do have hamburgers and hot dogs (\"sausages\") if you want American food. It isn't good but they do have it. We had a snafu at check-in. They did not have an ocean view room so we were upgraded (black wrist bracelets whatever that means) to an ocean front room. It was very nice to walk out on the beach from our room. However, after noon the next day we could not get into our room until we visited the front desk. We were moved to another room that was ocean view. We were there for two nights only so I thought the moving was a bit much. I was surprised that the rooms were not really very big at all. Very high ceilings, a stocked fridge and alcohol mounted on the wall if you want to stay in the room. Some rooms apparently can be adjoining.

The workers are super friendly, energetic, and I adore every one of them. I don't know why some people said that some of the workers were mean, and unfriendly, but if you treat them with respect,, the workers will simply respect you back. I give 2 thumbs up to Spike and Mike, and the rest of the pool guys for the hard work they do everyday to keep everyone happy, and making sure that everyone is having a good time. Without them, Gran Porto would be quite boring lol. The Pool is clean, really big, not huge or anything, but big enough to keep everyone happy. Really crowed during the afternoon, personally, I'm not a big fan being around large crowds, so i usually prefer to stay on the beach where its quiet and peaceful. The beach is really nice, and clean, the sand is really white and soft. I've read alot of reviews and I can't believe that some people are complaining about the sandbags, I dont really think it's a big deal or anything, just be very careful when you step on them, But when you go past the sandbags, the water is really clear, and greenish aqua color, I thought it was really nice. The rooms were really big, very clean, I found that the beds weren't very comfortable(my opinion), but i didn't care that much, lol, there weren't very many english channels on tv, but who cares, who would want to watch tv all day during vacation?? lol It would only waste your time. There is a big closet there to put all of your clothes into. The showers is huge, you can fit like 5 people in there lol or more. The ocean view walk out is the best, its more easier to go in and out of your room whenever you want. The pool bar served good drinks, my favorite drinks were miami vice and sex on the beach. The pool bar closes around 11:00 i think..not sure..but the night life in this hotel is really quiet, not much is going on. If you want to have a wild night, this hotel may not be for you. or you would have to go to 5th ave, there are many clubs there. I can't remember the name of the bars i went to.

We were presented with our apple juice with a cherry and then escorted over to a table to be told that they had over booked and there was not a room for us. They wanted to put us up in a resort on the other end of Playa, offering us a lobster diner and free taxi back and forth to the Gran. My reservations for two Jr. Suites Garden View were booked in August so I could not understand how this could have happened. I booked this resort because of the location as well as the amenities plus we were told that we would be able to use the amenities at all of the other Real Resorts in the area, not so. What they were willing to offer and what we were willing to except for the compensation went on for several hours. They work in pairs two will come up and make an offer than two more will come and work someone else in your party. You get so confussed because you are so tired from the travel you don't know what to do. I wanted to use their phone to call my travel agent with a toll free number and was told they did not have a line to the US. After two hours of arguing we were offered rooms at the Royal Resort next door which we excepted because it was still in the same location. But.... as soon as we said yes they came up with two rooms. One room was clean but had a stale order and was hot, you could tell the room had not been used. The room next door took another two hours to clean for the rest of my family. At 5:00 the next morning I knew why the room was not being used, it was directly over the delivery area, the kitchen and resturant. The noise from the trucks slamming doors, the pot and pans banging and the poeple shouting sounded like they were in the room with us. Who wants to be woke up on their vacation at 5 in the morning. The roomservice stair way was right by our room and the sound traveled right up. The next morning I tried to get another room because we were also told we would have free upgrades, not so. Upgrade $40. per person per day was what they offered. This did not just happen to our family. Just about every one we talked to they did the same thing to them. They want you to tour their other resorts and go through this 90 min. presentation. This was even done to families that arrived at 3 and 4 in the morning. One family had a 75 year old lady who had to sit on the beach till around noon before they got a room. They did send them to a motel that was infested with lizards so they came back to the resort. The resort is beautiful but I did not have a garden view unless I went out the front door and crossed the walk way. I had a view of a resort under renovation and boxes of limes. The entertainment was good, the food was good but limited if you are staying long. Eat early, the resturants serve everyone, not just guest of the resort so you may have a long wait. The rooms were nice but the deadbolt on our room took forever to open and my husband got locked in the bathroom during the Super Bowl. They had to come and remove the door knob, thank God for him there was a phone in the restroom. Just watch out for the games they play, we come from Alabama and know BS when we hear it!!! There should be a law in overbooking to this extent. They want you to stay a day at one resort then move you back then try to get you to go to another resort in Cancun. When can you rest if you are packing and unpacking. I booked through Springdale Travel in Mobile and they had a difficult time getting a call into me, no one would answer the phone. I wasted two days trying to get some satisfaction from the management, don't bother. The only way you may get something is if you agree to visit another resort. I would definitly have in writing your room number and date in writing from the resort on letterhead. They blame it on the travel agencies and want you to book directly through them. It's not hte travel agencies fault but they do need to warn you of their South of the Border Tricks!! My travel agent did say he thought that there has been a change in ownership or management of the Real Resorts. Some of the Real Resorts listed at the time I booked had changed names. The front desk and management may stink, but the entertainment staff, the bartenders, waiters and maids all work very hard to please you. We met some wonderful people at the resort and had a good time.

Lots of neat shops and though we didn't eat at any of the restaurants, some of them looked really interesting. The hotel itself is very clean, we could not have had better maid service all week in the room. I would recommend upgrading to the ocean FRONT jr. suites. You won't be sorry as these rooms are over sized with a guaranteed ocean view. We tipped the maid every day ($4.00 for 4 people.) We were on the top floor (3rd). The beach area was very nice. Yes, there are sand bags, but they are doing their best to refurbish the beach area after a couple hurricanes. The sandbags didn't bother anyone in our party. As an aside, last year we stayed at the Playacar Palace on the other end of 5th Avenue, while we really enjoyed the hotel, there was NO beach there as of a year ago. The pool was nice too, with terraces built out for children to play on or to lay on semi submerged lounge chairs. You can also lay out or read under thatched roof \"umbrellas\"on the sand. There is a smaller pool with a swim up bar on the third floor, but we did not use it.e The food was good, but I would not say great. The buffet is pretty typical with the highlights being the omelet station in the morning and the pasta station in the afternoon. The Italian Restaurant was our favorite, it was very good. I guess the only real complaint anyone had was about the service. I guess you could call it rather \"spotty\" at times. While everyone was very nice sometimes the servers were kind of hard to find. One night in the Italian Restaurant, tables on either side of us had come and gone before we even had our food. I would say this comment about the service applied everywhere from the pool to the restaurants. I actually didn't think the service was quite as bad as my Dad did but it still merits comment. The activities directors are an energetic lot offering everything from free bike tours to bingo, water and beach volley ball, yoga and water aerobics. The nightly shows that take place at night on a stage by the pool, aren't bad (especially after a couple margaritas, ha!) No, really they were pretty good! Overall, we had a great stay.

We also appreciate the location of the hotel on the beach. It is easy to walk the beach for almost two miles without distraction. Since shopping is a must when one travels it is important to note that Fifth Avenue shopping venue is a short walk from the Grand Porto Real. The desk personnel are friendly and very willing to help with any problem. We fully intend to return for many more vacations in Playa del Carmen and especially at the Grand Porto Real.", "Date": "January 16, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Virginia", "Title": "\u201cAmazing week!!\u201d", "Author": "KMac14", "ReviewID": "UR12642896", "Content": "We had a wonderful week at the Gran Porto Real in Playa del Carmen. My husband and I and our 2 children ages 8 and 11, shared an oceanfront junior suite at the east end of the hotel, away from the pool and close to the ocean. The kids slept on 2 roll-away beds and we still had tons of room. We loved the walk-in shower! We all enjoyed the food at the buffet, especially the fresh preparations. We were very happy that we could always get real food at the beachside Tradewinds restaurant and snacks in the lobby and the snack bar. The staff was extremely friendly and helpful. We never had to wait for service on the beach and the waiters in the buffet and the a la carte restaurants were extremely attentive. We went to bed early each night and were not bothered by the noise from the nightly theme parties. The ocean varied from day to day. We had a wonderful time boogie boarding for the first few days and on the calmest days swam and kayaked far out past the pier. We loved the kayaks and para-sailing, took a tour to Tulum and snorkeled at Aku Mal and spent a day riding motor scooters on Cozumel. We can't wait to go back!! The only disappointment was the fitness center. The equipment is dangerous. The hotel staff told us about \"The Gym\" around the corner from Il Piscatore restaurant and we found our workout home for the week. That gym is amazing and was well worth the $10 each per visit.

First off, my wife and I did a fair bit of research before we booked the area and hotel and a little work goes a long way. I chuckle somewhat at some of the reviews on this sight that are negative, especially those that comment on points that are easily researched before hand. Anyways, we found the hotel to be everything that we expected...in a good way. We had a spacious room overlooking the pool and ocean. It was very clean and Rebecca, our maid, took the time to leave incredible animal creations made out of towels and flowers for our son. If you need more hangers, just let the front desk know and problem solved. The beach and the pool area were great. Navigation around the pool was tight at times as guests would arrange the lounges as they saw fit, but other than that it was not a problem.The shallow entry points to the pool was great for our son and a great place for play for kids in general. There is a small kids pool attached that is a foot deep which was in constant use. The beach and the swimming area were great also. We knew it was sandbagged so that was no surprise (research!) and the quality of the sand was fine and the beach was clean. None of us found a need for aqua socks and we spent a fair amount of time in the sea swimming, kayaking and boogie boarding. The food at the buffet was more or less what we expected. We knew the rating of the Porto Real so we did not expect Gourmet World Class cuisine. We were pleased with the service in the buffet area. The waiters were friendly and Yasmin, who greeted us at the entrance, always had a smile. Regarding the issue of service (overall), I will say this to those of you who had negative comments: it pains me to hear that you had problems, however, you usually get what you deserve. I heard some of the guests barking at and treating the staff like dogs. If you do this, do not expect much respect back. The staff are trying to do their best and a smile and a little patience goes a long way. The a la carte restaurants were very good, especially the Italian one. We ate there a fair bit and enjoyed every meal. They went out of their way to help our 4 year old enjoy the experience. The Mexican restaurant was similar, but we preferred the Italian food overall. And since we are not pasta eaters, this was a positive experience for us. We were very happy that the hotel did not place a restriction on the number of times we could eat at the a la cartes. We were pleased enough with the food that we did not feel it was necessary to eat outside the hotel. Some issues did arise that we did not know about prior to our trip (lack of research?). One was the noise from the nightly band and variety show in our hotel, and the bars, north along the beach at another hotel. It was quite loud and I would prefer to choose to go to a show instead of having one come to you when you're trying to sleep after a long day of sun, surf and sand. The second issue would be to have a more informed definition of \"ocean view\". Our original room was facing the street and the hotel across the way with only a sliver of ocean to be seen. However, a friendly chat with the front desk and an upgrade to \"ocean front\" was easily achieved. Ultimately, you are going to hear the music and shows regardless of where your room is, so you might as well have a good view while you are at it! To conclude, I would recommend this resort and Playa Del Carmen without hesitation.", "Date": "January 12, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "2", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "kansas", "Title": "\u201cHave kids?\u201d", "Author": "kansasKansas", "ReviewID": "UR12510742", "Content": "The Gran Porto Real in Playa is a real treat.

We were travelling in a group of 12 ranging in age from 8-81. Our first impression was good, nice hotel, nice size, nice rooms. We all had an ocean front Jr. suit, and even with 5 of us in the room, 3 children, it was still big enough, however we could have used more storage space, a chest of drawers or something would have been great, and there was plenty of room for such a thing. Also, the bathroom was large, but we really needed some shelves or something to store our toiletries. The shower is large, but if you have any mobility issues there is quite a step up in order to enter. The resort is extremely noisy!! We all had premium rooms, which looked out over the pool ,and the ocean, and every morning for the entire 2 weeks we were woken at 5:50am by the sounds of the staff getting the buffet ready!! It sounded like they were dragging man hole covers across the tile floors, but it was actually the tables. When they were done with that you could clearly hear the sounds of cutlery, and dishes ect.... Everything is open air so the sound just carries. The same thing happened every night at around 11pm, when they moved everything again to wash the floors. On top of that at night you also had all the noise from the lobby where each night a \"band\" was brought in for entertainment. They were always good, however, the music would start at 9pm, and the volume was very loud. You couldn't sit and listen to the music comfortably, you had to shout to talk to anyone. This would go on till 9pm when that noise would be replaced by the noise of the evening show out by the pool. These shows were poor quality, in general, and again very loud. That would end at 10pm, and then the band in the lobby would start again and go till 11pm. With all the tile and concert you just could not get away from it all!! The food was very disappointing. The buffet really left a lot to be desired, and it was the only option for breakfast and at lunch there was a pool side hut also. At dinner you could go to the buffet, or 1 of 2 restaurants, one Mexican, one Italian. The Italian one is very good, and I would have gone there every night, if we had not been travelling in a group. The buffet at dinner wasn't good at all. Often over the 2 weeks members of our group had uncooked food, everything from chicken, to salmon, to squid. The food had little flavor, and was just plain bad. It rotates themes each night, but it really didn't make a difference. The pool was nice, but I felt it could have been a little more child friendly. There is a children's program, however, it is geared more for small children. My kids are 8, 10, and 12, and there was nothing they were interested in in regards to that program. The beach is held together with sand bags!!! On either side of the resort the beach is great, but not what the pictures display right at the resort. The poolside entertainment was so so. there were the usual assortment of pool related activities, but nothing great. The outdoor entertainment staff were all very nice, and enthusiastic though. This was my first experience with an all inclusive resort. I have gone on many cruises, and done many trips independently, and I have to say that I personally found the Gran Porto Real disappointing. Others in my group had been to other all inclusive before, and they were also not happy with Gran Porto. I can't tell you how many times I was in the lobby and people were complaining about their rooms. They also overbooked the hotel, and were asking people to move to other resorts in Cancun, and across the street.

Overall, I thought this was a great little four star resort, with one big problem - the food. My SO had not been on a vacation in a while and requested a really nice suite. According to the the guy at the front desk we had one of the best ones at the resort. I wish I could remember the number, but I can't. Suffice it to say it was twice the size of my NYC apartment (not that that is all that difficult) and with killer views to boot! I think this may have been the nicest room/suite I have ever stayed in. We had three enormous rooms with three different balconies to choose from. The suite was as close to the water as you could be and I found myself wanting to just lay out on my patio and not even go down to the beach. Housekeeping did a great job keeping the room spotless and I LOVED having tequila on tap in my room! Room service I will warn you is not good. I was sick during my stay there and ordered one day only to never have it show up. It appears they only pick up the phone during certain hours. The location of the hotel is at one end of playa and it appears, along with the Royal Real across the street - to be one of the only true beach resorts in playa. I loved being able to walk to fifth avenue (either via the beach or the street). I also like being right on the beach and being able to have service on the beach. The food was the low point of this resort. Now, this is my first real experience at an all-inclusive and I do think if you take all of your meals at your hotel you will miss out on that true Mexico experience, but I was very disappointed that i couldn't even get mexican food at the lunch buffet! The lunch buffet tended to cater to a more Euro crowd - with lots of pasta etc. It just wasn't the food I wanted to eat at the beach. We did not have dinner at the Italian restaurant, but we did have dinner at the Mexican restaurant and I found the food to be very average at best.

In addition, the beds and pillows are unbearably hard and uncomfortable. The other thing you need to know, is that if you have children, the kids club here is a major disappointment. The Mexican girls who staff the club are sullen and miserable, and appear to hate their job.

The kids club schedule tells it all, they have nothing other than \"video games\" until 11 am each day, and after that the list doesn't get much better.

They claim to be a 5 star, but they are not. But definitely a 4 star. I read the trip advisor comments before I left and was watching for the same things when we were there December 8 - 15, 2007. We had a great time and found the place to be wonderful. I would definitely go back. Room: very clean and well kept. Lots of room, gorgeous shower area in the bathroom. Nice large closet. My only complaint would be that there should be more drawer space or cubby-holes for putting clothes. The safe was easy to use and was a good size. The beds were very hard. Food: good variety, lots of food, greens, fruits, and desserts in the buffet restaurant. It was easy to get a seat at the Italian and Mexican restaurants available on site. I think that eating anywhere everyday for 7 days gets a bit drab. The staff: Everyone we dealt with was pleasant and helpful. Most spoke very good English which I appreciate since I don\u2019t speak Spanish. The bar service was very good. Only on a very few occasions did we have to ask for service. Tipping: the practice seems to be $1 for a round of drinks and repeat as the day goes. Or, if you are staying in that spot for a while give $5 to the bartender upfront and they will keep the drinks coming. Housekeeping $1 per person, per day. Room upgrade: We had a room booked called \u201cjunior suite ocean view\u201d. When we arrived we were asked if we wanted an upgrade to a suite facing the ocean. So we asked what we already had (\u2018ocean view\u2019) meant and were advised that we faced the street but if we stood on our balcony and looked to the side down the street we would see the ocean. We took the upgrade. It cost $20 per night ($140) for the week. It was well worth it. Our new view was right over the swimming pools overlooking the ocean. An absolute gorgeous view. So, keep in mind that ocean view means many things\u2026\u2026 Entertainment \u2013 most nights they had a small band in the lobby bar playing music until the outside (large stage) entertainment started at 9. It was very nice. Definitely not a disco or club atmosphere. The resort is only about 1 block from the shopping district (5th Avenue) which runs about 10 blocks. It was very nice to have that so convenient to the hotel. Lots of tourist shops, some very cheap, and others very high end. Clothing, jewelry, and trinkets are the most common. Plan to barter for just about everything. Grind, grind, grind. Good deals can be had. Also the hotel will ask you if you want to upgrade to their sister resort across the street the \"Royal Real\" . We did not take that option and did not take their tour. We only were in the lobby and it was certainly beautiful, much nicer than the Gran Porto.

We ( myself and adult daughter) had a great junior suite with an ocean view (RM 360) The room was large clean and the balcony overlooked the main pool as well as the Beach. We could see the evening shows from our balcony or just relax and listen to the music from the lobby bar. Sports and entertainment team (Shelley , Spike and Nick etc.) really gave it their best shot ......the decade show was fun, the others...well this ain't Vegas baby! Around the pool and at the tables by the Beach ,Sara, Jesus and Pablo made sure you never went thirsty. A true family style hotel and therefore just a little frustrating sometimes for those of us with grown children. The solution is simple.... either book next door at the Royal or buy the $20 day pass to use their restaurants and facilities. No children at the Royal. Again, this Hotel is located in an ideal spot for the complete Mexican/ Mayan Riviera adventure. THE BAD: Let's start with the food in the 2 restaurants ( non buffet) Maries: Actually not bad Mexican style food, well prepared but with wait staff and managers who either don't care or don't understand you. Let's face it this was supposed to be a 5 star experience but falls short Il Pescatore: It's hard to screw up pasta and you are safe there but my fish has passed away at least a couple of days ago. Again same problem with staff. My daughter says I'm too critical here but she quickly agreed to eat the rest of our lunches and dinners across the street or on 5th Avenue. In fact, aside from the sport, pool and entertainment staff, the rest of the staff really just ignore you. It's like they are doing you a favour to converse with you. THE BUFFET: I have no idea how anyone could mess up a Buffet but they did. The food was just cafeteria style and quality. The fruit was unripe in most cases, the choices were dull and uninspired and just generally plain. Nothing will make you sick but nothing makes you want to go back. We tried all meals here at various times and along with the Dinner choices available were the main reason we upgraded for day passes at the Royal. We actually wondered if the Management had actually planned this as the traffic next door at their restaurants included a lot of people from ours. In all, if you can live with uninspired middle of the road food then you'll be just fine. Besides Kids only eat Hamburgers, Hot Dogs, Grill Cheese and fries! THE UGLY: What was once a beautiful Beach has been destroyed by erosion. The Pier ( never used) has destroyed the natural reef area and a breakwater wall has been built to slow the erosion. Sand bags are everywhere and entrance to the swimming area is limited to about 50 feet ( 20 metres) of safe entry. Water shoes are a must. As the beach is now gone, the local fishing fleet now starts it's \"docking\" area just at the end of the Hotel property. While this makes for a great photograph, it makes for lousy swimming. If you are a Beach and Ocean swimmer this isn't the place for you. However, the same company ( Real ) owns the property on the other side of the pier where the Beach is in great shape. Only problem is you can't use the beach chairs unless you do the day pass thing again! ( Again no Kids) CONCLUSION: The Gran Porto Real is a 3.5/ 4 star property geared to non Beach people. If you can live with that and lower food quality then you are guaranteed a safe, clean holiday destination.

It was an amazing surprise! I then learned that Gran Porto had recently purchased San Pedro which is the adjacent property and had started the construction to join the 2 properties into 1 larger Resort.And so my adventures in Playa began and each visit brought more physical changes during the expansion. One thing did not change-the warmth of the staff and the quality of the service. The whole atmosphere created in me the desire to keep returning. I observed the staff and could clearly see the opportunities for these hard working,friendly people were given when they proved to be worthy of advancement. A few years ago Real Resorts purchased the property across the street and this became another elegant resort,The Royal,which is also a beachfront property and now an Adults Only Resort,offering their guests the same warmth and efficiency in an elaborate,Spanish style atmosphere. The cleanliness is amazing,always making sure everything is perfect.The food is truly top quality in taste,variety and presentation. Having been a guest this long has also allowed me to develop friendships with many of the staff,too numerous to put in this review.Teresa who works at Gaviota's Pool Bar became a friend on my first visit and continues to be today.Others such as Benito,Illiana and Evillia are among original friends. Edwin,who had worked as Food and Beverage Manager for a long time continues his career in a position now at The Royal,in charge of their top quality Entertainment.He is the same warm ,friendly person,working with staff and guests in a very professional manner.

It was a group of 10 of us (being our honeymoon). We had a bit of a rocky start thru the airlines (but not the travel agent nor resort's fault). I was a little concerned after reading the other reviews, but in reflection my best advice is to understand what you are going to and enjoy it as a vacation - chill out! I thought all the pics were accurate so I had an idea of what things would look like. Overall, the resort was wonderful - the staff is extremely friendly and warm. It was hard getting used to people looking you in the eye and saying good morning (doesn't happy so much in NY). They are willing to wait on you hand n foot - it brought a great sense of relaxation to all of us during our week's stay. I would say that I was still annoyed by the room swapping they try to pull. Make sure if you've booked your room far enough in advance, they should find you a room - don't take the upgrade trick unless you really like the oceanfront vs oceanview. Don't get me wrong - oceanfront rooms are great (one couple we went with stayed there). Our oceanview rooms were around room 145-150 # - with a decent view. I think we had so much fun b/c we were together as a group, laughed a lot, and enjoy what a vacation is truly supposed to be. ROOMS - nice but the beds are definitely hard - ask for extra pillows to fluff with. As a nonsmoker, I wish there were non-smoking rooms - yuk! We looked at it like, \"you only change clothes, shower, and sleep there.\" They were definitely clean everyday! Actually, a give a big kudos to the entire cleaning staff - they were always out and about. There wasn't a spot in the whole place you could say was dirty. FOOD - buffets are okay. They should have more variety b/c it all gets old by the end of the week. Many items in buffet were greasy though. You can't go wrong with ordering club sandwiches from room service!! I suggest skipping the burritos on the beach - we think they were made with hot dogs? Nice feature of buffet - make your own omelet and pasta stations. The Mexico and Italian restaurants were good too! Filet Mignon at Italian made the guys quite happy. DRINKS - awesome! If you ask for top shelf, you'll get it. We were very refreshed by the constant flow of Mango Coladas from Benito @ the swing bar! The mini bar in your room (which is included) is a nice feature to either start or end your day - good convenience...just make sure they restock your beverages in mini fridge. SaVe ThE wAtEr, DrInK ThE tEqUiLa! :) ENTERTAINMENT - inside night band/singer was okay. The day activities at the pool were always amusing. Thanks Spike n 'Chicken Little'! None of us had kids, but it appeared very kid friendly and orientated. I think we liked the entire resort b/c it seemed to cater to a mixed crowd - families, older adults, groups of 20-something, quiet folk, etc. The pool bar closed at 11pm and the inside bar closed at midnight. SHOPPING - Fun on 5th ave. Make sure you know how to deal with aggressive people. They were friendly and joking. You can definitely barter with the US $. SPA - heard from friends that it was spectacular...bit pricy but worth it! Sorry, on vacation - never used the gym. BEACH - Yes, there are sandbags...but if they weren't there, there would be no beach to enjoy. We found the best location to access best parts was near the swing bar - you could get to the open beach or walk across pier to Royal beach (which is nicer). You have to understand there is commercial fishing nearby - looked like a lot of people were going out and coming back with some good catches. It was neat to watch them pull up and clean fish right on shore. EXCURSIONS - Thanks to Juan/Olympus the entire group enjoyed a variety of events off the resort...ATV, Tolum, and Xel-Ha. If you go to Xel-Ha, be sure to spend the entire day - it goes by way to quickly (bring a water camera). POOL - at first I thought they'd be crowded but weren't (maybe due to time of year we went). The back pool was definitely the main one - it should have the swim up bar but thanks to Sara, we never had to worry about an empty cup! The pool upstairs was supposedly the \"quiet\" one which we got kicked out of by some *bleeping* guests - it wasn't that good anyway b/c it was shaded before noon. The jacuzzi on rooftop was fun - love the hammock swings located in random places. You can take a nap pretty much anywhere! There is a game/VIP lounge that some of the group used one night - Really, there's always something to see or do...you won't be bored. Advice - don't be afraid to ask - they seem to be able to do whatever they can/willing to. For instance, there was some construction in an adjacent room - asked for quiet and received. Overall, what can I say besides \"you never go hungry, never thirsty, may become a ping pong champion, have a million pictures to remember and will walk away 5lbs heavier but refreshed n revived (if you enjoy your vacation as it's meant to be). Oh, there was a wedding going on too - from what I saw, it looked amazing - and we enjoyed the reception part from our balcony! We definitely plan to go back!!

We had a group of 28 go down, and I can just not say enough good things about this resort. We were the wedding couple, so when we checked in, they had upgraded us to a suite which was huge and so nice. Check in was a breeze and only took a few minutes. We had our choice of eating at the buffet restaurant or the Mexian or Italian themed al la carte restaurants. We ate at all three and they were so delicious! Didn't even have to book in advance. The two pools are great and so was the service. The ladies serving us around the pool were so good, and would come by often and we didn't even have to get out. We had to be there four days before our wedding, so we met with Pady the wedding coordinator and Ivan the reception coordinator and they were so helpful and had everything ready for us before we even got there. So we hardly spent anytime with worrying about the wedding and we could just relax and enjoy our vacation before the big day. Playa offers so many things to do, and the Real is located in the perfect area just a few blocks from all the shopping 5th Ave has to offer. Wedding Day: We had our choice of having the wedding right on the beach, or under the atrium that over looks the beach, and luckily we picked the atrium, because it was very hot and it still a great view of the beach and ocean. Then, that night the reception was at 5:00 right on the beach, just as the sun was going down. As soon as I walked out to see it for the first time I was amazed! They had just everything perfect! The head table for the Bride and Groom, and three other tables for the guests. All with lights underneath them that looked so nice once it got dark. And there was a nice size dance floor in the middle of the tables. Just off to one side, we had our own private bar, and a djay on the other and there was tiki torches set up all around us. All the servers were just amazing with just everything! You could tell they really took pride in their jobs and I really appreciate them for it. Overall, I would have to say that this was the best possible wedding and vacation we could have had and I look forward to going back very soon.", "Date": "December 3, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "La Crosse, Wisconsin", "Title": "\u201cEverything we expected...and more!\u201d", "Author": "Karen_WI", "ReviewID": "UR11012558", "Content": "If I had to choose one word to describe this place, it would be \"wow\". My husband and I stayed at this resort this past September. I had read numerous reviews, and asked many questions to fellow tripadvisor friends prior to leaving. (by the way, thanks to all who helped me in my decision...it was spot on!) We had previously stayed at the Gran Caribe Real in Cancun, so we were considered what they called \"repeat guests\" Upon check in, we were given black bracelets, which signifies this. Under NO circumstances did this give us any special treatment when it came to the staff. Everyone here is treated equally, from what I could see. We e-mailed the hotel ahead of time, informing them we would be celebrating our 15 year anniversary with this vacation. To our surprise, they upgraded us from an ocean view room to an ocean front room. Nice touch on the hotel's part. We also had a swan and flower arrangement made up on our bed, welcoming us. Another nice touch. The room was beautiful, with pillars, lovely tile work; all the little extra things to make it pleasing to the eye. Along with the standard mini fridge as in all rooms, it also included a four bottle liquor dispensor (made the husband happy!) as well as robes and slippers. Again, very nice touch. The bathroom was big, with a large walk in shower that had great HOT water pressure. No issues on this our entire stay. The first night, after getting out of the shower, I heard my husband speaking with someone (??) To our surprise, the staff had sent up an anniversary cake, along with a bottle of champagne and glasses. SUPER nice touch. They included a little note along with it, giving us best wishes for our anniversary. That really meant a lot to us, as it was not expected. I even had my picture taken on our balcony, wearing one of their bathrobes, and holding a glass of champagne. Something I'll always remember. Okay....on to the critical stuff. Food was delicious, hot food was HOT (not luke warm) cold food was cold, drinks were made the way we requested them (Bacardi and coke, not a rum and coke) The entire waitstaff went out of their way to help...nothing was too much for them to help you with. We tried both the Italian and Mexican restaurants, and liked each for it's own uniqueness. We would have been perfectly happy eating the buffet every day, though, because of the wide variety. There's a coffee machine in the lobby which is great! A good cup of Joe whenever you wanted one. Tea as well was offered. All the bartenders were very pleasant, and more than willing to have a conversation if time allowed. The one thing we definitely noticed was the people working there have been there for a number of years, and they all would say how they love their jobs. A big kudos to the Real company for making sure their staff is taken care of. How many of us can truly say we love our jobs? The activities pool was at a good temperature, and got rather busy during the peak hours. That's to be expected. The upstairs quiet pool was one of our favorite places to hang out in the late afternoons. The bartender (Pelipe?) was fantastic, and it was indeed quiet up there most of the time. Beach was great for walking in either direction. The proximity of this resort is perfect for those looking to have access to the town. A mere 2 block walk, and you're in the thick of it. After our first night there, we were given the option to \"upgrade\" to the ROYAL, located across the street for only $50 more per day. We went over to take a look at the grounds, and a room, and decided to stay right where we were. The only difference in the room was the royal had a jacuzzi. The additional restaurants would be nice for someone if they were staying for an extended amount of time, but we were just too happy with what we had to give it up. (sounds crazy, don't it?) On our last day, we were slipped under our door a comment card. We filled it out, listing names of staff that deserved extra mentioning. When we came to the part that said \"things we (the resort) could improve on\", we were dumbfounded! We couldn't think of one single thing we would have changed to make our stay any better. Would we return to this resort? In a heartbeat!! Awesome job, Gran Porto Real!

Being a 5 minute walk from 5th Avenue is well worth it! The hotel was just what we expected - affordable luxury in Mexico! We were lucky enough to recieve our Junior Suite Ocean Front room at the time we checked in (though I did see people getting the \"we don't have your room ready\" runaround later in the week - my advice? take an EARLY flight and check in around 3:00). It was truly ocean front and there's nothing better than sleeping with your balcony door open a crack and waking up to sunshine and waves tumbling onto the beach. We were quite happy to see the alcohol dispenser and daily stocked mini-bar! The room was nicely sized, the bed was a bit hard but we got used to it. The food was average in the buffet, above average in the other restaurants. The pool was great! The bartenders at the beach took VERY good care of us each day! We were not phazed by the fishing boats tied up - if you have a problem with looking at fishing boats anchored at the beach, then get out of Playa for your resort. I thought the sandbags were not an eyesore like other reviews say - it's either sandbags or no beach - and we could see daily how the beach down the way was eroding quickly. We avoided the lure to the Royal - they seemed offended that we didn't go over to do the tour but we were happy with where we were and figured there was a reason we chose the GPR. They really harp on the fact that the Royal is no-kids - but seeing kids around did not bother us at all. The nightly entertainment is, well, cheesy, but you do have 5th Avenue right up the way. Walk up the beach on Saturday night and see the fire show at the Blue Parrot at 11pm - it's totally worth it. All in all - we would definitely recommend this place to friends and family. Get the Ocean Front room though - it's worth the extra money! One last thing - the folks at Best Day Travel were great - they handled our transfer to/from Cancun via 10-passenger vans and it was an easy trip.

Interesting we thought, personal service ? \"we have a problem Mr & Mrs NewleyWebbs\" \"A problem with our computer system\". \"we do not have a room for you tonight\". I guess they have rehersed this a few times and want you away from the desk for fear a we would make a scene.(as others did the whole week we were there). So they gave us two options 1 nt at their sister property the Real Playa del Carmen, which he did not reccommend, Or the Beach property. \"the Reef\". We took the beach property. We were actually Ok with the whole thing as the opportunity to explore another resort was appealing...but the Reef was appauling. Read the reviews and don't let them send you there as it's far less than the GPR. Request to be sent to their 5 star property across the street. The ROYAL. It turns out there some 20 other guests from the GPR at the Reef. (wristbands) The next day the GPR picked us up right on time, brought us back and upgraded us to a Junior suite, Oceanview. Remember Ocean view is not Ocean front. Our room was 334 and faced the ROYAL but had a nice view of the water. The rooms are huge, Big bathrooms, TV internet, Alchohol dispenser, King bed (hard) , nicely appointed but limited storage for clothing. The hotel food was above average, the Buffet changed daily with many options, The Italian rest was superb with great service and presentation. Get the Lobster !. We only went to the mexican rest once and although happy with the meal were not thrilled enough to go back. There are many good restaraunts on 5th ave so you don't have to feel trapped at the resort. If you want a drink afterhours you can go to the VIP lounge by the front desk. Sushi available too daily at the quiet pool. (ok) The Beach in front of the resort is great but isn't the best for swimming. (liked the beach snack hut) We went to the otherside of the pier, past the ROYAL.

Everyone wants to take you for breakfast. We went to the one at the Royal to check it out. Breakfast was good, the resort beautiful and the presentation interesting. We already own a timeshare and can tell you theirs is not a bad deal. Thanks but no thanks. We got 500 peso's, a beach bag, wrap thing and a bottle of Taquilla. Perfect. It was 10am and time to hit the beach ! Go to Xcaret. Swim with the dolphins, Swim in the underground rivers and take in the evening show. Xelha has great snokeling, Tulum has the ruins and great beach. We took taxi's to and from PDC for $500peso each way. Good service, enlish speaking air conditioned both ways.

Our room was clean and had a nice view of the Carribbean; however, we were located directly over the pool / stage and had a hard time enjoying our room in the evening due to the noise coming from the nightly show. Make sure you request a room away from the stage. It was also a bit disruptive during the day to take a nap while the pool activities / DJ were in full force. The food was also disappointing. The breakfast buffet was the best meal of the day. Burgers and nachos on the beach were average and the dinner was below average. Our meal at Il Pescatore (the Italian Restaurant) was so bad ,we could not eat it. We overheard other guests saying the same thing. I believe the all-inclusive price is too high for the quality of the food that is served. My husband and I chose to walk to Fifth Avenue for several meals, once we discovered that the quality of food was better there. Overall, I would rate the hotel as average.

We were told at 1:30 our room would be ready in 1 hour. At 2:30 they said to come back in 30 minutes. We went back in 45 minutes and they said to give them 30 more minutes. By this time our travel agent, who was with the group, was involved. She came to us and gave us our keys and said it was all taken care of. ( I found out later that a fellow traveler did not get her room until 4:30) The next day at 5 they threw us out of our room. They said our room was a one night upgrade and that had all been explained. (But apparently not to us) They came and got our baggage and when we arrived at our new room it was still being made up. What could we do? The bellman German was very nice and said he woud speak to the manager, who sent down a bottle of champagne later. This room ended up being in a spot that was quieter than the first room was in. So, overall my personal rating and advice is: 1)The hotel is not very good at handling problems as they arise. Also, ask for a room not on the pool or ocean side, it is very noisy. Unless you are a total party animal. I rate the front desk staff as marginal to moderate. 2)The rooms are nice and clean and have DVD players, satellite TV, & alarm clocks. They come stocked with a refrigerator of beer & water and some other stuff. They also have a liquor cabinet mounted on the wall with bottles full of scotch, vodka, rum and tequila. If you can drink it, the booze is there. We don't drink THAT much. Housekeeping staff does a pretty good job of keeping the rooms tidy. 3)The bars make pretty good drinks. Try and mango or watermelon margarita. They also make a very good pina colada. When you are pool side the staff are very good and providing rapid service with drink delivery. All of the bar staff I met were very nice. 4)Out on the beach during the day there is a grill with burgers, hot dogs, etc. It is convenient and pretty good. 5)The restaurants, (a) the buffet (b) the mexican restaurant and (c) the italian restaurant are all pretty good. Some of my fellow business associates did not like the food but my wife and I thought it was just fine. The staff was all pretty friendly. 6) I would rate the facility at about 2.65 out of 5 stars.

I just had to test that ol' front desk so when I checked in I must admit I gave them a little bit of attitude. This time they seemed to handle it much better and got the supervisor right away. I questioned them on the wrist bands (Don't you have VIP service?) and room location per my request and their credit card policy. They kept smiling ....kudos to the front desk! Checked several times during the stay and they seemed to have good numbers of clerks to handle the checkin/out. When I checked in and the line went from 1 waiting to 4-6, they came out of the back office right away and started helping. I did hear some grumbling from guests. Mainly not getting the room they thought they should have. One couple got an upgraded room free the first night (beach front walkout) and were told if they didn't want to move to their OV room they would have to pay an additional $40 per night. They loved the room so much they paid the extra to keep it. There was plenty of \"offers\" to go to the Cancun hotel for any guest that wanted it. I think that it is really only that they want to increase occupancy up in Cancun. The service staff are paid on the occupancy of the hotel. (100USD of each weekly all-inclusive rental goes into the \"pot\" that is divided up amongst the workers) So staff try to work at the GPR and RPDC as the occupancy is high and are leaving the low occupancy Cancun hotel to work at the GPR even tho they have to take the ADO bus and commute from Cancun every day. Did not see any timeshare people but one who did say \"Good Morning\" and that was it. No phone calls, no disturbances, no strange visitors into the room for \"maintenance\". Second hand smoke was not a problem and restaurants had smoking sections. They do sell cigars in the lobby and noticed the macho late night types were enjoying their Havana knock-offs around the lobby bar and hallways. The resort is excellent for those who like to walk....we had a route through the hallways on different levels in and out of the resort and it was good exercise and always interesting. Found the ice machine too. And a back stairway to skip the normal entrance into the buffet from the lobby. Also bikes are available for the asking at the activity desk by the towel desk; they use them for tours at 10AM and 4PM when you can bike with the activity person through Playa down to Playacar and the Mayan ruins there (they go back and forth on 20th). You also see some of the houses, etc in Playacar. We preferred to wing-it and took fate in our hands without helmuts. No bike locks are provided either. Saw lots of 5 gallon water dispensers in hallways so you can fill your bottles or cups. Also bottled water is readily available. Beach-The sand area is wide (5 rows of lounge chairs) with plenty of room for both the volley ball and a soccer area. It is more crowded on the south end, away from the Royal Playa del Carmen, due to the beach buffet and tables, pool activities and the fishing boats just off the hotel property. The boats angle across the front of the hotel making the water area triangular. It is good they now have ropes and floats to keep the boats out of the swimming area. The fishermen cleaning fish is a negative if you don't want the \"whiff\" when the wind is of that direction. I got the impression the fishermen are doing it on purpose and love to break open the entrails just so the smell is worse. They throw them on the sand and the gulls do the cleanup. The beach area closest to the RPDC is shared by the folks from the Real hotel on 5th. They have an activiities booth there and a swing bar and lounge chairs. This area in past years was the designated topless area and you do continue to see more of that in this area. The swing bar has limited goodies including chips, pico, and that nasty cheese stuff they feel is good for nachos. The beach waiters use both this bar and the one by the pool to fill drink orders. Order \"dobles\" so they know you do not want flavored ice or go to the bar and watch them make them. Any tip you give to the beach waiter is shared with the bartender who makes it...however the reverse is not true. So he has an incentive at the bar to have you keep coming to him. The lounges are standard with no cushion...you sit on a nylon type web. There were no towel games and people seemed to get their chairs ...only groups of over 2 maybe couldn't get them together. Those groups seemed to pull single chairs out of the pack and make an area together on the sand in front of the lines of chairs. Also the bags of sand along the beach are great to lay on in the sun...the resort should put some portable steps or ramps on them tho to make the water more accessible on the south end. The north end (closest to the Royal) is just fine for water access. It is very shallow and waist deep out about 100 yards. Because the sand area is flat and roomy I also noticed people from the Royal coming over and grabbing chairs. At the Royal they have no area beyond their lounges and it tapers rapidly down 3-4 feet to the ocean waves. With the beach at the GPR protected by the \"whale\" concrete berm, the water is shallow and sandy and calmer ....perfect for the floating water enthusiast. There are 12 1-2 person kayaks, 3 2-person sail boats and a handful of boogie boards available. They need more boogie boards as they are perfect for the area. The waves beyond the whale are usually 1-2 foot and roll along the diagonal ropes giving a nice ride. Also bring a short string or shoelace and tether your board to the rope and you can float and relax without effort. It's very relaxing. (They should make a boogie board with a cup holder) Room-Great size for the room. Even with a king size bed there is plenty of room. There was iron, iron board, DVD player, coffee maker, hair dryer, and the mini-fridge in the room. TV got many international channels but no HDTV (Like in lobby and VIP lounge) There was no tub but a huge shower easily useful for two. (It could have had a second set of shower heads for a bit of luxury) Tele in the biffy. Clothesline. Good size closet. Switched ceiling fan and thermostat that really worked. The deck had a hammock, table and two chairs. (Air unit on the roof made vibrating noises detected during the night when all was quiet) Electronic safe now so no more keys...yippee! Bed was pretty standard for Mexico, hard but did the job. Hot shower water would vary in temperature(not pressure) when used by other rooms. Not a lot of room to room noise noticed. Shelves and closet were adequate for clothes. Cleanliness and maid service was good but they seemed to like to get in the room late in the day...I guess they combined the cleaning with the turn down service. Restaurants There are two main restaurants (Marias and il Pescatore) and then the buffet. Beach buffet and lobby and VIP lounge also have some food. Bars at the beach and pool and lobby. Liquor also available in VIP (XX on tap) and in the room (4 bottles-Bacardi, Smirnoff, Jose Cuervo, and a scotch.) Mini fridge had mixes and water. Marias was probably our favorite. It just seemed less formal and the staff were very willing to improvise with the selections. Ordering from 4-6 choices in 4 courses is a limited menu but was able to find something special. I had the salmon and it was a bit dry but very good...the appetizer was a little cheese empanada with a mole sauce on it. Wanted another one but didn't request it as the salad was coming... but it went very well with the mango margarita. Dessert was pretty much \"Ok\"....all desserts seemed to be the same...like they had been in the refrigerator a bit too long. Had the Mayan coffee ...or should say started to but just got Xtabentum on the side with my coffee. Started a trend...soon everyone around me was getting a shot or two to go with their coffee. Had the steak both times eating at il Pescatore. The first time with baked potato and a burgundy gravy, the second it came with deep fried mashed(instant) potato. The first steak was just right, tender, and as I ordered. The second was not near as good and I almost requested something else. The shrimp cocktail was good but small shrimp (6). The wine was Portuguese as were most of the wines normally served. Both restaurants were loaded with Royal guests. Got the impression from their idle conversations that they were \"slumming\" to be at the GPR. However they seemed to enjoying themselves. Dress code was not enforced at either restaurant so saw T-shirts, sandals, and shorts every day we were there. Both restaurants are open \"to the public\" and have their menu on display if folks off the street wish to pay the menu prices (195 pesos for the steak entre) The same is true of Pelicanos at the Royal. When Asiana at the Royal moves outside the Royal I assume it also will be \"open to the public\". The buffet had 5 main stations plus several cold island stations. Station one was cold (salad fixings and dressings) and #2 was hot food like pork loin slices, chicken, beef, and potatoes and vegetables. It varied day to day...sometimes the potatoes were mashed, or oven baked, or fried, or boiled. The meat usually had at least 3 choices here. Station # 3 was a \"select the ingredients and I'll grill it\" station; and sometimes it was stir fry things, other times fish, chicken, pork or beef. It was very popular and usually had a line or 4-6 people. #4 was the hand carved station (beef or turkey, pork, etc) and in the morning they did waffles, french toast or pancakes \"while you wait\". The 5th station was again hot food, veggies and meat but not the same as #2. Usually there were two soups, one at station 2 and the other at 5. The island cold areas were (1-desserts, 2-meats & cheeses, 3-salads, 4-varied) plus the bread/rolls station and a beverage area (although they usually served the beverages). It was great to be able to pick your piece of fish and have them cook it for you. The salmon was great although things like sauces were limited. I usually went with fresh lime or made one out of the salad dressings. Found olive oil, garlic, onion and a few other ingredients and went with the flow. The lobby seemed to be the center of the action. Lots of activity and a small snack area, a good bar, and several TV's, and a coffee machine where you pushed the button for your Espresso. This machine is a BIG negative as not being able to get a good espresso or cappuccino in the entire resort got to me...it drove me to Java Joes more than once. Lots of couches and chairs/tables and never saw them all full. A small stage and nightly music group of different venue each night. The mariachi group was super. Every night also the large stage at the pool put on a show from 9-10PM. (Era musical, Celebrity impersonators, Mayan dancing, etc) A couple were really quite good...and usually all the chairs were full and you had to sit on the ground or lean on a palm if you came late. They did have merchant tables for jewelry and paitings and knick-knacks a couple of nights also. The VIP lounge and the big screen TV was behind the front desk by the ballroom. It seemed to be a favorite with employees. Even saw waiters getting items from what was stocked, spiking from the liquor, and watching soccer. It had a wine cabinet so you could find your own bottle if you desired. I found it to be an air conditioned retreat and it also had HDTV channels not available in the rooms. There was a game table in there and sometimes the \"party\" noise got a bit loud. Otherwise we used it as a meeting place being convenient to the rooms, lobby, and making a break for the streets of PDC. The pool is adequate size and varied enough to use for activities. Didn't do much around the pool but heard them a lot. The pool/beach bar was a favorite, the activities people seemed to get people involved, and the kids had a great time. We did hear a complaint about the babysitting fee being high ($19 per hour) so if the kids need personal attention the free included kid's club may not be an alternative. Nightly noise from the Blue Parrot can be a distraction as it comes echoing across the water and doesn't stop til about 4AM. They must have re-aligned their speakers or got a new sound system as I don't remember it being a problem before in the ocean front rooms. The beach buffet was popular and I agree with other posts that you should eat when they first open. They need to refresh the meat/chili/and things like fries more often and in smaller quantities so they don't get cold/soggy, etc. I saw them take food from underneath the counter to refresh the food. They did not take it out of coolers or hot packs...nor did I see them bring from a kitchen to re-supply. That food sat there and got picked over for 4-5 hours. By mid-afternoon it was only chips and jalepenos for me (pretty hard to get bad ones of those) and LOTS of drinks. You will never get drunk or dehydrated if you have lots of their standard bar drinks. Thank goodness for loose liquor policies. The spa is very nice but separate facilities for men and women. Each area is the same with plunge pool, separate jacuzzi, small steam room, and 4-6 person sauna. Also the lockers, showers, that you would expect. This is all included but there is a whole list of massages, etc for upgrade. Also there is a rooftop jacuzzi and hammock/lounge area. This seemed to be a favorite with the European crowd as there is also a pool and swimup bar there in front of the standard rooms. (Note: windows under water in the pool can be viewed from hallway....be cautious with the hanky-panky or you might end up on YouTube) The Gran Porto Real continues to be a good value resort. You can stay here and get a day pass to the Royal to use all the facilities for $20 a day. Not bad if you crave to find out what you are missing and want to try their restaurants. (And no timeshare presentation included) However for the rate at the GPR it'll continue to be a great choice also due to its location.", "Date": "November 4, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "van buren, ar", "Title": "\u201cGran Porto Real--Wonderful!!\u201d", "Author": "jstee", "ReviewID": "UR10559919", "Content": "Had a wonderful time at the Gran Porto Real.

After reading about the overbooking issues, I was a bit worried. For us this was not an issue though. We were offered the \"opportunity\" to upgrade to the sister resort across the street. This hotel was fine for us however and felt no need to spend any more money or time to move our room. The room is small but very clean with a huge entertainment center (with fridge) table, two chairs and a bed and two night tables. There was only a small closet with safe in the room and a small set of shelves in the bathroom, no other cloths storage. We had a king size bed that was very (very) hard. Its an old mattress on a CONCRETE platform. There will be no bouncing on this bed! The hotel itself is very impressive on the inside but rather ordinary on the outside. We had an ocean view balcony (not private) that if you walked to the edge and leaned to the right, you would see the ocean. Not a big deal as we have seen it before and if I needed to, I could walk to the end of the block and sit on the beach. The food was not terrible for an all inclusive. The buffet is the same as anywhere else ie bland, heavy and extra greasy. The other resturaunts were a step above the normal resort places. Very good food with a very good wait staff. The room service is great too with an excellent club sandwich and again, very good staff. The pools were very nice and we very much liked the \"quiet\" pool on the third floor with swim up bar. It is also the sushi bar. The water however is super cold, beyond refreshing, just cold. Too cold to sit in at the swim up bar. There are no kids here though and none of the loud music like at the regular pools. One side of the regular pool was quiet enough though. We enjoyed all of the pools for the most part. We did not use the beach though there are sandbags around it. I guess it helps keep the sand from washing away. It is (the beach) nice to look at from the many bars. The gym is very small and the equipment is faily old though it all worked. One day the AC did not work and the gym was unusable. Some little things. We were in room 332. There was major construction going on in room 334 on the last day we were there. It consisted of a guy with a big hammer beating on the marble floor once every 4 seconds from 9 am till 5 pm. On that day I needed to request that the front desk send housekeeping up to make the bed and deliver fresh towels. This was done at 5:30. The regular working people seemed nice and hard working enough but the front desk/management people are useless. I got fewer dumb looks from the floor sweeping crew when I spoke to them than I did from the desk people. There is a small army of support people keeping the place clean and they really do a good job. Watch for very slippery tiles all over the resort. None of the tiles that I walked on had any texture to them. If they were wet, it was like walking on ice. There is also American TV there. You can relax to about ten channels of tv from home. The sales guys on 5th Ave (two blocks away) are the most aggressive people you will meet. Most will call you friend and tell you that they will rip you off less than the other guys.

They made sure that if the daily functions outside could not take place that there was plenty of other entertainment indoors that the whole family (from children to adults) could do. As far as the accommodations, the rooms exceeded every expectation. They are immaculate, beautifully decorated and anything as far as movies and Internet are easily accessible from your television. If you forget something like a toothbrush or shaver, don\u2019t worry they have it for you! The entertainment at night was great, the shows and entertainers were all truly wonderful. The restaurants had amazing food. Maria\u2019s had Great Mexican food, El Pescatore had Phenomenal Italian food and the buffet had a wide assortment of food at every meal, the only problem we had was making choices at this restaurant, or you could be like some of us and taste a little bit of everything! The bars and bartenders were awesome also, had top shelf liquor and for me Sol beer which is my favorite. The staff exceeded every expectation we had. You want for nothing, no matter your at the pool, in a restaurant or your room. They really want to make sure your stay with them is the best ever. And the views of the Caribbean Sea from your room (we had ocean front jr. suites) are the best!!! They truly look like the website and brochures you get in the mail. Also great location, close to 5th Ave and the new developing 5th Ave going north. All of this is the reason we have returned to this resort numerous times and will continue to do so in the future.

The resort is only two blocks from 5th Ave. which is perfect for nightly walks. It's a short walk to the ferry for a day trip over to Cozemel. The food was great. Our favorite was Il Pescadore (Italian). We've never had a problem with noise OR overbooking.

We had a fantastic time! Staff was always courteous and very attentive,housekeeping was great, food was excellent. Our room was on the ground floor and overlooked the ocean and was well appointed. We had an all-inclusive plan which was great. Plenty to eat and drink at any time you wanted. Even a small bar in the room and beer in the fridge! There is a laundry mat on site and you can book tours from the lobby. We booked through \"American Express\" and were happy with our tours. You cannot beat the location of this hotel - about a minute walk to 5th Ave. 15 minute walk to the ferry for Cozumel. Great shopping on the street! Be prepared to have shopkeepers call you over though. I honestly was nervous after reading reviews but have figured that people simply like to complain. Given that, here are some of my feedback regarding things that people have disliked about the hotel : The beds were not hard, actually pretty comfortable. The beach is not small but there are sand bags. Totally understandable given the hurricanes and past erosion. There is an area where access to the water is easy and clear of any seaweed.Plenty of lounge chairs at the beach. Pool is well maintained and plenty of lounge chairs there as well. We were NEVER bothered by time shares. We were nervous given all that we had read. We were offered to go next store to the Royal for breakfast or lunch and we refused. Never a word mentioned after. My two \"complaints\"....the floors are slippery when they are wet (say, in the bathroom) and the laundry detergent they use wasn't the best scented that I have ever smelled. Seriously, those are the only two things that I can say that are slighly negative. I would completely recommend this hotel. Great price, great service, great location. Don't hesitate to book your vacation here....it really is wonderful!", "Date": "October 3, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Essex", "Title": "\u201cGreat all inclusive hotel\u201d", "Author": "mmb354", "ReviewID": "UR10035404", "Content": "Stayed for two weeks from the 15th September.

Lovely clear blue sea with plenty of fish to snorkel with. The buffet restaurant always had a great choice but it was a little bit hot (could do with air conditioning unit). The Mexican restaurant was excellent with lots of entertainment by the staff and plenty of choice on the menu. The Italian was also very good but a little bit noisy at times, great choices on the menu and the staff very helpful and always smiling.

We got to the hotel about 2 hours prior to check in time, so some of our party had to wait for their rooms to be cleaned, but we all went to Albatro's and got something to eat, while the bellboys watched our luggage, and soon after, all of our rooms were ready. The rooms were BEAUTIFUL. No bathtubs as promised by our travel agent, but still beautiful. Had no problems with things being stolen as some have mentioned on this website. Just used the safe and felt very protected. First complaint is that it SERIOUSLY took the maid 2 hours to clean the room. Which was very annoying when I had to sit outside the room twice and wait for her so i could go inside and change because she couldn't understand English to let me inside long enough to change. The food at the Resort is not so great. The hambugers are AWESOME. However, if you ask the chefs very nicely, they will go out of their way to do anything for you. The last night we were there they cooked use Ribeye steaks at the buffet. And the day that we went deep sea fishing they cooked up our fish for us. (we tipped very nicely). My biggest complaint is that I am single and 24 years old and I am a nightlife kind of person. I felt that I paid enough for the all-inclusive plan (maybe I'm cheap, but I work hard for my money and I barely had enough to pay for the trip), that I wanted a bar inside the resort that stayed open past 11pm. NATTA. If you enjoy life past 11pm, this isn't the place for you. The music, the drinking, the socialization is DONE DONE DONE at 11pm. If you want to socialize past 11, you have to go out and pay to do it. And some of those bars and drinks outside of the resorts arent cheap. So I was very dissapointed. I'm not saying I want to party until like 2am and be loud about it. But 11pm is a little steep. But all in all, the resort is beautiful. The entertainment staff is a riot. So much fun, Spike and crew are GREAT and will show you a great time. I recommend this resort to families and newlyweds (middleaged, who aren't looking to party).

My wallet was lifted out of my purse within 20 minutes of arrival the only people that were where we were sitting were these people who dressed up like mayan tribal people for phot ops. They had a photographer with them. Apparently they go to all the resorts for photo ops. They bumped into me several times so I moved my wallet to the zipper pocket of my purse and zipped it. I was finally bumped so hard I asked them politely not to bump me. Then they took off their head dress giggled and moved on.I immediately noticed they took my wallet some how. With in 10 minutes I had notified management and security. I got zero help from both. However, they were never on the resort property again during our stay. Our room had a view of propane tanks. They also own an adult only resort across the street and invited us to eat break fast there. We did. Then of course it turned into a 3 hour time share deal. The pool bar was very slow. Drinks very weak. Topless adults at a family resort at the pool on several occasions. The room service was always late by at least 30 minutes. When my wallett was stolen they offered me no assistance. The manager said he wasn't responsible and I never heard from him again. I explained however he is responsible for who he allows on his resort. The BEACH WAS TERRIBLE!!!! it was really weird this is the largest resort by far in this area and all the way down the beach is beautiful, around the corner is beautiful, but the hotel beach has sand bags that are very slippery and dangerous you have to crawl or walk over to get into the water.Worry free Vacations was awesome! Marias mexican restaurant was awesome especially the captain dominquez. Other then that the food was good but the overall experience wasn't that great. There was a huge language barrier most of the time. English to Spanish. I would not recommend or return to this place again. There are too many other places one could travel! We had an OK time.

We arrived at about 1pm, and our rooms weren't clean yet because check-in is 3pm, so they gave us our wristbands so we could eat and drink, watched our bags while we stepped out to the beach for some drinks. The services was amazing. Once it was time to check in, they didn't have any rooms by our friends, so we were upgraded for one night into the Ocean View Junior Suite...it is the same as the Junior suite, but with a shot dispenser in the room along with a view of the pool and beach. Our representative in the hotel from Expedia (Roberto) was AMAZING at helping us coordinate all of our activities (Golfing, Deep Sea fishing, and ATV jungle tour). Dinner was tasty...Maria's had awesome Salmon, the italian restaurant had delicious alfredo sauce and buns with cream cheese inside! YUM! Anytime we needed something, we called and it was delivered. We needed more water in our fridge, they were there; our wakeup calls came on time, everytime; the food we had through room service wasa little cold, but still arrived in a timely fashion. One suggestions - either bring a big wad of US $1 bills or get change from change desk. If you ask wait staff to bring you change for 200 pesos ($20) - you'll get 50 pesos ($5) to tip with - it goes way too fast because you are tipping a lot of people, so spend wisely. To get to the bars and restaurant locations further down 5th ave, it may be quicker to walk the beach - then you can avoid spending money on a taxi and the calls from vedors on 5th avenue! Things to try: If you want a massage, try walking 5th ave and look for a different spa then the hotel spa. The girls got a our and a half massage plus a spa pedicure from a spa less then a block from the entrace of the hotel (walk towards 5th ave) on left hand side for $110.00 US. Deep Sea fishing out of Cancun was awesome. The girls were seasick, but still caught Baracuda, Bonita, Triggerfish and my boyfriend caught a 64\" Blacktip shark. The ATV jungle tour was fun, but very dirty and dusty - BRING SUNGLASSES! We swam in some caves and the water was nice and cool! If you go to Cozumel for snorkeling, be sure to get there early enough - supposedly morning is best to see the most fish and activity. Also, the boat between Cozumel and Playa runs once every hour, so try to plan better than we did. We ran out of time and only got one hour of snorkeling late in the afternoon. Really delicious mexican food - La Parrilla on 5th avenue. Take a card from the Lobby/Bellboy desk and get a free drink per peron with the purchase of a meal.

We also reversed this on our return. The nice part about the bus is it on the hour and arrives on the hour both directions. We made one stop along the highway and that was it.

It is hard to believe that reservations that were made in March 2007 were not honored. I would caution anyone making reservations at the Gran Porto Real to be prepared to be moved to another hotel due to overbooking. I witnessed this happening to many other families while we were there. Since we were not happy with the situation we complained and demanded better compensation. The manager than gave us arm bands that would allow us to use the facilities of the luxury hotel (The Royal) that was located right across the street.

Have not stayed in Mexico before so have nothing to compare it to. Our standard room was adequate and the mini bar stocked up daily. The staff were friendly although the buffet restaurant staff were not very good at taking drink orders. You could be half way through your meal before someone came to take your order for dinks, which was not good. The food was pretty good, great breakfasts and lunches but the evening meal options were very similar every night. However, the two other restaurants in the Hotel - a Mexican and Italian were very good and offered a change in the evening. The lobster tails at the Italian were excellent although came with a small charge which was acceptable. The poolside bar was good and they served good cocktails. The pool snack bar was also okay for a basic snack during the day and saved you having to dress to go into the restaurant. The pool itself was lovely and plenty of chairs. The pool on the upper level is also good and there is a jaccuzi up on the roof too. I was disappointed with the beach, it seemed man-made and was not what I expected. Although a lot of guests got hassled with the Royal across the road and the timeshare sales, we didnt get approached at all for our whole 2 weeks. Just be aware of this and don't go over there! Our only time spent in the Royal over the road was part of the evacuation for Hurricane Dean. This was a very stressful experience but the staff in the Royal were excellent and it was all very well managed. Be aware that there is a building being constructed behind the hotel - rooms in the 400's will be affected I imagine as ours was in 423 - it backs on to the site and it was very noisy in the mornings with workmen. There were also workmen leering over the wall down at the pool looking at the sunbathers which I was not happy about. There was security though at the hotel keeping an eye out.

The check-in was horrible. The front desk personnel is incompetent and truly transparent in their objective: to get the most $$ out of you. The fact that it's very hot while you are checking in doesn't help. The only air-conditioned areas are the guest rooms, kids club, and store. The lobby and restaurants have an open-concept...bad idea. We were then asked to go to guest services for our \"welcome kit\". When you arrive to this desk, a person greets you and asks you to set an appointment with the Royal Hotel across the street for a \"complimentary breakfast\". Nothing in this life is free, and this is no exception. My husband, son and I did not go, but my sister and her husband fell into this trap. They were held for over three hours trying to convince them of buying timeshares. The service at the hotels is awful. The waiters are careless about your needs. At the buffets, there were times when we would be eating already and the waiter hadn't even bothered to come over to take the drink order. Once the orders are taken, the drinks are flat and watered down. Again, since the restaurant is by the pool, it gets hot by 8 a.m. To top it all off there are cats. Stray cats come from off the street and wander into the restaurant area. There weren't hundreds of them, but for me, one is enough. There were two throughout the week. The waiters never attempted to take them out. Disgusting. The bar service is a little better, but because the bars are also outdoors, the drinks become hot very quickly. Of course, the all-inclusive package limits you to second-rate alcohol variety and local beer. No American beers are available here. Tecate light, Dos XX, Superior and Tecate were some of the available beers. The hotel staff was mediocre. Our room sometimes wasn't cleaned until 8 or 9 p.m. This wasn't because we were in our room or asked to not be disturbed. Also, the minibar, which is included in the all-inclusive package, is sorry to say the least. It has drinks only: two sprites, two diet cokes, two cokes, two Superior beers, and two bottles of water. We were told the minibar would be restocked every day, and this did not happen. I called three times before it was given proper attention. The pool area is very family friendly. There entertainment is among the best I have seen. The nightly shows are great and they daily activities are fun. The only credit I can give the hotel is the entertainment staff. I did not use the kids club, but I was given access to its microwave to warm up my son's food. I always saw the children properly monitored and doing activities such as dress-up, crafts, dancing, and being in the playground. Again, I didn't leave my child there, but by the looks of it, it seemed okay. The beach is obviously not what is had been before Wilma hit it, and now with Dean, I can only imagine the work that will be needed to be done. Nonetheless, while we were there, the beach was beautiful and clean. All in all, I WOULD NEVER recommend this place or stay there again.

We took our 4 kids (ages 8, 12, 18, & 22). After months of reading reviews and studying resorts, we opted to go with Gran Porto Real. Almost immediately after booking our trip, there were some very negative reviews and we were freaking out just a little. Turns out we needn't have worried. The resort and transportation were booked through Bookit.com. Bookit.com uses Best Day for the transportation to and from the airport and we used them from the hotel for booking our day at Xcaret and the Morning Glory snorkeling adventure. We have nothing but good to say about both Bookit.com and Best Day. Everything went off without a hitch and they were good about warning us away from various scams. As for Gran Porto Real, we were happily impressed. As soon as we arrived, someone brought the adults a lovely cocktail of apple liqueur, Sprite and white wine. Check-in was a cake walk with no talk of moving us to different rooms or hotels which was our biggest concern. What a relief! We had booked two ocean front Jr. Suites. They put us on the 2nd floor, side-by side and sure enough, we were right over the pool and beyond that was the ocean. Our rooms were spacious & clean & we had nice balconies. In fact, our only complaint about the rooms were the overly firm and uncomfortable mattresses. But we survived them all the same. The mini fridge was really cool as it magically refilled itself everyday. There was a nice selection of Coke, Coke \"Light\" , Sprite, orange soda, mineral water, bottled water, and some beer. Plus there was a selection of bottles of Scotch, rum, vodka and tequila in another cupboard set to dispense shots if you needed to strengthen a drink or make your own cocktail in your room. We needed extra towels and pillows in our room and all we had to do was ask. Also, there is one room service delivery with the all-inclusive every day, so that was cool for our kids. As for the food: We did just fine. We ate breakfast every morning at the Albatross (buffet). There were a million things to choose from so we're not sure how you could get \"tired\" of this for breakfast. There was a lot of fresh fruit, including guava, papaya, melon, and pineapple, tons of juices, mimosas, coffee, Mexican dishes, awesome made-to-order omelets, cold cereals, yogurts, french toast, pancakes, waffles, bacon, sausage, breads galore, eggs of all kinds...if you can't find something you like for breakfast there, you should just stay home with your soggy Wheaties, because you can't be pleased anywhere. (BTW soggy Wheaties are also available.) We had two dinners at the Italian restaurant (excellent service and truly the only Tiramisu we've ever really enjoyed) and we had two dinners at Maria's (the Mexican restaurant) where we enjoyed the flaming coffee, all the hot appetizers (especially the empanadas) and the fajitas & beef tips. One night, we went to a Moroccan restaurant off of 5th Ave. and that was great, as well. We tended to eat lunch from the beachside grill. Loved the pico de gallo & chili. Kids loved the hotdogs. It was the best for a relaxed lunch on the beach or at the pool! At the buffet, they made an effort to change the nighttime menu every night from what we could tell. Be sure to try the queso empanadas with the marinated cabbage & pico de gallo at lunch time. It was soo sooo delicious. You can get \"to-go\" plates and eat in your room, on the beach or out by the pool. We used the sea kayaks the first few days, but then, there was Tropical Storm Erin causing bigger waves, so they closed that down. But it was cool while it lasted. A lot of people have complained here about the beach and the freaking sand bags. Get over it already! They had a huge hurricane here a few years ago and they're trying to avoid more beach erosion. They kept the sand nice, clear of trash and there is plenty of nice beach across the street a little north of the hotel. Another great thing to try: the cabana where they give massages on the beach. The adults in our party had full body massages our first morning there and they were amazing. We also enjoyed a few 1/2 hour massages on the beach for $40 and they were so relaxing. Those women work some magic. Also, the staff there really works hard at making sure there are plenty of activities. We did stretching (yoga, pilates basically) on the sand, water aerobics, beach volleyball, pool basketball, bingo, a bike trip to see some nearby ruins, sand castle building for the kids, etc. If you want to do more than drink and sit in your chair, there is plenty to choose from. Our younger kids enjoyed ping pong and the pool table. We all enjoyed pool side drink service. There are tons of sweet island alcoholic drinks and they will make them a little stronger if you ask. Margaritas were nicely done. The younger kids ordered smoothies galore. Bring lots of U.S. singles, they're handy for tips (not mandatory since they're supposedly included, but it's obvious they are hoped for and these people work their butts off). Also, bring plenty of clothes for your trip because the laundry service is quick and wonderful but also expensive. we recommend Xcaret for a day, but don't bother with Swimming with Dophins. It's expensive and there isn't much swimming involved.We heard the nighttime shows were great, but we were exhausted after a day there and opted to go back to the resort. The Morning Glory snorkeling adventure was fun. IF you go, bring extra cash because there's a $2 fee per person to pay for the Federal Tax once you're there, and you may want to buy some biodegradable sunscreen and an underwater camera and leave some tips. Definitely use Best Day for transportation and extra adventures. Ricardo at Best Day is very helpful and rocks. We didn't really have to worry much about time share hard sells. We made it clear at one point in the lobby upon our arrival that was something we weren't interested in and we were totally left alone with it. Also, we never got sick and believe us we gave ourselves every opportunity (6 of us eating all kinds of food and drinking all kinds of beverages, ice, water, etc.) Also, at one point, we had late night munchies and made use of the VIP room where we got little sandwiches, fresh fruit and cookies. There's also a nice area in the main lounge where you can make yourself some tea. Also, in the lounge area, you can use the internet, but the connection is kind of back and forth. Better to just unplug for awhile. Anyway, if you have a family, this is a great resort. If we had been going on a couples only trip, we probably would have opted for the Royal across the street (same company). We had fabulous weather, maybe 5-10 minutes of rain each day. Got out before the potential landfall of Hurricane Dean so that was good timing. Anyway, having read the complaints before leaving, we've decided that if you can't enjoy your time at Gran Porto Real, you really should just stay home and maybe stay at your local Motel 6 or something, because you're determined to have a bad time no matter how nice the resort or the surroundings. However, if you go with a good, positive, adventurous attitude and spring for the nicer, larger rooms, we think you'll be very pleased. The 6 of us were!

We opted for the beach. The night of our dinner when we arrived at the hotel, the restaurant manager Carlos escorted us to the beach area. Upon seeing the set-up and our private waiter Freddie, smiling and waiting to seat us, my husband and I knew it was going to be the most romantic part of our trip! As we walked our way down the candle-lit pathway to our table, it became very windy and before we knew it, rain started coming down! Needless to say, Carlos, Freddie and a couple of other workers started moving everything into the gazebo nearby. By the time my husband and I finally sat down at the newly setup area, the rain had stopped. Carlos knew I was not completely happy with the area as there was no breeze in this area and it really was not quite the same ambiance as what we had wanted. Needless to say, without hesitation they offered to move everything back to the beach area since the rain had stopped!! The romantic evening became a very funny evening as we were all laughing while carrying everything back to the original spot and trying to make it look like nothing happened. They did not want us to help but my husband insisted, and I did too, since we were all in this together. We felt that this incident had added a special touch to the evening and made it a great story to tell our grandchildren someday. We looked at the rain as \"good luck\" and because of the extra effort made by these employees we still enjoyed the experience.

We were given our VIP bracelets and told if we would like to get something to eat or have a drink, they were preparing our room especially for us. We received our room a little over an hour later and were pleasantly surprised that we had been upgraded from ocean view to ocean front free of charge and there was a chilled bottle of champagne waiting for us in the room. The room was very nicely appointed and beautiful with high vaulted ceilings and on the third (top) floor. The temperature of the room was always comfortable and our view was a nice panorama of the ocean and the playa del Carmen beachfront. The room had nice furniture with a lot of detailed woodwork and concrete statuary and pillars (frequently part of the d\u00e9cor at this hotel). The bathroom was larger than most , although with only one sink, but a huge walk-in shower. There was beautiful tiles in the bathroom and we even had a small skylight. We never had any problems with any of the facilities in the bathroom and it was always well supplied with towels and other amenities. They even provide razors, toothbrushes, etc. We also had robes and slippers. Our mini-fridge was re-stocked each day with water, beer, (Superior bottles) and soda. We enjoyed the recently added addition of a mini bar in the room that dispensed exactly one shot into your glass and the liquor included Cuevo, Smirnoff, and Bacardi, and a whiskey. It was locked when we arrived, but with one phone call it was quickly unlocked and available to us. There was also a large closet, free digital safe, and a coffee maker in the room. The TV/cable system was interactive. You could get your account balance, the daily weather report, hotel activity schedule, and contact housekeeping or maintenance through your TV as well as have internet access, or watch TV. There was also a DVD player. We greatly enjoyed our maid service. Everyday she would make an elaborate towel sculpture and include lots of flowers and flower petals. She even placed flowers in the bathroom and in the shower. We had turn down service one night with chocolates. The main pool was divided into two halves, split by the Gaviotas bar. The pool was always nice and clean except for getting a little sandy in the afternoon. It was very hot while we were there (100 degrees), so the water tended to be on the warm side most of the time, but one day it was more pleasant. We sat on the shallow shelves on the pool or on the loungers in the pool at times. There were a lot of Italian and Mexican families there when we were there particularly over the weekend, so the pool area was a lot busier on those days. Ho ever, we were able to get decent loungers in the morning. Be careful, the pool deck can be slick. We watched one guy take a pretty hard fall and almost slipped myself. There is a worker who squeegees it off during the day. The great pool service made up for the lack of a swim up bar. The workers came around frequently and were able to remember what you were drinking. We didn\u2019t frequent the roof top pool and swim up bar because they were small, but supposed you could get sushi there and the couple of times we checked it out there were always people there. The roof top Jacuzzi had a fantastic view, but was not hot. The drinks were always well-blended with none of those yucky slushee machines which we do not like for frozen drinks. You could get call liquor you just had to ask for it. Wine and champagne were also available at all the bars. Draft beer was dos equis. Modelo bottles were available at the beach bar, but no premium liquor there as it was also used by people from the two star real hotel off the beach. The Mexican restaurant had dos equis amber. We saw the Mexicans drinking Sol cans, but that is a cheap beer in Mexico. Service at the bars in the day and the evening was always good and they would refill drinks sometimes without asking. It is true, there are lots of sandbags on the beach which makes it very difficult for swimming and walking on. Later in the day, the water even seemed to get murky. There was a lot of seaweed by the fishing bots, but none really anywhere else. The beach is in much worse condition than when we had initially been there for the day 7 years ago, but is really due to the hurricane damage. I am not sure how much the hotel can control or try to fix up the beach as it is really federal property. We enjoyed swimming at the Royal side however. The water there is clear with smooth sand, and small waves. You can go out quite a bit without the water going over your head. Just take your shoes or nothing else as you cannot lay anything on or use the Royal loungers. The beach was less crowded mid afternoon, more crowed with locals on the weekend and later in the afternoon. This is not a party resort. Most activities were family friendly. While we did not partake in any, there was bike tours, kayak tours, the usual volley ball, bingo, etc. Evening entertainment was a little weak. There was music in the lobby bar every night until 11. It was ok to adequate but that\u2019s about it-the bands were different each night. They have no theater, but do have a small stage outside by the pool . They would take up the loungers in front of it and put out tables and chairs. We did not watch the shows. We usually strolled 5th avenue for a bit after dinner. There is nothing going on at the hotel after midnight, but if you want more nightlife there are plenty of clubs on 5th avenue and the hotel usually sponsored a trip to one each night. You could also make your own party in the 24 hour all inclusive room. You just had to pour your own liquor, but they had just about everything, including premium brands, beer, wine, and champagne. By the way, they also have great white chocolate treats during the day. It was great to get a snack and cool off in this lounge. They had fruit and small appetizers during the day too and in the morning you could get muffins, fruit, and yogurt. There were other snacks in the evening. We found the food to be very good overall. The breakfast buffet had a lot of variety with an excellent omelette station. I had mimosas every morning. There was always a wide selection of juices too, and for the most part cold food was cold-on ice and the warm food was warm. We had room service for breakfast one morning and it was like they had set up the buffet in our room. You could get room service once per day between 8 am and 10 pm. We got the works-the worker taking the order over the phone just kept adding to my original request. We really enjoyed eating out on our balcony and the food was fresh and delivered promptly. For lunch, you could get snacks and appetizer food as well as burgers, etc at the Parillada grill on the beach right beside the pool. You could eat at tables on the beach or up under the palapa of the pool bar gaviotas. This food was okay, some days were better than others. The chicken wings available some days were good and the guacamole and pico de gallo were great and always available. You could also eat at the buffet which was better I thought than the grille. The made to order cooking stations has pasta, fresh burgers, and great grilled chicken. There was a good selection of veggies, side items, and salad bars. The desserts were even good for Mexico, especially the double chocolate cake and don\u2019t forget to ask for ice cream which they will bring you if you ask-a different flavor each day. The wait staff for the most part were attentive in getting and re-filling your drinks and clearing your plates. What I did miss, was the ala carte lunches/sandwiches available at some of the other Real resorts we had been too. This is one thing I wish they would add again. We really liked that no reservations were needed for the two ala cartes, Mexican and Italian and there were no limits as to the number of times you could eat there. We alternated between the two each night. We never had a wait either. We always had a five course meal. The Italian was air conditioned or you could sit on the patio street side. We had the filet mignon, and the pork which were both very good, with nice size portions. The Mexican was open air, but you could sit further in or street side on the patio. There was fans and it was never overly uncomfortable. They serve great drinks from their bars and usually a welcome drink. The watermelon martinis at the Italian were excellent and the Mango margaritas at the Mexican were very smooth. We had fajitas one night and salmon and fish on the other night. Again both very good, everything served warm and with good proportions. The chicken salad at the Mexican was also excellent. My boyfriend\u2019s favorite part was the Mexican and Spanish coffees made flaming table-side after dinner. We found out the trick is they will make it after 9 when they are not as busy in the restaurants. This is a special treat-just ask for it. The service was excellent in both restaurants and we have no complaints. Everything was prompt, drinks were always refilled, everyone was friendly and eager to serve., saying it is our pleasure to serve you. One night the head waiter at the Italian personally came over to our table asking how we found everything and that they would be waiting for us tomorrow. We frequently tipped bartended, drink servers and in the restaurants. We did not feel like we had to, but felt the service was very deserving. We were very pleased with the quality of service from all staff and everyone of them was friendly from the front desk to the maids and maintenance workers. We frequently travel to all-inclusive in Mexico and the Caribbean and felt this resort definitely is deserving of at least 4 \u00bd stars. My boyfriend said it was his favorite trip of this year (it was our 4th trip AI this year). We definitely think this is the nicest Real Resort we have stayed at and would definitely recommend it.", "Date": "July 14, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Check in / front desk": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Location": "4", "Value": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Oklahoma, USA", "Title": "\u201cBooked this hotel, but ran away FAST!!\u201d", "Author": "SoonerGal", "ReviewID": "UR8108497", "Content": "My husband and I arrived at GPR on the morning of July 6.

We were immediately persuaded to go look at the rooms at the Royal (even though we were promised that a room at GPR would be available for us later in the day). We were told that for an extra $30 a night we could upgrade to the Royal across the street. So, six of us who had been on the shuttle together walked over and looked around the Royal and then came back and checked out the Gran Porto. It only took my husband and I about 2 minutes of looking at GPR to realize that upgrading to the Royal would be the best $150 we had EVER spent!! The reviews of the GPR are right on.....the beach is AWFUL, the pool was elbow to elbow with kids, and the buffet (which we tried one day for the heck of it) was simply edible, but miserably hot in there. So....to make a long review short, we didn't get to exactly experience the whole aspect of the GPR (thank goodness), and I will never book there again.

We just returned from our stay at the Gran Porto Real Resort in Playa Del Carmen. The check-in process was by far the worse experience we have ever had checking into a hotel. The front desk just doesn't care, they only want to take your money! We were there for our daughter's wedding and had 68 guests arriving, luckily not all, but most of them stayed at the Gran Porto. Please note that I watched this happen to everyone who did not already upgraded to the Ocean Front Rooms (Ocean View is not the same, just means that if you hang from your balcony you might be able to see the ocean). Apparently, their goal the week we stayed was to fill all the \"upgraded\" rooms. Anyway....here is what we experienced... Get to hotel, our room is not ready, will be ready at 3:00pm, but we get our bracelets so we can sit at the pool, eat and drink (hoping that you drink and just say yes to the upgrade). Anyway, at 3:00 we are told they do not have the room we paid for, but if we want to upgrade to an Ocean Front room we can have a room immediately for $40 (they come down to $30). Oh, in some cases they offer 1 free upgrade night...amazing that this is the same story time after time....if you don't take the upgrade, your room is the equivalent of a 1 or 2 star hotel...icky...icky...limited air conditioning, dirty, smelly and bad toilets! Please remember this is not only my story, but everyone of our guests (approximately 50 stayed at the Gran Porto)and they arrived at different times during the wedding week...same story and the Front Desk just doesn't care! Almost forgot one very important item...the price to stay at the Gran Porto was $50 less on the internet that week then what we were forced to pay for a sleepable room, we could have stayed at the Royal, based on the internet price for less! Some of our guests did decide after seeing the rooms to upgrade to the Royal since for them, even the upgrade at the Gran Porto was not an upgrade and the common areas including the buffet and eating areas are not air conditioned ...very hot in June/July. The Bride and Groom Story..No deals for them, even if they had 50 guests staying at the hotel during the low season. In fact, when they said no to the original upgrade price, then changed their minds after seeing the non-upgraded room, the upgrade price went up by $20/night so from $30/night to $50! Needless to say there was a lot of loud conversation about the $20 increase. And we had 50 guests coming...imagine our tension knowing our guests would be treated so poorly...the Gran Porto just doesn't care. Also, the beach is held together with sand bags, so you can not walk along the beach in front of the hotel. The beach at the Royal is very nice. Please don't stay at this resort. We had a wonderful first night at the J.W. Marriott in Cancun and the couple sitting next to me on the plane ride home said the RIU gave them a complementary upgrade because the resort was not full. Some of our guests stayed at the Blue Parrot and did not have any hassles, so there are places to stay that understand Customer Service. Concluding...we did not let the Gran Porto ruin our time wonderful time with family and friends, but they could have made the entire experience fabulous minus all the hassles...so while they won in the short term (forced us to pay more for a room), they lost in the long run...no repeat business.", "Date": "July 5, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "2", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "minneapolis", "Title": "\u201cTerrible beach\u201d", "Author": "babygrand", "ReviewID": "UR8017495", "Content": "There are sand bags everywhere on the beach - no access available to the ocean.

Let me start by saying that I go to Mexico and Playa del Carmen all the time, so I know what is out there. I chose this property this time because I was traveling with friends that wanted an all-inclusive that is still right in the city. I would say location is the only thing this property has going for it. Upon check-in I was told that all the Junior Suites were sold-out and that I was going to be upgraded to a Master Suite, but that I would have to switch rooms the next day. I explained that I did not want to switch rooms, and I wanted the room I had booked. They would not budge. I finally checked into the room out of exhaustion. When I checked in the girl at the front desk kept saying it wouldn't be a problem, it would work out, and we could keep the room. Well after a night on the town, I was woken up and told to get out of my room. They didn't care that I was fast asleep. I kept explaining that I never wanted the room in the first place. They told me they would upgrade me to an Ocean View, well when I switched rooms all on my own I realized that it was only Ocean View if you got on the deck and craned your neck. The beds were so uncomfortable, and there were ants everywhere. I was then overcharged by the in-house transportation company. When I went to try and argue it the employee called me stupid and uneduacted. After that we began receiving phone calls at all hours of the night from someone saying they were from that company. We called the front desk, and they said they were coming from somewhere in the hotel, and they couldn't do anything about it. The calls got worse and worse until they started becoming threatening and making gross sexual references. I was so scared to walk the halls by myself. I stayed at the Deseo in February, and I had such an amazing time. Every time I called the Front Desk to try and get the calls to stop they would put me on hold or act like they didn't understand my English. The food was DISGUSTING!!!! The wine and champagne was not drinkable. The service at the pool was good, but the service at the restuarants was horrible. We ended up eating out all the time because it was so gross. Three of my four companions got sick. At the Italian Restuarant one night I ordered a bottle of wine and it took 30 minutes to get it, I was eating dessert when it came. It tasted horrible, and I still had to pay for it. The hotel really ruined our vacation. I have been tryinig to call Corporate and complain, but they keep transferring me and no one picks up.

We got to our room (probably last decorated in the late 70s/early 80s), opened the doors, and had a terrific view of some guy's big belly hanging out outside our door on a hammock - beautiful! Outside the sand and pool were filthy. Small boats were docked up and down the coastline so you certainly would not want to go for a swim. We decided to have lunch near the pool and enjoyed lsitening to several wonderful classy ladies yelling and cursing at their kids. We had dinner at the Italian restuarant which was one of the worst dinners I have ever had. It is hard to go bad with Italian but they certainly did - the most bland food. Don't even bother with the wine - do not bother. Just order up one of the few beers you can get (they do not have a large range). My husband who never ever complains lost his mind during the evening. He woke with bug bites. He spent several hours complaining on the telephone and in-person and asked for a transfer to the Royal. After hearing \"No\" many times, they finally agreed to move us. Just know, if you want to move, and they tell you that you cannot, be persistent. The move is well worth it. The Royal across the street is a major improvement. As soon as we got to the Royal, everything was much better. Even the ocean seemed cleaner across the street. Resturant options were better, the pool was cleaner, and the rooms were brand new.

Supposedly treated like \"royalty\" if you are an owner. Not so true. I had read reviews about how the rooms booked were never available and they would try to send you somewhere else or the room you booked wasn't available and they would give you a different rooms.

They upgraded us to oceanfront rooms (I had 2-one for my children and one for me and my husband) Days later they shut our key off and told us we owe them for upgrade. I tried explaining we never asked for upgradeand was nver mentioned when they gave us the rooms and they just keep you in circles with never answering you. You talk to so many different people and you they never let you get any answers.

You would have to go to 5th Ave for that,which if you are doing all-inclusive kind of stinks that youhave to do that. Food was average. Lot's of choices at buffet. Only 2 restaurants to eat and they are kind of small and you wait awhile for a table. 5th Ave has some great restaurants again stinks if you are paying all-inclusive like we did to have to go out and pay for food and drinks, but after a few days you get sick of it. Can't beat location and we did end up having a great time, but wouldn't go back due to aggravation and not really being assured what you are going to get for a room. Wouldn't chance it again.

Here is how to resolve an issue like this......Call your credit card company tell them services were not rendered and advise that the Hotel was unwillingly to work it out or offer a refund. They will credit your account back, but it also triggers who ever you booked through to make contact with you...You will be very surprised how quickly you get your Ocean Front that you paid for. P.S. -The Royal is the most immaculate and cleanly All inclusive I have ever stayed at.

You have to leave the hotel and walk down the street to get to the restaurants, but thats no problem, they're right there. I have been to Mexico 6 times, this time included, and I have never gotten sick, nor has my wife. The food at the Italian Restaurant was ok, but I had a tough steak, ask for A1 sauce. My wife had pasta with alfredo sauce wich was also ok. The food at the Mexican restaurant was ok too, we had tacos and enchiadas, and the buffet was ok, except food sits out too long in my opinion. STAY AWAY from the food they are serving on the beach. They cook hamburgers and hot dogs in the kitchen, then cart them all the way to the beach where they can sit for hours over a tiny little flame. We got sick, as did other people. We later talked to a waiter about it and he came right out and said \"oh, did you eat the hamburgers?\" So, they know there is a problem and aren't doing anything about it.

They told me they'd put us up at The Sandos Caracol Beach & Spa for 1 night and also comped us a lobster & champagne and a Xel-ha/Tulum guided day trip. So they had me sign a form stating all of that and off we went to Sandos. Needless to say, we were not happy, but once we got to the sandos it was alright. We cleaned up and went swimming, got drinks and food. The hotel was nice, a little too big for our liking but nice enough. The next morning we chose to get a taxi and get back to the gran porto at 7AM. When we first arrived, they told us we were supposed to be their for two nights and we flipped. I then just kept going up to the front desk and hounding them about a room. In the meantime we ate and got chairs out by the ocean. One thing that helped I think is I walked through the halls of the hotel and saw which rooms were being turned over, not just cleaned. Then went and told the front desk the room numbers and said we would take any of those rooms. Anyway, by 11am we had a room and our vacation started, the rooms are great, very spacious and clean. We stayed in room 246 which was toward the far end of the hotel, facing the royal. The view of the ocean was great for a \" jr. oceanview suite\".

The beach is ok, it does have sandbags and a lot of coral/rock once in the ocean, I have been to better but is ok if you get out pretty far. The beach at the royal is much better and we went over there a few times to enjoy. The spa is great, we got massages and my girlfriend got her nails done. They gym is sufficient, could use another treadmill or so but are usually free on the odd hours. The food was good, breakfast was excellent and the reservation restaurants are nice.

Check-in was a little confusing by American standards, but as my wife reminded me you're in a foreign country they do things different here. While our room was not immediately ready they did give us access to the buffet for a bite to eat while we waited. It was worth the wait!

Portions at all the included restaurants were generous and we did not go away hungry. The wait staff, cooks, housekeeping staff, and all hotel employees were friendly and quick to help or just say hola. The only individuals that seemed to have bad attitudes were a couple of guests who had no consideration for others around them. We did get a few hassles from the time-share people (this started the minute we stepped off the plane). We just ignored them, smiled and moved on.

She always had a smile on her face and we found that she was very good with our children as well (even though they weren't the ones tipping her).

The buffet always had lots of choices, seafood, chicken, beef, pork, salads, veggies, pasta, etc. The beach in front of the resort was not the best for swimming, a bit rocky. Very nice for relaxing in the sun though. When we wanted to swim, we either swam in the pool, or walked past the pier and swam in front of the royal hotel. The resort had two beach bars, one at the pool and one near the royal resort that had swings to sit on. Drinks were good. The resort is very close to fifth avenue with lots of shopping, food, and bars. A very nice walk and a great place to people watch. Lots of security in the area, we always felt safe. The only problem we had was a cellphone that was stolen off of our terrace, we had left it there briefly while we had gone back into our room to get something. This could have happened anywhere of course, and I would not let it defer me from returning to the resort. I would just keep a closer eye on my belongings.

The resort food is pretty good -- its not 5 star but its just as good as what you get at any typical american chain -- always had fresh fruit and veggies (yes the water is purified) and fish options too: breakfast is by far the best buffet; both sit downs were nice and had little if any wait.

The resort is also right in town if you like to explore, 10 minute cab from Xcaret park, 5 minute walk to the ferry to Cozumel.

The maid was very nice, the room nicely done and she even decorated my friend's room with flowers and was very attentive to our needs.

We didn,t get to see the other since we were out on the fifth avenue every night, shopping and enjoying the whole atmosphere. We didn't feel that this place was at all dangerous. There were guards and police officers everywhere and the people were just very nice. We did enjoyed the beach every day. We did get 7 days of none stop sun and heat. The waitress on the beach, was the nicest of them all. She was there every day, always smiling and very helpfull . Be carefull, the sun is extremely hot and three of us got sunburns after only a few hours....

The good news. The hotel is a a beatiful porpety with with large rooms, weel decorated, and very comfortable. As with all Mexican resoorts we have stayed at, the staff are excellent and do everything possible to accomidate you. Now the not so good news. The hotel overbooks the rooms because they count on a certain percentage of guests to take advantage of various offers to move to their other properties, the Gran Royal Real across the street as well as their two hotels in Cancun. This practise, depending on the number of people moving, results in rooms that have been booked not being available, or guests not getting the types of accommodations that they paid for. This was a constantly heard complaint amongst guests which was discussed all over the resort. The hotel is huge, about 2 city blocks long, and their definition of Ocean View Junior Suite is if you strech over your balcony and can see a postage stamp bit of blue green water, than that's an Ocean View. Of coursewhen we checked in we were told that the room that we booked was not available, and they offered to send us to Cancun, or to give us another room and move us the next day. We opted for the later. We were put into an Ocean Front ground floor Jr. Suite and decided that rather than moving around, we would just stay where we were. The next morning when I went to advise them at the front desk that we would just keep the room we were given, I we were charged an additional $345.00 U.S., to keep the room which we paid, (according to other guest we spoke to this is their standard practice, although the price varries) Your are then referred to guest services, which are really front men for time share vacation package sales at other Real Resorts. They immediately try to encourage you to attend an information session at the property across the street, by offering you free breakfast the next morning, (which we did not go to) by mid week they would stop us when we walked by their desk and offer us car rentals and trip excursions to attend the information sessions. They also try to encourage you, for a small surcharge to move to the property across the street, or to one of their 2 Cancun resorts, which we also did not do. The guest that do move free up rooms at the over booked Gran Porto Real. Each night we would get enticements to move slipped under our door. Due to the room suffle game, the housekeeping staff was unable to keep upand on Sunday our room did not get made up, but we survived. The food at the resort was not up to par with other resorts we have stayed at, at got real old real quick, it was pretty much the same every day. Breakfast was the best meal of the day, how can you screw up bacon and eggs! The ala cart restaurants were ok but after awhile listening to drunk Americans being rude to the waiters lost its charm. The real kicker was Spring Break. Not the type of Spring Break that I anticipated. I was under the impression that Spring Break involved collage and university students. There were a few university aged people staying at the resort, the ones that were there were well behalved and considerate. For some reason Ameriacan pareents now feel that their SPAWN in the 13 to year old crowd should also be included in Spring Break. These kids were brought in by chapeones, usually 1 mother to 20 kids and turned loose on the All Inclusive resort, and came in on 5 day excursions. There was a consant flow of durnk teenages, throwing up, young girls falling off their high heels, crying, screaming, and putting on BARBIE parades. The young lads thought that screaming obsenities at the lobby bar in the evenings, (which is where guest would migrate to in the evenings for a drink and a QUIET conversation!), was the grown up thing to do. To get away from this, you can take a couple of drinks back to your room, go out on the balcony and be entertained by the gowings on late at night on the beach, some of which was very explicit. Where were the mother chaperones you might ask? Alot of them were gussied up hitting on the guys that ran the daily activies programs at the hotel. \"What Happens in Mexico, Stays in Mexico\", right mom! If your room is on the ground floor facing the beach, and the beach entertainment is slow, you can sit on your balcony at night, have a drink, listen to the sound of the waives, and count the RATS running in the greenery infront of you room. We quickly discovered why the cats are allowed to run freely in the restaurants and other parts of the hotel. We did not feel compared to other resorts we have stayed at in Mexico that, we recieved value for our dollar.

A short walk south and 80 pesos apiece got us a great little palapa and two nice beach loungers with great beach access for the kids, but this took us away from the all inclusive amenities (free drinks) for the day. Another annoyance was that our room was not ready on the day we arrived. They put us up in a really nice ocean front room with one king sized bed for the four of us. When we called down for another bed, they brought one little cot. The floor is too hard for anyone to bed down there as it is tile.

After a long and tiring day of travel our group arrived at the Gran Porto Real Resort only to be told that, although they could confirm our reservations, there were no more rooms available at the resort. After much frustrating discussion, we finally agreed (under protest) to be transported 20 minutes up the beach to a luxury resort for an interim stay...we were promised that it would not be Cancun as we had already visited this place and wanted to be in the Playa del Carmen area. 45 minutes later we were back at a resort in the Cancun airport area. This proved to be only the first of many lies. The day that the Gran promised to pick us up for our return to the Gran Porto, they were two hours late in arriving. Once we finally arrived, despite guarantees that our upgraded rooms would be ready, they continued to stall and to make false promises throughout the afternoon. 6 hours later we were finally given rooms, only to discover that not only were they not the upgraded suites promised, but they weren't even the suites we had originally booked. There was no \"Ocean View\" to be seen anywhere...we were given standard rooms across from a construction site.

On a daily basis, other vacationers could be seen having the same discussions with the front desk, and they too were treated with the same careless disregard. The management of bookings, the behavior and attitude of the front desk staff, and the accommodations we received were far from the five star standards that we had paid for.

We even walked down to the ferry and rode across to Cozumel for the day. Great location, you dont need a cab to go anywhere, everything is within walking distance and we generally felt safe everywhere we went. Now for the bad; this resort as far as entertainment goes will bore you to tears. The main excitement around the pool during the daytime is bingo, and the music they play poolside over the speakers will put you to sleep. It seemed almost like they didnt want anyone to have fun in fear people would drink more or something. My wife and i are not 'party animals' by far, but we do like to be entertained to some extent with at least some nice carribean style music around the pool. By early afternoon even the horrible music is shut off and an errie silence creeps in, truly truly boring.

However, luckily I read another Trip Advisor beforehand, so we knew to walk around the the pier towards the Royal Real Hotel (sister hotel) and the beach is simply lovely over there. Only problem is that you cannot use their lawnchairs of course. Also, for some reason this hotel overbooks CONSTANTLY. We stayed in a standard room the first night, even though we had paid for a junior suite. They gave us a free 25 minute massage to make up for it. No big deal as the standard room was small but nice. It took forever to get it straightened out the next day. We had to come back 4 times as they kept telling us, \"Come back in an hour and your room will be ready.\" Nobody enjoys wasting a full day on that. We were far from the only ones. Everyone around us had the same problem. We talked to another couple that had tried unsuccessfully for 3 days to get the room they were paying for and just finally gave up. No way to run a business. It rained a lot (we were there Feb. 8-13) and the sewers backed up, running into the ocean, causing a horrible odor throughout the resort and the streets. Lovely. The food was not good. It was edible, but nothing was great. The deserts were awful. Little Debbie snacks presented on a lovely plate in gourmet fashion. We found the service in the restaurants to be excellent, just not the food. I would never consider booking at this hotel again. I would either stay at the sister (more expensive) hotel across the street (Royal Real) where the beach is beautiful or staying somewhere else. While walking on the good beach, we discovered these adorable little individual huts about 100 feet from the water called the Shangri La Caribe. The prices were much cheaper than what we paid for our hotel room and they were simply adorable and so incredibly close to both downtown and the good beach. Might be worth checking out. Anyway, no more Playa del Carmen for us. Very dirty and I have become sick both times we have been there.

There is always a lineup of people at the front desk yelling at the front desk staff. The manager will not come out of the office to help you. Some people were walking through the front desk area and going into the backroom to try to find the manager. Never saw anything like it before. Felt very sorry for the staff. Our problem was we just booked a standard room and it was awful. It didn't even have a window. Most of the standard rooms don't have a window or if they do it is about 1 foot by 2 feet and looks out onto an old office building. We finally got moved to a room with a window but it was tiny. No chair or table. You get ot sit on your bed for 2 weeks. We have had many standard rooms in Mexico and have always been very happy so didn't expect this. We had a note put on our door that we could move into Cancun to a brand new hotel so we thought we might as well go and see if it was any better. They told us to book the day before we wanted to go and we could leave the next day. When we went to tell them we would go the next day they said the promotion was over and we couldn't go. The next day I asked another guy at the desk and he said we could so we headed into Cancu with a van full of people who where all very unhappy. The hotel we went to was The Royal in Cancun. Very very nice. Still some construction going on but that didn't bother us. Just happy for a decent room with a window. the other problem I had was the cats. I am very frightened of cats and on some night there were up to five of them running around the dining room. I usually had to take my food and leave so never got to relax and enjoy a meal.

We arrived at the airport and were mobbed by the timeshare folks. Finally waded through and waited in the rain for our van ride. All luggage was completely soaked. The one hour ride in the rain in the van with one working wiper was interesting. The \"fun\" really started when we arrived. We were there for a business conference with approximately 30 other associates and clients and not a single one of us got the room we booked. There were numerous people in the lobby who were still waiting from days before to get moved into the type of room they booked. The check in process was very slow and the staff didn't seem to care whether or not we got into the master suite we paid for. Once we finally got a room we discovered that there was one bed. We travelled with our 11 yr. old daughter who has grown a mite big to be sleeping with Mom & Dad. Hours later they changed our room to a another with two beds . Other than the front desk staff, the staff overall were very friendly especially the bar-tenders. The barstools at the bar poolside were without question, the most uncomfortable barstools any of us ever sat on in our lives. The beaches looked very clean in front of the hotel, raked every day however when you hear about the sewer problems later in this review you may want to reconsider the whole beach thing there anyway. The food was just OK, toughest steaks we've ever attempted to chew. Poolside buffet was the best option. The nicer of the two restaurants was the Italian place, but forget about getting into it between 6-9 pm without a very long wait. The meeting room was disgusting, smelling of mildew. The kicker here was that on the last day of the conference, they involutarily displaced us (because of a wedding party; due to rain) to the sister resort next door, only to be told we'd have to pay for the amenities (food, beverages) we wanted and were available at the all inclusive price at the meeting room (Porto Suite) that we got kicked out of. We ended up having the meeting poolside, having to compete with other conversations and loud music. The final straw was the open running sewer in the streets (see posted picture) running through the kids playground and then on into the ocean where we were swimming for the last week. Due to some periodic rain, especially the last night and the morning we left, the entire sewer system was backed up and exploding out the the man-holes and running six inches deep past the front of the resort. The smell was overwhelming nearly gagging everyone in our party. Needless to say, I will never be swimming in the ocean anywhere near the vicinity of the Porto Real Resort. The overall experience was dismal and the exploding sewers really settled the matter. Due to the overbooking and my concern about the sewers running into the ocean we will never go back to this hotel and this experience has probably ruined us for life on the Playa del Carmen area in general.

I am a C6 quadriplegic from a spinal cord injury and confined to a wheelchair so had some special challenges as I do on pretty much any trip. This was our sixth trip to various parts of Mexico so we have had some experience with what to expect. We flew out of Calgary so it is about five hours or more from the time you board the plane until you disembark. If you fly with Sky Service I recommend you pre-book seats with extra legroom. That may also apply to other airlines. When we arrived in Cancun we had to wait quite a while to disembark while they searched for an aisle chair even though that was supposedly arranged in advance as well by the airlines. That's Mexico! In my case, they had to carry me off the plane down steps because they don't have the ramps, but that was no problem as they have plenty of people helping. Once we got into the airport we were spotted by staff and moved into a lineup to get through customs that bypass the other long lineups. That was a nice bonus. As with all of our previous trips to Mexico, we encountered wheelchair accessibility issues with the transfer from the airport to the hotel. For this trip I was using an Esprit power chair that collapses and converts to a manual chair quite easily (although heavy for a manual chair) for traveling purposes. It has a small battery that powers motors in the hub of the wheels. My regular power chair is way too heavy to take on a trip like this and I am not aware of any adapted vehicles available there to transport that kind of chair. In order to be transported to the resort, you cannot load the traditional buses so you need to arrange special transportation in advance through your travel agent, or you can also rent a van at the airport. In my case, Signature Vacations provided the van. Most Mexican towns and businesses do not have a lot of curb cutaways, so the light weight chair gives me the flexibility to be lifted, with assistance, into awkward places. We were told in advance that the hotel was built to be wheelchair accessible. We pulled up in front of the hotel after a long day of travel and immediately noticed that it was four steps up into the hotel. There was a ramp but it required that we unload on the street, and since it was raining at the time, the people helping me had to stand in several inches of flowing rainwater. The ramp into the resort was quite steep (as were a number of the ramps in the resort), and not something a person in a wheelchair could negotiate without help. We checked into our wheelchair accessible room and immediately noticed that the room was built on two levels. The bathroom, closet and main entry area were on one level and there was about a 6 in. step down to the bedroom area. Anybody who would build a wheelchair accessible room on two levels obviously doesn\u2019t understand how wheelchairs work. There was a ramp built but it was a very short ramp and my wheelchair anti-tippers would catch on the ramp when I was trying to go up, so there was no way I was able to get back to the main level without assistance. Some wheelchairs wouldn\u2019t have the same issue but anyone in a wheelchair would need a considerable amount of strength to go up the ramp. As well, the bathroom had no grab bars and it was difficult to access the toilet. We went back to the front desk and were told that there were only four wheelchair accessible rooms in the hotel and they were all the same. We pushed for a resolution and were able to speak to the manager. We showed him the problem in the room and he was able to take us to another room that had a raised, accessible toilet complete with grab bars. He also promised to build a new ramp for us the next day which was done. The changes were enough to allow me the freedom to come and go on my own so after some early anxiety it all worked out. The rest of the resort was fairly accessible, and because it was a smaller resort it was very easy to get everywhere I wanted to go without major exertion. We had previously stayed at a mega resort, so I found this resort much easier to get around in. I needed some assistance to get into the multi-level a la carte restaurants. Last year we stayed at the Barcelo Maya on the Mayan Riviera. I had taken my manual chair. It is a very nice resort, reasonably accessible, but as it is a mega resort it is a long way to everything. Previous to that we stayed at the Samba Vallarta in Nuevo Vallarta. It is a very small resort, very accessible, and in a very nice location. It would be fine if you are staying for only one week, but if you are staying for two weeks the variety of food might get a little too repetitive. The Gran Porto Real is a midsize resort compared to others we have stayed at. The room was a Junior Suite, which was the largest room we have ever had in Mexico. It was a nice room, very clean, with softer beds and plusher towels than we have come to expect in Mexico. The bathroom was large, with a huge roll-in shower equipped with grab bars. It was easy to get under the sink. The pool was lovely; well situated to catch maximum sun for most of the day. Some days there were not enough lounge chairs to meet demand so it was best to get out early and reserve them. Kids are allowed at this resort so they were quite noisy from time to time. The sister resort (The Royal) across the street is adults-only if you are looking for a quieter place. The beach area in front of the hotel was beautiful. They have done a good job of repairing the beach after the damage from the hurricane. There were lots of lounge chairs available on the beach. There were a lot of Europeans at this hotel and that meant there was a greater lack of beachwear than we had previously experienced. Parents with impressionable children will want to keep that in mind. At the right edge of the hotel property the beach was pretty much washed away so there were a lot of fishing boats moored there. It was not a detriment though. It was fascinating watching the fishermen return with their catch, and the large fish were very tantalizing for people who like to fish. Playa Del Carmen has a law that does not allow vendors on the beach; a pleasant relief to not regularly be hounded to buy their wares. The beach goes for miles and miles with great footing for walking. The main food serving area was nicely located close to the pool area. We were on the all-inclusive plan. For a resort this size there was a lot of selection at every meal. The fruit, breads, desserts, coffee and hot chocolate were the highlights, with great selection and taste. For me, the main dishes were good but not great. For the most part I felt the dishes were very North Americanized whereas I would have liked to see more authentic Mexican food. My traveling companions were happier with the food than I was. There was always a lot of selection and you could always find something to meet your needs and desires. Because the dining area was open air, the food tended to cool off quickly on the plate. At the beach and pool you could find food from late morning until the supper hour. Drink servers regularly came around the pool to take your drink orders. The specialty restaurants, Mexican and Italian, again I found good but not great, but again my traveling companions enjoyed them a lot more than I. For the most part the staff were extremely friendly and helpful, especially the dining and beverage staff. The front desk staff was not always the quickest to help or as cooperative as you would expect. There was Internet access in the hotel but it was somewhat temperamental. Our hotel did make attempts to get us to go visit and upgrade to their sister resort, the Royal, across the street, but we did not find them overly pushy. Some of our party did go check out the Royal, with mixed reviews. The upgrade was not overly expensive but the resort did not have the same Mexican charm; it was more boutique style. It had time-share and permanent residents who were not as friendly as holiday travelers, but it was kid free. Rooms were very similar except each room had a whirlpool tub in the room. There were some language issues, as per usual, and sometimes they stretched the truth. One Guest Services representative was speaking to us, saying she had worked at the resort for three years, but when we requested something, suddenly it was her first day at the resort and she didn\u2019t know if she would be able to meet our request. One nice aspect of staying in Playa Del Carmen was the accessibility to the shops and restaurants on 5th Ave. It was a short walk to 5th Ave. and a great way to spend some time people watching and checking out some of the local flavor and products. You do have to be careful with what you buy because if you are looking for something authentic from Mexico, if you check closely the items may not be made in Mexico. There is lots of foreign jewelry. Overall, we enjoyed our two week stay immensely. We would strongly consider returning to this resort in the future as the issues with accessibility and other concerns were not serious obstacles in the big picture.", "Date": "February 8, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "3.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Manitoba", "Title": "\u201cExcellent location for teens\u201d", "Author": "DVF", "ReviewID": "UR6753335", "Content": "We had a great holiday.

Was looking for a hotel on the beach and within walking distance from 5th Avenue so the Gran Porto Real looked like an excellent choice. They were offering $400 ocean front suites (breakfast only) during Christmas week on Travelocity. All other beachfront hotels either required a 7-day min stay (Shangri-La, La Palapas) or were too far from 5th Avenue in the Playacar section. When we arrived, the front desk first told us that they could not accomodate breakfast only packages in an all inclusive resort (they were afraid we would eat from the dinner buffets?) - they claimed to never have seen the rate and type of reservation offered by Travelocity. When I offered to pay more for an all-inclusive package they told me the hotel was overbooked and offered us a room at another hotel in Playcar that was 1-star lower category and far from 5th Avenue. The staff was rude beyond description especially a young man named Daniel who yelled his responses loudly and at times looked like he wanted to hit me. There was a line of screaming tourists building up after me - mostly American from what I could tell - I personally saw 3 couples being offered rooms in other (inferior) hotels for the same price because the Royal Porto Real was overbooked. I asked to speak with the manager (Lynn) but was told she was off on Christmas break and it was only the reception staff that could talk to me. I asked whether I could use the phone at the reception to call Travelocity (my cell phone battery was dying) but they would not let me. I borrowed a phone from a stranger and got on the phone with Travelocity trying to get them to speak to the Real Resorts reservation department with me on the line. When we finally got through, we were put on hold by Real Resorts until they could 'check the reservations' - we were kept on hold for an hour and then they hung up. Another call to Travelocity and another hold for 30 minutes or so after which they offered to put me up in a hotel across the street the Royal Porto Real for an additional $100 per night. I agreed. When we got to the Royal Porto an upset gentleman at the reception warned me that there was construction going on in the hotel and I should run away. I asked the reception staff and they assured me there was no constrruction anywehere in the hotel. I got my keys, headed to the room and... as luck would have it there was a crew of 6-7 construction workers laying concrete right under my balcony and doing something really loud in the process. I will spare you the rest of the details. Listen to the other fellow travellers on ta.com. The Gran Porto Real is a bait and swith scam - they overbook rooms by the dozens at good rates in the nice hotel and then feed the tourists into inferior sister hotels or places with ongoing construction where no sane person would otherwise stay. If you find yourself in this position it is not easy to find alternative lodging in good rooms elsewhere in Playa on the spot (we tried and failed, PDC is a busy place) so you have to stick with whatever crappy room Real resorts give you. The Gran Porto Real ruined our holiday, don't let them do the same to you. Next time I will stay in one of the cute small hotels like Acanto, Lunata or Mosquito Blue. They are very reasonably priced, really cute looking and people say service is great. True, they are not on the beach but you can always walk over a couple of blocks from the hotel to a 'beach club' that rents chairs and umbrellas. You'll save a few hundred $$$ per night. Besides, very few of the advertised ocean view rooms in the Real hotels face the ocean. Most of them are far removed from the sea (some as far as a few hundred yards) and actually face the street which runs perpendicular to the ocean - you can only see the water if you bend over the railing. If you sit on your balcony to relax (as I like to do) what you see is the balcony of the other hotel...

We didn't mind having to step over a sandbag to then be in beautiful warm, clear water with a sandy bottom. I don't know where the rocks are that have been mentioned here, we didn't see any rocks anywhere in the water in front of the hotel and we watched the staff worked tirelessly each night to improve the beach. The entertainment staff were amazing and really made our whole vacation. They were fun and easy going and encouraged us to participate in activites we may not otherwise have tried and we ended up having more fun then we could have imagined. When they took us out to enjoy the nightlife we always felt safe. Salsa lessons by the pool, water aerobics, bike tour through town, yoga on the beach, the evening shows, all were fun and fabulous.

We booked several months in advance and paid for a junior suite ocean view room. However, when we checked in, we were informed that there weren't any junior suites available. The staff at the front desk was extremely unhelpful and rude and could not offer any explanation as to why our room wasn't available. The desk staff offered a lobster dinner as compensation. We were also given the choice to stay at a sister property in Cancun, but they could not assure us that any rooms would be available once we got there. We took our chances and decided to stay in Playa with the assurance that our junior room would be available the next day. We ended up staying in the standard room the first night and it was a disaster. The room was located by the pool on the roof and it also faced the street. There was noise all hours of the night from doors slamming, people yelling, and street noise. The room itself was small and cramped, and, the toilet overflowed. Again, this was not what we paid for, The second day was spent at the front desk trying to get our room changed to the junior suite. (The desk staff assured us the previous day that a room would be available and to check back in the morning.) Needless to say, the room wasn't ready and we were told to check back around noon. We finally got into the junior suite room that we paid for around 1:00 the second day. The relaxing Christmas vacation that we hoped for was tarnished by the rude desk staff, the time wasted, and the overcrowded conditions at the resort and on the beach.

What's not to love about an all inclusive resort in the sunshine where all your needs are met?!!! Especially if you 're leaving a Canadian winter. Here are my recollections: - The front desk: When we checked in, they asked us if we wanted to upgrade to the newer hotel across the street for $40 per night and we said no. They then asked if we would go there for free and we said no. We had heard that there was construction there so we wanted to stay put. The employee said fine, no problem and assigned us our room. - When you check in, they give you a \"gold membership\" card with lots of free stuff. That's the timeshare \"bait\"- you get free stuff but you have to listen to their spiel. Luckily one of the other guests told us not to redeem the gold card so we didn't have to waste a minute of our time with the timeshare blahblah. -Rooms were clean and tidy and mini-fridge is regularly stocked. Not sure if all rooms have a min-fridge-our room was a junior suite. -The daily buffet was closer to a nice 3 star setup rather than a 5 star. There are several food stations within the buffet so after the first day, we scoped out our favourite foods; the roasted chicken for lunch was my favourite. They could stand to put out less cold cuts; not a lot of people were eating them and they were getting a little sweaty and unattractive after a few hours. The buffet stays open for breakfast, lunch and dinner so it was the most convenient way to eat. - There's also a smaller buffet next to the beach with burgers, fries, guacamole and fixings. My husband enjoyed the burgers. - There are 2 restaurants in addition to the buffet: An Italian restaurant (il Pescatore). We ate there several nights and would give it a pretty good rating. The veal was very nice. There is also a Mexican restaurant that we didn't try. -The hotel has computers near the lobby for internet usage. I think it cost something like 5 pesos for 5 minutes. Bring some US one dollar bills; the front desk can make change if required. There are also cheaper internet cafes with internet phones along the main avenue of the town. Walk 10 minutes and you'll see more than one. Don't buy the phonecards!!! They have lousy phone connections and you can bearly hear anything. - The hotel has a laundry room- very useful !! Just one machine and dryer though. It cost approx 5 dollars to do one load of laundry- not cheap but very convenient. - Exercise Room: my husband said it was excellent, tidy, air-conditioned etc. -The staff: I give them a very good score. Friendly, efficient, no problems. No one asked for tips; although we tipped US $1 dollar bills from time to time. - The pool: a very good size pool. Remember, this is a family hotel so there are kids of all ages and they like to splash around now and then. The parents and kids were all pretty well behaved so I had no problem with it. Although, some couples who want absolute tranquility may not find this to their liking. -The beach : Very nice. Different from Cancun's main hotels; Cancun has no fishing boats anchored. However, Playa Del Carmen has a few small fishing boats along the beach- I thought it was charming. Keep in mind that the scenery is not identical to Cancun . - Cozumel- We took the ferry to Cozumel and, in my opinion, I don't recommend it too much. The town is choc ablock with shops. It's also a port for many large cruise ships. Cozumel strikes me as a tourist trap. The jewellery shops were of a much higher calibre than Playa Del Carmen though; if you like emeralds and diamonds, you might like Cozumel. Although my husband was not keen on their prices! These are just some of my observations. The most important thing, though, is that the whole holiday was tremendously relaxing. The sunshine, food, beer and romance revived my spirits. If we're in Playa in the future, we would probably stay at the Gran Porto Real again.

As soon as we arrived-we ran into the same issues that I had read about. They told us that they had overbooked and we'd have to spend the first night at one of their other-Real facilities. We stayed quite firm with them and they took us around the corner in a hallway to tell us we could have a smaller room for the first night and stay at the Gran Porto Real. The entire 5 days we were there we heard this same story over and over again. We actually should have taken their offer because we could have ended up across the street and that facility is only one year old. After all that minor mess, we had an excellent time with NO complaints. The staff was extremely helpful. The food at the Italian restaurant was my favorite. But--we ate at all the restaurants and have no complaints. We met some couples and all tried the room service food which was also excellent. The evening entertainment was interesting and entertaining. My husband and I only had 4 nights, so we didn't do any of the day trips or excursions. We spend the entire time at the resort and on 5th Avenue. 5th avenue and plenty of shopping is only 2 blocks away. As I had read on \"Trip Advisor\", the beach directly in front of the resort has quite a few sandbags and isn't very large. But if you walk a little to the left, the beach is large and gorgeous.

I decided to write a review, because I found the ones I read while choosing a destination really helpful. It is lengthy but bear with me, because there were so many nice things to say about our trip. We were booked to stay at the Gran Porto's sister resort the Real Playa del Carmen, but after reading some not so great reviews on this webiste, I contacted the resort about moving to Gran Porto. It was as easy as emailing and spending an extra $136...well worth EVER penny. We arrived on Oct. 15 and left on Oct. 21. We rented a car and drove down there. While the resodrt does not have \"official\" parking, one of the bellmen was very kind to find us a parking space while we checked in. We could not get to our room until 3:00, so we enjoyed some drinks in the lobby bar, and my husband got his football fix for the day! The first room they gave us was 2 doubles, but that was quickly fixed the next day to be a king bed. The room was huge by hotel standards, and the bathroom was beautiful with a spacious shower. The bed was hard, but we are in another country...Nothing is like you bed at home! The A/C worked wonderfully the whole time which was good because it was hot. They have a wide variety of food and places to eat at Porto Real. It is buffet food in the main resturant, but we enjoyed everything we had to eat. We throughly enjoyed our dinner at Maria's and the Italian resturant. The food was delicous and we could order as much as we wanted. We only ate 3 meals away from the resort. The drinks were plentiful and there were people ready to give you one at anytime or place. We came home well feed! If you are looking for 5 star food, then I don't think any AI package will work for you. We enjoyed not having to worry about how much things cost. If you are looking for a fun day trip, you have to check out Xcaret...It is a nature preseve about 20 miles from Playa. It was gorgeous, full of things to do and well worth the money. We both agreed it was one of our favorite parts. We also took the ferry to Cozumel one day which was alot of fun also. We shopped and spent some quality time at Senor Frogs. The terminal to the ferry was a nice walk down 5th Avenue, which was a great place to shop and eat. We ate dinner at a resturant called the Blue Lobster on friday night, and it was the best lobster I have ever had! Sitting by the pool can also be very entertaining...The 1 o'clock water polo match between Italy vs. The Rest of the World is a must see! They have lots of activities you can join in or just watch from the side of the pool. The service and everyone that helped ua at the resort was unbelieveably wonderful. I don't think we have encountered so many friendly people ready to help and bring you anything you needed. You are not required to tip, but you want to after all of the wonderful service and happy people. Beware that if you pay for things in US dollars or Euros, you are more then likely going to get pesos back. A good rule of thumb is $10 for every $1 Us dollar...So if you see something cost $188, that is in pesos! We got the hang of it by the end of the week! On the scale of 1 to 10, I would give our honeymoon a 10! We are already talking about going back with friends and staying at the Gran Porto Real. We could not imagine a more perfect way to relax and enjoy our time off from work.

I was a little nervous after reading some of the reviews that were written closer to our departure date. But we decided it all depended on what your expectations were so we adjusted ours a little after reading more reviews. We had a junior suite with ocean view so we weren't near the construction on the south end. Our room was beautiful and spacious as was the bathroom. Very clean and comfortable. We had a private balcony with great ocean view. Everyone was super friendly. The drinks were excellent and free-flowing! The food at the resort was good, not great. However, the breakfast buffets were hard to beat. And there was a lot of variety. There's a jetty just north of the Resort that has an impact on the beach right in front of the resort. So the water's not that beautiful crystal clear blue right there. It\u2019s still clear though and you can wade out to \"blue water\". Also the beach is small. But there are plenty of lounge chairs to hangout in and sunbathe, read, or whatever. And it's just a short walk if you want broader beaches and bluer water. Also, the pools were very nice though we preferred being by the ocean. Basically, we thought it was fantastic. We felt like we got a tremendous deal for our $, such that the few things that weren\u2019t perfect just didn\u2019t matter.

Our rooms were huge and beautiful. I tipped the maid everyday and got cute folded towel art. My girlfriend didnt tip and didnt get it. HAHa cheap a>>! We had a room above the kitchen which was a little loud but we didnt mind because the balcony off our room was unbeilvable w/ longe chairs, table, hammock & flowers all around. Over looked the pool and ocean. My girlfriend balcony was a little tiny thing but she had a better view of the ocean. They will move your room if you want with no hassle. The bathroom....I wanted to pack it in my suitcase. The shower!!! Mini bar. You only get four beers a day and the maids wouldnt give us more. Weird I thought. I had to tell my girlfriend and hubby to BYOB. Toward the end of our stay we found the snack bar. They have bottles and beer there. You just take it to your room. We ate twice at the italian restaurant. Make your reservations when you check in. They are booked solid. The mexican one was ok. The buffet restaurant was our favorite. Different food and lots of choices each day. Drinks were good. Hotel entertainment was not impressive. Time share beware. Just dont do it. Unless you are short on cash and have time you want to give away. My Husband decided we should do the \"not time share\" time share. For a free breakfast and $100 trip voucher. We get free breakfast already and 3hours of my vacation is worth more the 100 bucks. I ended up leaving the FREE breakfast in tears without brkfst or voucher. It was aweful. We loved the pool and the beach. The pool with the swim up bar is not located with beach view. Its on top of the building overlooking construction(at the time '04) and rooms the look like motel 6 on the other side. Not my taste but my girlfriend and hubby liked it. The hot tub is up above that with unbelielvable views of Playa. We broke in after hours just for pictures and a little alone time. In a resort it is a little diffiucult if you know what I mean. Chairs at pool were an issue but big deal get in the pool instead or lay by the ocean. There was always open chairs there. If you like topless sunbathing or watching the left side of the hotel beach was full of hot Mamas and Grandmamas and old men in speedos! The boats everyone talks about added to my Mexican Yucatan experience. Go to Cancun if you want fake Mexico. My husband & his buddy went out fishing with one of the boat owners in front of the beach. He had a wonderful time...no fish but was worth the 20 bucks for the beer, boat ride and the local conversation. Dont let the neg. people stop you from going here. The beach is warm, bright and beautiful. Go left or right if you need \"perfect\" beaches. The sand bags...Are there to help the beach not be washed away. Its no big deal really. We went on a snorkling trip. You must do this! Ive been to other the parks..(Xhala & Xcret).There is nothing like going into the ocean (with a guide). Yes the parks are pretty but the fish and coral are nothing like what you'll see in the ocean. The package we bought took us snorkling, cenotes, cave swimming and lunch. The cenotes were ok. I jumped off a cliff that was exciting but other then that it was boring. The cave we went into wasnt very exciting either unless you like to swim in bat poop. We did get a cool picture in the cave but ....Gross. You could see all the bat poop at the bottom of the water and there were to maen people. The great thing about the hotel is that you can walk everywhere. Lunch was provided by an authentc native Mexican family. A little scary at first. The guys ate everything. I didnt. It was good food. My best part was there hut was right there and there beautiful children. I asked to take pictures of the children and gave them treats. Very sweet people. Ferry 3 bucks from the hotel to go to Cozumel. I wasnt impressed Cozumel. We just shopped. Maybe if you stay in a resort its better. I wish we would have snorkled there too. FYI...I love mango and bought it from a vender on the street. SO STUPID. I was sick like the flu sick for a day. Other then that we were all healthy the whole trip. We were worried about the weather in October. The weather was awesome. It rained(down poored) one day so we bought rain coats in the gift shop( spendy bring your own if you think it could rain) and went shopping. Oh and have lobster. We went to the Blue ? I forget. On the left of the ave with balcony you can see from the road. It was so sweet and melted in your mouth.

Mattresses are motionless and I found them to be extremely comfortable. The shower stall is amazing. The a la carte restaurants are very good and portions my be smaller for the men but if you are going all inclusive...just order another meal. We found if we tipped, we got above average service from the wait staff. No tipping...they are still pleasant. The spa has a hot tub, sauna and steam room. There's also a cold plunge that felt wonderful and help to reduce the swelling of much walking in the market. Make sure not to stay on 5ht avenue. Too expensive. Take the $3.00 cab ride to the ferry and walk your way back. They don't deal on 5th avenue. The only 2 things I would warn against are that they have REAL time share people in the lobby -- but they are not overly aggressive and the fact that check in is at 3:00. Our travel agent did not tell us that and we had to wait from 10:30 a.m. to 2:00 pm to get our room. They put your bracelet on and you can enjoy all the amenities but that's a long time to wait after travelling for almost a whole day.

Franklin was our waiter in the morning and always a pleasure to talk to and would always go out of his way to get you what you needed. The beach in front of the resort was not the greatest, but just go for a walk in either direction to find a great place to swim. It is a very busy beach area.

They told us we could have a free breakfast and tour of the Royal Porto Real and talk to someone about being a Real Club member. DONT FALL FOR THIS, IT IS A TIME SHARE IN DISGUISE!! Even though it says tax and tips included in the all-inclusive, I would say about 50% of the staff made you feel you owed them a tip.

We booked through Thomas Cook in the UK & requested an ocean view, which is exactly what we got. I can see why people have had bad experiences as the rooms towards the rear of the hotel are affected by external building work so make sure you request a sea view room at the front. We have never been all inclusive before and have heard bad reports from friends however we really wanted to go to Playa del Carmen & didnt really have much alternative option, but we were pleasantly surprised. The hotel classes itself as 5* - I would say it was a good 4* We did not get any hassle from anyone with regard to time shares, we did get asked if we wanted to upgrade to the other hotel but declined and that was that. Our room was great and totally spotless, the maids serviced the room 3 times a day and even returned whilst you were out at dinner to re-make the beds, leaving choccies on the pillow. Mini-bar was restocked on a daily basis. We booked a junior suite which cost a small supplement but definately worth it. Food was alot better than we expected. The choice in the buffet restaurant was really good, especially at breakfast with freshly made waffles, pancakes, omlettes on top of all the usual. We tried both restaurants which were good - a bit odd though that the Italian doesnt serve pizza? The hotel is not a big self contained resort, if thats what you want you should go book a big self contained resort! It was perfect for what we were looking for which was a good standard of hotel with excellent access to Playa del Carmen - which is a really nice resort -& surrounding area. Night time entertainment was pretty basic with the same 6 dancers doing different themed dances for 6 nights a week - which if you look at the funny side of it was actually quite amusing to watch. The only down side of this hotel was the loud obnoxious americans - (not saying that they all were and they didnt have much effect on the atmosphere) Some of their attitudes were shocking, I know it was all inclusive but these people almost expected their backsides to be wiped as part of the package!

First of all, I want to warn you that this is quite a lengthy and detailed review, which you may not want to read entirely. However, I assume since you took the time to use this website, you would like to gather as much information as possible on this hotel before booking your trip. I will also warn you that overall, my experience with the HOTEL was very bad, and therefore, there is some bias in my review. However, I will still be objective in my review and provide both the positives and negatives of this hotel. THE GOOD\u2026 Let\u2019s begin with the positives. The location is pretty good, depending what you are looking for. It is beachfront, as it says, and it is right in Playa del Carmen. It is good if you want to do some shopping on 5th avenue (which is overpriced, for the most part). It is in a very touristy area, therefore, you will find it is a bit commercial \u2013 there is even a McDonald\u2019s on 5th avenue. If you want the beach and tons of local shops nearby, then this hotel or any hotel in its proximity is a good choice (based on location). If you are looking for a more secluded hotel with a more private beach and away from everything, then do not book here. Staff/Entertainment Most of the staff is nice. Specifically I am referring to restaurant staff and housekeeping, as well as the entertainment staff. I noticed someone had mentioned Spike\u2019s name in a previous review, and I also want to mention that he was great with us too. If you are looking for a place to party at night, talk to Spike and he will give you good advice. Also, our waiter at the Mexican restaurant at the hotel was also very good. If I remember correctly, his name was Manuel, and he was the only person on our whole trip who actually asked how our vacation was going. He seemed to be a very genuine person. I think at most hotels you would stay you will find that the restaurant staff and the entertainment staff will always be nice to you since they are usually the ones who have direct contact with the visitors at the hotel. You would think that would be the same for the staff at the front desk. Unfortunately, this was not the experience I had\u2026but I will get into more detail on that later. Food The food is ok. The Mexican restaurant I enjoyed. The Italian restaurant I did not. I thought that most Italian restaurants would at least make half-decent Italian food. This may be true in most parts of the world, but not on planet Gran Porto Real. The buffets were okay too. Breakfast tended to be better than other meals. Much of the food at dinner is fried, however you will also find grilled foods and some vegetables. If you have checked out websites and noticed it has a Health/Sushi bar and you are looking forward to it, you will be disappointed. They serve the same food as the beach bar, which are nachos and hamburgers. Not that I don\u2019t enjoy nachos and hamburgers, but not at the health/sushi bar. I asked the bartender about it and he said it\u2019s just a name. They used to have a health/sushi bar a few years back, he told me, but obviously not anymore. Drinks The drinks are good and bad. The good part is they give a good amount of alcohol in the drinks, like many places in Mexico do. Not that I\u2019m a heavy drinker (only got drunk once in 7 days), but once in a while it is nice to taste the sweet nectar of liquor in your drink. The bad part is that if you order any drinks mixed with juices they are all made with frozen mixes, i.e., they are not made with fresh fruit. Therefore, they are very sugary as well. If you are a beer-drinker, then I guess you don\u2019t have a problem. THE BAD\u2026 As you may have noticed, I have been rating various aspects of my experience on a sliding scale, and have finally reached the negatives. Beach Let\u2019s begin with the beach. I am specifically referring to the beach right in front of the hotel. If you have browsed through pictures on various websites, then you will have noticed that there are boats docked in front of the hotel. This is an accurate depiction of what you will experience while getting your daily dose of Vitamin D in front of the hotel. Should you decide to jump in the water to cool-off from the Mexican sun, be sure to watch your step so that you don\u2019t trip over the numerous sandbags situated along the shoreline. Once you made it to the water, it is best to float along slowly rather than sprinting in due to the numerous rocks that are all waiting for the chance to slash your soles. I will provide you with a solution to these problems: just walk across to the beach in front of the sister hotel, the Royal porto real, and lay on the sand there. If you walk past that a little bit, the beach is perfect. No rocks in the water, and no sandbags. However, if you think the sister hotel, the Royal Porto, will let you use their beach chairs (or whatever they\u2019re called) you are sadly mistaken. My girlfriend and I were told to leave since we had pulled some of those chairs closer to the shore to sit down. Even though the chairs were about 90% empty, a man approached us and told us we could not use the chairs. When we explained to him that we were staying at the hotel next door and nobody was using the chairs, he proceeded to call security on his walkie-talkie. Luckily, we had brought our beach towels with us and lay in the sand of the public beach away from his sacred beach chairs. If you are asking yourself how he knew we were from the other hotel, the Gran porto gives you some very nice neon-yellow plastic wristbands in order to distinguish you from the guests of the Royal porto, with their much more subtle purple wristbands. Just so you know, if you want to see the Royal and its pools and entertainment, you will also not be able to do that, despite what your rep may tell you (as we were told by our Nolitours rep). However, you will have the chance to upgrade to the Royal for just a small fee. And you will be reminded of this every morning, with a pleasant note placed under your door, and every time you visit the front desk\u2026(segway)\u2026 Room & Front Desk Finally, I will tell you about my experience when I had just arrived. When we arrived, we were told that we were moved from a standard suite (which we had paid for) to a junior suite (which was an upgrade). So obviously we were happy about it. The reason for the change was the fact that there was construction in our standard suite area, and they were taking care of us. When we had originally booked the room at the Flight Centre, three weeks before our trip, there was no mention of construction by Nolitours (a subsidiary of Airtransat). However, I did get a call from the Flight centre rep about 2 or 3 days before our departure date and he told us about the construction problem, which Nolitours had just told him about. Our options were to cancel, book at another hotel (at our expense, of course) or to go to the hotel, where we will be moved away from the construction area. Although my girlfriend and I were hesitant, we had heard about friends of ours having similar bad experiences, but the hotel and the tour operator took care of them. So we decided, after consulting with the Flight centre rep, that we would go to the hotel we originally booked with: the Gran Porto Real. Back to the front desk. So we took our bags to our assigned room. When we entered, we saw that our king-sized bed I requested, had been inexplicably converted into two double beds. Although I consider myself to be a strong, young lad, I had problems pushing the two beds together due to the immovable marble table situated between the two beds. We continued to walk through the room, which was a pretty good size, until we reached the curtains. When I pulled back on the curtains\u2026well, I think a picture is worth a thousand words, so I have attached a few pictures of our view so you can judge for yourself. When I proceeded back down to the front desk to ask them to change our room because I wanted a different view, they told me to come back the next day because everything was full. When I returned the next day, with the Nolitours rep, Maria Cruz, they said there were no other Junior suites available and that we should come back the next day. I was hesitant, however, Maria told me she would take care of it the next day. The next day came and I went to meet Maria at 8am at the hotel lobby, but she was not there. I located her at around 11 am and we went to speak with the manager, Nicolas Vasquez. He offered me a different room and my girlfriend and I went to check it out. Although our original room offered both a riveting visual and audio experience of the construction, the acoustics in the new room they offered us were much better. Despite it being a view of the street, it sounded as if the construction crew was trying to smash the wall down outside our door. So I returned and told them it was worse. Mr. Vasquez basically told me, in as rude a manner as possible, to take it or leave it because there were no other Junior suites available. This was difficult to comprehend given the fact we had been told the day before that the hotel was not very busy and we did not need to make reservations at the a la carte restaurants due to the fact there were not many guests. He said they did me a favour by upgrading me to a Junior suite. I told him to put me back in a standard suite away from the construction since I was sick of waking up at 6am to the sound of jackhammers and drills. And that\u2019s when we discovered that there were NO standard suites away from the construction. So I asked to be upgraded and he told me to pay for it. Maria, our Nolitours rep, did nothing either. She called her boss but her boss did not want to pay for us to upgrade. Thanks Nolitours! So we stayed in that room for the rest of the vacation. CONCLUDING THOUGHTS\u2026 I know that this review was very lengthy, but I thought I should warn you of our experience. This was not isolated either, as we came to find out that almost everyone that had booked with Nolitours (which is a large Canadian tour operator) had the same or similar experience: they booked without knowing about the construction and then found out just before the trip (or in one case, in his second day at the resort) that there was construction. Some people were moved, some were not. I guess if I had yelled obscene remarks in the hotel manager\u2019s face it might have made a difference. So my advice is, if you still decide on staying at the Gran Porto Real, do NOT book a standard suite. I am sure you can tell by my pictures that this construction has been around for quite some time and will not be done in the near future. If you book a junior suite, you are taking your chances. If you book ocean view, you will have no problem with your room\u2026maybe. If you have any questions at all, please do not hesitate to contact me. My email address is espinoza_michael@hotmail.com. I will be contacting Nolitours and Airtransat to see what they are going to do about this situation, because it honestly left a very sour taste in my mouth that such a large company like Nolitours would screw us \u2013for lack of a better phrase - and it was difficult to really enjoy the trip after wasting three days with this hassle. The icing on the cake was delay on the flight home. We arrived at 3:30am instead of the 10:30pm scheduled time.

So notwithstanding my natural reluctance in my various travels all these years, I chose to jump into a hassle free, getaway with the family the week before they had to return to school. Now I did so with a certain amount of dread and anticipation recognizing that based on my luck (no luck whatsoever) that I might possibly be inviting danger :) So imagine my surprise with 3 days prior to departure that we are notified that there is construction going on at the site that leaves us with choices according to the booking agent (who bless her cotton socks is the star in all of this)! Choices are to cancel (time already booked out from work, kids quite excited about the trip and the evident disappointment if we were to cancel), book another hotel that is part of the Real Resort properties at any additional costs, or get moved to a part of the hotel, that was away from the construction. After much conversation with my wife we decided if they can move us away from the construction zone, we hopefully would not be spending too much time in the rooms and as such it would be a small inconvenience. So we arrive and get told the adjoining rooms for us and our 2 teens (16, 13) were not currently available, thus we are upgraded to junior suites on two different floors that meant that we split up and my dear wife and I each hang with one of the kids on separate floors. I would have to say that Real Resorts practice bait & switch tactics. Let me explain. I noted that I was not the only hotel guest being upgraded that evening. In fact, at least five other guests to my knowledge were upgraded to junior suites (3 families, a young couple, and two single guys out for fun and sharing a room). The junior suites are quite nice and beautifully outfitted. If anything there is almost too much room (trust me that they could have used the overall space of the hotel and make the standard rooms a tad larger). I found the standard rooms to be overly cozy, yes, they were tight and of the many rooms we viewed, none actually overlooked the beach/pool, unless you count those in the area that overlooked the upstairs pool numbered in the 400\u2019s. Therefore, Monday morning per instructions we reported to the front desk and for 10 a.m. and spent the next two hours arguing and negotiating with management. The one thing that they always stuck in our face as they did the very first night, was what our interest would be in transferring to the Royal Porto Real across the street for USD 40 a night more per room. This became a standard part of the pitch to the extent that each night a flyer was pushed through the door with that offer. Add to that a similar offer was made to move up to junior suites inside the Gran Porto Real. With my frustration growing that for a 7 day holiday (with travel 5 days) I was still unpacked, we took a look at the standard rooms and guess and found they backed onto the construction. At that point, I picked up my cell and called our travel agent back Canada. She had spoken to the folks directly at the hotel and they had promised to have us away from the construction site. About two hours later management indicated that we would have a couple of rooms next to each other, rather than adjoining ( important for those families with kids that need a degree of privacy; but where you feel you or they should have immediate access at anytime to each other) for the following day. However he graciously put in that he could offer us a deal of only USD 30 a night to upgrade per room for the rest of our stay to junior suites, or alternatively for USD 40 a night per room an upgrade to the Royal Porto Real across the street We were told that we could keep the two junior suites for another night and that the next day (Tuesday) we should turn up at 11 a.m. and that two rooms would be provided in the 400 area ( third floor but in an area overlooking the street( above the Spa/Mexican in-house restaurant) in front of the hotel near the pool with the swim up bar . Day 3 into our holiday and we have not unpacked and we have to wait until 11 a.m The Manager that had dealt with us on Monday had the day off Tuesday and had not bothered to tell us that he would be off and worse hadn\u2019t bothered to tell the Supervisor of our problem. So I had to regurgitate and go through the same situation to someone else. Per the instructions of our helpful booking agent, we wanted to view the rooms prior to saying yes. We were then told that the two rooms side by each (415 & 416) A/C wasn\u2019t working in one of those rooms and as such we would in fact be provided with rooms on the 500 number level. The room was a standard and tight (as previously mentioned all the standard rooms we saw were tight). It backed onto the construction (as did all the standard rooms and quite a number of the junior suites), as we walked in to check the room, the maids were cleaning and someone was painting the lamps in the room, that was meant for us or our kids. I wasn\u2019t happy and I really didn\u2019t want to get into a serious amount of conversation, I just wanted to unpack and start enjoying my holiday. I went back downstairs with my wife and in essence was ready to give them a piece of my mind and then just buy the damn upgrade to go across the street; however the Supervisor recognizing my evident distaste and disgust, suggested that the junior suite next to the one that I already occupied with my son was available and that they would put us up in there at no additional cost. I acquiesced more because I was getting to the point where I was ready to lose it and also because I was now willing to pay to get peace of mind and start enjoying my holiday. So, we got two junior suites 371 & 373, as mentioned quite spacious (too much room); but we had the good luck to have the construction site as our view out the balcony and of course the non-stop noise of the kitchen to deal with at all times (I really do mean at all times). Noise carries in this place. So enough about my specific adventures, let me try and now provide a somewhat more balanced and objective view of the services. The Staff Hmmm\u2026..most of the staff I found to be incredibly friendly and helpful. My favourites being Theresa & Miriam who served the pool area and ensured I was never without a Dos Equuis. Then my buddy Ivan one of the waiters at the a la carte Marias ( the \u201cMexican restaurant\u201d) who provided great service and had a wonderful sense of humour. The Food Oh dear\u2026I am deemed somewhat demanding even by my family so you have to balance that with my comments. First most of the chefs at the Gran Porto Real tend to have somewhat of a liberal interpretation of dishes. In the buffet, breakfast is not a bad meal. I enjoyed all my breakfasts there, as the selection is extensive. Lunches were not bad either as the burgers was consistently good, and they invariably had some grilled/bbq foods such as chicken, ribs, sausage and a number of pastas and Mexican influenced (?) dishes. My kids made good use of the numerous fruits/fruit juices available and pastries galore etc. In the evenings, something happened to the food, I think it went substantially downhill at the buffet and I am not sure why; my kids would often thumb their nose up and indicate that they had a preference to dine out with us. Despite the fact that we paid to eat there we ate away from the hotel and its restaurants as often as we ate there where lunch or dinner was concerned. Maria\u2019s \u2013 The Mexican a La Carte\u2026 Most of the dishes weren\u2019t at all bad. Portions are tiny by North American standards but were fine for me (233lbs), service as I mentioned was generally very very good. IL Pescatore \u2013 The Italian Restaurant I am not sure where to start laughing or what\u2019s more ironic. That a restaurant that is named after fish has two fish dishes (salmon being one) and that the food is really, bad. (a couple of other folks who ate there suggested to me it wasn\u2019t so bad, so there is some balance for you). The one time I ate there with my family we all sent our stuff back. Two of us had the shrimp risotto (atrocious), which was a very slovenly and lazy interpretation by the chef. A very pleasant young woman (maybe the maitre d\u2019) asked me after the meal if I had enjoyed my meal, to which I responded would she really like to know. Poor thing said yes and so I shared with her my abject disgust at having to be subjected to long grain rice in a soupy tomato broth with burnt shrimp being paraded as shrimp risotto. The evident dismay was not by any means rewarding; but one has to sometimes speak up. Beach The beach is not bad; but it is relatively small and the sea itself is very shallow ibnfrontof t he beach as one can walk out to for maybe 60 metres and still kneel and have most of one\u2019s body well above water. The numerous sandbags and the fishing, snorkeling boats, that are moored on the beach prevent a certain amount of access. Activities Numerous activities including sailing and kayaking in particular, much of the other activities one had to pay for. Pool and Pool Activities I had never been in a pool where you can walk across any part of it and still swim quite well. The pool at its deepest was only 5ft 3in, so quite neat for those not strong swimmers, but still deep enough for swimmers. Each day they had pool activities from aqua aerobics, volleyball to water polo, which was a great way to socialise. In summary. Would I return, absolutely not. Would I try Real Resorts other properties, no, as I felt my experience was tainted and the consistency of the push to upgrade internally or to one of their other properties was too severe and suggests to me that its' an overall corporate approach that doesnt work for me.", "Date": "September 6, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "4", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "SF Bay Area", "Title": "\u201cBe careful of the food and noise; learned the hard way\u201d", "Author": "shapnup", "ReviewID": "UR5765665", "Content": "My wife and I just returned from a 5 night all-inclusive trip here.

I took 34 family members (half kids, half adults). Everyone had a great time. The hotel was very nice, exceeding our expectations and the staff bent over backwards to make sure that we had everything we wanted or needed during our stay. We were a little concerned about a few things before the trip because of some of the reviews we had read, but that was all put to rest once we arrived. The grounds are extremely well kept, everything felt comfortable and the architecture was very high-class, yet authentic Mexican. You really felt like you were in a 4-star resort. The hotel was not overbooked and we all got the rooms we requested. The Jr. Suites we very spacious -- much bigger than almost any hotel room I've ever stayed in the US (I've stayed in hundreds all over the country). The bathrooms were very nice and the showers were to die for. The views from all of the ocean view and ocean front rooms are great. Check-in was a breeze, but there was a bit of a wait at check-out because so many people were all trying to leave at the same time. Any no, no one got hit with any unexpected or hidden charges upon check-out. The noise level was not really bad in any of our rooms (we had 9 rooms -- 5 ocean views and 4 that overlooked the construction of the new building next store). Even the construction view rooms were nice and everyone that had one confirmed that what they gave up in view was worth it for the money they saved. The food at the Albatross buffet was about on par with most Las Vegas buffets -- most was adequate, but very good and some excellent. The Mexican restaurant -- Maria's was our least favorite -- decent, but nothing to write home about. The Italian restaurant was much nicer, bigger portions, very good quality, great taste, excellent presentation and fast, courteous service. Plus, unlike the other restaurants, it was air conditioned. The beach restaurant (palapa) was nice too. Everyday they served hotdogs, hamburgers, quesadillas, chips and queso, french fries, ceviche' (very good), etc. It was good and extremely convenient, especially if you did not feel like putting on shoes and a shirt to go inside for lunch. You get room service for free once a day with the AI plan. The kids really liked this, ordering breakfast some days, lunch others and dinner one night. The room service food was very good and much better than we or anyone else we talked to had expected. The bar and wait staff were the best!!! Theresa, our go-to waitress around the pool was fabulous and was always there when you wanted a drink. She even brought extras incase you happened to miss her on her last round. Miguel, Alejandro, Norbert and the rest of the bartenders were fast with the drinks, poured/mixed/blended whatever you wanted, however you wanted it and as strong or weak as you desired ALL the time. After a couple of drinks, they usually knew what you wanted even before you asked. One thing that we did was ask for the premium liquors in our drinks so that they did not pour the cheap stuff. It doesn't cost anything extra, so you might as well get the good stuff. They will pour Suaza Commemeritivo, Absolut, etc, if you ask. But, the hotel only serves Dos XX on tap and only stocks it in the mini-fridges (mini-fridge is free and each day they will stock it with 2 bottled beers, about 6 bottled waters, cokes, diet cokes, V-8, etc. *** Note, a tip along with a note requesting extra cervezas always got us more beers in the fridge. There is also a beach bar towards the north end of the hotel. It has swings for chairs -- cool. The only bad thing is that it shuts down at 5:00. The Pool Bar closes between 10:30 and 11:30 each night and then the lobby bar will stay open for another hour or two after that. So, if you want to party late, you either have to do it in your room, bring drinks from your room or the 24-hour self-serve lounge (stocked with beer tap, various liquors, wine and champagne) or go out to the clubs. The pool is really nice. Everyone loved it. We never had to fight for chairs there or at the beach. There ware plenty of activities to keep everyone happy too -- pool and beach volleyball, water polo, water aerobics, horseshoe tournaments, kayaks, bingo, etc. The activities directors were REALLY good. Spike (head activities guy) was a kick in the butt. He even went out with us a couple of nights to Senor Frogs and Mambo Cafe. Too much fun or \"Oh my gato\" as he would say!!! We did not really spend much time at the 3rd floor pool with the swim up bar. It stayed fairly deserted most of the time. It was small, but still nice and the bar shut done everyday by about 5:00. The beach right behind the hotel was not really that great. We did not spend a whole lot of time there. First of all, the pool area and bars were too much fun, and secondly, if we wanted to hit the beach, we just walked 3 or 4 minutes over to the beach at the Royal (next door) which was great. In truth, no one in our group or hardly anyone else we talked too seemed to care too much about it either. Several of us booked a 4-hour fishing trip in Puerto Morelos through Best Day Tours in the lobby. The trip was nice. We fish out of El Cid marina on the 34' Il Pescadora II, a nice, well-equipped boat. The fishing was so-so, we only caught a few yellow tail snappers and I landed a 5' barracuda -- nice fight and good eating. We brought our filleted fish back to the hotel and Carlos (manager at Albatross) arranged for the chef to prepare half for lunch and the other half for dinner -- at no additional cost. They made a big deal out of it, putting on a nice show and wonderful presentation; bring out our grilled fish on big platters with garnish and side dishes like rice with shrimp and vegetables. It was great. Others in the group booked everything from Jungle Tours, snorkeling and fishing trips, and trips to Cozumel to the Pirate Ship lobster dinner cruise. Most trips were booked through the dive shop on the grounds -- in the hall next to the pool. They enjoyed everything except the jungle tour on the jet skis (boring). And, don't expect to catch many fish if you book a trip with the boats docked behind the hotel. As for the boats behind the hotel, the hotel can\u2019t do anything about it. The beach and the water are public property and the GPR sits on the calmest beach around -- that's why the boats dock there. All in all, it really was not that bad though. The Kid's Club was great too. The kids (ages 3-10) enjoyed it a lot. There were plenty of organized and semi-organized activities to keep them busy. The location of the GPR is superb. It is just a one and a half block walk to Fifth Ave. -- the main drag with all the shops, bars and restaurants. *** Note, EVERYTHING costs less if you go a block off of 5th. There are ATMs everywhere (none in the hotel though) and the closest bank (Scotia Bank) is just 2 1/2 blocks straight down the street from the hotel. Nothing was stolen from anyone in our group or anyone else we spoke to at the hotel. *** Note, we felt VERY safe both on the hotel grounds and walking the streets of Playa. I've been to the big super resorts before and you just feel like you get lost in the crowd. The GPR only has around 300 rooms and that means that the staff really gets a chance to know you and vice-versa. We felt at home. Everyone in our group has said that they would definitely return to the GPR again and I really believe them. I know that we will likely be back too. There is no doubt that you definitely get your money's worth at the Gran Porto Real. I will post trip pictures as soon as I am able to get them all grouped together and uploaded.

Before making our reservation we had read the reviews and went along with the postive views that other people had said about hotel. However, it was completely the opposite and we should had listen to the negative reviews. They were more accurate. My husband, daughter and I stayed for two nights at the hotel and we where lucky to only be there for two days and not our whole vacation. The staff is very unfriendly and unattentive. The food in the buffet was horrible along with their service. They are short staffed at the bar and you have to wait a long timefor your water down drinks that by the way are the worst. Their margaritas and pina coladas are sweet with no taste to pina or margarita. If you can't swim forget about getting inside their pool because both of them are five and half feet deep. My daughter is 10 and is only four feet three. And if you want to sit by the pool there are bugs and mosquitos flying around you. And no one in sight to provide you with a water don drink. And that is only the beginning, when we arrived at our room, we realized that our mini bar was not full. It took the hotel several hours to fill it after we requsted the service. Our balcony door latch was broken and the rail from the baclony was loose and nothing was done when I reported the problem. Also the so called concierge was never available. I didn't know what came with the alleged all inclusive package was about. To top it off when we were finally leaving that hell hole hotel,we received a notice satating that our water and electricity was going to be cut off due to inspections from the CFE (Mexico's Electric Company) also the bell boy never came to assist us with our luggage, we decided to leave after we realized that it had been over half hour since we had requested one to come to assist us.

The food was really good. We ate at the buffet as well as Maria's and the Italian place. We also ate tacos on 5th ave at the intersection of the main hotel road and 5th. They were excellent. Hair braiding was expensive, but like all things, you have to negotiate. We had two heads with long hair done for $80. The fishing is the same. Go see Jose on the beach. He made us a good deal. We also went to Xhel-ha and I highly recommend that. We used the spa and the gym at the hotel, both were great. All the activities put on by the hotel were very nice. The staff was great and the facilities awesome. We wanted to hear about the time share, but could not find the time to go over there with all there was to do. We did talk to another couple from Oklahoma and they told us a little about the deal. It does sound like a pretty good deal. But they said allow for more than the 90 minutes they tell you. We had a great family vacation at a great resort. We have traveled to Jamaica, Hawaii and Mexico and this was better that Jamaica and compreable to Hawaii. I think some people can find something to complain about even in paradise! If you have any questions, please fee free to email me.

We had 6 people in our group, ages 17 to 43. Our vacation was spectacular. We plan to go back this fall/winter. We had excellent service, especially in the restaraunts. We aren't buffet type people, but we ate the dinner buffet the first night and it was pretty good. We thought the breakfast buffet was very good. The chefs will prepare anything you like. We really enjoyed Maria's and Il Pescatore, the food was very good. We went bill fishing and Ricardo at the main restaraunt prepared some of our fish one evening. It was absolutely delicious and they even had a special table waiting for us with a bottle of wine, etc. Another night, our son turned 21 and Maria's captain, Eleazar, had a cake prepared for him, served him a special birthday drink, in addition to the usual welcome drinks at Maria's, etc. Every encounter with hotel staff was excellent. The service was better than we could imagine. Upon arrival, we did ask for extra hangers but never received them, but that was the only oversight we experienced. Everything else was great. We loved the location. Close to shopping, beach clubs down the beach, but not too close. The rooms were nice. We had the Junior Suites which had a nice view of the ocean from the balcony. Not all of the rooms have ocean views though. Ocean front is an upgrade. We did not upgrade but still had nice view. We also went bill fishing on Albatros Charters. The whole family went. It was an excellent experience. We caught a 150+ pound shark, a white marlin, 2 mahi mahi, 3 barracudas, bonitas (one was the shark bait), a tuna got away. The crew of the Albatros were incredible. They were busy changing bait, cleaning the boat, etc. the entire trip. They even offered to prepare us fish quesadillas on the boat, but we had the hotel prepare us a box lunch for the trip. FYI: No bananas on the boat. Bad Luck for fishing. We threw them overboard. As you can see, we had pretty good luck with the fishing!!! We also rented a van and went to Tulum to see the ruins. Very pretty and interesting but go early to avoid the crowds. FYI: entrance is $4.50 USd as opposed to the $45 and up charge to go with group. You can also pay a guide once you get there. We opted to do our own thing though. We wish we were still there. Had a great time.

My husband and I took our 14 month old to visit this hotel for the first time. I was very apprehensive after reading all the reviews, but, decided to tough it out anyways and see for myself. Well, I should've believed and heed the warnings on the reviews. Pros: - Rooms : We had suite #153, it was georgeous, big stone carved posts and lots of beautiful carved framed mirrors, door, and headboard. The suite had 2 balconies, 1 faces the street and a separate one that faces the beach. It was the last suite on the ground floor and only 10 steps away from the beach bar. The suite was huge, with huge shower, which the pressure and temperature was excellent. We lucked out in this sweet since it faced the Royal hotel (sister hotel) and it's the same side where the winds were constantly blowing. If you were in the other suites, you wont get any breeze at all and it can be hot. You don't even get the breeze in the pool, since the hotel blocked all the breeze. Can't complain about the suite itself. - Service: Was excellent. At all the bars, we didn't have to wait for more than 1 min to get served. The restaurant staff was wonderful also. They always had a highchair for our baby and made sure they were always clean. - Checkin: We got the room we requested, down to the king sized, oceanview suite with a crib. - Location: It was a couple of blocks from 5th ave, where all the vendors are and it was great to be able to take the stroller and walk down there whenever we wanted to. Now the cons: - Check-in: Took forever to check in...at least 30 min, mainly because there was only 1 person checking people in for the first 15 min. Then, there was a guy ranting and raving about being next to the construction site, which our seat was the furthest way from the site. The lobby is not air conditioned, so it was hot and humid...be prepared to sweat and wait. - Room: The minibar wasn't stocked when we got there, but, after the brought the crib, a guy came back with all the drinks and stocked it up (after being in the room for about 3 hours). - Location: It is at the end of Main Street, and it's a public beach. Therefore, lots of locals that come and watch and enjoy the beach, as well as watching you. It's good that it's close to 5th street, but, horrible since it's very busy with a bunch of locals making out or watching you. - Beach: There's only about 10 yd that doesn't have any sandbags on them. And it's very rocky once you hit the water. The beach isn't very big at all...the smallest we've been to in Mexico and we've visited several hotels in Cancun, Playa and Cozumel. The best beach is still in Barcelo Maya Hotel in PDR. Lots of seaweeds too. - Pool: Very small pool and they play the towel game here. For those of you that are not aware of the towel game, it's where you come down first thing in the morning with your beach towels and put it on the pool chairs to \"reserve\" it then leave....no telling when you come back, but, you'd have a chair for you. Horrible...we didn't like that at all, as we saw numerous people doing it. They just don't have enough chairs by the pool. So, we hung out in the beach instead, where there's plenty of chairs. The pool water was also warm, whereas the ocean is much nicer (cooler). - Restaurants: With a 14 month old, we didn't want to subject him, us and everyone else around us to a screaming child waiting for food, so we never did the ala carte. We heard that it wasn't that great anyways. And it looked like the italian restaurant was the only air conditioned one. Marias is at the street side so if you get a table by the street, everyone gets to watch you eat. The buffet was super hot...no AC.. if you go, go to the very back of the restaurant where at least the breeze goes to. The food was not great for a buffett. The Barcelo Hotel in PDR was much better. There were quite a few Spanish people, some from cuba there and they seemed to know most of the foods they were serving in the buffett. For us, it wasn't great. Breakfast was about the best buffett. That's it .. hope you enjoyed the review. Would we go back to this hotel? Nope, not unless it was a free trip. We just got lucky in our suite...if it wasn't for our super suite (location, size, etc), we would not be happy at all in this hotel.", "Date": "July 5, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "4", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Cleveland, Georgia", "Title": "\u201cGreat Vacation\u201d", "Author": "MKay48", "ReviewID": "UR5414129", "Content": "My husband and I just returned from the Playa Del Carmen last night. We visited the G P R from Jun 22-29. Overall we had a great time. We are in our late 40's. My review may be long, but the many reviews I read before my trip were helpful to me. Hope this will help you in planning your vacation and making a resort selection. Our family has taken cruises and traveled in Europe and other locations. We honeymooned at Sandal's, in Montego Bay, Jamaca. A few years ago we stayed in Cancun, at the Beach Palace, with our teenage sons. Last year, the four of us selected the Domincan Republic. Over all, Playa Del Carmen is one of our favorite locations. This trip was for just the 2 of us. The boys would have enjoyed this location also. We flew in on a direct flight from Atlanta. We upgraded to the first class section of our Vacation Express Flight, as my husband is 6'5 and enjoyed the extra leg room. Along with this section you are served a sandwich or a salad and unlimited drinks are included. Upon arrival at the G P R check in was very easy. Our Jr. Suite was ready for us. It was located on the 2nd floor facing the street and Royal Real property next door. Although a beach view is nice, the street location was entertaining also. The room was always kept clean. The mini fridge was always stocked. Bottled water was always available as it is suggested that you not brush your teeth with the tap water. This is how our trip to the Dominican Republic was also. In Cancun the hotel water was purified. One complaint I have is that the shower pressure was low and the water was very hot one miniute and very cold the next. My second issue was that the construction was on the same end as our room, #287. Each morning hammering and saws did wake me up. A positive to this was that I got up early each day and enjoyed a much longer day at the pool and the beach. A third problem was our neighbor snored so loud the first 4 nights that it kept us awake. I would like to note that we did not complain to the hotel about any of the above issues. We enjoyed our stay even with these little inconveniences. The food in the hotel was very good. For an all inclusive we thought it rated very high. No reservations were required for either of the specialty locations. We enjoyed both of these choices in addition to the daily hotel buffet selections. Pablo, our waiter at the pool was very personable and always near by when you needed anything. Each day I enjoyed the nachos at the pool grill. Hotdogs and hambergers were also served out there. We used room service about 3 times. Having breakfast delivered to our room was a special treat. This service is available 24 hours a day. Made to order omlets and great pancakes were some of my favorites at the buffet each morning. Enjoy eating and being waited on, worry about your weight when you get home! It did not seem to matter if the men wore long or short pants for the evening meals. We had been told they must wear long pants but there was never an issue about this. There was a very relaxed dress code in this resort. I did not even observe any topless ladies. My husband saw a couple on the beach, he said. I noticed topless ladies in Cancun as well as in the Dominican Republic. Over all the service was great. The room was kept clean, we did not get any towel art, and we only left a tip one day. Tips are nice and if someone gave us special service I was happy to give a tip. The entire resort staff provided us with great service. The lobby bar staff was always friendly and willing to fix whatever we asked for. The pool staff kept the drinks coming. The entertainment staff worked hard to keep the guests who wanted to be entertained busy. Be sure to check out the swing bar,down to the left, on the beach and go up to the 3rd floor pool if you want a little quiet time in the sun. Walk down past the lobby to serve your self a drink or grab finger foods late at nignt or between meal times. The resort location was excellent if you enjoy being in walking distance to shopping. Walmart was a long walk from the hotel. We took a taxi to Akumal for a day trip, it cost about $20 US one way. We were dropped off at the dive shop on the public beach. There were a couple of places to eat and a few little shops in this area. We enjoy visiting Akumal on Sunday when the locals go to the beach. We took another day trip to Cozumel. It is serveral blocks to walk to the peir to catch the ferry. If you prefer a cab it will cost about $3 US to ride to the peir each way. The resort is very convenient to many other locations for day trips and exploring the area. One last tip. JUST SAY NO! Yes the time share people are around. One tricked us by saying they were one of the guest relations staff and wanted to tell us about the hotel and area. We were signed up for a 90 minute presentation accross the street. We did not show up and no one called or bothered us about it later. We talked with one couple who did attend the presentation. They were given a few gifts for attending (bottles of booze and a beach bag) after they insisted on collecting the items promised. Also beware of the street venders on 5th Av. and around the area. Once again Just Say NO! and keep walking if you do not want to shop in their location. We enjoyed all 7 days of our vacation and would return to the Gran Porto Real.

Very good. The rooms are luxurious with marble tile, columns everywhere, large bathroom & shower. Even a phone in bathroom. Our travel agent upgraded us to a Jr. suite oceanview so expected to maybe be able to see the beach from our balcony. Wow, we were oceanfront & could even lay in bed & view the turquoise water. Ate at all their restaurants which were all very good. Mostly used the buffet since it was convenient & had specially made omelet every morning as we ate facing the pool & water. Spent most of our time at the little outside swing bar at the far end of the hotel beach & loved Sergio the bartender. We wanted to take him home! The beach was very nice, but there are some sandbags at the far end and the little fishing boats at the other end. My husband chartered one of the boats for 4 hrs. of fishing, but only got 1 bite.

My new wife and I just returned from our honeymoon in Mexico where we stayed in the Gran Porto Real. We didn't want to come home! We had a junior oceanview suite and the view was spectacular! 98% of our trip was awesome! There were a few hangups. the bad side is, we are picky eaters. The restraunts were alright but not incredible. We never went hungry or anything, there just wasn't anything that we had that was \"jaw dropping\". The shower was nice and big but the water temperature changed drastically from one second to the next. On sunburned shoulders the water seemed to be 300 degrees and the next second you were standing in 30 degree water. The pool on the beach was great. While my new wife can lay out all day and be content, i am a busy body and must be moving. The guys who planned and executed activities were amazing! They could remember just about everyone's name and where they were from after being told just one time! They were very active in getting everyone involved. While our maid did keep our room very tidy, we were a little disappointed that we didn't get any of the towel art on our bed. I even left tips and nothing was ever there. I made one phone call to the front desk and within 10 minutes a lady was making swans out of towels on our bed! All the service was great. Very fast and friendly. I was kind of worried about the construction but we never heard anything in room 343. If you go to the pool on the roof it is much more calm but you can hear the construction from there. We weren't too fond of 5th ave. While it did display alot of the spanish culture, you definatley had to keep both eyes open and watch your pockets. Vendors would constantly try to urge you into their stores and cut you off even to get you to come in. This wasn't too big of a deal, just look straight ahead and keep walking.

We paid for a Jr. suite in the all-inclusive plan. The room had a view of Consitutes Avenue and if you turned your head directly to the right you could see the ocean about 200 yards away. The room was very spacious and looked exactly like the pictures I had seen on this site. I was extremely worried upon check-in after reading all the negative reviews about overbooking and not receving the room you paid for. Once we opened the door to our room I was pleasantly surpised. Room is very spacious and has a very spacious shower. So far things were going very smoothly. I was starting to relax and decided to take a shower after the long day of travel. What I experienced was a shower that exploded and was spraying me with scolding hot water. The lever in which you pull up had broken off and water was going everywhere. To my delight within 15 minutes of contacting the front desk someone came to look at the shower. He left for 10 minutes and showed back up with a new spout and did fix the shower. My girlfriend and I enjoyed the room a great deal until about our 5th night into our vacation. She started to smell some sort of chemical coming through the vent and at first I disregaded it. Then a few hours later I started to smell something and we both tried to just live with it. Each day the smell seemed to be getting worse and finally on our last day we couldn't take it anymore. We found out that the smell was coming directly above us in room 306. They were painting the entire room. After complaining numerous times they finally sent someone to our room after about an hour and a half of complaining. They brought in a deodorizer and said that would take care of it. We went back down to the beach giving it a try and when we arrived back to our room about 4 hours later the smell was worse. We demanded another room and finally got moved to another Jr. Suite but with double beds. After realizing what we were smelling for the last couple nights I was upset but I had to remember that I was in Mexico. Alright enough about the bad news! The Gran Porto Real has a great Location! It is only 2 blocks from 5th Avenue which is where you definitely need to go. It has everything from shopping to great restaurants to nightlife where you can party all night long. I highly recommend the restaurant La Adela which is on 5th Ave. It is authentic mexican food which was wonderful. The beach at Gran Porto Real is really small and the water does have a lot of rocks. Next door at the Royal Porto has a much better beach to swim in. Overall I enjoyed my stay at Gran Porto Real except for the food. I highly recommend that if anyone has a sensitive stomach to stay away from most things at the Buffet called Albatros. The buffet is an open -air restaurant where everything sits out for some time. The cheeses and meats are very questionable because you are sitting in an 80 degree or more environment. The other two restaurants are Maria's and I believe Il Pescadore. They are a Mexican and Italian Restaurant. I enjoyed both places but for some reason the food didn't agree with me. I had horrible somach pains the entire trip but fought through and enjoyed our stay. Try eating out if you get the all inclusive because the food on 5th avenue was extremely good. I really enjoyed the all inclusive drinks at the Gran Porto Real. Say hello to Evanisto on the beach. He was great and $1 tips go along way. I noticed that I tipped more frequently then most people. You need to realize they don't make a lot and what's a few more dollars when you are on vacation. Overall I would stay again at this resort but not sure I would get the all-inclusive. There are so many choices just a couple blocks away. Having a drink anytime was nice but not sure it was worth the extra money. I think next time I go to Playa Del Carmen I will stay next Door at the Royal Porto Real. Playa Del Carmen was very nice and it was very relaxing . There were a few problems along the way and yes some stomach pain. (Watch out for room service.) I had to pray to the porcelain gods my second night thanks to the chicken fried tacos. After re-evaluating my experience I would go back and just bring some more antacids. It was a very memorable experience. Its what you make it. Have fun! The service was outstanding except for a couple people at the front desk. I wish they had more choices of beer only had Dos Equis Lager. No need for reservations of any kind at the restaurants. Never needed to wait and the waiters were always on top of things. If you speak spanish that is a plus. If you are looking for a hotel where you can relax on the beach have a few cocktails and never need to take a taxi this is the spot. We stayed in or around the hotel our entire stay except for going to Cozumel and taking the Jungle Tour through Aqua World.

We ate mostly at the buffet because it was so easy and close but they had such a wide range of food, drinks etc. that there was always something delicious! We ate at Maria's once and at Ilpescatori once and they were both wonderful as well!!! The local people in Playa Del Carmen are truly sweet people who are eager to please you and treat you like royalty!

Otherwise, it was all perfect! Right on the beach, two blocks from all the shops and within walking distance to the ever important Wal-mart!! If you get a chance to go to Walmart, it was interesting to see the different types of items that they have in Mexico and the difference in the way things are sold. The beach here is gorgeous! We snorkled at this beach and saw parrot fish, box fish, lobsters, rays etc!!! The drinks are great, especially the ones that Fillipe makes at the 3rd story pool! whew!!! They also have great nightly entertainment with a different show everynight. We had swans made out of towels with flowers sprinkled over them in our room, chocolates left by the maids as well! Please remember to tip these people, maids, waiters etc!! They work hard for you and always treated us wonderful! I would recomend this place and will be back to stay again. The crowd here seemed to be a fun crowd but more mature than your typical teenage/college kids. There were also families with children here and they all seemed to have a good time. (FYI -for parents, the beaches here all have some women that go topless, although it was few and far between at this location) Also, you are within walking distance to the Ferri to Cozumel and I must recomend doing this! There was live entertainment on one of our ferries and when you get to Cozumel, rent a scooter! For $25 for the whole day it is worth it, ride around the island. It was interesting to see the other side of cozumel, it was different types of shores and waters. We also did the all day excursion to Xel-ha (pronounced \"shellha\") which was so much fun and for once price it included admission, snorkeling gear, drinks, food, snacks, and they will give you each a pack of their sunblock so don't pay $17 for a bottle.

There are sandbags and fishing boats, but if you walk alittle further down, it's fine. There were lots of lounge chairs for sunbathing as well. I thought the night entertainment wasn't too bad.

We went with a group of family & friends for a two week holiday and most importantly for a wedding and I can't express strongly enough how fabulous it was. After a long day of travelling (airport was a nightmare and then a 45 minute bus drive) we finally arrived at the Grand Porto Real. Due to the huge amount of people all trying to book in at the same time there were a few problems but it was made less painfull with the constant supply of champagne that was offered to us in line waiting. It all went UP hill from there. The hotel is beautiful, the food is very good (Maria's is not our groups favorite, no one really liked the menu) but do try the Italian restaurant, it's fabulous and the chocolate mousse is a MUST. The 24 hour V.I.P room was really nice to have (booze/snacks/games/tv) for those times when we pulled an almost all nighter. Staff is very helpful & friendy. Our favorites were Mary & Jesus (bartenders) and Spike (entertainment) they were fun, personable and very good at their jobs. Must warn that the standard rooms are extremely small. Only the very young in the group didn't mind. You would have to be traveling light with no plans to spend any length of time in the room except to shower & sleep. Most of our group had the junior suites and about 12 of us were lucky enough to have the master suites with showers large enough for 15 people. All of the All Inclusive guests get one room service free per day. Was very nice to have breakfast delivered and eaten on the balcony or a late night club sandwich. The Spa has some free things such as wet sauna, dry sauna, whirlpool and cold water dip. The gym is pretty good, the free sailing & kayaking is fun and the aquacise, water volley ball etc are great. There is afternoon Bingo around the pool and beach massages and a roof top hottub, a 3rd floor pool as well as the main pool, nightly entertainment (they aren't that great) and all this before you even hit the famous 5th Ave. Fabulous cafe's, shopping, bars, etc., all lit up and exciting at night and a little cooler. Can't imagine walking the strip during the afternoon heat. We also took in a couple of the day excusions (well worth it) and took the ferry over to Cozamel where we rented scooters and toured the whole island. All in all we had a fabulous two weeks and would definately go back. I don't understand the compaints, these must be VERY VERY picky people, or the resort has done a complete turn around.

The Gran Porto Real property is lovely -colourful, clean, proud, cheery. The staff are exceptionally friendly & attentive. I'm so glad to read the more recent, positive reviews that tell what we found to be true. Nearby 5th Ave. is fun with lots of good humoured invitations to buy, buy, buy! The short walk to a nearby Mega store (Wal-Mart too) was interesting. It's quite hot there at the end of April. Not being a sun worshipper I happily found several pleasant, shady, breezy spots. The construction in the area indicates a prospering economy with work for the local people. Be happy for them. As construction sites go, the noise was not excessive. I found fishing boats at a sea side village to be quite appropriate. Some in our group hired a boat for a morning of fishing - they caught a 6' marlin!

My newlywed husband and I stayed at and got married at the Gran Porto Real the 1st week (Apr 21-Apr 29) The second week we left the group of 60 people that we had came with and stayed at the Barcelo Maya Beach (Apr 30-May 6). We wished we would have stayed at the Gran Porto Real for the whole 2 week duration. The Barcelo was a huge dissapointment after staying at the GPR. (and the barcelo was quite a bit more expensive... go figure?) When we first decided to get married in the mayan riviera we researched MANY hotels on line and after much consideration and reviewing of the rates and locations we finally decided on the GPR. Our travel agent put us in contact with the wedding coordinators Paty & Walter who were amazing to deal with via email. If you are getting married here you will be totally amazed at how easy and smooth everything goes... There is absolutely nothing to worry about, and they take care of every detail. Everything was beyond perfect! Thank you GPR!! Do not believe all the bad reviews... This place was amazing. The only people posting reviews are the people who are not happy with anything in life... or the very few that did have a bad experience unfortunately. I was soo worried before going because I read the reviews each day before the trip. I wasted alot of time worrying about nothing. The Good & The Bad: Hotel: The Location is awesome!!... 5 steps from 5th Ave. The architecture is so amazing... the marbel floors, pillars, the colors, the furniture...everything looks super classy. Check In: We had a group of 63, we all checked in the moment we got off the bus (9 pm) from the airport and were all able to get into our rooms right away. Our group had come with \"Nolitours\" and since \"Nolitours\" only has a block of standard rooms available to them anyone who wanted to upgrade could at the hotel, but at an additonal cost. (tip: you can barter the nightly rate for the upgrade. Front desk charged anything from $30 - $60 american dollars per night to upgrade from standard to jr suite) My fiance and I were automatically upgraded because we were getting married there. Rooms: Standard - nice rooms, 2 beds, smaller bathroom. Nothing wrong with them. But there is construction going on behind all standard rooms (400/500's) and it looks like it will not be done anytime soon. Loud, and it starts at about 7-8am These rooms are also by the swim up bar where it tends to get a little loud in the afternoon. I kinda felt bad for the guests who chose not to upgrade... but then again most were not in there rooms unless they were sleeping. My sister stayed in one and was fine with the construction... Your in Mexico... get out of your room! Jr Suite - very nice rooms, 1 king, or 2 twin, huge bathrooms. Worth the extra money. We stayed in an ocean view. I would highly reccomend spending the few extra dollars... Not anywhere near construction and the balconies and the view of the ocean is worth every penny. Service: Almost everyone who worked there... bartenders, security, animation team, the maids... were exceptionally friendly and accommodating with the exception of front desk (rates and info vary on who is working up there) but still, the service was excellent. Hugo & Spike are so much fun (animation team) Sergio & Timiteo were awesome (bartenders) Eduardo, David & Herio (Servers/Waiters) were catering to everyones needs at all hours of the day and night. Our whole group was impressed at the service at this place. Food: The Hotel buffet was great...no complaints. The Beach buffet was okay... icecream and nacho's were the only thing I would eat at the beach buffet just to be safe. The Italian restaurant was Amazing!! And for the all inclusive plan you can go as many times as you want. I could have ate there every day!! I never got a chance to eat at the mexican restaurant and heard mixed reviews from the rest of the group I was with. It all depends on what you like. You can order room service as many times as you like in a day and it is available 24 hours... Breakfast in bed everyday or a yummy club sandwhich and fries after hitting 5th ave was nice!! Be sure to keep a few dollars on hand for the hard working staff if you do get room service, they carry your food on a tray by hand... no carts! The wedding dinner was truly Amazing... I think it was prepared by the Italian restaurant. Nothing short of Delicious! The staff who worked my reception were outstanding and probably worked a 20 hour shift that day and still were all smiles. Out of a group 63 only a couple people were sick to their tummy's the whole 2 weeks... but I am sure it was more the excessive alcohol, suntanning and the different kinds of ethnic foods moreso than the water or food itself. Dont drink the water... but I brushed my teeth with the sink water the whole 2 weeks in Mexico and was fine. Spa: Make sure to visit the Spa while you are there. My mother loved it! Massages were extra $ but well worth it. 24 hour All inclusive Room: Go pour your own drink... beer, hard liqour, coffee or wine... it's all there. Ping pong and pool. Maid Service: Hotel was kept very clean at all times. If you left a dollar or two you would get towel art. Drinks were replenished each day, or if you drank more of something you could call at anytime of the day and someone would be right up to your room with whatever you requested. Main Pool: Tempurature was just right... the size was okay, but because the hotel was full it was kind of hard to get lounge chair beside eachother if you were with a group of more than 2-3 The waiters & waitresses were constantly making the rounds to keep everyone hydrated! 3rd Floor Pool/Swim Up Bar: Great place to sit and have a few drinks in the afternoon. Smaller in size...Bartender who worked at the swimup was sooo friendly and refilled your drink without asking. Beach: Yes, there were a couple boats on one side of the beach. Did not bother us one bit. Walk over to the swing bar closer to the pier and the beach is bigger and the water is nicer to swim in. We had our ceremony and reception on the beautiful beach. My pictures are so pretty with the white sand and blue/green ocean. Wedding: Picture perfect!! The best day ever... worth the money and was less expensive than doing it at home in Calgary. We did not lift a finger with any preperations. You tell them what you want after reviewing the options available before going down there. Correspond with the hotel via email. Then once we got there 3 days later at 9:30am we had a 1/2 hour meeting with the ceremony coordinator, a 1/2 hour meeting with the reception coordinator got a blood test from a local doctor in the hotel and then just had to show up at the time of the ceremony on your wedding day.. Travis & I were blown away with the services, the set up, everything... it was beyond anything I had pictured in my mind. Thank you GPR!! Hopefully this helps anyone who is worried....

If you are looking to hit the clubs, they will definatley take you, just meet up in the front lobby. For a good time I would recommend The Blue Parrot and Bally's.

They do this great little show where they light the liquor on fire before pouring it into the coffee... Very nice! Only 2 negative things to say about the GPR: (1) The beach is on the small side but we didn't mind since we mostly hung out at the pool all day! If you really want to do the beach, a 5 min. walk to the left (in front of the Royal) the water & beach there is awesome!! (2) The entertainement wasn't very good & no disco at the resort so by 11:00 it's really quiet, if you wanna party though, it's just a 5 min. walk to 5th Avenue...

We have travelled to a lot of different resorts in the Caribbean and other places and were very pleased with the facilities, food and service levels at the Gran Porto Real. We were checked in promptly by very courteous front desk staff. Our room was perfect - #152 (Junior Suite) that faced the pier, beach and the restaurant at Royal Porto Real. Our patio was perfect for watching the sunrise several mornings. The room was very large and extremely clean. The bathroom was also a great size, although lighting was somewhat dim. The large shower was a nice bonus and the water pressure fabulous! Satellite TV was a nice touch too - especially since there were a couple of local Canadian channels available! Staff kept our mini-bar well stocked with water, beer and pop the whole week! The Mexican and Italian restaurants do NOT require reservations anymore - it's first come first serve and we alternated evenings between the 2 restaurants without any reservations or having to wait in line to get in. We did not eat dinner at the buffet restaurant at all during the week, but did have breakfasts and several lunches there - breakfasts were great and lunch was pretty good. We really enjoyed both the Mexican and Italian restaurants for dinner - great service by Ivan at Maria's (Mexican). I highly recommend the \"Beef Tips Mexican Style\" and the \"Tex Mex Fajitas\" there and the Caesar Salad and \"Block of Grouper\" or \"Chicken Parmigiana\" at the Italian restaurant. The 24-hour room service was a great benefit too, especially if you plan to do an all-day excursion that leaves before the restaurant opens in the morning. Watch out for Franklin or any of the other sales people who work for the Real \"Gold\" Club - they're located in the main lobby of the hotel - they will try to sell you on spending 90 minutes across the street at the Royal Porto Real listening to a spiel on their \"vacation club\" (ie: a time share) - they will offer free breakfast and a tour of the resort (which is more upscale than the Gran Porto Real). We refused this offer as we did not want to waste 90 minutes of our precious vacation time! You will also receive offers to \"upgrade\" to the Royal Porto Real at a small \"surcharge\" - we did not even consider this as we were very happy with our room and the facilities at Gran Porto Real! The beach is good, although it has receeded due to hurricane damage. The palapas are wonderful and selection is good early in the morning. Evaristo and Mary are very attentive beach waiters who will bring you drinks all day long with big smiles on their faces! We didn't enjoy the beach-level pool that much as there were constant activities going on with loud voices pumped over a microphone - it was hard to have a swim without getting hit with a volleyball or splashed by people playing games in the pool. The 3rd floor pool was very nice in the late afternoon - nice to sit at the swim up bar and relax after a hot day! Not a lot of shade there earlier in the day though. A HUGE benefit of the Gran Porto Real is its location - right on the beach and only 2 blocks from 5th Avenue, which is a great spot to buy jewelry, souvenirs, clothing etc. There are some great restaurants and bars along the street too - it has a cool ambience! The vendors and restaurant owners are a bit pushy, but don't let this turn you off - some great deals can be found here! Negotiate at least half price on any prices they give you. Most vendors are willing to deal, but some may be rude and refuse to negotiate - don't worry, because you'll find the same things (or better) in another store! We would definitely recommend this resort to our friends and family!", "Date": "April 23, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Dallas, TX", "Title": "\u201cWonderful Resort...Ignore the bad reviews!\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR4988196", "Content": "Let me first start out by saying I am a hotel review junkie...meaning, that before I go somewhere I read as many reviews as I can possibly find about the place - good and bad. This is my first time to actually write a review myself though. With that being said, let me share our experience with you! My husband and I went to Gran Porto Real for our honeymoon April 4-8, 2006. We decided to go there based on the good reviews, in spite of the bad ones we had read. We arrived at the hotel prepared for the \"unfriendly staff,\" \"bad food,\" \"weak drinks\" etc etc that we read about. Well let me just say NONE of that was true! We had the most wonderful experience! We were greeted at the hotel with friendly faces and a glass of champagne. We had arrived earlier than check in time, so knew our room wouldn't be ready yet (our fault, not theirs). We wanted to get there as soon as possible, knowing we could walk around and check things out in the meantime. The front desk was very friendly, and asked us to stop back by around 3pm. We chose to go check out the inside bar and have a few drinks. At 3:05pm we went back to front desk and our room was ready ON TIME. We had no problems with the hotel being \"overbooked\" as I had read in some reviews. Nor did I hear of anyone around us having any trouble either. We went to our room and it was perfect. Exactly what we had asked for! Junior Suite with an ocean view, meaning our balcony faced the ocean...beautiful. During our stay, we decided to just enjoy the hotel and the amenities there. The service was excellent! We never had to wait for a drink, and as a side note, our drinks were never \u2018weak\u2019. The food was good. We never checked out the Italian or Mexican restaurant, but the poolside food and the buffet food were just fine with us. We had NO complaints. Definitely try the guacamole at the poolside snack bar - it was excellent! The property itself is beautiful...very clean! And maybe it was where our room was located (right outside the pool area), but we never heard any type of construction noises. Now the reviews about all the boats on the shore are true, but it didn\u2019t hinder our good time in any way. You can still get in the water, and if you aren\u2019t happy with the beach area in front of the Gran Porto Real, then just walk several yards down the beach and it\u2019s great. No hassle at all. If you are looking to go to this resort, but are scared of the bad reviews you read, DON\u2019T BE! We found none of them to be true. I\u2019m not really sure what the travelers who wrote the bad reviews were expecting, but seems to me those are just people who would complain for the sake of complaining. GO THERE. HAVE FUN!

Well, the Gran Porto was recommended to us as being a great hotel, in a great location with good restaurants and beaches. We were looking forward to a well deserved week\u2019s vacation. Unfortunately, it was everything but! I\u2019ll try to keep it to the point. I have added this one to one of the bad ones. The Good: \u00b7Hotel staff (excluding front desk) were very cordial and quite accommodating \u00b7Staff working in the restaurant very pleasant and would go out of the way to provide you with excellent service. \u00b7THAT\u2019s IT! Restaurants: -Three days prior to our departure we were informed that three restaurants at the hotel had closed. -Buffet restaurant was ok for breakfast and lunch. Don\u2019t bother for supper \u2013 not very good -Reservations for both Mexican and Italian restaurants extremely hard to obtain, would recommend you book upon your arrival but don\u2019t expect to obtain early sittings. -Small \u201ctake-out\u201d type of restaurant on the beach serves that serves hotdogs/hamburgers/fast food was ok. Accommodations: -Did not get room we had reserved (jr suite with two beds). Were given jr suite with king size bed -Roll out provided but was in very bad condition -Room door did not lock, toilet did not work. Housekeeping was called (they arrived promptly) and repaired the toilet but unable to repair door \u2013 we concocted something to ensure that the door would not open that night -Bathroom not clean, and well for the beds - lets not go there. -Room located next to road where buses load and unload guests to hotel but it was better that other rooms located in the \u201cconstruction\u201d zone (construction started about 7:00 a.m. and ended about 8:00 p.m.) -Obtained the following afternoon a Jr. Suite with two beds (but had to make a bit of a fuss at the front desk in order to obtain the room we had booked. This is not my style to operate this way but even being nice for over an hour didn't work! the front desk were not very accommodating. But then again we were not the only ones complaining!!) -Both rooms had a very strong musty-damp smell. Vacation during March Break: -Given that it was spring break we had expected that spring breakers would be at hotel but the hotel was not ready for them! Hotel should have had much more security overseeing (or should I say babysitting) the breakers. -Many items broken, vomited upon all hours of the day and night. -Many unsupervised teenagers yelling/swearing/screaming at all hours of day and night but mostly night! and unfortunately for us right next door to our room (yes the room we were transferred to). I felt sorry for the families that were staying at the hotel with young children \u2013 not a pretty sight for them to see. Beach: -Not much of a beach at this hotel. Unfortunately last fall\u2019s hurricane took care of that. The hotel is trying to save what little is left by placing huge sandbags alongside the shoreline but to no avail. The beach on the right hand side of the hotel was full of seaweed and lined up with boats (approx 10 of them when we were there) that took up the remaining portion. Misc.: Watch out for the vendors trying to sell timeshares in the hotel lobby. They are just waiting for your arrival! Location: Just a block away from 5th avenue, the hotel\u2019s location is good if you are looking for shops (watch for a few tourist trap type of stores), good restaurants, good bars. One word of caution. Don\u2019t go when the cruise ships arrive in Playa del Carmen (Wednesday/Thursdays). You won\u2019t be able to walk down the street! Our third day and remainder of our vacation went very well - we transferred to the Royal Porto next door! (great hotel) \u2013 would recommend this one over the other hands-down.

I was SO worried that I made a bad choice and my husband was ready to strangle me for reading all the bad reviews, but everything turned out fine. It is a very clean hotel, the food was good and there was LOTS of it, the staff was very friendly and helpful and it was fun being close to 5th avenue. My only two complaints are that it was a little noisy late at night when the spring breakers were coming up to their rooms and that the beach isn't very nice. But the beaches in either direction are good, so you don't have to go far to swim. We ate at each place twice. We made reservations as soon as we got there. The front desk said we couldn't make reservations for the week, but the consierge said we could. If you are traveling with young children here are a few things you might want to know: The hotel has one stroller which we were lucky enough to get. I didn't think my pre-schooler would need one, but 5th Ave. is long for a tired, hot 5 year old. And we took it with us to Xcaret too. By the swing bar they have sand pails and shovels, etc. for the kids to play with, but get there before 5:00 because that's when they close. There's only one hot-tub and it's in the spa. Children are not allowed in it. Our shower had a two foot high tile basin. If you brought a rubber drain cover, you could probably give your kids a bath. (The drains don't plug, because it's supposed to be a shower only.) Don't turn your towels in at the end of the day, because you'll want them early the next morning to stake out your chairs by the pool. If you don't get any chairs, don't worry, people come and go during the day, so eventually you'll get some. 5th Avenue was fun to walk down, but it got really crowded at night. Early morning was a nice time to take a stroll or a jog. There is a lovely, little treasure of a store just off of 5th, called LUNAE. From the hotel, turn right onto 5th and then right again at the first side street (by Senor Frog's CLOTHING store.) Everything is hand made by the store owner. It's cool and funky and her prices are very reasonable - also she doesn't pressure you at all! Bring lots of ones to tip your servers and housekeepers. They work really hard and I think it's appreciated. The housekeepers for our room were nice. When I told them my 5 year old was tired and cranky, they folded the towel up like a swan and told her it was for her so she wouldn't cry. She loved it. We really did have a great time. There's always a few bumps on any vacation and you just have to deal with problems, but overall we loved our trip. My kids had tons of fun in the pool and on the scruffy beach. They only went to kid's club once and that was to play on the swing set while we packed. But the girls who work there are very sweet and it looked like they had a lot of activities. We probably wouldn't go back to the Gran Porto, just because we don't take a lot of vacations, so when we do we'll go somewhere different.

The food was excellent considering it was buffet. None of our party ever got sick. Our room was #403, a standard room facing the street. It was always cleaned by the time we returned from the pool.

The pool-a little cold but that sun makes you sooo hot the water cools you right off. We were always able to get 6 lounge chairs together-we put our towels on them around 7:00 each morn..no problems.

The staff were excellent, very caring,lots of great craft ideas - a wonderful place to get the kids some relief from the sun-highly recommend it!!!

If you like diversity and not a sterile US hotel plopped in the middle of nowhere, then this is not for you. If you want a bit more culture and access to a festive and fun town, it is for you. Don't go if you are looking for gourmet food. In fact, don't go to any all-inclusive if fine dining is your goal. However, while this was not fine dining, it was quite good. There was plenty of variety and it was really pretty tasty! The breakfast was outstanding, the lunch options very good. We liked the snack bar and enjoyed the hot dogs, chili, and chips and salsa. Dinner was quite nice. The Mexican place was not very good but mainly because the service was pretty bad. The Italian place was very good. We celebrated our anniversary there and the staff was excellent. It was relaxed and quiet out on the patio. Make sure to make reservations as soon as you check in. We would have liked to eaten there twice. If you want a change of pace, 5th Avenue is full of really nice places to eat and drink. We were just happy to veg out and not worry about making reservations elsewhere. That is one reason we like all inclusives. Our room was great although we weren't thrilled when we first checked in since it was a junior suite, ocean view. That means that we were on the street side but we were up close to the beach so our view was spectacular. In fact, we decide not to switch when we had the opportunity because we loved watching the action on the street. It was particulary fun on Sunday when the beaches were filled with the locals having family get togethers. It was so nice to be reminded that people are the same all over the world. The facilty was very nice and warm but what made it awesome was the staff. If you want great beach service, find Jesus. He is one of the hardest working guys around. We were never thirsty when sitting on the beach because he waited on us hand and foot. In fact, he would bring us our drinks first thing without even asking if we wanted one! At the pool bar, Miriam was outstanding. She put up with a few wild spring breakers and always had a smile and a cold beverage. The best waiter in the morning was Mel. In fact, we called him maestro as he very willingly helped us with our attempt at speaking Spanish. Juan Carlos was helpful with information about the hotel and another Juan Carlos was a friendly and outgoing host for the buffet.

Do not, under any circumstances, book a standard room. We did--big mistake. The construction starts at 5-5:30am, and often doesn't stop til after 10pm. And it's loud. And it affects ALL standard rooms. The entire wing is right next to this. Don't think you can sleep through it. We're talking jackhammers, dragging about of iron bars, hammering of metal all day long. It is 8 feet from your window, and it grates on your nerves. #2. Never, ever stay here during spring break. Even if your travel agent says this isn't a student destination. One of my party is a teacher and we had to deal with about 40 screaming, vomiting, drunk and obnoxious teenagers all week long. I mean screaming obsceniies and vomiting right outside your room at 4am. (And don't forget the construction starts at 5, good luck with that half hour/hour of sleep!)

Expect at least 3 things to be broken, up to and including the bathroom lights, the sink, and the lock on your door. Have fun! #4. The front desk staff is a nightmare. They don't care about you, the customer is always wrong, and god help you if you have any problems, because the front desk sure won't. #5.

Stayed at the Gran Porto Real. Had a great time. There were 22 of us in our group (five families). We were there for Spring Break. I've read a lot of negative reviews about the place, but we had a great time. Everyone got the rooms they wanted (type and view). The only issue at registration was that one family got stuck on the first floor and we had asked for everyone to be on the second or third floors. After a short discussion, the hotel moved them to the third floor. The positives: great location right by Fifth Avenue which has all the shopping and restaurants; very nice pool and daily activities; our rooms were nice and the staff was courteous and prompt (for the most part); the food was fine--what do you expect from a buffet; we ate at the Italian restaurant two nights and the food was good; some of the couples at at the Mexican restaurant and it was good as well; I thought the fajitas at the buffet restaraunt were great. The negatives: hey, it's MEXICO; get ready for it; no one gets in a big hurry down there; the service is typically slower than equivalent resorts in the States; don't be surprised when you ask the concierge to book a reservation for you at a restaurant and she claims that she hasn't heard of the restaurant (it's only three blocks away) and she doesn't have the phone number; or when you're looking for a sports bar to watch a college basketball game and you ask a guy who works at a clothing store \"where is Sports Bar '77\" and he says he says \"no sey\" and it's actually directly across the street from his store; like I said, \"hey, it's MEXICO\"; the beach at the resort was not really nice, but you can walk around the corner to the beach in front of the Royal Porto Real and it's really nice--great boogie boarding. Suggestions: DO: play beach volleyball with Oscar at the volleyball court at the end of the resort by the ocean; boogie board on the beach in front of the Royal Porto Real; take nice walks down 5th Avenue either early morning (before it gets too warm) or early evening (before it gets rowdy); take part in the pool activities; relax and enjoy it; if you like golf, play the course at Playacar, but be sure to bring plenty of golf balls (I'm a 14 handicapper and lost several balls--not much rough, just jungle). DON'T: expect too much from the buffets (the food is pretty basic but it was pretty good as well); be confused about the difference between \"ocean front\" and \"ocean view\" (\"ocean front\" means you're facing the pool with a view of the ocean; \"ocean view\" means your facing the road/other hotel and can see the ocean from the edge of your balcony); expect too much in the form of speedy service (they are on beach time, so get used to it) I think a lot of the negative reviews about this place deal with either (a) people who aren't prepared for the slower pace of service you experience in Mexico; (b) who didn't realize the difference between the ocean front and ocean view; or (c) who didn't communicate with the hotel directly to make sure they were getting what room and type of room they wanted.

As a result we phoned one week in advance to confirm our booking, then once again called the day of our flight before we flew off. Both times we were reassured they had a room for us. We were still quite concerned as we weren't arriving to the hotel until 1am. When we arrived at the airport, we saw our Nolitours person directing us to our bus, a man took our luggage out of our hands and carried it a few feet and expected a tip\u2026.we weren\u2019t quite ready for that! A little bit of an initiation to a new culture. We noticed more \u201cseasoned\u201d travelers just held onto their luggage and refused help! We arrived, were promptly given room 508, a bell boy helped us with our luggage and we took a quick look around the hotel. The room was clean and comfortable. The bed and pillows were perfectly comfortable. The fridge was stocked with lots of beverages (a little freezer box area in the fridge). There was a building being constructed right outside our window, but the noise and sight never bothered us any. We tended to wake up bright and early so we weren\u2019t bothered by early morning construction noise. It was quite quiet at our end of the building. We weren\u2019t bothered by much noise at all. We brought along earplugs just in case of any issues in this regard, but didn\u2019t even need them. The bathroom was quite adequate. Fresh towels were available each day. The maid created a few neat \u201ccreations\u201d out of towels for us which brought a smile to our faces (we tipped the maid $2 CDN a day following our Nolitour reps advice). There was plenty of room for clothes storage. Big closet with lots of shelves to place clothing, an ironing board, extra pillow, safety deposit box and room to hang clothing. We were pleasantly surprised to find out we had internet available in our room\u2026. We used that for the first couple days\u2026 However it was a little high priced for the amount we used it--$15 CDN for 3 days (and the 3rd day they were making changes to the system so it stopped working for us). From then on we used the internet in the lobby\u2014three terminals, never busy, quick connection for 1 pessos/minute (10cents/minute). If you ventured into town you can get it for a little cheaper. We bought a phone card before heading down to Mexico. However, it wasn\u2019t valid as they apparently have a different phone system using satellite. So, our advice, would be to purchase a phone card down there or just use the internet. At one point we needed to buy a phone card and ended up spending about $12/CDN to call a 1-800 number to our bank (long story there but won\u2019t go into that\u2014still not sure if the maid stole our bank card, if we dropped it somewhere or if it hiding in our yet unpacked luggage!), and used up the entire card in about 7 minutes!!! Crazy! So, internet was the best mode of communication we found. In regards to food\u2026 The breakfasts were AMAZING! Fresh custom made omelets every morning! Pancakes, French toast, sausage, bacon, cereal, toast, pastries, lots of fresh fruit, yogurt, juices, etc. definitely the BEST meal! We would fill up at breakfast and not even worry about lunch usually. Lunch options were adequate\u2014usual fast food type stuff. In regards to the a la carte restaurants, we followed other\u2019s advice and reserved our dinners on the first day. However, we were a little disappointed with the food at both a la carte restaurants. We preferred the supper buffet personally. Even the atmosphere in the buffet restaurant seemed a little quieter. But it was worth going for the experiece. We did one dinner at the Mexican and one at the Italian restaurant (Italian being our favorite of the two). They certainly have different meal presentation! We preferred buffet because we could take a look at the food available and taste test small portions. FABULOUS service all round at the buffet restaurants and a la carte restaurants. We tipped at the a la carte restaurants only, following our Nolitour rep\u2019s advice. We didn\u2019t participate in activities around the hotel much. We tended to stick to the beach and snorkeling. The beach was definitely not the best for swimming. If you like to lounge around and have shade and drinks available it was perfect\u2026 Even the boats added a nice touch to the scenery. But if you wanted to swim, it was better at the Royal Porto or better yet, further down by Cocoa Bay Resort (the last resort north). We rented a lounger and shade for two days at Mamitas just a couple minutes walk from GPR\u2014only cost us $6 CDN for two loungers and a shade for the entire day. Warning\u2026put sunscreen on even with the shade! We learned that one the hard way! We really enjoyed snorkeling. A man named Jesus was drumming up business on the beach one day and invited us to go snorkeling with him (he has a fishing boat right outside the GPR). So, we inquired at the hospitality desk and also with security if he was to be trusted\u2026.which they said he was. So, we ended up going on a boat with one other tourist. Jesus didn\u2019t end up going on the boat in the end (just does advertising I guess!). A man named Jose and another man took us out about 5-10 minutes away and we did snorkeling for about 1 \u00bd hours for $25 CDN/each\u2026. We LOVED it! Definitely the highlight of our week! The guide would dive down and nudge the fish, got a sting ray out of hiding, brought a star fish to the surface for me to hold, picked up a crab for us to see up close, found us a neat sea shell etc. It was just great. Definitely worth it. The next day we went to Cocoa Bay Resort beach and snorkeled. It was awesomeJ Definitely recommend that! Lots of reef right near the shore. We felt very safe. We also went to Xel-Ha and Tulum\u2026.good outings. We attended two evening shows and enjoyed. Shopping on 5th Avenue was an experience in itself! We weren\u2019t quite prepared for the culture shock of that! Lots of people wanting to get your business (time share people on every corner!). So beware! The store owners weren\u2019t as aggressive. And definitely bargain! We didn\u2019t quite master the art of bargaining\u2026just started learning a few of the tricks! Start at 50% and start walking away saying you may come back later and the price WILL come down! We noticed some paint fumes while there, but this didn\u2019t end up being a problem for us. I imagine there would be painting and construction done at most resorts! They want to keep things up! We also noticed some people in the lobby being sent elsewhere due to overbooking\u2026.so definitely recommend calling the hotel in advance for peace of mind. Keep things locked up in the safe! Our particular room didn\u2019t have a sliding lock or dead bolt which we found a little unsettling. However, some rooms appeared to have the sliding locks we found out later. We just created a bit of a barricade for our peace of mind. (although everyone seemed very trustworthy so no concerns founded in that regard). All in all, it was a fantastic week. We loved the look and feel of the GPR. Great archeticture. Very clean, comfortable and homey. More then enough food and drink. Amazing service. We would definitely consider returning to this resort. (FYI people from next door at the Royal Porto who had been at GPR in past years said they preferred GPR\u2026interesting we thought) Fantastic location! Fantastic staff!

They were painting on the second floor and that did leave an odor however I supposed they must do this at some point! The food was just ok. If you want to eat at the 2 alacarte restaurants, book your reservation the day you arrive or you can't get it. But we did notice that even tho we were told they were full, that they were not. So you might want to just go directly to the restaurant and see at the time. However the service was FABULOUS. The waiters on the beach go out of their way to bring you drinks. The hotel is beautiful and the Jr. Suite Oceanview was lovely! I did hear many people arguing at the front desk w/them about room changes, etc. and spoke to others who had difficulties. I would highly recommend calling beforehand to confirm. There are plenty of lounges by the pool and beach area. Never did we not find a lounge. entertainment was second rate but it was amusing at least! Would I return? I don't think so as there are so many other places to go to and I would like a pool that accommodated those with walking problems like I have. There were no steps into the pool, just ladders and a step down with a large drop off. The water was clear and wonderful!

I read reviews about the beach having a few boats off to one side which I thought would be fine but I couldn't believe what I saw.

They were trying to convince us we needed to spend our week in Cancun becuase they were over booked and even the Royal Porto across the street was also overbooked.

After 2+ hours of arguing with the front desk staff, them claiming to get a manager and then saying no manager was available... blah, blah, blah, we finally agreed to spend 1 night in the Real resort in Cancun (another hour's drive away) and return to the Gran Porto the following day.

THERE IS NO BEACH, it is all sandbagged up to your lounge chairs and the water is not blue or green it is black for all of the public boats that are docked in front of the hotel. In Playa del Carmen, the beaches are public, so you have many people walking around the beach area that are not even from your hotel, they may be from cruise ships, from Cozumel or locals. I will be as brief as possible but there is alot to be negative about. Good first: The waiters and waitresses were great, especially Benito on the beach, they kept the drinks coming. The rooms, we had Junior Suites, are very nice and the housekeeping does an excellent job. Lots of activities at the pool and in the lobby bar, you can always find something to do. Okay, the BAD: Food was mediocre at best. We have stayed at many all inclusives before but this one seems to be the worst. The buffet was OK for breakfast and lunch but awful for dinner. You could never make reservations at the other restaurants(Mexican and Italian)they were always full. The restaurants only seat about 100 people. We got there on Sunday the next reservation for Il Pescatore(Italian) was the following Saturday! They need to give the guests another option for food. There was a beach snack bar which had hot dogs and hamburgers but you can only eat them for so many days, same food everyday. Don't bother saving seats by the pool, I got up two mornings at 5 AM to save seats to find both days all stuff was moved onto two chairs, and one morning all the towels I had layed out were gone with new peoples things on the chairs I had saved. There is no beach to walk on or view beacuse of the boats, go next door to the Royal, great beach and no coral. FRONT DESK was AWFUL. They could care less about you or your reservation. Playa Del Carmen is receiving alot of influx of guests from Cancun but it does not mean that the people who have standing reservations should be told they have no rooms.We were told that and we had 14 people in our party. NO Apologies, nothing, just a shrug of the shoulders. The only good thing that came out of the front desk was that we got to stay at the Royal Porto Real next door for one night. That was excellent, pay the extra money and stay there. If we knew the difference we would have. But again, we checked in over there to check out the following morning to check back in the Gran, lots of lugging suitcases and paperwork, all in about 15 hours.

BOTH ALA CARTE restaurants are outdoors. If you go there in July or August it WILL BE HOT. Know what you are getting yourself into before you decide on a hotel. We went in October and the temp was ideal. Don't go blindly and then complain about it afterwards. The bufett was just that, a bufett. What do you expect? Cooked to order steak and lobster from the bufett? There is nothing wrong with it, but if you expect first class service and top notch food from a bufett, get real. Once again, know what you are getting yourself into. The beach side grill was wonderful for lunch and snacks. NO, once again, you will not get lobster or prime rib from the SNACK BAR, but you will get good sandwiches and quesadillas and such. There are 4 places to eat, if you are not happy with a Mexican, Italian, Bufett, and Snack Bar, then go somewhere else. I don't believe all the horror stories about overbooking. If you have problems, call your travel agent. Lets assume you used Travelocity or Expedia. Do you really think they would treat those customers wrong and risk getting delisted? Surely not.

Once again, know what you are getting yourself into. We happened to enjoy the boats, they added much character. If you want a pristine, secluded beach, you might want to think of an isolated hotel in the middle of nowhere. The beach was not a perfect swimming beach, but you can go next door in front of the Royal and find what you are looking for. Again, know what you are getting yourself into. Service - I have never been treated so well at any place before in my life. They will literally do anything to make your stay more enjoyable. Don't be afraid to drop $10-20 a day in tips, that little bit goes a long way, and obviously won't phase someone that just spent $3000 on a vacation. Rooms - We had a junior suite, and it was wonderful. No it was not oceanfront, but you know good and well to get oceanfront, you will have to pay a premium. You won't get it for free. You are in a public city, the Gran Porto management cannot help it if some other private business is constructing something next door. Don't let it ruin your vacation, if you want pristine seclusion, then you will not find it anywhere around 5th Ave in Playa del Carmen. Go somewhere else, don't whine about it afterwards. We will be back soon, most likely to try out the Royal. However, I would not hesitate for a second to go back to the Gran.

People, you MUST consider what is written by myself and other posters about this resort because it definitely has major issues and the hotel management simply chooses to ignore the problem or make empty promises. It is a 2.5 - 3 star at best There is a serious lack of customer service or consideration towards their guests. People pay alot to go on vacation expecting it to be worry free but end up being more stressed than when they were are home! This resort is not worth the money they are asking. Here's why: - Right off the bat when we arrived, they said they were sold out and that we would be staying at the Barcelo for 2 nights and 5 nights at the Royal Porto Real. If you read past postings, the Barcelo is in the middle of nowhere and usually you would get stuck out there and the Royal Porto would be \"sold out\". The Royal Porto is like staying at a Loewes hotel and the Gran Porto is like staying in a Best Western - why would they give you a room there? I saw them turn back 3 buses full of passengers from the airport saying they were sold out and wouldn't let them get off the bus. They told the bus driver to go directly to their Real Cancun hotel (by the way, Cancun is still a huge mess with no beach and smells like raw sewage)! They start off so many people's vacation wrong. After refusing to go, the snarly lady at the font desk threw us in the noisy constuction wing in a crappy, small room with loudm banging noise on one side and traffic noise on the other! When we refused the room, she ignored us completely. We eventually had to pay off a desk clerk on the side to get a decent room on the other end a day later. - They cheaped out on everything - from the food, snacks, booze, toilet paper, room amenities to even the interior design. We had to fight to even get bottled water! - There were a few genuinely nice staff there, which we tipped generously and became friends with - The entertainment was really lousy and the daytime activites by the pool were non-existent - The food was HORRIFIC! The Mexican restaurant was really bad, the Italian restaurant was better, probably the best but stay away from the pizza. They charge all-inclusive guests 14.00USD extra for Lobster that is rubbery and overcooked. The only decent meal was breakfast at the buffet but by other hotel standards, the food was stale and overcooked, the fresh juices were watered down. The VIP room was a joke. - Our room smelt like a big, dirty cigar and the blankets/bedspread were dirty. The beds are lumpy so you woke up with a huge backache. The bathrooms were large with only a shower (no bath) but the water kept alternating from cold to hot so if you burned in the sun, the shower was extremely uncomfortable. - The beach? There is no beach at this hotel. You have to walk 5 minutes either way to use the beach because there are some boats parking directly in front of the hotel. The beach in front of the Royal is nice but dont even try to use one of their chairs or you will be escorted off by security - Room service menu is digusting and they only allow it once a day. Then, when you leave the dishes outside for them to pick up, it takes a day for someone to come by and clear it, even with repeated calls to the front desk. Three rooms on our wings were complaining about the cockroaches in their rooms. - The pools are freezing cold and there is no whirlpool. - Even after we paid off someone to get our room, the management would leave notes under our door saying that we \"won\" the chance to spend the rest of our vacation in Cancun at the Gran Costa Real, which I understand is less desirable than the Gran Porto! It was really insulting and thoughtless on their part to come up with such an obviously lie to compensate for overbooking 85 rooms. By this point, we were just appalled by their dishonestly. The bottom line is that this hotel does not have the hospitality mindset to ensure guests are taken care of, happy and may return the following year. They just don't care! We wont return back to any of the Real hotels. This trip was disappointing as far as the resort goes.

The Gran Porto REal was recommended and we paid $3,600 for two of us for the week. When we arrived we were immediately told that they had overbooked and we could not stay. We were shipped off to a resort 30 minutes farther south and told they would bring us back in two days, however, they would let us stay in their sister resort that was a more expensive resort. We were told we had no alternative. They shipped us off to the Barcelo REsort, which was a nice resort but NOT what we had chosen. We even asked if we could just stay there so that we could unpack and settle in to our vacation. We were told no, that we had to return to the Gran Porto Real. The following day we received a telephone call stating that they had made another error and they would not have room at the upgraded sister resort and that we would come back to the Gran Porto REal but we would receive \"compensation\". On the third day we were told to be waiting with our luggage at noon because they would be picking us up to return us to Play del Carmen. Well noon came and went and no shuttle. My husband finally went to the MLT tour desk and wouldn't leave. Meanwhile we had now spent a couple of hours waiting in the lobby! The MLT rep rented a van and sent us back to the Gran Porto REal. When we arrived only one of the three couples in our group had a room available. The others had to wait. We were told that no one was going to the upgraded sister resort until the following day when they wanted to move us again!!! We finally simply refused to move again...the supposed upgrade was simply not worth having to pack up once more. When we were there this was happening to a lot of people. OUr rep told us that Gran Porto REal is notorious for overbooking. We felt like we lost three days of our seven day stay in Mexico. The staff at the hotel front desk totally didn't give a darn about us, but if they deal with this as often as it appears, then I can see why.

We enjoyed Mexican music during the ceremony and found terrific photo opportunities everywhere around the resort. The private reception was on the beach with a full course meal and dancing afterwards. The resort is very well situated for those who want to be close to shopping, restaurants, bars as it is located right in Playa del Carmen. The Mayan Ruins of Tulum are about 45 minutes away and well worth seeing. The resort is beautiful and if possible, you will enjoy the upgrade to a jr. suite as the regular rooms are very small. The 3rd floor swim up pool is quite nice and not crowded like the large pool on the main level. The beach is nice but small. There are several fishing boats right in front of the resort, but you won't notice these after the first day. There is a lobby bar, a pool bar and a swing bar that serve great tropical drinks. The Mexican restaurant called Maria's is great and the waiters are fun. Have a Mayan coffee, very entertaining to watch them make. The Italian restaurant \"El Pescadore\" is also very good. They serve the best caesar salad there. The resort buffet dining room has lots of variety and they will cook almost anything you ask for. The reception staff were friendly and very helpful. Special thanks to the Reception Manager, Carlos. Our suite was very clean and room service was fast and warm. It was a very good holiday. The only thing that we did not enjoy was the nightly entertainment. The dancers were talented, but the shows are very amateur. Audience participation might have helped guests enjoy the shows more!

OVERALL: The hotel is beautiful and the size is perfect. We thought the food was above average for an all inclusive. The bar service was exceptional. There was always a waiter around serving drinks, even on the beach. (try a mango daiquiri) DRAWBACK: The only drawback (and this was a major one) was the construction behind our secton of the hotel. (near the 4th floor swimup bar Room 418) Every morning (6am) we woke up to the sound of a hammer and one morning a jackhammer. The manager said this was nothing to do with Real Porto and there was nothing he could do about it. If you want to stay at this hotel over the next couple of months make sure you are in the front section towards the ocean and you won't even be aware that there is construction going on. FOOD: Book your al-la carte reservations on your first day and you won't have a problem getting reservations at a reasonable time. The buffet dining room was great and if you really want to you can order room service at no extra charge. ENTERTAINMENT: The fishermen in front of the hotel will take you for a nice day fishing or snorkelling to a secluded spot and they are pretty funny guys.

We are not snobs and do not expect a so called 4 or 5 star in Mexico to be the same as what we have in Canada, but when you are paying so much you expect some value for your money and to be treated with truthful respect. Like so many who have posted, when we finally got to the hotel, we were told our room was not ready. The checked us in so we would have our bracelets, and said they would hold our bags and encouraged us to explore the hotel. MY ADVICE- get your bracelet, get a drink and return the desk and ask for your room. NICELY. Tell them you don\u2019t mind if it isn\u2019t ready, that you want to see it\u2026 Make sure they have a room for you that is what you booked. Yes, we ended up with the constructions view, when we booked ocean view, and our travel agent had requested ocean view and VIP treatment. It took MANY frustrating trips to the front desk and eventually we got moved to a street side room that was close to the ocean. (242 to the ocean end of the building really aren\u2019t bad views, the odd ones have ocean view). It was the fact we were lied to about when a new room was available (come back at 9am, comeback at noon, come back at 3pm) mislead about room availability and had to come back four times to finally get moved really ruined the first few days of our holidays. They whole room issue could have been overcome with some simple gestures on their part-champagne or wine waiting for us in the room, a free scuba or snorkeling tour or a massage on the beach. Hey, we may have even stayed in the lousy room. Instead we got the run around and left with a sour feelings. Oh and the 24 VIP room has a funky smell and lousy snacks. And room service is free once per day and not super fast so get up, order breakfast, make coffee if you have the coffee maker and enjoy your view if you have one. They were painting on our wing but the fumes didn\u2019t make into our rooms but we heard others complain. And the hot tub that looked so wonderful on the Expedia virtual tour, was closed as they were redoing it. It is also very annoying that the Swing Bar closes at 5 pm, the central pool side bar closes around 11 pm and they close down inside around 1 am. That is when you head to Mambo or another bar on 5th. And I agree with others, beware the time share folks they are the only barracudas we saw all week. They look like staff with their Real Resort shirts, but they are just trying to get you across the street to sell you on the Royal. Tell them you have a time share already-that might work. (I doubt it). They are persistent and annoying and I got to the point of telling them to leave me alone before I got really rude. And then I just ignored them beyond saying hello. We walked in to the Royal via the entrance by the boutique and had a quick look around. Don\u2019t come in the front and then you can check the place out. If you can\u2019t find your travel representative, head over to the Royal or ask the front desk for the number for the travel desk at the Royal. We could never find our North West/Worry Free representative and when we finally tracked him down, he was across the street. Yes, book your a la carte reservations early if you like dining between 6 and 8. The main buffet was extensive and better than average buffet quality. After all of the ugly, here is the good. The best part of the stay\u2014the people. The staff is overworked and underpaid. They will treat you with the same respect and kindness you treat them with, and then some. The animation team rocks and work so very very very hard and such long hours. But they way they get transferred from hotel to hotel with in the chain, you may not come across them again. The Spanish Lessons were great, personalized and a lot of fun. Phil at the swim up bar is fabulous. The easiest way to find the swim up bar the first time is to go up the stair case past he spa and gym (streetside). The location is great as you are close to Fifth Avenue and right on the beach. You can walk down past the Royal, Las Palapas and other hotels to where the other boats are and snorkel the reef beyond the boats for free if you have your own stuff. It isn\u2019t the best, but it is free and we saw lots of cool fish etc. The staff at the swing bar were great and if you want to chill on the beach with tunes, that is the end of the beach to find a lounger. Now here is the best tip I can give you\u2026relax, it is a holiday. We had so much go wrong in the beginning of our trip and we jut kept repeating, \u201cat least we are away from the snow, and can afford to get away!\u201d And if you need a name to drop \u2013 Nicholas Vasquez (not sure of the spelling) appeared to be the hotel manager. That is the bonus for reading our whole review!

We loved the location.Out the back of the lobby was the pool and beach,and out the front of the lobby was a 2 block walk to 5th Avenue.Fantastic!The room was always clean,the shower that wasn't draining was fixed as soon as I ASKED NICELY,( starting to get my drift?) The food was very good FOR MEXICO,the ala carte restaurants were good,with MARIAS our favourite.Lobster Thermador for an extra 14USD,was worth it,and the Mayan Coffee was a wonderful treat,especially the presentation! TIPPING-those that say it doesn't help are very wrong.I usually tip 150 to 200 USD during the week.If you made 8 USD per DAY,not hour ,you'd appreciate it too!We usually tip more money, less frequently,quite often 5 bucks a couple of times a week per deserving individual.Believe me,they don't forget you!One day at the above mentioned quiet pool,there were 10 people at the bar,and 4 of us at a separate table on the terrace.The only bartender left the bar to wait on us at our table! The Mexican people truly live by the golden rule.If you treat them with a smile and respect,you will receive the same thing in return.If not,you too will write a negative review!Don't believe any of the complaints.Remember,you are not on a Mediterranian Cruise,in Naples Florida,or Toronto,or Orlando,Los Angeles,or dining at Ruths Chris,etc.This is Mexico,set your expectations accordingly,let your hair down,relax,etc.If you can't-go to the above places and let the rest of us have a WONDERFUL TIME. PS.I finally tried snorkeling-we spent the whole day from 9 to 5 at XEL HA.ABSOLUTELY AWESOME!!! Do the all inclusive there,which gives you unlimited food,drinks,snorkeling,etc.for 100USD!

The hotel is beautiful with a fantastic ocean view. Not sure how the beaches were a few months ago but from the reviews we expected bad beaches. This is not the case at all. The beach was just fine and we didn't mind the boats that were docked in front. In fact, we thought it added character. There is a little less beach than there used to be from the pictures I'd seen here, but it's not as bad as some people might think. The rooms were very comfortable and clean and housekeeping did a great job in making up the rooms everyday. The food at the buffet was good and never cold. The pancakes are FANTASTIC! If you have a chance and like pancakes, get them. You will not be disappointed. If you want fantastic food, you MUST go to Il Pescatore, the Italian restaurant. It is so good and you have to make reservations early on in your stay because it books quickly. We were lucky and got 3 days but some don't get that many. If we had the chance, we'd have been there every night. The Mexican restaurant was nothing to write home about. The service was good, but the menu was disappointing and the food was just alright. The beach service is great. Having drinks brought to you while you relax on the beach is so nice. If you have a chance, check out the pool on the 3rd floor. It's small and secluded so there isn't a lot of traffic and it's nice and relaxing. Having the pool bar is nice and convenient. Get a Miami Vice...it's lovely! The hotel is just minutes from Fifth Avenue and while you can get good deals, be careful with the vendors you first meet when you turn the corner. They'll try to rip you off like they did with me. The further you walk, the better the deals and a lot of the time you'll get better deals at the stores with fixed prices. Also, some of the vendors will ask for tips, so be cautious of that too. The only real complaints I have were that there was no iron in the room even when we called and told there were and the same thing goes for the dvd player.

The beach offered excellant food and bar service and of course, the wait staff were always pleasant. The hotel's two A la Carte Restaurants were excellant. However, the hotel does not restrict its guests to two reservations per week, as most hotels do. This is a huge problem because there is very limited seating in these restaurants and they fill up quickly. The worst part is, that unless you book a reservation the minute you get there, you're probably S.O.L. I experienced this first had while waiting in line behind a lady who was making dinner reservations for eight people, over the next ten days, alternating nights between the two restuarants. Needless to say that others, like myself, were left with little choice. Definately a problem that the hotel needs to address. Aside from that, the food and the restaurants, buffet included, were wonderful. One could eat virtually 24 hours a day on the All Inclusive Plan, which we did! The hotel offers a safe in each room free of charge. We used the safe for everything and anything of value, every day, all day long. The Porto Real is located on the beach, but not necessarily the nicest beach. The water is somewhat rocky and local fishermen anchor their boats at the Porto Real beach. Government Property! Lots of security at the beach for the hotels guests, which wasn't needed, as we always felt safe at the hotel and anywhere that we went in Playa. We booked through Nolitours, which brags about having the exclusive to the standard rooms at the Porto Real. What a disappointment. Certainly nothing to brag about. The rooms were small. Nice, clean, but small. There are much larger rooms available, obviously through other tour operators, so beware if you book with Nolitours and room size is important to you. We chose to keep our room, since it was only a place to sleep at night. Based on the other reviews I've read since returning home, it seems we were lucky to get a room. Thankfully, we had a room ready as promised when we got there and never had a problem. We did not take in any Timeshare presentations offered by our hotel. Nor did we book any sightseeing tours with our hotel. We did get sucked into one Timeshare, at the airport. While their booths offer tourist information, their main goal is Timeshare. It turned out okay in the long run. We got two tickets each to three different attractions (turned the 4th one down) which saved us some $$$$.

We found the ocean to be a little disapointing.. alot of rocks everywhere and boats but we just went over to the Royal to swim. We loved being so close to the town, every night we would walk the strip. I think over all for what the area has gone thru (Wilma) they are doing a good job at trying to get things back to normal.

We usually eat in town anyway, but just ordering the basics was a bit labor intensive. I think that we were the only guests there that were not on the AI plan. Getting a chair by the pool is crazy. You better rise and shine early if you want to be by the pool or under a cabana. I even get up early, but not early enough. Also, the housekeeper stole all of my money out of my wallet while I was on my balcony for less than 2 minutes. I obviously noticed immediately what had occured( when I saw my wallet splayed on the bed with evry card out on the bedspread)and after a couple of days after reporting the incident and being questioned several times, the housekeeper returned to work and admitted to taking my money. I was re-imbursed in pesos only and was told to be quiet and to not tell anyone about what had happened.

The occasion was the wedding of my nephew. Firstly, let me say that the wedding coordinator did a fabulous job. The ceremony was beautiful and perfectly suited to our family. Not too fussy but very lovely. It was obvious to me that the hotel had undergone some serious renovations due to the hurricane. Everything was spotless and newly painted. My daughter and I received a room upgrade to a junior suite upon arrival. We were told it was just for one night but we were never moved which was fine with me! The room was very large with a big walk-in closet, huge bathroom and two very comfy beds. We didn't have a view but who cares...we spent very little time in it anyway. The standard room my sister was in was a little small but very nice. I highly recommend the two a la carte restaurants...Maria's and El 'something'. Top-notch service, fun atmosphere and fabulous food presentation. You must try a Mayan Sacrifice shooter at Maria's (see Ivan about that) and a flaming Mexican flag through a straw! We would end every night at the pool bar. Raphael and Sergio 'Garcia' were our bartenders and always made our evening enjoyable. One place you should not miss is the 3rd floor pool bar. After a hot day at the beach its a great cool spot for a drink made to order by Phillipe. The buffet restaurant was very nice. The selection was good and the food very tasty...no complaints! There's a nice lobby bar with big screen TV's. There is always plenty of opportunity to eat...no problem there. The new beach buffet had great food. Burgers, hotdogs, nachos, fries....great lunch stuff. Try the squid and shrimp salad...spicy and yummy! Don't forget to walk down the beach toward the Royal Porto and have a pina coloda at the new swing bar. It's quaint and unique. Lastly, I have to say that the location of the Gran Porto is what makes it truly a great hotel. I have stayed several times farther south on the Mayan Riviera and quite frankly wasn't sure I'd like to stay in town. Well, forget about that. I'll always stay in town now. A nice 5 minute stroll and you're on Quinta Ave. Go to the Tequila Barrel for their $2 Corona. Lots of great shopping and even better people watching. Caution: if you have any pretty young 'chicas' in your group you'll have to really keep your eye on them if you go to Carlo's & Charlie's. You've been warned!

Not a lot of swimming space. There was also a lot of seaweed. The hotel itself is beautiful, so if ocean swimming isn't your thing, it'll be ok. BUT, as for the Royal's beach, it was amazing! Seaweed and ship free. So, having our Gran Porto room switched to the Royal Porto was a blessing in disguise! I can't say anything about the food there because we didn't book the all inclusive. The food on 5th Avenue is amazing and cheap! Eat at Babe's Noodle bar, Los 3 Carboncitas, La Tarraya, Carmencitas, El Oasis and La Siesta. Enjoy drinks at El Pirata.

First, if you go to any resort or hotel from a RITZ CARLTON to a MOTEL 6 and anything in between, you will find something you don't like. Especially if you are looking for something negative! I understand that sometimes a bad experience can be completely unavoidable due to circumstances beyond anyone's control (or just plain horrible customer service), but why go on vacation with a \"white glove\" attitude and look for problems? Relax for crying out loud! You are on vacation! 5-Star, 5-Diamond, etc. Who really sets those standards, anyway (rhetorical question)? 5-Star standards (and perceptions) in the USA or Europe are usually quite different than other parts of the world. Now that I've vented, I can continue. My wife and I have traveled to Europe, Hawaii, Mexico, Jamaica, the Dominican Republic and several places in the mainland USA. We have stayed in everything from budget on up and thoroughly enjoyed the Gran Porto Real. ARRIVAL: Typical hustle and bustle of CUN airport and since it was our first time, we got duped into a \"tour\" of the Mayan Palace timeshare resort (Wow!). Didn't buy, but we left with 2 huge bottles of Kahlua, admission to Xcaret park with a free dolphin experience that we didn't use (ran out of time) and more cash than what we arrived with in Mexico. We booked round trip transfers through the GPR (Best Day Resorts) and the van ride to/from the airport was non-eventful. CHECK-IN: We were dropped off at the GPR, tipped our driver a couple bucks and were greeted with smiles and cold drinks (I think there was a cool towel there, but it's been awhile). No problems at check in and since we packed light we elected to take our bags on our own and proceeded directly to our rooms. The next day we agreed to do another \u201ctour\u201d of a Best Day Resorts property this time and ended up with free massages from the spa. We only agreed to do this because we were made to feel guilty for leaving the property to see another resort. In fact, I think the concierge was actually pretty angry at the bellman for letting us go. Oh well, the property was beautiful and we got more free stuff for saying \u201cno,\u201d what can I say? ROOMS: We stayed in a Jr. Suite on the first floor facing the new Royal Porto Real. At the time, the new RPR was still under construction but we were not bothered by any noise. The view from our balcony was nothing to write home about but it was private enough that we ordered room service for breakfast and enjoyed it every morning on our balcony. The room was very clean, stocked with various beverages (Coke, Water, Beer, etc.) and promptly serviced daily. The bathroom was more than adequate and, yes, the shower was HUGE! FOOD/BEVERAGE: The food was good with a decent selection and variety at all buffets. The snack bar at the beach was just okay and served burgers, hot dogs, nachos, tortilla chips (with a very tasty seafood salsa) and other finger foods. Didn\u2019t make it to the Mexican restaurant but the Italian was AWESOME. The drinks did seem a bit weak so you have two choices: ask them to make it stronger or just drink more! BEACH/POOL/SPA: Playa Del Carmen is (or at least used to be) a quaint fishing village and there are boats tied up at the beach in-front of the resort. It really is NOT a big deal. There is adequate beach and shallow water all around and if a boat happens to be in your way, go around it and get over it. You will see a few topless women on the beach (not allowed at the pool) but nothing overwhelming. The swimming pool is very nice and good sized for the resort. We were there in October and really didn\u2019t have a problem finding lounge chairs. My only complaint, and this is not directed at the resort but to most hotels in Cancun and Playa, the pools close so early. By sundown everyone was expected to be out of the pools and if not, you were told it was time to get out. A LITTLE SECRET: There is a roof-top hot tub above the spa pool with a beautiful view of the city and Cozumel that is pretty private and not really monitored much at night (wink, wink). My wife and I did visit the spa which we found was very nice and relaxing and both got a massage which I highly recommend. TIPS: Tipping is not expected and the service did not get worse if you did not tip, but we loved the idea of bringing a stack (20-25) of US $1.00 bills. Trust me on this; even a couple of dollars goes a long way. Overall, we had an excellent time at the Gran Porto Real and will definitely return the next time we go to Mexico. We recently returned from a week at Hedonism III in Jamaica which is a whole different story but if you want to relax with your spouse, significant other or the whole family, the GPR with its excellent service, facilities and proximity to almost everything Playa Del Carmen has to offer is an ideal hotel for your next visit to Mexico.", "Date": "October 9, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "1", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "3", "Service": "5", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Regina,SK", "Title": "\u201cwow\u201d", "Author": "pinkyanderson", "ReviewID": "UR4000692", "Content": "Well folks, there is virtually no beach left as of last week.

So if you are staying for more than 5 days, I suggest you venture out and see some of the night life. Another thing that really bothered us was the fact that by 9am all the lounge chairs by the pool (which is a very large area) were already reserved by guests. It was a little bit ridiculous waking up and seeing towels in every chair. We were asked on a couple of occassions by guests to get up from the chairs they had \"saved\" for themselves. The people that asked us to move had gone to 5th avenue to shop and were returning 2 hours later. Lastly, if you see anything wrong in your room, need info, learn to use the tv's message system.

We stayed 6 amazing nights at the Gran Porto Real. We took the all inclusive package. I think that the all inclusive was totally worth it. We didn't eat there everynight but at least twice a day. Being 22 years old you can imagine that the drinks and beer alone satisfied the value of the all inclusive not to mention activities that the resort offered you as an all inclusive memeber. The hotel was beautiful inside and out. Everyone was there to serve you. The rooms were great, very mexican cultured. I have to agree with some people that the beds were not the most comfortable in the world but then again the beds were not my main concern of my vacation. Now lets talk about the food. The buffet was a buffet. Not to mention that you are in a different country so it is expected that they are going to season the food differnetly. At any rate I enjoyed the buffet more at lunch time rather than dinner. We ate at the Italian restaruant once and it was really good. It felt like I was supposed to have like a 100 dollar checkl after the apps, dinner, dessert, wine and beer but it was all paid for. It was great. The outside environment at the beach and the pool was just my style. The music was going all day which always set my mood. The animation team had a goal to make sure everyone there was having fun. The beach was really nice. I think that all of the people that complained about the boats forgot to mention that they only took up a small portion of the beach. If you go toward the left there were none. They weren't soar to my eye either. From what I observed it was a great place for all ages. Great for honeymooners, vacationers or families. It is all about preference. Another thing is everything was very clean. I am always worried about bugs when I stay in places and I did not have any problem what so ever as far as that was concerned. Just a tip when planning your vacation. We went through a travel agency when booking the trip (Liberty Travel). Doing it that way led to a very structured vacation. There was a guy there representing the travel agency and Olympus tours which is the company that gives your transportation to and from the airport. He made sure that all of your flight info is in order and insures that you get back in time to the airport. In addition he will take care of any tours that you may want to venture out on. It felt more comfortable that way. Also the other advantage of going through the agency is Im thinking that the rooms you resevered are garenteed rather than just held. I had no problems checking in. It took me 3 minutes and I had the ocean veiw juinor suit I paid for. At any rate. I hope you find this review helpful. I really don't understand why all of the terrible reviews except for the fact that it is about preference.

We were all a bit nervous after reading some of the reviews on this site. BUT we were all SO excited to be vacationing we almost didn't care if the reviews were true. BUT - goodness - I don't understand where the negative reviews came from. First off - this is an all-inclusive. We go every Labor Day to Mexico - typically Cancun - this was our first visit to Playa. Let me say first off - the rooms were the best we've been to and we typically stay at 5 star all-inclusives. So just to touch on a few things: Rooms - HUGE! We had a Junior Suite - since we all wanted to be together we didn't get Ocean View - which was fine. The bathrooms were incredible. Housekeeping extremely timely - even got turn-down service. A/C cold all the time. They refilled the mini-bar every single day with bottled water, Cokes and beer. Food - The Albatros has great buffets. Keep in mind people - this is Mexico. You don't come to an all-inclusive for incredible food do you? At the Albatros - omelet bar for breakfast YUM! Also - if they have the taco bar at night - get it. Also - room service is free once daily - BLTs are very 'American' and good if you need something late-night. Beach - Since there are boats out front, go to the left to the far beach bar - the beach is beautiful there and only a few feet away and no boats. FYI - beach bar service - impeccable. Get the Miami Vice. Also - beware of the Tequila Slammers - they will creep up on you - haha. Also - pool bar on 3rd floor - hidden treasure. Front Desk/Service in General - ZERO problems. When we checked in they asked if we wanted to go across the street to the Royal Porto Real. Just say no people if you don't want to. All these people complained of hard sells to get you to move. If you don't want to - it takes a no. If you can't stand up with your decision - that's your fault not the front desk. Time Shares - Several people mentioned getting hassled about time shares? At NO point did ANY of us (6 of us) get approached or even hear the phrase 'time share' - and we were all over the place. Hidden - the all-inclusive 'VIP' club - we didn't find it til the last day. It has a soda fountain, bottled liquor to make your own drinks and even bottles of chilled champagne you can take to your rooms! FIND IT! Air hockey for the kids, etc. - it's open 24/7. Overall I can't go on and on enough about the service we received. SO friendly, SO polite and SO accomodating. 5th Avenue shopping great mix of flea market-like deals and upper-end shops. Bourbon Street bar great. Also - we did the snorkel excursion - best I've been on. I wish I could list my email address here if anyone had specific questions. This is an awesome resort - absolutely beautiful. HIGHLY recommend. I'm going to guess the people who gave the negative reviews are ridiculously picky or not accustomed to travel for fun rather than travelling to gripe.

The hotel was great. Minor glitches, such as we arrived at about 2:00AM (Continental had a weather delay) and we got a smoking room (even though we were explicit about a non-smoking room). Also, we had purchased a non-oceanview room, which was a BIG mistake. The view was terrible (construction) and there was no sea-breeze. The staff said that they would upgrade us for $40.00 USD a night - same as expedia. The staff was very helpful, got us upgraded and we were in the new room in 5 minutes. We thought that the food on the buffet was Great!. Good variety, hot food, and plentiful. The desserts were a bit weak, but overall, good. Staff was friendly, other than the odd person, which you will find anywhere on the planet. The entertainment staff were excellent. They worked extremely hard and long hours and were very polite and friendly. We did not take the all-inclusive plan since there were plenty of places within walking distance, and also we found that charging stuff to our rooms when we were there was actually cheaper than the all-inclusive. One minor point to note - if you don't get the all-inclusive, you have to pay for Kayak rentals, etc., but at $10USD an hour, it was a bargain. The fishing boats on the main beach were initially a bit of a dissapointment because it seemed that they tookup most of the beach-front. They make for a beautiful view though. The beach just by the hotel was a bit rocky, but we discovered that just past the pier, on the Royal side, is an incredible beach - it was great. We rented a car from the hotel and went to cancun for a day, did the snorkeling trip, etc. Thanks the Expedia's (Best Day's) representative who was very very helpful. This was a really neat thing to do and it made our vacation 2-in-1. Overall, our vacation was fantastic.

The worst experience we had was when my son broke his \"all inclusive\" plastic bracelet in the ocean and lost it. They wanted to charge us 100 dollars to replace it, as that is their \"policy\". Since we only had one day left and weren't eating the food anyway, we decided to forget it. That is when they told us we had to turn it in when we left anyway or they would charge us anyway. So, we were cohersed into paying them the money, NO matter how hard I tried, they would not make an exception. Coincidentally,, then our hot water went off for a half a day and we couldn't get anyone to fix it. Kept getting more excuses . Finally, someone came up and turned it back on, I wonder about that. So we felt pretty ripped off and angry and will never go back there. They have two restaurants where you could supposedly eat for free. The trouble is they only take like four reservations at a time, and we could only get in our last two days.

When we arrived, we were given a room that had a view into a back alley, a tv that didn't work etc. We immediately went down to conplain that this was not as advertised. They told us that the booking they got for us was for a regular room. They couldn't move us until our agent confirmed our booking. At that time we even offered to pay to upgrade for the night, and told them we would deal with our agent the next day. They then told us they had no suites available that night. We had to stay in the regular room that night period. To add insult to injury, we later figured out that the resort was only about 40% full the whole time we were there. So we should have had our proper room the first night, but they were not concerned about customer service at all. Needless to say we were back down at the front desk first thing the next morning, and eventually after about 3 hours of issues we were moved to our junior suite. I have to say Junior Suite was gorgeous, so we FINALLY started to relax. Beach -We ended up on the beach to the left of the resort. The area in front of the gran porto was not very nice, many fishing boats etc. The swimming was ok, not great for snorkelling, but the waves were fun. Service on the beach was next to non-existent. We were offered drinks maybe twice the whole week. (And yes we did tip, regularly). Food -Next major issue with this resort was the food. We were sick off and on the entire trip. Food was recycled, and not always fresh. We saw many breaches of proper food handling proceedures. Literally one of us was sick the entire vacation. We tried to make the best of it though. Great for weight loss actually! Service -Service was hit and miss. The beach service awful. The restaurants were hit and miss. Some waiters were great, others were not. I feel the management is the problem. It seemed like alot of unhappy workers. The front desk misled us about the hotel being full the first night, and I found there to not be a focus on customer service at all through the resort. So between checkin and the food I could not recomend this resort to anyone. If you do try it, whatever you do book the junior suite, the regular rooms are in my opinion horrible.

The location was a little odd... it's almost like the hotel is at a dead end, but the hotel is breathtaking. We checked in with no troubles (relief) and got to our two rooms within minutes. We asked for 3rd floor and ended up on 2nd floor but we did get two rooms right next to eachother and the views were blocked a little by palm trees, but I didn't mind that at all. We had a beautiful view of the ocean from either of our two balconies. Everyone is right about the showers... they are incredibly huge! We did the European Plan because I thought we'd wander for dinner, but ended up changing to AI mid-week because we thought it was a better bargain. For a family of 4, $200 a day for all meals, drinks and snacks wasn't bad. Our room was cleaned daily and we even got to know our maid and tipped her very well once we learned they only make $3 a day! I couldn't believe it. Unlike many others on the AI plan, we tipped. I can't believe people don't realize that on an AI, the hotel makes the money - not the employees, so we made sure we took care of them. I didn't care for the buffet outside, we didn't eat there at all. The inside buffet was well worth it for the money you pay. The Italian restaraunt was very very good. The Mexican restaraunt was a disappointment, the reviews are right about that. We even did room service one night and that was very interesting because they spoke no English and we ended up with a very interesting order but we thought it was humorous. If you bring kids with you, the entertainment staff at the pool does a great job. There are I think three young guys and one female that get the kids involved in different activities and they do a great job and have alot of fun while they're working. The wait staff at the pool/beach also do a great job of making sure your drinks are full. We didn't have anyone waking us up early to get towels as I've read in other reviews, and the maid didn't come until late afternoon so we had no problems with that. We didn't have anyone bothering us for timeshares, but they are trying to sell a vacation package for the Royal across the street - we bit and went for a tour and let me tell you that hotel was incredible. We went to Xel-Ha and did the Mayan Encounter tour through Alltournative, both were alot of fun but I would have to say the Mayan trip was my personal favorite. All in all we had a great trip.

I agree with the other people who do not recommend getting the all inclusive. We ate out on 5th Ave every night and did not have any trouble with getting sick. I can understand how people would get sick as I did see the lunch buffet sitting outside in the Mexican heat. If you do choose the all-inclusive, it is $50 US per person per day once you get there. There is nothing really wrong with the resort but I would not classify it as five-star. It is perhaps a three-star. We were paying $130 night so I wouldn't really classify it as 5-star prices for a beachfront resort either. The rooms are clean and decent sized but I didn't really consider our junior-suite a suite. It was more like a regular sized room with a large bathroom. The maids did knock on the door every morning at 7:30 to 8:00 to try to collect the towels.

The staff does not speak English and it is impossible to explain what you need from them. The maids had a tendency to remove the towels from the room shortly after 9 a.m. without replacing it with clean towels. We had to search for maids all over the hotel every afternoon to obtain clean towels. There is a construction going on both sides of the hotel. Prepare for noise and dust from early morning until very late evening. The beach was a disappointment. They had never cleaned garbage, stones, and pieces of concrete from the bottom of the sea. It is very crowdy on the beach, and the security guards are practically standing above your head with very loud walkie-talkies, thus violating your piece and quiet (they probably think that they are very important FBI guys). The entertainment consisted of half-drunk middle-age men from the audience who were conned to dance on a stage in a sombrero. It is a two-star resort that markets itself and charges as for a 4-5 star resort. I would not recommend it to anyone.", "Date": "May 22, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Service": "3", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Marysville, WA", "Title": "\u201cHad a great time!\u201d", "Author": "vivalv66", "ReviewID": "UR3490862", "Content": "We stayed May 12-19. Two couples. Booked though a TA. Caught our shuttle at airport no problem but lots of people trying to get you to buy tours etc. Hotel check in very quick. Rooms are nice. We had ocean front junior suites. Some palm trees in way but not bad. Seems like most all the rooms have palm tree obstruction. Shower is huge! Rooms very clean. Beds are hard but never bothered us. Never had problems with housekeeping. Always had clean towels. They cleaned our room pretty late.We tipped on the last day. We were on 2nd floor. Lighting in bathroom is bad. We did AI. It was fine. I had omlettes for breakfast. Tip the cooks they work so hard! Nothing spectacular as far as the food but good. Nice waiters! We left tip on table every meal as they were so friendly. Ate on 5th Ave twice. Nice places to chose from. Cost about the same as the states. The ambiance of some of the restaurants on 5th is what I liked. Nice to sit outside and people watch. Ate at the hotel restaurants also.Nice wait staff also. Some better then others as with anywhere. Got into the Italian place twice with no reservations. Mexican restaurant said no. (they were not full) who knows why they are like that. Made reservations for other nights. Make your reservations at the concierge desk right when you arrive. If you don't use them it is not a big deal but at least you will have them. The food was good. They do it up real fancy like on a cruise ship. Jorge at Mexican is very friendly! Beach is nice. There are rocks and boats but never bothered us. Cocktail service on beach was slow sometimes but you find everything is slow in Playa. We did tip them everytime. They work so hard. Beach around corner gets windier. Beach in front of Royal not as nice and really windy. You can not use the Royal anymore either. Pool is nice but it can be hard to find a chair. We liked the beach. Lots of chairs! pool on 3rd floor is not really advertised. It is really nice. Swim up bar is great. Pools close at 9. kind of early but we swam at 3rd floor after hours and nobody complained. One bit of advice..everywhere you go they want to sell you time shares, tours etc. If you are interested and want to spend the time they will pay you. If not just say no! They assign you a representitive when you arrive and make an appt for you to see them in the morning to schedule your shuttle back to airport. It is a time share and tour sell! We did not go. We scheduled our shuttle the day before we left no problem. Us 2 girls stayed on beach while husbands went diving. We also did a Catamaran tour. We booked these ourselves by asking around. Learned a lot that way. Catamaran was in Cozumel. We walked to ferry. There are 2 ferries and they scream at you to buy! It is funny and nerve racking! Check the ferry times before you buy the ticket. We got stuck in Cozumel for 2 hours- no 7:00 ferry. Missed our dinner reservations. No big deal ate in Cozumel while waiting. We also did Xcaret. Booked ourselves also and saved a little. Swam with dolphins and it was incredible. Xcaret park itself in my opinion is not really worth it. (maybe for kids)The underground river is really crowded and dirty. We left after that. A shame you have to pay the park entrance to get to the dolphins. One persons did get sick but we think it was heat exhaustion not the food. Overall we had a great vacation. We would go back but there are many other places I would like to travel to first.

Our stay was very enjoyable. We did not opt for the all-inclusive package and we were very happy with our choice. We were only in our rooms to sleep, shower or take a quick afternoon nap before heading out to 5th Avenue and the beach. This hotel is beautiful and very clean. There were only two problems that stood out during our stay. First, the maids, etc. knocked on our door every morning starting at 8:30 am. The maid would come by first looking for any dirty towels (apparently they have a limited number for the amount of guests). About 9:30 am, a \"juice/water\" person would roll up to our door (we could hear him coming because it sounded like a truck) and would try to re-stock our refrigerator. Note that his entire selection was warm and not iced down. Room service in general was great. At some point later in the afternoon they would come to clean our room. This was done very well with no issues. They even left little \"towel scupltures\" on our bed. The second problem was the never ending harassment we received walking through the lobby area to take a tour of the new hotel they are building next door across the street. No matter how many times we came across the same employee, they would inevitably try to stop us and get us to sign-up for the tour. By the way, you can simply walk over there and see the hotel yourself. It is beautiful. One major word of caution, it IS still under construction and will be for at least a year. My sister-in-law stayed there and had to change rooms to the north side of the hotel because of the construction that awoke her every morning at 7 AM. Note that we could not here this at all on the seaside of the older hotel. On a very positive note, our view was everything we could ask for; right on the beach, a stone's throw from the water. All in all, a great stay. We would consider going back to this hotel, but after seeing all of the others available, we will probably choose a less expensive one seeing as all of our time was spent eating out and exploring the endless amounts of bars and nightclubs. Playa del Carmen is a sight to be seen. The beach is amazing, the food/bars on 5th Avenue have all kinds of menus and pricing and everyone was nice, helpful and friendly.

We checked in Saturday late afternoon on April 23rd. We were immediately escorted to our room - across the street. My stomach sunk when we headed that direction because of all of the negative revues. But when they opened the door to our room, I thought I had died and gone to heaven! It was beautiful. We were 3rd floor directly overlooking the ocean. It was clean and spacious with beautiful fixtures, a nice big Jacuzzi. The construction was waning as the Grand Opening was set for the following Saturday the 30th for the new \"Royal\" Porto Real (where we stayed). There was still a bit of hammering and sawing but it really wasn't bad. I will say that our phone never worked (and we reported it twice). Which was really no big deal except as a result, we could not order room service. And the hot water was intermittent. Sometimes it took 5 minutes for it to come out hot. The housekeeping staff did a fantastic job. Picked up our few clothes we left around, organized our toiletries, etc. We did do the all-inclusive program. The people were friendly, very helpful. The wait staff were always there to freshen your drink be it pool-side or lounging on the beach. We tipped them nearly every time they came around but even the pikers who were not tipping were getting equal attention. We ate dinner at each of the three restaurants and maybe I lucked out with what I ordered, but my food was fantastic. You do have to make reservation for dinner a couple of days in advance, which I was a bit puzzled by. The first night we were there we went to Pelicano's and asked if we needed to have reservations for that night in order to eat and were told we did. What was strange was there were plenty of open tables, well over half. So, I'm not sure about that. The buffet was, well, a buffet. The food was okay but very convenient if you want to get in and out. Again, the wait staff seemed very quick to offer anything. The beach in front of the new Royal was superior to the one in front of the Grand. It could not have been improved upon. The sand was perfect, the water optimal temperature and crystal clear. Lots of Europeans and as a result, lots of topless women on the beach. Maybe 1 in 10 or 15 were sans top. We went to town a couple of times and it was a very fun place both day and night. I got tired of the venders constantly hustling you to buy something but overall it had a terrific atmosphere. We made a trip to Xcaret, which I would not recommend. It was expensive and very touristy. Overall, I would highly recommend the Porto Real.

After reading all of the negative reviews regarding overbooking at the Gran Porto Real (where we initially booked) we were nervous upon check-in. We called the hotel directly two days before arrival and were told that we would not be bumped to the unfinished hotel across the street. Upon arrival, we were not given any information about the resort. No map, no list of activities, no list of services available, no list of restaurants, and no information about what the resort had to offer. To add to our aggravation at the check in desk we were told that there was NO ROOM at the Gran Porto Real and that we would be bumped across the street. When we voiced our concerns about the noise across the street we were told that construction began at 8am to 5pm and that it shouldn\u2019t disrupt our stay. We were initially thrilled about our room in the Royal Porto Real (large Jacuzzi tub, great d\u00e9cor, great view from the balcony etc.) But, it was shorted lived due to Construction noise starting at 7:00 am to 2:00 am the next morning. Since the Grand Opening of the Royal Porto Real was May 1, 2005, the day of our departure, construction people worked around the clock in order to complete things before the opening. Every night was a sleepless night. We were there to vacation yet this trip has caused more stress than delight. We went to the front desk two mornings in a row to ask to be moved to the Gran Porto Real, which we had booked at, we were told that there was no room to accommodate us. A pleasant front desk worker named Louis saw that we were dissatisfied because of the noise and showed us two other suites in the Royal if we wanted to move. Unfortunately, the other two rooms were closer to the noise, so the move didn\u2019t work for us and we stayed put. The service at this hotel was revolting. Room service food was awful. There is no menu in the room so we had no idea what was available through room service. One evening we called to order room service and had to leave a message - they never called back to take our order. We called several times and our calls went unanswered and when someone finally did speak to us we were left waiting more than half hour for items. Room service was not apparent at this hotel. Housekeeping did a deficient job at cleaning our rooms. They took our used bathroom towels in the morning and didn\u2019t leave enough clean ones to replace them, toilet paper was never restocked and our mini bar was rarely replenished. We tipped housekeeping the first three days of our stay but than we stopped once service began to slack off even more. The buffet and a la carte restaurants were repulsive. Various guests complained of this and several people we spoke to complained of food poisoning. The food was uncooked and extremely repetitive and stale. Not what someone would expect for a so-called \u201c4 star plus resort\u201d. The Mexican restaurant, Maria\u2019s was very authentic and did a great job at providing entertainment, too bad the food was terrible. The Italian restaurant, Il Pescatore, was not Italian food by any means, and being Italian I can say that it was a ignominy to Italian culture (Mexicans prepared the food so that would explain why). Any guest that enjoyed that food (and there were some people that did) clearly has no acumen of what food expectations should be on a resort. Being the frequent vacationer that I am I can honestly say that this resort is not a 5 star nor 4 star plus but quite possibly a 3+. Don\u2019t let the gorgeous d\u00e9cor and views fool you.

Also, the other two people who went with us stayed in a room that had just been finished. They didn't have a phone, which made it hard to communicate.

Some parents were there as \"chaperones - read: they just sat there and watched their kids get drunk and act stupid.\" We were unfortunate enough to get a room next to a group of kids who kept us up EVERY NIGHT. They came home very early in the morning/late at night and partied in their room until 5 or 6 a.m. We called to complain, but nothing really happened. We should have demanded that we be moved. It really ruined the trip for us. The Gran Porto Real should put all the kids at the hotel across the street so that the adults can get some rest. Every bar in the resort was packed with bratty kids (as well as the clubs in Playa) and a few parents who could have cared less how badly their CHILDREN annoyed everyone else there.

We booked a Junior Suite Ocean View, and after reading all of the negative reviews regarding overbooking, we were nervous upon check-in. Well being nervous was not necessary at all!!! We arrived around 12:30pm and our room was ready!! Room 329. It was nicely decorated and very spacious. Our balcony had a great ocean view & the bathroom was amazing!!! The only down side to the room was the bed (very hard, something we are not used to) and the pillows (lumpy & hard as well.) The maids kept the rooms cleaned and the beverage guy always kept our fridge stocked! The pool at the hotel was very nice & had a tropical feel to it. However, the beach area directly in front of the hotel had several fishing boats which took up a lot of the swimming space. The ocean had a very rocky bottom, making it hard to walk. We chose to spend our time mostly @ the Royal Porto next door. The pool there had a luxurious feel to it and it was not nearly as crowded as the Gran Porto. Probably because there was construction going on which probably prohibited people from using the pool there. The construction was not a problem for us. It was not anywhere near the pool. The hotel is mostly finished. Just working on the main lobby at this point. The beach area by the Royal Porto was nice, but had a lot of seaweed. We both had massages @ the spa, 80 minutes each. These were wonderful! The service at both hotels was very good. They were very accomodating and willing to do anything to make your vacation as wonderful as possible. The location was amazing! Being able to walk into town was very convienant. So much to see & do. Now onto the negative aspects of the trip: THE FOOD. we did the all-inclusive plan. Let me just say that THANK GOD for the restaurant at the Royal Porto, Pelicano's. It was the only decent place to grab a bite to eat. (Breakfast, lunch or dinner - dinner is reservation only) My husband & I are not picky either. The food was way less than average at all three restaurants at the Gran Porto. The only place at the Gran Porto for breakfast & lunch is the buffet restaurant, Albatros. It was not good at all. Couldn't even tell what some of the food was @ times. The other two restaurants, Maria's (mexican) and Il Pescatore (Italian) were dinner only & you had to make reservations in advance. We arrived on a Thursday. One of the first things we did was go to the Concerige desk to make reservations. The earliest we could get in was Sunday! Our advice is to make your reservations as early as possible but plan on not being able to get into the speciality restaurants for a few days into your vacation. This may be due to the fact that guests at the Gran Porto & Royal Porto are eating @ the same places. Even the food @ the speciality restaurants were not that good. They make it look good w/presentation, but eating it wasn't that enjoyable. Good desserts are hard to come by as well. Oh, and while dining @ the Mexican restaurant, Maria's, we saw a COCKROACH!!! yes, a COCKROACH. I guess maybe in Mexico, it may not be a big deal, but here in the US, it is a sign of uncleanliness. My husband & our waiter had a conversation about it. He stated that the resort is very clean (which all the public areas were kept clean, you always saw someone cleaning something) Of course, we never saw the kitchen! He blamed it on the construction next door... I want to stress this: do not go to this resort for the food. You will be very disappointed!!!! Like I said before, it was way less than average. We did however, go into town & had some great meals @ Limones, La Parilla, La Casa de Agua, & the Blue Lobster. All great restaurants. Our favorite was Limones. We also ate gelato a couple nights @ Ciao Gelato. The food was a downer but we still had a wonderful time. Probably wouldn't go back to the Gran Porto, but maybe would be interested in staying at the Royal Porto.

We used the pool at the new Royal and the beach in front of the Royal the days there was too much seaweed in the water in front of the Porto Real. Food was great, the Restaurants at the Porto Real plus the PELICANOS at the Royal,reservations no problem,food very good,at IL PESCATORE Jose or one of the waiters will make flaming coffee, takes about 1/2 hour depending how many is at the table..make sure you ask for it it is not on the menu..what can you say a buffet is a buffet. The wait staff are excellent, beach waiters are asking you want you want before you finish your drink. There are 3 laptops set up in the Best Day Tour Kiosk, you put in pesos and can access the internet,we discovered this by accident. Also if you need to call home buy a phone card,we bought our through our Air Can.

Take the bike tour it is at 10 am and 4 pm daily, you see ruins in Playacar, and we stopped at Ricky Martins house!!! didnt see him..lol..when we stopped at the ruins in Playacar, there was a Mayan wedding being held,with tradional dressed people with all kinds of cermonial things, really interesting. Fifth Avenue lots of fun.. We took a cab one day to Puerto Aventuras, walked around seen the dolphins,rays,manatees,on the way back stopped at Sam's Club, you can get a day pass, did some shopping. We had gone to Cozumel and Tulum, last year, so we spent most of our time on the beach, in the water using the kayaks and boggie boards. there were a number of weddings while we were there but on Thursday night there was a wedding reception on the beach, quite a few people, we think the couple got married in the church,because we seen the wedding procession dance all the way down the street led by a mariachi Band to the Porto Real, they either had a live band or singers with canned music,but the music started around 11 pm and went on to around 2:30-3 in the morning, it was VERY VERY LOUD, I called the front desk and complained as others did, the night before there was a reception with music further down the beach which was no problem,but this was located right in front on the beach, and all rooms on the first,second and third floors facing the ocean didnt get much sleep..we complained to the Front Desk again in the am and to our Air Canada Vac Rep...not sure if this was an isolated thing,but if the wedding dances are going to be that loud,they are in for some big problems,no consideration for all the guests trying to sleep. ..Anyone going who is an animal lover esp cats, there is a vacant lot on Fifth Ave there are about 6 very thin kitties living there,each night I got take out from the buffet,lots of fish,chicken, etc and took it down to them..the lot is on the left side going down Fifth just down from the Brazilian Steak House..please feed the kitties..

We went all-inclusive. There was my husband, myself, and our 2 children, age 8 and 13. I had been reading the reviews for quite awhile, and although I found as the new hotel construction was getting further along the reviews got better, I was still concerned about what was going to happen when we got there. We arrived at 10 p.m. Check in was easy, and we were told to see a bell boy for directions to our room. The bell boy told us our room was across the street at the new hotel (Royal Porto Real) and he would bring our bags up in a few minutes. I was not suprised to be sent across the street so off we went. The room was absolutely beautiful, so we decided not to complain and see how loud the construction was going to be. Well, we were not disturbed at all by the construction, but because the floors are all tile and marble, the sound carries through the hallways and from the rooms above, so when guests were walking through the hallways, it was very loud, especially late at night. We still decided to stay in the new room. The pool in the new hotel was open and had lots of room all day. There is a swim up bar and the service poolside and beachside was great. You would never go thirsty, especially if you tip the wait staff. They really do appreciate it. The beach was also beautiful and not too rocky if you walked further up a bit. The buffet did get really boring, so we ate at the a la carte restaurants quite a bit. We had the buffet for breakfast most mornings, but had lunch at the new restaurant, the Pelican, a few times. You order off the menu and the food is awesome. All the restaurants were great, and the quantity of the food was good also. This hotel lacks big time in entertainment. It was boring, boring, boring in the evenings. We were expecting more than we got. We would love to see the Royal Porto when its finished. It is going to be beautiful. The rooms at the Gran run from $99.00 to $230 USD per night. The Royal runs from $250 to $350 USD per night. We would go back to Mayan Riviera again, but I think we would try a different hotel next time, just to compare. Anyway, if you are staying at the Gran or the Royal, enjoy!!

We arrived in the afternoon and were checked into our room shortly thereafter. I did see one guy pretty pissed because he didn't get a room, so i believe everyone on here who has had similar problems with the resort. Luck of the draw i guess. ROOM: Very big room, big bathroom, big shower, big everything. Plenty of space to move around, very unlike a typical American hotel. The smell was a bit musty but you get used to it quick. The beds are no good, i recommend bringing your own pillow as well. I rarely slept on the bed myself. The maids were very helpful and cleaned our rooms multiple times a day. They even folded our clothes that were all around the room. I didn't mind, but if you don't like your stuff messed with, tuck it away. FOOD: The buffet was hit or miss, but you could always find something edible. The outdoor lunch buffet was pretty good, had your american stand bys (burgers, dogs, and fries) along with some other stuff (ribs, wings). The reservation restaurants were amazing. We had all inclusive and for what you get it's a pretty good deal. The presentation is as good as the food itself. And of course, unlimited drinks, so if you are into that go all-inclusive. I tried to tally up what it would have cost if we'd paid cash and most of our dinners were close or over $100. Inflated prices or not, it was worth it when you factor in other meals and drinks all day. SERVICE: Whoever complained about service here is spoiled. If you didn't have a drink in hand you didn't have to wait more than ten minutes to be refilled. If that's two long, there are enough bars in the vicinity of the beach to waddle up to and get a drink yourself. There were never lines and the baristos were always willing to serve you. PEOPLE: Everyone seemed nice, some of them nicer than others of course. You have to realize that these people live on $200 pesos a day ($20 dollars), so if their a little cranky that you make that much an hour, let it go. I'd say 90% of the staff talked to you like they were there to serve you and into their jobs, 10% were dragging along. Not bad considering those percentages where you work, right? TOWN: Has a very European feel to it. Aside from us, everyone was either from across the pond or from Michigan. Not to many street vendors or beach vendors, and prices were not as dirt cheap as many other places in Mexico. THE CONSTRUCTION ZONE: They are building another resort on the beach right across the street. As of April 9, it was about a month away from completion. My wife and I checked it out and found the pool area was finished, and it is far superior to the pool at the Gran Real. We spent a day there just for something new. Honestly, after seeing the new building, i'd wished we had been sent over there. I'm sure it was worse off a month or two ago but it has quieted down considerably. OVERALL: We'll go back. I think it was about $1300 per person for us to stay in a jr. suite, 1st floor, including airfare. So you figure $600 round trip airfare, so maybe $100 per person per day at the resort. Not bad in my book.

We were there right after Easter. The weather was beautiful. 90 degrees and sunny every day - even though the weather forecast stated partly cloudy each day! The Gran Porto Real is at the end of the street on the beach. It is a very nice hotel. Two pools on the main level. Everything open. The beach was beautiful. Even though there were many fishing boats right in front of the hotel. Just north of the hotel were clear stretches of beaches. If you went about 300 yards north of the hotel, many Europeans stayed and you got to see some young women sunbathing topless. Definitely a plus!!! The Gran Porto Real is about 2 blocks from 5th Avenue, which is about 1 to 1 1/2 miles long with many great restaurants and shops. We ate at the Blue Parrot, Blue Lobster and Media Luna. All excellent restaurants. We rented a car from Executive Car Rental for $70 (US) a day and drove to Chichen Itza. We took the road to Cancun (307) and then took the toll road (180) to Chichen Itza. It took about 2 1/2 hours. We had no problems and got there before the tour buses!! Definitely a plus. Top Rental Car in the hotel rents cars for $45 (US) a day but those cars are manual only. The rental rates for both companies include all insurance. US insurance is not valid in Mexico. The Gran Portal Real is a very nice hotel. 4-5 stars. Sometimes a little noisy due to the programs near the pool at night. In addition, everything is tile which allows the noise to reverberate. We did not do the all-inclusive option and used the $150 (US) per day savings to eat in town. I think a very wise move. Most excellent meals were in the 100 to 150 peso range. ($9-14 US). There was an ATM machine on 5th Avenue. If you go to Chichen Itza, buy your souvenirs there. They were much cheaper than in Playa Del Carmen. Also if you climb El Castillo be prepared for a very steep descent. Very steep. I and my daughter came down step-by-step on our butts!!!! I'm glad we did it, but just be prepared for the steepness.

When we left Minneapolis the temperature was 26 degrees and Saturday afternoon it was 91 degrees in Playa Del Carmen. Not bad! Yes, there were some initial issues, but given the total experience, we would certainly return for another stay in the future. Here are a few of the details related to our experience. My fear of arriving and being told that the hotel was over-booked and that we needed to move across the street into the \"new property\", better known as \"the construction zone\" came true. They were out of rooms when we arrived and after some significant discussion the manager took us across the street to the first room. Unfortunately, the king bed and hot tub would have appealed to my wife and I if we were by ourselves, but our two children (ages 17 and 15) needed a place to sleep too. So, off to the next room, a junior suite with two beds. The rooms in the new property are absolutely beautiful, but there was construction going on around us. VERY LOUD. And, another surprise....we were informed that the electricity and water would be shut off until 3:00PM. They were finally turned on at 6:15PM. The next morning I demanded to be moved back across the street into a junior suite, and from then on our room worked out well and we had a great time. Other comments worth sharing would be the meal situation. We were \"all inclusive\", so the food and drinks are included. The main floor buffet got old real fast. It's OK for breakfast and lunch, if you don't eat at the outside beachside buffet, but I would highlighly recommend you pass on eating at the buffet in the evenings and make reservations at one of the other three casual resturants. There are mexican, seafood, and Italian options, with a menu to fit almost anyone's tastes. We took two day trips, one to Xel-Ha (snorkeling) and Tulum (Mayan Ruins) - which everyone enjoyed, and a day trip on the ferry to Cozumel.

Anyway, the beach area is kept clean, the boats were no problem as there was plenty of room to the side of them to swim in the ocean. The beach itself is plenty large and there was more than enough room for everyone. Hilliaro and his staff of waiters do a wonderful job of keeping everyones glasses full while on the beach or poolside. He gaves us all big hugs when we were leaving and told us he would miss us.

We knew there were problems with the hotel over booking, but like many other hopeful couples, we hoped this would not happen to us.... wrong..... What it really boils down to, if we had received the rooms we paid for, which were ocean view jr suites when we first checked in, we would have been very happy, and this review would be completely different. All the dissatified travelers are ones who were moved to the unfinished, in full swing construcion new hotel. And can you really blame them for being upset...My husband has a bad knee and had to walk up 3 flights of stairs.. yes no workng elevators, but they don`t tell you that when you are moved. So if your review was good...it goes to show... you lucked out with a good room. We had to fight with the hotel staff for 3 days, to finally get the room we had paid for...and yes it was beautiful ... Our friends never got the rooms they paid for. The 3rd floor has the good ocean view ...2nd floor the palm tree`s take up most of the view, 1st floor, too much activity and noise near the pool area of the beach. The waiters and the maids are very sweet and helpful, but if you do not go all inclusive then you are not tended to as much. We were given all inclusive for the first 2 days, as part of their compensation for not giving us our rooms we had already paid for. So my best advise to you is if you are bumped to the new hotel, be very firm and go down to the desk the very next day and insist on a room change. I feel once the new hotel is complete...which looks like at least 6 months, some of these problems should resolve. I also think the earlier you check in ensures the best chance you will have of getting a good room. On the positive side... the beach was beautiful, the town of Playa and the walk on 5th ave is so much fun...tons of shops and wonderful restaurants. Our favorite restaurants were The blue Lobster, Palapa Hemingway, La Parrilla and Casa del Agua... The day trips were wonderful... go to Xel-ha and Tulum... but Xel-ha day trip should be a full day..there is so much to see. Try to see Cozumel too.

Four of us stayed at the Gran Porto Real from Sat. Mar. 5th to Sat. Mar. 12th and I felt since this forum was (is) such a great help to me I would post a review. This was exactly the type of resort that I prefer...relatively small, low rise buildings, only 3 stories, within walking distance of food, drinks, shopping or what ever else you might want or need, beautiful beach (yes there are fishing boats parked in one area but I couldn't see any negative issue with them)...there was always someone cleaning, painting, repairing etc., the wait staff couldn't possibly have been more attentive, helpful or pleasant. I found the front desk staff to be for the most part great as well...having said that we were shipped across the street to the new resort but moved the next morning to the 2 Jr. King Suites we booked, by 10:00 am.... with a smile. The Royal is going to be a fabulous resort when it is completed...the two 3rd floor Jr. Suites they gave us were huge and had magnificent ocean views, although not sure the rooms were completely furnished,...we chose not to stay there because we didn't want to face the construction but more importantly for me the elevators are not installed yet and a ground floor room or elevator was what I wanted. I am sure until the Royal is finished this will continue to be an issue... There was enough variety at the buffets with something to suit all of our tastes...Maria's was good, the Italian restuarant was excellent and the newly opened Pelicano, oceanfront at the Royal was excellent the first night. The four of us had a wonderful time at the Gran Porto Real...we went with the idea it is a 4* resort and it met our expectations...I would recommend it as such!!!

It was paradise! We stayed in a Junior Ocean View Suite on the 2nd floor. Each morning we opened our eyes to the beautiful Caribbean Ocean, as the resort gradually came to life. We got up around 6:30, and put our towels and books on our lounge chairs to reserve them until we got our swimsuits on, etc. It's very laid back, I just ran down in my pajamas each morning and got our chairs set up. During our stay we walked around the hotel a bit, and up to the 3rd floor, and saw the pool and rooms facing the street and construction of the new hotel. This is a whole different world from staying in an ocean view room. You need to upgrade to a Jr. Ocean View Suite if you didn't reserve one to get the most of your experience. We didn't even hear any construction going on. But, the guys thought it was interesting to watch the workers. Even if you do have a room that faces the street, you will be spending your time on the beautiful beach anyway, not to worry. How can you go wrong with the ocean...very shallow you can play in the water for hours, and then the wait staff...bringing you drinks of choice constantly! They really aim to please, but you have to remember that you are not in the U.S. and your expectations of service may differ somewhat. They do make mistakes, but SO WHAT...they are trying! Don't bring too many clothes, you stay in your swimsuit all day if you plan to do the beach thing. I was barefoot 90% of the time, even in the hotel itself. It is all beautiful there. Don't worry. Maybe those that wrote the lesser-rated reviews were thinking that a Five-star U.S. hotel could be plunked down along the Riviera Maya and have the same service. It can't happen. Sometimes you are shorted a handtowel in the bathroom, or the hairdryer doesn't work the best. Those things do not ruin a vacation to paradise. This hotel is wonderful for a Mexico hotel. Give them some slack, you are in a different country and enjoy the beauty! We want to go back twice a year. Have a wonderful time! A few tips: The bathrooms are not the cleanest in the resort, so I carried Wet Ones in my beach bag and travel size bottles of the anti-bacterial lotion in my purse.

A few days later, we were transferred to room 354, which was huge and had an amazing view of the ocean and of the new pier. We were there for our wedding on Feb 23rd and our honeymoon on the 2nd week. Patty, the wedding coordinator, did a wonderful job setting everything up for us. Elsy, the concierge, also was a big help, sending up Champagne and having our bedroom decorated with rose petals on few occassions, and reserving spots for us at both Maria Marguerita and Il Pescatore. <By the way, when eating at Maria Marguerita's, try to ask for Ivan or Victor to be your waitor. They are simply amazing.> The all-inclusive package is really worth it, since if you add up what it costs you to eat at either the Mexican or Italian restaurants, or even in town, you'll find it a lot less expensive. Although, while in Mexico, you need to try out a few restaurants as well, so I recommend trying Yaxche and La Perilla. Yaxche ( just off of La Qunita ) serves a lot of traditional Mayan dishes that haven't changed recipes in hundreds of years, and La Perilla is great and always packed and is right on La Qunita. When we visit down south, we like to combine the beach with the sites of the area, so try to visit the ruins of Tulum, Coba and Chichen-Itza, Cozumel, cenotes, Little towns towards Tulum like Akumal and try to explore the streets after La Qunita, like 10th, 15th, 20th and so on.

There are the most accomodating people and couldn't do enough for you.

They were also able to put all five rooms close together. We stayed on the first floor in Jr. Suites which was the perfect spot to get to the beach!

The beach is in a perfect location, great people watching and not nearly as windy as other beaches. We never really had to fight for chairs on the beach, although it does pay off to get up early!

The rest of the beach is wide open with wonderful spots for snorkling and swimming. The breakfast and lunch at the resort were just what we expected, nothing fancy and perfect for what we wanted. We did opt to eat out on 5th Ave. almost everynight. We couldn't miss out on the fantastic bars and restaurants. We had so much fun people watching and checking out the local bars! I would recommend checking out the other side of 5th Ave where there are less tourist. We asked some locals where they would eat and that is the area they recommended. We also went to the bar Ole, almost everynight. Two for one drinks! All in all this was the perfect location for a goup of ten couples needing a break from the cold Pacific Northwest.

I could always find something to eat, but was not overly thrilled. Breakfast is great, though. We ate at the Italian restaurant and did not like it very much. We actually had our best dinner at the Mexican restaurant. There are plenty of places to eat in town, and we did once. The location couldn't be better.

After our first day at the Gran Porto Real my husband sent me to take care of any business that required dealing with the front desk for the rest of our stay because he found them so frustrating. We were told that we would get the room we had originally requested two days into our stay, and after discussing it we decided we would rather unpack and settle in to the room we received and give up the battle. It\u2019s vacation right? Oh, also most of the people we talked to that were visiting the hotel didn\u2019t have a problem checking in, so we were just the unlucky ones. Maybe we weren't aggresive enough? The food at the buffet was not good. It was mass produced and cold most of the time. Every day lunch and dinner had a different theme (Italian for example) but the food was the same old boring and tasteless stuff. Don\u2019t even bother trying dessert. On a positive note, the dining room was really nice and the breakfast was actually pretty good. The two restaurants at the Gran Porto Real were both good with nice atmosphere and they used excelent presentation. The Italian one was delicious and the service was great. They weren\u2019t kidding when they said you have to make reservations days in advance to get into the Italian one. Even though we were warned in advance, this seemed pretty silly to me since we had already paid for the hotels amenities but hardly got the chance to use them. The room service was prompt and the people were nice. Try the club sandwich and don\u2019t be afraid to them and ask for \u201ca lot\u201d of bottled water. We had them bring up about 6 bottled water at a time to keep us stocked. The fridge was stocked every day with soda and a couple beers which was nice. The pools at the Gran Porto Real were great. Very clean and refreshing. We definatly recommend going up to the second floor pool that has a swim up bar. Nobody seems to even know it is there so there were very few people hanging around. During the days we lounged on the beach and swam in the pool and the ocean. One day my husband had a really good time playing beach volleyball organized by the entertainment staff. For the most part we ended up wandering down the beach and exploring 5th Avenue. Our room was really nice, with big statue type things in the corners and beautiful furniture. The bed was huge and comfortable but the pillows were hard as a rock. Bring your own if that matters to you. The shower was really cool because of its size. Overall, we would not return to the Gran Porto Real. I must say that it looked like about half of the other guests were really enjoying themselves. There were a lot of activities for kids to do so it seemed like a good place to bring the family. To be fair I guess it just comes down to whether or not you are an \u201call-inclusive\u201d person.", "Date": "February 17, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Kitchener, Ontario Canada", "Title": "\u201cLoved every minute of it.\u201d", "Author": "cantwait40", "ReviewID": "UR3198517", "Content": "Just returned from two weeks in the sunny Mexico resort. This is our 2nd time going to this resort. We had lots of fun the first time which was 4 years ago and decided to go back and bring our friends with us. We had a group of 12. Got to the hotel expecting to be bumped from the rooms we ordered and it did happen. But because we had the mind set that this was not going to ruin our holiday, we went with the flow and ended up in the resort next door which is connected to this resort. Just across the street. Closer than going to the other end of the main hotel. We ended up with a double jacuzzi in our room, 2 double beds, huge bathroom and shower and a balcony with a hammock to lay on in the afternoon. The only thing was that the workers started work at 7:00 a.m. Didn't really bother us a bit. It was quite interesting actually. We watched them build this new hotel through the peek holes and were surprised to see the workers working in flip flops on their feet instead of steel toe boots. The resort is gorgeous and it is close to everything you can imagine. Close to 5th avenue if you are into shopping, close to the ferry to Cozumel or to Cancun if you wanted to go there for the day. You felt safe walking everywhere on the streets or on the beach by yourself. There was lots of choices for food. If you couldn't find something you liked, you are extremely picky. Lots of choose from. I enjoyed breakfasts the most because they would make omelets exactly how you wanted them with about 10-12 different choices to put in your omelets. Also the fresh fruit in the morning is great. Again lots to choose from. The people at the resort are so friendly and so helpful. They couldn't do enough for you. We got to know Iliana and David at the pool bar and also Jamie and Ivan at the restaurants. Also some other employees who also had a smile and a handshake or kiss in the morning whenever you saw them. They have added the Sports and Entertainment group since we were there 4 years ago. They sure get you involved in the Crazy Games everyday. Also they have bicycle tours of Playa del Carmen, Salsa dancing, water aerobics, Kareoke night and much much more. We had a great time with them and I think they enjoyed us including Senior Buck and Cowboy Bill. Weather was great while we were there. Sometimes cloudy but that was good to cool things down a little. The waves were great for body surfing but the water sure is salty. We also took one of the tours to Coba Jungle which I would recommend to anyone who wants to know some history about Mexico and also how the Mayan people live even today. Very interesting tour. It was all day but not real tiring except when we climbed the pyramids. I think that everyone in our party enjoyed themselves and I would not hesitate to back once again even with the mixup in the rooms. We ended up with better than we expected. You just have to have patience and the right frame of mind.

I had booked the new five star hotel being built next door, The Royal Porto Resort and Spa. I paid considerable dollars for this five star hotel. Unfortunately I paid upfront with Tansat and learned one week prior to departure that the new Royal Porto Hotel where I had booked was not yet ready for guests. I was offered an equivilant room at the Moon Palace which is much closer to the Airport and Cancun., which also included a day trip to Chichen Itza. I did not want this as I was looking forward to being in Playa del Carmen. I was not offered any compensation for this change. When I arrived in Cancun I was loaded onto a bus with only foreign speaking people, with me being the odd ball out. No one else from my flight was assigned to this bus. I was also told I was going to the Gran Porto Real. This was unacceptable to me as I had paid for a five star hotel and was now staying in a three star. (The Gran Porto calls themself a five star but many brochures say three and I think three is a more accurate rating) There was much new construction and renovations going on at the same time. I believe they are working on five stars but are at least a year or more away from that rating, and I believe this would only apply to the new Royal Porto Real. (Advertised but not available) However there was no hesitation to charge for a five star. I was given a junior suite on the beach and a black band to recognise me as a VIP. I found this to be a bit of a joke as my all inclusive treatment was the same as any other person staying there. I have no idea why I was given a black band instead of the usual yellow all inclusive band. I think the black band labeled me as a disgruntled visitor as I had expressed my dissatisfaction at all the changes. My room was far from the pool and lobby, however it faced the beach and had two balconies. Repairs were going on during my stay, with a tarp hanging onto one of the balconies, when I was going to sit out. The furniture is chipped and needed painting. The balcony railings had rusted out in places and in general the room needed refreshing. I would say the food is only average. I did not however eat in the separate restaurants. Reservations for these two restaurants was not always available and you had to line up in the morning at the concierge in order to get a reservation. The drinks were good and you could have more alcohol added if requested, however I felt some of the staff resented this with a look of same. I found most of the staff to be pleasant. I felt a reception for new guests would be useful, with drinks and food and introductions provided, as I did not find guests to be friendly at all. Little response was given to good morning greetings that I sent out. I had a wonderful massage on the beach, however U.S. coin tip was not welcome. The only other bill I had was a $10.00 U.S. bill which I gave her. I felt $5.00 would have been appropriate but of course not change. It is better to have some pesos available for tipping. I also had a very nice manicure at the spa. THIS HOTEL WAS OVERBOOKED TO SAY THE LEAST. One couple was put up in a room where the windows had been boarded up. Of course this was only for the first night???????? As I feel our vacation time is valuable, even one night of this kind of treatment is unacceptable. However once you are there, you have no recourse and of course they have your money. I found the beach area to be wonderful, although it could have been better maintained. They have a very large beautiful swimming pool and neat little bar close by. Repairs were being made during my stay at this bar as well as other areas. I understand this is necessary, but I do not believe I should have been charged for a five star hotel with all these canges in progress. All in all I certainly did not get what I paid for nor what I would expect with a five star cost, and I would not return without some compensation and or refund. I understand one airline that booked at this hotel compensated at least two of their passenges with a repeat reservation at the Gran Porto Real. They only have to pay their own air ticket. The people I booked through offered zip. As I said this hotel was very overbooked. A booking agent was there occasionally but she was not available upon my arrival. I received a note to tell me to be in a certain part of the hotel the next day at nine a.m. I did this but all she had the power to do was to change peoples room around. At any time that I did wish to see her she was unavailable. When she was available there was always ten people lined up to see her. Not a very satisfying situation. This was the same on a daily basis and I don't think anyone wants to spend their vacation time in a line up to see someone who is supposedly responsible for any difficulties you may encounter during your holiday, or so I thought. So I dicided to make the most of my dilemma with the way I was treated and enjoy the time I had there. Walking along Fifth Avenue was fun, lots of art, paintings and crafts. I was reluctant to try these restaurants. No information about them was provided by the hotel, and it was difficult to get close to the front desk as others also had problems to sort out. They really need a proper orientation for guests to make their arrival a pleasant and welcome experienc. The overbooking is so unfair to vacationers. I did visit one of the finished room just across the street (not on the beach which I had booked and paid for). The room was beautiful, but anyone staying there had to listen to construction sounds day and night and parts along with other construction inconveniences.

The new sister property next door is not complete but some people were put up there without any restaurant/bar facilities or working elevators. This means that they came to our side which made everything more crowded. Our room (Jr Suite) was very nice but the property design is not well thought out with a step down in the room from the foyer to the bedroom. There is also a step down into the shower for 12 (big). Little closet space. Food was fine but a buffet is a buffet and sometimes not very hot. The two sitdown restaurants were fine but they at first would only make a reservation for that day or the next. We were fine with that but midway throught the week they changed the rules so you could make multiple reservations for your entire stay. We were only able to eat at each once. We did go into Playa almost nightly and did have a couple of dinners there (on our own peso).

First off after reading reviews about getting bumped I contacted my travel agent, she in turn called the hotel direct to ask about this problem, and was told it only applied to people who booked online not thru an agent. Bull. We were on a charter flight everyone was thru an agent. 2 other couples that was on that flight and at that hotel got bumped next door. we were not (Maybe cuz the travel agent called?)

There were 11 of us girls traveling together from MN. We're high school friends celebrating our 40th birthdays this year. Two of the girls had stayed at the GPR last year and recommended it. After reading all the reviews over the last couple months, I was very leery of this resort. However, after our stay, I'd go back in a heartbeat. We booked junior suites (not oceanfront). Although we did have the token over-booking situation at check-in (3:30pm) and had to stay across the street our first night, we were moved the next morning and everything went smoothly from there on out. The new hotel is a LONG ways away from being complete. It's merely a shell right now. There are 3 floors (or 1 wing) that is on the street side that is complete. That's where we stayed our 1st night. They told us we were going to be the very first people to ever stay in our room. I have to admit, the room was stunning. If it weren't for the 6:30am construction wake-up call, we would have just stayed there and not moved. There was a large jacuzzi in the suite and beautiful updated decor. You really are just a quick cross of the street away from the main portion of the resort. I heard so many complaints on this site about the front desk staff. I did not find them to be rude what-so-ever. Just know, when you request to move, and they tell you verbally that you'll get to move, you may need to follow-up with that same worker at the front desk the next day. Isabel said we'd move and even wrote our names down. The next morning, a guy was there and he had no record of us and didn't want to help us. Then Isabel came out from the back and remembered us, our room # and where she was going to put us. Our next junior suite was on the main resort but street side, but you couldn't hear any construction though. We were pleased. With 11 of us traveling together, getting the lounge chairs in the morning was somewhat of a chore. But we always managed to get them. You find stray single chairs and just go round them up. The beach waiters even helped us. Thanks to Jorje! We weren't down there at the crack of dawn, by any means. More like 9am. As far as food, I concur with the other reviews on the Italian restaurant. It was the best food I've ever had in Mexico. I had filet mignon that was grilled to perfection. They greeted us with a pineapple martini. It was so nice in there. Maria Margaritas was just so-so. Most of our group did not like their food there. But I ordered the lobster (extra $14) and found it to be very good. Remember to get your dinner reservations in the morning. The buffet is great for omlettes and fresh fruit in the morning, great pasta bar in the evening. The beach snacks during the day are good. Highly recommend the guacomole and fresh salsa! Drinks are good too. However, if you're a top-shelf liquor person, bring your own bottle. Beer on tap is DosEques, which was good. The pool bar is fun along with nightly entertainment. If you want your drink stronger, just say \"make it strong\" or \"make it a double\". They will do it...no problem. I'm an all day drinker kind of person, so wouldn't ask for strong until the end of the day...or I'd never make it. :) As far as going into PDC, we loved the little quaint town. You can walk up & down the streets with drink in hand and take in the sights. Stop in and grab a beer from one of the stores for $1! We ate at the Blue Lobster in town one night and bypassed our AI priveledges. AWESOME!!! I never thought you could get such good food in MX. If you're young and into nightlife, we recommend the Blue Parrot. It's right on the beach, just a quick walk to the right of the resort. Swings around the bar, dance music until 5:30am, we were there every night! If you like salsa dancing or just want to watch it, go to the Mambo Cafe. My last compliment must go to the staff at the GPR. Luis, Julio, Sergio. They all took such wonderful care of us. Every day, they'd check in and see how we were and every night, one of them were out on the town with us. They'd watch our purses while we danced, escort us around, show us the fun spots, teach us salsa dancing, etc. We can not say enough about how wonderful they were. Yes, there were 11 women and that may have drawn a little more male attention. However, they were never anything less than perfectly polite. The wait staff at the bars, beach and buffet are all wonderful. My only reason for not giving this resort a 5 rating as excellent is the over-booking problem.

It is a beautiful resort, nicely laid out and always clean. The beach was wide and was generally clean, but the fisherman coming in with their catches were a bit of an eyesore as they gutted their fish right on the beach infront of the hotel. This beach was not ideal for swimming as I was told it is a dead Coral Reef and pretty rocky, although my daughters enjoyed boogy boarding on the days that it was rough. The beach was pretty busy, and I recommend that you get your towels the night before and put them out before you go for breakfast. We found the nicest place on the beach was North of the pool by the Breaksurf. It was quieter, and the breaksurf made for better swimming. I had heard a lot about the problems with overbooking at this resort, and even though I called my travel agent the day before to confirm that we were booked we were bumped across the street to the Royal Porto Real. This is supposed to be the higher class hotel but it is under construction from 7am-7pm and all the services are located across the street at the Gran Porto Real. My teenage daughters could not handle the early morning wake up call they received when the construction started and the smells from the paint were enough to make you faint. Luckily we were moved across the street the next night, and even though the rooms weren't as nice (the Rooms in the Royal Porto Real have jacuzzi tubs) we were much happier. The food at this resort was really dissappointing for a five star resort. The menu at the Mexican restaurant seemed a little Americanized and at the Italian restaurant we had undercooked pasta, and raw scampy. Although the flambe coffee they make is pretty impressive and tastey too. The buffet was even more dissapointing. Breakfast is the best meal of the day but they offered some strange choices as breakfast food (ie, Refried Beans.) The \"24 Hour Club\" only ever really had some pretty sad looking fruit and possibly a choice of some fried meat left over from lunch. The snack bar by the pool was repetitive and all the food had an unidentifiably after taste. Room Service was good sometimes but not consistent. The french Fries, I am informed by my daughters, are much better in room service than they are at the beach. Overall the staff at the Gran Port Real were excellent. We left a tip for our housekeeping and they left swans made out of towels covered in rose petals on our bed everyday. The waiter service on the beach was amazing. The employees work so hard to make sure you enjoy your stay you really don't mind tipping them, and I know they appreciate it because they make so little. The only bad thing I can say about the staff is that a few of them were a little too friendly to our daughters (ages 16 and 18). At one point they were afraid to leave their room for fear of running into this one employee that hounded them. They were there to relax and didn't enjoy getting hit on everytime they came down to the beach. I would definitely recommend the bicycle tour the hotel offers. You really see more of the surrounding area than you could see any other way and they even have police stopping traffic for you. Some of the sites included mayan ruins located near playa del carmen and a cenote. We enjoyed our stay but were not thoroughly impressed so we think in the future if we return to the Tiviera Maya we will stay somewhere else.", "Date": "February 1, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "4.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Winnipeg, Canada", "Title": "\u201cWas terrified\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR3099435", "Content": "We just returned from the Grand staying the Originally we had booked the Gran Porto sister hotel, the Royal Porto which was to be completed in October of 2004 and we were disapponted to find out that it would not be completed for our January stay. We were offered the Grand as a second choice. At this point it was too late to book another five star hotel and we have had several bad experiences with less than five star hotels. In fact we have been told that we are far too critical and act like spoiled princesses. After reading earlier reviews we were convinced that we would have a terrible time, but having no alternatives other than to stay home we we decided to go. So here is a short description of our week's stay.... First off, LOCATION, LOCATION...LOCATION. The Grand is located minutes away from fifth avenue and is located on a beautiful beach which rivals even the best beaches of Cuba and the Virgin Islands. Unlike many other resorts in the Mayan Rivera, you have many options to fill your day as the resort is located right in Playa Del Carmen. You can choose to soak up the sun by the pool or lie on the beach or take a short walk within town. The ferry to cozumel is a walk or five minute taxi ride and you can find wonderful shopping on fifth avenue. Rooms/Facilities We had a Junior suite (most of the resort is junior suites with a few standard rooms) and if we wanted we could have fit six people in our large shower. The room was large and spotless. The furniture is a little dated but fits the decor. I have stayed at five star resorts that are a little nicer and at five star resorts that are not as nice as the Grand. Do not have any reservations about the room. The mini bar was stocked daily without fail and if you required extra water, pop or beer, it was no problem. The pool was a reasonable size, very clean, a little cool but wonderful to sit beside. The resort is quite well laid out, quite compact, unlike many resorts where you walk for ten minutes to get anywhere. You leave your room, walk to the pool in less than a minute. The pool blends into the beautiful beach. Food I would rate this resort a ****1/2 star in most respects except for the food. As the resort is a little smaller (around 200 rooms), there are only two ala carte restaurants and one main buffet. They set up a lunch buffet on the beach. The Italian restuarant is very good, somewhat limited menu, but we enjoyed each dinner we ordered. The staff was wonderful in all restaurants, especially Joel and Maximo. A small tip is appreciated but not required (come on, you are on holidays spread the joy). The Mexican restaurant has a different menu each night and unfortunately one night, we did not want any of the selections. But every other night the food was good. The buffet is a little limited but we were able to find something good to eat on every visit. The breakfast offered omelets, fried eggs, waffles and many other choices. Overall food would be 3 out of 5 stars. Staff In our seven day all inclusive stay, we never had a bad experience with the staff of the Grand. Everyone went out of thier way to ensure our stay was wonderful. From check in to check out we were treated as pampered guests. No line ups or waits for the bars or restaurants. Beach service was attentive and again a small tip every once in a while went a long way. In our opinion, this resort is a true four 1/2 star allowing some latitude for the food. I would not hesitate to recommend this resort and would return again.

I too read all the reviews prior to and after booking and held my breath hoping all would go well and it did. We arrived on a Friday 1/21/05 and were there by noon and our room was ready! We booked an ocean front junior suite and got it. We never saw or overheard anyone who was bumped (not that it may not have happened). There were some people who were placed in the new hotel and weren't too happy as you have to cross the street to get to the beach, resturnats, etc. The staff was very accomidating. The food was very good for buffet. We never ate at the mex or italian rest as you needed to make resevations at least a day ahead of time and that was too structured for us. We ate in town a couple of times and suggest it even for the AI plans. Each day the buffet was different. I would suggest that they hire a chef that knows something about deserts. Only so many ways to fix custard. I wanted cheescake and chocolate!. The beaches are beautiful. You can walk into town and walk to the ferry dock via the beach if you like. This is our third time in the area and in the past stayed at the Eldorado Royale up the road a few miles (twice). In many ways this resort is much nicier. The staff is more attentive, the food much better, the beach and entertainment better also. The only draw back is the size of the hotel in comparison to the amount of beach frontage. I was used to a very spread out resort in the past and this is a little more crowded. You do have to get up at the crack of dawn to reserve your spot on the beach, at the pool or in the shade. If you like to shop, this is the resort for you. Every day we walked into town to shop or to have a drink, eat or just for a stroll. There are great resturants and wonderful shop keepers. We will definately be back next year.

The food (buffe) is great , alot to choose from. The italian restaurant is great. We didnt try the Mexican restaurant - heard that some people got sick after visiting there. The beach could be better.. a lot of fishing boats in the way - but i you walk 1-2 minutes to the east of the hotel, the beach is great there, and yes they serve drinks from the hotel even there.

We have stayed at the Ritz and Four Seasons and if you want glamour go there. This was our third trip to the Gran Porto Real in a year and a half. We have never been to the same destination more than once. We love the hotel and the area. We love the quantness and simplicity. We flew into Cancun each time, our transfers were prompt each time. This was the only time we have had to wait on a room and it was less than an hour. Each time we stayed in the Ocean front jr. suite, which is worth the difference in price. The first time we booked there we reserved a \"standard room\" which IS in the back. We quickly changed rooms. Spring for the OF or OV jr. suites. Rooms#249,349,251,351,253,353,255,355, some of the second floor OF rooms have palm tree obstruction. We have stayed 5 nites each time and the food was very adequate. I can see that if you stayed much longer it could get repeticious. Some guests don't realize that there is an Italian rest. in the hotel also. Be sure to eat there, it is our favorite. Make your reservations with \"Elsey\" the conceigne. Since our first visit they have improved the beach in front of the hotel. Yes, they are building an addition (actually a whole new hotel) and yes, if you stay on the construction side it would be noisy. We loved the fact that the ferry to Cozumel is a short walk and only $9 US. It leaves every hour on the hour and is a great trip, takes about 25 mins. sailing time and docks right in town. You can shop there and go to the national park to snorkle(take a taxi or rent a scooter), again about a $10 entrance fee to the park. The town of Playa Del Carmen is only two blocks from the hotel. This is a cobblestone/brick street which is blocked off to traffic and has shop after shop and restaurant after restaurant (if you get tired of the hotel food). We walked there every nite. On our previous trips we rented a car and drove to Cancun where you can go to the \"sister\" hotel and eat if you like. Wouldn't want to stay there, too congested. We have also been to Xcaret and Xel Ha. Xel Ha is our favorite. It is a natural water park and is beautiful and very clean. Great for tubing and snorkeling. My husband says it's the best snorkeling he has seen and we have been to the Carribbean, Hawaii, Bermuda and the Mediteranian. The price there was $29, basic (which is what we did, ask one of the restaurant staff to fix you box lunches) or $56 for all inclusive. It's a short drive, 35 mins., straight shot. We rented a car in town, American car rental, which was a short walk from the hotel. The last time we rented from Thrifty, again a few blocks. The hotel staff was very nice we had several favorites, Manuel and Fernando in the dining rooms. The hotel manager, Nicolas was great.

This worked for us both. The all inclusive family joined us at a few of our favorite spots on occasion (Media Luna, La Siesta, Hemingways, Byblos) to break the monotony. Those who complain about the repetitive food at an all inclusive should venture out & try some excellent local restaurants! Staff at GPR was great, very attuned to service. Very nice, accommodating to any of our requests. A small tip here and there goes a long, long way. Enjoyed the activities around the pool. Would I stay there again?

They immediately pulled us aside to talk with the concierge who tries to talk you into taking one of their other hotels 45 miles up the road in Cancun until they can get a room available, which we did not agree to. You know the routine if you have read any of the other hotel reviews at this web site. Due to no other reasonable option we agreed to relocating for the night to The Reef on Coco Beach about a half a mile down the beach. Not a bad alternative considering you really don\u2019t have a hotel to stay in since the one you made reservations at is not letting you stay. While we were walking out of the hotel, there was another family just finding out that they too were without a hotel room at the Porto Real. The front desk arranged a hotel van take us to the Reef hotel and handed us a card with the Porto Real phone number on it, and told us to call them in the morning and they would come back over to pick us up. The next day when we called to request their van to pick us up, they told me they were too busy for the van and that we should get a taxi\u2026oh did I mention that there we six of us plus luggage? Oh what the heck get two taxi\u2019s, you\u2019re on vacation.

It also makes you distrust others that you come in contact with due to their lack of professionalism and honesty. On the positive side, the employees are very nice people and really strive to make your stay enjoyable.

About 2 weeks before we left, I called the hotel directly and spoke to the front desk manager and explained my concerns. He reassured me that I wouldn't be bumped and left a note on their computer system not to move us. Nevertheless, we had NO problem when we checked in. We booked a standard room and were perhaps going to upgrade to a junior suite once we checked the room first. We were originally told that the standard rooms only had 2 double beds but we asked if there were any king beds in standard rooms and of course, there were 2 rooms available. We ended up keeping our standard room with the king bed but I would definitly recommend the ocean view junior suite (we went to have a look in one when the maids were cleaning and they looked absolutely beautiful!!!) The problem we encountered with our room was the noise from the \"so-called quiet\" pool and all the noise with the construction from the new hotel. The noise was my only complaint with the hotel. Food: The food was just fine and the drinks were good. We enjoyed Il Pascatore (Italian) most. We didn't even try the Mexican restaurant because we didn't like the menu. The buffet was also fine. We enjoyed it more for breakfast. We mostly had lunch on the beach (burgers, hot dogs, nachos, chicken etc.) I was really impressed with the beautiful grounds and the constant upkeep and cleanliness - the hotel is very pretty!! I was also very impressed the the pleasant and very friendly employees. Beach/Pool: The beach was beautiful and the weather was perfect. I cannot comment too much on the pool because we only used it for about an hour (we are beach lovers!!!) It looked busy and noisy. Chairs are pretty much reserved by 8 am - you have to get there early if you want a chair. All in all, we had a great time at the GPR. The absolute best thing about the hotel is the amazing location. We loved strolling up and down 5th avenue in the evening. It was very romantic!!!!! I don't think I would return only because I would love to try the many other beautiful resorts in the Mayan. I would recommend it though. Don't listen to the bad reviews - go with an open mind. If you want a luxiourious hotel, this is not for you. It's a \"middle of the road\" resort. The only suggestion is to call ahead and confirm your reservation because this hotel is quite famous for overbooking.

Common areas are very beautiful. Our room (junior suite) was spacious, but a bit run down. Makes a nice first impression, but when you start to look around you see some shabbiness -- cracked and stained fixutres in bath, pathced walls, etc. There is a safe in the room, but you have to ask for a lock at the front desk and they don't have enough for all rooms. We had to go on a waiting list to lock our valuables. You must wear a wristband, even if you are not on the all-inclusive plan. Security guards won't let you enter the hotel w/o a wristband. Ours were put on fairly loosely, and we figured out how to slip our hands out of them (using a lot of hand lotion) when we went out, and put them back on before returning. This got easier toward the end of the week as the wristband started to stretch a bit. Pool area is nice, but not enough chairs in the shade. Everyone goes down early and puts towels on chairs to \"reserve\" them. You don't have a chance of getting a chair if you don't do this too. There is also a second \"quiet\" pool on the top floor. Very hard to find. Shady and quiet, with a swim-up bar. If you like a lot of activity around the pool, this probably isn't for you, but if you just want a quiet place to sit and read its quite nice. Very shallow, calm water near the beach -- excellent for poor swimmers and children. If you like a lot of wave action, you're going to have to venture pretty far out. Forget about the hotel restaurants. They try to make them exclusive by requiring reservations 24 hours in advance, but there are LOTS of great restaurants with better food within a few blocks. Hotel staff will try to encourage you to get the all-inclusive plan when you check in, and you kind of get ignored by waiters and bartenders if you don't have it, but we just didn't find the price worth it.

We decided to stay here as it was one of the only nice hotels in PDC on the beach and close to 5th. I was quite hesitant to book at this hotel after reading some of the reviews but we enjoyed our stay and we would recommend this hotel. We brought our 10 month old infant and so we chose to eat from the buffet at the main restaurant for all of our meals. The food was relatively good and the service was excellent. There was a hot grill where you could order pancakes/eggs/omeletes etc for breakfast or quesadillas/etc for dinner. The waiters were all very friendly. Some of the waiters gave us flowers that they had created from coconut leaves. My only suggestion to improve the hotel would be to change the lunch and dinner buffet options more frequently as they tend to be a little repetitive. Unfortunately, we didn't get an opportunity to try the other restaurants in the hotel. We booked a Junior Suite - Ocean View. Our original room that we were assigned was on the street (construction) side of the hotel and it was close enough to the beach that we had a decent view of the ocean. The hotel next door is almost finished and there was no construction noise or disruptions. That hotel is for overbooked guests until they completely finish it. We decided, nonetheless, to ask for a room change. We provided the front desk the next morning with the room numbers of a room that we that we wanted and we were able to get one of them. Our 2nd floor room was large, clean and it had an excellent view of the beach. The maids were very friendly and they cleaned our room every day. They made cute designs from some extra towels that we had for our child. The likelihood of getting a room with a full ocean view diminishes the later in the day you check in. If you arrive in the evening you may end up at the hotel next door for the night. You can always move rooms if you don't like the one you're assigned. The beach was large and excellent for swimming. There are some boats next to the edge of the hotel that you can charter to go fishing. They do not affect swimming. There were always quite a few people swimming in the ocean. Guests reserve the beach chairs early in the morning by putting their hotel beach blanket on it. The pool has an activity hut that plays music. The pool staff coordinate activities like valleyball, aerobics etc for a good part of the late morning/afternoon.

Yes there may be a few kinks but go with the flow... you are on vacation!!! I drove myself crazy reading all the reveiws of Gran Porto. So I guess it is now my duty to give an honest (and brief) review. Gran Porto is in the perfect location of Playa Del Carmen. It is not a huge hotel in comparison to the monstrous resorts , but it is the biggest of the hotels right off of 5th Avenue the \"Main Street\" (for tourists) in Playa. 5th avenue has lots of great bars and restauraunts of various sizes and styles with live music. There are also a lot of shops, if you feel like you are being hassled by vendors, just say \"No Gracias\" and keep walking. The Beach is beautiful without question. The fishing boats that dock to right of the hotel are quaint and clean. They float in crystal blue water and leave PLENTY of room for swimming. The hotel is also in a great spot for activities like Xcaret ecological park, Cozumel (the ferry is a short walk from the hotel), Tulum ruins, and Xel-Ha (cave snorkeling). If you are up for the 2.5 hour trip, go to Chichen-Itza ruins with the Mayan and Aztec Pyramids. They are amazing and worth the time. Don't just park yourself on a lounge chair, get out and experience Mexico. I suggest renting a car instead of doing a tour so you can be on your own schedule. For me I do not like huge resorts so the size was perfect, but of course this does lead to problem of overbooking. The hotel does need to monitor the problem of guests reserving lounge chairs and leaving for hours. If you have to go to the hotel across the street, it is still under construction but I was told rooms are very nice with big Jacuzzis. Make sure to ask for a third floor room that FACES OUTWARD. Skip the Mexican restaurant at the hotel and go to a Mexican restaurant on 5th Ave. I went with my best friend and the hotel is not really for singles looking for a non-stop party, but you can still have a lot of fun! the entertainment staff will take anyone who is up for it out on the town in Playa or Cancun (only 40 minutes away). I went to Coco Bongo in Cancun and Mambo Cafe in Playa and had a great time with some really friendly, outgoing people. Unfortunately missed the famous Blue Parrot bar. If you go, say HI to Ruben, Tavo, Luis and the ladies of the activities crew, they work very hard to make sure everyone has a good time!!!!

We requested an upper floor ocean view room, and got the upper floor, but we could only see the ocean if we looked out the bathroom window! Found out the reason they overbook this hotel is they are trying to fill up their other less popular hotels. Had several offers to stay for last 2 nights at one of their resorts in Cancun. We went and looked at it one day, and it didn't compare to this one, so we declined. We would have liked a junior suite, but didn't want to pay the extra price. Our regular room was a little small but manageable. Our only real complaint about the room was its proximity to the so called \"sports bar\". It was not that at all. It was actually their venue for nightly entertainment, and because it was open air, the noise was quite loud in our room. We go to bed early, but the noise was so loud until 10 pm every night, it was impossible to go to bed before then. We never checked out the actual entertainment, so can't comment on that, but it sure was loud! We thought the resort itself was beautiful. Lots of palm trees, and palapas on the beach. Yes you did have to get up early and put towels on the chairs to claim a good spot, but we got in the habit of doing this every day and it wasn't a problem. We preferred the area to the extreme left, by the beach bar. The waiters there were awesome and really appreciated the tips we gave them. We enjoyed all our meals at both the specialty restaurants and the buffet. Our only complaint about the buffet was they only had one 4 slice toaster, and there was quite a line up every morning if you wanted to make your own toast. On our last day, they had an industrial rotating one, so that problem has been solved. We were able to eat in both specialty restaurants several times, as there was no limit. You just had to make your reservations the day before. The service and presentation of the food in both of them was spectacular. We only had one slow waiter the whole time and I think it was because he was new. We liked the proximity to 5th avenue and walked there several times to the internet cafe and shops. The only thing that will spoil this hotel in the future is the new pier they have built. It will apparently be used as a tender spot for cruise ships as well as a sailing point for the ferry to Cozumel. It will bring so many more people to the area it will spoil it. We liked the relax pool on the 3rd floor, and the waiter there Philipe was awesome! It only gets sun in the morning though, so there weren't too many people there later in the day. They don't have a problem if you bring your sports mugs - they will fill them with whatever you want! We enjoyed sitting in the bar over the main pool every evening after dinner to have a drink. We also really enjoyed eating some of our meals in the garden outside the buffet restaurant - a nice little touch. We only had a few dealings with the front desk and I must say they weren't too eager to help. I did see lots of people upset about the overbooking thing, and wanting better rooms. The staff there seemed uninterested in helping them though. The VIP room is a little plus if you want a drink or snack in the middle of the night, as it's self serve. There are a couple of pool tables in the hotel, but you have to pay 15 pesos for each game. We thought that was a little high, considering it's only a buck or so in Canada. Oh well, if that's all I have to complain about - not too bad!! We loved the place and if the new pier doesn't spoil it too much, will be going back next year.

The rooms, although spacious, seemed over the top in decor, a bit on the gaudy side. Kind of like a theme hotel in Vegas. They were decorated in busy faux finish, wall paper borders, different bright Mexican tiles, & bright painted multicolored furnishings. The a-la-carte restaraunts were booked the first night so we had to eat buffet which was pretty scary. The wait staff was not too friendly, unless of course, you leave good tips. There were live shows going on just outside the buffet restaraunt, so again, pretty noisy. Two of us got quite sick after eating here during our stay. Maybe it was all the flies that kept flying around, since it was sort-of and open air buffet. Not too smart. The pool area was very pretty, as well as the beach, but the music and the activities were so noisy. Oh and they only let you check out 1 towel at a time on your \"personal\" towel card, and if you lose yours, they charge you $30us. (for a worn out frayed towel?). I complained about this at the front desk and got attitude from them, stating that the towel service and cards are a privelidge, blah blah blah. I am just used to better service. It is not a lot to ask to be kind to your guests. I am not even a big complainer! And, this is not a cheap hotel by all means. There was a lobby- type bar with not so friendly wait staff and bartender. Guests were either dressed in their swim attire, or sparkling sequin gowns as if on a low budget cruise (hey this is Mexico!). Overall, this hotel is fine- if you like a noisy/busy compact resort, so-so service, and below average buffet food. It is a very clean and well kept up resort though. I also like the location. Just walking distance to many great shops and restaraunts. I just think the property was not set up quite right for what type of people they are trying to attract. It just didn't fit. Also, the spa is very nice, and has a menthol vapor steam room, sauna, jacuzzi and a cold plunge pool. Their new construction across the street looks like it will be more promising when finished. Oh- and when they overbook, you will probably get a room in the construction zone across the street. Although those rooms were beautiful and have private jacuzzis, and much more tasteful decor, it's still a construction zone.", "Date": "December 1, 2004"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "2.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Seattle, WA", "Title": "\u201cI should have gone to Hawaii....\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR2855832", "Content": "I should have read the reviews on Trip Advisor before allowing my travel agent to book my stay at the Gran Porto Real.

Rudeness will get you no where. We chose the non exclusive because there are so many good restaurants in town. Alot has changed since I was there 6 years ago (like the prices ha!). In all of these reviews (except my single friend below) did anyONE ever mention these plastic bracelets we have to wear to \"identify\" us as resort guests. Well I can understand if we were all inclusive but we weren't . I think they put them on us so the time share vultures could identify us as well. Actually, we were never approached by any and probably cause we slipped our bracelets off and carried them in our pockets only to be bothered by the \" resort commandos\" positioned at every corner of the hotel, they use hi tech walkie talkies so don't think you are in the clear if you get by one of them. You couldn't get 10 feet near the resortt if you didn't have that bracelet. Incidentally, for you cheapos who think you can sneak someone in your room FORGET IT!

Our group consisted of 3 families (6 adults and 6 small children). We chose this hotel, as it had the type of amenities we were looking for - cribs, refrigeration, pool,etc. When we arrived at the hotel, we were bumped for the first 2 nights (out of 5), due to serious overbooking. The problem was they are building an adjacent sister hotel with 200 rooms which were supposed to be completed, and only 57 of these rooms were done. This problem will be ongoing until the new hotel is finished. They placed us in a decent alternate resort (about 10 miles outside of PDC), and provided all the transportation, but it was quite a hassle, as traveling with small kids is not easy to begin with and we really did not want to switch hotels mid-trip. They also gave us a voucher for a future free 3 night stay, to be used within a year (but not valid during the high seasons). Despite this initial hassle, the portion of the trip spent at the Gran Porto Real was great. The hotel is beautiful and the service was very good. We had a couple of minor problems in the room, and they were attended to in a very prompt manner.

The Staff here is what keeps the place in business. Everyone from the front desk, to the waiters, to the bartenders are all extremely polite and curteous. We rolled in at 3pm on our check-in day and were greeted at the front door by a bellman who escorted us to the front desk and then to our ocean view junior suite. I had read a post earlier about tipping heavy early on, and it worked. I stepped out of the van with 20 or so ones in my hand subtly of course. We had no problems checking in or with our room. when we got to our room, we were literally 40 feet form the ocean. we were ocean front on the first floor. beautiful view, except the fat europeans in the speedos...whole other post. The room was huge with a king bed and a \"mini-bar\" (2 cokes 2 beers some mango juice and 2 waters) the shower was large enough for 4 or five people. And my wife loves a firm mattress, so we were thrilled with the room and the service so far. Heres the BAD... There are 3 restaurants there. Italian, Mexican, and Buffet. There is a sportsbar listed on expedia and the hotel website, but it was never open while we were there. For the mexican and italian places you have to make reservations a day in advance. the italian is decent at best. serving recycled food, and a complimentary crap martini when you walk in the door. My wife and I are both bartenders, and we couldnt find a decent mixed drink in the whole resort, so we were stuck with fail safe frozen margaritas. The mexican restaurant served something that resembled golden retreiver prime rib. We even gave it the benefit of the doubt and ate there twice. Even worse the second time. Thirdly, the buffet is the only place that you can just drop in. It is un airconditioned, as are most common areas of resorts in Mexico, however, the food was all at or around room temp. The same old items were there every day and i swear they were 2-3 days old at times. There is a buffet on the beach for lunch during the day, but it sonsists of soggy fried delicacies such as cheap fries, fish quesadillas, what seemed to be grade D hamburgers, some sort of meat product hot dogs, and occasionally, a fried round thing that resembled a squash, yet tasted like rancid pudding. The pool was fairly dirty and had a horendous odor to it. The beachfront was obstructed by tons of fishing boats as is most of the city. The glasses that everyone in the resort was drinking from were never washed only dipped in sanitizer. Rarely did i get a drink without lipstick or sunscreen on my glass form someone else. The television setup they had was screwy, none of the channels matched the guided that they provided on screen, they had every major american network except CBS? our maid didnt show up until the 3rd day we were there. we realized, that she was coming in and checking the little tip envelope to see if we tipped her and then leaving if we didnt. Sure enough, we left 50 pesos in the envelope and our room was magically cleaned after our return from the beach. the next day another 50 pesos...another clean room. the following day, we left nothing as an experiment. We didnt have a clean room again for the rest of the trip. According to the hotel and the travel websites, tipping is part of your price, however, it is highly expected on top of what you pay and will result in poor service and in some cases no service. like i said i am a bartender and have no problem tipping well for good service, however, tipping here is almost a prerequisite to get anything accomplished. We did get a note under our door the first day to come to the front desk where they had a welcome honeymoon package. we arrive and they shuffle us to a desk where a woman wants to give us a timeshare presentation for a free bottle of cheap tequila. we politely said nothanks. the next day we gety a flyer in our door and it is requesting us to stay in their newer hotel across the street for the remainder of our trip at a a much lower price. so apparently, the room shifting scam is prevalant and we had prime real estate in our suite. We had prepaid for the trip anyway, so we werent about to move rooms much less across the street. OVERALL: the resort is beautiful, the rooms are spacious and accomodating. The staff is extra friendly, but they all expect to be tipped for everything. The food is horrible and would make me stay away from this resort ever again. The loaction is prime for playa.

It was the first time my husband had ever been to Mexico and I was really excited to show him the beautiful water of the Carribean! We were married at the Ritz-Carlton on Maui, which we adore, but it is very different from the Carribean. I had researched the hotel a little bit and found mixed reviews on this sight. We felt we had to stay there since we were part of the wedding party and didn't know anything else in the area. I had read on tripadvisor that the hotel had a reputation of switching your room when you checked in and not giving you the one you booked. Concerned about this, I asked the bride, who assured me that her travel agent had a personal relationship with the hotel and this wouldn't happen. Sure enough, we check-in, having booked and ocean front junior suite with a king bed, and they said there were none available but we could try to switch rooms the next day. We went to the room they assigned us and found it facing the ocean but the view completely blocked by trees and it was also located directly above the main restaurant, very noisy. With two double beds, we figured we'd make due until the next morning. There were no room service menus or hotel guides in our room, and it was missing a lot of little things. We decided it was not big deal for one night but soon discovered when we went to bed that evening that the pillows were ROCK hard and the bedding atrocious. The next morning we went to the front desk to see about switching and they said we weren't on the list. The man who had checked us is never mentioned anything about needing to be on a list. At this point we thought it may be futile to try and switch, but the bride's father said if we kept bothering the people at the front desk, we'd get switched. After 3 different trips to the front desk, we were \"magically\" switched to a room on the opposite end of the hotel (still the old wing if you've been there) to a room with a king bed and beautiful view. We were quite thrilled and tipped the desk lady accordingly. That's the other thing, they say don't worry about tipping on the all-inclusive plan, but that's a crock. I guess you don't \"have to\" but it really gave us a superior level of attention with the waiters and housekeepers. Back to the new room; we began to notice all of the items the 1st room they had given us was missing by everything that the 2nd room had. The mini-bar in each room as described on the website is only a TINY little refrigerator with a couple of Cokes, Beers, and bottled waters in it. The room service was fast though but had a very limited menu. The food at the hotel was terrible unless you had a waiter who loved you and had fresh french fries and quesadillas and stuff made fresh for you! The buffet is the mainstay and you have to make reservations at the Mexican or Italian (total joke) restaurants which are booked 2 days in advance. Having no experience with an all-inclusive, I knew not to expect too much of the food, but it was terrible. My husband ordered a steak in the Italian restaurant and it was charred to a crisp. If you are still reading at this point, which maybe you are not (he he he, this got really long!) the wedding was also a joke at this hotel. It was located in this \"breezeway\" where we couldn't do a rehearsal because somebody was having a massage. Random. There was nobody from the hotel there to help with the rehearsal either. Having been completely spoiled by the wedding department at the Ritz-Carlton in Maui, this wedding department was nothing more than a \"we provide the place and you do everything else\". My husband and I were SO dissapointed that we had spent time and money on this place for a vacation that we checked out a day early and spent our last night at the Ritz-Carlton Cancun for the same price. Given, it wasn't all-inclusive, but who cares? The service, room, and facilities were truly first class. One other room side note, our friends who were also there for the wedding had a room in the new part of the hotel accross the street. Not only was this extremely inconvenient, there was construction every day all day that was very loud. And this construction was not down the street or anything, it was accross the hall. The hotel opened a half-finished portion of its hotel while the other half is being worked on. In conclusion, if you are the kind of traveler who prefers service, excellent accomodations, and great food, this is not the place for you. The ONLY place we will be staying if we go back to Mexico is the Ritz in Cancun.

I had seen the reviews of the oceanview suites on the second floor so when we were told that's where our room was I instantly told the man at the front desk that we wanted a new room and he told me there wouldn't be any available until the next day. Well 4 days later, after making 2 daily trips to the front desk, we grabbed Hilda from Olympus tours and took her to the front desk with us. She helped out a lot and we were in a new room on the third floor 5 days into our trip. But of course it was a room with 2 double beds because that's all that they said was available!!

We had a Jr Suite and did the AI plan. My thoughts on the value of AI are that it was a good deal for us as drinkers. For those who don't drink it might not be such a deal. The restaurants were good, not great (plus there are so many places in walking distance on 5th Ave to check out). The service was always top notch however. Check-in: We had read a number of reviews about over-booking and were quite concerned. Thankfully our worries did not materialize. One item to note: You can and should ask to be switched to an alternate room if they try to put you in a room facing the new hotel construction across the street. We had to do that as the initial room they put us was directly facing construction. If you've never been to Mexico/Playa before, keep in mind that the price of nearly EVERYTHING is negotiable. Taxi's, meals, handmade goods, even the boat to Cozumel! And at the GPR, you will be amazed at the service you get if you're willing to tip a few bucks here & there. (case in point, I gave our waiter at Maria Margarita a $5 US tip and he practically begged us to have dinner there again and to ask for him to be our server) The timeshare people: Yes they are there. No they aren't horrible or pushy. They asked us to go view a property but we declined. No harm done and no big deal really. The beach: The truth is the beach directly in front of the main pool is not great as it is narrow and there are boats tied right there. But as was noted by several other reviewers, if you go to the left it is much nicer and quieter as well. Length of stay: 4 full days was not long enough. I plan to go back again and next trip will definitely be a full week at least. Conclusion: We loved the GPR and would enthusiastically recommend to all. We met some great people there (Amanda who posted on 10/17 - we met several members of the wedding party. Doc & Carol who were also on their honeymoon) The service at GPR is fantastic.

The room service menu could use more variety though. However, this is onw of the most beautiful resorts in Playa del Carmen at a resonable price. The staff truely makes you feel at home.

They said they didn't have us on their list after we previously paid so we had to pay a second time. It was like pulling teeth from both Best Day and Hotels to get either one to reimburse but finally they did. The food was terrible. Breakfast was by far the best meal since you could have omlettes and that such made. The Italian restaurant was the best food although again I would not call it great. Definitely find some local spots to eat! The hotel was overbooked by Thursday and lots of unhappy people in the lobby. We opted to do the two for one location transfer and stayed in Cancun for a couple of days (see review of Gran Caribe Real). The resort itself is absolutely beautiful and I highly suggest spending time at the upstairs pool (Filipe was a wonderful bartender) if you want to escape the MTV beachhouse atmosphere at the main pool.

The mini bar is free and room service once a day is free as well. The service from the staff throughout the hotel is top notch. I had read about the over booking problems but I didn't not witnesses any upset guests or fights at the front desk. Several people from my group has stayed at 6 star hotels and were amazed at how beautiful GPR was. Please remember that this is Mexico not a ritzy 5 star in LA or New York. The hotel is a 5 star based on its apperance and up keep but the lack of resturants and bars would make it a 3. We saw people daily painting or trimming bushes, someone was always working to make sure the hotel was top notch. We all went All Inclusive and was the best route. Unless you do not drink at all and do not hardly eat its worth it. Even when you travel into town the food is moderatly priced, this is a touristy area, and they know people will pay high prices. The beach is wonderful, if you walk towards the north about 500 yards the beach is not as crowded and has its own bar. There is a swim up bar pool on the 3rd floor of the hotel that seems to be the best kept secret. If you consider yourself high maintenence this place is not for you. The alcohol was free flowing and was not watered down and the staff was not constantly asking for tips. I have read horror stories about the timeshare people but no one in my group or many people I talked to had even been bothered with them. The wedding went off without a hitch it was absolutely beautiful, there was not a dry eye in the house. The hotel is 1 block from 5th Avenue the shopping center. There are a ton of resturants and nice shopping. Overal I highly recommend this hotel and will be going back next year.

Everyone is busy fixing or cleaning at ALL times, no time to goof-off here. Food was not very good, and this is my 65th trip to Mex. and 16th time at an all-inclusive, so I know. I would not choose the A/I here, there are to many excellent Restaurants on the beach and in town. The Taco wagons are ALWAYS a good bet. I don't think I would recommend this hotel, they really weren't very helpful, there is no swim-up bar down stairs, the stools at the pool bar were so high you could not sit at the bar ( on purpose, I'm sure).

Having read the reviews, I was a bit apprehensive, so here are my thoughts, written admittedly from a European point of view. We booked our stay and transfers on the web through Best Day Tours, purely by chance, as they offered the best rates. This was a masterstroke because they are associated with the hotel and there is always a rep on site if you have problems. We had booked a junior suite with ocean view. When we arrived, we were told that there were only 2 suites available and did we want to be on the first or second floor. We said second, and were taken along by Javier, who was very nice. As we went in, he said he didn\u2019t think we would like the room and he was right. It was around the corner from the sea and faced the half finished new building. He phoned the front desk and we went to look at the first floor room. This was better but not what we wanted, so we agreed to stay there for 1 night and moved the next day. We were then given a very nice room overlooking the beach. helpful. Fortunately it did not overlook the pool, which was very, very noisy during the day. Moral \u2013 if you don\u2019t like the room, ask nicely and they will find you one that you do like. The front desk people are not rude, but they do not go out of their way to be helpful. Yes there are boats drawn up on the beach, but one of Playa\u2019s claims to fame is that it tries to maintain some of the fishing village atmosphere and that means boats. It is not trying to be Cancun, thank goodness. There is no high rise building at all. There is a perfectly good sandy beach at one end of the frontage. The sand is always cool by the way; it is made of fossils not silica. The new building is still not finished, although there didn\u2019t seem to be much work going on when we were there. Some of the rooms are being used however. I would describe the food as unimaginative. There is plenty of it and the Italian restaurant is by far the best. The Mexican one has no atmosphere and the food was somewhat badly cooked and not even Mexican much of the time. The buffet restaurant needs a new head chef. The food is just bland. The staff are all delightful, from Eva (a guy) at the north beach bar, who taught us some Mayan words, to Luis and Allejandro in the Italian restaurant, who does magic tricks and now know that you call a female customer \u201cMadam\u201d and not \u201cLady\u201d! I must admit I was surprised at the rude way some of the guests treated the staff. They are not slaves.

Just a short walk around the corner the beach is fantastic but less shade and no beds so take your pick. The arrivals desk was not partcularly welcoming and the noise coming from the 'Entertainment' at the bar made us feel as though we had made a dreadful mistake. The room cheered us up though and the sea veiw was magnificent. The pool area is also nice but unusable as there are always 'games' taking place and the noise is deafening.I suppose that happens at all inclusive resorts where people are drinking from 9.00am! We stayed away from the pool and at the beach which was almost perfect except for the days when the beach bar had their music system on and we had true stereo from the pool area in one ear and the beach bar in the other. We didnt get the all inclusive which was perfect as it makes you get out and the restaurants and bars locally were really good.

Our trip to Playa was a great first-time experience in Mexico. We can not wait to get back. We had read ALL of the reviews on the Porto Real and were a little concerned. However, all worries were put to rest upon arrival. We booked an Ocean-view (Highly recommended) Junior Suite. Upon arrival we did indeed have what we booked except for the fact that we had 2 double beds. We requested and were put in another Ocean-View Junior Suite with a King bed the next morning. (The Hammock on the balcony was Great!!) Don't get me wrong, the 2 double beds were nice, but we didn't go to Mexico for our 16th Anniversary to sleep in separate beds. The King was MUCH better. Hey, I guess size does matter. Now for the reason that I'm rating it a four and not a five: The front desk personnel were not quite what would be expected from a 5-Star Resort. They should be a LITTLE more friendlier at the front desk. And the food at the buffet was not quite what it should be either. I HIGHLY recommend that you enjoy a dinner at Il Pascatore, the Italian restaurant. It was fabulous!! The service was outstanding. We did not particularly enjoy Maria Margarita's, the Mexican restaurant. We did get room service for dinner one evening and it was okay. The only other bad (if you call it that) thing was that ridiculous bracelet that they make the All-inclusive people wear. It is kind of annoying. Plus, when you do venture into town, it makes you a target for the tour operators/time-share folks. We did get talked in to visiting another Real property accross town by someone working at the VIP desk inside the hotel lobby. We asked all questions BEFORE we went....like....Will this cost us anything???...the answer was no....How much money do we need to bring???.....Answer, none.....Is this a Time-share venture thing????.....Answer, No.....She stated the only stipulation was to be Married, and have a credit card....Hmmm Credit Card????....Don't worry, they only look at it and do not write the number down....Well, we went on the Tour of the other hotel.....Turns out that we were indeed taken on a Timeshare tour....They all say that \"This is not timeshare\"....but if you've been on one timeshare venture, you've been on 'em all....Five minutes into the tour, my wife and I knew what we were in for....Once asked if we were interested in buying into the 'Vacation Package' (Not timeshare???) we simply said 'NO\"....there was absolutely no pressure put on us. Now the good part....For going on the hour-long tour we received $1000.00 Pesos (Roughly $100.00 U.S. dollars), 2 Mexican blankets, and a bottle of Tequila, oh and free transportation to and from...we used the $$$ on 5th Ave. to buy souvenirs. Next time I go, I'm going to leave the wife and daughter on the beach and I'm going to hit everyone of these things and see just how much money I can make in a day..LOL....Easiest $100 we've made....Believe me, you WILL be asked plenty of times to go on these little TOURS....Just take the money and go...Something for the guy to do while the others stay on the Beach all day....LOL...Here's a tip: If you get tired of being asked to go on these tours, (and you'll be asked out on the street) simply say that it is your last day there....Then, they will know that you don't have time...It worked like a charm for us out on the Avenue.... We enjoyed our time on the beach everyday at the end of the hotel....a place called North Beach....we always got a chair right by the bar (and you don't need to get up early to find a beach chair....and Guadaloupe (the waitress) was absolutely amazing....and the bartender there was the best at the resort....They took real good care of us....It was just like living in a Corona beer commercial....sippin' on drinks and looking at the aquamarine waters of the western Carribean. Make sure you at least make a day trip over to Cozumel...Use your binoculars to make sure no cruise ships are over there before you head to the ferry....Ferry is very quick and costs roughly $18 U.S. per person/round trip...If there's a cruise ship over there, chances are that you WILL NOT get any bargains while shopping for souvenirs. Plus it will be crowded. By the way, the shopping in Playa on 5th AVE. is EXCELLENT....we enjoyed it... We will DEFINITELY go back to Playa, and will not consider staying anywhere else but the Gran Porto Real. We enjoyed our stay and wish we were there now.

We needn't have worried at all! We booked two standard rooms which are of adequate size and nice decor. Trouble was, my mother is disabled and these rooms are a long walk from the elevator. As a result we asked to be moved to rooms by the elevator (which turned about to be Jr Suites) so we had to pay a $20USD upgrade fee per night for each room. Must admit that it was worth it for the extra space and room for us to put a crib in. The double beds were a bid on the small side though. We met some people who were staying in rooms in the new hotel across the street which is not finished yet. They said that their room was huge with a lovely king bed and jucuzzi in the middle. The staff at the GPR cannot be faulted in any way. They were fantastic and nothing is too much trouble for them. They are so friendly and willing to help and you knew they weren't just doing it for the tip. As mentioned before, do take a wad of $1 bills with you as these people really deserve the service they give you (especially Jorge, the pool waiter)! My 4 year old daughter was very disappointed with the kids club. Not only did it reek of mould and damp but, as they were hardly any kids there, they didn't seem enthusiastic about doing anything with my daughter. Maybe it's better when there are more kids there but I definitely wouldn't recommend it. The pool area was lovely but it was a shame about the constant influx of \"loud, crassy, drunken Americans\". It really did spoil the atmosphere a bit and a lot of people by the pool (including all the other Americans) were a bit annoyed about it. These weren't young, party people either but groups of middle aged couples that really should know better. And talk about belitting the waiters!!! I'm not a beach person but I wouldn't say it was perfect - more adequate. The view is not lovely with the huge sand bags and there was a bit of a pong on some days with dead fish along the shore. The biggest nightmare for us was the humidity there. Only the rooms have A/C which meant that you were sweating into your meal every time you ate. Our 10 month baby really couldn't cope with this and he was fussy all holiday. IF you want somewhere with nice rooms and excellent service, then this is the place to go.

We had stayed in Cancun two years ago. I remembered how wonderful I thought Playa Del Carmen was(not to mention the fact that it was much less touristy than Cancun-No Wallmarts, malls and JCpenneys here). So this is why we picked the Gran Porto Real. I loved the architecture of the hotel and the fact that it had character and charm, so unlike the modern hotels on the Cancun Hotel Zone. I definitely felt like I was in Mexico, from the pillared balconies to the Talavera Pottery they put in the room. One suggestion I have if you stay here, definitely book an Ocean Veiw Suite on the 2nd or 3rd floor, it is well worth it. We originally booked a junior suite, and they put us in a room overlooking the new hotel wing they are building. You don't go on vacation to look at a construction site. They ended up giving us an upgrade for half the upgrade price and we had a beautiful view of the ocean. Eating breakfast on the balcony or sipping wine while you watch the sunset is definitely worth getting this room. Personally I would suggest unless you are on a budget, not to get the all inclusive. It's not that the food or service is bad, but you've got so many terriffic restaurants within walking distance of the hotel, it doesn't make sense to be limited to only 3. We actually had the all inclusive, and appreciated it because we were on a budget and definitely got our money's worth. Especially since you could get one meal a day room service. But the restaurants on 5th avenue are really great and so much variety from Brazillian Steak houses to Italian to places that service Lobster and Filet Mignon with a lot of ambience and atmosphere to boot. It just depends on how much you have to splurge and how much you like to get out and explore instead of staying at the hotel. We actually ate on 5th avenue a couple of times anyway and I think we still came out ahead. We ordered room service for breakfast every day. The only terrible thing we had at the hotel was Prime Rib!!! You could have thrown that at someone and split their head open, it was so tough. But that was not the norm, all the rest of the food we had at the Mexican and Italian restaurant was good. The hotel staff were very nice and attentive. I made sure to bring a wad of $1 bills for tips as well. We tipped very well there, I saw a lot of people that didn't bother to leave anything which is rude. Excellent service should always be rewarded. Plus they definitely act even more attentive and nice than they already were!!! haha. One other tip I wanted to pass on: Don't act like the \"ugly american\" here. I saw too many people doing that and getting nowhere. People respond much better to respect and kindness. Also: Make sure to put your \"Do not Disturb\" sign on the door, unless you want to be awakened several times by the maid trying to clean your room at 7 am. I didn't really see anything too bad about the beach. It was fun to take a walk down to the less isolated areas of the beach and explore. We were able to swim there and lie out under a straw thatch hut. If you don't like the beach, you can drive along highway 307 and find some really cool isolated beach spots as well. Whatever you do or whatever your preference, I think you'll end up having a good time here. I would go back again. I would most definitely pick this over the Cancun Hotel Zone.

Our room was great (had Jr suite), shower was huge, decent terrace, mini-bar stocked everyday, awesome A/C. Bed was hard but maybe you like a hard mattress:) Staff was friendly, hard-working and as mentioned in other reviews a couple dollar tip is appreciated by the workers and goes a long way. The pool area was very nice, big pool, some fun activites ( water vollyball, aerobics, ect), just get a chair before 8:30-9:00am or you will be on the beach. The beach is ok, a bit rocky, if thats a bother to you, just walk a little ways down and it smoothes out. There are the fishing boats docked but you get use to them, at times when the fisherman came in, you sometimes got a whiff of the morning catch but hey, they have to make a living:) The food at buffet was good, not great, remember your in Mexico, everything is just a bit different. The buffets get a little redundant after awhile but if thats the case, you can try the 2 restrurants attached to the resort (the italian being the better IMO) Just make reservations the day before. The lunch buffet on beach is great if just in mood for old fashioned hamburger and fries. Drinks were great, will make them how you want. The 5th avenue shopping strip was a cool, amusing little place. If you do not like to be slightly pestered to look in stores, don't go. If you buy stuff, talk them down, never accept the 1st or even second price they gave you, seemed to me they would ask at least 3x more then what you actually end up buying it for, especially silver. A few tour operators work out of there, so there are things to do off the resort if you want to pay. We went to Xel-Ha and if you like to snorkle, great place to do it. Overall it was a great experience, not a 5 star place, and not for people that like to look for things to complain about.

Our favorite was Teresa who seems to serve mostly in the bar area by the pool. She was wonderful and very friendly. We never had an empty glass. Tipping is not expected but we found very much appreciated. The Hotel was absolutely beautiful and the rooms were very spacious. We unfortunately, were there during the passing of Hurrincane Ivan which forced the hotel to shut down beach and pool access and the activities crews tried to entertain everyone. This was not the most memorable part of our trip as most everything within walking distance was closed down. We would not go again during hurricane season as we were left with little to do for one entire day.

I must admit that I was hesitant when booking this hotel as I had read all the bad reviews. I traveled to Playa Del Carmen on 9/11/04 to 9/18/04. Upon arrival, I was pleasantly surprised by how beautiful this hotel was. The rooms are very clean!! Never found one bug! I've stayed at some of the most beautiful hotels such as the Ritz Carlton and Bellagio in Vegas, so I know what a nice hotel looks like. Gran Porto Real was about \"almost\" as good as it can get in a location right on the beach. Don't expect too much as most hotels on the beach are not as classy, due to the sand. The rooms had nice soft beds, high ceilings and great working air conditioner. The service was also pretty good. Always attentive when any problems arose. The atmosphere was very lively and they had entertainment every night which was nice. I looked at almost all the hotels on Playa and saw no other one to compare. Most of the other hotels that pop up when searching are not in Playa, but in nearby towns. You want a hotel in Playa because you are at walking distance from the main walking strip called 5th Avenue. Also I cannot say much as to the food as I didn't have the all inclusive. I did notice that lunch always consisted of hamburgers, hot dogs and taquitos. As far as the beach, it was nice and clean, but one day a cruise ship came off shore and brought in tons of dirt and seaweed. Dirtied the beach. So, I can see why some people said the beach wasn't nice. I was lucky enough to experience a nice side of it as the cruise ship came a few days after my arrival. Word of advise, when going to the beach, stear off to your left. The ocean is clearer and nicer, but just a little rockier. The left side has a small stretch of sand bags that stop the waves from comming through, so the water is nice. Great for snorkleing in the mornings. Although I was pretty happy with my stay, there were some negatives. Upon arrival, the customer service in the front desk was not what should be expected in a hotel that claims to be a 5 star (I would rate it a 4). They tried to charge us a pretty high amount to add a person compared to the original price quoted upon booking. We were able to lower it after requesting to speak to the manager and insisting we get a lower rate. We also realized that we didn't have an ocean view, but were also able to bargain for one. Be respective, but firm with your requests. Do not get a room that has no ocean view. You will get a street view, not a garden one. Also, I didn't see any standard rooms, they may have been across the street on a newer building. I wouldn't purchase a standard room. Another negative was the fact that the cable paused on us more than a few times at night. But, by far the most negative part of this hotel was the wrist band situation. They make you wear this band that you cannot take off. It's so annoying and not reflective of what you expect from a high class hotel. They want to make sure you don't have extra people in your rooms. I hated being stalked when walking to my car with luggage. We had to do so a couple of times, as we left overnight. The bell men hounded us. They wanted to make sure we were not leaving for good, so they ask all these questions. In all, I would stay here again. Just hope they work on their customer service a bit.

We found out that the reason there was not much of a beach was from erosion due to previous tides/hurricanes. But they are working to build it back up.

We wanted to stay at a nice hotel with good amenities that was right in Playa del Carmen, and the GPR met those requirements. The rooms were clean (we didn't see any bugs), the staff was extremely friendly and helpful, and the food was good. The location is great and we enjoyed walking, biking, and running in town. The GPR has a good sized swimming pool by the beach (divided in halves - one for activities and one for just swimming/lounging), and another pool on the other side of the hotel with a swim up bar. We had a lot of activities planned (two days of SCUBA diving, a snorkling trip, and a packaged tour of Tulum and Xel-Ha) so we didn't spend all of our time at the hotel. It's kind of a stretch to call the GPR a \"resort\"; it has nice pools and the food is good, but I don't think we could have spent all of our time there without leaving the grounds. Words to the wise: The hotel advertised free use of their sunfish sailboats, and I was really looking forward to doing some sailing. However, the sub-contractor that ran the concession - \"Aqua World\" - wasn't as excited to put me on the water because I wasn't a paying customer. (The attendant said that I could only use the boat for a half hour, and when I was done, he made a point to press me for a tip.) The trip to Tulum/Xel Ha was great, but be mindful that Xel Ha sells tickets that are all inclusive (five restaurants, secure lockers, towels, free drinks, etc.) and basic (park entry only). Be sure you get the one you want. We got our money's worth out of the all inclusive package at the GPR, but make sure you try some meals out in town - there are some really good restaurants on 5th Avenue.

The kids got the former for the night! We weren't in the master suite long, but it provided a wonderful respite after a full day's travel, and the morning off the three baclony's overlooking the Carribbean made for some excellent pictures. We moved into the rooms we reserved later the first day, and they were just fine. In fact, the junior suite was excellent. The view off the balcony was over the back of the kitchen area and an alley way, but 90% of the view as jungle with houses popping up through it, so it was really rather quaint. Our teens' standard room was immediately adjacent to the more secluded and smaller third-floor pool on the street side of the hotel. The room was too small for four adults to enjoy much time in, but the kids liked it a lot. Food was very good (buffet) to excellent (Il Pescatore). Wait staff in all eating and bar areas were outstanding. You can tell that these people really appreciate having their jobs and genuinely like working with people. They respond graciously to tips we would consider average to below average in the states. (Ask for Pasqual at Il Pescatore.) The pool was marvelous. Never too crowded. Warm, but cool enough to relax from the hot sun and wet air. The view from the south end of the pool is beautiful, and it is the more relaxed end of the pool, as well. It's easy to claim most any set of poolside chairs you want prior to 7:00 a.m. And that is really perhaps the most beautiful time of day at the pool. On our last day when I went out at 6:30 to grab our five favorite seats, I look up and saw the Carnival cruise ship Elation anchored about 1 mile directly offshore of our hotel. It was a marvelous site. The beach is not fashionable. It is narrow in front of the property, the shallows are rocky, and the entire shoreline from Gran Porto to the ferry pier is crowded with fishing boats. But this gave us a sense of Playa's fishing village origins and made for a strong local flavor. We didn't mind the conditions of the beaches at all. North of the hotel a half block begins a long stretch of beach that most people would consider what they're looking for. It was nice. Our time at Gran Porto Real went too fast. The hotel is ideal for families, honeymooners, other couples, and even groups of singles who want a more laid back, not too party-hardy atmosphere (if you want the latter just walk up the beach 100 yards).

I figured we would get the run around with the rooms when we checked in that most of the other reviews stated, and sure enough we did. they still gave us a junior suite, but facing the construction. no big deal it was beautiful, and we did not care, we got their around 8:00pm, and by 9:15 the next morning, we were moved and upgraded (because of the honeymoon) to an oceanfront, junior suite that was just perfect!!!! the weather was hot, hot, hot, but no rain, so we dealt with it! the food was so, so, but when you are feeding that many people, you cannot expect too much. the Italian restaurant that you have to make reservations for was the best! awesome food, and service! jose was the best waiter there!!! i am not a coffee drinker at all, but you have to order the spanish coffee. if not for the drink, for the show, put it this way, it involves fire, and was so neat!!! we had no problems making reservations, and maybe had to change the time we wanted by 15 minutes, again, no big deal. we did not visit the other mexican restaurant that you had to make reservations for, we never heard good reviews when we were done there, but i cannot judge since we did not eat there. we spent most of the time up in the pool bar and met some wonderful people that we hope to stay in contact with. plan on tipping (if you feel they deserve it) they state it is included (if you go with the all inclusive) but we alays tipped our waiter at the italian restaurant, and also the bartendars (if we used them for a few drinks) but that was about it.

Upon arriving we were not given our ocean front room either but were upgraded to a master suite with a jacuzzi the first night-non ocean view.My parents were put far down the hall at the end of the hotel and my sister was put at the hotel next door.with a jacuzzi in her room also. We did however receive the most beautiful ocean view rooms overlooking the gorgeous pool area, the next day at 11am. They were nice enough to keep us close together,(my sisters's family and my parents were with us) We all got ocean view rooms close to each other. THis hotel obviously overbooks and my guess is it is first come first serve, we arrived late at 9pm(problem with our flight) If we had arrived earlier maybe we would have gotten our correct room initially. ROOMS_____THis hotel is beautiful, the rooms are clean and beautifully decorated. Even the hallways are beautiful POOL___ THe pool area was fantastic, there are shallow ledges where you can lay in your lounge chair and the waiters,waitresses will bring drinks right to you. THE water was very very warm at least 90 degrees. FOOD___The food was excellent for breakfast and lunch but dinner was not what we are used to. THe breakfast buffet had an assortment of delicious fresh ripe fruits, cereal,sweet rolls,croissants,french toast,scrambled eggs,bacon sausage, also the had made to order omelets and pancakes. Lunch had a huge salad bar,all veggies and fruits-bring your favorite salad dressing and keep it in your minifridge in your room.they also had chicken ,fish,meat in chafing dishes all very good and on some days had freshly prepared tortillas and mexican chcken, delicious. DInner as I said was not great, The fish was good.lobster(surcharge) was good. we had excellent filet mignon once-the other nights it was not good. food presentation was very pretty. 5th avenue has some nice restaurants we wished we had tried instead. ALL INCLUSIVE VS. NON ---If we went back we would consider not all inclusive and just pay for breakfast or lunch each day and go out to dinner at night. 15 dollars U.S. breakfast,and 18 dollars for lunch. DRINKS__ THe drinks tasted good but were a little weak,but if you ask they will give you more alcohol-no problem, just tip them a dollar. Bring lots of singles with you. They don't have corona,but they have dos equis which was fine with us. THE BEACH-THe beach as you already know from the reviews had boats docked and you have to walk over some rocks in the water,but the beach at the new hotel they are building next door is beautiful. Just walk over there and don't bring valuables because there is unlimited access to the beach,there were some locals there and my sunglasses are gone now. I still don't know who took them-it could have been some other tourist at the hotel. Who knows. THe hotel next door is under construction-looks like it will be fabulous. SNORKELING_ we went to xcaret we did the underground river and snorkeled-lots of fish at the snorkel site,not in the river, but no coral. It was 50dollars plus 12 dollars for snorkel equip. rental. It cost 8 dollars to take a cab there. Go on your own don't pay the 79 for the tour.THis way you can come back when you want to. THEn we snorkled again,down the beach the abyss dive shop offers a 1 hour snorkel trip for 20 dollars-well worth it. MY RECOMMENDATION__ Would I go back? probably ,but I would possibly try not all inclusive,and eat dinner in town-I guess it depends how much you drink. It might pay to go all inclusive and just skip dinner and pay for dinner in town a few nights as you still might wind up ahead that way. IF you want a gorgeous hotel this is the place if you don't mind walking to the beach next door. It was fun going to walk on 5th ave at night to shop and look at all of the restaurants. NO AIR CONDITIONING IN RESTAURANTS--- BY the way, the restaurants are not air conditioned. They told us the italian one was and it was a bit cooler there but the doors and windows were open when we were there and the air was not on. I was fine with it, but my parents were uncomfortably warm.

I could go on forever, so I\u2019ll just summarize: Front Desk / Reception: 3/10 The only reason I don\u2019t give them a \u20180\u2019 is because of the amount of abuse these employees take on a daily basis, i.e. We reserved a Jr. Suite w/ ocean view 6 MONTHS IN ADVANCE through Funjet. We also brought nearly 60 guests to the hotel for our wedding. But does this matter . . . NO. We still got downgraded our first night (plus they tried to put us in a room with twin beds!) & ended up bunking with my in-laws who were also bumped upon there arrival at midnight. Yes, I should have expected it, but the hotel/event manager (Walter) had our guest list well in advance & assured me that all of our guests\u2019 reservations would be honored. In the end, nearly every single member of our wedding party was bumped to Bananas their first night or had to change rooms at least once. The confusion & anger caused by the VERY DELIBERATE & CALCULATED business strategy of the hotel management completely ruined my first day of vacation. They must make a killing shifting $300+/night hotel guests to a lesser hotel & merely tossing them a frozen lobster & massage in return. Luckily, our guests saved their frustration for the hotel & didn't blame us for our choice. Warning: Our Best Man booked his room through Expedia & they denied any knowledge of the reservation, forcing them to pony up for the reservation they already paid for. Another source of contention, I gave the concierge a folder with itineraries for newly arrived guests. She said she would take care of it, but when our guests asked about them, she had no idea. I guess they were promptly thrown away. Hotel Accomodations: 9/10 The hotel itself is gorgeous. The rooms are beautifully decorated and spacious. I even thought the \u2018standard\u2019 rooms were quite nice. The mustiness is to be expected in such a humid climate. Just bring Benadryl & leave your patio door/window cracked if possible to allow fresh air to circulate. The pool is terrific. Never too crowded during our stay. Activities all day, but easy to tune out from the other side of the pool. Best is the keg trolley. Nothing better than dozing on the beach & having someone push a cold beer into your hand! I had no problem with the beach. Kayaking was fun, plus the beach less than 100 yards north or south is pristine & free of boats. Restaurants: (8/10) Overall, I thought the food was great. The buffet varied daily & always had a terrific spread of fresh tropical fruits & veggies. The reservation restaurants were also quite nice, although I would pass on the lobster \u2013 obviously frozen & overcooked. Room service in the morning was the best \u2013 what a treat! As for watering down drinks, I never saw any evidence of this. Plus, how would you manage to drink all day on the beach with stiff drinks. The only problem is there seems to be a need for a system to handle non-AI guests. One of my friends ended up paying $11 for a hotdog at the beach grill & was treated rather shabbily. Employees: 9/10 All employees are extremely kind & helpful. Although they appreciate the tips, they never hover as in some resorts. We simply gave out good tips in the beginning & were well taken care of the rest of our stay. Wedding Services: 7/10 Patti was very helpful, but is stretched too thin from what I gather. We were not given the option of a rehearsal (which was difficult with the size of our wedding party) so had to handle it ourselves, and also felt a bit rushed through the planning process. The flowers, champagne, etc. were nice, but still felt contrived. The photographer & DJ were terrific, though. Bottom Line: They do A LOT of weddings at the GPR (we had to take a different route back to the reception after pictures since another wedding had started exactly 1 hour after ours). If you just want a standard, factory-issue wedding in the tropics, this is great. But if you want a larger wedding, with any personal touches, I\u2019d suggest going somewhere else. In the end, I think that Chris & I would return to the Gran Porto. Yes, I was sorely disappointed with the handling of the reservations, & it did create an enormous amount of stress for me in the days leading up to the wedding. But if it were just the two of us, I think I could have handled being bumped one day. All in all the pros of Playa & the GPR well outweigh the cons \u2013 you just have to decide whether you & your travel partners are a good fit.

We were very concerned about the many reports we had heard of the hotel overbooking so we contacted our online travel agent and insisted that they give us some assurance that we would get the room we paid for and threatened to refuse payment in the event they gave us any trouble. We got an email confirmation from the hotel and fortunately checked in without any problem. In fact the reservation slip at the hotel had \u201cno movar\u201d written across the top! We highly recommend this strategy for anyone concerned. The room\u2014a ocean view junior suite\u2014was beautiful! Lots of character, wonderful ocean and pool view. We overheard people in the standard room complaining about the small size and calling it an \u201cairplane bathroom\u201d. The upgrade is well worth it. The room was not too noisy except for one night when there was a pool side wedding at the hotel, but they shut down the music at 11pm sharp, so it didn\u2019t cause too much sleep disruption. Definitely take the ocean view. There was indeed lots of construction at their new hotel across the street. They claim it is opening in July, but it looks about 10% complete so I would assume there will be loud construction for quite some time on that side of the hotel. If you\u2019re considering staying at the new hotel \u2013 DON\u2019T! As for the beach, it is quite small and not the ideal place for spending time in the water. That said, it\u2019s very picturesque with lots of fishing boats. Just 1min walk on the other side of the hotel is a wonderful beach. We did NOT do the all-inclusive. In fact, we made out much better. They charge about $60/pp per day for the all-inclusive option. We found it much cheaper and the food much better and much more exciting to go out and explore the town and different restaurants. We rented a car at the airport and really enjoyed having the flexibility of a car. The ride from Cancun to PDC was really easy. A 4 lane highway runs from Cancun down to Tulum. The highway is smooth and the resorts, towns and parks are clearly marked. DO NOT USE THRIFTY. We are fighting with them now as they attempted to rip us off. They claim that by law you have to pay a required $7/day liability charge that\u2019s in addition to the price you pay to book, even if you book through Orbitz. Reality is that only THRIFTY charges this to unsuspecting tourists. No one else does this so use another rental company. Gas is about $2/gallon. We spent a morning in Tulum (approx 45 minute dirve from PDC) and then an afternoon at Yal-Ku Lagoon in Akumal. The fee at Tulum was about $3pp and Akumal was $6 per person but rental costs were additional \u2013 well worth it, probably the best snorkeling anywhere! There were tons of parrot fish and some people even saw turtles. We spent another morning in Coba (approx 1-1 \u00bd hrs from PDC). On the way back we stopped at Grand Cenote which was wonderful but expensive $8 per person\u2014despite the name, this place is quite small, but well worth it with crystal clear water, caves to explore and cliffs to jump off of. We also spent a day in Xel Ha. It was very expensive $29 per person without any rental equipment. The snorkeling was great although the water was kind of cloudy. We saw tons of fish but no coral. Finding lunch was extremely frustrating - you are limited to a few restaurants in the park and the lines were long ALL afternoon \u2013 bring your own food! The Town of PDC is definitely NOT undiscovered. It\u2019s like walking down 5th avenue of NYC with shops, restaurants and hosts constantly nagging you to come into their restaurant. One good thing \u2013 everything is negotiable, even your meal. You can negotiate easily for free drinks and sometimes even on price, especially for the fish of the day. Prices are NOT cheap \u2013 they price everything on normal American meal costs. As an ex jewelry retailer in the states I can honestly say that the silver in PDC is a rip-off. You\u2019ll do better at Macy\u2019s for price and quality. RESTAURANTS \u2013 in general everything on 5th Ave is overpriced. If you are willing to explore 10th and 15th Ave you\u2019ll find some great bargains. Don't worry about what you eat, the places along 5th Ave. all use filtered water. Even the hotel had bottled water in the hallway. 100% Natural \u2013 trendy place focused on lots of fruits, oatmeal and neat juice concoctions. You sit outside in a pseudo rainforest. Major breakfast spot. Food was good, not great but they definitely charged tourist prices. Service was horrible! Hot! - great place for a quick breakfast. Very reasonable prices. Fresh bread cooked on the premises. Banana bread loaf was average, but the Hot Muffin sandwich with egg, cheese and Ham for $2 was awesome! There are two locations so it\u2019s convenient from either side of the strip. Ajua \u2013 on 4th st between 5th and 10th ave. Fun place for dinner. Food was really good and the American owner is there every night to meet and greet and eat. The waiters are highly entertaining and personable. The live music is a great touch (although it ends at 9pm sharp). Drinks were overpriced, but the meal was great! We had fish and steak. The steak was among the best we\u2019ve ever had anywhere and it was cheap! Agora\u201410th Ave\u2014excellent Italian seafood and pasta!! Good prices! Great drinks! THIS PLACE IS A MUST STOP! Beware that portion sizes are VERY small so order appetizers! Frida Bar\u2014great drinks and excellent banana flamb\u00e9!! Really cool atmosphere in a hidden outdoor area. Fancy-looking place with NYC / Mexico mix. Prices were reasonable. Los Rancheros \u2013 On 5th ave between 4th and 6th. This place has the best view of any restaurant in PDC on a roof-top overlooking the ocean. That alone is probably worth the trip at night. Too hot to go during the day b/c you\u2019ll bake on the roof. The food was nothing to get excited about. The drinks were great and big and reasonable. Try the Spanish Sangria! Caribbean Paradise Hotel bar-corner of Ave Constitutionales and 5th Ave\u2014okay food. nothing special. Good prices. Skip it. Bip Bip-corner of Ave Constitutionales and 5th Ave\u2014Outstanding lime soup and tacos. Good prices. Friendly service. Would have frequented this place if we had discovered it before our last day. Perfect spot to grab lunch and then get back to the beach. La Parilla - don\u2019t get fooled by the crowds. This is a chain and the food suffers expectedly. Below average food, but fairly cheap. The Lime soup was really good actually. Although we\u2019d like to say the banana flamb\u00e9 was good \u2013 definitely go to Frida bar instead for desert. Brazilian Steak House \u2013 For those of you who\u2019ve never been to a brazilian steak house, this is a MUST. For those of you who have, you\u2019ll understand that at $18/pp you can\u2019t pass this up! The food was great and the service outstanding. Bring your appetite! Caf\u00e9 Tropical \u2013 for breakfast it was decent. The much touted smoothies didn\u2019t strike me as anything special, but for about $2.50 each they were a good value for their size. They have a nice 2nd floor which overlooks 5th ave.

Afterward, we were glad we didn't stay there. It appears to be the most exclusive place in Playa del Carmen until you see it up close. This resort seems to cater to a 20s and 30s party crowd who may not be particular about the quality of food or drink at this all-you-can-eat and drink resort. It's entirely possible that these hotel guests haven't experienced a truly exclusive resort before. Immediately adjacent to the beautiful beach-front rooms and balconies, Rock and Roll music blasts all day from huge speakers next to the pool, as well as next to beach chairs/umbrellas. The volley ball area is right in front of the beach chairs and umbrellas. If you want a peaceful beach experience you must walk 1/4 mile or more down the beach. The wedding reception we attended blared rock and roll music untill 11PM immediately in front of the hotel. A romantic walk along the promenade, by the pool, or on the beach, or a peaceful sleep was impossible. Unlike most of the beach in Playa and other areas, the beach in front of the hotel is very narrow, which exacerbates the problems. It's littered with seaweed and the water murky from the moored fishing boats bobbing up and down all day stirring up the water. Yes, it's a beach and some of this might be expected, however, after years of beach vacations around the world, this is one of the dirtiest beaches I've seen - up close in front of this \"exclusive resort.\" The meals we ate (including salads and filet) were plain and bland and similar to cafeteria food. The local village restaurants on the other hand had outstanding and creative food. The drinks at the Porto Real were frozen and lacked distinctive taste. They reminded us of the frozen drinks you get at a fast food place from one of those machines that turns around all day; if you order a name-brand drink you pay extra; the service was slow. The inside of the hotel, while open and beautiful, is formal looking, very stuffy and hot. The overabundance of grounds staff was insultingly obnoxious and suspicious, of anyone who wasn't staying there. I saw five stars over the Grand Porto Real name on their sign. If it's a five-star resort, it feels as if they aren't used to five-star clientele. It looks classy on the surface, but the food, treatment and atmosphere are not five star.

I had read people's comments & was quite nervous about going, but I had already paid for my trip in advance & couldn't cancel. For starters, the hotel is beautiful. There is plenty of ambiance & I did like the beach (despite the fishing boats). Compared to Cancun & Isla Mujeres, the surf was that perfect in-between: not too tranquil & not too rough. No doubt about it, Playa del Carmen has the best beach I've experienced. Our room wasn't ready, so we had a temporary room. We booked an ocean-view junior-suite, but the temp room was on the 2nd floor, so there was only a view of the pool & a large palm tree. I think it was room 264. Anyways, the ceiling had a leak & no one came to investigate, even though we made 2 calls. As a side note, if you asked for an ocean-view room, make sure it's on the 3rd floor! We were all-inclusive, so there were no complaints about the mini bar; a bottle of Orange Fanta did the trick on a hot night. Because our room wasn't ready, we were promised a 50 minute massage, which was then demoted into a 25 minute massage. Supposedly, the person at the front desk made an error. While I was debating with the desk assistant, I witnessed multiple parties of people being relocated because of overbooking. Our television service was inconsistent and we kept having problems with the balcony lights, so I gave up trying to read at night. As for the food, the restaurant Maria Margarita is tops. The buffet at the Albatross is good for only 1 thing, the produce! Their melons, mangos, etc. were very ripe & the veggies were good; no fruit flies or anything. The food was generally bland, but a little seasoning did the trick. I would stay away from the buffet desserts...far away. There was plenty of hospitality, all the way. Their activities were mediocre. I think that they are an exceptional establishment, but they promise too much & are unable to deliver. On a final note, my friend & I noticed the utter lack of diversity at the hotel. It could be the time that we were there (June 14-17), but we did not see any Asians & I was the only African American. I have Asian friends & African American friends; I know that we travel, but apparently, the Gran Porto Real was not on the \"to visit\" list. Because of my Latino family I was able to communicate with the hotel staff, so I felt welcome by them, as for the other hotel guests, my friend & I were glad to leave because the stares were often cold & chilly. If you decide to go, you might have a great time, but be prepared for anything, it's a real bag of tricks! No worries here, since I do not plan to return there.

The strange thing about this hotel the elevator does not even go up to the fifth floor so you have to walk up two flights of stairs get to the fifth floor where our friends room was. I felt the staff was less than desirable. The bell boys were nice and Modesto at the upper pool was great. The restuarants were not that great and were miserably hot. I hate to sound so negative and gripey but this vacation was a surprise for my husaband and and we were both very disappointed. I would not go back even if they gave me a free trip.

There was a group of 20 that went down for my wedding(April 15th). The wedding co-ordinator Patty was fabulous and had nothing to worry about. All my guests had a great time and not a single complaint among the group. As for the negative reviews, I must admit I think those people are a little picky. Remember its not the Taj Mahal. My wife and I are 31 and 27 respectively with no kids. This may aid in your decision knowing from what view point this review is from. Our group ranged from 21 - 55 and all had the same opinion about the hotel. GREAT Hotel-It is gorgeus to much to say about decor. So I'll just say beautiful The Beach- It was great they cleaned off the seaweed the first day we were there and I never saw any greenery on the beach for the next three weeks. There were a few rocks under the water, but its the ocean. Next people will complain that there were fish in the water. The boats added to the Mexican Flavor. Talk with the locals out front to take you fishing. Four can go for the day for about $65 US total if you go through a charter some were asking 65$ Us per person. Front Desk- Yes they are rude. I did hear of overbooking, but it was for only one night and those guests got a free massage. Ladies, my wife said they massages are great. You are barely in your room the first night anyways. My group all had standard rooms, we payed for a junior suite and due to the wedding we were upgraded for free to an ocean view. Yes you can fit 10 people in a shower Staff- Service is next to none. The staff is fantastic. We really got know the staff because of our long stay. Jorge (Hor-Hay) is the greatest. He even bought us a wedding present. Talking with staff we found out that they make approx. $6.00 US a day. TIP it won't kill you, and the fantastic service is even better. Many of the people in our party work as servers or bartenders. They all admitted they would be fired in five minutes. Goes to show how hard working and friendly the staff is. Food & Beverage- The Buffet changes every day of the week and then repeats itself the following week. As stated 3-weeks of the same food, and we don't have a single complaint . We never ate out once, during our stay. The All Inclusive is worth the money. The Mexican Rest. was good but the Italian Rest. is the best. Don't forget the Ceasar salad. Guys when it comes to booze, if its not strong enough just ask for more. Canadian Boys, sorry no Crown Royal only JD. I did bartended in whenI was younger and NO! they don't water down the alcohol. They go through bottles like crazy and you can see them being opened right in front of you. It's easy to see the seels have not been cracked prior. Games Staff- They were great. volley ball / bike tours / tequilla water volleyball / relay races / bochi ball / yoga 5th Ave. - Wow! shop around and bargain, take your time there is always a better deal. We found that most of our purchases were 30-50% less then the listed price. The clubs- Dance until you drop Captain Tutiks and Blue parrot are party hardy. $20 US for all you can drink wrist bands or pay $6.00 US per drink. Excursions - Rent a Jeep and drive to Chitzen Itza, its normally about $80.00 US/person for a tour. Four of us went and it worked out to $55/couple for the car rental and entry fee. The drive is half the fun and you can stop along the way in all the little towns to shop, a whole lot cheaper. TAKE A MAP. Go to Cozumel and rent scooters and tour the island. Its nice to go at your own pace and the deserted beaches are amazing you can look for miles down and not see a sole. ***TIPS*** Don't lose your safe key. Its $125.00 US to replace. OOPS! (Yes for one little key / good scam) My wife almost didn't marry me. She divorced me when we got back because I found it in the bottom of my suitcase. Well, no divorce but close. When they say stay out of the pools after 11pm every night, because of chemicals. Make sure you listen its not a ploy to keep you out of the water and from making noise. Just ask my buddies about the slight skin irratation Watch the hospitality staff. It is a time share WAKE-UP. Many places prefer US$ to Pesoes / it was 10 pesoes for every US$ (EG. buy an item at 20US so logic is 200pesoes / wrong the price then becomes 230 pesoes / pay in US) for us Canadians we get screwed no matter what. We went through Air Transat / Christine the Rep. down there was great and assisted us with anything we needed or had questions about. If you have booking issues take her to the front desk with you. I saw her in action, trust me the people got the room they paid for. Guys go golfing at playa car. $95US after 2pm includes cart / drinks (yes beer) and food (sandwiches and chips) club rentals are $25 US BRING your own balls / I suggest a dozen. I normally shoot 85-90 on 18. I lost count and only had one ball left at the end of the round. The pro shop failed to tell us about two-steppers (a snake / get bit, two steps and dead) DON'T go in the bush to look for your balls. We had a couple little mexican grounds crew almost have heartattcks when the watched us walk in to the trees. They came running and screaming to advise us about the snakes.

We didn't notice the construction at all. Yes, there are boats and seaweed on the beach, but it didn't interfere with me laying under a palapa and reading a book. Just north of the resort, across the pier, is the same beach without boats. Some friends of our paid one of the fisherman to take them out for 2 hours and caught a marlin. The next day he took them out again to snorkel on a reef. We were on the All-Inclusive plan and loved it. My husband put his wallet in the room safe and left it there.

This posting includes a couple of other hotel choices, things to do, and tourist scams to look out for: Gran Porto Real: is beautiful and right next to a nice pier, water, beach. This hotel is walking distance to the quaint SMALL town of playa del carmen. The town streets are paved with some type of brick material...beautiful. The hotel pool is small, but right on next to the beach. This hotel has a great view of sunrises in the morning. This is the best looking hotel there is in the actual city of playa del carmen! This is a kid friendly hotel (and those with out kids will enjoy it as well) If you are going to stay here, there is no reason to go all inclusive. For those that choose NOT to go all inclusive: You can find incredible food all up and down fifth street (two minute walk from Gran Porto Real). There are small bars near the hotel such as blue parrot hotel that have swings (yes swings for adults) and you can have a beer for next to nothing. Plus cokes, water, alcohol beverages are very cheap at all the convenience stores (you can even buy snacks and breakfast foods if you want). The seafood restaurants are amazing on 5th street. Most of the restaurants have a menu outside so you can see what they serve and their prices. If you want familiar food there is a burger king and a Fridays. However, the local food is so amazing. The restaurants there can fit any ones budget. The best CHEAP fish tacos in town is near a hotel called Hotel La Torturga. It is on the other side next to the best CHEAP pizza slice place (real Italian pizza...the workers are local, but you know it is real Italian when you taste it). The fish taco place is an open bar/restaurant next to the pizza place. If you want to go all inclusive, check out Adventura Spa twenty minutes south of playa del carmen. I just don't see any point of going all inclusive at gran porto real. If you are going to be going on excursions, most feed you and give you free drinks. Save your money and have more variety with the local restaurants. If you want to go all inclusive: I recommend Adventura Spa (adults only) 20 minutes south. Awesome!! If you have children, I recommend XPU-Ha palace also like 20 minutes south of playa del carmen. There are some great photos of these two hotels on ------------------. Gran Porto Real does not have any photos on this website. Other hotel suggestions: El Faro (not all inclusive), pricey...but cute...... Hotel La Tortuga is not all inclusive and not on the beach. However, they have private Jacuzzi on the roofs. I think they are less than $100.00 a night. The normal size rooms are like $50.00 a night. Talk about saving money! Blue Parrot hotel (not all inclusive on the beach) is another good choice, it is a bit pricey, but also near it all (watch out for the noise level. Please note these hotels do have a high level of NOISE....(Blue Parrot has a \"happening bar\" and El Faro is right next to the night life (behind it). If you have kids and on a budget, hotel la tortuga is a better choice (that is if you don't want to stay at Gran Porto Real..which is kid friendly) Hotels not to stay at: Mosquito Blue....to loud!! There is a huge bar across the street from it, not children friendly. Adults can't even sleep at night with all the noise. Things to do: Hope this helps, I love Playa Del Carmen...If you want to do some fun fun things, try Xel Ha (great all day snorkeling, tubing, jumping of a cliff, eating, bike riding, cave exploring (in the water). If you have children, I recommend Xcaret. It is a water park/small zoo...the show at night is amazing...they have dancers from every state of Mexico (small children may get bored with the show, but older than 10, they will love it). We loved the show, we did the dinner & show combination at xcaret. You do not have to get the dinner, but is great idea for honeymooners....the dinner is somewhat romantic with the candles and the great view of the arena where all the dancing takes place (men like the show as well..trust me..it is not a girly type of show). Also, there is a fairy that goes from Playa Del Carmen to Cozumel. You might want to check the prices, it could be another fun trip to a different beach (just becareful about buying tickets on the street, if you do, make sure your hotel tells you exactly where to buy the tickets, there are some fairy ticket scams going on in playa del carmen). If you decide not to go all inclusive and want some extra tips, please feel free to email me at: Carries_addrs@yahoo.com p.s watch out for scams: don't fall for any timeshare scams at the cancun airport when you arrive, walk past the visitor center (all the people there will try to give you free tickets or cash to see a timeshare. You are in mexico, they will harrass you to NO end to buy timeshares. It is not worth the four hours to see the timeshares if you ask me, but that is up to you. At the airport, walk straight outside, there you will find your ride....Also, 90% of the travel agencies or rental car places also work for time shares!! If you give them cash to rent a car, they say for you to go see a timeshare, than they will give you the car. If you want to rent a car, do it off the web before you arrive. Have a great time, try to understand you are in a different country. If the locals yell at you to go into their shop, just know they have to feed their families as well.

The when I watched the construction was the only time I even noticed it. The food was ok once you figured out what you could eat I wouldn't call it great, there are three different places to eat at night one will work out for you. I made up for lack of eating with the drinks. They don't water down the drinks, if you want more liquor in your drink ask and you'll get it. The beach was beautiful, the boats are parked there just move down the beach to a spot that doesn't have rocks and boats. It's not hard to figure out how to fix that. The activities at the pool during the day are fun to participate or just watch. The upstairs pool bar is just as fun if your looking to hide from the down stairs pool activities.

There are 2 restraunts where you can make reservations for them and the Italian rest. was wonderful! We ate there 3 times in a week. The Mexican rest. was good as well.

We just found chairs on the beach, by the pool and walked back and forth. The drinks aren't super strong, but with having it all inclusive you are going to be drinking tons anyways, so you don't want to get drunk off your first drink, do you? If you want them stronger, you can ask or we found watching them actually make the drink makes them a bit stronger. I'm 24 and went with my mom and had a great time. It was also a great place for families as well as couples. I would reccommend this place to anyone. The location is great being just 2 blocks from 5th Ave, the place to be in Playa del Carmen.

However it seemed to me that this resort is a well oiled machine as they had documentation prepared for our arrival advising that they are sorry for the inconvience and would like to put us up at a sister resort at no additional cost (God Bless them, BAHHH!). Looking around at the lobby there must have been at least five other couples in the same situation. I have zero desire to stay with an entity that appears to have this poor of a track record for a prolonged period of time and is willing to out right LIE and deceive customers. We asked for our money back, the Resort complied despite several attempts to persuade us to stay at their sister resort. We simply grabbed our bags and found another respectable hotel without all the LAME Big Resort allure. With over 20 to 25 Mexico trips under my belt raging from the 5 Star Hotel to camping on the beach for a surf trip, I have found the Gran Port Real to be the most deceiving place I have ever attempted to stay at. I can\u2019t understand how a Mega resort can get booking\u2019s wrong when even the small Nicer Resorts in Playa Del Carmen can such as Mosquito Blue or Desso. My opinion is Gran Port Real are simply money Mongrels and book the highest paying customer booting the rest to a sister resort. \u201cNo Gusto Gran Port Real\u201d If you have an important trip planned such as a Honey Moon or simply care to relax AVOID THIS PLACE, if you want to gamble go to Vegas as the odds are more in your favor.

My wife and I, and our four daughters, ages 11 to 17, had a great March Break in Mexico. Before we arrived, we had planned to do at least one day trip excursion during out visit, but we were having such a good time at the Gran Porto that we chose to just stay at the resort for the whole week and continue to enjoy all it had to offer. We had booked our vacation in October, requesting adjoining Jr Suite Ocean Views. When we arrived, there were not two adjoining rooms available for us, which was disappointing, (in reality they were about 6 rooms apart .. not a big deal) but the Staff worked hard on this and by the next morning had made arrangements to provide two rooms beside each other. So that helped us settle in, based on their quick resolution of the issue. From there, we had a blast!! The Sports and Entertainment team are amazing. They are a high energy team that create a fun and enthusiastic environment for those of all ages. We have great memories of water aroebics (my arms still hurt), Mexican Bingo, Bocce ball, Braiding lessons, Beach Volleyball, Water Volleyball, a Bike Tour through town, snorkelling, boogie boarding, painting Mexican pottery, and on and on. The staff also put on entertainment each night, which was very entertaining and demonstrated the personal commitment that each of this team was making to ensure that we would have a good time. Shows ranged from a Mayan/Inca festival, to a Michel Jackson review, to a Comedy night. All were great! The Beachfront waiters and Bar staff were also very attentive, as their drinks were great, and the service was top-notch. We actually said \"no\" more times than \"yes\" to their offers to get us drinks, as they always seemed to be available to serve us. The swimming was quite good, as there was a nice sandy beach with just the right aount of wave action to make it fun. There were plenty of beach chairs, and the staff would bring extras if required. The food was very good, and the restaurant staff are very attentive and extremely professional. The Mexian Restaurant obviously prepares food differently than we may eat in Canada, but it was all very good, and our daughters ordered from the menu and were prepared to experiment. They have a menu that changes each day so check ahead. The Italian restaurant was first-class and had a great menu. We had so much fun at the evening dinners with great memories and great photo opportunities created. It was easy to book reservations, up to two nights ahead, and we had no problems getting times we wanted. After dinners we would often walk to Fifth Avenue, which was a great surprise that it was such a fun shopping area, plus so close to the resort. This is a big bonus of staying at the Gran Porto. Playa del Carman is a fishing village, so you see a lot of fishing boats moored in front of the resort. To us, this gave the place a lot of character, watching the fisherman coming and going each day, plus watching them return with their catch. We would have only one hesitiation about going back to the Gran Porto....... will it really be this great the second time!!!!!!", "Date": "March 23, 2004"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "5.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Kansas City, MO", "Title": "\u201cAwesome, quit compaining!\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR1736953", "Content": "This was the best place ever!!

You are in walking distance to the Avenue. No cab needed!!! As far as the boats on the beach, Hello!!! if you would read, you would find out that it used to be a fishing village, and people still fish there. I love the fact that I can still see the people who live there go fishing and bring their catch in every day. If you ask, they will take you with them!! We had a guy with us who all he did was fish with a local man on his boat all week!!! He thought he died and went to heaven. He is going back in October just to fish with the people who live there!! At Porto Real, I can eat when I want to eat, drink when I want to drink, and if I am hungry at 3:00 in the morning, I wander down to the all night cafe they have a grab a sandwich!!

They said that they would have to put us up in another hotel for one night and they would have a room for us the next day. We were taken to the Moon Palace Hotel, forty minutes away (almost back to the airport at Cancun). Admittedly, the Moon Palace was very nice although in a secluded location and not in town where we wanted to be. The next day (after several calls and an hour later than the time they had promised) we were picked up and taken back to the Porto Real where we got the ocean view, junior suite that we had been originally promised. The hotel had a mixture of guests, some on an all-inclusive plan and some like us on European plan. In return for our inconvenience the hotel agreed to give us free breakfast for the rest of our stay. While we were waiting for the room to be ready, I noticed that they had coffee and tea set up on a table in the lobby. There was no sign indicating that this setup was restricted in any way and no one seemed to be in charge of serving or anything, so I had a cup of tea. As we were leaving the area to go to our room, a hotel girl came up to me and said that there would be a $2.00 charge for the tea since we were only entitled to breakfast for free and this was around noon. When I objected to this and said there was no indication of the charge at the table, she said ?I am only doing my job.? However, when my husband complained about it afterward at the desk, the charge was removed from the bill. The hotel is very nice in a good location. Rooms are large with a large bathroom and shower. Our room was on the first floor and a great spot to watch the world go by, including two weddings at the hotel. Breakfast was good and service fine. People complain about the beach, which has fishing boats tied up and makes it difficult to walk. I didn?t find it a problem. They are constructing a new wing across the street, which will have a minimal ocean view. Would I return to this hotel, I think not.

So you can walk to the center and visit all the shops, restaurant, bars, ferry to Cozumel, etc. You don't need the all-inclusive concept here. Try all the restaurants for breakfest, lunch and dinner. It's cheaper and more fun to try the local food. The hotel itself is very clean, the staff very friendly, but at this time a construction site opposite to the hotel gives a lot of noise from 7 am to 7 pm for those with a room a the streetside (all accessible rooms). You can reach the swimmingpool without thresholds. The beach is not accessible from the swimmingpool, but it is from the streetside. The sand is very dense and the sea as bleu as in the pictures.These accessible rooms/ hotel are/is not as accessible as you want them/it to be. My husband depends on his powered wheelchair and cannot stand or walk at all. You can only enter the hotel by a very steap slope. Only a powered wheelchair can manage this, but you have to be carefull not to be thrown over backwards. The accessible rooms are all at the groundfloor at the streetside. The doorways are wide enough. The rooms have a step to overcome with a wooden slope not so steap. The bed is at seating height and is kingsize. The balcony is very small, you cannot turn around. The doorway to the balcony has a little threshold to overcome easily. The big problem was the bathroom. Allthough the rooms and the bathroom is beautiful furnished, the bathroom is inaccessible. The doorway is wide enough to enter the bathroom. There is enough space to turn around. There is a wheel-in-shower without grabbars or showerseat. It has a fixed showerhead and the controls are placed at 120 cm/4 feet. The washbasin is to high (1 meter, 3 feet), placed in a shelf and the controls are at the back. You have free space underneath the washbasin. The toilet is inaccessible. You cannot place your wheelchair next to it, it has no grabbars or other aids. So if you have to use it take a very strong friend, wife, husband or whoever with you to lift you.If you can overcome these shortcomings you will have a holiday of a lifetime. Friendly and helpful Mexican people, good food for low price (breakfest 35 pesos/hotel breakfest buffet 150 pesos, dinner 80 pesos), perfect beer, cocktails and smoothies (try), ideal weather, beautiful Mayasites (rented a Ford Econoline), amazing historical and folkes show in themepark Xcaret, a nice visit to Cozumel by boat, checking your email and a lot of shopping for souvenirs.Tip: Take ramps with you. Tie them to your wheelchair before checking in at the airport of departure. They can be helpful to enter the boat or the enter the car or any difference in height you want to overcome.Tip: Show yourself at all cashiers. You may get a discount to the admission charge.Tip: Bring some spare fuses for your wheelchair.Tip: Mexico has 110 Volt. Take a converter if your powered wheelchair charger depends on 220 Volts.And at last forget all the trouble that can occur maybe, discover the world and show everyone that wheelchair users can be as adventurous as anyone else.

The resort was beautiful, the staff was wonderful and always there to be helpful. Everything about our stay was great!! The breakfast buffet was our favorite meal. The italian place had very good steak and lobster. A lot of people complain about the drinks being watered down, all you have to do is ask for mucho alcohol and the bar tenders are more than happy ablige your request, in fact I think they enjoy it. If you go to Porto Real and you don't get good service it is probably because you don't tip. 5th ave. was probably our favorite place to spend time, outside of the resort, it was fun bargainig w/ the shop owners. Inside of the resort our favorite place was the swim-up-bar on the 3rd floor, it is a little difficult to find but, find it, it is the best place to hang out because most people don't know where it is so it is not crowded and you don't have to wait for drinks, the only down side is that it the bar closes at 5pm. We also went to cozumel on a snorkeling trip which was also very enjoyable. One problem that we had is that our alarm clock did not work right, but who cares, your on vacation you don't need an alarm. Also, the only other problem was making phone calls back to the US, but this is not the fault of Gran Porto Real. So all in all I must say we had the best time at Porto Real. It is close to everything and it is not in one of those \"fake hotel zone\" resorts where everything is \"too beautiful\" to be real. Vacation is what you make of it and if you have a bad vacation at Gran Porto Real then it is probably because you didn't want to have a good time in the first place.

Also, shame on you who put bad reviews on here and made me a nervous reck on the plane ride to Mexico because I was so worried that this was a bad resort.

The main positives are that the entire hotel staff is friendly and competent, the resort is clean and well maintained, and the food in the a la carte Italian restaraunt was excellent. The main negatives are that the bars all close at midnight, there are no a la carte choices for breakfeast or lunch, and the smelly erosion-formed lagoon that fronts the beach.

We could not get the proper lock for the safe. We were then transferred to another room on the side of the construction. The noise didn't really bother us and the room was much brighter. I don't think we would do another all-inclusive since we don't drink all that much and we were getting sick of eating at the same places day in and day out. The service was ok. The room and maid service was great but the dining service left a lot to be desired. We often had to get up to fetch our coffee or a bread plate from another table.

Paid extra for it. Had the room confirmed several times prior to arrival. Bam! Sorry Senor, there are no ocean view rooms avaible and there is nothing we can do. After about an hour of fighting and bribe offers of up to $200, the desk manager gave us a lovely construction view room complete with 7:00 AM auger drill wake up call, a bottle of champagne and a free massage. In talking with other guests down for the week, we were not alone. We were however succesful in a room change to our promised accomadation of an ocen view suite on day 2. Now I can hear folks saying, \"Yo dude, chill out, it's Mexico man.\" That is all true but when you combine the initial battle of room change with the price of accomadation, the boat taxi line up of about 20 boats in front of the hotel that one must navigate through to get to the water and the mid-shelf alcohol brands it takes all of one's zen skills to chill out. Those who think the place is great are liklely from very small cold towns in the midwest and have rationalized the excellence of their experience because to accept the truth that they were hosed on the one week escape from the cold vacation that they had been planning for six months might result in psychiatric hospitalization or incarceration. Did I have a good time? Yes. Why? Because Playa del Carmen is beautiful, the service staff are excellent, the people that I travelled with were very cool, I have a good sense of humor and to accept that it sucked would have resulted in my psychiatric hospitalization or incarceration. Go to Playa, be open to being hosed if you stay at the Gran Porto Real, walk north of there if you want to avoid the boats on the beach and don't miss a meal at the Yaxche Restaurant.

My boyfriend and I went to Grand Porto Real from Jan 30 - Feb 6. We had read all the reviews like everyone else, and admit, were a little reluctant. We booked thru a local travel agency (I would NEVER book a trip on the internet with seperate air and hotel reservations - that I think is what caused a lot of these booking problems). We knew the hotel was nice from the photos, and my brother and his wife had been there last year. So, OUR experiences: the hotel was very nice. Was it a super deluxe hotel? (remember..you want super deluxe, you pay a super deluxe price. I think this is a good middle of the road) No, but it was very clean, and they do have incredible staff. We paid extra to have a junior suite ocean view room. We would not go any other way at this hotel. People say you are never in your room, so who cares?..but even the time we ARE in the room is important. You can see all the complaints with the standard rooms along the street by the construction. We could not hear one bit of it from our balcony. Our room was incredible (room 354), the best I have ever had while traveling in Mexico. Like everyone says, HUGE showers! Our balcony was great and had a beautiful view. We did do the all inclusive package, and after our trip..decided we would not do it again. They have the two resturants (mexican and italian) which only serve dinner, and with a reservation ~ they were good, but have a very limited menu (especially the mexican, which was disappointing). The other dinning option is the buffet. It IS nice to have the flexibility to come and go as you please, but after 3 days of that food..it felt and tasted WAY too cafeteria-ish, even just doing lunch there. I know for the amount of people..they do their best. (breakfasts were great though) They have an outdoor palapa that serves food during the day (buffet style again) by the pool..but the exact same thing EVERY day to eat. Boring. We went out to eat the last two days, and were glad we did. We had the best shrimp dinners we ever had! They do have incredible resturants in Playa..it is worth it to take advantage of them. I guess the biggest reason to do all inclusive..if you planning to drink ~ a lot. If you add up the price of the food you may eat..you may come out ahead to NOT do all inclusive if you are not big drinkers. (and that means staying AT the hotel to drink) I am pregnant, so drinking was not an option for me.. my boyfriend had drinks, but nothing too much. The hotel has a 'sports bar', but honestly, it looked pretty boring. Never many people hanging out there. Most people ventured downtown I guess. At that point, you pay to drink. As far as the beach..it is true, the beach in front of the hotel stinks. BUT, walk to the left of the beach and they are incredible. We walked the beach every morning for a few miles..and it was amazing. There is very little on the beach to the left of the hotel (facing beach)..to the right, it is pretty packed with stuff. So, you are just a few steps to incredible beaches..but you lose the service of the hotel then. So, all in all..if you WANT to do all inclusive, this is a good hotel to pick. (great for families, although from watching, we were not too impressed with the 'Kids Club' they offer to help out with the kids and do different activities with them) Again, the staff were great. For us, we probably would stay elsewhere and go on our own, no all inclusive package. Because this hotel caters mostly to the all inclusive patrons, I would personally try another hotel that did not offer that option. Hope that helps some of you!

We spent a week two years ago at the Continental Plaza Playacar just down the beach and loved the hotel and area but wanted to try another hotel. Our travel agent said she had been to the Gran Porto and highly recommended it. Upon arriving on Friday were placed in a room (which we were told would be a partial oceanview) with no oceanview and total construction going on outside our room. No view and very noisy! We contacted the front desk and they told us they could upgrade to guarantee the oceanview for $255.00. We spoke to others that had upgraded and their rates were less. We upgraded the next morning to a beautiful oceanview. Then-our plug-in in our room did not work, they never fixed it, we were told that because we were not all-inclusive the ice was not included. Also we ordered room service and after 2 hours we cancelled the order and went out for breakfast. Also-no hot water every morning and other times during the day. Because we were not all-inclusive and wanted to try other restaurants we were treated badly.

First, here is an e-mail I sent \"Travel Oh City\" which ends in totally disgusted with Travel Oh City. To Whom It May Concern, We booked a hotel reservation through you for the Gran Porto Real Hotel in Playa del Cramen Mexico. After reading negative reviews on Trip Advisor about a \"Bait & Switch\" tactic, I faxed the Gran Porto Real to confirm that they had received our reservation from Travelocity for the specified dates for a front ocean view Jr. suite, all-inclusive. They sent me back a confirmation number with a person?s name. I also printed out your confirmation. Upon arrival, it was just as 35% of the numerous reviewers on Trip Advisor had experienced. Sorry sir, your reservation has been canceled. Canceled by whom I asked. Oh, by us. Why? Because for an oceanfront all-inclusive, you would have to pay $145.00 a night more. The manager tried to blame \"This Travel OH City\" said with a shrug of the shoulders as if he had never heard of you or pronounce your name correctly. \"We do have a garden view non all inclusive\" for $240.00 however, he stated. After debating with him what the word reservation means and talking the manager into an argument corner several times, with which he could just shrug and say sorry sir, there is nothing that can be done, he called \"This Travel OH City\" which somehow he conveniently had the phone number at his fingertips. After discussions with someone from your call center, we were offered a garden view room for $185.00 a night. I refused and had my wife wait with the luggage while I walked around Playa del Carmen for another hotel. In an hour or so, I found an acceptable hotel, booked it and stayed there. I know that Travelocity knows about this \"Bait & Switch\" that?s going on. As a matter of fact, most of it is through you. I have emailed several of the people from the review board on Trip Advisor to confirm this. I also know what?s going on. We booked a vacation package at the Gran Porto Real three years ago through Delta Airlines. After calculating the cheapest airfare, transfers, etc., the ocean front jr. suite all-inclusive room averaged around $350.00 a night. They are taking reservations on \"Travel Oh City\" far in advance to guarantee 100% occupancy, giving the ocean front jr. suites to the highest bidder, and switching who may agree to the other rooms. \"Travel Oh City\", being an agent for Gran Porto Real, is just as guilty as the hotel for this practice. Since this happens so often, I am sure some people have investigated legal avenues, as I will be doing Monday, I may have no recourse in that direction but I can tell you I will spend a great deal of time and effort via internet, disclosing \"Travel Oh Cities\" and the Gran Porto Reals deception. Also, Gran Porto will not appreciate the very unflattering pictures I plan to post on web sites and the Internet.Totally disgusted with \"Travel Oh City\",My wife and I did have a back up plan in case this happened. Even though we had no reservations I walked to El Faro, the hotel with the lighthouse that?s half way between the Porto Real and the ferry to Cozumel. Excellent place! Later that day, I walked down the beach to the Porto Real to check it out. Some one in an earlier review stated that they had built a children?s wading pool. Maybe that?s what the Porto Real calls it but in fact all they did was build a crescent shaped sand bar about 50' out from the shore to prevent any more erosion of the beach. This has created a stagnant pool between the hotel and the ocean full of floating algae. The beach between the hotel and the pool is about 4' wide and drops off a good 3'. If you would like pictures of this area, just email me. On the north side of the hotel is the still uncompleted pier and across the street is the new hotel being built. There are cranes all over the place. Also, the last time we were there, they did have music playing at the pool, but it is a lot louder now. They are probably trying to drown out the construction noise. That along with the volleyball ref. blowing a whistle between every serve, the terrible condition of the beach, and all the construction they really did us a favor. I am sure the service you get at the Porto Real is excellent. That?s the only reason I think people give it a good review.

We stayed in Playa del Carmen at the Gran Porto Real which was totally awesome. Location, Location, Location is the most important aspect of this resort. It has all the amenities so you do not actually have to worry about that. The only cause for my reservations are this and listen carefully: Always drink bottled water, stay away from their fresh milk and cheese, bring on your trip power bars (especially if you want to do day trips to places (off the resort) where there is no guarentee that the food is washed in agua purificada, bring bran bars to help you digest your food and move food in your bowels if you do indeed get sick, bring gravel, Tums and other gastro-medicines just in case, sunscreen a total necissity, American one dollar bills for tipping (you will need many of these so bring a lot of them..you will be surprised at the doors that are open to you when you tip, do not go on the tours arranged by your resort (one's in town are a lot cheaper by almsot 50 percent in some cases. They have plenty of ATMS so don't worry about getting extra cash. When buying goods don't feel sorry for them and haggle the prices. These people are trained salespeople and can quickly point our weaknesses in your bargaining skills- they are professionals they do it for a living- bring a spanish book so you can learn common used phrases i.e. Kwanto es, Kwanto Costara etc etc. If you are avid snorkerlers bring your own snorkelling equipment so you don't have to pay to use for rental (we brought out own and it saved money) Bring napsacks for your back. Apart from those tips you will find other things on the way to help you out. Our resort Porto Real is situated at the beginning of Playa del Carmen and a 30 second walk to 5 avenue which is full of shops, coffee places, bistros and speciality stores are everywhere. Wonderful! 5th avenue has a European flair with a Mexican facade. Porto Real, is located right next to the Cozumel ferry which is a 5 minute walk either through the beach or 5th avenue. The ferry rates are $7.50 US to get across. If you decide to go on the ferry and have reservations about sea sickness go on the top of the ferry on the outside where your eyes can adjust to the sudden movements of the boat and view the horizon for stability. During our stay we went to Cozumel twice and checked out Chankaanab (must see A+ AWESOME snorkelling-literally a rainbow of fishes good for kids and adults), San Miguel (the main city A- (lots of shops), we rented a TJ jeep and circumnavigated the island and checked out all the beaches, checked out Punta Sur (South most part of th isalnd) has a lighthouse you can climb with some history beautiful spot for pictures, crocodiles, deer and beautiful and natural snorkelling..saw lots of star fish, parrot fishes, barracudas (etc), went to Puerto Morena for some wave surfing and checked out a restaurant overlooking cliffs called Bongos which was cool (ask to see their family albums) ha ha.In Playa, we shopped a lot and visited some restaurants, go to Java Joes for cheap coffee and read the Cancun Times and watch some hockey games on tv in Mexico quite cool. We went to Chichen Itza which the tour cost us 35 bucks each. It was a MUST SEE. (A++++++) It is something our of tomb raider AWESOME! Its worth the day trip..if your going to do a day trip go there expiecally if you appreciate history/anthropology/architecture. On the same tour we also went to a CENOTE which is an underground cavern of water with stalgammittes they are all over Mexico (are snorkelling equipment came in handy here. We also went to the city of Vallenoid which had a beautiful Catholic church and plenty of shops. (all of the above was one tour). Bought a pack of smokes for a buck here.We also went to Tulum which is an A, skipped the tour guide and went on the beach instead at Tulum which is beautiful. Beautiful places for pictures. We also went to Xel Ha which is an eco park I give it B- as i was not really impressed by it since Cozumel has similar eco parks for cheaper and there were kids everywhere not good for honeymooners. It still nice though so if you have the money and time then who cares right?Our resort had 4 restaurants we went to the Italian one 3 times. our favorite one. The main restaurant called the albatross..they do try to change up the menu and there is an attempt but still it is very easy to get sick of the food...try to diversify your eating as much as possible and take the time to make reservations for dinner instead of jsut eating there. The staff was curteous (Talk to Carlos at front desk he is good) and Benito (server) is awesome. No complaints at all.. The resort has a shop, 4 restaurants, two pools, a hot tub, spa, weight room, etc etc. It a 5 star to me.During the end of our trip we decided to got to Cancun since Porto Real is owned by Royal Holiday which has chains of its hotel all over Mexico- we could transfer)Went to Cancun for the remaining of our honeymoon at the Gran Caribe and again it was awesome, however I would say this place is a4 star not 5. Rooms are OK not bad but not great either. Pool was big which was cool and the atmosphere was not as laid back as Playa which was not better but different as there were more pools games and interactive activities with the employees. Service was not as good in Cancuun we found though but it was still good. During our stay we went to COCO BONGOS ( A+) One of the best clubs I've ever been to. You would have to go to know. Also took a Catamarin tour of ISLA MUJHERES (A_) which is right across the ocean which was fun....laid back isalnd we rented a golf cart and checked the island out and went to the turtle conservation area and had a great time on this tour. Apart from that we checked out all the malls in Cancum the La Isle Mall, Carousel and the Negro Market. Not too impressed though the Isle Mall had 'up\" class clothes but none of the clothes were cutting edge or new nothing you couldn't find in a new city but the mall was beautiful, Carosel mall not that good and the market were OK. I found Cancuun a bit more aggressive and not as friendly as Playa but its to be expected in a more Americanized town.Our experience with Royal Holiday- Gran Porto in Playa and Gran Caribe in Cancuun was awesome. Our honeymoon was awesome never a dull moment and we learned a lot about Mexican culture and we had a lot of fun travelling throughout the Yucatan Penninsula. My highlights were Chichen Itza, 5th Avenue, Cozumel and Cancuun....literally Playa del Carmen is the perfect place to stay if you wish to see a lot of stuff in a limited time. Also have the Sopa del Lima soup a Yucatan must dish.

But, at least we were up early and out enjoying the beach and warmth. The food was good, though by the sixth day anywhere, it would get repetitive. The drinks plentiful and topped off with more liquor on request. The bar staff know what they are doing when it comes to serving 'light' drinks, otherwise they would have a lot more alcohol-related troubles. The location makes this resort worth the trip. Two minute walk from room to beach. Five minute walk to 5th Ave. Minutes from other beach areas. Great beach waiter service. Great, friendly, efficient service from all the staff we dealt with.

It was quite overwhelming as they some of them were dressed formally and they looked like customs people we found our way out of the airport and found our ride.Once at the Gran Porto Real we made it to the front desk and this was where I was anxious to find our JR. Suite awaiting us sure enough our room was waiting and the bellman was waiting to take our luggage to our rooms. Once in the room we noticed two double beds rather than one king and the bellman explained that these rooms were away from the construction noise so it was better and we agreed.

Our tour company gave us an apology note and a fruit basket for the flight mix up which was good.The hotel room was spacious and very nice.

We had absolutely no problems. Some meals weren t my favourite but hey, you get what you ask for! The service in the Italian and Mexican restaurants was second to none!The beach is a bit eroded and the boats are a bit of a pain, but they are also interesting to watch and the pelicans are also interesting to watch as they perch on the boats! The beaches to the north and south of our location were great and the scenery was great!The shopping and restaurants and bars on 5th Ave were good, I did hear one husband say that he didn t see the need to go any further down the street as he felt that all of the shops looked the same I m sure his wife disagreed. The Blue Parrot was a good nightspot to go to and the hotel had a night trip to Senor Frogs another good nightspot for the young and the restless.Overall, this trip was a 10/10 with no complaints I would say it s all about attitude.

Just make sure you buy a package trip through a respected travel agent and you will not have any problems. The people who were having problems went through Expedia and stuff, never a good idea. And don't worry about the food it was great everywhere, even at Pac-Chen the Mayan village. People who complain about the food are probably picky eaters and have forgotten the fact that they are in a FOREIGN country. Come on people, this isn't America give it a rest. Enjoy your stay and appreciate how hard these people work to make you feel at home while away. The beach was fine just go to the north end of the beach or stay at the pool. If you want comfy chairs the blue ones are better than the whites but go down EARLY to reserve your spots. By 7 a.m. they were getting filled up. Overall I would say this is a 4 star hotel, sufficient for most tastes and adequate for all. Just relax, order dos Dos Equis and chill........

The person at the front desk was very considerate concerning the construction noise going on and asked if we would prefer a junior suite w/ a king size bed across the street from the noise or a quieter room on the other side w/ 2 full size beds. We opted for the quieter room of course! We bought the all inclusive plan and ate at all the restaurants--they all served very good food with great variety. The staff was very friendly and helpful. The jucuzzi on the roof is wonderful and so's the view. The bartender was great and continually brought us drinks when we wanted them. The beach is somewhat eroded, but they have made an excellent contained shallow pool for kids to play in. Even if you don't save lounge chairs early, there are plenty of chairs by the hotel and the staff are very willing to bring them where ever you want. The location is perfect, minutes from 5th Ave. The only setback is the phones, if you buy prepaid phone cards from home, you will not be able to use them. You can't call home from your room, unless you call collect or have a regular calling card. If you buy a prepaid card from the gift shop, there are 4 phones located in the lobby and sports bar where you can call home.

It did not bother us because we did not want to sleep the day away. We wanted to get up and start another fun filled day in the tropical sunshine. We all went on the all-inclusinve plan and we all are in agreement that it is the only way to go. The food is very good at all of the restaurants. We all LOVED the Italian restaurant. The food by the poolside is also very good, and the drinks are simply delicious. We were in a standard room and when we go back we would like to upgrade to the Jr. Suite. The view from the Jr. Suites is magnificient !! If you like to shop you will love the fact that you can walk to 5th avenue from the hotel and will not have to spend money on a taxi.

BOTTOM SHELF liquor is abundant. ask for something better and they will probably come up with it. if not, plan on having a killer headache. 4. there are people in the lobby that will harrass you about buying daytrips and timeshares. seriously, IGNORE THEM COMPLETELY and don't make eye contact. i saw some very uncomfortable situations where guests got the hard-sell and gave in to things they clearly didn't want to do. DON'T WORRY ABOUT BEING RUDE TO THEM. They are there to take your money. 5. also, the floors are soooo slippery. girls, leave your stilettoes at home. trust me on this.having said that, we thoroughly loved the beautiful grounds, fabulous room (ocean front jr. ste), and wonderfully attentive and gracious staff. we tipped them every day as they survive on tips. the hotel only pays them a disgraceful $3-4/day. please be generous. we gave $3/day to housekeeping and a dollar or 2 at breakfast/lunch and $4-5 at dinner. the location can't be beat as you are only about a block from the enchanting town of playa. we will definitely go back.", "Date": "January 21, 2004"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "4.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Minnesota", "Title": "\u201cGreat Service, Great Location but N-O-I-S-Y!!\u201d", "Author": "PK6", "ReviewID": "UR1557818", "Content": "This will be a great hotel when the construction is completed.

Not at all opposed to cutting loose (we sure did) but no one wants to hear you mouthing off about how drunk you're going to get. I would avoid Playa during spring break. Food was overall good. Service attentive and very polite without fawning. Activities you book at the hotel (e.g. scuba) are overpriced -- you can do much better on your own in town. Cocktails good and strong, stronger than most in town. Housekeeping very prompt. Room decor nice. Spa services fine, competent. Workout gym pretty small and if you're not all inclusive, it costs you $8 per day (we skipped). Security is good, visible and active (keep your bracelet with you).

I definetly recommend using a top notch travel agent and booking through a reputable company. We booked Jr. Suites ocean view but our papers didn't say ocean view so they didn't provide us with ocean view rooms until our travel agent had America West fax them the correct information and still one hour before check out the front desk manager, Nicholas, was trying to charge us $40 a day for each room. It finally got resolved through our travel agent. Overall I would go back again but just making sure my papers indicated the correct room category/rate. We went with three generations and everyone loved it. It is small enough for the older people to get around easy yet there are enough activities to keep the teenagers happy. We loved the breakfasts and lunches but the buffets at night got a little old. It's nice because you don't have to get dressed up at all. Shorts and t-shirts are fine. We ate at Il Pescadore (Italian) two nights and enjoyed that but we dressed up the first night becasue of the dress code but there were people in shorts and t-shirts. Maria Margarita's was good but we hit it on an off night. These are defintely places to go. The people down there work hard to keep the place up - the beaches (small) are great although if you want prime seats you have to reserve your chairs early. There is construction next door too. We talked to some Canadians who spent a week at Principe Bahia Tulum which 3 of 4 people liked Porto Real better - food was a bit better, proximity to the beach was huge, ocean views from the rooms were much better, close proximity to town was huge too. Overall we had a fabulous trip - just beware dealing with the front desk and getting what you paid for.

My youngest was actually sobbing when she had to get on the bus to go to the airport. I have to admit, I got a bit misty myself! We have made so many new friends from guests to staff. The activities crew(especially Alexis, Alejandro & Baloo) treated my girls like they were princesses & by the end of the 3rd day knew them by name & they were made to feel like they were part of the crew becuz they participated in every activity, and there were lots!! Water volleyball twice a day,beach volleyball,water polo, horseshoes, bocci ball, bike tours, Mexican Bingo, the list goes on & on! Needless to say, we were never bored.The beach is beautiful, and the only time we saw seeweed was when the wave action was quite heavy which didn't happen until our 2nd to last day there. The rocks are there, but the water is clear unless there's heavy wave action, so you can steer clear of the rocks quite easily.The food was excellent in all the restaurants, but our favourite was Il Pescatore, and the service there was great as well. Jose & Pasquale were excellent waiters. The buffet was great for breakfast & dinner, & we usually ordered from the lunch menu @ the pool bar or ordered from the grill chef.There's also the VIP Lounge which not many AI people knew about just past the lobby. It was self serve, and they had chicken wings, cold meats & cheeses, nachos & desserts. They also had juices, pop, coffee & bottles of different types of alchohol if you wanted to zip up your drinks a little. It also had a pool table & air hockey game, as well as a T.V. if you wanted to catch a movie. Our girls used that quite a few times for lunch or to hang out in the evening with friends they had made at the pool. It's definitley worth checking out!The barmaids & men around the pool were there all the time getting drinks constantly for you. These people work their butts off for about $42 a day, so I had no problem tipping them once a day!!! They also had a portable bar set up on the beach so you didn't have to go to the pool for a drink if you didn't want to wait for a waiter to come to you.The swim-up bar was at the 3rd floor pool, but we never bothered going up there becuz it was way too much fun @ the main pool, and didn't want to miss anything!There is not one single thing I can say bad about this resort. It exceeded my expectations beyond anything I could have dreamed.I would highly recommend this place to all of my family & friends, and definitely plan to return there next year!!The one thing I can complain about are how some guests treat the staff.

The hotel overbooked half of our party (10 people) and made absolutley no apology whatsoever. No one cared. When we asked to speak with someone of authority, I learned my next lesson: Mexican hotel managers are named \"Tim\" and only work from 9-9:30 pm on weeknights. It was like dropping the soap in a prison shower: once you're there, there's not a lot you can do to change what is going to happen. It just seemed like the Mexicans had a different word for everything, including hospitality. For the price, aggravation, and metaphorical prison rape my friends and I suffered while at the Gran Porto, I would strongly recommend staying elsewhere. Playa is wonderful, but not when you get cheated before you even arrive. I will say that the highlight of our trip was when we walked down the beach and saw none other than Lorenzo Lamas from \"Renegade\" fame. We bought him several beers as he recounted story after story about action scenes from the set of \"Renegade\". He even talked trash about Chuck Norris!

My wife and I went to the Gran Porto Real for our honeymoon from May 5th to May 14th, 2003. Our time at the resort was great. I don't need to go on and on about our trip, but I have a few comments. First, the beach. I had read some reviews about it being small and full of seaweed. The size of the beach was fine, there was plenty of room for everyone and there was some seaweed on days when it was windy. It was never a problem though and it didn't keep us from enjoying the beach and the water. We spent most of our time at the resort in the chairs under the palapas on the beach with the sun and some drinks. That was the good life. Second, the food. The food is good, although in our 9 days there it did seem a bit repetitive. The Italian restaurant was easily the best place to eat, we had dinner there 5 out of 9 nights. Overall, the place is excellent, 3 months later we can't stop talking about our trip and are looking at our pictures all the time.

We had a great time in Playa Del Carmen and for the most part, everything was a blast. I read tons of reviews before making my decision and didn't really know what to think. Some people said it was great, then the next said it was horrible. For anyone reading these reviews, hears what you do. Take every message and combine them and you actually get the truth. Most people complaining on here are most likely the same ones complainaing about everything life has to offer and should get over it. The hotel is astonishing, especially if your used to the Holiday Inn HA HA. The floors, walls, and ceilings are all designed and decorated nicely and the rooms are awesome and exactly like the pics, as far as the Junior Suites like we stayed in. The food was absolutly great except for a couple of items and the same could happen anywhere. Food I didnt like my wife did, so its just a matter of choice and taste. The people are more freindly than those you meet at most places, yes largely because they want a tip. Heres a tip, don't always tip because then they expect it. We rationed the tips out, but splurged a little on the first day to ensure good service. The drinks are awesome and had more alcohol in them than other places ive stayed. The pool is nice and lots of chairs. You might have to wait a little while for someone to leave but we didnt and it was a full house. If you are one of these people that I read about who are going to get up early in the morning to save a chair....get a life people, you should be ashamed of yourself. Now its time for me to complain. I am a beach and ocean person. If you are as well then this might not be the best place for you. Start of with the seaweed problem. The hotle cant stop nor be blamed for Mother Nature spotting this location as the seaweed dump site of the Carribean. The hotel does its best by having people out there all day long removing it. They even have a front end loader scraping it up. There is a new pier being built right beside the hotel and is not very pretty but will be done soon I guess and no longer a prob. The beaches are all public so no fault to the hotel, but there are all these little fishing boats tied up along the shore. You can snorkel right in front of the hotel but watch out for these things. They are supposed to drive slow but yeah right. If you are a rookie snorkeler it would be neat. If you are a pro than dont waste your energy, nothing really to see except the bottom. If you are a diver, they have a dive center/shop in the resort, but make sure to do the wall dive in Cozumel. Even though we went all inclusive we still went to town and ate twice. Be carefull were you eat but do it atleast once. No higher price than a trip to Applebees, but a neat experience. Beware that what looks like mozzerella cheese may in fact be goat cheese so asking may be in order, if not what a surprise you will get. While in town, make sure to walk down to the very end of, I think 5th Avenue, and watch the guys spray painting pictures. We bought two and they are awesome.

The pool scene is great (especially the cool little pool on the 3rd floor); the restaurants are fun and convenient with very adequate food; I had a particularly great meal at the Italian restaurant. We loved the size of Gran Porto; if we forgot something when we went to the pool, we could be at our room and back in 2 or 3 minutes. I would only do it all-inclusive because it just makes life so simple and the service is excellent. We became great friends with a couple of the waiters in the Albatros (the main restaurant) as well as buddies with a couple of the staff out at the pool. They are really nice folks. Despite the All-Inclusiveness, we still got out in town a good bit and took time to do Tulum, Xel-ha and a snorkeling trip over in Cozumel. . . . all of which were a lot of fun.

If you dont like what is on the buffet then just tell them what you want. My wife didnt see anything she wanted so she got a steak at 2 in the afternoon. As far as the beach. Boats and seaweed are a problem. This is something that the hotel cannot help. There are at least three guys always picking up seaweed. Remember that all beaches in Mexico are federal owned. So the hotel cannot tell someone where to park their boat. Location of the hotel is the best. Shows were great and I recomend that you try eating at a place downtown at least once (Sur, great steaks). 5th street really gets going once the sun goes down. Shops stay open until 1100pm and there is plenty of night life. I will defintly go back in a heartbeat. 5 days was great and now I want more.

Since May I have read all the reviews that have been posted regarding this resort and at one point, I was concerned. But in speaking with our travel agent about 4 weeks ago, she assured me that none of her bookings have ever complained about the Grand Porto Real. Our agent recommended this resort, not only because of past success but also because as a family of four, we were not looking for a wild, busy, overly crowded resort. And the Grand Porto Real met all those expectations. Upon checking in before 12 noon, standard rooms were available but our original reservations for 2 Jr Suites were not available the first night; however our new rooms were ready the next morning by 12 noon (the front desk even offered to move us, if we would just pack everything up) and we took advantage of the complimentary massage that was offered to us for the inconvenience; which was great as well. Our daughter's boyfriend traveled with us as well but because he booked his reservations much later than ours, he was not able to get the All Inclusive package. In our attempt to try and keep all 3 rooms close together, the front desk offered him the All Inclusive plan free for the entire week if he would not change rooms when we did the next day; needless to say, the boyfriend was smart enough to see a great deal and stayed in the same room the whole week which ended up only being just at the other end of the hallway from us. One reviewer some time ago wrote that a smile and a kind word goes along way . . . and that is most certainly true. Even though our original reservations were not met the first night, the front desk was very accommodating for us and I firmly believe alot of that is contributed to our attitude at check in; we knew that there was a 99.9% chance that our 2 Jr Suites would not be ready the first night, but we kept a calm, positive attitude and in the end everything worked out well. Everyone at the Grand Porto Real was extremely nice; their knowledge of English varies with housekeeping really not knowing any English, to the restaurant. bell boys, and front desk understanding considerably more. The food at the buffet and at both restaurants was wonderful too. Keep in mind, you are in a foreign country so many of the meats and vegetables are prepared differently than in the states, but there was always various meats, fish, vegetables and fresh fruits ,salads to chose from; and the choices do change daily; and yes they will cook something special if there is anything in particular you want. Did not try the Mayan coffee, but the show that the waiters put on during the preparation of such is truly a sight! Mixed drinks are alittle weak, but my husband & I would just ask for shot of whatever the liquor was in a separate glass and add it to our drink. All in all our vacation was great and I would recommend the Grand Porto Real. Just keep in mind about the over booking and remember smiles and kind words go a long, long way.

Out of all the hotels we have stayed at in Cancun, Cozumel and Playa, Gran Porto Real's architecture and colonial decor really made a difference.Now, UNLESS YOU ARE NOT A BEACH PERSON, I would suggest staying at Gran Porto Real because the beach was very disappointing. I am a very \"go-with the flow\" type of person who has certain levels of expectations and will try to see the best out of every negative situation. Well, I also happen to LOVE THE BEACH which is why I only got in the water at Gran Porto Real one day....out of the 8 days we were there. The boats docked on shore really emit a strong \"fishy\" smell which you get used to after being out there for a bit. But the seaweed is all over the place along the shoreline...so you have to get through it to go any further into the water. The rocks are pretty rough too. My husband gashed his foot walking back into the beach, my brothers-in-law (3 of them) cut the bottoms of their feet and so did my sister. I didn't get any cuts but I am pretty cautious about feeling where my foot is about to step next. Once you get past the rocks ( I suggest dropping down onto your tummy and swimming out using only your arms) the water becomes clear, sandy bottomed and really nice. You can go pretty far and stand up (I'm only 5'4\" and I could stand without going under for about 10-15 yards from the buoy). So, the remainder of our stay was spent visiting Cozumel, Cancun and the other side of the ferry in Playa in order to swim in some really wonderful beaches.The pool was nice and on our days where we weren't doing an ecotour or deep sea fishing. We were at the pool playing water volleyball and relaxing. So, that's why I would warn any beach lovers to rethink staying at this hotel...unless you can be happy hanging out at the pool. The buffet food was mediocre at best. Although breakfast was always wonderful. The Chilaquiles, beans, omelette station, waffles and fruit rocked! The Pool side Grill served wonderful cheeseburgers, Pizza, ceviche and club sandwiches. So check out the buffet first and if you don't like it you can still order from the grill with the buffet waiter. Also, you can order from the grill whether you are at poolside or on the beach - that was great!Dinner at Il Pescatore was wonderful!!!! When you make your reservation (with the concierge) let her know you'd like to be seated in Jose's section. That guy is the ultimate in providing impeccable service during a dinning experience. The Lobster is pretty darn good too. The second time we ate there, we were seated in another guys section who was the antithesis of Jose. This waiter (can't remember his name) was put off when our table didn't want to order the same thing all around!!! I placed my order first and he tried talking my sister into having what I was having, then her husband and finally my husband. Anyhow, he was so busy kissing *** at a table of 8 that he totally ignored the four of us and finally came over and said, \"chocolate cake, cheesecake and ice cream. What do you want\". So, I tried to work with him thinking his english was limited and said I wanted Ice Cream. My sister said chocolate cake to which he responded angrily, \"you don't want ice cream?\". Then my brother-in-law was about to tell him what he wanted when this waiter simply walked away from him and ran over the table of 8 who were leaving in order to see if they left him a tip!!!!I told my husband that this was the last straw and we all agreed he was totally offensive to us the entire dining experience. So we got up and left.Funny thing was that the table of 8 didn't tip him and this guy could've gotten a good tip from us 4 if he hadn't treated us as second rate....because we were hispanic. I know this sounds crazy but on a few instances we noticed that the bartender at the swimming pool on the 3rd floor was rude and irritated we even were at his bar when instead he was doing anything and everything possible to accommodate a group of 3 non-hispanic guys and 2 non-hispanic women who were being loud, had just met and were soon being entertained with one of the very hefty women dancing on the bar which caused her sanitary napkin to slip out from under her boy short style bottoms!!! I AM TOTALLY NOT MAKING THIS UP! One of the guys merely tucked it back into her shorts - AAAAGGGGHHH! So anyway, prior to all that happening, I had asked the bartender if he could turn on some music to which he replied, \"It's broken\". But when Big, Foul, Redneck woman wanted to show off her \"sexy\" moves to another woman's husband (who was all over her - even when his wife stopped by the pool to tell him she loved him) the bartender cranked the tunes. My husband went and ordered 3 margaritas and the guy never acknowledged him, but he made the drinks and put them at the opposite side of the bar for us to get.Now, don't take any of us wrong because we totally don't like it when people pull in the \"race\" talk but these two instances were so offensive to us that we felt it important enough to share. Everyone likes to get good service or at least be made to feel like you paid someone to treat you well while you're on vacation...but these two guys thought we were some poor hispanics who he was sure didn't have any money to tip as opposed to the other groups of loud, lewd, vulgar groups of non-hispanics - who didn't tip them at all. Unless a dirty dance with sanitary napkins falling out of your swimsuit is \"hot\" or considered a good tip.My husband is a physician, my brother-in-law a nurse practitioner, my sister in criminal law and myself an in-training interior designer. We love paying tips well to people who work hard at making your vacation, dining experience, or whatever the case may be a truly enjoyable one. These were the only instances where we felt like regretting we had manners, were polite, considerate of others around us and respectable guests. So keep ask for Jose's section at Il Pescatore and watch the guy at the pool bar on the third floor in the event some unsavory behavior is brewing because he'll forget you even exist.Other than that, the front desk, bell boys, housekeepers and staff were wonderful. The hotel is not noisy...if you need total silence to sleep I suggest not staying at a resort where everyone is here to have some fun, stay up a little late and dance around. Besides, everything gets quiet around 11pm at the hotel. If you're there on a Friday night, walk down the beach towards the ferry pier and you'll run into a cool beach bar called the Blue Parrot. The music is fun, ambience cool, and the party gets started around midnight.Oh, and the massage at the hotel spa is great. Josefa was my massage therapist for 50 minutes and I was put in a wonderful state of relaxation. If anyone has any other questions for us regarding our stay at Gran Porto Real we would love to help. We can safely say that we will not return there on our next trip to Playa. The beaches on the other side of the ferry pier are indescribable. If you like parasailing go to Senor Frogs and a gentleman waits there to recruit new parasailers. They'll take you out on the gorgeous beach by jetski to a boat and you'll parasail over some of the most breathtaking waters you can find. That's why we will definitely pay more to stay on that side. PLEASE take some time to comb that side of the beach...", "Date": "June 23, 2003"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "1.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Pasadena, CA", "Title": "\u201cExtremely disappointed\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR1090811", "Content": "First, the hotel did not want to give us what we paid for -- ocean-front view junior suites.

We arrived at the hotel around 11:00 in the morning and our room was not ready. Our travel agent told us this before we left so this was not a surprise. We were in the AI plan and the front desk gave us our arm bands and had someone take our luggage and we went and had a few cocktails and had lunch. By the time we were done eating our room was ready. We had reserved an Ocean Front Jr. Suite through our travel agent and this is exaclty what we received. Our room was about 5 steps from the beach and was very clean and beautiful. We were a little hesitant about the hotel from reading some of the reviews, but we certainly were happy with what we had and soon forgot all about the negative reviews. My advice about the room is to use the safe that is provided to you free of charge. My husband and I never felt unsafe the entire time we were there we had gone to the beach at night and sat in the beach chairs and never did anyone ever bother us. But I had read previous reviews about money being stolen from a room, and just wondered why you would be in a foreign country and leave your wallet or cash sitting out in view of others. The safe is there for a reason. It is not the hotel saying it is an unsafe place, but you are not in the US and they are looking out for your best interest.Even in the US money can disapear so again my advise use it, it is free and you won't have to keep track of your valuables if they are locked up. About the beach, the first day we were there, there was a lot of seaweed, but the hotel staff spent the entire day cleaning and cleaning until it was gone. The rest of the trip the water was very calm and there was not a problem with the seaweed the rest of the week. There are not rocks on the beach itself, but there are a few in the water. The water was very calm and clear when we were there so we could see the rocks and go around them. There was a lot of area that was sand that you could sit anotten our towels early and reserved a couple of chairs and never had any problems finding a place to sit by the beach or by the pool. The food was pretty good. The buffet was not that great, but the other restarants that you could order off the menu were very good. Just a tip, if you don't see something on the menu that you want just ask and if they have it they will get it for you. My husband and I took this tip from another traveler and received shrimp cocktail and other items by just asking. Try a Mayan Coffee at Maria Margarita it is a neat show and a very good drink. We took a couple of trips one to Tulum and XelHa and it was great. We would highly recommend this trip. We also went snorkeling at Paradise Reef and had a great time. The hotel staff were always pleasant and I felt that they wanted us to have a great time, the hotel itself was always very clean and beautiful. We went in a Funjet package and I would highly recommend this. The FunJet people that were at the hotel were there every day and if you had any issues they were there to help you. We have stayed at Sandals Resorts and I would say that besides the variety of the restaurants and some water activities it was pretty comparable. I think a positive attitude makes a big difference and a vacation is what you make of it.

I was very leary after reading all the reviews about not getting the room you wanted, and was ready to fight for what we paid for. I had even requested the North side of the 3rd floor. We traveled with another couple. We arrived around 12:30 pm and our room was still occupied by Corona, who was making a commercial, but were given the option to move to the 2nd floor away from our companions. We opted to wait, and changed to bathing suits in the other couple's room. At 5:00 pm, my husband had to threaten management that his evil wife would come back down, as we were instructed to check back every 1/2 hour, which we did. Other than that, the place was terrific, and everything positve you have read was true. We did not like the all inclusive arm bands. Other resorts did not have these. Beware of the Mexican reservation only restaruant, it was not what we expected and saw little Mexican items (if any) on the menu. The Italian restaurant was fabulous and we ate there multiple times. The barbeque buffet night was mediocore, but all other nights were very good. The beach was not very walkable due to the magnitude of boats roped up to shore. We learned from others who had visited before that the Iebustaur(spelling) and another big resort that I can't remember the name of had better walking beaches, but these resorts are a good 1-2 mile walk from 5th avenue (shopping district). One resort we visited for a snorkeling trip had a very good snorkeling reef right in front of it, but this resort is up in the 'resort mecca'. The shop owners are pushy, but not hardly as bad as Cancun's open market or on Cozumel. We all felt 'safe' in Playa Del Carmen; I didn't feel I had to clutch my purse to me at all times in a death grip. Xcaret is worth going to - although MANY of the park's features were under construction - for $71.0 a person, I'd ask in advance what's closed off if you go. The night show there is better than a lot of Broadway series shows I've seen though, es more than Cozumel or Cancun, which seem to have transformed into little Americas.

Our travel agent assured us the Gran Porto Real would be the best honeymoon spot for us. We arrived at the hotel at 1:30pm and were told our room would not be ready until 3:00pm. We had lunch at the buffet, food was ok, then went back to the desk at 2:50 and asked if we could be shown to our room. They again said our room would be ready at 3:00. We were finally allowed to enter our room at 3:10. We had no oceanview, instead, we had a view of the street with a storage shed on the other side. Our travel agent had assured us that she had requested an upgrade to an oceanview when we upgraded to a junior suite, and would make sure they knew we were a honeymoon couple. We apparently got a junior suite, but it was very small. Our mini-bar was not equipped and there was no chapaigne or any sign that anyone knew or cared that we were a honeymoon couple. We then decided to go for a swim in the ocean. The ocean was beautiful, but the beach was very seaweedy and rocks are extremely hard too avoid and sharp. It was impossible to swim there. We then went back to our room only to find that not only was the view awful but we were situated almost directly over a karaoke bar with very loud shouting and music, which went on until after 11:00. We had only had five hours of sleep the night before. I went to the front desk to complain about the noise and requested a different room. They said the could downgrade us to a standard room or opt to take their promotional deal to stay at each of their sister hotels in Cancun, but they had no other Jr. suites to move us to. Don't believe the internet pictures or anything about upgrades. It simply is not true. They are apparently always overbooked, even in the off season. However, we did not flash money in their faces, that may work. We ended up moving to the Gran Caribe Real in Cancun. It was a beautiful hotel on the gulf side of the hotel zone. We also asked that we be allowed to stay there for the entire weeitely would not return to the Gran Porto. Again, were told our room would be available at 3:00pm, even though the deskman at the Gran Porto assured us they had a room awaiting us. We ended up enjoying the Gran Caribe. The beach was gorgeous, no rocks, always chairs available, super clean, no seaweed. The pool was also very beautiful, and the food was better. The rooms were beautiful as well, and very spacious with a view of the ocean in all but a few. We did get a partial oceanview at this hotel. We did take a tour to Tulum/Xelha, which was absolutely beautiful and well worth the money. Snorkeling for the first time at Xelha is an experience I will never forget. We did have to travel farther to see Tulum and take a ferry to Cozumel but the difference in the hotels made up for the travel time. Playa Del Carmen is a quaint and beautiful town, just like they say, and a great place to spend some time, but the Gran Porto Real is quite a gamble, just like all the reviews suggest. This hotel is rated a 5-star, and if you are lucky enough to be in one of the few oceanview front rooms you may agree, because the hotel and pool is beautiful, but if you are put in one of the rooms on the street side this hotel takes a quick dive to a 3-star. If you want to swim in the ocean, you do not want to stay here. Too much of a gamble for the money in my book. We would definitely return to the Gran Caribe Real but would take an afternoon flight instead so we would make it there after the rock solid check-in time of 3:00pm. Oh, and when they jokingly refer to the mexican minute, they are covering themselves, the mexican minute does not pertain to tourists, we are shuffled around at top speed only to wait the mexican minute to begin another shuffle.

We were also happy with the location, the shopping district was about a block away, an easy stroll and the beach was right out front. I would advise anyone wanting to stay at this beautiful resort that when making reservations make it clear that you want an ocean view room otherwise you could be stuck with a room facing the alley of the back of the hotel. It is worth it to pay a little more to be facing the ocean. We discovered Maria Margarita's the second day, it was amazing and it is all covered under the all inculsive plan. The food and service again was great! I can not wait to go back with my family next year. If you don't like crowds than May is a perfect month to visit Mexico, it is pretty much the only down season they have. Although it was really hot and humid, I am sure there summer is worse. If it is your first time traveling to Mexico I would recommend a book from the Lonely Planet travel series called Yucatan. It helped us find the best deals for day trips around the area and when to go with a tour group and when to go out on our own.

We had read some of the negative comments and were somewhat apprehensive but quickly found out that everything we hoped for was what we got. We have travelled for over 30 years and this hotel and the town is about as good as it gets. The hotel is georgous and everytime we walked to our enormous room on the 3rd floor, we marvelled at it's beauty. We had 2 queen beds, a brightly colored decor and a wonderful balcony which had a partial view of the ocean and street. The bath was hugh. The hotel provides bath robes if you ask for them, which we did, and after our shower, they were wonderful to dry off in and sit for a rest on the deck with a drink after a full day at the beach. We had the AI with room service once a day. We felt the food here was above average compared to other resorts we have stayed at. The Italian Restaurant was our favourite. Pascal was wonderful and our service was tops. We found the staff amazing and accomodating and once they got to know you, they never forget your name and your favourite drink. The hotel is always booked and it is difficult to get chairs but this is not unusual in smaller resorts. We have found this elsewhere. Also there is seaweed on the beach but this is not the hotels fault. Nature does what it does and the staff works tirelessly to keep it cleaned up. There are 2 great beaches within 2-3 minutes walk on either side of the boats and a walk is needed after eating so much. Fifth Avenue is wonderful and must be experienced. For all ages and one would never be bored. Anyone finding fault with this area has to be looking for negatives. This is not a perfect world and neither is this resort but it is a wonderful place to spend a vacation and we would recommend it to anyone. We met people from many countries and we all shared the same opinion. The Time Share Sharks are there and you just say, No, and move on. I do feel they should not be placed at the elevator to dance, you have to go outside the resort. Down the beach or street, you will find about whatever you want. Not everyone has the same experience and I feel badly for those who do have a poor room and get poor service but we are seasoned travellers and have found that a smile and trying to speak the language and enjoy the culture pays big dividends.

Very special place--the Best hotel I have ever stayed at--anywhere in the world. Would go back in a heartbeat. This gorgeous place puts you right in the middle of authentic Mexico, yet surrounds you with world-class service and amenities. Gran Porto Real is two blocks from the very quaint cobblestoned shopping district of the port town of Playa del Carmen. Several blocks full of local treasures, authentic restaurants, strolling musicians, locals selling their handmade wares. This authenicity is in stark contrast to other all-inclusive hotels, who have built small replicas of Mexican villages--but it's all contrived. Gran Porto Real offers access to the real Mexico. Also close to wonderful day trip destinations: 20 min. to Akumal (try the snorkeling at Yal Ku lagoon!), 40 min. to the ruins of Tuluum (bring your suit and take advantage of a beautiful, small beach there), 15 min. to themepark Xcaret, 35 min. to eco-park Xel Ha, 35 min. to the airport in Cancun, 30 min. ferry ride to Cozumel.... Rent a car for a couple of the days and explore!Hotel itself is very beautiful. Rooms, balconies, hallways, courtyards, restaurants, pools, beach--everywhere you look is gorgeous. No trouble getting the oceanview jr. suite we booked. LOVELY and immaculate! We used the hammock on the balcony every day! And yes, scout out the small secret pool with swim-up bar and whirlpool on the 3rd floor!Restaurants were wonderful--esp. Pescatore, the Italian restaurant. No trouble getting reservations. Buffet was great--loaded with fresh fruits, vegetables and a comfortable combo of local cuisine and more American fare. Even our very finicky 7 year old son found an abundance of satisfying choices every day.Yes, stay away from the hard-sales pitches going on in the lobby.

This is our second time we've stayed there (first time 3 years ago) and this time we took our 2 children (ages 6 and 7). As a recent review states, there is a bit of truth in each of the reviews on this site of this hotel. We had a fabulous time and would go back in a second. The kids did not want to leave. There were a wide variety of vacationers there - singles, couples, young & old, families, and very internationally diverse. The kids enjoyed exploring the hotel - finding the rooftop jacuzzi was a big hit. There are hammocks up there, and a great view of the ocean and town. There is a kid's club - the employees in charge are very kind, lots of fun, and good with the kids. Our kids weren't at the kids club much, but had a blast with crafts and sports when they were. The cleanliness and location of the hotel are excellent. The staff is its best feature. They couldn't be more customer oriented, all of them. In the restaurants, they will go out of their way to make sure you are happy. For example, one night we stood indecisively between the Albatros (buffet again!) and the Maria Margarita restaurant (menu) with our kids wanting to have buffet again and my husband and I wishfully eyeing the other menu. They sat us down in the buffet side, but served us (the adults) 2 excellent suggestions from the other restaurant. The Italian restaurant on the other side of the building is excellent. Yes, they have lost a lot of beach to storms (compared to the beach there 3 years ago, it is quite narrow), but we did not notice more seaweed there than anywhere else. There is still enough beach for plenty of loungers in front of the hotel, a volleyball net, and a walk alongside. Lots of people were swimming. (Our kids spent more time in the pool.) We found the local fishing boats tied up there to be an interesting view, not an annoyance as others have written. Playa was originally a fishing village before becoming a hot tourist destination, and we were glad to sly, you see the fishermen biking to the shore with their equipment. We had a standard room (in the annexed section) this time which I was worried about after reading some of the previous postings. We stayed oceanfront last time so had something to compare it too. We loved the Standard. The construction previously mentioned is completed. Everything clean and in working condition. The only small negative is the rooms are smaller than the oceanfront suite, but with kids this time, it did not matter. We weren't in the room for long period of time anyway. It was a great location at the resort. (We were in Room 424) The \"private\" pool on the with a bartender just a few steps in front of our room was wonderful. The jacuzzi and rooftop view was just upstairs from us, and the spa, salon, italian restaurant, sports bar and workout facility just downstairs. There was also an ocean view from the patio outside our room. The worst thing about the resort is the timeshare and \"membership\" salesmen off the lobby entrance. Just say no thank you to everything and go have a good time. Remember when you are approached that nothing is free, you will have to put in at least an hour listening to some sort of presentation for that free rental car, blanket, etc. We went to Xel-Ha (rented our own car and spent the day). The large tours do spend too much time driving around picking up people at other hotels. If you're up for something different, I highly recommend Alltournative Tours. We went to Pac-Chen and Coba with them this time. Small groups, very informative guides (ours was especially great with the 2 kids).

I would recommend the all-inclusive...if you drink and plan on staying at the hotel most of the time. This was the first time that my fiance and I actually spent all of our time at the resort. Usually, we go and do many different things while on vacation. We just layed on the beach drinking our Pina Coladas and beer. Everyone was very nice for the most part and the rooms were very nice. There is some problems at night with people talking in the hallways (which are all marble) and causing an echo. In other reviews we read that people had problems with the pushiness of time share people, that was not a problem with us. All in all this was a wonderful trip at a great location. It is all by it self which is nice if you want to just relax. If you are looking for something more then you might want to look at Playacar. I would definitly recommend this hotel and will probably return in the future.", "Date": "March 5, 2003"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "5.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Calgary, Alberta", "Title": "\u201cBeautiful Resort - Totally worth it!\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR860976", "Content": "It was totally worth the change!

The beach is not nice, rocky, lots of sea weed washing ashore and lots of garbage washing up also, there was garbage washing up on the beach to the north also,the beach to the north is very nice for swimming, no rocks, but it sucks to have to walk there everytime you want to take a swim to cool off and once the pier is completed this will become much more of a problem. The food, ok, not great but very much inline with other AI places i have stayed in the area, Maria Mariritas was good, more upscale type meals and you can order most anything you want even if its not on the menu. The rooms on the street side near the sidewalk bar are very noisy until midnight when the band quits, the only way to escape this is to get an ocean side room, also you can hear everything in the room next to you so if your next to loud all nighters be prepared. The service, great service pretty much everywhere, a little slow for food at the outdoor poolside but not really bad and several days they grilled at the beach so if you wanted something quick this was nice.Overall a nice place, would we stay there again, I'm not quite sure we would, possibly but the only reason we wouldnt is the beach, we are beach people and I think once the pier is completed it will it will limit your options and unless they do something to improve the beach in front of the hotel it will only get worse.

The first 2 nights we were in a room over the garbage pickup and kitchen alley and the noise woke us up about every 2 hours. After the first 2 nights and much complaining we were moved into a great room with an ocean view. We had 12 people in 4 rooms. My mom had to be moved to a handicapped room - they ignored everything we asked for in a letter we had written in Spanish and faxed the week before and put us in rooms all over the hotel, but we did not run into the overbooking problem. They are in the process of building a ferry dock right next to the hotel. Once that is built this hotel is going to be very noisy. I would strongly recommend that no-one go to this hotel on the European plan. We were treated like 4th class citizens. Whenever we wanted something we had to practically tackle a person to wait on us. They had to go through the hassle of having us sign for everything so I understand it was a pain for them, but we really had to fight to get service (kept the cost down). Speaking of the cost, everything at the hotel was outrageously expensive if you are on the European plan. $12 US for the breakfast buffet (we found breakfast for $3 US 2 blocks away), $6 US for a can of Tecate from the room fridge, $3 US for a Coke, $17 US for the lunch buffet and we didn't even price the dinner. They tried to overcharge us for coffee on multiple occasions, the women by the coffee in the buffet is a bulldog and wants to charge for each pack of sugar. It was ridiculous and they really should provide free coffee (or at least free refills). The upside was that we found many reasonably priced places in town and tried out some pretty good food elsewhere. Email if you want some suggestions. The maids were great, we had flowers and our towels shaped like a heart for Valentines. Overall an OK experience. We did not run into problems with the timeshare people, they do wear hotel shirts and act like they are part of the hotel (some VIP thing). We just said we were not interested and they left us alone. We had a big problem with AquaWorld tours that is in the hotel - We booked 9 people for snorkeling and diving in Cozumel. They said we were going to Chakanaab (sp?) and then took us out by the big cruise ships in Cozumel to snorkel over sand. Then the divers got back and did not have time to eat, they ended up eating in Cozumel and spending a fortune. We complained to the tour company they said tough. Almost $900 US and we were totally ripped off. Other people recommended Scuba Playa who are downtown. They (AquaWorld) have a booth in almost every hotel in Playa de Carmen. I strongly suggest that other tourists avoid this company, they were awful and then very rude after they ripped us off.

Definitely request something on the third floor, as the other floors would have an obstruction of the view with the palm trees etc. The Hotel: I have never seen a hotel property kept so clean! I think they must have more staff then people staying at the hotel. The hotel is constantly being cleaned. My boyfriend was sure to take care of our housekeeper, and we have fresh flowers throughout our room during our entire stay.

One Note: We went with the all-inclusive plan, but still tipped at meals and with beach service, but we noticed most people did not. This is such a shame, because the staff's pay is sure to be minimal and they really work hard to please you. Tips are NOT expected, but definitely appreciated. Location: Perfect location. With the exception of the rocks in the water directly in front of the hotel. But just a few short steps, to the left or to the right you will be sure to find a great spot. Be sure to try the snorkeling, check out the fish along the jetty that is to the left side of the hotel. You will find some attempts to control beach erosion (some sand bags etc.) but this is all done to protect the beach.

We found many of the Europeans(espescially Germans) to be on the rude side,and very negative about americans. we found this espescially offensive as this was just a few months after 9/11. however we met some very nice people from Amsterdam with whom we became friends and spent quite a lot of time with during our stay. The staff was generally quite nice, a little tip here and there and they became even nicer. The waiters always had a cold beer ready right as the last beer got warm. The food was good at first but got boring as the week wore on. Although it's hard to complain about steak and eggs and chile quile's for breakfast. Asked for some hot sauce and was given Tobasco, I found this interesting as so many good hot sauces are made in Mexico, why are they importing theirs from Louisiana? Some of the highlights of the stay included, fishing with some locals on one of their colorfull boats, and snorkelling in Cozumel. Now for the big negative! when you awaken on your first morning, a card is left under your door inviting you to come to the lobby to recieve your free blanket and bottle of tequila. We took our card down and it turned out that to get your freebies you had to sit through a hard sell shpeel trying to get you to buy timeshares in the company (apparently this is really big in the area). we opted to forgoe the gifts and not attend the sales pitch. This really pissed us off, we came down to have fun and relax not get hit up to buy timeshares. With all the telemarketing and spam we deal with at home, one shouldn't have to deal with it on vacation! It wouldn't have been such a big deal if you weren't slammed with this as soon as you get off the plane. Right after you get through customs you have to walk through a gauntlet of high pressure sales people trying to get you to spend a day at their resort. Then on the streets of Playa, you get more of the same. We went to Jamaica the year before and had no such problems, everyone was into you having a good time and noone tried to sell you anything, except in the tourist trap shopping centers. That being said, we would still go back but we now know to ignore the vacation pedlers. A blanket and a bottle of rotgut are not worth valuable beach time.

This is a regular practice at the Porto Real and it has happened to other guests we have sent to the Hotel. The Gran Caribe is home base to the companies VIP Time share program. They have double billed my credit card. Failed to fulfill several of their written committments and are generally a fraud. Management has refused to address my complaints about the VIP club.

We didn't have any problem getting our room. It is probably because Sept and Oct is the hurrican season of the year and therefore it is slow. The hotel at that time was only about 60% occupancy. The hotel is beautiful. Staffs are extremely friendly. The buffet food is ok but Maria Margaritta resturant has the best food. The drinks are not water down, excellent quality. The suite we booked is a no-ocean view and yet we can actually see a bit of the ocean from our balcony. Our suite was good; clean and quiet.. They bring drinks and food right to you on the beach. That is the service I want for my vacation! It is right in the town of Playa Dell Carmen. So it is very convenient to do shopping or if you are not on all-inclusive, there are also a lot of resturants along the main street. Walking distance to bus station and ferry pier to Cozumel. If you are invited to tour around the hotel and learn more about their membership club, don't go if u are really into joining. It will be a waste of your sun & beach hours (at least 2 hours) although they say it will only take 45 mins. They have very good sales person who won't let you go easily without signing the membership contract. The only thing we don't like about the hotel is that the beach is really small and it is parked with a few speed boats which makes the beach even smaller. Not enough shade on the beach. The pool is rather small.

We, like most other travelers, were concerned about the overbooking problem. We had a spanish speaking friend call and confirm our reservations 2 days prior and our travel agent faxed our confirmed reservation to the hotel. We were the first stop on the shuttle bus from the airport to the hotel. It was a half hour ride with no problems. We got our ocean view junior suite with a few palm trees blocking our perfect view but really no big deal. We did request a 3rd floor room but they were not able to accomodate us until the next day. Once you unpack, who wants to move rooms. The room is beautiful and large. It did need a little repair here and there in the bathroom but who cares, you're in paridise. The housekeeper made these great swans scuptures out of bath towels and sprinked them with rose petals. Very nice touch. We had NO problems with the food. We ate buffet for breakfast, poolside for lunch and Il Pescadore for dinner once and the rest at Maria Margarita's which was our favorite. Ask for the table outside, it's quiet and romantic. There was a keyboard player there who is excellent and he played our wedding song and we danced. It was very special. The gift shop is very resonable and has some things you won't find on 5th Avenue. We took out a pedal boat and rode bikes through 5th avenue. There bikes are kind of old, but it was fun to explore 5th avenue by bike instead of walking. We went on \"The Fury\", a catamaran which sails from Cozumel to several reefs around the island then it stops on the beach for lunch and sunbathing. Don't forget to take dramamine if you get sea sick. The ferry and catamaran can be a little rough. Very nice trip for $58.00 per person. We booked it through our tour representative (Olympus) in the lobby. There aren't many complaints about our trip. Just a few...The lighting in the bathroom isn't great to put on your makeup. Bring a travel lighted mirror if you have one. The drinks seems watered-down. And the coronas at the poolside bar were not as icy cold as I would have liked. I think that 1/3 of the bottle of rum they use for strawberry danquiri's is water! Just ask for them to top off the drink with alcohol. They didn't seem to mind. Bring some smaller bills to cash into pesoes so you don't have to exchange them back into dollars when you leave Mexico. They said you don't get back the same amount that you bought. We did find out that the front desk will cash a hundred dollar bill into 20's. And the most important thing I learned...You CANNOT use an american phone card in Mexico. You have to buy a latadel phone card to use on the latadel phones surrounding the hotel. They have a metal chip on the card that slides into the phone. We bought one in the pharmacy on 5th avenue. It was $1,000 pesoes ($10.00) for approximately 20 minutes. I wish I had known this before I spent $50.00 on phone cards in New York!! We had to leave earlier then necessary to go back to the airport on the shuttle bus with Olympus Tours. We left the hotel at 11 am to get a 2:30 flight. We were annonyed because we could have spent another hour on the beach instead of in an airport. we were checked in and went through security by 12:30. We had 2 hours to wait. Let the tour company know that you do not want to leave earlier than you have to. There is not much to do at night time unless you like to bar hop. And for those traveling with children be cautious of the topless sunbathers on the beach. They were at our hotel as well as surrounding beaches. And the only other complaint is that is wasn't long enough. We wish we could have stayed longer. They offered guest to go to there other resort in Cancun. Those that were staying for a week or longer were dividing there trip and getting to enjoy two areas of Mexico for the price of one.

I just got back today, I was there from october 13-17. I was nevous about the overbooking and was prepaired to put up a fight if they did not accomadate me. I got there and check in was good it took about 2 min. and I got what I asked for. The jr. sute rooms are great. The shower is huge and the whole room is big. The service is great they do a awsome job of getting you your drinks while your at the beach and the service inside the resturants is fabulous. You must have reservations or you will not be able to eat there due to the limited space for seating. I had the lobster and paid the extra $14 and it was not worth it. the lobster was real tough and had no flavor I think it was over cooked. The room service was ok one night we had to call and check on it. It took around and hour to recieve it. But the staff is great make sure you tip them just if it's a dollar or two they really appricate it and they will do anything to make you happy. If you go up stairs to the third floor go all the way down the hall you the right and you find a pool that has a swim up bar and is never crowded. I would say that is great place to hang out. Thats where me and my girlfriend spent alot of time. I don't have any major complaints but there are a few little things such as: the beach being full all the time, the beer selection was very limited (basically they had corona and corona the main bar had 3 kinds but not the selection you would think from a five star hotel.) and the if you wanted to eat at the resturants you needed about 2 hours or so it took a while no matter what time you went. But all in all I would go back in a second the hotel was VERY clean and the service was great. I you have any questions e-mail me at LowerJms@aol.com.

Flew out of Atlanta, and the trip only took us about 2.5 hours. Arrived in Cancun at about 11:30 a.m. their time. We got through customs fairly easy, and were immediately shown to our shuttle van. Ride to Playa was nice and uneventful, and when we arrived at the Gran Porto, it took our breath away! Resort is beautiful, and the lobby is gorgeous, all decked out in marble with stained glass chandeliers. Check-in was a breeze, and we decided to stay with our standard room accommodations. I'm glad we did, because our room was just steps away from the pool and swim-up bar on the fourth floor. We also had a great view of the ocean from the terrace/walkway. The room was very nice and clean, and were really higher-end than I expected because of all the complaints I'd read on other boards. The beds were roomy, almost as big as a double, and the room was really cute. Maid service was good, and we even got some swan towel sculptures! Minibar was always stocked well every morning with sodas, beer and water. All-in-all, standard rooms are great - especially if travelling on a budget. Service is impeccable everywhere you go, so please tip! Folks really go the extra mile to make you feel at home at the resort, and I even had a couple waiters whip out a lighter for my cigarette! Please make sure you tip, especially if you get good service - which you will! My husband and I were on the AI plan, and we felt we got a really good value for the money. We ate at every restaurant there, and liked the Italian the best. Maria Margarita was just so-so. This time of year, the reservations process was more relaxed, and I made arrangements for dinner as late as 2 p.m. one day. If you want to treat yourself, pay the extra $14 for filet mignon and lobster one night - you won't be disappointed. As this was a relaxation vacation, we didn't do any tours, but we did rent a scooter and a jeep for a few days and zipped around town. We talked with a lot of the local folks (thanks to my broken spanish) and ventured into the \"real\" neighborhood one evening just to check it out. Everyone was very friendly and we never felt unsafe. We went to Cozumel one afternoon, and if you are even mildly sensitive to motion sickness, I'd recommend you get some sort of medicine. I didn't, and I suffered on the ride over. The ride back was okay, though. In a nutshell - had a wonderful time, will definitely go back to the Porto Real, and will probably go again this time of year. Weather was great (we were lucky), and prices are blessedly cheap. Complaints: Very few. Just relt really bad for the shopowners. They were really desperate, I know, but they got kinda bothersome sometimes. Flight seats were a little cramped, but besides that, the flight and service equalled all the domestic routes I've flown. MAIN COMPLAINT - Other vacationers stared a lot at my husband and I, to the point of us being uncomfortable, I figure because there weren't many black couples or people of different ethnicity. Other diners would stare during meals, when we walked together or talked to one another, just everywhere. I even had one older (white) gentleman smile and say he thought I was bringing him his food as I came back from the buffet. So please, be kind and courteous to EVERYONE while on vacation.

When my boyfriend and I first walked in, we were awed by the beautiful, open architecture. It seemed majestic with a Mayan touch. Getting the room you want seems to almost always be a problem, from what I've read. I thought our room was going to be big, with a large bathroom, because that's what the hotel's website insisted. But instead we got a small, cramped room at the end of the hotel (probably in the part that was cannibalized). However, it was satisfactory, except for the fact that we got two beds instead of one. The next day we moved into a room downstairs with a king size bed. It was annoying having to wait a day to unpack and settle in. Other than that, the beach was AMAZING. The water was calm. And blue. And clear. (Try snorkeling there, the aquatic life is subtle but definitely there). There were hammocks and kayaks and beach chairs. The pool was beautiful and comfortably warm. The hamburgers and hot dogs were delicious, not to mention the wonderful french fries. The staff walks around asking you if you want anything...they were especially nice. The food was OK. The buffet was so-so. I didn't eat at the Maria Margarita, but we did try the Pescatore. Everything there was well-done, except that the food was somewhat lacking in flavor, but that's relative, I guess. The wait staff in the Albatros buffet was helpful and pleasant. The service in general was awesome, except maybe for the front desk. Nearby is the quaint town. I absolutely loved it...except for the shop workers who harass you to buy something. A lot of the stuff was too expensive!!! But it's a nice walk. Not too noisy and crowded, you know? The first two or three days were spent frolicking on the beach and at the pool. I have to say that the resort seems to attract mostly couples. I suppose it's because of the romantic location, away from the hustle and bustle of the city in Cancun, but not in the middle of nowhere. The remainder of the vacation was spent indoors, as hurricane Isidore made its was across the Yucatan peninsula. It got a little crowded in the lobby as it got too windy and cloudy to spend time outside (the hotel was fully booked). There were a few momentary blackouts. Just one of them lasted for a few hours, but the staff went around and gave everyone candles, which I thought was very considerate. I'm glad that it was a nice resort, though, because it would've been hell to be trapped by a hurricane in anything else. I'd recommend to you this: Get an all-inclusive package. Try to get a room # below, say, 315. Tip only the cleaning people, as I've heard they're the ones who need it most (and they're total sweethearts). Wear water shoes at the beach. Go with a significant other. And pray that you don't meet a hurricane down there, but take solace in the fact that even if you do, you'll probably have a nice time.

Now let me clairfy our travel experiences... we're Americans, however, unlike most we've been to 67 countries, all seven continents, and I've lived in Australia, Belize, England and Ireland. We've stayed in the best of hotels, castles and resorts, and of course, the not so great ones too, and based on those qualifications I would rate this hotel a 10 on a 1 to 10 scale. We had NO PROBLEMS with check in or them honoring our jr. suite. In fact we had a bottle of chilled champagne waiting for us in our room complete with snacks and finger foods when we arrived. The service was amazing... the food was great. We stopped ordering from the menu and just gave our requests to the waiters at the restaurants... we were never denied nor charged extra... from prime rib, filet mignon, to crabcakes. We were spoiled rotten by the staff who remembered us by name and everything was done with abundance and great attention to detail. A couple of suggestions... if you book this resort through a wholesaler such as American Airlines, MLT, Suntrips, etc. ask about their room allotment policy. Contrary to popular the result of overbooking is the wholesaler's fault NOT the resort, as the wholesaler operates like an airline. AA, MLT and the like typically overbook more rooms then their allotment as to have an overlap, only have final confirmation of numbers when deposits come in from passengers. Reconfirm with your wholesaler NOT the resort prior to departure and have them reconfirm with the resort. If you do book through a wholesaler, ask for their local representative's phone number. If you do have a problem while standing in the lobby these people will be the best facilitator. Also, American Airlines will accept collect calls but you cannot dial a 800 number from Mexico so you'll need to get their number with an area code. Pay the extra money and upgrade to a jr suite or oceanfront jr suite. These rooms are ONLY located in the Gran Puerto Real side, not the hotel that had been annexed. There is a little travel agency located right around the corner from the Italian restuarant... they not only post the weather for the week outside on a sign, but they are about 50% cheaper for local tours and car rentals. And if I were you, I would recommend renting a car rather than doing a group tour to do any of the ruins or cenotes... all is sign posted well and east to navigate. This is a wonderful resort and fabulious staff... you just have to take the USUAL precautions and be smart about how you book. If you have any questions at all, please feel free to email me!

When we got to the room we found we were on the second floor right over the pool and to get a view of the ocean you had to bend over and turn sideways because of the palm trees.
