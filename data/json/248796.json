The journey on the 'toy' train - the LDR - turned out OK [no more than that!], but the hotel was a great disappointment. Reception in and out was good - quick and friendly. The room and ensuite were both very cramped though clean. You certainly couldnt swing a cat! The bed wasnt particularly comfortable and i was cold. There were no extra blankets and the heating did not work - they had obviously switched it off. I was very annoyed to discover there was no Free WiFi unless you went downstairs and perched uncomfortably in the foyer. a password was needed but not offered - and they appeared rather reluctant to provide it. You could of course pay for landline access in your room. I was most annoyed though to find the only food was either Chinese or their so called pub, both of which looked pretty grisly. None of their restaurants were open! Amazing. Luckily i found a pub beside the Excel building were i had an adequate meal.

This, unfortunately, was about the only positive thing that could be said about our entire stay there. When we first arrived at reception, we had to pay a \u00a350 maintenance fee, refundable on check out. Any hotel that insults its guests by charging this amount for such poor facilities is an immediate bad move. Walking through the corridors to our room, which was in the middle of nowhere, surrounded by rooms with no door numbers and cleaning cupboards, it seemed we had walked into the 1970s with the bright turquoise and fuchsia peeling walls and dirty carpet. We couldn't even find our room, surrounded by all these nameless doors, and when we eventually found it, it was a twin room instead of a double! So off back down to reception we went, and the receptionist was very rude and unsympathetic about the mix-up. When we eventually arrived in our tiny room, with an overnight ferry-style shower/toilet combo, and a sink in the corner of the room, we were less than impressed. There was a door in the wall that would lead through to the room next-door- UNLOCKED- which caused problems later in the evening, as the guests in that room were being shamelessly noisy and the thin walls and door let all of this noise through. It took 2 complaints to reception before someone came up to tell them to be quiet, although I have to say they fell dead silent after this! Our experience in the hotel's pub restaurant was less than satisfactory. It's 'award-winning' facilities, as it turned out, had won an award for hygiene .......... 4 stars?! (a basic standard you would expect in any restaurant!), not food or hospitality! We could see into the kitchen, and whilst we waited quite a while for our food, they were stood around chatting! The fish and chips were very greasy and served with tartare sauce in plastic pots- classy! The mattress in the bed was creaky and uncomfortable and the noise coming from outside the shut window was as if it were wide open! The shutters-down shops and building site across the road provided a not-exactly-scenic view. Then there was the continental breakfast! The worst we've ever had. The orange and apple juices tasted revolting, and I should've known that helping myself to a bowl of lumpy, congealed-looking yogurt was a bad idea- it tasted as if it had been kept out since the previous morning and I couldn't manage even half a spoon! As the only satisfactory option in the bare, dirty restaurant were croissants, and I can't eat pastry, we travelled into central London starving, and had the sense to buy our own breakfast for the next morning! Overall, a terrible experience- do not waste your money (even if it's only \u00a350 a night!!) on this shambles of an excuse for a hotel.", "Date": "March 11, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Lincoln, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cVery handy\u201d", "Author": "Kelly S", "ReviewID": "UR125719015", "Content": "I stayed here on a recent trip to London.

Very small room for 2 persons. The mattresses were the worst i ever slept on ( suggestion to owner: Go the Ikea , buy the cheapest mattress, cannot be worse than yours ) . Noise of a generator and a loud singing Indian woman kept us awake. At 01.30 hrs we went downstairs and asked for a proper room. We got a 'superior' room at no extra charge . The mattress was somewhat better and we managed to move around in this room. The website suggests an en-suite bathroom but it appeared to be a small shower cabin, comparable with those used in a Motorhome which do not fit people with a B.M.I. higher than 25. Don't drop your soap because you can't bend over to pick it up unless you open the rolling screen. This room does not deserve the qualification \"superior\" . Television in the 'sub-standard' room did not work properly,but in the \"standard\" room it did.

Instead they use a small electrical heating device which you can switch on if so desired.The food in the Cafe was okay as was the service. The Chinees Restaurant was closed during all 4 days of our stay.During this stay, no drinks/snacks available after 22.00 hrs. Although we were assured by the staff that the pub would be open till 23.00 hrs during christmas/boxing day, it was closed. Staff was friendly but the info they gave was not always reliable. They advised us to use a taxi as buses were not running . When we asked what that red double-decker was that was just passing the hotel, they looked very amazed. London Transport workers seem to use the Chistmas days to go on strike . We chose the Custom House hotel because of the nearby DLR-station.

Our room was cleaned and towels changed daily. Sheets were changed once during our 6 night stay. The room was average size with a tiny WC & shower room. The bed was comfy and big. I have no complaints about the room except that the shower was powerless, it took ages to get your hair washed. Also, the walls were quite thin and you could hear everything from the corridors and loud voices from other rooms. There was not that much people on our floor though and we got a good night's sleep every night. The continental breakfast was better than I expected. It contained apples, croissants, rolls, bread, yoghourt, cereales, coffee/tea/juice/water etc. The breakfast was served in a nice \"restaurant\" with big windows. The only thing that bothered us was that the staff was a bit too eager to clean the tables and barely waited for people to finish. For example, one morning I was eating my cereales and held the cup in my hand. The waiter came and asked \"Finish?\" and took my plate away though it still had a bit food on it. It might be a cultural thing though and we got a good laugh from it. Overall the hotel was clean. There were some stains in the corridor carpets but they still didn't look dirty. The pub and cafe downstairs were nice. The staff was averagely friendly, not too enthusiastic but not rude. The access to central london was good as the excel station and bus stop were just across the road. However, the journey takes for about 45 minutes as you have to change the line so many times so we didn't bother travelling to the hotel many times a day. The 12-14 hour days in the centre were quite long and our feet were killing us in the end of the week.

So, I would say the location is fine, especially with a decent price through one of the major websites. The hotel itself is clean and the room was fine, albeit cramped. Small rooms are fine for us but this one, i'd have to say is fairly poorly designed. Stay in a B and B Hotel or Premiere Classe Hotel in France and you'll find an all in one bathroom/pod which means extra room within the actual hotel room. This hotel on the other hand had a separate shower, separate toilet and a wash basin in the room corner. It still works but just takes up more room than is needed in my opinion...but then others may like this separate style....all comes down to personal preference. Free baggage storage was also good and there is a pub attached to the hotel, and a chinese restaurant and a cafe. We ate at the pub and it's standard English mainstream pub food...absolutely fine but not exclusive food. Internet was extra cash. No idea of connection as we just went to EAT in town and used the free wifi there. Anyway, as mentioned, the hotel was clean, easy to find, easy to get around and good value for an expensive city like London. It was a tiny bit noisy with 'seemingly' doors closing from somewhere but in all honesty, it was not too bad, all things considered and wouldn't let it stop me staying again.

Luckily, in this case, any negative reviews were completely erased upon walking into the room. Now, first, I should let you know I paid, as near as makes no difference, \u00a350 for a superior double room with continental breakfast. Hence, excellent value. The room itself was small but cosy. There was excellent storage space for clothing et. al. and most importantly, in mid July, the climate control air conditioning was excellent, a quiet cool lulled me to an excellent nights sleep on a comfortable bed. The toilet and shower facilities were also quite small but, sufficient. Indeed, the shower was very modern and very good, and, as a larger gentleman, I had no trouble fitting into the room, fitting onto the toilet, fitting in the shower, leaning over the sink to brush my teeth. There was sufficient room and excellent facilities. There was also a kettle (or tea and coffee making facilities as they call it). Which leant itself well given that, after a day out in the city, we fancied a cuppa. The location of the hotel may be a tad inconvenient for some people who wish to stay in London, however it is a very short journey from Tower Gateway DLR station, to Customer House for eXcel DLR station, and the hotel itself is literally across the road from the exit of the DLR station, and I mean literally, you exit the stairs from the station and cross the road directly to the door of the hotel. It was a fantastic location for our purposes, and our off-peak travel cards for zones 1-4 (the hotel is in zone 3) was only \u00a36.30, 70p more than a zones 1-2 travel card. I must reiterate, this is off-peak travel cards, and peak travel card prices may vary. We also dined in the Ho Lee chinese restaurant within the hotel, and the food was lovely. Overall I would recommend this hotel for, mostly short breaks. If you are planning a weekend in London with your partner or, even on your own, and you aren't wishing to go pupping and clubbing late at night then you cannot go wrong with this hotel and, do search for the cheapest rates for this hotel because I found prices from \u00a349 to \u00a3115 for rooms at this hotel and, our room, which we paid \u00a354 for, was also available for \u00a3115, that's about \u00a360 difference, that's a whole other night.

The hotel itself was clean and basic with modern decor, our room and bathroom were huge with lots of space - we were given a double bed when we requested a twin room but we weren't too bothered, the main problem with the room was that it did have a strong smell of damp which really hit us each time we walked in. It was also quite noisy as we had a room at the front and could hear the noise/announcements from the DLR rain station from 6am onwards! We also found that the bed was quite hard and uncomfortable. It was quite out of the way for the city centre and I wouldnt recommend if you are coming to London just for sightseeing/ a night out as there is not much round the hotel to see/do except for the o2 and I felt a bit scared walking round the area especially at night! We used the tube to get into London a few times - this took about 20mins or so and was quite straightforward - however there was a tube strike whilst we were there with only one line running so we had to get a taxi from Euston which set us back \u00a340!

The idea was to get away and visit the sights of London. We booked the Hotel through 'Easy Breaks' which included return flights from Glasgow. The hotel is a little bit out of the center of London, which to be honest has us a little worried at first, but it sits directly opposite from the Custom EXCEL DLR (dockland Light Railway) Station. So getting in/Out of London was a breeze. The hotel is clean and tidy, staff were friendly. The rooms as previous reveiwers have stated are small. The toilet and shower are seperate in what can only be described as a posh portaloo!!, plastic set ups, no locks on the doors. However they did the job, and to be honest for what we paid for 3 nights B&B it was more than adequate. The beds were small, and we had to ask for extra pillows each, but no great hardship and we both slept on them fine (but I was glad to get back to my double kingsize!) Breakfast was coninental style with plentifull if not varied fare on offer. You can upgrade to full English for \u00a34. This I found hard to understand, as very few people actually did this (we did once) and as a result surely a lot of waste? There is a Cafe/Restruant, a Chinese and a pub within the hotel, the prices looked reasonable for a London Hotel, and we ate in the pub on the last night. Food was great, service was good, and plenty of it, for decent price. The drink prices was high though, about \u00a34 a pint which for 2 tight Scots was pretty high, but to be honest you can pay that in Glasgow, so it didn't shock us too much!. So to sum up folks, if your looking for a reasonably priced, clean hotel, and are not looking for 4 star Hilton Standards then this is just the job!.

There is a noticeably run-down feeling to anything north of Victoria Dock Road. There are only very limited amenities, in terms of shops and services, in the immediate vicinity and the neighbourhood does not feel safe enough for one to explore beyond this. We found ourselves simply dashing from the station back to the hotel on most nights. This security problem was compounded by the fact that the hotel restaurants were severely overpriced, so we found ourselves very limited in terms of eating options. On the plus side, you could not be closer to the DLR stop so access to central London is really quite easy.

Booking We booked through a value hotel website (bookings is the name). The room was \u00a359 a night which, compared with \u00a3100 or so for the bigger name hotels. The hotel's own website charged \u00a380 or so - therefore I recommend shopping around. Parking We drove down to London and used the hotel's own car park. They charge \"\u00a310 a day or part thereof\". We assumed as we were going to be there over a Saturday/Sunday we would be charged \u00a320 but they only charged us \u00a310. We were happy with the car park - as someone else mentioned, it's not the loveliest of areas and not worth the risk of parking in a side street in my opinion Rooms I'm sure there are large, airy rooms in this hotel. However, for \u00a359 we neither expected, nor got one of these. My husband remarked that it was probably the smallest hotel room he'd ever stayed in. The toilet was very VERY similar to those that you get on a plane - with plastic walls. The sink was in the corner of the room next to the bed. The shower, although built the same as the toilet was lovely and hot with a powerful head. The bed was extremely comfortable and we had tea/coffee facilities plus a tv. The room was NOT airconditioned. However, the heater worked and the room was toasty after about 10 minutes. If you know you only want to sleep in this room you will have no cause for complaints. Don't however, book yourself a romantic break here! Overall This is really a value hotel that we booked for convenience and price. In my opinion it gave us exactly what we were looking for.

On arriving at the hotel in this difficult location we were surprised how ''''''remote''''''' it was in the sense it is next to pretty much nothing. Once inside the hotel we were fairly impressed with the front desk as it looked new and well staffed. The employees however were as far removed from pleasant as you can get. NO customer service skills, NO pleasantries, NO manners and ZERO personality!! Before we could even catch out breath they were demanding a credit card to cover breakages, which was very off putting. Anyway we took our key and went to our room. On entering the room I genuinely though it was in memory of Jeremy Beadle. The room was smaller than my suitcase, rediculous and NOT what the website was selling. It had two twin beds the size of boxes in and extremely laughable!! The only good thing about the room was the bathroom and that too was a joke. For anyone with a mobility problem they were stuffed in regards to using the loo or shower. You basically had to mountaineer your way up a huge climb just to get inside this 'pod' which was literally a caravan bathroom dumped in a broom cupboard. Ok so the beds were comfy, bathroom clean and tv worked, for the money we paid I guess it really was not that bad. For the purpose of a quick trip it was more than suitable. BREAKFAST time. hmmm well the breakfast was actually delicious but they have a very regimented routine regarding brekfast. 2 LINES we were ordered. One for the standard continental breakfast and one for the cooked breakfast at an additional cost!!! The cafe closes very early or when the chef gets bored. The times change every night. If it is still open late they offer a dirt basic curry, which looked seriously off putting. !!! WARNING !!! WARNING !!! WARNING !!! WARNING !!! WARNING !!! DO NOT under any circumstances go out of this hotel in the dark and alone at night. The area is very dangerous. On two nights that we were there, drug offers were made.

After looking at a few hotels, we came across Custom House Hotel for \u00a349.95 per room, which was the cheapest hotel in that area on the day of our concert. We read the mixed reviews on Trip Advisor and decided that the more recent reviews seemed more promising than the earlier reviews and we confirmed our reservation through the website Laterooms.com. The hotel is situated right outside the Custom House DLR station which was great however there seemed to be building work happening outside the hotel which we weren\u2019t informed about when we made our booking. When we entered the hotel the receptionist checked us in quickly. She mentioned that we had to pay on departure but we had to provide a copy of our credit card details to confirm our stay at the hotel which translated to me as payment in case we decided to do a runner! We asked the obvious question of \u201cwhat approximate times do the builders start/finish every day?\u201d and the hotel staff said they didn\u2019t know. Personally I felt it was a question a lot of people would have asked considering it was happening at the hotel and felt they should have had at least a rough idea. Thankfully it didn\u2019t really affect us as we were out in the evening and were leaving the next morning. The reception had lots of information for attractions and also a vending machine with handy items for guests during their stay such as toothbrushes, hair gel etc. The room we were given was a superior double room which sleeps 2 with breakfast not included. The room was en-suite, spacious, air-conditioned and clean. The beds were clean and comfortable and had 2 pillows with a spare pillow and blanket in the draws under the bed. The room had a wardrobe with hangers and a safe in the bottom of it which they hotel charges 2 GBP to use. There were tea and coffee facilities in the room with some biscuits, a TV with basic channels (BBC1 + 2, ITV, Channel 4, Five + TMF music channel), telephone, hairdryer, travel adapter & internet access which the hotel charged 15.00 GBP!!!!! The bathroom was quite clean apart from the toilet seat which had a rather unpleasant stain on it. The hotel provided us with shampoo, soap & a shaving port. The shower cubicle was pretty small as quite a few reviewers have mentioned but it wasn\u2019t really a problem. We checked out at 11am and we had to wait a short while but reception apologised for the wait and proceeded in checking us out. Unfortunately they decided to charge me more than I was quoted on the website. Thankfully I printed out my Laterooms reservation and showed them how much I was quoted and after a quick chat with her manager, the receptionist said they were willing to charge me the price I was originally quoted. Overall our stay at the hotel was a pleasant one especially as the hotel was close to the DLR station and a short train journey to the O2 Arena and at a cost of 49.95 GBP it was worth the price.", "Date": "November 8, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "2", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "1", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "London, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cBad value for money\u201d", "Author": "Katieflossom", "ReviewID": "UR21093082", "Content": "I had to stay at this hotel as I was attending an event at ExCel for work purposes.

Now the bad points - there is nothing close by to the hotel except ExCel, so you have no choice but to eat at the hotel restaurant which is very overpriced (\u00a38 for a burger and chips.) The room STANK of cigerette smoke, and it was obvious that someone next door was smoking even though it was a n/s hotel. i had to complain twice, but they continued and weren't removed from the hotel. The walls were paper thin and I could hear the next room shouting down their phone at 6am. The room was boiling hot, even when the aircon was on full and the windows were sealed shut.

Space is limited however, and I certainly would not have wanted to leave my car 'on street' locally. The in house pub/cafe is good, food and drinks not expensive at all for London, and the staff are efficient and pleasant. The Chinese restaurant (The HO Lee) is a hidden gem, and a credit to all concerned. If prices seem a little high at first glance don't be put off - the food is of the best standard imaginable and the portions are generous to put it mildly, and served by some of the most attentive, efficient and friendly staff I have personally encountered in a very long time. My room provided an ever changing view - a real plane, train and bus spotter's paradise! With the double-glazed window closed the associated noise issue was not a problem however, and the air-conditioning more than coped with the heat-wave conditions at the time. My only real moan?? The pathetic, almost thin to the point of being transparent, poorly fitting curtains.

Something I have never seen before was the security guard patroling the hallway (knocking on doors then entering?)Funnily enough that did not make us feel safe. It just alarmed me that it was necessary. The smell of damp in the bathroom wasnt being kept at bay despite the fan running all night.

Location We were at an event at the ExCel arena and this hotel cannot be faulted for location, it is literally across the road. I think it is the nearest hotel to the arena, which meant no messing around with taking tubes or parking. The hotel is located in a dodgy run down East End area. I chose to park my car on Ethel Street, which is directly behind the hotel, although I did so apprehensively.

Staff When we checked in, I encountered a strange situation. The receptionist presented me with a printed bill, which I found odd because I had already paid \u00a360 for the room through an Internet site a week previously. When I saw the new bill came to \u00a335, I was a little perturbed to say the least.

Although angry about being charged almost double the price, I would have settled for the truth rather than a lie. The restaurant and cleaning staff were efficient, but don't expect decent service or even a conversation from them. Food The Custom House Hotel's idea of continental breakfast is a choice of three cereals, orange juice, tap water, machine coffee, yoghurt and cheap bread, which was adequate but they're not going to get any Michelin stars here.

It is situated 2 minutes from the DLR and it took me 15 minutes to get to Bank station \u2013 my review was based on a three night stay in a superior room - overall think an above average Travelodge room", "Date": "September 21, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "1", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "Riverside, CA", "Title": "\u201cDon't do it!\u201d", "Author": "Ace4294", "ReviewID": "UR5764759", "Content": "Wow! Where to start?? Yes, it's true that this hotel is located across from the rail station......but it is a good 30 min ride to the center of London and it involves a switch to the tube. This hotel is too far away from anything! The neighborhood around it is very depressed with boarded up buildings and lots of trash everywhere. The room itself is ok.....except for no A/C and a very strange pre-fab bathroom. Kind of like you'd expect to find in a motorhome. The breakfast was ok but nothing special. I would never stay here again because it is just too far from ANY attraction. If you're spending so much money to visit London...why stay in a location so far removed from anything to see? There is nothing to do here at night and it didn't really look safe to venture out at night anyway. This hotel is so far from London that the morning we were leaving our bus driver was 45 minutes late because he couldn't even find the hotel. Don't stay here. I'm sure you can do better just about anywhere else!", "Date": "September 3, 2006"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Custom House Hotel", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g186338-d248796-Reviews-Custom_House_Hotel-London_England.html", "Price": "$93 - $310*", "Address": "<address> <span rel=\"v:address\"> <span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">272-283 Victoria Dock Road</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:locality\">London</span> <span property=\"v:postal-code\">E16 3BY</span></span>, <span class=\"country-name\" property=\"v:country-name\">England</span> </span> </span> </address>", "HotelID": "248796", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/ProviderThumbnails/dirs/09/b0/09b02de43ee2a9b517670b52d989f2757large.jpg"}}
