Rooms are okay but stink of cigarettes and carpets are old and dirty. Having stayed in a lot of hotels, this was certainly the worst in Turkey. As in many other shops, restaurants and hotels, staff was helpful only when it came to basic things. The most amazing thing was the total lack of any service once payment was made. We turned from being their guests to being invisible. One of the managers was good though everyone else seemed to think they are doing you a favor. The location is quite odd. We took this as this was near to the bus station/ Otogar but, in reality, it's hard to get there because of the big roads, probably highways, and far off pedestrian crossings. You will need a taxi to go anywhere even if it is across the road, unless you are okay with spending 15 minutes figuring out where to cross and how to go. When asked for help, staff simply said, \"Take a taxi.\" They seem to get quite a few tour groups and Turkish Airline passengers so maybe that's the reason for the indifference.

The main reason why we chose this hotel is because it is about 15mins walk to the Bayrampasa Bus Terminal where we headed to take a bus to Safranbolu the very next day - and we wanted to just rest after a 11-hour flight from Singapore to Istanbul. We requested for early check-in at 6am via email but was told that early check-in would only be granted if we pay 20 euros per person for breakfast. Finding this rather ridiculous, we decided to just let it be and settle the issue when we were there. On the day of our arrival at the hotel, upon telling the staff of our room reservation, we were greeted with a \"this is not my problem. your check-in time is at 12pm\". We understand that it is unusual for early check-in at 6am but it would be much appreciated if the hotel staff could provide us with a solution (such as paying extra for early check-in) instead of just saying \"this is not my problem\". After much debate, we managed to get a room for the 4 of us to rest till 12pm - a sigh of relief. With the poor service aside, the hotel rooms are spotless and splendid. Beds are soft and comfy with nice flat screen TV. Breakfast is excellent too with quite a wide selection of bread. The service was also much better on the very next day when we were checking out, so it could be that the hotel staff was over stressed on the day we arrived - with all due respect, he's quite an old man after all =) All in all, if you are looking for a hotel that's quiet, near to bus station and away from all the hussle and bussle, Grand S Hotel would be a perfect choice! If you want to stay near all the attractions, I'm sure you can find something more suitable inside Sultanahmet area =)", "Date": "January 2, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "2", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "London, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cNot recommended\u201d", "Author": "efesmurat", "ReviewID": "UR120774282", "Content": "This hotel is too far from everything but main bus terminal.Rooms are ok for a three to four star hotel.Services are below Turkish standards .watch out if you are crossing the road as it is not that easy.Breakfast is ok.I would stay elsewhere unless i had business in this particular neighborhood and if i couldn't effort crown plaza hotel next door.", "Date": "November 19, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Cairo, Egypt", "Title": "\u201cvery helpful staff,nice food and convenient prices\u201d", "Author": "ahmed h", "ReviewID": "UR119080129", "Content": "i came over on 1 oct 2011 for my honeymoon and i really enjoyed my stay very much although it is little bit far from some places but the metro made really very easy as it was across the street and be careful from the restaurant beside the hotel it gives different prices every day although the ordered food is the same!!! beside the hotel there are many restaurants and markets in case you need any thing and it is worthy to mention that the hotel food was great and with same prices as outside Special thanks to the front office team specially (MOURAD) as he guided me to many lovely unforgettable tours and instructed me how to get to metro and other lovely places. i would love to come again thats for sure", "Date": "October 8, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "London, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cnice hotel but too many rules\u201d", "Author": "awesomealanya", "ReviewID": "UR115527025", "Content": "stayed here for daughters 18th birthday, lovely modern hotel but a fair distance from the sights, breakfast fab even for veggies, we had problems wiv pool as you must buy swim hat a 10 lira each and dont bother with the gym unless you have proper clothes with you! be careful of room service as some staff are perverts,we found food in restaurant next door cheap and great, try it!", "Date": "July 19, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cBrilliant stay!
