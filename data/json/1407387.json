I have experienced other high-end hotels in Hong Kong and this one was equivalent in d\u00e9cor, comfort and services. The hotel was in like-new condition. With blonde woods and large windows, the rooms were very bright and airy. The small surcharge for a harbor view was well worth it. This was especially true in the hot summer because the sun rises over the harbor, leaving the room cooler in the late afternoon. Before arriving at the hotel I didn\u2019t like concept of a glass wall between the bathroom and the bedroom but ended up appreciating it for making the bathroom bright and open \u2013 not the usual cave. Service was usually good and the staff seemed sincerely considerate. I was told that this hotel is a teaching site for the adjacent University which would explain both the earnest young staff and the occasional minor errors. When calling the service line, most times it was answered immediately (unlike many hotels where it rings and rings). The food, both restaurant and room service, was quite good. The buffets had enormous variety including sushi station, roast meats carving station, pasta station, dim sum selection and dessert station where they made crepes or sundaes to your order. In contrast to other hotels, the same meal cost about 10% less for room service than in the restaurant (both had a 10% service charge). My local relatives mentioned that the restaurant has a reputation for quality. The main downside to the hotel was that its location was inconvenient getting to Central or TST. The MTR East Rail line station was right next to the hotel but it took at least 2 transfers to get to Central and maybe 30-40 minutes depending on the time of day. Taxi to Kowloon station was HKD135 and probably HKD200 to Central. Aside from the MTR station and a new building for the Chinese University Business School, there were no shops or anything else in the immediate vicinity of the hotel. On the other hand, the room rates were significantly cheaper and the charges for meals and laundry were about 25% less than the centrally-located hotels. (Shirts and slacks were impeccably done by their laundry service but it always arrived about a half hour after the promised 6pm delivery deadline.) The hotel has good promotions \u2013 I was upgraded to a huge one bedroom, 1.5 bath suite for the price of a normal room. The suite had 6 telephones, a small refrigerator, microwave and dishes, cups and glasses (no stove). Some other details: At the airport, get in the line for a green taxi as the hotel is in the New Territories. It cost HKD260 (would be somewhat more with guests and luggage) and took about 30 minutes. Breakfast buffet was HKD228 and dinner buffet was HKD428 (468 on weekends), plus 10% service. They didn\u2019t have a good selection of vegetarian items, particularly on the menu, but the hotel said they would look into adding more. My suite had a Nespresso machine with 4 regular pods and 2 decaff pods. Two bottles of water were provided. The water and coffee were free and replenished daily. The in-room safe was large \u2013 a large laptop would fit along with papers and accessories. There was a charge for broadband wired internet \u2013 I paid HKD550 for a week\u2019s access. The internet worked well and was never out, even during a level 10 typhoon. Local calls were HKD6. The bathroom had the usual shaver electric outlet that was intended to fit both U.S. 2-prong flat blades and Euro 2-prong round plugs \u2013 the U.S. plug didn\u2019t fit so I used a Euro 2-prong adapter. The other outlets in the room were for the big U.K. 3-prong plugs. One adapter was provided on the desk so I could plug in my U.S. laptop.

Nice modern hotel, as would be expected from a Hyatt. It is a very short walk from the mtr (university station) so getting into town is not a huge effort, takes about 25 mins but you go have to change lines. Pool bar food is lovely, club sandwich and the squid are both worth eating, didn't eat anything else in the hotel as we ate in town or cooked ourselves as my husbands appt has a small kitchenette. Supermarket is nearby in shatin which is 2 stops south on the mtr, this shopping ctr also has loads of other shops. I didn't go north. Big negative was lack of anything around the hotel that didn't involve public transport, there is a small 7/11 at the mtr station so other than basic snacks it was a bit of a job to have to pop out for anything. The 0pool bar staff were amazing in particular a really nice lady who's name I can't remember. One of the bar managers really went out if his way for us one night too. prices for drinks and food is as would be expected, High, even more than many of the central hotels we went to for drinks which I guess is down To lack of competition locally. Room (1 bed appt) is big and fairly well stocked for short stay, not really so well stocked for long stay, the kitchen lacked thought and with the long stay equipment added ie microwave and hot plate it left literally no room at all to prepare or serve food up onto plates sobyou end up with half the prep in the lounge, and kitchen equipment plugged in at various places around the lounge.

The hotel is situated close to the Tolo Highway and offers views over the Tolo Harbour. The taxi-drive (between HK$220 - $HK270; I forgot the exact fare...) from the airport took between 25 and 35 minutes. Be sure to take a green taxi since only those taxi's drive to the New Territories. A MTR station is located directly next to the hotel, it is called \"University\" and is part of the East Rail Line (light blue). So It is also possible to reach the hotel by MTR but I would not recommend that since you have to interchange a few times to get on the right line and the particular line is quite busy. I would recommend to buy an Octopus Card which is useable at all forms of public transport throughout Hong Kong, another advantage of the card is that you can pay with it at a lot of stores, such as 7Eleven, Cirkle K, Starbucks, etc. Since the MTR station is located next to the hotel, getting to the Hong Kong city centre is quite easy, but takes some time. To, for example, reach the \"Tsim Sha Tsui\" station, you have to interchange twice. First you take the East Rail Line (light blue) to \"Kowloon Tong\" there you interchange on the Kwun Tong Line (bright green) and interchange once more at the \"Prince Edward\" station to the Tsuen Wan Line (red). Reaching this station will take around 20 minutes. In the other way the MTR extends all the way to the connection with the Shenzen MTR, so that's quite nice if you want to visit Shenzen. Just two stops from the \"University\" station, at the \"Sha Tin\" station, is a shopping mall which is called New Town Plaza. It offers a wide range of shops and restaurants and is spread over multiple wings. In New Town Plaza I it is usually quite busy, for more peace go to New Town Plaza III, there are also more restaurants :). We wanted to know in advance what the cancellation policy was if you book at the Hyatt website itself since that was not clearly stated. We also wanted to know if we would be charged for an extra bed if we booked through Hyatt itself. So I sent an e-mail to the hotel and I friendly got answer. Cancellation policy is the first night + 10% if you cancel after 2:00 pm the day before arrival. Since I got no answer about the extra bed, we booked the first night through Agoda and would ask at the hotel itself and then further extend our stay with two more nights. Upon arrival at the hotel the bellboy will take your luggage and assist you to check-in. Upon our arrival there was no available employee at the front desk. Instead of waiting there immediately came an employee who checked us in. We booked for one night the day before arrival by Agoda, and should book the second and third night after arrival. When we checked in, the employee could not find our reservation so he had to check with the Agoda website. He politely asked us if we would take place in the lobby and resume check in after he checked with Agoda and made a new reservation for the second and third night after we mentioned that we would like to stay three nights, these were booked through Hyatt itself and the rate was more or less the same as through Agoda. It took about 10 minutes before he had sorted it out. Nevertheless, check-in was very convenient. One minor drawback was that after check-in we heared the roomnumber but nobody directed us to our room, we were supposed to search it ourselfs, we did not even know on which floor we were situated (although that was easy to deduct from the room number). The bellboy brought the luggage after we entered the room. The staff upon arrival and check-in were very kind, polite and helpful. The lobby area is small but cosy with a few seats and direct access to the restaurant for breakfast and dinner (don't know if they also serve lunch, probably it is all day dining). There are some shops at your lefthand side and the concierge is located at your righthand side. At the concierge you can get some free maps of Hong Kong and they are quite helpful when you have questions about certain services. Opposite from the concierge there are some mirrors at the wall on which you can leave a message and on which the weather forecast for the particular day is drawn. Very nice. Elevators can only be operated to go up when in posses of a valid key card for a room, that is a quite nice security feature :). We booked a Mountain View Twin room with extra bed. I don't know which rooms are Mountain View and which are Harbour View but we looked over water with mountains in the back instead of just mountains. I actually enjoyed this view more than if we got a room with just mountain view. The room was 38 square meter and had modern and contemperory furniture. The beds for example were kinda floating above the floor. An power adapter was already available in the room. The beds were good and quite soft with good and firm pillows. The room features airconditioning which is slightly personalisable, but not so much, it's just okay :). There is a range of magazines available in your room and a LCD TV is also present with quite a lot channels. There is also a glass desk and a cable which can be used to connect to the internet, there is also wireless internet available in each room. The internet is very expensive in this hotel, one hour internet costs HK$80, a day pass costs HK$150. I think internet should be complementary. There were some little maintenance issues in the room, for example near the desk the wall was damaged. There was also a gap in the linen of the extra bed, this may not happen. This needs to be fixed but probably is not seen by maintenance staff. There was also a booklet with all the information and services about the hotel, but this was ripped...quite strange that this was not replaced. The minibar was empty, but that was okay, so we could use it for our own stuff. When some people were in the corridor at night and they were talking, we could quite clearly hear them, not so plesant if you want to sleep. Housekeeping did not refill the complementary coffee and tea, so we had to ask for it one night. Housekeeping also did not switch our linen even though we did put the \"Change my linen\"-card on the bed. The bathroom was quite big and featured a sink with mirror and all standard amenities as well as a bathtub, separate toilet and separate rainshower. I really like the rainshower! Our toilet featured a quite strong urine odour, don't know where it came from but it was persistent most of the time. The door rubber on the door to the shower was also ripped/broken/weak. Had the impression that housekeeping does not clean the (bathroom)floors every day since during our complete stay some hairs were on the floor, quite dirty; I did not expect this from a five star hotel. The hotel also has a pool, it is located on level M, just as the fitness room and business centre. Actually, you have to go by elevator to level M, then change in the changingrooms, walk through the fitness room and go down by elevator to the lobby level (separate elevator that only runs between M and L), the pool is located outside at the backside of the hotel and offers a nice view on the mountains. We did not try the pool since the pool was closed on the evening we wanted to take a dive due to thunderstorms. Check out was also rather quick and there were plenty of taxi's to the airport which can be arranged through the hotel (just normal taxi's). So to wrap up: this hotel is very good but all the small maintenance problems lead to a lower rating than I did expect since it is a five star hotel. If they solve the problems, then it's a truly five star hotel with a beautiful location just out of the busy city but also quite close to the city centre. I would surely recommend this hotel to my friends.", "Date": "July 25, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Hong Kong, China", "Title": "\u201cExcellent hospitality and customer service :)\u201d", "Author": "Arryan", "ReviewID": "UR134531962", "Content": "Stayed for 2 peaceful and well rested nights.

First of all, let me comment about the customer service I received for the hotel booking. I was booking the room through Hyatt website but at payment confirmation page, my card was not getting accepted because the booking system accepts cards with maximum expiry year of 2019 only. Hence online booking was not possible for me. I called the reservation on phone and they in turn connected me to central reservation desk where the person proceeded to collect my card details and informed kindly that I do not need to make a prepayment until I arrive at the hotel even though the room I was booking was on \"Advance Purchase - Full prepayment\" offer only. Well, I was very much impressed by this gesture. And a note to those who read this - \"Hyatt Sha Tin has one of the cheapest rates for a 5 star hotel in Hong Kong\". Upon arrival at the hotel, I was pleasantly surprised to get a room upgrade to Harbour View King and the check in process hardly took around 10 minutes.

I had actually wanted to stay at the other Hyatt Regency, the one in Tsim Sha Tsui due to its excellent location, but the rate was prohibitively expensive that I thought it really wasn't worth it for a 20-hour stay where I didn't really need to go anywhere. This was my 6th stay at this property so I was somewhat familiar with the hotel. I took a cab from/to the airport and it was around HKD300 each way and the journey took about 30 minutes. Upon arrival, the front desk staff escorted me to the Regency Club lounge for check-in. Being a Diamond member, I was always upgraded to a bigger Club room although never to a room with a Harbor view. Unusually, the hotel has many different kinds of room layouts and if I remember correctly, I've been in about 5 different kind of rooms. The staff in the lounge was polite and some were friendlier than others. Service during happy hour was just ok though, the staff didn't clear the table often and never proactively offered to top up drinks or bring more hot food, etc. The happy hour was from 5-8 pm, which I thought was pretty generous, and the spread was quite good and there were a couple of hot items you could order off a menu. The service during breakfast was much much better with friendly and attentive staff who couldn't do enough. There was an egg dish that was made to order and also at least 3 types of congee. The lounge itself is fairly big, with great views of the Tolo Harbor and also a semi-outdoor terrace. The hotel provides free shuttle bus services to and from Shatin town and Tsim Sha Tsui at regular intervals. Although the bus tends to be packed quite quickly, so it pays to be at the bus stop early. Otherwise, TST is about 30 minutes by MTR and the Chinese border at Lo Wu is also about 20 minutes by train. They also used to have a direct bus service from the airport to the hotel and vice versa, so the hotel was really convenient for short transit stays when I didn't need to go to the city. Unfortunately, they had since discontinued this service, so the hotel became less attractive to me. But overall, this is a good value hotel, if you don't mind the extra commute time. Overall, it was a good stay. Most likely I wouldn't have stayed there if I needed to be in the city as the location was really out of the way, but for this stay where I really didn't need to go anywhere it was just perfect. After adding the cab fare from/to the airport, the overall price I paid was still less than half of what I would've had to pay had I stayed at the HR TST.", "Date": "June 2, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Ravenna, Italy", "Title": "\u201cHard to decide!\u201d", "Author": "masifk", "ReviewID": "UR130399679", "Content": "The Hyatt Regency Sha Tin is located outside the city, its at least 20 mins away from Hong Kong.

There is even a free shuttle to the other Hyatt located in the shopping district of Tsim Sha Tsui in downtown Hong Kong. The hotel itself is well built, modern & sophisticated. It seemed almost new when I stayed there so I dont know how old it is, but everything was very modern, well kept & clean. The rooms are large, very well made & up to the Hyatt standards. The food is good as well, & I dont know if it seemed reasonably priced to me because of the value of the Hong Kong Dollar or because it was actually cheap compared to other hotels? You be the judge & try it out yourself. Great hotel, great stay, but...is it worth staying so far away from the city? Is it worth spending up to 30 mins on the metro to reach any of the sights & attractions? I guess it depends on how much money you are willing to spend on a hotel. The hotels in the city are not cheap, & compared to the Hyatt Sha Tin are a lot more expensive even if its a three or four star hotel. So it pretty much depends on how you want to spend your money I guess.

The hotel is also located at Tolo Harbour, a rather scenic place and the hotel even provides bicycles for rent to cycle along the harbour. Our stay at the Hyatt Regency Sha Tin did not start off smoothly as the bellhop was arrogant and snobbish and the checking in took at least 45 minutes, at one moment, one receptionist processed the checking in then left us waiting until another receptionist took over and redo the check in. The room was spacious and the bed was very comfortable. There is one problem though: the bathroom door lock was not working. The service at the Hyatt Regency Sha Tin was inconsistent, the people working at the gym were very friendly and helpful and the Front Desk Manager was courteous too. However, the staf at the cafe and the entrance were one of the worst I have experienced in my travels. Included in our package was an afternoon tea and breakfast. Both of which were unimpressive but there was decent variety of food. The teriyaki yakitori served during afternoon tea for example tasted like packaged food heat up in a microwave and the scrambled eggs for breakfast was overdone and tasteless. The bicycles were a nice touch but they seriously need some servicing, some of the brakes are not working and certain parts are rusty. As for other facilties, I enjoyed the gym and outdoor heated-pool. If you can afford the Club Room, the Club Lounge has an amazing view of the Tolo Harbour. The location is not ideal if you plan to explore Central Hong Kong but a good base for exploring the New Territories and perhaps Shenzhen as the railway line can easily bring you there. The hotel's location itself doesn't has much to explore besides the harbour. Overall, the hotel fell way below my expectations for a five star hotel, and the entrance staff being the frontline of the hotel, gave a very poor showing. Nonetheless, Hyatt Regency Sha Tin did responded to my feedback months later with an apology for the poor service and conditions on the bicycle and explained that they charge for the internet because not every guest wants it (hence room rates would be cheaper).", "Date": "May 12, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201c5 star best value for money\u201d", "Author": "Crystalperido", "ReviewID": "UR129009085", "Content": "A bit off the beaten track but not really an inconvenient location.

This has proven to be a very good hotel choice for our guests (and us) for a variety of reasons. First, the quality of the rooms is very good. While being slightly more functional and less luxurious than some of its peers in central HK, the rooms are still very good (new and modern). We really like the large, soft king sized beds that give a great night sleep. The room and bathroom sq. footage is of western standard and we love the large bath tub which has a view to the room television, through the glass bathroom (there is also a sliding screen as well when discretion requires. Views of the mountain and harbor are both good as well. Second, we also like the very competitive price for this Hyatt hotel, which is significantly less due to its location, which interestingly enough is just 20-25 minutes from some of HK's major attractions and just 33 minutes to TST and 38 minutes to Central via MTR, which is a 3 minute walk to the hotel, just next door (University MTR). In particular, we enjoy being able to take our guests to Man Fat Tsz - 10,000 buddha monastery (Sha Tin MTR - 5 minutes), Sha Tin Racecourse (3 minutes by Taxi) and the wonderful Chi Lin Nunnery and Nan Lian Gardens (26 minutes to Diamond Hill MTR). The excellent History of Hong Kong Museum (18 minutes to Hung Hom MTR) and Mong Kok Markets (18 minutes to Mongkok East MTR) also demonstrate how the location of this hotel effects your travel around Hong Kong much less than you might think due to the excellent MTR system we have in HK. What we also like about the Hyatt Regency is the nice outdoor pool, the good gym, ok spa and good dining options. The Cafe at Hyatt has a decent international buffet and serves nice menu dinner items. They offer a American breakfast (HK$220) room service that is large enough for two people and will set up in your room, like a breakfast table. This is great when put up next to your window, overlooking the harbor or mountain. The Sha Tin 18 restaurant, which is a very attractive restaurant, has very good (but pricey) dim sum selection as well as an outdoor patio dining area for those interesting in a nice dinner. There is also a very good hotel lounge bar, called the Tin Tin Bar, which serves standard, reasonably priced drinks, 2 for 1 happy hour, and some nice snacks. Overall, we've been very pleased with this hotel over the past couple years and have stayed here ourselves when wanting an relax in an affordable five star hotel in Hong Kong.

But Hyatt in Shatin offers a really decent price for people to enjoy the five-star luxury while paying only at four-star with a trade-off of relatively far distance from the downtown. But actually it's not a big big drawback given the hotel is only 5 mins walk to University MTR station. Since we are on a transit from Taiwan to mainland of China, we arrived at the hotel from the airport which is quite easy by taking the airport bus A41, which only costs 22.3HKD at the time of writing. The bus will stop at Shatin City Center and another two stops MTR will make you into the hotel lobby in totally less than one hour. And from the hotel to Monkok shopping center is also less than half an hour with convenient public transport. So unless you are having a business trip with meetings in the downtown of HK, for travelling purpose there is no downside of living in Shatin, such a quite a lovely place. The room is quite spacious, clean and every details proves it's five star quality. They have provided almost everything you needed but you might forget such as the elec adaptor. Also there are several latest magazines in the room for people read. The tub is separated with a glass window that you can literally watching TV which taking relax.

Hyatt Sha Tin would stand out in this respect. If you want some peace and quiet do go to Hyatt Sha Tin. I had a mountain-view king size bedroom that was at least the size of a 2 bedroom apartment on the 15th floor. Fantastic view to wake up to. The bed was really comfortable and we had a choice of pillows to choose from. Huge room (can't say that enough); sofa set and coffee table made the room service dining experience great. There is a separate bathroom, toilet and bathtub area which is convenient for families travelling together. I had asked for a quiet room as I was a light sleeper and I did not hear any noise from the weddings that took place when I was there. I was there during a public holiday season and there were at least 2 wedding couples that we saw in the hotel during our stay. Contrary to what other reviewers mentioned in this review, there were no loud parties. The service at the hotel is impeccable. We dined in most of the days that we were there and found the breakfast and the dinner to be really good. Nothing was too difficult or unusual. We ended up ordering vegetarian fried rice, which was not on the menu as we loved it so much. Do dine at the Sha Tin restaurant at least once when you are there. The food and the view are amazing. There is a wide range of food (both western and Chinese) in the breakfast buffet and its worth taking a room with breakfast. There is a deli on the ground lobby where you can get pastries and coffee on the go. We were pleasantly surprised to find out that they also offered some spa services to children such as the \u2018dainty feet massage\u2019, which was a welcome relief for sore feet tired from walking endlessly in Disneyland. Their Jacuzzi and sauna rooms are spacious and you have attentive staff at hand to help you with your needs. One person you must look out for at Hyatt Sha Tin is Mr Ryan Mok. He is articulate, compassionate and approachable. He is knowledgeable about Disneyland and all the sights we had to see in Hong Kong. I was amazed at his ability to reel off the timings for all the shows and about all the sights around Hong Kong. A perfect concierge if you ask me. I did tease him about not sleeping at all as he was always there when we left the hotel or returned to the hotel. He greeted us by name and definitely knew his job well. He is exceptionally good with children and quickly became my son\u2019s favourite person to look out for. Do look out/ask for him when you need any advice about Hong Kong right down to the best places to dine, place to get medication and to shop. No doubts, he is the face of Hyatt! The hotel is away from the city and Disneyland. Disneyland is about 25-30 mins by taxi. Taxi charges are very reasonable in Hong Kong. The city is about 20 mins away. If you are going to the outlet mall (Citygate) and to see the Big Budda it will also be about 30 mins. Hence you are not as far away from the city as the other reviewers have mentioned. The tram station is barely 3 mins away from the hotel and you can choose to buy a first class ticket (where you will get a seat) to the nearest mall- Sha Tin- which is 2 stations (3 mins) away. The hotel is next to Chinese University of Hong Kong. Hence there are several dining options there as well. Take note that Hong Kong is very crowded on any given day. The sales are great but the crowds are a challenge for anyone travelling with children. Do book your tickets for the cable car to the big Budda online and get the crystal cabin which is less subscribed than the standard cable. But it is always a shorter queue and you get a view of what\u2019s below you too. On the whole, the hotel is by and large expensive but it\u2019s worth every penny! The staff never say \u2018no\u2019 (hence I am surprised at another reviewer\u2019s comment about this hotel) and all our requests and special meals were catered to, exceptionally well. Hence, you do get your money\u2019s worth.

Once we finally got the room we had booked, we spent a pretty poor first night in the room as a lot of noise could be heard from the neighbours from what seemed to be a wedding party. The next morning, i asked for the aircon to be left on, but as this was impossible, I asked for the windows to be opened during the day so as to air the room. when we got back around 10pm, the room smelled fresh, we only realized later that both windows were still open and were letting in the noise of the passing MTR so I had to call reception at about 0130 am so they could close the windows using a special key!

This is a great option if you are visiting the Chinese University of Hong Kong or attending a local conference (as I was), but that is really the only real reason to be here. There is nothing around this hotel except for a small variety store and a couple of restaurants for students or commuters. You can walk to the waterfront in a few minutes for some nice views, but the immediate area does not have any specific sights, stores, restaurants or other facilities. You need to take the train or a taxi to go anywhere - of course this is very easy to do, but you can find hotel options that will provide you with much easier opportunities to explore Hong Kong.

The hotel is relatively big, with over 500 rooms (133 of them are for long stay). I stayed there for 4 nights in October 2011. + + The Location + + The hotel is located in an area called The University in New Territories Hong Kong. It is not actually in Sha Tin as the hotel name suggested. Sha Tin is another suburb from the hotel and it is 2 train stations away from The University station. The nearest shopping centre from the hotel is in Shatin which can be reached by scheduled hotel shuttle, or by MTR train or by taxi. Access to/from the hotel: 1. By MTR train - The hotel is about 5 minute walk from the MTR station \"The University\" which can then take you to most part of Hong Kong including the Hong Kong island, Disneyland, Hong Kong airport, Shatin, Kowloon and ShenZheng China. 2. By Hotel Shuttle - There is one hotel shuttle mini-bus travelling to/from the hotel, Shatin, Kowloon MTR and Kowloon Hyatt Hotel. The mini-bus is free but they are not frequent and there is no space for the luggage. It has limited seats and they do not accept reservation. 3. By Taxi - Taxi are almost always ready on stand-by outside the hotel. 4. By Bus - The local bus terminal is next to the MTR station but it only goes to the suburban areas. As a rough guide, it will take you about 45 min. by taxi to the airport, 15 min to Shatin and 30 min to Kowloon, 45 min to Hong Kong Island. + + The Hotel + + This 5 star hotel has 2 restaurants, 1 for the buffet next to the lobby and another one specialised in Chinese food. It also has a pool bar and a 5 star fitness centre which has a separate male/female spa, a sauna room, a steam room as well as a gym and an outdoor swimming pool. The fitness centre is a rare find in Hong Kong and we enjoyed the relaxing atmosphere. The lobby is good but not grand although seats are limited (which is disappointing) There are only 3 lifts to the room and they are mostly full during busy hours (another disappointment) + + The Room + + The room is very clean and is very new when we were there. We stayed in the Harbour View Twin Roomwhich is still a good size with 40 sq metres for the Hong Kong standard. The room over look the Shatin harbour which is a blessing. The room design is modern with a huge glass window (with curtain) from the bathroom overlooking the room and the harbour. Shower and toilet have separate doors. Inside the room you can find everything a 5 star hotel have. Good quality bathroom amenities, big wardrobes and safe are all standard. Flat LCD TV with cable TV channels. Two telephones (one in the bathroom), an umbrella, a fridge, a power plug adoptor and a writing desk. + + The Restaurant + + There are 2 restaurants, the one near the lobby serves buffet style international food. The chinese restaurant called Shatin 21 serves traditional cantonese chinese food. On the weekend, the bar next to the swimming pool also serves BBQ buffet dinner. Food is great and service is excellent. Nonetheless, unless your room rates include the meal, price is also 5 stars - i.e,. expensive. ** Things I like about this hotel ** 1. The Fitness Centre - The spa, the sauna, the steam room, big changing room and they are not stingy with the towels and bathroom amenities. 2. The Swimming Pool - With a Bar - Very relaxing. 3. The Price - Cheaper than other 5 stars hotel in Hong Kong most of the time but you get the same quality. 4. The Location - It is next to the MTR station. 5. The free shuttle bus. ** Things I don't like about this hotel ** 1. The Location - It is still far from many Hong Kong attractions even the hotel is right next to the MTR station. 2. The Lift - The lifts can be full easily. ===== Overall ===== If you do not mind the traveling time, then this hotel is a bargin for the 5 star quality it has. My Tip - There is a fast food style chinese restaurant called Maxi next to the MTR station if you prefer the non-5 star.", "Date": "October 24, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "1", "Location": "1", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "New York City, New York", "Title": "\u201cAn overpriced mirage with a quagmire of hidden fees beneath it\u201d", "Author": "deorr", "ReviewID": "UR119548163", "Content": "The accomodations at the Hyatt Regency Sha Tin are gorgeous, but are marred by hidden fees and mediocre service.

Expect a cab ride of $150 to $300 HKD each time you want to return to the hotel past 10pm. As for the service, it was unremarkable except for the business center, which was terrible. The hotel apparently chose the middle of a work day to do some sort of construction project that required loud drilling. Someone's kid was running around the room and screaming.

The rooms were spacious, comfortable, clean and I had a nice view over the harbour.

Some earlier reviews had mentioned that there is a glass wall/large window between the bathroom and the bedroom, this is true but there is also a blind which you can easily put down, and there is total privacy as the shower and toilet are in separate cublicles anyway. I actually liked this feature is it makes the room feel even larger and brings natural light into the bathroom if you opt to keep the blind up. I ate at the Sha Tin 18 restaurant on the 1st night. It was pricey but delicious and I loved the decor. I also had a very nice cocktail or two in the 'Tin Tin' bar which has a dark sophisticated black and red colour theme, and had some nice but unobtrusive live music. The breakfast buffet each morning was fantastic with a huge choice of Chinese and western options. My only complaint was the black tea which was poured from a pot rather than freshly prepared. It didn't taste great, would be better if they gave you the tea bag and hot water to make your own. I later found out that this is the training hotel for CUHK's Hotel and Tourism Management degree programme and they certainly do a good job.

It is a lovely hotel for a Hong Kong holiday, out of the crush, but right on the railway. Small 7/11 in station no alcohol, unfortunately that's all between you and a train ride to a shopping mall. Club rooms good, free wi-fi (cable and wireless). Club staff are good, culturally they must mix your drinks, unlike other club lounges. If you try to pour your own they feel offended, it is not about portion control. However, when the weather is difficult (six months of the year) the pool is closed for days on end because there are 'storm warnings'. No storm? It is for 'safety'. The pool lounges are packed up in 30 degree heat for 'safety'. There is nothing else to do at the hotel especially for teenagers. I eventually won the battle. It took nearly an hour trying to convince the duty manager that it was a hotel policy not a Chinese by-law. That warnings are not storms. Planes are not grounded in 'warnings', the hotel never told us that they just arbitarily close the pool when the weather forcast is for possible storms. They have so many staff at every point, they could do anything. They don't. I went to the concierge at midday, no other customer in the lobby, eight staff -yes eight- staff at concierge desk all willing to say 'no', you have to fight for every request - always poiltely - but everywhere in the hotel, they say 'no', then have to be talked around. Move the umbrella? No, - extra chair at a table in the restaurant? No. There are about 10 well trained staff, and the other 100 seem to be trainees for export to the other Hyatt hotel in Kowloon. And 'No' is the order of the day. A nice little bakery off the lobby, but select from the display, because if you vary your sandwich contents, they call the restaurant kitchen, and you wait, and wait, and 15 minutes later a chef appears resplendent in uniform, full apron and hat, holding a plate with one sandwich on it. It could be so good with just a little bit of management on display. There is not. Asking to see the duty manager takes 20 minutes with to and fro requests for your name, then your room number before he will even speak to you. As a commute hotel it does not matter, as a holiday destination for a week, don't lose your nerve, ask for the duty manager, be prepared to wait, be polite but do not take 'No' for an answer", "Date": "July 27, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "3", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cGreat hotel, just out of the way\u201d", "Author": "WilmslowRoger", "ReviewID": "UR115100419", "Content": "If you know your way around hong kong this is a great value hotel, superb facilities and service at a reasonable pice, but a taxi to central will cost \u00a340, it's closet to the mtr, but a trip to central takes 45 mins, great views from the room I had and a great ( but very quiet) hotel bar.

I had a room on the 5th floor, with a balcony. Not too sure if i can walk out as the door seemed stucked, but one evening, hubby actually found the door opened when we returned. Luckily none of our stuff were missing. Views was zero on the 5th floor. Design was modern, facilities was clean. Bathroom - Love the rainshower. Though the bathtub is by a transparent glass, there is no sound system in the bathroom. Beds - King size was huge, bigger than the typical asia size. Super comfy, sheets were smooth and clean. Entertainment - Not much channels. Simply bad reception. Not much use for the 42 inch TV. But love the magazines provided eg. National geographic, timeout HK , Newsweek etc. Location - about 45 mins from Central, and 20 minutes to Mongkok by MTR. The station is at University MTR, 10 mins away from Shatin station where there is a huge shopping mall, with food. Too bad, the shops at the mall does not open till 11am on a week days, but there are some food joints opened if you don't wanna have brekkie at the hotel. There is a 7-11 located right at the university MTR. My hubby stock up the beer from there. There is also a place offering soups and desserts along the MTR that opens till 11.30 pm in the evenings. Love the herbal tea egg. If you choose room service, it's not too expensive either; i've seen other exhorbitant prices at other Hyatts. Shuttle - There is a shuttle (but the timings are bad, eg. 1300 and the next one at 1900). If you can catch them, you can actually get to the kowloon station (which is also an airport express station) within 30 mins. The same bus runs to Hyatt Regency Tsim Sha Tsui which is a 3 min walk to the Tsim Sha Tsui MTR station. Service - hmm... how should i describe? very discrete, very professional, very efficient but total lack of warmth and smiles. Yeah, you ask something, the response more than often is fast and \"No\" without checking. But if you prompt a little, yeah, they run that extra mile (and No can become Yes easily sometimes). Well controlled expressionless facial language, with little discrete tones between staff (too bad, i don't understand Cantonese) (but somehow i get the feeling they're not too sincere about additional requests). Not a very homely feeling definitely, but i supposed that is the atas feeling the staff wants to potray. Overall, i'll come back to stay (I have no issues about unsmiley staff who wish to act untouchable), mainly for the room space and comfort. It was a 3 day summer sale shopping trip for me, and with the 3 day MTR tourist card which allows unlimited MTR travel, 7-1/2 months preggy tummy, and loads of shopping bags, i still didn't find travelling to and from from town all too bothersome. One side point, if you need internet, get one of those prepaid data SIM cards from HK. I used the one from 3com. Can be easily slid into your Ipad 2 or Iphone 4. Available at 7-11 at HKD198. The max data charge is like HKD28 a day only and you are connected whereever you go.

On my recent stay there over the weekend with a couple of my buddies, we had an overall excellent stay with only a few idiosyncrasies to detract from it being otherwise perfect. The Location: 25 minutes from the Lowu station (Shenzhen Border Crossing) made this a breeze for leaving and re-entering China. The fact that you walk out the front door of the hotel and into the MTR station made it even better. This is a 5 star aspect. The fact that the station you are walking into is University on the east rail line means that you are at one of the only stations in Hong Kong that has no 7-11 or anything else for that matter within a 10 minute drive, except of course, the Hyatt hotel. This is bad for two reasons: In the morning when you don\u2019t want to pay 50 HKD for a coffee and a croissant, or at 1 am when you want a pizza, and the 24 hour room services notes that they stop serving their 200 HKD pizzas at 10pm. This is not a 5 star aspect. The food and facilities: When we arrived after a night of partying in Shenzhen, I had a lunch meeting to attend immediately as we arrived. So we headed to quickly check in, but were unhappy to see a line of 20 people all with the same idea. So no room to change out of my flip-flops and the Tshirt from the night before, but the bellman did direct me to the pool change room. It was perfect. In 5 start Hong Kong style, it was fitted with lockers, showers, toothbrushes a sauna and a hottub. I took a 2 minute shower and helped myself to a toothbrush and comb. I then headed off to the hotel\u2019s restaurant for my lunch meeting. The meeting went well, thanks in great part to the catering\u2026 The hotel weekend buffet was amazing; loads of seafood, western and Chinese dishes, and a mixed grill to die for. They had about as many choices of grilled meats as a Brazilian steakhouse, and a full selection of HK BBQ as well! The salad station featured individually mixed Caesar salads and the dessert station was built around fresh baked Sha Tin apple pies (which you could also purchase boxed to go in the caf\u00e9). Four rounds and I was went away feeling like I got my money\u2019s worth, which at $50+ USD per person was not an easy thing to do. Considering that my glass was always full, and my stomach ended up likewise, this was also a 5 star aspect of our stay. The property: Upon arrival we were delayed to check in, so we chose to eat. When we returned to check in an hour and a half later, we were told the rooms were not ready, this did turn out to be a benefit, as they upgraded us to a 2 bedroom suite that was probably in the vicinity of 1000 square feet, sporting 3 bathrooms, 3 42\u201d or larger TVs a kitchenette, and a 30th floor view of the harbour and surrounding mountains. From looking around from up top, I came to realize that there was absolutely nothing nearby in the form of shopping or eating. We spent the next couple of hours waiting to check in next to the swimming pool, where I considered having a beer until I found out that they charge the price of a 6pack for single can. If only there was a 7-11. The pool was excellent, nice and cool on a 35 degree day. It had been typhoonish only days prior to our arrival, so it was our good fortune that the sky was clear and blue and the sun was burning down on us, melting away the responsibilities that lay in wait for each of us back in Shanghai. 5 star room with a 5 star pool. Cons: As most HK hotels, you have to pay about $20 USD per day for internet. Fortunately we could use connectify to share the signal between all 3 of our computers and cellphones, otherwise this would have been a fortune. The long wait to check in was not really acceptable, but the recompense was highly favourable. Upon checkout, I found out that because I had booked on Agoda, that I received no rewards on my Hyatt Gold Passport, I was disappointed and more than slightly surprised. What\u2019s the point of having the points program if you aren\u2019t going to give them out if people use an agency, or at least let me know when I am booking that you are going to hold out on me! That would be a deal-breaker for me in the future, and a reason to consider another property next time instead of Hyatt, since most other high end hotels give the benefit of finding a deal online, thank you for your patronage by giving you the reward benefits, no matter how you got there. Overall the Hyatt Sha Tin is an excellent resort/business style hotel that is easily accessible, but at least half an hour from anywhere or anything.

If you want to stay outside of the main Hong Kong areas then this is a great location. It's right next to University MTR so access to the rest of Hong Kong is easy. Unfortunately, it's location can also be a hinderance. There are no other restaurants are dining options nearby so taking the MTR to Sha Tin station is the closest. It's also difficult to get there from the airport, unless taking a taxi (approx HK$250) as there are no shuttle bus companies that go to the area. Booking a Club room gives you access to the Club lounge for cooked breakfast to order, evening cocktails and a fantastic view over the harbour. The room rate also includes wireless internet access throughout the hotel, otherwise it is HK$350 for 72Hrs. I'm unsure of the cost for breakfast in the restaurant. Overall, the lounge was nice, however the staff service and attention to details weren't as good as other hotel lounges/clubs. The room itself was very spacious with a very comfortable bed, excellent work desk area and large TV screen. TV channels are the usual ones you get in Asia, with several English channels available covering news, sport and movies.

Got upgraded to a suite and was also glad that we chose the Club package as we had access to the Club lounge - simple but still ample breakfast with choice of 2 hot dishes as well as lots of goodies- tea and coffee all day and the very best was the \"Drinks and canapes \"hours between 5.30pm till 7.30pm. Great service and great atmosphere- perched high above the hotel on the 25th flr overlooking the Tolo harbour. The great service and other wonderful things about teh hotel: 1) Ken, the concierge - who went out of his way to get us two concert tickets for International Jazz Guitarists at the Skylark Club and then fantastic instructions on how to get there - change MTR 3 times and still made it on time to have a drink before the concert. This is one of the many requests and info which he helped us with. 2) Housekeeping - after the first night on quite a hard bed, rang housekeeping who came up immediately to put a beautiful down doona on top of the mattress - had the most heavenly sleep -floating on air. They also put a top sheet upon request. Housekeeping who replenish bottles of water everyday and sometimes twice a day as they noted that we drink fair bit of bottled water. Forgot to turn off the \"Do not disturb\" sign one day and in the afternoon, the room was not made. Saw the housekeeping staff on the floor around 4pm and they came immediately to tidy the room- always smiling, unobtrusive and great service. 3) The friendly shuttle bus driver- the afternoon driver who was a wealth of info about places to eat as we wanted to eat at places where the locals go to ie the best noodles etc 4) the great pool looking onto the mountains - quiet, peaceful and cleaner air than downtown 5) The Restaurant upstairs where we had the Peking duck and other wonderful dishes - reasonable prices - we had the duck( 2 courses) plus 3 other dishes & it was HK 870 for the 3 of us (App Aussie $110). The Hotel's location: Some people were wingeing about the location- the distance to town. If you only have a couple of days in HK and you just want to just shop, then I suggest you stay in town. For us , it was not a problem as we had great fun catching and changing MTR. The Octopus card is a must - get it at the airport. The MTR (5 mins walk from hotel)- one stop south is Sha Tin (5 mins away)- is a huge shopping mall and the next stop is MOng KOk. The other stop north ( from Hotel) is TAI PO - what a great spot - go to the TAI Po markets and then wander around the street stalls ( it is all in a square) - there is a fantastic shop which just sells the best \"custard tarts\". When u get off MTR at Tai Po , turn left and follow the walkway till the end, cross the road and there is a concrete building - downstairs the market and upstairs the food court. If u want to go to the street stalls and market square, then just keep walking left - follow the people. There is also the free hotel shuttle bus which takes u to town to TSim Tchai Tsui ( 30 - 40 mins) and the schedule times are OK (5 times a day)- first bus at 9.30am -this is fine as most shops do not open till 10.30am or 11am. We usually timed our shopping downtown to catch the bus back -the last bus after dinner or buy some dinner - su shi and catch the earlier bus. On a couple of occasions after a big late lunch , having the canapes for 2 hrs was enough for us. If u miss the hotel bus, just catch the MTR. It was always great to come back from hectic downtown to our quiet oasis. Transport was not a problem with the MTR and the shuttle bus- plus taxis are also very reasonable. WE would always choose this hotel when we come back to HK again.

Many people complain about the location and this could be an issue if you plan on spending much time in HK island or Kowloon however if you are planning a trip across the border then this place couldn't be better located. The university MTR station is right outside and takes you direct to the border. In the other direction the famous markets if Mong Kok are only around 10 minutes away with one change at Kowloon Tong station. It will take another change at mong kok to get accross to Central - a total journey time is around 25 minutes. To get here from the airport you can either take a green taxi $250, or the airport shuttle ($100 each) then the same combination of changes. The hotel itself is immaculately clean and very modern. I always select the executive rate available via the Hyatt website as this includes free Internet access, breakfast, and laundry. The cost of these services is expensive by comparison if you pay for them srparately. The breakfast buffet alone is worth it - the quality is amazing. Having stayed in more hotels than I can imagine I have to say that this has one of the best breakfasts out there. My only gripe is that whereas previously they provided freshly made coffee they now provide standard filter coffee only. My only other complaint is the Internet which tends to fluctuate between good and unusable. I had to complain on 3 consecutive days Whig i felt was a let down for the very friendly and helpful staff who did their best but could not fix it. Finally a last word on the location since realistically this is mist likely the only factor to consider.

Maybe if I was one of those people traveling on a Fortune 500 expense account, I wouldn't care. But that's not the case for me. So while I enjoy this (and almost all) Hyatts and in this instance it made good business sense, the invoice when you're checking out is eye-popping! Anyhow, other than that, you won't be dissappointed. The facility is new -- maybe just one year old. It's directly connected to the Shatin bus station and the Shatin train station, so transportation is easy. The lobby is modern and spare. The lobby \"snack bar\" serves a fine breakfast, lunch and dinner, relying on the buffet-style of service but menu options are available. There's a fine business center and a great swimming pool. On the fourth floor there is a bar with live music; they were terrific and my martini was tasty. The chinese restaurant there also provided a better-than-expected hotel dining experience.

The facilities, staff, and rooms at the Hyatt Regency Sha Tin are excellent. I booked a full week and found that after a few days I was getting a little sick of the \"commute\" on the MTR to the downtown sights of Hong Kong. For example, after a day on my feet walking around, on the MTR you can hardly ever get a seat, so the 20-25 minute ride back to the University station next to the Hyatt Sha Tin was a bit grueling after a few days. It's also a little tricky (3-4 changes) to get from the University/East Line to the HK island & Tsim Sha Tsui & Kowloon stops. I often would just take the East Line from University straight to Hung Hom and then just take the nice walk on the harbour to Tsim Sha Tsui etc. But it's a bit out of the way so after coming in for a day to \"freshen up\" I often didn't feel like heading back out for the night into HK. If you don't mind spending on a taxi for the trips back & forth it may be worth it. I know this isn't the fault of the hotel; but next time I would probably stay in a Hyatt a little closer to town.

If you were visiting the University it would be good. One of the other reviews said 15mins on a train to town. Um, were they taking the Concorde? The taxi from the Airport (Friday 6.30pm - got a green \"new territories\" one which is cheaper) cost $260HK and took just over 1/2 hour travelling on average around 100km per hour. When you arrive you will see the university building a tiny 7/11 and 2 student takeaway fast food stores and the hotel - and what you see is what you get. There are no other shops, restaurants, attractions in the local vicinity. If you stay here and you want to see HK (either Kowloon city or the Island), you will need to make the 40minute train trip - changing trains across 4 train lines. We stayed Friday, Saturday and Sunday and travelled at different times including 8am Sunday morning, middle of the day and late evening and we NEVER got a seat on any of the trains because they are always crowded. Not getting a seat isn't such a big deal but it's to illustrate that it's not a leisurely train trip on one line into the city. By the end of the trip you are exhausted and there few places (if any) to sit in public areas (thank goodness for Starbucks) Actually, thank goodness for Starbucks WiFi as well, because the hotel doesn't offer free wifi. When we booked on expedia, the room description said WiFi but, although the hotel offers wifi, you have to pay for EACH DEVICE at a rate of around $25AU per day. This applies in your room and in any other part of the hotel. This is a blatant rip off and you are a totally captive audience because there is not one other available wifi connection point that comes up when you check availability. There is a huge TV in the room but no remote control. Seriously... We rang room service to check if maybe the remote was somewhere we couldn't find it but they confirmed you need to do everything manually Buffet breakfast is $218HK compared with buffet breakfast at the Kowloon Hotel in the middle of Kowloon at $160HK - really it's chalk and cheese. The beds, although made up with lovely linen were extremely hard - not nice hard but to me they felt like layered cardboard. The service was really average. Not terrible and not great. If you are coming to visit HK to see the sites and go shopping this is not the hotel for you. If you are coming to go to the University for some reason this might be an option.

Although the location is out of town, the excellent HK public transport system makes it worthwhile staying at this hotel but do your homework on how the MTR works before you arrive and your experience would be all the better for that. Not advisable to rely on taxis to get to and from the hotel as it is a bit out of the way. University Station on the East Rail overground line is right next door to the hotel (University = The Chinese University of HK). The trains are very quiet so there is no issue with noise. The hotel runs a shuttle bus into Kowloon downtown about 4 times a day. Handy, but probably not frequent enough for some people. Only disappointment about the room was the lack of an armchair. Also, Internet access is very expensive. I was quoted nearly \u00a350 for a week's access!!!!! So in the end I had to make do with paying \u00a37 for an hour's access so that I could check into my flight online. The food was pretty okay but naturally, a bit overpriced comparing to eating out locally (say, take 2 stops on the train to Shatin). Immediately surroundings are very nice with lots of trees and free space i.e. not so built up like downtown. It is possible to take a long walk along the harbour.

As for location, the hotel is away from the main shopping places like Kowloon and Tsim Sha Tsui, it takes about 40 minutes from University station where the hotel is to get to downtown.

My girlfriend came a day earlier (Tuesday) and was shocked when it took her more than 1 hour to get to the hotel from the airport. I told her to take the A41 bus going to Sha Tin's New Town Plaza bus terminal and then take the train ride on the way to Lo Wu's direction and take off at the University station. At first she was furious with the hassle that she went through considering that he luggage was quite big, she even called me up and told me don't be surprsied if it will take me more than 1 hour to reach the hotel. She also told me it's on a different side of Hong Kong compared to Kowloon, TST or Central for that matter. But that's the thing, i chose this hotel for a difrerent experience, away from the city's usual noise and crowded streets, a good place where you can relax, unwind and just chill. And from the photos, I knew this was a perfect place to spend some quality time with my girlfriend. I came in early Wednesday. By 12 noon I was already in the hotel. Man, I have to say, I'm impressed with thye location, the moment i reached the hotel's vicinity, right there I knew this was a \"steal\" and I felt we made the right choice when we booked this hotel in the first place. Hotel Lobby - Perfect Reception People - Perfect Location - Perfect as well! (it's 2-3 mins walk from the University Station MTR) Room - Excellent! (set up was great and the room is quite big) I know if you're new to Hong Kong like it's your first time to visit and when you see some of the reviews about this hotel, you might worry a little but I guarantee you this hotel is \"off the hook\". It's really not that far and it's actually convenient since it's right beside an MTR station, so basically from the hotel you can go anywhere in Hong Kong from this point. There's also a \"Huge\" mall (New Town Plaza) near the hotel (2 MTR stations away only). And the mall is good too. Overall, This hotel is almost PERFECT in my book, the only downside w/c is not really a big deal is the internet. It's not free. Some tips that might help: - From the airport, don't take a cab, the price is not worth it, take the bus A41 which will drop you off at Sha Tin's New Town Plaza ($21 HKD) And take the escalator going inside the mall and then go to the MTR station connected to the mall (Sha Tin Station) then pay $4 HKD for a ticket and take the train going to Lo Wu, 2 stops only, Fo Tan and University where the hotel is located, so it's that easy. - No food stalls, just some small eateries and 711. But the mall is near so it's cool, you can take the MTR and its fast so no worries, they also have restos there like 3 or 4 i think, and they serve good food too. It's Hyatt so you'll never go wrong and quality is at it's BEST. We had a breakfast buffet for $457 HKD for 2 and it's worth it. - From hotel to New Town Plaza, Sha Tin Mall, if you will take a cab, it wil cost you around $60 - $70 HKD. I'll post some pics later. We had a blast staying in Hyatt Sha Tin, very romantic place indeed. 5 stars and 2-Thumbs up for this hotel.", "Date": "October 18, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "HoustonTortuga", "Title": "\u201cVery good hotel, very good value\u201d", "Author": "HoustonTortuga", "ReviewID": "UR81557732", "Content": "It's true that this hotel is pretty far from Hong Kong's big attractions, but I'd stay there again, no question. It felt like a much more expensive hotel than it was. I liked the layout of my room a lot, and the staff was very helpful. I had a great view of Tolo Harbour. The pool was nice. One suggestion I have is to take advantage of the attractions near the hotel. For example, take the ferry that leaves from Ma Liu Shui, which you can walk to, out to Tap Sun and see the fishing villages along the way. The round trip takes about 3 1/2 hours, and you'll feel like you're a hundred miles from the big city. It cost about $7 U.S. total to go out and back. You pay each way. Also, I enjoyed walking through the Chinese University of Hong Kong's campus the mornings I was there. Go at dawn when the bird life is bustling, especially near the ponds, which are near the University MTR station. Breakfast at the student canteen isn't bad at all, and you can buy half the menu for what the breakfast buffet costs at the hotel. I would have spent more money at the hotel if the Internet charge ($20 U.S.) and the buffets ($28 U.S. for breakfast and a good bit higher for lunch and dinner) hadn't been so pricey. The cheapest way I know to get to the hotel from the airport is to take a bus such as Route A41 for $21 H.K., exact amount required, to Sha Tin Center, and switch to the MTR train that goes in the direction of Lo Wu, getting off at the University station. That costs $4 H.K. Get off the train, and if you can't see the Hyatt when you leave the station, go to the other side of the station and you will. It's a short walk to the hotel, and you'll want to enter on the car park level to save walking all the way up the incline to reach the lobby. The bus/train combination will work if you don't have much luggage. I had a hand bag and a rollerboard and did fine. The bus, which has a sizable luggage rack on its lower level, is a straight shot to Sha Tin Center, and after you get off, go up the escalator and ask someone to point you in the direction of the MTR station. If you're on a schedule, leave plenty of time to switch between train and bus, because it can be confusing getting from the bus to the train. It doesn't cost a whole lot to take the Hyatt bus straight from the airport to the hotel, which would be a good idea if you have a heavy suitcase. After my stay at the Hyatt Sha Tin, I spent one night at the SkyCity Marriott on the airport grounds, and it was nice enough but was a bit of a letdown compared to the Hyatt.", "Date": "September 30, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "MerelbekeBelgium", "Title": "\u201cVery modern comfortable hotel, great bathroom, good food,good service,expensive internet.\u201d", "Author": "ForeverTravelfan", "ReviewID": "UR81476765", "Content": "We took a harbour view room.

Hyatt Sha Tin was a great choice. I'd like to begin by saying that the hotel is obviously situated for the convenience of vacation seekers who want to stay at a hotel in the countryside or business people visiting offices nearby such as Tai Po Industrial Estate, Chinese University or Sha Tin. It is obviously not for those who wants to tour around Hong Kong. Statements saying the hotel is too far from the city doesn't do the hotel justice. Also, for the mountain view rooms, be prepared to be disturbed occasionally by the passing East Rail despite the very good sound insulation. I think this is something that should be expected as the hotel is so conveniently located near the University station. That said, I requested early check in for a non-smoking room and received confirmation for 2 p.m. early check in. I attempted check in before 2p.m. and was assigned a room on the 7th floor (non-smoking floor). With two bags of belongings, I was asked to go to the room without any assistance offered to handle the luggage. I tried not to jump to any premature conclusions about the hotel. When I walked into the room, it smelled so bad that I thought it was a smoking room. So I requested a change of the room. None were immediately available and I had to wait until 3p.m. (the usual check in time). I was then assigned to a room on 11th floor. The room was even bigger than the original one but the staff didn't tell me anything about an upgrade which I found very odd as an upgrade would have indicated that they tried to compensate for the trouble they had caused. Anyhow, the room was great, clean and spacious. However, what the staff had forgotten was to install a DVD player at the new room that I had initially requested for my original room. I didn't bother to ask as I did not want to deal with yet another problem. Tried the Cafe for lunch and food can be improved in every department. Quantity was abundant but quality could have been better. The Patisserie (cake shop) was excellent from food to service. The seating area could be a bit bigger. Went for a spa session and the service and quality is very good. The spa suite was very spacious and quite comfortable. Unfortunately, the spa is not connected to the steam and jacuzzi located in the changing rooms by the swimming pool and the gym. The gym is great for a hotel. The equipment is very new and trains all the major muscle groups. The staff were again very friendly and helpful. After closure of the pool for 2 days during the typhoon Chuntha and thunderstorm warnings, finally checked it out on the morning before my departure. The changing room's jacuzzi was broken down for who knows how long and the changing room in general was not of 5 star quality. When I arrived at the swimming pool, I asked for water and was told by the friendly lifeguard that it was only available back in the changing room 1 floor above the pool in a water dispensing machine?!?! The outdoor bar area by the pool was still under ongoing renovation. So I laid down on the sun bed for about 10 minutes and received about 10 mosquito bites. There seemed to be no or seriously lacking mosquito control measures by the pool. The pool area was the most unacceptable part of the hotel. While taking a shower in my room after the dip at around 1:45p.m., I received a call from reception asking when I was going to check out. I was freezing as I was in the middle of a shower and had to answer the call at the toilet. I was left a bit puzzled as I specifically requested 2p.m. check out at the time I checked into the hotel. The receptionist then put me on hold to check availability which made sure I remained freezing. At the end, she confirmed 2p.m. check out was available. So, much trouble was caused to the guest but could have been absolutely avoided. Based on the aforesaid, I think there are pros and cons to this hotel with the former outweighing the latter. I believe the friendly staff has to do a lot with this which leaves me to conclude that the problems I had experienced are at the management level and not how the general staff have poorly executed service of the guests.

The hotel is in Shatin but is near the University, and as such is pretty much in the middle of nowhere and not near any shops bar a little 7-Eleven and fast food place which is near the overground train station. Because of this, first-time visitors/tourists may prefer something closer to town centres but for us the location was perfect as it was quiet (despite being next to the train station! It was inaudible to us when inside), had good transport links with the station and bus terminal next door, and was one stop away from where most of my family live. Also being new and not ideally placed means that their rates are lower than equivalent hotels in more convenient locations. The staff here are really attentive and helpful. No one just stands around chatting, or if they are talking to colleagues they'll leap into action as soon as they see any guests around. As soon as our taxi arrived at the hotel a bellhop came out before it had even come to a stand-still. After checking in we did find that they had omitted a third bed for our room although we had booked a twin room for 3, and also the sliding bathroom door did not slide properly. A quick word with the reception and within 20 minutes both problems were sorted without any fuss whatsoever. Whether you're after a newspaper, an ironing board or random bits of cutlery just ask and it'll be in your room within the next minute; it may even beat you to your room as we found! The room itself wasn't huge but enough for 3 people, and if it was just 2 people occupying it as it was designed then it would be ample space. It was kept really clean apart from some tea stains near the kettle. The beds were comfortable, including the smaller added bed. However the duvets were too warm, especially for the warmer months, and we had to crank the air conditioning right up which is not very green. We didn't really use much in the way of extra services so can't comment. The pool there is a nice size and with the hotel being quite empty when we went, there was no fighting for space whatever the time of day. There is wired and wireless broadband offered for all rooms but this is a complete rip-off as expected - HKD85 for one day or HKD230 for more extended use. You would be better off finding a McDonald's and using the free wi-fi there which is what we chose to do! Overall we really enjoyed our stay at the Hyatt, and given all of its positive points I would definitely stay there again. After staying there I was emailed a questionnaire about how we found our stay. I fed back any issues that we experienced, and within the next 24 hours I was emailed back by a manager thanking me and running through all the points I made, saying they would be passed on to the relevant parties. Nice to know that someone actually reads them all! Some random info for anyone thinking of staying there: To get to shops/restaurants it's only 10-15 minutes to the nearest town centre by train, so the location of the hotel doesn't have to deter. Tai Po Market is one stop away, and Shatin two. Shatin centre is a bit more upmarket and more of a mall, but beware as it gets crazy (think sardines) in the evenings and especially at weekends, public holidays or even if there's sales on in the department store. Tai Po is not especially tailored to tourists and there isn't much English around, but if you don't mind the odd mystery dish there's plenty of culinary gems around.", "Date": "June 7, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "London", "Title": "\u201cExcellent value for money hotel - poor location but not a problem with excellent transport\u201d", "Author": "ramin3", "ReviewID": "UR65249373", "Content": "Stayed in the Hyatt Regency for 1 week.

Within a day, an e-mail was sent to me noting the DVD player and type of bedding requested were confirmed. Upon arrival at the street-level check-in counter, I was adviced that Regency Club room guests have a dedicated counter in the Club Lounge for an exclusive check-in so a very polite member of their staff escorted me up to the 25th floor for just that. By the time we arrived at the Club check-in desk, I was informed that my room is ready, and a brief overview of my stay and requests was given, including the complimentary evening cocktails being served at the lounge (which was ending mid-way during the overlong check-in process). I mentioned my request for late check-out, and the staff frowned and told me I need to request for late check-out ahead of time, which I pointed out I had during booking. He then proceeded to check on his computer, and a few minutes later he seemed to have finally located the information to that request, to which he then told me, \"well, it's a policy that late check-out can only be given when it's available... the hotel is fully booked...(blah).\" In any case, I just asked for my key and I headed to the room, which was located almost as far away from the elevator as possible, and for some strange reason the room has a room within a room which is occupied by a dining table and chairs surrounded by sliding wood panels. I guess I just didn't think this was something I needed for the night, so I called the concierge to see about a room-change. Little did I know that it would be 30 minutes and 3 calls for me to actually get to speak to the concierge - all the while I kept getting the operator saying,'I'll have them call you back right away.\" (which they never did) 45 minutes have passed and a hotel staff comes by and escorts me to a new room. What I thought was a very nice gesture to make up for the long check-in (and the poser attitude from the check-in staff), and amenities I didn't care for, turned out to be a bigger room with unflushed toilets and water leaks that nearly earned me a trip to the hospital. There is a separate bathroom in the living room, and as I put down my bags and said goodbye to the hotel staff [who escorted me to the upgraded one-bedroom], I walked around the new room and thought this was a really nice place. I began to unpack and tried to get my laptop connected to check e-mail. Had a little trouble getting the broadband connection - there was no instructions to be found in the desk drawers. In any case, this was resolved after 10 minutes or so. I got up and walked out to the living room and as I headed toward the \"guest\" bathroom, my legs went up into the air and my back landed on my luggage, which I had left behind me. As I put my hands down to lift my body up, I realized I had slipped on a puddle of water. I looked up and there went a trickle right down onto my face - the leak was from above. I grabbed a towel that was hanging in the bathroom and put it over the puddle, and threw some tissue on-top to soak up the water. Having no bin to throw the tissue away, I lifted the lid to the toilet [thinking to dispose the tissue] and realized that whoever used it before did not flush, and there were \"remains\" left behind from the previous patron. Furious at all that has happened in the past hour, to which I felt like I was paying to do work for the hotel, I called \"guest services\" again. They assured me someone would come right away... Another 15 minutes went by, the phone rang and the operator told me I need to open the door so the repairmen could come in. I asked why they didn't just knock at the door, to which I was told coldly that I had the \"do not disturb\" sign on. I have never heard of that kind of strict courtesy -- so does that mean if a fire broke out, they would still respect my privacy?! 15 minutes after the repairmen entered, they managed to fix the leak. Before they left, they told me House Keeping would be coming to clean up -- as of check-out the next day, no one ever called or came by. I guess my luck just ran out that day at the Hyatt Shatin, but I wouldn't expect that level of service, or lackthereof, even with a Motel 6 -- adding more insult to injury, when I informed the lady during check-out, she responded by saying, \"is there anything I could do for you right now?\" I decided it was just a waste of my time to even comment - I never expected to pay my way so I can be treated as a custodian by the Hyatt group.", "Date": "December 27, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "New York", "Title": "\u201cStunning!\u201d", "Author": "nerdyprof", "ReviewID": "UR51490264", "Content": "I loved this hotel.

First, it is absurdly difficult to get to the hotel on foot, and for that reason alone I would never recommend it. (Nor does the hotel do very much in the way of posting signs for the benefit of pedestrians or travelers coming from the nearby MTR station.) When you do finally make your way there, you find that you're entering the building along the access lanes for the parking garage. That's hardly a grand entrance. The whole message is \"Anyone worthwhile will surely be arriving by car or taxi; people who want to walk in off the street must be vagabonds.\" Next, I never could figure out the air conditioning controls in my room, and suspect that the whole system was faulty. The default temperature setting is 20 degrees Celsius, but the room was never that cold. I had to bring it down to 19.5 or 19--and even then it didn't seem to work properly, in that the fan would go for hours and hours without cooling the room significantly, and then suddenly and unpredictably start blasting air so frigid that you'd have to run to the thermostat and raise the temperature again. Not very comfortable. The room design is intelligent; you get a nice bed, wired internet access (150 RMB for 24 hours), and a spacious bathroom with separate bath and shower. My soap dish had a layer or two of soap scum that the chambermaid never managed to clean, and initially I was missing my bathroom scale.

The hotel is a new hotel that was recently opened in February. It is so new that they have yet to have their grand opening. The gentleman who showed us to our room told us that they will have their grand opening at the end of April. They are still doing some finishing touches on the pool and in one of the restaurants. The staff is very happy to assist you whatever you wish. Everyone we've spoken to speaks good English, so communication isn't a problem if English your primary language. The hotel itself is brand spanking new. Everything looks polished and smells new. We stayed in a room with 1 queen bed and had more than enough room for 2 average sized suit cases. Our room had a nice sized tv, a small sofa, lounging chair. I don't know about the double rooms, but in our room, there's a window that separates the bathroom and sleeping area. You can clearly see inside the bathroom from the bed. The bathroom itself is very nice looking. There is both a shower and a tub. The hotel is located about 30 minutes from the airport and just a few seconds from the University Station train station. The buffet breakfast in the main dining area is very good, but rather expensive. Expect to pay $450 HKD for two people.", "Date": "April 16, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Seoul", "Title": "\u201cA place to stay\u201d", "Author": "disalvo72", "ReviewID": "UR27968564", "Content": "Recently open if you looking for a great place to stay not so far from all the major place in town with very good travel commodities, the MTR is just a 5 minutes walking distance and you can rich the center in 20-25 minutes.

Pleasantly surprised to find a very new & stylish Hyatt with friendly but appropriately formal service. Bill came to $180 US for one night plus a breakfast charge, which seemed reasonable. Booked a standard room, but wonder if it was a Jr. Suite as it was quite large. It was very clean & had modern decor. Nice gym with new equipment (incluing new loaner shoes I borrowed). As it's brand new (trip was March 2009), they were still getting some kinks out (like fuzzy TV reception, possibly too-hot sauna, pool not yet in use, not all restaurants open, construction still going on next door, guest room doors slam hard, etc.) However, I'd still stay there again. Location is not ideal to see Hong Kong proper, but the Train stop is right near the hotel, and we went into Hong Kong one afternoon/evening very easliy.", "Date": "March 31, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "3", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "canada", "Title": "\u201cbrand new\u201d", "Author": "restleswanderer", "ReviewID": "UR27064636", "Content": "great hotel within reasonable distance of airport. rooms were fabulous and service excellent.
