The breakfast was the worst in my HI experience; the eggs were tasteless and a very odd consistency like little pebbles, no bacon or sausage like most HI breakfasts have. The location is really pretty and close to some nice shopping, as well as really convenient right off the interstate.

We wanted to stay close to the field. Anthem is a suburb about 15 to 20 minutes north of Phoenix. The big landmark there is an outlet mall that could use a lot more business, frankly. The Hampton Inn in Anthem offered a great rate and received high ratings from other travelers so I booked. When we arrived, it was past midnight. I guess Hampton cancels reservations for guests who don't arrive by midnight. They had just cancelled us but promptly gave us a room when we arrived. Unfortunately, the desk manager didn't look at the rate I was supposed to get ($9 per night lower than he put in for us)...but that got straightened out at check-out and Hampton honored the lower rate no problem. The hotel is very clean and well kept. The rooms are spacious and quiet. I am very picky about bed firmness and the bed was pretty good. Linens were in good shape. Towels were still nice and thick. The bathrooms are kind of tight...not much space in there. But the tub was clean and they launder their shower curtains. Counter tops were in good shape and they provided us with ample towels. Complimentary breakfast was nice...they offer a good selection but if you like bacon or sausage with your eggs, you'll want to go to the Denny's across the parking lot. The hotel features a hot breakfast (eggs & potatoes or biscuits & gravy), oatmeal, dry cereal, pastries, fresh fruit, and waffles (that you make yourself). There were enough spaces to sit and there is a sitting room in the lobby too. I used the business center and that was in good shape too, enough to print out boarding passes in a hurry. There is a pool outside. My husband watched the hotel maintenance man clean the pool from our room window and was impressed with how hard that man worked. He really put in a lot of physical effort to clean that pool, not just a quick, get-it-over-with task. We are impressed with how conscientious people are doing their jobs. Everyone at this hotel seemed to really be invested in their jobs and it shows in how well run the hotel is. The best service story here was what happened on our last night of our 3 night stay. The guests in the room next to us decided to burn incense in their room. The odor was awful and made me physically ill. I called the front desk around 10PM. They contacted the guest in that room to ask them to stop burning the incense but they obviously did not stop because the odor became stronger. I called a second time and the manager agreed to move us to a room on the other wing. She came and brought keys and we were moved. No hassle or push-back. The manager was very apologetic about the situation. I was glad I asked to be moved because I heard the incense problem affected other guests too and I wasn't sure if all the guests were able to move to other rooms like I did. Anyway, this Hampton Inn was pretty good and the staff were very attentive and friendly. Assuming my son's baseball team goes back to Anthem next year, I will definitely stay here again.", "Date": "February 5, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Evansville, IN", "Title": "\u201cWonderful In Every Way\u201d", "Author": "knightrider98", "ReviewID": "UR123853362", "Content": "We were in need of a hotel room at the last minute, late at night.

What a pleasant surprise for a \"road side\" type hotel. The front desk was professional and so nice. Check in a breeze. The room was so clean and modern and very roomy. They launder everything in the room after each customer. The breakfast room was sunny and you could sit outside if you wanted to. I am so picky, so if I tell you it is a nice place to stay, it really is.", "Date": "January 4, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Bristol,England", "Title": "\u201cBrilliant value\u201d", "Author": "eclass", "ReviewID": "UR18910213", "Content": "Little to add to what others have said. Just about a perfect experience. We stayed twice and on each occasion the room and staff were beyond criticism.

Better and cheaper than anything you are likely to find near the airport.", "Date": "August 13, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Michigan", "Title": "\u201cKudos to the staff\u201d", "Author": "SCBMichigan", "ReviewID": "UR18209763", "Content": "I have nothing but praise for this property and the wonderful people that work there. Our room was lovely, great bed, very clean bathroom. We booked a one night stay before flying home the next day. My husband became very ill during the night; we ended up having to cancel our plane reservations as he was too ill to travel. Not only did management extend our stay for us, they did it for two more nights as my hubby ended up in the ER. When we came back to the hotel at 3 AM, the staff opened the kitchen and fixed me a bagel when I mentioned I was starving. All this and a NASCAR race pending to boot - they were completely booked up. They bent over backwards for us. Kudos to them all! This is long overdue. I also must praise the guys at Daisy Mountain Fire and Rescue. One of them drove my rental car to the hospital so I could ride in the ambulance with my husband. Then they hung around the hospital talking to me, keeping me company while my husband was examined then they gave me their cell phone numbers in case I needed anything. They even showed up hours later to check on us. What great guys! The Anthem area is blessed to have them looking out for them! Will MOST DEFINITELY stay here the next time we come to Phoenix.", "Date": "July 24, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "pennsylvania", "Title": "\u201cLoved this stopover\u201d", "Author": "nadine2885", "ReviewID": "UR16975973", "Content": "This Hampton Inn was a terrific stay for an excellent price.
