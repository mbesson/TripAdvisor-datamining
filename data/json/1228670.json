In a city with beautifully-kept plazas, this square, Pla del Palau, has people who hang around for no discernible reason, the storefronts next to the hotel have graffiti on them, and the stepdown area directly in front of the hotel could use a cleaning. On the other hand, once you walk in the hotel, the interior more than makes up for its outer appearance. It feels clean and modern inside. The hotel has a bit of a nautical theme seeing as it is somewhat close to the water, with maritime objects in window cases, white marble staircase leading to upper floors, nautical charts on the walls, and an indoor terraza/sitting area with inner windows overlooking it. There is a TV/computer room on the first (not lobby) floor that is a good place to hang out if you don't want to be in your room. There are small balconies outside of many of the rooms that offer somewhat of a view. The hotel is well located: a ten minute walk to the marina, a bit further to La Rambla, the Barri Gotic, Olympic village towers (not the area where the actual Olympics were held, that is further away, on Montjuic). A naval college is across the street. Several buses stop in front of the hotel, and the Metro (Barceloneta station) is half a block away. We were not impressed with the day staff at the front desk; they were somewhat short with us, although the younger man who wears the short, blue jacket was very helpful. On the other hand, the gentleman who works at the desk overnight was VERY helpful, friendly and, in fact, rode and chatted with us on the Metro to Urquinaona on our last morning there, then got off the train with us and pointed the way towards our destination at Catalunya.

As far as the location is concerned, it can't be better. The hotel is located right between Port Vell and the Gothic Quarter. It is also very well served by buses, though the nearest metro station is about 15 minutes away. On the negative side I should mention the lack of Internet access in the room. I thought it's a pretty standard feature nowadays for most of the hotels located in tourist cities.

We wanted a hotel that would be easy to get to from the cruise terminal after our 31 day Mediterranean cruise. It\u2019s always a good idea to stay overnight at your final destination before catching your flight home. The reason we did it was because it takes time to disembark from the cruise ship and we had to be at the airport 3 hours ahead of time. From the port to the main entrance of town is a long wait. Although the cruise lines offer a shuttle at a minimal price, the wait can be over an hour. That applies to taxis also. You are not allowed to walk from the port in Barcelona, besides which it would be a very long walk (though it doesn\u2019t look like it on the map). I searched for a hotel at a reasonable price that would be close to the cruise terminal because no matter what, we would have to take a taxi to the airport and there are very few hotels that offer shuttle service. Las Ramblas is a major tourist attraction and is the central drop off point for the shuttle buses. The statue of Christopher Columbus rests at the foot of Las Ramblas which is the first attraction you see. Our hotel was an eight minute walk down the straight and smooth Passeig de Colon walkway. It is a safe and interesting walk. It\u2019s hard to get lost as long as you continue in a straight line that connects to d\u2019Isabel 11. Make a right turn on Pla del Palau and the hotel is just ahead on the right. You will see the Nautical building across the street. It is across from a little park and a very short walk to the best tapas bar in Barcelona, El Vaso de Oro, in Ciutat Vella/Balboa 6, 08003. El Vaso de Oro has all great reviews and lives up to them. We arrived in Barcelona on a Sunday so we had to wait till four until they opened. The rest of the week, they may be open for lunch as well, but I am not sure of the times. Although to stroll along the beautiful Passeig de Joan de Bordo along the marina with all the tempting outdoor restaurants to sway you, you will never forget this little tasty tapas bar tucked away in an alley just a few steps from the main drag. I chose the Hotel del Mar for several reasons; the reviews were good, the location was perfect for us (close to the cruise terminal), it was inexpensive, and it was very close to El Vaso de Oro. This was our last destination, and I wanted our food experience to be memorable. Though we had the most wonderful food on our cruise ship, The Nieuw Amsterdam, I\u2019ll never forget the foie gras at El Vaso de Oro. The hotel was clean, the service helpful and our room though we never asked for anything special, room had a huge terrace overlooking the whole area. They provided chairs, chaise lounges and an umbrella for us to end our day with a relaxing atmosphere. It was quiet and peaceful, a perfect place to end our long journey. If we were going to remain for another day, we could have hopped on the city bus that stops right out front and went on some sightseeing adventures, but we just wanted a day to relax before our long trip back to Arizona. I took some pictures of our terrace and view. Thanks for reading this and I hope wherever you end up in Barcelona, your experience will be as good as ours.", "Date": "October 12, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Amsterdam, The Netherlands", "Title": "\u201cDescent hotel at a good location\u201d", "Author": "Margaritha83", "ReviewID": "UR118570125", "Content": "Had a pleasant stay here.

The breakfast was quite good with enough variety to suit the palate [cereal, fruit, bread of various types, cheese, sausages, eggs, tea, coffee, juice etc].

So I go downstairs with the other guests using stairwell.

How do you know that it WILL go off when you want it too? I'm all for saving money on hotels during vacation. But it concerns me alot that the hotel has a mal-functioning fire alarm system.

They were right! We had one of those trips where I kept getting a primo room. I wish I could tell you the secret. Maybe it was booking early. Maybe it was not quibbling over price. Maybe it was checking-in around noon. And finally, maybe it was because I walked in there with my Tripadvisor cap on! Hey, it couldn't hurt. Everything the readers have been saying about location is true. The hotel is well placed for the Gothic quarter, the Ramblas, the Metro, the Bus Touristique and the port area. The hotel is well organized, clean and safe. A good value for Barcelona. The real surprise was the terrace as I was not prepared for how spacious and private it was. When we were there the weather was hot and the terrace was like an oven during the day. We couldn't help ourselves and washed some clothes in the bath and aired them out. In the morning and evening we could sit very comfortably outside in our own private paradise. Wonderfull! Another tip (which I am sure the Hotel would not want me to give out) is that in hot weather get two keys. Take one on your adventuring and use the other to keep the electricity in the room activated so that the room is tolerable when you come back. Here are some petty negatives. I couldn't find a good patisserie nearby to pick-up a light breakfast to eat out on the terrace. We looked at the Hotel breakfast (9 euros) but it was not that appealing. Periodically a foul odour would emanate from the bathroom (not me!) but it would disappear just as fast. Despite this, I would go back here in a heartbeat. For a dining tip, I suggest the plaza opposite the nearby Santa Maria del Mar church (a grand gothic). A place called Bubo has a meagre 4 tables out in the courtyard. We found that they take the pain out of ordering Tapas by having a neat prix fixe, but I would still order a la carte. It was cheap but tasty and made to order.
