When I changed the hotel provided linens, a huge moth flew out from under the fitted sheet. It was so big I found myself ducking so that it did not hit me. A family of many stayed above us. The children running coupled with the floors and ceilings allowing every sound to be heard, kept us awake until well after 2 in the morning. In addition, when they sat on their balcony, they smoked cigarrettes and drank I do not know what, which all ended up on my clothes that were drying on the balcony chairs. The air conditioner did not work effectively, caused us to sweat thru most of the day and well into the night.

Here is what happened. My brother and I, he is 27, I am 22, both males, made reservations with the Sea Scape back in June to stay there in mid August. We made the reservations for an Ocean Front room with a balcony, and the motel associate was able to accommodate our request. The only thing we were asked on the phone is, \"Are you two adults?\", and I responded that yes we were. We paid our deposit, got our confirmation, we were all set. Well, upon arrival, the very nasty motel manager, who immediately took a negative attitude with my brother and I as soon as we set foot in the lobby, sneered at us that we were not allowed to have an Ocean Front room, that the Sea Scape does not rent balconies to \"singles\". I explained to the man that I was never asked on the phone whether or not we were two single people, and he showed me our reservation card - someone had marked \"male/female couple\" on our card. Yet I was never asked that on the phone. Clearly, I would not lie on the phone, and then drive nearly 7 hours to Ocean City to try to break the rules and get into our motel. Had we been asked if we were two single people, we would have said yes, and made reservations elsewhere. But rather than trying to be understanding, the motel manager yelled at us, and told us that we were kids and we would be having parties on our balcony, throwing beer bottles, and inviting girls up off the board for a party. He judged us based on our young appearance, and called us both trouble makers and liars in front of other motel workers and guests. This was truly an embarrassing and appalling situation. He insisted that whoever took our reservation on the phone asked us if we were a couple, and implied that we lied when we made our reservation. He threw a key at us which was for a first floor, side view room, and told us to go look at it. We could have that room if we wanted, but not the room with the balcony that we reserved some two months ago. We obliged and looked at the room - it was small, dirty, in a horrible location, and we wanted nothing to do with it. After returning to the office and having to listen to this old shyster accuse us of lying and planning to have parties and destroy his motel room, my brother and I left and found reservations elsewhere, an Ocean Front balcony room at the lovely Sahara Motel (the same kind of room we were denied access to at the Sea Scape). The workers there were more than kind, and they too were appalled at how we were treated at the Sea Scape. I knew the Sea Scape was less than appealing looking on the outside, but who knew that we would find the staff to be just as despicable as the rooms. My family and I have been coming to Ocean City, MD since I was born, and we have never had anything less than exceptional stays on the boardwalk. Never in my life have I been treated so poorly, and embarrassed so much in front of other people. To be chided for something you have done is one thing - to be called liars and accused of doing something before we even do it is another thing entirely. We will be contacting the Ocean City Chamber of Commerce to let them know what a black mark this experience has made on their resort, and how poorly the manager of the Sea Scape has represented Ocean City. Simply because my brother and I were young, we were immediately discriminated against, called liars, and denied the reservations that we made months in advance. What's more, it was done in such a demeaning and embarrassing way. I wish the experience we had in that motel lobby on no one. So in closing, I plead that everyone hear this story and take your business elsewhere! I will be doing everything I can to dissuade anyone from staying at this wretched place, and giving this bitter and bigoted old man any money whatsoever.", "Date": "August 11, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "1.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "baltimore", "Title": "\u201cMites all over the place lawsuit is coming\u201d", "Author": "angelslildevilxx", "ReviewID": "UR8366925", "Content": "That place is horrible we stayed in room 108 and it always felt moist in the room there was some kindof mold growing under the sink.
