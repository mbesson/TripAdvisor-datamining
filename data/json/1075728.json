First of all, the room was very hot and smelled of urine. The heat did not help the odor situation and there was no air conditioning (this was ok since they didn't advertise that they had A/C). I was traveling with a friend and we had made the reservation for two and requested two beds. When we got there, there was one bed and they refused to do anything about it, stating that we should have let them know earlier. There was no possible way to do so, since when we checked in, they still hadn't cleaned the room so we had to store the luggage at the front desk and then went out for the day. To discover this when we returned at 11pm was a major disappointment. The kicker though was that AFTER using the toilet, we discovered that it did not flush. When reporting this to the front desk, the employee said \"well now I have a problem because there are no other rooms and nobody is here to fix it.\" Uh, no pal, it's not your problem, it's OUR problem since we now have a toilet full of bodily functions and no other place to go. Same guy who refused to fix the bed situation, even though the bed in there was two double beds shoved together and he could have at least just given us a spare set of blankets/sheets so we could do it ourselves. To add insult to injury, the free wi-fi in the hotel lobby only worked with one computer at a time, so that if you were online and someone else signed on, you were kicked off. Great...

It was the worst hotel experience I have ever had. Upon first arriving, we discovered there is no elevator in the hotel (and no porter) so if you're planning to stay here (which I implore you not to) be prepared to haul your luggage up narrow staircases. The room we stayed in (51--on the fifth floor) was very tiny and main window is actually a door to a roof top balcony. However, it is shared with the room next door so there's not much privacy. The walls are paper thin - that was the only time being on the fifth floor benefited us, we only had one neighbor. The first and last night we were at the hotel we had very noisy neighbors who kept us up past 2am. Not the hotels fault, but if the rooms were better soundproofed it wouldn't have been such a bother. The bathroom was large, but the shower was very small and took 5+ minutes to get hot water. One of the worst parts of the room was the bed. The comforter felt wet/greasy and smelled like cheap men's cologne--like instead of washing it they just sprayed something on it. The bed was tiny and the pillows were uncomfortable chunks of foam. And worst of all, our second to last night there, my husband broke out in hives all over his body. Most likely from the bed. Also, the rooms (or at least the one we were in) required the key to lock from the inside, I found this odd and a potential fire hazard. The hotel provides free breakfast in the basement. Not much there but it's free - instant coffee, croissants, and cereal (something similar to Coco Puffs and Corn Flakes). Don't drink the orange juice - it's brown. The one positive thing about the hotel was that most of the staff were nice or at least polite. The manager, whom we spoke with twice, was very pleasant. The street noise was very minimal due to the \"tucked away\" location of the hotel--but with all the noise inside the hotel it didn't matter.

Room 310 was clean & pleasant with some nice roof beams to stare at but that's the only pros. The cons were that the room had no window as such, just a barred rooflight you could not reach to see out of or close on a night (midges). The air con system didn't work & the shower enclosure was so small that you had to be an 8 stone weakling to get into it. The wash hand basin plug didn't plug & when you switched the light on in the ensuite the extract fan sounded like Concorde taking off. Breakfast was italian style pastries with drinks out of vending machines (adequate at best). I was glad to spent only a minimal amount of time in the room & when I expressed my dissatisfaction to the staff, i was told they had nobody to deal with the problems. You certainly got what it said on the tin - low quality for low price package from Thomas Cook. Rome itself was magnificent once you saw past the grafitti, beggars & tourist traps. Try to see all the sights late at night because most of them look their best when lit up & also the main tourist hordes will be safely tucked up in their hotels. The hop on hop off open top buses that operate around the city are well worth the money not only to locate & view the sights but to save you time & to relieve your very tired legs.

Our taxi driver took us straight there, we arrived late at night and the first thing we noticed was a typical Italian bar about three doors down where people were sitting outside enjoying a glass of wine (how perfect!) We were greeted on reception by an english speaking man (the grumpy one??) who was both polite and helpful. Apart from the fact that he gave us a room (52) on the top floor. That's 5 flites of narrow stairs and no lift!! The room itself was small and basic in furnishings but thankfully had aircon (it was 100deg during our stay!!)
