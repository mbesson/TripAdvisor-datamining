I got a job unexpectedly in Seattle, and my family and I needed a place to stay while I started work, we looked for an apartment, and we learned our way around a new city. The Georgetown Inn was the hotel that was closest to my work and was the most affordable place with a kitchenette, so we took a shot. Man are we happy we did. The staff was top notch. Every one that worked there was extremely friendly, accommodating, and considerate. One of our first nights there, we spent about 20 minutes talking with Richard and Tony, and they gave us a wonderful overview of the neighborhood, restaurants, and places to go with our three year old. They pointed us to the park across the street where our son loved playing; to Via Tribunali (amazing pizza); and to other restaurants, shops, and places of interest. It was great. Plus, we loved that Richard knew local business owners by name. The fact that he was so invested in the neighborhood was truly attractive to us, and made our stay so much more fun. Compared to the hotels where we stayed on our drive out (\"Um, there's an Arby's by the interstate\") we were so happy and felt that we got to know a wonderful neighborhood that we've already gone back to a couple times just to hang out. The facility itself is nice. We don't stay in hotels much, so we don't have much in the way of expectations, but the Georgetown Inn was great. It was super clean, well decorated, and in a constant state of updates. During the two weeks we were there, there were minor (but not all all inconvenient) updates to the lobby which we thought looked pretty good to begin with. Also, furniture from various rooms was being updated, and it looked like beds were being changed out as well. Also, there were more amenities than we could have asked for: free laundry, sauna, exercise room, continental breakfast (Costco Muffins, bagels, toast, cereal, juice--way more than our usual bowl of cereal at home, so we were quite happy). Also, they had great coffee in the lobby 24 hours a day. The cherry on the cake of our visit was this: A few days into our stay, and after talking with Richard and Tony, I got a call at work. We were offered the opportunity to move to the suite (at no additional cost) because Richard felt that it would be easier for my family and I since we were there for such a long time. It's the first time we've been offered an upgrade of any kind, and it was so worth the wait. The suite we moved to was great for us: it had a great kitchen, a large bath, and separate bedroom so I could work in the room after our son went to bed. We can't recommend the Georgetown highly enough. We needed a clean, safe, functional hotel, and we got all that as well as a wonderful staff and an introduction to a wonderful neighborhood that is supporting local artisans/businesses.

The bathroom was immaculate and the towels fresh as well. During my stay of 5 days the maid service was excellent and the front desk staff was polite, friendly and helpful. The free breakfast was satisfactory with a good variety of foods to choose from. The coffee was very good, and certainly kept fresh and plentiful. The only concerns were the sound level from the airline traffic above and the firmness of the bed. The Inn is on the final flight approach to both Boeing Field and SeaTac Airport, so the sound of jet and airplane traffic was constant. I was on the upper 3rd floor so I was closest to the sound as well. The windows were insulated enough that I didn't find the noise levels too bothersome. I would think the first or second floors would be much quieter. The matress was extremely firm, almost board like. The pillows were soft, but fluffy. I prefer a firm bed so it wasn't too uncomfortable for me. I recommend taking your own pillows with you if you can. The Inn provides a large flat screen TV, so viewing is very pleasent. Wi-Fi is available in most rooms. My room had a poor Wi-Fi connection, so the Inn provided a long network cable with a direct internet connection for free. The network speeds were at all times excellent. Easy access to the VA Hospital only 10 minutes away, or $8.00 by taxi.

The Pros: lovely friendly helpful staff; clean clean rooms; decent complimentry breakfast; free coffee 24/7; free parking; 3 asian restaurants, 1 hamburger joint, one organic soup/salad cafe and a Starbucks just across the road; gas station across the road has little mini mart (and two great hot meal lunch specials every day); great shower pressure and plenty of hot water; free shuttle to VA and airport if needed; free laundry facilities; wifi worked great; small but sufficient gym and rooms were not too noisy once the air con was on; plus I could take a breakfast tray up to my husband every day. Cons: no coffee maker in the rooms; the bed was a little too hard for my liking. Now to address some of what the other reviews said. If you are there because of the VA, if your spouse/partner is just along for the drive then you WILL have to pay for them. I was there because my husband was not allowed to drive after the surgery. We did not see any hookers, but then we did not go out after dark. There were some homeless people around but I was never bothered walking to or from the gas station or restaurants. The staff are honest and conscientious and were super-dupa friendly no matter whether I wanted a bowl, extra sugar, more towels etc. No visitors after certain hours and they had to check in? Makes sense to me. The hotel is in an industrial area and there were some homeless people around. I can honestly say that if it were not for the dire circumstances we were there and if the beds were a little softer, it would have been a great stay. We will definitely stay there again, I will just bring a matress topper.", "Date": "September 11, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Sleep Quality": "1", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Moscow, Idaho", "Title": "\u201cHORRIBLE MOTEL--DO NOT STAY HERE!!!!

I had NO choice but to stay as this location, or I would have NEVER stayed here. During check-in, I was told that my wife MUST come in (at the same time which meant our kids must come in too) and show her ID so that THEY COULD MAKE SURE SHE WASN'T ON THEIR LIST OF KNOWN HOOKERS!!!!! I asked to speak to a manager and was given a phone number that was disconnected. After check in we immediately received a call from the front desk that because the VA only had us staying one night that we must be out asap in the morning because \"they like to clean early\". I informed them that the VA was paying for 2 nights and that we would NOT be checking out in the morning. They then told us that their paperwork did not show a 2 night stay and that we were to check out and that if the VA DID authorize another night we could check back in at 4pm the next day. The VA called them and told them that \"yes they did authorize 2 nights and that the paperwork that they sent confirmed this\" but the motel is making us check out anyways and requiring us to bring back a NOTORIZED copy of the authorization from the VA. AFTER THE VA CALLED AN CONFIRMED THEIR AUTHORIZATION and FAXED them another copy of the original paperwork. They said \"You are just having a friend call and act like the VA\". I cannot believe the unprofessionalism and outright rudeness of the staff at this motel and would NOT EVER recommend anyone staying here. The website for this motel also states that there is a fitness center on site, but the staff only allows STAFF to use the fitness center. Also, there are only enough free parking spots for 1/4 of the number of rooms they have, THOUGH the website clearly states that they have AMPLE free parking for ALL rooms.", "Date": "June 4, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "2", "Sleep Quality": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Toronto, Ontario Canada", "Title": "\u201cNot a hotel, more a motel\u201d", "Author": "HPMC", "ReviewID": "UR56802360", "Content": "I'm all for staying at a place that fits my budget and try to keep costs down for my company but this was ridiculous.

He took my credit card and ID and didn't explain that he was just taking an imprint for security... so the next morning when I checked out, the girl asked for my card again and I argued with her until she finally explaned.

No hairdryer (for fear of stealing I suppose).
