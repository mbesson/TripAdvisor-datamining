But most of all, the Grachtengordel (Canal ring) region turned out to be the best place to stay in Amsterdam if one wants to get the most of the city\u00c2\u00b4s unique character and architecture. It is a very nice neighborhood, with lots of caf\u00c3\u00a9s, shops, restaurants, and small streets to hang around, but also a place where people live, go ice skating h in the canals during the winter, children play, and wherever you look around, you know you are in Amsterdam, surrounded by those lovely and typical canal houses. In spite of the very cold whether, we still managed to go almost everywhere in the city on foot. Beware only of the very sharp staircase, which is, by the way another common characteristic of the canal houses.

The hotel is incredibly convenient and quite authentic. If you mind climbing stairs, don't look at this place. The staff will happily carry your luggage up and down, so that is not a consideration. Very clean and a wonderful family-run hotel. Tasty and plentiful breakfast. Close to the Jordaan where there are an unbelievable number of fantastic restaurants for every taste, as well as small bars and pubs. Not a bad walk from the Central Station, but close to a tram line. Take the money you save by staying here and have a wonderful meal in the Jordaan. Or two. You won't regret it! There is a pub just a few steps from the front door which is an authentic Brown Cafe, as well as a great restaurant and a hand-made pizza take-out where the locals line up.

THE GOOD: Location - Close enough to the action (10-15 minute walk to the Royal Palace / Dam Square) but far enough out to be relatively quiet. Rooms - Nice rooms overall, somewhat small (even compared to our hotels in Bruges, Brussels and Boullion, and especially compared to North American Hotels), but clean and reasonably appointed. Our rear-view room had a nice view of a courtyard/garden of a few neighboring buildings. Bed was a queen size and quite comfortable. The bathroom (at least in our \"garden view\" room) looked recently updated, but had a shower setup that seemed to encourage spraying water all over the place (hand-shower, no shower-curtain). As a Canadian I'm not sure if this is standard, or odd for European accommodations, although I didn't see it again on our trip through Belgium. Breakfast - Good choice of fruits, breads, cheese, some meat, yogurt, cereals. No warm options (other than toast I suppose) but that's expected. Service - Very warm and helpful staff (owners?). Only \"problem\" I could see coming up (and it happened to a couple other visitors during our stay) is that they lock the \"day door\" at odd times, I guess when they need to leave the front desk, leaving you unable to access your room if you don't have a key for the night door (ex - run out for a minute and leave the key with someone in your room). WiFi - Quick, free wifi connection. THE BAD: Staircase - Not really a negative, but something you need to be aware of - stairs are VERY steep and narrow. They do however have a power-lift chair, but I have no idea of the speed/hassle of using it if you need to. The Safe : Kind of a silly thing for some people, but the complimentary \"safe\" in the room (a small digital-locking one with simple instructions) is only secured with 2 small screws to a particle-board shelf in the wardrobe. I'd recommend NOT using the safe, as it's an obvious target and would be very easy for any thief to remove from it's location and break open off-site. Most chain hotels secure their safes with large lag screw through concrete walls, or at least directly into wall studs. Power outlets : Another minor issue - only 1 \"open\" power outlet in our room, (or None if you have the fan plugged in) making it inconvenient to plug in laptop charger, etc where I'd like it. Glad I brought a small North American power bar instead of multiple converters.", "Date": "May 25, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Dublin, Ireland", "Title": "\u201cGreat Canal House experience\u201d", "Author": "Neidin_Ban", "ReviewID": "UR107634784", "Content": "We stayed at 't Hotel for 3 nights in mid-April.

I am a planner by trade, so of course, I did A LOT of research for this trip - our first to Europe. I did even more research when it came to the hotel. I wanted something authentic (i.e. no chain hotel). We had a fairly decent budget and I was determined to stay in something nice. Cleanliness was very important, as was the bathroom. We could not have been happier with this property. Not only is it in the Jordaan District, it is also on one of the nicest canals in the city. Location, location, location. I had no idea how important that would be on our trip - but this hotel was in the PERFECT location. I contacted the hotel directly via e-mail. They responded quickly and made the reservation. I had told them that we would be celebrating our 15th anniversary while we were there and also requested a canal view room. I confirmed via e-mail a couple of days prior to our arrival with the time of our flight, etc. We were greeted at the door upon our arrival to the hotel. Check in was a breeze, as they had been waiting for us. We were quite early, so the room was not yet clean, but we were able to freshen up and then get into the city while they held our bags. We came back a couple of hours later and they escorted us up to our room. We were on the third floor (room #7 Leliegracht) - a killer on the legs with those canal house stairs, but worth it. In fact, when we got into the room, there were a few vases with flowers and a bottle of prosecco to celebrate our anniversary. I think the room was fully equipped. Room safe, desk, TV, mini-fridge, good bathroom. The hotel has central heat so you cannot control the temperature, but it was perfect the entire time. The hotel is also a few blocks away from Westerkerk (West Church) which had beautiful bells tolling every 15 minutes. Waking up each morning to church bells was amazing. I cannot say enough great things about this hotel!!!", "Date": "January 16, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Washington, DC", "Title": "\u201cJust back...loved it!\u201d", "Author": "aahowell", "ReviewID": "UR17442877", "Content": "We found the staff to be unusually helpful, kind and charming!

't Hotel is a boutique hotel right on a canal in the heart of the city. It is very quiet, kid friendly, super clean. Very close to the Anne Frank house, great restaurants and shopping. There is not a bar or lounge. We reserved the canal view room and got room 7, top floor. When we got to the room (at 11pm) the crib was set up and there was a baby bath tub waiting for us. At breakfast, which is included, the super attentive owners had already set up a high chair for us. Breakfast consisted of meats, cheese, hard-boiled eggs, yogurt, fruit, breads and granola. Very standard and delicious. The very knowledgeable staff was able to recommend restaurants, call cabs, and guide us in several ways with their fluent English. the ONLY drawback is there is one at all, is that the stairs are very narrow, steep and the ceilings in our room were sloped on one side which made it somewhat challenging for my 6'1\" husband.", "Date": "May 12, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "3", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "New York", "Title": "\u201cGreat experience, perfect location\u201d", "Author": "444Trvlrs", "ReviewID": "UR15673145", "Content": "t Hotel is in a great location, on a pretty canal in the Western Canal belt near the Jordaan.

The staff is fantastic - they answered all our questions and even let us use their computer when we needed internet. We stayed in a room with a garden view (non-canal) and it was charming, bright and quiet. Note, the hotel has quite a few steep stairs to get to the rooms so those with trouble on stairs be wary.

It is situated on a lovely little canal with gorgeous canal houses just 10 mins walk from Anne Frank house, which when you see the queues, proves to be very useful. You can get up early and get there for 9am when it opens. 'T Hotel is fairly well located for most places really as you can hop on a tram or canal bus or even walk. I was slightly disappointed in the hotel -I thought it would be more elegant. It was more a shop with rooms!!! The reception is the shop counter and there is no real \"hotel\" identity. Don't get me wrong the people were lovely and there is a really nice breakfast room which you get to by going just out of the hotel and down the stairs into the basement. Good breakfast and they even provided a packed breakfast for us on the early morning start to the airport. The rooms are adequate and clean but getting on the tired side -few stains on carpet, rusty tiles, chipped paintwork , dusty stairwell etc but still have a homely feel and done out in neutral tones. Our party had 2 rooms at the back overlooking the garden. The beds were VERY comfy and we would have had a good sleep..........BUT the MOSQUITOS were horrendous and it was the end of October so not just a summer problem. I just didn't sleep. They LOVE me and I have come home with about 5 bites on my face which have all swollen up and various on my body. I know that is not the management's fault and they do provide one of those electrical \"zapper\" thingys which does the job but that is what you pay for staying so near the canals I think. I would recommend this hotel for a few days but not a longer stay but take lots of Deet!! There are quite a few brown cafe's around which do good food in the evening very Dutch wholesome stuff and have great atmosphere. There is one just along from 't Hotel but the restaurant with the Michelin star mentioned on the hotel website is very expensive as you would imagine and looked a bit \"stiff\". Don't miss \"The Night watch\" by Rembrandt at the Rijksmuseum or the Anne Frank house which is so moving. The Van Gogh museum is also interesting.", "Date": "October 28, 2007"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "'t Hotel", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g188590-d269682-Reviews-T_Hotel-Amsterdam_Noord_Holland.html", "Price": "$197 - $368*", "Address": "<address class=\"addressReset\"><span rel=\"v:address\"><span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">Leliegracht 18</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:locality\">Amsterdam</span> <span property=\"v:postal-code\">1015 DE</span></span>, <span class=\"country-name\" property=\"v:country-name\">The Netherlands</span> </span></span></address>", "HotelID": "269682", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/ProviderThumbnails/dirs/ed/6a/ed6aae3d4298395e2ae316de446b5e901large.jpg"}}
