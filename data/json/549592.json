I was looking at the location of another hotel on Google Maps,and saw this one listed. After looking it up and inquiring,I decided to reserve it for my 6 night stay,March 6-11,2012. At $109/nt AUD,it was cheaper than most hotels for a private room with ensuite bathroom,and the location seemed to be ideal (short of having a harbour view,that is:) I found the hotel easily upon leaving the Town Hall station. It was located next to a HUGE supermarket,Woolworth's.Upon my arrival,the receptionist Jen greeted me warmly,and locked up my bags since it wasn't time to check in. She seemed genuinely apologetic that there wasn't a room available. She gave me a city map and directions to my first attraction. When I returned a few hours later, I encountered the beginning of a horrific experience with my bank declining my card. Long story short,the night receptionist,Natalia,did what she could to assist me.She helped me plug in my dying cell pone,gave me water, and sympathized. When it became apparent that I couldb't reach my bank or access any funds,she conferred with the manager and allowed me to check in for the night,with the understanding that it would be fixed the next day. She even gave me a free drink voucher for the Mezz Bar,citing that I needed it. She assisted me in carrying my bags up the claustrophobic elevator(very reminiscent of European elevators) while I took the stairs. Upon entering my room, I found it to be clean,small,but bigger than the last single room I had in Europe. There was a queen sized bed,desk,TV,mini-fridge,good sized closet and small bathroom with shower. I was a bit stumped by the two buttons on the toilet,but can assume the difference..... The window faced Park St,and I could see the large Galleries Victoria across the street,along with other stores littering the street,and McDonalds catticorner from the hotel. In the other direction you can see the QVB. Also,beside these two mega shopping complexes,the Pitt St Mall is about 3 minutes away. The next day,as I attempted to resolve my banking woes,the day receptionist Jen was still pleasant and helpful.She lend me a three pronged electric adaptor for my laptop,as well as a hairdryer.Whn I was in tears outside my room,two of the maids took the time to allow me to vent and chatted with me,making me feel better. Although my bank issue lasted throughout the day,I was able to withdraw enough cash to pay for my stay,and Jen was able to put a large amount of my cash in the safe. She was very thorough in securing it in an envelope,and reassured me of the security. During my stay,every receptionist greeted me whenever I entered and left,and always provided advice and tourism tips. I felt very secure as a single woman staying there,even without a receptionist there overnight.The manager stood outside the adjacent bar and watched the locked door of the hotel entrance. Not that it mattered,as the streets of Sydney seemed quite safe,even late at night. My checkout was smooth,and my cash was securely returned to me. The manager even stored my bags when I realized that I left an hour early,so that i could run out and fit in one last walk on the harbor. Overall,the room was clean,comfortable,and safe,which was the basic need I had in a hotel. Add to that,the location was superb,and with the Town Hall station a block away,Circular Quay was 10 minutes away. These two qualities would have been enough for me to give it a high mark,as I dont really notice fading carpets and the like. And I know a lot of people equate great hotels as those posh ones with exquisite views,fancy amenities and luxurious bath products. But to me,customer service is exactly what those at Hotel Coronation provided for me. In time of need,they went above and beyond to assist me and put me at ease.I can't say that the staff at say, a Hilton or Marriott would have done the same. To me,that is worth every dollar I spent and more. Would I stay at Hotel Coronation again or recommend to others?

Perfectly located in the heart of the city within minutes of Town Hall station, a monorail station, dozens of eateries of all types and right next door to a Woolworths supermarket (more on that later). Priced below $120 a night, the rooms are small, but comfy with a tiny, but serviceable bathroom. But nightmares start late at night. Woolworths has a procession of semi-trailers unloading until long after midnight. Slamming the empty produce racks onto the tailgate makes a huge noise, but there are dozens of these trolleys to be loaded over a period of 3 hours. By 1230, they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re normally finished. But it doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t stop there. At 0515 clanging and thumping of beer kegs will break your dreams. A truck driver throws full, steel beer kegs onto the footpath, then slaps them on their side and down the cellar chute. There one of the hotel staff drags then across the concrete floor. The sound travels throughout the hotel. Trying to sleep above on the third floor it sounds like someone dragging concrete pot plants across the floor above. Next night? Same thing, with the hotel manager the culprit. Dragging the empty kegs at 0525 in preparation for the loading on the truck at 0623. Clanging kegs are thrown on back of the truck below the hotel windows. So if you enjoy your sleep, find another hotel. Did I mention the lift? It should be heritage listed. Don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t bother to go to Luna Park \u00e2\u20ac\u201c get your thrills riding in the Coronation lift. The stupid thing is that all these problems can be easily fixed with double glazed windows, changing delivery times and a new, enlightened manager.

We stayed here prior to taking a cruise departing from Sydney but we will not be able to stay again for our next cruise and have booked elsewhere at the Metro in Pitt Street. Its a shame because the location and price were both right. I dont really understand how it happens but on the two nights that we stayed in this hotel, somehow despite the hotel itself being a non smoking hotel with non smoking rooms I gather, we experienced constant cigarette smoke all night. It was somehow getting into the rooms. My guess, and its only a guess is that because the pub section does not allow smoking inside, people step just outside the pub to smoke. There was a light smoke smell during the day when we saw a few people outside the door smoking but not too bad. However, I think that as the night goes on and the pub underneath fills up, more and more people are standing outside perhaps 10 or so at a time all smoking. This smoke then wafts up the stairwell which is adjacent and leads to the hotel acoomodation or somehow travels throughout the entire building through ductwork or channels that we did not bother to investigate. We just knew that unfortunately we could not stay again in future. I found it difficult to breath. Its a shame as I dont really have anything against smoking as such its just that I get sinus trouble if I am exposed to smoke. Anyway, if you are a smoker or dont mind the smell of smoke then this is a good option for a hotel but if you have sinus trouble then only stay as a last resort.", "Date": "October 15, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Singapore, Singapore", "Title": "\u201cfantastic location. good value for money.\u201d", "Author": "richiemccaw", "ReviewID": "UR107303750", "Content": "I got the name of this hotel off an internet forum and decided to run along with it.

There is a Woolworths right next door with shopping malls, shopping streets, cinemas and many places to eat nearby. It did not really sink in until I went to stay in Bounce Hotel for the last two nights of my stay (wanted to check that place out). Admittedly the rooms are not of the best standards but for at the price point (AU$109/night) and the location, you really cant expect that much. The restroom/shower area was clean and adequate space-wise. The TV is small and slightly spoilt so unless you are planning to spend a lot of time in the room, that would not be much of an issue. Both of us slept very very well throughout the night even though the hotel was right smack in the city centre. The staff at the reception was excellent too. They were very helpful when we needed directions to places like Sydney Fish Market. I would definitely recommend this hotel to travellers who are on a budget and just require a place to have a good night's sleep.

We were very happy with the lady who took the booking & we opted for a slightly more expensive 'suite' on her advice which had a couch etc & a bit more room for this longer stay. Upon checking in we were required to pay for the entire week in advance (!) In the bathroom, the handbasin was cracked all the way through, the towel rack above the toilet on a precarious lean, the vent had no cover so you could see right into the dirty & dusty piping in the ceiling (we were on the top floor) and the bed was on a definite 'lean' to one side. The TV remote did not work and you could only get 2 channels anyway. Every time the old-style lift operated there was a very loud 'clunk clunk' as it locked into the desired floor (apparently the machinery was beside/above our room) - so you can imagine how many times a day/night that happened. We asked if we could change rooms as soon as we noticed these things & was told \"No, we are full, maybe if someone checks out \" Refund was not an option either. As we had specifically requested a 'quieter' room when booking many months prior you can imagine our disappointment. After a totally sleepless night our room was changed the next afternoon another 'suite' lower down - this one too had bits missing in the bathroom & the maid had 'forgotten' to leave towels, soap & toilet paper, but did leave hairs on the sheets etc. We were told that the usual housekeeper was on holidays & they just 'couldn't get good staff' from the agencies! On the Saturday night there was a reception of some sort held in their function room. There was one floor between the microphone & our bed but no matter, we heard every drunken speech, every lyric to every song..I rang the Duty Manager after 11.30 pm to ask when would we expect some quiet & he said 2 AM ! I felt so sorry for the people under us - they must have been deafened (or maybe they were at the reception?) Anyhow, the next day the receptionist said that someone should have told us there were noisy functions like that so we could choose whether to stay or not. Nope, no-one had told us at check-in, the day before, or even that day so we could have made alternative arrangements. There was no apology from the Manager, he said \"We're a pub, not a 5 star hotel, it's noisy, what do you expect?\" and basically \"If you don't like it you can always stay elsewhere\". Well yes, maybe if you had given us our money back for the remainder of our stay we would have! I looked at rooms at the Park Regis virtually next door and they were so much better than the Hotel Coronation in all respects for only a few $$$ more I was so sorry we had not been able to move there. I have since booked our neighbours into the Park Regis TWICE since then & both times they have been really well looked after for the staff & loved it (and only paid $125 a night as they have a aged pension card - even less than the Coronation 'suite'). Yes, the location is really convenienct only 50 metres from Town Hall station. But do yourself a favour - stay at the Park Regis!", "Date": "October 18, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Florida", "Title": "\u201cWe LOVED the Coronation\u201d", "Author": "CHKFlorida", "ReviewID": "UR7727178", "Content": "My husband and I stayed at the Coronation for a week in April prior to a cruise back to the US. Three other couples on the same cruise also stayed there--and we all were extremely happy with the hotel, the accommodations, food, bar, location, everything. For the price and location, the place is an absolute gem! The rooms are on the small side but were plenty big enough to accommodate the two of us and all of our gear (4 big suitcases, 2 carry-on bags and the 2 cases of wine we hauled on board the ship) The largest rooms face an interior \"courtyard\"--just an empty concrete space that holds the utilities (for AC and such). The rooms facing the street were about 1/4 to 1/3 smaller. All of the rooms were quiet and comfortable--and spotlessly clean. I swear they changed the sheets every day. Our bathroom had a small corner glass enclosure around the shower--apparently not all baths have the enclosures so you might want to ask. Each room has a refrigerator, a pot for heating water, plus glasses, cups, saucers and other essentials. There's an iron and ironing board in the closet. You can get a dryer by asking at the desk (if they seem to be out--ask them to check the housekeeping closet which is where one of the front desk clerks likes to stash them) The only minus I can think of with regard to the rooms is the limited number of TV channels--but we didn't go all the way to Australia to watch TV, so it wasn't a big deal. The food in the bar and restaurant was excellent, served in very generous portions, and very inexpensive. We esp. enjoyed getting together with the other \"cruisers\" in the bar for a beer after a hard day of sightseeing. My husband's lite beer cost only $2 AU (and the same beer was only $1 in the Coronation bottle shop right next door--compare this with $7 for the same beer at the Four Seasons!) And, of course, the location was fantastic--right next to Woolies and the Town Center railway station and just across from the Queen Victoria Building. We even found a 24 hr internet cafe about 2 blocks away that only charges $1.50 per hour (approx. 161 Elizabeth St) I guess some people might get put off by the lack of a proper lobby or the funky self-service elevator--but we thought it was perfect for our stay and would stay there again in a heartbeat.", "Date": "June 1, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Basingstoke", "Title": "\u201cNice clean hotel\u201d", "Author": "darren267", "ReviewID": "UR6935975", "Content": "I agree with most of the other comments on here, we stayed for a few nights and the room was an ok size, but was clean and tidy and that was more important.

We spent 5 nights here over New Years and thoroughly recommend it. We chose this hotel as it was in a great location and one of the few places that wasn't charging silly prices over New Years. It charged about $30AUD per night extra for 2 nights. Most places were doubling their prices. It's regular rates ($109AUD) are one of the best around in central Sydney for an ensuite room with aircon (which we needed on 1st Jan - 44 degrees!!). The room we had was fairly small, but this was because we had one of only 2 rooms with a balcony (rooms 402 and 403), which 'eat' into the room, but we were more than happy to compensate that for a balcony overlooking a bustling street. Despite being in a busy area we found the room very quiet (which was good to sleep off the jet lag) and the hotel in general was quiet - there are 21 rooms - and we only once or twice bumped into someone. The beds was really comfy and the ensuite was clean and decent sized. The Coronation also has: - a nice 24 hour bar - a bottle shop (handy for a few drinks in your room/balcony, as each room has a fridge). - a restaurant - cheapish prices for a place where you can get anything from oysters and champagne to beer and a burger. Most reviews are generally based on 'value for money' and mine's no different. It's not a world class hotel but for it's price I can't say a bad word against it. It's a great lowish budget 'classic' hotel but with all the trimmings (aircon, ensuite, tv, fridge, restaurant, bar) in a great area of the city.", "Date": "January 22, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "3.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Scottsdale, AZ", "Title": "\u201cDecent and good price... considering the location\u201d", "Author": "Tombraider74", "ReviewID": "UR4366490", "Content": "Good things: great location downtown with a supermarket, train station and 24 hour bar right next door(nighttime doorman at the bar very nice); in the heart of the city: George Street; only about a 15-20 minute walk to Darling Harbor and the Rocks; I paid only $109AU which aint too bad!
