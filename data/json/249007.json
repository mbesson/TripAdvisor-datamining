The room was spacious (two people in the bedroom and I was in the living room on the pullout couch.) The bathroom was a nice size and the furnishings were complete. It is not a luxury hotel, but was very comfortable and suited our needs perfectly. The front desk staff were always very warm and welcoming whenever we headed out for the day or came back at night. And the neighborhood is really beautiful! It is an upscale part of the city, and you are steps from a major shopping district and only about a 15-20 minute walk to the gorgeous Parque Retiro. If you're a runner, I cannot recommend this park enough, as it is gorgeous and there is a lot to see! Would definitely recommend this hotel to others.", "Date": "July 12, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Waukesha, Wisconsin", "Title": "\u201cFriendly and good location.\u201d", "Author": "wiscobic", "ReviewID": "UR129404388", "Content": "Second stay here this year. My wife and daughter stayed here when she moved out to study in Madrid for the semester. This time my wife and I when we visited our daughter. Very helpful staff and the rooms are nice and clean with tons of storage space. We got a very good deal through Booking.com on this trip. I would avoid signing up for the breakfast buffet since it is too expensive (12 euros per person). We found we could get a nice breakfast for about half the price on Calle de Diego de Leon (10 minute walk). This is not to say the buffet isn't nice, it is. Only a 5 minute walk from the Manuel Becerra Metro station. I would stay here again for sure.", "Date": "May 5, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Logrono, Spain", "Title": "\u201cGood Location and Spacious Rooms\u201d", "Author": "lpkspain", "ReviewID": "UR129289561", "Content": "Excellent price-quality ratio.

The place was well appointed but no kitchen and the neighborhood is a bit away from the sites. It's about a 20 minute plus walk to any major sites. I think this is a more business oriented hotel than a tourist hotel. You can take the metro but cab rides will cost you roughly 10 Euro to get you to anywhere of significance. On a positive side, this is the high end neighborhood and there's good food and shopping here.", "Date": "March 6, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Swindon", "Title": "\u201cGreat hotel\u201d", "Author": "Jacabus", "ReviewID": "UR82596603", "Content": "Stayed two nights. Shared a room with a colleague to keep costs down. The room was a suite with a living room equipped with a desk, a table, a mini bar, flat screen TV, and a leather sofa which converts to a double sofa bed. The bedroom has two single beds (our request) and the bathroom was of a good standard. We took a room each, and I can assure you the sofa bed is very comfortable. Front of house staff staff nice and helpful. Quiet street, close to metro and lots of traditional cafes and tapas bars nearby. Free wifi. Dont book breakfast, they have a few options in the hotel which are less than the price offered on booking sites, so pay separately if you want to eat here.
