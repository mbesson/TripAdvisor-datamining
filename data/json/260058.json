I started out in the hostel which is located downstairs with absolutely no sound-proofing. I was awake all night due to the girls chatting and smoking in the smoking area which was located directly outside my the room with only glass between me and the nicotine addicts, and the drunk American outside my door crying hysterically into her cell phone and kicking the door to her room to try and wake up her other drunk and passed-out friends because she had lost her key. I went to the desk the next day to see if I could switch to the hotel portion and it was twice as much but I needed the sleep. I honestly can't say which was worse. There is no sweep or padding on the doors to eliminate hallway noise and the elevator was located right outside my door. I don't know about anyone else, but when I stay at a hotel I always try to be quiet when I walk down the hall to my room. It's my age I guess. The Scottish boys in the next room came home reeking of McDonald's and screaming their heads off and proceeded to play a game of soccer in their room kicking the ball against the walls. I asked them to please keep it down as it was about 1am and they basically just laughed me off. They kept it up and about an hour later a made a trip to the front desk but not until after I tripped over the bags of discarded McDonald's food bags that had been thrown in front of my door. The front desk threatened to call the police if they boys didn't quiet down but it took them another hour or so to finally pass out. Bottom line, the hotel does not care about it's guests and as long as people continue to come there because it is cheap and their partying won't be disturbed then it will continue to be business as usual. I'm really not surprised to hear that other guests had things stolen, I came back to my room in the hotel one afternoon to find the door wide open and carpenters coming in and out to repair something or other.

I forgot to check reviews before booking, so I got kinda spooked when reading the other reviews here. That being said I figured, well it is cheap, so I'll try it and see for myself. And what a good thing, because everything I saw in negative reviews, or almost everything, was proven wrong when I arrived. The hotel is not located in the middle of city, but it's close enough, so that it is worth it. Keep in mind that I had a broken leg while staying there. The guy in the reception, when we arrived, must have been the jerk other people wrote about, because he had nothing to do in the service business, it was painfully obvious that he hates tourists, and his job. But I am not staying on a hotel to make friends with the staff, so that didn't matter. The elevator looks brand new, so the reviews where the elevator was the main issue are no longer valid. The stairs are steap, but no where near the steapest I seen in Amsterdam. And on my broken leg I went up and down the stairs with luggage and all, so no one should complaint over that. The room on the second floor had a view of the canal and De Nederlandse Bank, the dutch national bank. less than 100 meters from the hotel you'll find the Albert Cuyp Market. The included breakfast was really nice, compared to the price. All you an eat, including bread, eggs, youghurt, cereal, milk, juice, cocoa, coffee and tea. The only thing missing was a smoking room in the hotel, but the weather was really nice, so we went across the street to sit on the bench at the canal. I am going to stay at this hotel again that is for sure! The closest coffeeshop is a sportsbar, called Ibiza Coffeeshop, located about 150 meters from the hotel. Right past the Lidl Supermarket. They have good smoke, and great prices, but the guy working there needs anotherjob, because he doesn't like working in the service business, as most of the jerks working in coffeeshops and other places in Amsterdam. On my next visit I am going to try stealing one of their jobs, because I am much better at their job, than they will ever be. I didn't try Mellow Yellow, so can't say how that one is, but it is also close. My favorite coffeeshop on the way to the city centre is Stix, which is located on Utrechtsestraat, which starts right after the Frederiksplein park. I not only would recommend this hotel, I would say that for the priceaware traveller, this hotel is defenetly worth every penny.

The stairs to our room where very very steep - which was ok but you would need to request a ground floor room if you have trouble with stairs. Transport links excellent - Tram number 4 direct to city centre, just accross the road. Found a FAB market just round the corner.

View towards inner courtyard was not very nice and made the room very dark. This was nothing however compared to the sleepless nights we had. We are not in anyway against partying and enjoy a good night out as anyone else, but this was ridiculous. All night partying with smoking anything but normal cigarettes which filled the corridors and our room with a nasty smell. The fire alarm kept coming on during the nights and we had receptionstaff coming into the room during the night to check if it was us smoking...

We walked in everyday and thoroughly enjoyed the opportunity of exploring some of the less well known areas, little markets, antique shops etc. It's also near the Heineken Museum if that's your kind of thing.

We booked the hotel with a little apprehension however I'm gald to report we had a great stay. As you can imagine, hitting Amsterdam mid August accommodation wasnt easy to find.

We had a double room overlooking the canal. The room was bright and looked like it had been recently refurbished. The ensuite was clean and shower was great. We had a continental breakfast included in the price and although it was quite basic there was plenty of it. Staff were friendly and helpful and they offered luggage storage on our departure day. The only slight flaw was that the room was very warm and although we had a fan the windows didnt open.

She greeted us warmly and recommended local places to eat and shop. It was shocking later to deal with the girl who took over in the early evening - she was unbelievably rude, literally picking fights with us as we entered and exited the hotel - I cannot express just how unpleasant this girl was. The room was very small, as was the bathroom, and the stairs were so steep, we had to make several trips to retrieve our bags. Another complaint - the only way to make calls from the room is through a long distance carrier that asks for a credit card number. Although they quote you a low connection fee, we are now fighting charges of up to $50 per call. I reccommend you go to an internet cafe instead, there are several along the Albert Cuyp street market. There you can make an internationl call for approx. 10 cents per minute. The breakfast at the hotel was mediocre. One morning we arrived 5 minutes after 10am, and since other guests were still eating, we hoped to grab a roll and jam for the road. Instead, the server gave us a dirty look and quickly pulled dishes of food off of the counter and put them away in the kitchen. Overall, the hotel has great potential, but the management should look into improving the attitude of its staff and encouraging them to be pleasant to their guests.", "Date": "April 4, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "3.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Huddersfield, England", "Title": "\u201cNot as bad as people say!!!\u201d", "Author": "Meech1980", "ReviewID": "UR4896702", "Content": "5 of us (all girls) stayed at Hotel Linda in October 2005.
