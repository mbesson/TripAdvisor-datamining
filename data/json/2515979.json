Considering the hotel's 2 star rating (we have been told by a friend who works in hotels that in USA this refers to the facilities on offer, not necessarily the standard of decor etc) we were not expecting it to be anything special. In fact, we were pleasantly surprised. It is in an old building and the narrow reception foyer was being renovated during our stay though this didn't cause any problems. The staff were welcoming and helpful with how to get to places. There is complimentary wifi in the bedrooms and complimentary hot drinks in recption as well as an ice machine and snack machine. Another nice touch is that there is a computer and printer in the lounge reception where your can print flight boarding passes for free! The room we had on the 10th floor had great views over the skyline. The bed was comfortable and the room, nicely decorated, modern and very clean. Only slight thing is the bath towels are rather small- not bath sheet size at all! But if that's my only complaint then it ca't be bad! The location is excellent, next to China town and short walk to Union square- the main shopping area, and also close to many excellent restaurants and cafes. Across the road are a couple of cafes which do excellent breakfasts. For such a central location, it provides excellent value for money and would stay here again if we are lucky enough to go to San Francisco another time!", "Date": "May 2, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Sydney, Australia", "Title": "\u201cVery good, comfortable hotel\u201d", "Author": "Lana_S720", "ReviewID": "UR129225164", "Content": "Stayed here in April 2012.

It's near the BART, various bus stops, the cable cars, etc. The area seemed safe (near Chinatown and Union Square). We stayed here for 4 nights, and I only have a few minor complaints. As many others have written, the shower curtain is incredibly annoying. The bathroom sink is maybe one of the smallest I've ever seen. The remote and hairdryer are attached to the furniture. Lastly, the elevator is really slow. As you can see, these are minor issues, and nothing that would prevent me from giving this hotel 5 stars.

It's 100 feet from China Town's Gate, approximately 5 minutes to Union Square and just a few minutes from all the Muni-bus stops which can take you all over the city. This is also one of main stop for all you folks who would like to do a double Decker city bus tours. With many restaurants, bars/wine bars near by to choose from, you will not be disappointed. We opted to eat all over China Town so perfect location for us. The streets were well lit and you always feel safe walking around. Don't listen to other whiner posters who say differently. IT IS CLEAN AND SAFE all hours of the night. The Hotel was older but it is charming. They were in the process of renovation while we were there so when they get done, I'm sure its going to be beautiful. The room was small but adequate for the two of us. If you have more than two I would ask for a larger room. Housekeeping did a terrific job of keeping our room clean and follow our small request with no issues. The hotel offers free coffee 24/7 but did not offer any complimentary breakfast. No bagel, no muffins , nothing at all for breakfast :-( That was the only negative that I can see. We requested a room with street view and received the room #802 on 8th floor. The room has a nice view of China Town's gate as well as other city building; however, down side to that is that you can hear the trucks and garbage pick up late in the night (2-3 am). It's loud enough to wake you up in dead sleep and can keep you up. If you want a peaceful night of sleep than ask to be away from the outside window. I have to thank the staffs of this hotel. They were SUPER friendly, polite and just plain courteous. It was really a pleasure to see. They all went out their way to help us plan our travel around town by drawing up maps and bus stops each day and every time we asked with a smile or laugh. We honestly enjoyed their attitudes and well manor behavior . THANKS FOR ALL YOUR HELP ESPECIALLY THE YOUNG LADY AT THE FRONT DESK.

We took the Bart to and from the Airport, we took the buses to the mission, and we took the trollies to the warf. You can't beat that! We didn't have any problems with noise, though I could see how people would be bothered by trucks at night. One of the nights when they picked up the trash you could hear it pretty well, but we just closed the window a little and that was that.

We were very happy with the entire stay. The hotel is small and very old, but has a lot of character and is newly renovated. We stayed in Room 904 on the 9th floor on the advice of other reviewers. We requested a room that was not in the front of the hotel or near the elevator. We didn't have a view, since we were on the side of the building, but we didn't mind it. It was quiet. The room was spotlessly clean and everything in our room was new. It had a flat screen tv and we had a regular tub in our bathroom, not a claw foot tub. The room was a little small with the 2 beds, but the closet was spacious and so was the bathroom. We had plenty of room for the 2 of us. There was a safe in the closet, hair dryer, iron/ironing board - all the usual amentities, except coffee. You need to go to the lobby for coffee or tea, but that was ok for us. The ice and vending machines are also in the lobby. The radiator is loud and makes strange squealing noises. We called it the pig :-) The pig woke up the first night when the heat was turned on and we called downstairs to have them turn it off. A man came up immediately and shut off the valve. It squealed some more during the first night, but we didn't hear anything for the next 2 nights since it was shut off. Yes, the pipes also squeal when you shower, but that didn't bother us. We normally travel with ear plugs due to snoring, so we really weren't bothered by noises and slept really well. The staff at the Baldwin was impressive! Very nice, very friendly and so helpful in telling us about the city, how to get to certain places by public transportation and good restaurants to eat in. The towel animals on the bed each day was a plus! The location of the hotel was incredible! You walk out the front door and to the left are the gates to Chinatown. There were so many restaurants and shops. We took 2 trips into Chinatown. To the right are high-end clothing stores like Armani, Betsy Johnson, Coach, etc. and the hotel is only a few blocks to the buses and cable cars.

I had read enough reviews to know what I was getting for my $ especially given how expensive San Fran is, so my expectations were well adjusted! If you are looking for a crisp, brand new hotel - this is not the place for you. If you are looking for a clean, cozy hotel with great service - bingo! The check-in was smooth, and I was pre-billed as I had the package through PriceLine (about $130 per night).The room we got was on the 9th floor (901) facing the street. It was cozy, clean and the bed was comfortable - not too lumpy, not too hard. The tv channels were adequate, the closet was great for storage and the view out to the street was nice. The room has a safe, which was handy. There was also free wi-fi in the room, so that was helpful in planning our next stops, directions etc. On the downside, as with most hotels in San Fran, its an older hotel, and the elevator really shows its age and takes a long time to arrive. We were also in the room right next to the elevator, so in the night, we kept hearing the elevator churning - thankfully only until about midnight, then it started again around 7am. I initially asked to be moved to another room, and the front desk was very nice and accommodating and agreed to show me a room on the 2nd floor. But there was a \"homeiness\" about the 9th floor room, so we decided to keep it. The heating system is also old so there were weird noises from that. Now for the real reason we stayed here - the location is EXCELLENT!Looking out the front windows you can see Banana Republic right on the corner. Chinatown Gate is right on your doorstep so access to a lot of food choices. For breakfast, there is Cafe Presse (lovely french caf\u00e9 - try the Cafe Latte!) and Starbucks right on Grant St. Being Union Square area, there are lots of shopping options in this area including Macy's, DSW, Gap, Walgreens. For public transit, there are cable car stops to the Fishermans' Wharf on Powell Street and MUNI buses that can take you to the Golden Gate Bridge for only $2 per ride! Its a hotel to come and only spend a few hours to get clean, some rest and get out and enjoy San Fran.

My husband and I walked almost the entire city from this location. The price was the biggest draw for us and although the room was very basic, it had everything we needed including a very nice bathroom and comfortable bed. The maids also do the cutest towel animals each day. Our biggest complaint and reason I did not give this hotel 5 stars is the street noise. I was SO excited to get a nice city view when we first entered the room and we slept very well both Friday and Saturday nights. Sunday night however, we were awoken TWICE by banging, screeching, beeping garbage trucks going down a nearby alley. Two different sets cleaned the dumpsters that night and this took 1 hour each time they came....(no idea why two separate trucks came and did the same thing). So after that evening we figured the dumpsters were empty and we wouldn't have to deal with it again since they didn't come on Friday or Saturday so we didn't ask to change rooms. But we were wrong. They came again and did the same thing our remaining two nights.

We picked the Baldwin Hotel for its location, good price and positive reviews. The hotel was perfect for us - great location, good sized room with a big closet, surprisingly quiet. It has less of a hotel feeling and more of feeling like a house (the doors have actual keys rather than cards!) and I really don't have any complaints at all about the hotel itself. But, we did have a disappointing experience with customer service that tainted our stay. We were in Vancouver before heading to SF, and the night before our flight my husband got a terrible case of food poisoning from our dinner. He was so sick there was no way we could travel the next day and we had to change our flight to the following day. So, instead of spending the 4 nights we at the Baldwin we had planned, we missed the first night and were there for 3 nights. I called them right away to let them know we would be a day late. It is their policy to charge you for the night unless you have a doctor's note as proof of illness -- which we of course didn't, since we were in Canada and my husband didn't need a doctor, he just needed to get through it and rest for a day. We explained the situation to them multiple times and they just wouldn't budge. Now of course I understand this is their policy, but it's always disappointing when a place of business won't be flexible in extreme circumstances -- it wasn't like we never showed up for our reservation, we got there as soon as we could and still stayed for 3 nights. And the night that we missed was a Monday night -- surely not a busy night where they would have lost money by not renting the room to someone else. It was just frustrating - it was hard to lose a day of our vacation and lose the extra money from having to pay for double hotel rooms that night on top of it. I find that most places of business in that kind of situation will be more understanding. After talking to several people, they finally offered us a complimentary night's stay through the end of this year, but wouldn't let us apply it to the night we missed - and we obviously aren't going back to SF this year, so it wasn't really worth anything. Oh well - it really is a good hotel for price and location and I liked the room - just not so much for above and beyond customer service.

We were a short walk from museums, shopping, restaurants and bars and felt comfortable taking the bus back from Haight later at night after going out over there (plenty of public transportation stops are on Market Street, just a few blocks away). The room was no frills but rather spacious, and VERY clean and quiet. The staff was WONDERFUL, always providing directions and recommendations on places to eat.

The location is prime, right off Union Square, within walking distance to most everything. Gold star for that. Value - well, for 75.00/night, I cannot complain on the financial front. The Hotel is very clean, the cleaning service impeccable and efficient, the desk staff friendly and outgoing. No faults there. It comes down to this: For a hotel, a business in the business of providing you a place to lay your head, The Baldwin is noisy noisy noisy. And that's where I can only afford a poor rating to sleep quality. While the hotel has been recently renovated, had they gone the extra mile and replaced the dual key lock system and the thin doors, this might be a different review. People arriving late at night next to us on 3 different nights jangled keys, fumbled, cursed, banged around, all in an attempt to get into the rooms adjacent to us. This was at 11:30, 1:30, and 2:45 am respectively (or rather, lack-of-respect-ively) As well, older wooden doors bang and creak. The Baldwin's room doors hit those jarring notes in spades. Key card locks would have been a better renovation solution, coupled with quiet-close doors. It always astonishes me that more hotels don't do this. Rooms to the front suffer from the late night noise of Grant Avenue traffic and crowds, rooms in the middle hear every creak and groan of the over-worked elevator, and rooms next to the alley (where we were, have the constant drone and vibration of the enormous exhaust fan from the car park in behind. Double-glazed glass only barely muffles these noises. It does absolutely nothing at all to block the noise of a dozen dumpsters being uploaded every night in the alley by San Francisco's sanitation services - the backup beeping, the shouts, the clang as dumpster after dumpster is tossed around. All at ungodly hours between 1:30 and 4 am. Every . . single . . .day. Earplugs and an extra pillow over the head, you'll still be woken bolt upright when those trucks come. It may be slightly better on the 9th or 10th floors, but we were on the 8th, and you still picked up every noise down below. Other than the noise, the Baldwin is a good hotel. If you are a heavy sleeper, then you'll not do better than this hotel for value and location. If you're a lighter sleeper, well, you've been advised.", "Date": "August 1, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "2", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Sydney, Australia", "Title": "\u201cLittle gem in a great location\u201d", "Author": "Lee_g15", "ReviewID": "UR71720059", "Content": "We stayed at The Baldwin Hotel for 2 nights.

It's probably not often that one cant come up with any major criticisms of a budget hotel. If one takes the Baldwin at face value-ie. a budget option it really is a stretch to come up with any criticism's. The hotel is well located-as all reviewers point out just down teh road from the main entrance to China Town.Walk staright down Grant St and North Beach is an easy 25 min stroll with Fisherman;s Wharf being an additional 10 minutes or so. If not inclined to walk buses in Stockton St (one block over) run through North Beach ( a must visit) to the Wharf. Back to the Baldwin- rooms are smallish,as is the norm in SF,no aircon,but ceiling fan which worked well-windows open fully which is a real plus.Had room facing Grant St which is noisy with windows open,but once closed,the noise level abates considerably. A safe for valuables is provided and the bathrooom is perfectly functional and spotless. Hot water was always available.The housekeeping staff were excellent and make little arrangements with the towels,which are then left on the bed- a really nice touch. To sum up the Baldwin is an excellent budgey choice-for $75 a night its got to be very hard value to beat.

The first impression wasn't that good due to the size of our room & bed, apparently the room also missed air conditioner, but actually we never needed one while staying there. The more we stayed, the more we liked the place. The temperature in the room was comfortable (at least they had a big fan on the ceiling), there were 3 windows (one in the bathroom, which we especially liked). The bed appeared to be quite comfortable for two. The room had a closet and a lock box, and we found enough space for our luggage. The staff was very friendly and helpful, there was no problem to store the luggage after we checked out. Towels and linen were changed every day even though we didn't ask for it. Every night we kept on finding a funny animal made out of small towels on the bed, so we were happy to leave some tips to the maid. It seemed that the staff made its best to make our stay enjoyable. The Grant Ave was mostly quiet, though it's only 3 min walk from Union Square, and the Chinatown gate is just next door, so we couldn't imagine any better location. The hotel missed a lot of amenities, such as free wifi & parking (public parking nearby costed about $26-30 per night), any food service etc. But there were anough of nice cafes & eateries nearby, and for the price we paid we had probably the best place to stay in this area.

It was our first time staying in the City and had no idea what to expect. We had done quite a bit of research online so we knew that affordable hotels in San Francisco are much different than hotels we stay at in other areas. So we went with very few expectations, knowing we would probably have a tiny room, in a run-down hotel, with zero amenities. We showed up to the Baldwin 2 hours before check-in time. We were greeted by a very friendly staff who offered for us to leave our luggage behind the counter until our room was ready for us. We had reserved our room under the Holiday Shopping Package ($220 for 2 nights)which included free parking in their parking garage around the corner, so he gave us our parking pass and mapped out the directions to the parking garage. He even came out to the car to unload our bags for us. We then drove around the corner to the parking garage, gave the attendant the pass and our keys, and took off walking while they parked our car for us. After exploring Chinatown, (the hotel is less than a block away from the Chinatown Gate) we returned to the hotel about 20 minutes before check-in time, in which our room was ready. We headed up the small elevator to our room on the third floor. Our first impression upon reaching the third floor was the strange smell in the hallway and the door to our room which angled rather close to the door next to ours. To our surprise, the inside of the room was rather nice. Much more than we were expecting. The furniture is modern and new as advertised. The decor is typical hotel decor but the flat screen tv on the dresser across from the bed distracted us from the ugly comforter and curtains. The bathroom was clean with newer features. The shower was an old clawfoot tub with a wrap-around curtain. The best part for me was the ceiling fan above the bed. The best part for my husband was the tv of course. The large window in our room faced the alleyway and the building next to the hotel so the view wasn't great, but it probably helped a little with the noise. The window was new and opened easily and wide. There was no screen on the window but bugs weren't an issue. Just having the nice breeze circulating in the room made what could have been a semi-stuffy hotel room, a cool place to relax. The bed was pretty good for a hotel bed. The sheets and comforter were soft, not starchy. The mattress was solid, but not hard. It had some bit of soft padding on top that helped. Everytime we entered or exited the building, the person at the front desk would say hello, and have a good day/night. They were always very friendly and spoke english rather well. The front door of the hotel locks at 9pm every night for security purposes, so upon checking-in the give you a key to the front door in case you return after 9. We returned around 10 every night, in which the deskperson would see us and open the door automatically. We felt special being let in instead of having to fiddle with a lock in the dark. The only legitimate complaints I have about staying at the Baldwin which really aren't fair because it was out of their control, are the noise and the slow/malfunctioning elevator. The noise in San Francisco is unavoidable so sleeping with your window open is not an option in most locations but even with our window closed, you could hear lots of banging and horns honking. The problem with the elevator wasn't a big deal as there was a flight of stairs right next to them, in case we didn't feel like waiting. Apparently, the elevator was stopping for 30 seconds on the 4th floor everytime it would go up or down so it was causing quite a delay. We never saw anyone else get on or off the elevator so traffic wasn't an issue. Being on the third floor, we took the stairs a couple times to avoid waiting. The hotel staff did post a note of apology inside and outside the elevator explaining the problem. Check-out at 11pm was painless and took all of 20 seconds. We walked our bags down to the parking garage, although if you prefer you could go get your car first and come back for your luggage. We handed the parking attendant our stub, he returned with our car, and we were on our way home. Just like that! We were impressed at how smooth everything went. No problems whatsover. Everyone was friendly, courteous, and did their job well. For all you coffee lovers, the hotel might have served coffee in the morning( I never checked), but there is also a Starbucks 3 doors down from the hotel. There are plenty of different eating establishments within a block or two of the hotel, as well as bus and cable car stops nearby. Traveling from our hotel to the various attractions around the city was easy with the help of a map and a little pre-trip research. I would recommend this hotel to a friend, as it exceeded what few expectations we had. We were very pleased with our choice of hotel within our price range. It met our needs for location and affordable, and ended up being a really nice place to stay.

We took advantage of the stay 3 nights and get a free tour for 2 package (very good deal). We were given a free tour operated by a 3rd party tour company that took us on a 3 hour ride to all the main locations around SF. We stayed in a queen room (1 queen bed only) which was quite small, but the room and bathroom was clean and tidy (nothing special though). It was a surprise to have a LCD TV in the room but it buzzed on certain channels. The heating system (no A/C, just a fan in the ceiling for summers) also made funny sound from time to time during the night which was slightly unpleasant (but this is probably room specific). Overall I recommend this hotel for the budget conscience but still wanting a private and comfortable stay. The location is top notch with an easy bus ride on 8A bus to fisherman's wharf. If you are staying for 3 days or so make sure you get the $18 unlimited metro travel for 3 days. This is available at the visitor centre opposite Macy's. This allows you to travel unlimited on bus/muni/tram (which is otherwise $5), although we found the tram more of a novelty than a viable transport solution. This pass doesn't cover Bart though.

Overall I was impressed enough to reccomend this hotel in terms of location and value for money. It is a simple, no frills property located in an older style building. Check in staff were efficent, room was quite small but again, met our needs. The real selling point is location. Turn left at the hotel entrance and It is steps away from Chinatown gate which if you walk through will lead you through this area, down Columbus (Italian Quarter) and eventually down to Fisherman's Wharf. (approx 30min walk) Turn right instead and you are 5 min walk from Cable Car turnaround, 10 min walk to Market street, Union Square and the BART station (cheap and easy way of getting to and from the airport) The hotel is for the budget aware among us. If price of accomodation is not an issue then choose somewhere else but in a similar location. However, if like me you treat your room as little more than a crash pad and somewhere to freshen up between siteseeing and dinner then this hotel will suit your needs well. San Francisco is a very walkable city and the public transport links are pretty decent. In this respect, I would highly reccomend staying in this area as opposed to down at the Wharf where, it is more touristy. It is truely a beautiful city. Some highlights include: cable car to lombard st... hop off... walk down and up to Coit Tower... beautiful views bike the bridge but continue on into Sausalito... explore this lovely bayside community with art gallaries and cafe culture before you and your bike catch the ferry back to the Wharf.... beats cycling back!.. P.S. biking the bridge is a tougher ride than they let on. Go do Napa for the day... Take the nighttime Alcatraz tour instead of the daytime... far superior and atmospheric as dusk and then dark settles while you are out on 'the rock' You will love SF and if you are ok with no frills accomodation then you will love the Baldwin", "Date": "November 25, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "rocklingirl82", "Title": "\u201cExcellent Value in a Great Location\"\u201d", "Author": "rocklingirl82", "ReviewID": "UR50012837", "Content": "A great find!

The staff we dealt with were all very helpful and friendly, allowing us to check in early on arrival and we asked them to recommend a chinese restaurant which they did (probably a relative!) and it was fabulous. The location is ideal - minutes walk from Chinatown and Union Square. The price was also great - far cheaper than staying at Fishermans Wharf. The only (slight) problem we had was with parking - upon arrival we were asked if we needed parking and said yes. They gave us a card and told us it was down the block and first left (Sutter Street) so off we went. When we checked out 2 days later, we found we had gone to the wrong car park (there must be 2 on Sutter Street and the one the hotel use is the second one) - this wasn't a problem for us as we hadn't moved the car but beware if you plan to drive anywhere and make sure you find the right car park as the one were in is charged by the hour. By not moving our car it cost us about $2 less than the hotel were charging for 'their' car park but I'm sure parking in theirs would allow you to take your car in and out for the one standard price (about $25 per day).

We were not very happy about having to pay for internet connection, even if you use the hotel's PC in the lobby ( at $5 for 20 minutes ). One would need to pay for internet connection in the room as well - not sure how much the internet card is, though. 2. If you do choose to stay in this hotel, please get a room away from the lift because, as mentioned in an earlier review, you can hear the noisy lift shaft from your room every time it's being used. Having said that, the location is great - less than 5 minutes walk to Union Square, lots of cafes in the area and Loehmann's ( designer clothing/accessory bargain store ) just around the corner. You can catch the cable car about 1.5 blocks away - a mere 3 minute stroll from the hotel. There is no breakfast served in the hotel but there is coffee and tea in the lobby every morning. That should not deter anyone as you can get a nice breakfast in any of the cafes nearby. Although this hotel is right in front of the Chinatown gate, one would still have to walk a few blocks to get Chinese food as the stores right after the Gate sells mostly antiques and oriental souvenirs. The restaurant/bar called E&O Trading Company on Sutter Street ( just around the corner from the hotel ) is really worth trying - great Southeast Asian food in a lovely environment.

The Baldwin is more than central, right at the gates of China Town and just a few blocks from Union Square. We originally booked a double room and then decided to upgrade to a queen. However, when we were shown the room the bed looked awfully small, like a 3/4 size, but when we checked with reception we were assured that it was in fact a queen size room. (I think this may be a language barrier between Americans and Brits so do check before booking, I think perhaps the double could have been a twin!!) Anyway, the room was in no way a problem. The bed was small, but cosy (boyfriend is 6ft 4); the room and bathroom were cleaned every day (left a 2 dollar tip every day). The sheets were clean and towels were fluffy and plentiful. The bathroom was lovely with a traditional cast iron bath with plenty of hot water and an EXCELLENT shower (I have a thing about hotel showers!!) all in all we were very happy and comfortable. On the down side (there isn't much), the decor is a little dated, but you're not in San Francisco to see hotel decor. There are NO tea/coffee making facilities in the room, so bring a travel kettle and supplies. The hotel advertises tea/coffee facilities in the lobby, however every time my boyfriend went for a coffee, there wasn't any, or worse it was always cold. Did not see any tea for the entire stay. The only other negative thing was the lack of air conditioning. Now coming from good old UK, we don't know the modern phenomenon of air conditioning, but I imagine that this could be a problem for some people. We were at the Baldwin in the last week of October 2007 and there was a bit of a heat wave. Temperatures were between 79 to 84F (26-28C) degrees everyday. We had the window open by day, but it gets very noisy outside due to the hotel's central location. It wasn't a problem for us, but I wouldn't advise staying here at the height of summer unless the hotel gets some air con. The staff greeted us very warmly and remained this way for the rest of the week, directing us to the post office, advising on trips, ordering cabs etc Our stay was room only so we had to forage for food everyday, but you will never go hungry or bored of food in San Francisco. We had sushi, Chinese, Italian, fish and so on and so on. Here are some of my favourite places to eat. 1. Cheesecake Factory top floor of Macy's. Very popular and touristy but well worth it. 2. North Beach Restaurant in Little Italy. So delicious, the best pasta outside of Rome. Quite expensive, but worth a treat. Brilliant traditional fine dining 3. Capps Corner. Americanised version of Italian cuisine. Generous portions, cheap and very very cheerful. 4. Mayflower Market. This is a little deli/mini-market on Bush street between Stockton Street and Grant Avenue (around the corner from the hotel) You can get all sorts here, fruit, bagels, sandwiches, crisps etc All to help you have that cheap breakfast/lunch. San Francisco is the most amazing city and there is so much to see and do. Highlights of the week were the visit to Alcatraz (pre-book online before you go) Golden Gate Bridge, Japanese Tea Gardens, San Francisco Zoo, Haight-Ashbury District, Pier 39, and Muir Woods. Although you'll find the most amazing and interesting things around every corner. If you haven't worked it out by now, I simply LOVE San Francisco and sincerely hope that I will go back one day.

We booked through an online service, pre-paid and took BART from San Francisco Airport, with a subway stop three blocks from the Baldwin. Check-in was quick and easy. Our room was on the 10th floor, with a queen-size bed and private bath. The room was small but very clean and the maid service every day was thorough. There were only two pillows on the bed but when we asked for two more they happily complied. I have read some complaints about the front desk but that was not our experience at all; they were always very friendly and helpful. The first night we stayed there it was hot but a ceiling fan kept it pretty comfortable. After that the temp. dropped and it was very comfortable. The elevator is slow but not so much as to be a problem. The location is excellent, right down the block from Chinatown; just beyond Chinatown is North Beach (a little Italy) and a bit farther Coit Tower (with another slow elevator that is worth the $5 charge to the top, where there are spectacular views). Union Square is also near, as is the cable car terminus down to Fisherman's Wharf. Trips to Alacatraz leave from Pier 33 but make a reservation - those trips fill up fast in the summer. The cable car trip is fun but there are long waits at the turn-arounds. We also took BART to the F line trolley to Fisherman's Wharf, which also worked well. There's also a Starbucks just up the block from the Baldwin. Checkout is at 11 a.m. and our plane did not leave until 5 p.m. However, they let us leave our bags at the front desk and we wandered around Chinatown for a few more hours. One depressing note: there are a lot of homeless in the general area, though we did not see any congregating at the Baldwin. Some are pretty aggressive demanding money though overall it is more than anything else a very sad testiment to our society's inability to make these folks' lives better than sleeping on the streets and begging.", "Date": "June 28, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "3", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "All Over The Silver State", "Title": "\u201cCozy\u201d", "Author": "NVRoaddog", "ReviewID": "UR16742040", "Content": "Cozy in every sense of the word.

Everything in our room was new: the carpet, linens, fabric, windows, tiles, furniture and paint with all the charm and quirks of a historic old hotel. I appreciate a hotel room where I can open the window. We stayed on the 9th floor and the water pressure was fine\u2014the shower had a low flow head, not much you can do about that.

So if you're traveling on a budget or simply don't feel like spending those dollars on a hotel room, by all means stay here. The Baldwin hotel is located at the Chinatown gate, so you're close to Chinatown (obviously), Union Square and the Market St. BART station (don't use Powell Street station if you're offended/bothered by beggars and the likes..the walk to and from Market St station, however, is perfectly ok). Walking to Fisherman's Wharf takes about 15 minutes. I stayed there for three nights in late March. The room was ok and actually more than I expected for under \u20ac50 a night. A bit like two to three star hotels in European capitals. The bathroom was large and everything was clean, which to me is the most important thing when it comes to hotel rooms. Staff was always nice and helpful.
