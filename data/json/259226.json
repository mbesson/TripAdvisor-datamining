I like drink or three so staying in a brewery seemed like a good idea. We booked via the hotels' own website with an email and decided to opt for an en suite room. We managed to find it using the street map we'd got and parked right outside the side door (you use one if you are coming or going outside opening hours) There aren't any lifts so just bear that in mind if you have a lots of / heavy luggage, there are a lot of stairs! The staff were very helpful both with checking in / out and with advice on the airport, places to visit etc... the bar staff and waiting staff were also friendly and polite. We had room 201 which has a partial view of the Harbour Bridge and is opposite the reception / office room. The location of the hotel means that there is some street noise, we found we had some unexpected early morning wake up calls but it wasn't a problem to drift back off to sleep. Our room was a good size and looked as though it may be used for meetings as it had some office type equipment and a really big table and chairs in there. The bed was very comfy and the bathroom had nice toiletries and a grooming kit. Shower pressure was good and hot water available all day. Breakfast was served in a separate room, lovely and light with nice flowers. Its a continental breakfast with a fruit plate, we found that its was plenty big enough to keep you going to lunch. Downstairs in the bar there is a great atmosphere, lovely beers and good food, what else can you want from your hotel? The bar was busy every night, a good sign, you need to time it right to get a table. We didn't get too much noise in the room however. Location is great, you can walk to the bridge in 10 mins and down to the harbour / Circular Quay in 10 mins (obviously depends how fit you are) so you are not far from any of the main sights and within easy reach of ferries to further flung places. You are also within reach of plenty of bars and restaurants. Its worth going into the smaller bars as some of big entertaining spaces out the back which are not always obvious from the front. Overall I think you get a better experience staying in a smaller place like Lord Nelson than you would do in a big hotel chain. Sydney is a big city and has a city vibe (for Oz standards anyway) but we were walking around at night and felt very safe. While we were in Sydney we went to the Aquarium which was good, took the ferry over to Manly which has a lovely beach, took the bus to Bondi (nicer than I expected) you get the #333 bus from Circular Quay, buy a ticket from the booth outside MacDonalds.

If you're worried about any noise from the pub, it's not a concern.

Rates in general were very expensive to stay in the Rocks/Circular Quay/Darling Harbour areas. Being a couple in our 20s we were trying to do our best to make the most out of our trip. Luckily we came across the Lord Nelson Brewery Hotel. Making the reservation was a little unusual because it was done over email, but we didn't let that deter us. Our flight from New Zealand was a very early one and we arrived at the hotel at about 10 in the morning. Unfortunately our room wasn't available, but they were able to hold our bag for us until check-in time. On our way from Christchurch to Sydney the airline lost one of our bags. Apparently it didn't make the ride with us on the mostly empty plane. Just as a side note Jetstar is fine if you don't have any issues, but their customer service is almost non-existent. But for the hotels part they were absolutely fabulous. The staff was friendly and very concerned about our lost bag and did everything that they could for us to help us out. The room that we had was very large and had a dining room table as part of the decor. Our room was the first one up the stairs and right across from the check-in room. As others have mentioned the stairs can be a little difficult, but we've carried our bags on subways in lots of cities so this was not that bad for us. The free breakfast was excellent and filling. On the day we left we were in a bit of a rush to go to the airport and they packed up our lunch for us. The pub gets a little noisy at night, but our room was nice and peaceful. I don't know if it was just our room, but we couldn't find the hair dryer. Not a big deal, but just a thing to note. I'd highly recommend this historic hotel to anybody!", "Date": "October 20, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Beijing", "Title": "\u201cTo be part of the history\u201d", "Author": "GuaguaBeijing", "ReviewID": "UR119238406", "Content": "We had double room on third floor of the hotel during our recent stay of 3 days in this hotel.

There is a side entry leading directly to the stairs, so no need to pass through the busy bar during evening hours. And once in our room, there is never noise from downstairs. We tried once the brasserie on first floor. The food was so good (fish and stead we've tried) and the house beer was fantastic. In one word, a wonderful stay in Sydney in this piece of history of the city. Apart from the circular guay which is just nearby, Sydney observatory is just 5 minutes walk away. We brought our daughter for the night stars observation tour, she enjoyed it so much. And the view from the hill was so nice. We forgot completely summer time change on the Sunday when we should leave.

The airport train will take you to the city in 15 minutes & Circular Quay station is the nearest to the Hotel. Its central location in The Rocks gives you easy access to many places of interest: Sydney Observatory; Harbour Bridge; Opera House; shopping district around George & Castlereagh Streets; St.James Church & St.Mary's Cathedral; Hyde Park; Sydney Tower ~ most of which are within 10-20 minutes' walking distance. Darlinghurst & Paddington are further afield but are easily reached via buses or CityRail services & the journey is usually under 30 minutes. Harbour Cruises as well as ferries to Cockatoo Island, Darling Harbour, Manly & Parramatta River all depart from Circular Quay, a quick 10 minutes' stroll from the Hotel. The Rocks is Sydney's oldest neighbourhood, it used to be a slum for the working class & gangs once roamed its mean streets. Happily, all that has changed & it is now a colourful, vibrant precinct well-loved for its historic atmosphere & heritage sites. ROOMS: We were in 2 different rooms during our 7-night stay, both were clean & comfortable. If you are a light sleeper or easily disturbed by noise, you may wish to request for a quieter room on the 3rd floor as those on the 2nd floor will expose you to traffic noise & the rowdy merry-making of weekend revellers @ the Bar downstairs. The spacious 1st room was on the 3rd floor and was furnished with a double bed, 2 bedside tables & lamps, TV with multi-channels, a single bed, chair, luggage rack, a tall slender wall mirror, wardrobe with hangers & extra blanket, a cupboard with iron (ironing board is hidden under the bed), fax machine, mini-fridge as well as tea & coffee-making facilities. The slightly smaller 2nd room was on the 2nd floor and was similarly furnished except that it only had a double bed, its cupboard was much smaller & there was no luggage rack nor fax machine. BEDS: The double beds were huge & comfortable with clean sheets & plenty of pillows. The beds were made daily & the bed linen changed regularly during our stay. BATHROOMS: The 3rd floor room has ensuite facilities. The attached bathroom was spacious, clean & equipped with all necessary amenities: ample towels & toiletries (hand soap, shower gel, shampoo, body lotion, shower cap, cotton-buds, even a mini sewing kit). There was hot water supply (essential during winter) & the shower head had fairly good water pressure. The 2nd floor room had no ensuite facilities but there was a communal bathroom on the floor that seemed to be shared between 2-3 rooms only. During our 1-week stay, we found the communal bathroom to be in a decent state @ most times except for a few occasions when it was rather wet & untidy with used towels strewn upon the floor & vanity counter... Not a major issue if you can tolerate a little mess now & then. Ample bath & hand towels were provided in the rooms & replenished with fresh ones as required. F&B: Room rate is inclusive of daily Continental Breakfast, a simple but adequate offering: 2 slices of toasted bread, jam & butter, assorted cereals, seasonal mixed fruits, juices and the usual milk, coffee & tea. You can pay a little extra (about $16 AUD) for a cooked breakfast that includes eggs, mushrooms, grilled tomatoes, baked beans & bacon. The Lord Nelson Hotel has a Brewery & Brasserie on its premises. Its award-winning natural ales are brewed on site & its Bar Menu offers the usual fare of meat pies, fish & chips, pizzas, salads & potato wedges. We had pizza & risotto for dinner on our 1st night here & found the pub grub rather delicious despite the chef being over-zealous on the black pepper... The Brasserie on the 1st floor is apparently renowned for its \u00e2\u20ac\u0153eclectic & innovative Australian cuisine\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd but we did not have the chance to dine here so unable to comment. SERVICE: Operating Hours for Reception/Front Office (on the 2nd floor) seemed to be from 9am-5pm. Rebecca, the lady who attended to us was both efficient & warm, always ready with a friendly smile & greeting. Check-In & Check-Out both proceeded smoothly. Check-In Time is 1pm but if you arrive earlier, you can leave your luggage @ Reception & do a spot of sightseeing around The Rocks while waiting for your room to be ready. If you happen to arrive after 5pm, you can get the Bar Staff to assist you with Check-In. Check-Out Time is 10am but they kindly allowed us to leave our luggage @ Reception for rest of the day as our departure flight was @ 8pm. Breakfast Room usually has 1 service staff on duty so you may need to wait a little while for your toasts & coffee/tea to arrive @ the table but cereals, milk & juices are available @ the self-service counter so you can start off with these 1st. The Breakfast Staff who served us during our 1-week stay were all helpful & obliging. SUMMARY: The LORD NELSON is \"Sydney's Oldest Licensed Hotel & also home to Australia's Oldest Pub Brewery\". When you choose to stay here, you can expect an unique experience in a historic property full of charm & character. There are only 9 rooms here so do make your reservation early to avoid disappointment. The room rates are admittedly quite steep (AUD $130 for a double room with shared bathroom & $190 for one with ensuite facilities); you can of course find cheaper accommodation elsewhere in Sydney but you'd be hard-pressed to find one that could offer you a similar slice of history served with such hospitality.", "Date": "August 6, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Melbourne, Australia", "Title": "\u201cGreat location, excellent room and great food!\u201d", "Author": "ShelleyinOz", "ReviewID": "UR115823136", "Content": "My partner and I stayed at the Lord Nelson Brewery Hotel for 3 nights in March, It is ia lovely historic hotel not huge but in a great location in The Rocks away from the main drag but an easy walk to everything, including Circular Quay.

The way it is run seems to make it obvious that it is a pub / brasserie which offers accommodation as a sideline, which means that as a \"hotel\" guest you do feel like an inconvenience at times. The 2nd floor reception seemed to be closed much of the time so you need to find someone from the bar to help you need anything - which isn't always easy when they're busy - and breakfast in the bistro was a particularly unrelaxed affair (but more about that later). The rooms themselves are perfectly nice but some are better than others - we had to move rooms during our stay so we did stay in rooms on both floors 2 and 3, which are quite different. The 2nd floor rooms are really lovely, large and with exposed stone walls and bags of character; the 3rd floor rooms are plainer, smaller & hotter, and the 3rd floor landing always seemed to have drying bedding draped over the stair rail, which was a bit offputting. It was breakfast that stuck in our minds the most though. Apart from the fact that it ends at 9.30 prompt (and you will be reminded if you dally), which is early if you're on holiday and that the coffee is limited to one small cup, the service was so hilariously inept and erratic that my husband and I started to take bets on when the waitress would turn up and what items she would offer and then forget to bring on any given day! Day 1 started out not too badly. The waitress didn't give us a menu or tell us what was available but asked us if we wanted fruit and toast so we said yes and sat down. Then she returned about 5 minutes later and asked if we wanted drinks so we asked for tea and coffee. The food arrived and was very nice indeed, but as she served she informed us that we'd have to leave soon because breakfast finished at 9.30 (this was only 9.15 and a fair number of people were still arriving). On day 2 she asked us did we want breakfast (well, we were in the dining room at breakfast-time so this was a bit of a no-brainer) so we said yes and she suggested toast so we said yes and she immediately ran off to get it - so my husband ran after her to ask if we could also have fruit. As she scampered off after bringing the food we asked if we could have drinks and she looked surprised by the request but kindly agreed that we could. The peanut butter then needed 3 reminders before it finally arrived. She did bring us someone else's toast just as we were leaving though. On day 3 she offered drinks just as we were sitting down so we said yes, expecting her to come back and take our breakfast order but she didn't. When she brought the drinks we asked if we could have some food and she looked around as if surprised that we didn't have any but nicely asked what we would like and brought it. Except she forgot the fruit. And the peanut butter. On day 4 she ignored us for 15 minutes until we asked her if we could have breakfast, which seemed to surprise her a bit. We ordered one portion of toast and 2 of fruit, at which point she again dashed off before we had a chance to ask about drinks. When she brought our 2(?) portions of toast we leapt in to ask about drinks and she kindly agreed we could have some. After about 10 minutes we ate our toast (and peanut butter) because it was cold but the drinks still hadn't arrived so we got up to find her to remind her. Eventually they came but to be honest we'd gone off the idea by then and it was nearly half past nine anyway so we had a quick sip and left. I think a pad and pencil might have helped her a bit - or even just a short script to follow - or maybe a menu she could hand out??? The young lady was very pleasant but a waitress she was not. And it wasn't only us, all of the other guests seemed to have the same experience - everyone spent the entire time with confused and frustrated expressions on their faces. Maybe they were trying to get a complete breakfast on the table before the 9.30 curfew!! Joking aside, this is a nice place to stay. The location is excellent and the staff (when you can find them) are very friendly and helpful.

The breakfasts, both the complimentary continental and those that can be ordered off teh menu, are good, and the dinners are aslo fine--although I prefer the \"pub grub\" served downstairs with the local regulars. The neighborhood is convenient to the tourist attractions of the Rocks and the Harbour Bridge, and it is a 2 minute walk to the bus stop and the connecting train to the airport.

Cons: - $190 AUD/night (for a room with an ensuite bath) seemed a bit steep considering that many of the big brand hotels in the area were priced in the $200-$250 range and come with full facilities (internet, concierge, etc).

The pub was historic, and the location was good, but unfortunately some of the particulars make me reluctant to recommend this hotel at $180/night. First off, the location in The Rocks is quite convenient, especially if you are, as we were, first time visitors to Australia. The first things we wanted to see in Sydney were the Harbour Bridge and the Opera House, so being in The Rocks was perfect. The neighbourhood is quite historic (if a bit rundown), and the decoration of the rooms was well-intentioned when it was first done (although unfortunately it has not been maintained; see below). The pub is popular, but we never heard any noise from it on the fourth floor. Whatever you do, if you stay in the hotel you should avoid room 403, which was our room. It was at the end of the hall, facing directly on the shaft in the middle of the hotel. All you could hear all night (and all day) was the vent fan in the kitchen going on and off -- it was very distracting during sleep. The fan is quite loud and runs most of the time, even in the middle of the night when the kitchen is closed. The room smells strongly of fireplace smoke, which is authentic but leaves you worrying that you and all your clothes reek of smoke. As mentioned above, the room was done in contemporary decor, with nice recessed lighting in the bathroom, nice tile, etc. But housekeeping hasn't been much for maintenance in the last 5 years or so. The lampshade on one of our lamps fell off the wire frame when we turned the bulb on. We left it on the floor for repair, but the maid the next day just balanced it back on the wire frame, where it fell off again immediately when we walked back into the room. The slats in the wooden shutters have fallen off so the shutters let light in early in the morning. Our king-sized bed had a duvet but no dust ruffle, so the bare box spring was exposed, which was unattractive. Also, our maid didn't seem to vacuum in the days we were there; there were a number of long, blonde hairs on the carpet when we arrived and they never moved, which was a bit gross. Other considerations: 1) The rooms on the fourth floor may all (like ours) have skylights. This is lovely during the day, but there's no cover for them, so sleeping in after sunrise is nearly impossible. 2) There's no lift, so you'll be hauling all your luggage up three narrow flights of stairs. 3) Service in general, like the maid service, is rather indifferent. One morning when we needed to leave quite early, we arrived at the dining room when breakfast was supposed to open. We could hear people in the kitchen, but the door was locked and they ignored our knocking. Thirty minutes later they chose to hear it, once there was a line of people waiting to get in. All in all, it's fine for a pub, but not worth $180. You can find a better room, even in Sydney, for $180.", "Date": "August 29, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "3", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "San Francisco", "Title": "\u201cLovely Lttle Hotel\u201d", "Author": "vagabondadelmundo", "ReviewID": "UR5714131", "Content": "We really enjoyed our stay in Sydney at The historic Lord Nelson.

It was a good start because this was everything we wanted from a hotel. I thought the price reasonable - we paid $180 per night. Continental breakfast was included (the usual fruit juice and cereal, then two huge doorstep pieces of toast and a skewer of mixed fresh fruit) or, for an extra charge, the chef was in attendance to cook breakfast. The location is fantastic (walking distance to the harbour). I was worried that being a pub, it would be noisy/smoky, but it was very quiet and my sensitive nose did not detect a whiff of smoke seeping up from below floors. Our room was on the 4th floor; ground floor is the pub, lst floor Brasserie and 3rd and 4th hotel rooms. Note there is no lift so tone those biceps for lugging your cases up the stairs. The room itself was small but had everything we needed and there was space to store the suitcases. The bed was huge and VERY comfortable, two huge, pretty bedside lamps, tv and although the window was tiny, there was a skylight so the room was light. Bathroom had a 3/4 bath with shower over; it was nice to have toiletries including body lotion. There was a fax machine and kettle stored in a cupboard and of course, the air conditioning was a must. We arrived first thing and our room wasn't ready but we checked in and were allowed to use a bathroom to freshen up. Our cases were left in the locked office until we returned in the afternoon. My husband tried the beer (his verdict, very good but a bit expensive) but to cap it all, there was the most fantastic fish restaurant (Fish at the Rocks) a hop, skip and jump away from the Lord Nelson where we had one of the best meals of our holiday. Best of all, they had a deal that if you were out by 19.45, two courses cost $40. It suited us find as we needed an early night after our flight. The fish was so fresh, thinking about it makes my mouth water! Anyway, would definately recommend the Lord Nelson.
