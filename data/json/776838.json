{"Reviews": [{"Content": "Nice and neat but hardly got any sleep! We stayed here for 4 nights choosing the location as we were visiting friends and family in the area. The rooms have been recently renovated and the decor is nice and clean, and staff were friendly.Unfortunately none of that helped us get any sleep! We were given a room away from the (very busy) main road which was great, however, we were kept awake by a flourescent light right outside the room which was so bright youy could read a book even with no lights on in the room. The curtain was nowhere near enough to block the light and te outside light stayed on until about half past midnight each night. Adding to this was a very squeaky door on the room next door and incredibly loud plumbing that roared anytime someone next door or upstairs took a shower. Why housekeeping staff don't report things such as squeaky doors is beyond me. Throw in one of the most uncomfortable beds we have ever slept in and not much sleep was had. There were no feedback forms in the room either so I can't see how any of these things will ever be fixed.", "Date": "Sep 2, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR348899085", "Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "2", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "3"}, "Author": "michaeljenandharry"}, {"Content": "Clean good value Appartments       Mastor Bedroom TV", "Date": "Aug 30, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR154456747", "Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "3"}, "Author": "pinan"}, {"Content": "Good Serviced Apartments Visiting Sydney for a soccer match, we stayed at the Comfort Inn Suites in Burwood to be near some friends.The motel is really out of the way. You would not stay here unless you needed to be near or in Burwood. But if Burwood is the place for you then it is an excellent choice.We booked a 2 bedroom room which was modern, clean, spacious. A fully functional kitchen, lounge, balcony were all great especially for 4 people. The master bedrooms had direct access to the balcony and also had a tv in the room. The second bedroom was a bit dreary. Only a very small window. It seemed to be a bit of an afterthought.We had limited contact with the staff but we did have an issue with the heating. It was impossible to get it to work. After calling and getting basic instructions (an in room demo would have been better) and trying every which way we got it to work about 10 minutes later.Overall I would definitely recommend staying here and did feel it provided good value for money.", "Date": "Aug 27, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR672554078", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "1"}, "Author": "Annannann"}, {"Content": "Don't stay here I would not recommend this hotel to anyone. After paying a fortune for a 2 bedroom apartment we expected at least for 4 people we have 2 adults and 2 children and there was only 1 double bed and a single bed and an extremely uncomfortable lounge. This was room advertised to sleep 6 people I have no idea where 6 people would fit in this room. Everywhere you looked they were charging money $5.00 to wash and dry clothes. If the smoke alarm goes off in your room you are charged $280 and there is a smoke alarm in the bathroom. The room was only serviced every 2nd day for the price we paid to stay here we would expect a room to be serviced daily. The kitchen was not much more than a sink and a oven that is placed in the corner of a room and so they get away with calling this a fully equipped kitchen but once again the signs saying if the smoke alarm goes off you are charged $280. So I would not recommend this hotel at all.", "Date": "Jul 13, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR486952804", "Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Business service": "1", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "2", "Overall": "1", "Value": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "2"}, "Author": "mjd1106"}, {"Content": "clean and convenient The hotel has recently been extensively renovated and was therefore beautifully clean and neat. It sits right on a fairly busy road but we managed to get a room at the back which was nice and quiet.Unfortunately, the place was so new that they hadn't quite managed to get enough irons and hairdryers for all of the rooms and you had to go to reception to get them...and watch them scramble around to find them. But they tried very hard and always got back to you within minutes.The beds were a little too firm and there were no spare pillows in the room, but it was still fairly comfortable. No mini-bar.There was plenty of parking underneath but it required 3-point turns to get around each bend, so be prepared.Overall, I would say that this is a very clean 3 star standard hotel that's convenient for a single night when you're not planning on spending too much time in the hotel.", "Date": "Jan 3, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR448398354", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "3", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "3"}, "Author": "FussyB00ts"}], "HotelInfo": {"HotelURL": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g255060-d776838-r19633295-Comfort_Inn_Suites_Burwood-Sydney_New_South_Wales.html", "HotelID": "776838", "Price": "Unkonwn"}}
