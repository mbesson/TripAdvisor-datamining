For a first time visitor, the Bauer Palazzo staff can make all the difference for a seamless experience. As it is unique, arrival in Venice can be tricky to negotiate. One doesn't just drive up to the Hotel Check In! The CONCIERGES at the Bauer all speak good English. We called the hotel for our reservations. As we were returning guests, we remembered our first experience driving into Venice. The confusing arrival can be eliminated with the help of the Concierge. They made the reservation for PARKING OUR CAR, as one gets off the Autostrada. A PORTER met us at the PARKING GARAGE and took our bags, for the not too short walk to the WATER TAXI STATION. Alternately, one can struggle to find parking in this very congested area, and just pray! There are also PUBLIC water taxis, if you feel you can schlep all your bags and load them on and off the crowded vapoetto. Fine if you travel light and don't mind the walk. The Bauer Palazzo is ON the Grand Canal. Location of your hotel makes a huge difference in Venice. It's a common sight to see tourists STRUGGLING with their bags over the cobblestones and many bridges, trying to get to their hotels in the city's interior. A porter to meet you is highly recommended. NO WORRY for this at the Bauer Palazzo!! I always feel like a princess when I arrive by the private water taxi to the hotels PRIVATE water taxi entrance! We prefer the Palazzo over the more modern Bauer, its sister hotel. The Palazzo is old Venetian splendor, with the most beautiful marble bathrooms you have ever seen. Rarely am I impressed with hotel bath amenities, but I love theirs so much I always buy some as gifts! The face and body cremes are locally made, the result of the Hotel's glamorous owner starting a program to help incarcerated women. Under the training of scientists, they create the most luxurious natural cremes! Always a big hit with friends and a wonderful contribution to the community. Our last stay was in a JR Suite, with a partial view of the Grand canal. The most beautiful view of all is for BREAKFAST, served at the HOTEL's ROOF RESTAURANT. The view will take your breath away, looking over all of Venice. The breakfast (included) menu is varied enough to not be boring over several days. We learned you can also get eggs, omelettes, etc to order. Typically we enjoy roof top breakfasts on the exterior patio, but this trip we were plagued with wasps! I wondered why there were no wasp traps in place as the insects were attracted to the fantastic fruit salad and pastry. The servers are very congenial and the cafe macchiato the best! For a great experience, tell the concierges that you want to have dinner where the locals eat-we enjoyed different neighborhoods, great food and of course, lower prices. Don't forget to have a Vino or a Choccolata on St Mark's Square while listening to the evening music under the stars-the Bauer Palazzo is perfectly located in the center of Venice.

If you are staying in the best, that's enough: you do not need everyone else to know! The foyer itself is small and like a jewel-box in deep,venetian colours, rich with silk and old chinese lacquer. The chinese flavour seems odd until you remember that Marco Polo was Venetian... We had a suite with a view of the Salute church that almost took your breath away and was as sumptuous (that word again but it's inescapable in connection with the Palazzo) with silk damask on the walls, glass chandeliers, more gilt and huge rococo mirrors to make the best of the light for which Venice is famous. On the bed was fresh linen everyday - not cotton, proper crisp, cool linen which is better even that the highest thread count cotton. After that, it was a treat every morning to press the button by the bed and have the blinds rise to give you a view that could fairly be the best in the world. As a guest of the Palazzo you have the huge benefit of breakfast on the roof terrace where the ladies are, as others have mentioned, superb - they have personality and character but with superb professionalism which starts off the day just right and then of course there's the view - again, the first time that you see it (I would say each day) it takes your breath away, but the same is also true on the terrace of the de Pisis restaurant on the canal and the side terrace for rinks too. I've stayed in several other of the famous Venetian hotels and I don't recall any of them having quite such an astonishing outlook. The food also lives up to the view, which is not something that you can take for granted, at all. All of this means that the experience of staying at the Palazzo is about as good as it gets in Venice but even that would not be enough if the staff did not live up to it: they do. There is a depth to the polish that exceeds even the highest expectations because they are not only superbly professional, they are also human - the service is carried out with a comfortable ease that, without any fanfare, makes everything right before you even knew what you wanted, even at the smallest level of summoning a lift. I must also mention the concierge team - they set standards of helpfulness and anticipating the questions that you would ask if you know what you wanted to know, which spoils you for anywhere else. And as for Paolo di Vacri, the Head Concierge, on his own he could have justified the reputation that Concierges have for being able to organise anything at all - he could and did and from achieving the impossible with which I was already delighted, within a couple of hours, he had improved even on that. You might had guessed that I and my partner had a wonderful time here.

From what I could gather they were: The Bauer had an impressive reception area compared with the Palazzo's rather pokey little room. The Bauer is accessed via a main square whereas the Palazzo is accessed by a narrow alleyway full of cooking smells. The Bauer doesn't have any rooms with Grande Canal views whereas the Palazzo's rooms generally do.\u00c2\u00a0 The Bauer guests take their breakfast at the canal side in the De Pisis restaurant whereas the Palazzo guests take theirs on a roof terrace.\u00c2\u00a0 The route from reception to the room at the Palazzo is tortuous in the extreme and you have to go via reception because the room keys are so large you wouldn't want to carry them around with you. What's wrong with key cards guys? The Bauer is cheaper.\u00c2\u00a0 At E 1,500 per night minimum for a Grande Canal suite you'd expect something pretty good and the Il Palazzo is very good. No point in me going on about all the great things - they are a given at these prices but what about the downsides? The first thing that hits you when you alight your water taxi is the huge uPVC front door. Hmmmm. Someone needs shooting for that I'd say! The checkin process wasn't the best. We were asked to wait in a room off the rather small dark reception area for what we thought was going to be 5 minutes. \u00c2\u00a0We got talking to a lovely South African couple who told us that they'd already waited 2 hours. I went to see the receptionist who confirmed that the room wasn't going to be ready for another 2/3 hours. What the heck did they expect us to do? Stare into the blank wall for 3 hours with our South African buddies?\u00c2\u00a0 We went for a nice lunch instead but this should just not happen in any establishment never mind one so expensive. First impressions count guys! We had a lovely suite with a view of the Grande Canal. We stayed for 7 nights and I would seriously question the value of the view for such a long stay. After 3 nights we'd taken it for granted! The suite was a little tired. There was an old fashioned TV in the lounge (how ridiculously cheap are LCD TVs these days?) and the LCD in the bedroom had a poor picture. The Satellite channels were the usual BBC World / CNN rubbish and there were no movies or pay TV. E 1,500 a night guys. Come on, you can really do better than this. The word Cheap springs to mind.\u00c2\u00a0 Sticking with the cheap theme the safe had a KEY! What's wrong with changing them up for a combination? Being tight and cheap again methinks.\u00c2\u00a0 The closets are a bit dark, there are no bedside cabinets, only tables and the mini bar didn't have any still wine. I seriously think the owner needs to stay in each room and see what's missing in practice and then spend some cash on sorting it out.\u00c2\u00a0 Really good points? The breakfast ladies are superb and the breakfast itself is very good. The WIFI is either free or very cheap depending upon how lucky you are.\u00c2\u00a0 Would I come back?

As we had advised in advance that this was our honeymoon, the manager kindly upgraded us to a suite, with a lounge area, large bedroom, impressive marble bathroom, walk in wardrobe and little balcony overlooking the Grand Canal - so lovely to wake each morning to the sound of the gondaliers singing! The hotel is made up of several buildings, and so finding your room can seem like a bit of a challenge, but take the time to enjoy the architechture and the old and new interiors and it becomes an adventure. The rooms are seriously impressive - silk wallpaper and wonderfully comfortable beds, you'd be forgiven for thinking you'd arrived a weary traveller and woken the next morning as part of a wealthy family in Titan times. If Venice is sinking, it may be because of the enormous amounts of marble used in the bathrooms! A spacious room with large bath and seperate equally large shower, 2 sinks and a selection of handmade local toiletries. Breakfast is also excellent - a good selection of hot and cold choices at a regulary replenished buffet, with waitress service for coffee. The terrace can be windy, and the pidgeons quite bold if you leave your plate, but it's well worth it for the panoramic view across the canal and the city. Tips & places to go: The hotel concierge, while very helpful, seem to be very fond of the top-price restaurants. Venice is very expensive to eat out anyway (\u00e2\u201a\u00ac25 for a coffe in Piazza San Marco, I kid you not), but more often you can walk away from the main tourist areas and find an excellent meal for a much more reasonable price. Look for places that are busy, then check the menu outside for prices. Take a good guide book (we used Lonley Planet and EyeWitness) and you'll find plenty of good places in the many hidden streets. Rosa Rosso is excellent for Venetian pizza! Get up early and head for the Rialto food market - an impressive display of fruit and veg, and a large fish market. You really need to get there early to see it as shopkeepers will have bough everything by 8am, but it's worth the early rise, and there's always plenty of cafes for a quick espresso to keep you going. Everywhere in Venice is crowded, so an early rise to see the sights at their least populated is a must, as is a walking tour - you'll see places you'd never have found. If you're looking for a massage, make sure you go to the sister location, not the one attached to the gym on the top floor of the hotel - it's expensive and my masseur was obviously also the gym manager, so stopped twice to answer the phone and a knock at the door during my massage - not very relaxing!", "Date": "September 20, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Location": "3", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Service": "2", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Brentwood, Tennessee", "Title": "\u201cNot anywhere close to expectation\u201d", "Author": "MTCinTN", "ReviewID": "UR118114760", "Content": "We were visiting friends in Venice and this hotel was highly recommended by Trip Advisor and other usually credible sources.

We did receive shockingly bad service at the spa (which is located at another Bauer property right across the Canal), and we'd recommend against using it, but that issue was mostly offset by the fact that the general manager of the Venice Bauers called me a few days later in Rome to apologize and provide an accommodation on the spa charge.

The room (746) was on the 7th floor and had a lovely large terrace which views over the Grand Canal and the busy street behind the hotel with all the lovely designer shops on. The room it self was a little tired but I think Venetian style in general is! The bathroom was lovely, all marble with a seperate shower and bath and nice big mirrors, essential for a lady!! My only fault about this hotel is some of the staff just did not seem to care. On the day we arrived I wanted to have a glass of Prosecco sitting next to the Grand Canal. We sat and waited to be served, only after my boyfriend asked 3 times could someone take our order did we eventaully get a drink. The De Pisis restaurant is also extremely expensive and neither I or my bf enjoyed our meals. I actaully could not eat mine it was so bad. When the waiter came to take my plate away (still full) he did not ask why I hadn't eaten my meal. They did however, not charge for any of our drinks, so maybe this was the reason. The concierge and all the team on reception including Paulo could not do enough for you and if you are going to stay in Venice for the first time as pricey as the Palazzo is I think it's a must to stay here or Gritti Palace or Westin Regina. I didn't like the look of the Danieli or any of the other hotels further on from St Marks Square (far too busy an area to stay in). Our hotel room was lovely and quiet if a bit of a treck to get to.

Overall, you get what you expect to get at a high-end Venetian hotel: classic decor, impeccable service, a bit of refurbishment needed here and there...all at a very high price. Venice in general is one of the most expensive places on earth, so a high-end hotel in Venice will naturally cost you dearly. Location/Ambience: Perfect. 5 minutes from San Marco. Across the canal from Guggenheim. Right next to most of the boutique shops in Venice. Also you get the classic \"checking into a hotel in Venice\" experience, which is you see the hotel as you slowly approach by boat, and step right off the boat into the hotel lobby. At some places (notably Danieli), I don't think you can do this. Il Palazzo is however adjoined to the larger and younger sister property Hotel Bauer (the two properties share elevators). The ambience is exactly what you would expect - wife squealed with delight when she saw the hotel for first time as we were approaching by boat, and you would half expect to see 007 sipping martini in a white tux in the hotel outdoor lounge area. The common area done with a classic Chinese motif. Room: Classic decor, actually so classic that it seems frozen in time (for example, the toilet seat was made of wood). Dim lighting, carpted floor, huge bed which you can melt into, and surprisingly spacious, especially the bathroom. Combination of age and constant presence of moisture result in a distinct smell, not just in our room but in all common areas as well. Not unbearable, but not too pleasant either. The main problem was the view - we had a good view of the alley below and the building next door, but no view of the canal. It was too late to do anything about it, but I would have paid extra for a canal view room. Food/Drinks: We ate out all the time, so cannot comment. But the hotel restaurant and lounge have one of the best views in the city. One thing to note that the famed B Bar at the hotel is undergoing renovation, so unavailable for a few months. Service: Friendly and formal. Restaurant recommendations spot on - all three dinners qualify as meals of a lifetime for us (they better be, since they cost about EUR350 each). Miscellaneous: This hotel is perfect for shopping. Everything within 2 minutes walk. Also a gondola station right next door, so very convenient if you simply must ride in one of those nasty eyesores. However if you are in town for the Venice Biennale (which we were), then hotel a bit out of the way (good 20-25 minute walk to the main exhibition halls). Conclusion is that we got exactly what we paid for and expected, and this hotel is definitely one of those \"love it or hate it\" places. If you are the type to take things in good humor, take pleasure in the fact that you're staying in a classic Venetian palazzo , and such pleasure outweighs everything else, then this place is perfect.

Concierge had not bothered to actually tell the staff (who don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t come in most days). The hot tub and steam room advertised on the web site are turned off to save energy. Forget the advertised reflexology (It doesn't exist), but the full massage was great. Concierge also managed to distinguish himself by telling us that the opera house was completely closed \u00e2\u20ac\u201c but did recommend an alternative. We went to the alternative, but next day saw that the opera house was open and an opera playing. Commission never came to mind\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 And finally \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the restaurant. Avoid this like the plague. Again, this was booked weeks in advance, but they had no knowledge of our reservation. The food was amazingly bland and completely devoid of any kind of passion. I almost fell asleep during my first course and sent it back. The waiter merely smiled as if it happened all the time. The chef refused to come out and defend himself, but given his poor effort, I can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t really blame him. The next day the manager did make the effort to come and talk to us. On the up side, the second room was great, the location is fantastic and the breakfast is fabulous. Most of the staff are very pleasant, but I just get the impression that they have lost the plot.", "Date": "February 8, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "UK", "Title": "\u201cI am totally unsure about this hotel\u201d", "Author": "paulhun", "ReviewID": "UR6588277", "Content": "Having just returned home after a 3 night stay at the Bauer Il Palazzo, my husband and myself are rather confused. This hotel adjoins its sister hotel, The Bauer (rated 5 star), whilst the Il Palazzo is rated 5 star luxury. The only difference is that when you arrive at the hotel, depending on which one you are booked into, you either arrive at a private landing dock on the Grand Canal for the Il Palazzo, or you arrive in the San Moise canal for the Bauer. Of course there is a huge increase in the room rates for the Il Palazzo. For the cost of our rather unimpressive dingly room in the Il Palazzo, we could have had a superior suite in the Bauer!! The Bauer has a very grand and impressive foyer, whilst the supposedly grander Il Palazo has a very dark, and unimpressive entrance with worn wooden reception desk and nowhere for guests to sit whilst the check-in clerk talks on the telephone and leaves you standing there, wondering if you are in the right place. Once you have checked in, you are shown to your room by a rther more helpful receptionist, but the room (620) was not up to the standard of a 5 star luxury hotel. For reasons listed: 1. there were no complimentary slippers to go with the bath robe (however the Bauer guests do get the slippers and the robe)! 2. No complimentary fruit basket 3. No complimentary mineral water (this had to be purchased for *\u00e2\u201a\u00ac8 from the minibar). 4. No complimentary newspapers. All restaurants (De Pisis and Canal Bar) were shared by both the Bauer and Il Palazzo. The breakfast rooftop room was also shared by both guests. In fact, there was absolutely no difference other than the over-inflated room rates for the Il Palazzo. So, back to our confusion, having checked the rooms on the hotel website for both hotels, we would undoubtedly not book for the Il Palazzo if we return to Venice. Why pay almost double room rates for absolutely nothing extra? We have stayed in many five star luxury hotels around the world, and we have to say that the Bauer Il Palazzo lacked those little extra luxuries that make the difference. The room was very small, drab in decor, the carpet needed a clean, and the staff seemed to use the room more than we did. One such chap just walked straight in (we were both in our robes), and he prompltly backed out again, rather embarrassed, but when my husband went after him to ask him what he wanted, he said \"nothing\"! So what was he coming into the room for? anyway, enough moaning, the stay in Venice, in early January, was magical, the hotel is perfectly situated (both hotels!) for all of the good shops, and sights. It really is only a 2 minute walk to San Marco Square. If you are thinking of staying at either of these hotels, I would recommend that you choose the Bauer, and not pay the inflated Il Palazzo prices because the extra cost is completely unjustifiable in my humble opinion. If anyone who has stayed here can explain what the difference is, please do share!", "Date": "January 13, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "1", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Singapore, London and Ibiza", "Title": "\u201cGreat location in Venice\u201d", "Author": "Livingoutofasuitcase", "ReviewID": "UR6564283", "Content": "This is a great hotel in a great location however it is 'attached' to the rather more standard Bauer Hotel. Ensure you want to pay more money for that 'historic feel' before booking here or alternatively the Bauer offers the same location. The rooms are small (welcome to Venice!) but nicely decorated. Bathrooms are superb. The 7th floor breakfast room and terrace are wonderful only pity is they stand empty without any use for the rest of the day. They really should use the space as a tearoom or bar in the evenings - stunning views. Hotel is lacking a lounge or bar! The restaurant is overarted I believe. Food is not bad but far too 'handled'. Good produce should mean less fuss. Venice is full of great places to eat as long as you make sure the conciege (great service!) points you in the right direction.
