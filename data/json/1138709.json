I will stay again when I go back to Boston. If I was going for pleasure to see an event at The Garden, this again would be an excellent property. It is literally across the street from The Garden. The subway is within 1 block and Quincy Market is 2 stops away. This property is close to the downtown happenings so the location is excellent. Its a bit hard to find as the entrance is on a side street, but once you realize where you are going its fine. The staff were very friendly and helpful. The breakfast wasn't that good, I would say a bit below HIE standards but the lady running the breakfast was good at keeping the coffee hot and fresh. The room was clean but a bit on the smaller side. Again, this is East Coast traveling so you have to expect smaller rooms and less overall quality compared to the rest of the U.S. They had a nice business center- a bit small and the computers were a bit older- but it served its purpose. The only issue you may have with the business center is that it is in the basement and there is no staff monitoring the room. If I were, for example, a female traveler alone I might not feel so safe hanging out down in the room. The workout room was TINY but at least they had one. The workout room is across the hall from the business center and both have a glass wall. That means that anybody walking by can watch you working out and/or anybody in the business center can watch you working out. Not exactly the most ideal situation. They offered a $10 off-site workout option but I didn't take them up on the offer.", "Date": "March 13, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Derby, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cGreat location near to subway to explore city\u201d", "Author": "Glyn_Derby", "ReviewID": "UR125035292", "Content": "Stayed here for 4 nights during short city break.

The hotel is located directly across the street from North Station (north shore commuter rail & Amtrak from Maine & New Hampshire) and The Boston Garden (a sporting and event venue) which can be a plus or a minus depending on your needs! It is a very short walk to Faneuil Hall & Quincy Market, the North End, the Aquarium, the waterfront, and the subway or the north bound trains to take you anywhere else you think you might want to visit. While the easy access location has it's plusses, it also has minuses! Being directly across the street from the Garden means that it can be quiet busy and noisy if there are events going on. Depending up on the event and the time of day, sleep can DEFINITELY be interrupted. Add to that, is the fact that there are several bars located with in a door or two of the hotel. I suggest making sure to pack earplugs if you are a light sleeper or are bothered by boisterous noise. The lobby is open and bright and the front desk staff courteous and proficient. Even though the hotel has recently been \"refubished\" and opened as a Holiday Inn Express, it already has a rather \"tired\" feel to the elevators, hallways and rooms. BUT, at often less than 1/2 the price of other downtown hotels, a little nick and/or wear on the furniture is something that I can deal with. The rooms are clean and during my 5 or 6 separate stays, I have not had anything to complain about. Guests need to be aware ahead of time of the potential location noise and the fact that this is NOT a 4 or 5 star property.

We stayed 3 weeknights and didn't have the noise problems from the other reviews, so maybe it's worse on the weekends. We were on the 4th floor facing TD Garden and did hear some traffic noise/ sirens etc. They were doing road construction with jack hammers, but didn't notice until we walked outside. Check in was fast and they were great about holding a package at the front desk before our arrival. The room had high ceilings, a bath, and a kitchenette, but no sofa bed or walk in closet like some other rooms. The kitchenette didn't have much in the way of dishes or cutlery except for some disposable dishes. The overall design of the room and bathroom was ok, but nothing extraordinary. There was also some sort of lingering onion like odor, so we opened the windows to air out the room. The elevator could use a lick of paint and was missing a mirror. Felt more like a service elevator actually and was a bit slow. The complimentary breakfast had scrambled eggs, crispy bacon, and sausages along with toast, bagels, fruit, cereal and a pancake machine. Not much daily variety though and three days was enough. We also received free wi-fi as Priority Club elite members which worked fine when the log-in screen would show up. Had to manually type in the url on my iPad sometimes. The location was ok for us first time visitors and we walked pretty much everywhere and took the T if we were too tired to get back.

The corner rooms are the biggest. Cons from our stay: 1. Noise from the street 2. Although refurbished, some things are still old or require maintenance (we've had a problem with the toilet and the air conditioning wasn't too useful). Pros: 1. Location is very good: 2 minutes walk to T's north station, walking distance to downtown locations 2. Staff - are trying to make your stay as comfortable as possible. The staff responded to our requests quickly and in an efficient way. 3.

We had a walk-in closet, sofa-bed, flat screen TV, and a kitchenette with mini-fridge, microwave, sink and cupboards. It looks quite swank and thankfully was functional too. So many of the newly refurbed HIEs we've stayed in are all style and no substance; our room at this hotel really did serve us well. The hotel is conveniently located close to North Station and is just across the street from TD Garden, so there are plenty of buses, taxis and shuttles nearby. There are plenty of places that are walkable from the hotel: North End, Feneuil Hall, Quincy Market and a gigantic Whole Foods are all easy to get to on foot. In fact, Boston is a very walkable city in general and we walked everywhere from our hotel, including the Aquarium, Boston Common, Chinatown, Downtown, the Theatre District, Bunker Hill and the USS Constitution. We had bought seven-day travel passes for the subway and water taxis, but found we rarely needed to use them. Back to our room. One problem we had with the room was if we used the wall switch to turn on or off our lights, the alarm clock would also switch off because the socket it was plugged into fed off that main wall switch. That's bad design. Another issue we had when we first arrived was that our toilet was running constantly and wouldn't flush correctly. We rang the front desk and someone from maintenance came to repair the problem almost immediately. We had no further problems with it after that. There were a few downsides to staying at this hotel. Our room, with it's four large windows, got chilly and the thermostat wasn't very useful. A nice feature of the windows is that they can be opened a little bit to let in the fresh sea air, but keeping them open at night is impossible due to the number of bars blasting out pulsating, thumping music. And even if the music wasn't an issue, the number of drunken, yelling people staggering around in front of the hotel is definitely a problem. There is a pizza joint across the road that only seems to be open in the evenings to feed loud-mouth drunken women who have no idea how to keep their gobs shut. Even with the windows bolted shut, don't plan on sleeping until after the bars close and the taxis carry the wrecked, gobby women away. Or bring earplugs and hope for the best. Another issue we had with this hotel was the breakfast area. It is incredibly compact, and we noticed that guests with disabilities were pretty much left out because their wheelchairs or walkers couldn't fit the snug space. And then there was the morning that they ran out of several breakfast items and didn't bother to tell anyone until several guests raised their voices about it. Only then did one of the hotel staff wander over to the computer terminal and print out a sign stating they were out of eggs, bacon and pancake mix. For a hotel to run out of so many items at once seems like whomever handled inventory wasn't doing his or her job. Since they were out of so many items that morning I opted for cereal, which had to be discarded because it was beyond stale. Luckily Boston is full of Dunkin' Donuts. Hotel concierge weren't very helpful either. We overheard a group of elderly guests ask about a certain tour they wanted to go on, and the concierge kept trying to steer them toward another tour instead. Finally one of the group said, \"This is the tour we would like to book. Can you help or not?\" And the concierge said he could not. Later, we heard the concierge telling his co-worker that the group wanted a tour that he didn't get a kick-back from, so he wasn't going to help them out. Then they hi-fived. On our last morning in the hotel (we stayed seven days) the hot water in our room packed it in and we couldn't shower before our flight. We rang the front desk about it but no one answered. When we went downstairs to see someone in person, all the phones were ringing and two other groups were waiting to check out, and no one was around. One of the red-jacketed concierge was in the room, but he had his back to the front desk, surfing the internet. All in all, the hotel gets good marks for the room itself, which was comfortable and spacious, but it gets poor marks for just about everything else except its proximity to other attractions.", "Date": "November 1, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "2", "Sleep Quality": "2", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Austin, Texas", "Title": "\u201cIt's all about location, location, location.\u201d", "Author": "austinlightwriter", "ReviewID": "UR119351095", "Content": "As a platinum level member, I have stayed at literally hundreds of Holiday Inn Expresses.

The room, well, it's a standard one because that's all they had by the time i could get this booked two weeks before I left. (Through priority club so I only paid 40 dollars a night for five nights). The room is a pretty decent size, I wouldn't say huge or anything like that, but you got a fold out couch that is pretty old and leans in when you sit on it. The AC/HEAT is great, keeps both rooms well enough temperature controlled, but the bedroom should really have its own for the winter months. The bed is nothing special, and was kind of hard to sleep in comfortably for another person (if it's just you... GREAT!) The rooms walls are kind of thin, which kinda sucks when the room next door come back at two in the morning and lets the door slam shut (woke me up, both nights).

It was available at the time of booking (two days prior to arrival) 2. It is walking distance from MGH (Mass General Hospital) which I was doing business with. 3. It was well priced, as they have special MGH rates. Overall the hotel is just OK. The room is OK - not large but not very small. The bed is OK - not too comfy but not too bad either. Cleanliness is OK - not spotless clean, but not dirty, either. View - the gym across the street The room contains a small kitchenette - totally unneeded for me. It also has a small fridge, which is always nice. It has a nice full HD TV - perfect for playing those movies off your laptop (if you bring the right cables). The wifi worked OK - not very fast, not too sluggish. The breakfast is complimentary and also OK. Some muffins, waffles, coffee, cereal - you really don't need more than that. The fitness center is mediocre - a very small room with a not-really-working A/C, two treadmills, two bicycles, some dumbbells and a physio ball. You can pull off a workout, but that's pretty lame. The staff is OK - not too friendly, but not obnoxious either. The building is quite old, the elevator is lousy - gets stuck quite often. The location was good for me, since it was close to my colleagues' office at the MGH. However, this street is somewhat shabby - there are always homeless people at the end of the street and a loud and sleazy bar nearby. Besides that the location is fine. A few nice pubs and sports bars in the parallel streets. There is a 7 eleven and a CVS nearby. It is also a decent location for Boston sightseeing, and right across from the TD garden if you are attending an event over there.

I complained the first night and nothing happened. You could even tell by this group of guests' behavior in the lobby that this group was a problem.

But I eventually realized that they were just to moronic to be professional hockey players. On the 2nd night I confronted them myself, and of course they just threatened me in return. 4 against 1 was not a fair situation and I had no one on my side. I wondered how on earth none of the other guests on my floor were complaining about them. Of course, these idots were the last room on the floor and I was in the room right next to them with no one else on the other side of them. Still, they were all over the hallway causing problems.

The accommodation prices were crazy high and we had to settle for a $295 A NIGHT for The Hotel at Boston Garden which is in reality simply a Holiday Inn Express.

It is also just across a train station, the North Station, which is nice when you want to visit and use the very old subway.

The very quiet street has in fact many bars, clubs and sports bars. On the Saturday night, between 1:30 to 2:30 a.m., it was literally impossible to sleep since everybody was exiting the bars and having lots of fun discussing it on the street. There was no noise isolation at all... And alcohol being involved, it quickly became fights, people yelling at each other, calling names and using the F word... Classy... I know, you would say, it was a game night. Its probably not like that every night... Well, on the night before on Friday, the Bruins were not playing and we had even worst fights at 1:00 and 2:00 a.m. At one point, the fight was so intense, I thought we would hear gun shots...
