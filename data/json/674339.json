The rate is ~$140/night but the room we got looked like a couple of steps above a hostel. But I do feel the place is worth it because of the location, the free breakfast, the quiet neighborhood, and the nice bar attached to the hotel. Yes, I would recommend this place and stay here again.

I found this place after a bit of a Google search and it didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t look too bad so we thought we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d give it a try. Location wise, it was perfect for us. It was literally across the road from the museum and a 10 minute stroll into Darling Harbour. It wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t 4 star accommodation but it was clean, cheap (for Sydney), and was air conditioned. Our room (11) was in the Annex at the side of the hotel and faced onto the quieter side road and also had a small kitchenette. It also included breakfast pre delivered to the room consisting of bread for toast, juice, cereals and yoghurts. The pub itself was in the middle of a refurbishment and therefore in a bit of a mess but we weren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t there long enough for it to be an issue. Check- in time on the website says 12:00 noon and 1:00 pm on a sign in the room, but we still had to wait 15 minutes for our room to be ready when we arrived at 1:45 pm. We were happy to have a drink while we waited, but if we had arrived at 12:00 and had to wait an hour or two, I would have had something to say about it. Apart from soap, towels and a hairdryer there is nothing else supplied in the bathroom so make sure you take your own shampoo, shower gel etc. If you want somewhere in between a backpackers and a 4 star hotel within a short stroll of Darling Harbour, give it a try.", "Date": "February 20, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cLittle gem\u201d", "Author": "Muffinb21", "ReviewID": "UR123232365", "Content": "We decided to save a little and stay here so that we could spend a little extra in Sydney.

I also have a desire to eventually live in Pyrmont - I love the suburb, it's 5 minutes away from the CBD and has the cafe culture that I'm in love with. Being self-employed, I can stay wherever I want to for providing i have internet access - which I do through Telstra and my MacBook Pro. I've never stayed in a \"hotel\" before (as defined as being a pub with accommodation) and instead of using the internet, I simply drove down Harris Street. i saw the \"Glasgow Arms Hotel\", walked in to the hotel and within 5 minutes had the keys! The room was the equivalent of a 4 star hotel. Check-In was as simple as paying a night's accommodation and showing my passport. The locals are friendly and professional people. I loved the place so much (and the location) that a second night was mandatory. Drinks are cheap and breakfast is included - how is that for $130.00 a night 10 mins away from the CBD? It doesn't stop there - besides a slight odour, the room was immaculate. I stayed for under 48 hours and the room was cleaned at least three times. There was access to a balcony (keep it locked when you're not inside the room). There is a 7/11 across the road and numerous cafes and restaurants along Harris Street. One staff member who I'd like to personally thank is \"Joe\". His friendly nature and professionalism added a big difference to my stay. Thank you Joe! In conclusion - if you need somewhere to stay in Sydney on a budget I cannot recommend the Glasgow Arms Hotel enough!

We wanted somewhere cheap and close to Darling Harbour. This hotel met both criteria at under $A100 per night and only minutes walk to Darling Harbour and Paddys Market. The hotel is sited across the road from the Powerhouse Museum and the Ian Thorpe Aquatic centre, a short walk to Chinatown, and the hub of Darling Harbour. It is also about 15 minutes walk to Central Railway station. As a small hotel it does not have a \"reception\" area but this function is done at the bar and thus if arriving outside normal bar opening hours it is necessary to make arrangements before hand. Normal check in is 1.00pm and we arrived at 9.00am having checked earlier that our room would be ready early. We stayed in Room 10 which is in an annex to the hotel with its own entrance. There are four rooms in the annex. Our room had its own balcony complete with chair and two tables. The room was not large having a double bed more than adequate storage a bathroom containing toilet, washbasin and large shower with great hotwater pressure. A hairdryer was in the bathroom. The room was airconditioned with a reverse cycle heat pump. Whilst dated in design and decor the room was very clean and well maintained for each day of our stay( Which incidently was 5 days). Breakfast comes as part of the taffif and each evening a continenal breakfast comprising cereal, toast , juice and jams were delivered to our room and placed in the fridge. Tea and coffee making facilities are also standard. Whilst basic the amount of food provided was a great way to start the day. The hotel is sited on the corner of busy through roads and with the door to the balcony open it is very disruptive but closed the noise whilst discernable was not an issue. The road traffic died away in the evenings and on weekends. The hotel also has its own brasserie restaurant which we used several times during our stay. The food was good, plentiful and very good value for money. The staff were very friendly and helpful during our stay and I would stay there again.", "Date": "October 14, 2008"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Glasgow Arms Hotel", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g255060-d674339-Reviews-Glasgow_Arms_Hotel-Sydney_New_South_Wales.html", "Price": "$124 - $140*", "Address": "<address class=\"addressReset\"><span rel=\"v:address\"><span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">527 Harris St.</span> | <span class=\"extended-address\">Ultimo</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:locality\">Sydney</span>, <span property=\"v:region\">New South Wales</span> <span property=\"v:postal-code\">NSW 2007</span></span>, <span class=\"country-name\" property=\"v:country-name\">Australia</span> </span></span></address>", "HotelID": "674339", "ImgURL": ""}}
