There were several thoughtful but not intrusive gestures, including a bottle of wine to mark my wife's birthday, and the management were always friendly and helpful. We paid 150 euros for a twin, en suite room which by expensive Barcelona standards seems good value. The location is excellent: very central but not too busy or noisy, and close to buses and metro. We walked there, the few blocks from the Estacion de Nord where the coach from Girona airport arrives. The breakfast-included is fine: juice, coffee/tea and croissant and toast. A carafe of drinking water is provided along with a notice to say that the tap water is not reccommended. Additional jugs of water cost 2 euros and I thought that was disappointing and that a fresh jug could be given each day of one's stay.

Next, there are signs saying not to drink the water from the taps. There is one small flask provided, and after that, it can be supplied at over 2 euros a flask. What a rip off! The water in Barcelona is high quality, and you can buy 1.5L of water for 50 euro cents. The only way to get tea or coffee is to order it, and it does come beautifully presented. However, as the desk is not manned 24/7, you can't get tea or coffee when you want and on some occasions in March, there was no-one there between 5.30pm and 7am. so no late nght or early morning tea. As well, the plumbing is suspect. My sink blocked up and was still that way in the morning, so I had to change rooms. I noticed some people like the breakfast. I was not impressed. I stayed in a monastery a week earlier and had fantastic food. What is provided here, is not great. I had pre paid, but decided to find my own after the first morning. For 10 euros, I got lukewarm coffee, cold white toast, a bit of sponge cake, half dried mandarins and strawberries, etc. The internet conection was never strong and very intermittant.

It was not large by any means but had what I needed and the antique furnishings were lovely. The terrace was beautiful and a lovely place to sit and unwind. Staff were wonderfully helpful in all regards. My room included breakfast, which is brought to you on the terrace at the time you choose. It was an enormous breakfast - fruit, yogurt, granola, toast, croissant, cake, ham, cheese, oj and coffee. I ended up making ham and cheese sandwiches for later in the day - and then finding a place to eat my dinner in the late evening on La Rambla. So my food costs were very low - as my dinner often ended up being helado (ice cream) , or meringues filled with almonds.... you only live once. One thing I should say is that if you have loud neighbors - and I did have loud neighbors, you will hear them. The terrace is supposed to close at 10 pm and my neighbors didn't respect this, they sat out with friends drinking and talking til midnight or later. So my suggestion to management would be to kindly and firmly remind people to quit the terrace at 10 when they check in. My ipod and earphones came in handy but just remember - this is an old building, it does not have modern soundproofing, and if you are very sensitive to noise it may not be for you.

Subsequent to my visit and given some time to mull it over, my opinion of the hostel (do not consider this a hotel) has changed or at least become more balanced. We booked here at the last minute for the GSMA MWC event in Barcelona. Despite the high prices of surrounding hotels and it's central location, the hostel L Antic Espai offered us a very reasonable rate and two rooms. I arrived and chose the single room, room 110. The initial welcome was warm and friendly, and the two staff members we met during our stay, remained as warm and welcoming throughout the period. The room was an unpleasant surprise, tiny with a heavy musty smell that turned out to come from a tiny hidden location behind the only door/window. This little hidden square was where the building's water tanks were located, an internal location that offered anything but fresh air. No other windows exist to the outside, so the room filled with this stuffy smell. Finger printing allowed us free access through the doors 24 hours a day and the location was very central, minutes away from the main plaza de Catalunya and both the Red and Green lines on the Underground. My room's condition and the sense of feeling cheated continued until the very last morning when I finally ate breakfast at the hostel. The little outdoor veranda where breakfast is served blunted that disappointment a little and together with the helpfulness of the two staff members, raised my view of this place somewhat. What it is not is a business hotel, with the wireless down 75% of the time we stayed there (5 nights) and no lobby as in a traditional hotel lobby for a meeting area. If you're traveling on a tight budget, this must be your number one place to consider.

This hostal (originally was likely a very large flat/apartment that has been divided into several rooms with private shower, sink and toilet). The rooms designed for singles are small and the doubles range in size but are very nice. The patio off of three back rooms is nice but you can hear the school kids right next door. If you are in the back rooms you will feel the rumble of the subway that isn't that far away with a stop about the same distance as the airport bus stop. The one way taxi rate was approximately 12.5 euros. There are plenty of restaurants, walking boulevards, and parks within easy walking distance. The very nice airport bus (5.30 euros per person) is an easy 10 minute walk. The hostal is on the second story of the building and you have a series of stairs to navigate entering and leaving the hotel. There isn't an elevator to assist potential guests that have difficulties with stairs. If you have a day to spend outside the city, I highly recommend taking the R11 from the Barcelona Garcia train station (which is across the street from two Gaudi houses) to Figueres (1.5 hours each way and approximately 28.5 euros each way) to visit the exceptional Dali Museum and adjoining jewelry gallery. Check out the Dali beating heart on the internet just to get a taste of this amazingly gifted and talented artist.

Abel and Sergio were really friendly and gave us many useful tips (thank you for that, guys!) One should definitely follow their advice and try Cuidad Condal, a tapas-bar two block away from the hotel. The place is always crowded at night, but is not so obviously touristic. You might wait for a table for a while or try to get a place at \"bar area\", actually, in front of glass case with all those delicious tapases and fresh seafood. You can order anything by simply pointing the piece you like the most to the barman (and don't even try to figure out how it's called in Spanish or Catalana), while he easily pours your glass with wine, reasonable priced, by the way.

We had our fingerprints taken, our ID cards numbers copied and our Visa cards swiped. The information provided was complete, helpful and comforting. Our salute goes out to the hotel owners for decorating the hotel the way they did. When claiming to have an antique theme hotel, one should be pretty self-assured. Our expectations in this respect were met. Every detail of the hotel accomodation complied with the theme without ever making the guests feel dusty. The total experience was gay and pleaseant. The rooms were clean and the supplies were satisfactory. However, the room airconditioning didn't seem to be able to cope with the hot weather outside, even though the latter can hardly be considered exceptional. Although a lovely hair dryer was put at my disposition in the single room, it failed to accomplish its single task. Honesty dictates to add that my friends in the double room had a different experience. For me, this is not much of a consolation, as I get really anal about my hair. At night, the single room proved to be decent. The double room however appeared to be above a subway line. This is acceptable per se, unless a subway actually runs through it. The hotel is located in the heart of Barcelona, which is practical and rather exceptional for a hotel in this price range. Although Sergio tried his best to advise us on where to go, we couldn't help but notice his taste being rather clich\u00e9. Upon asking where to buy jamon iberico, he sent us to el corte ingl\u00e8s while we expected a somewhat more local and authentic delicatessee store. He did however advise us a cocktailbar that was more than satisfactory. The continental breakfast was a bit disappointing. The croissants and the pain au chocolat gave a rather industrial impression and were not crispy at all. Indeed, everything on the table was compliant with the antique theme, including the baked goods. After embarking upon a discovery trip in the city, ones legs tend to be rather exhausted.

The location is great, just a few blocks from Las Ramblas, within easy walking distance of Sagrada Familia and many other attractions, and relatively easy to find, even in a large city like Barcelona. Now for the bad news. The hotel was way too over-decorated. This isn't just a matter of personal taste - we found that it was so cluttered that it was difficult to find room for our own stuff. At first it was quaint, but then it just became irritating. Toiletries were not replaced. Several of our bath towels had holes in them. Cleanliness of the floors was not great - we ran our foot towel over the floor in the bathroom after a shower, and it came up dirty. The bathroom is too small for any of your own toiletries (ie shaver, makeup) to be stored. We had a room that adjoined the outside terrace. That was ok as long as your neighbours were quiet when they used it, but that wasn't always the case and several times we were awoken by groups having an early breakfast on the terrace. If the neighbours don't wake you up, then the birds in the cages likely will. I love birds, and don't mind waking up to bird song, but one of the caged birds had a metallic screech that sounded like some of the toys that the street vendors on Las Ramblas were hawking.

All of the furniture was from the distant past, but not a bad thing. It is probably romantic in a couples sort of way. Breakfast was included in room, I opted for coffee, juice and bread. Lovely.

Instead of generic soaps, what they give you are these precious little bottles of goodies and even perfumed water! A very nice touch! You can really feel that the owners want everything to be perfect and for you to feel at home!

Really it is a 5 star B&B. What were called \"Pensiones\" used to abound in Spanish cities, and generally occupied one or two floors in a large city centre building. Often you could come across two or 3 pensiones in one building. L'Antic Espai has 9 or 10 rooms occupying half the First Floor of an enormous c1900 building in a superb location on the Gran Via within a few minutes walk of the Plaza de Catalunya, and offers B&B services (no staff after 21h00). They like to know what time you are arriving to ensure that someone will be there to let you in. You enter through carved hardwood doors around 4-5 metres high and the interior is almost indescribable.....a veritable jungle of baroque and Catalan modernist furniture with more nick-nacks than a Victorian parlour . You have to be careful going down the narrow corridors with your suitcase, as you could easily knock over an ornament or picture; you look up from your breakfast to find yourself staring into the eyes of a collection of porcelain dolls! The bedrooms are amazing as well, only slightly less cluttered than the public area, but featuring 3 metre high wardrobes, loopy lamps with glass rose petal shades operated by porcelain \"clock\" switches last seen in provincial France circa 1937 and German telephones from the same era. Magnificent! Four of the bedrooms give onto a shared terrace with chairs and tables (for breakfast), a profusion of plants and three Victorian porcelain and wire birdcages, each populated by finches and budgerigars. The one drawback is the floor to ceiling sliding doors between the rooms and the terrace affording a clear view into each room; emerging naked from the bathroom is not recommended! Breakfast is included (nothing special but quite adequate) and can be served on the terrace or in the Salon amid the collections. This place is so unusual that I brought two colleagues to see it (they were staying in an extremely bland \"corporate\" hotel)...they could not believe it! L'Antic Espai offers very good value for money, if the website packages (some room rates continue the eccentric theme by including Ayuvedic massage) do not appeal, a phone call to the hotel secured for me very favourable rates.

In most other hotels the cleaning personal has a certain time frame often not more then a couple of hours when it comes to cleaning a room. But here the cleaning personal could be available from early morning to late in the afternoon! This was incredible! Another thing is that you simply could talk to the hotel manager or the cleaning personal and tell then at what time you wish to have your room cleaned at. Also another great thing is that they ask when YOU would like to eat your breakfast!

We walked up the first flight and luckily a women coming down told us that we have to buzz the only door on that first landing. Inside was a small reception desk and narrow corridors leading to the rooms. To say the place was packed with antiques is an understatement. One could hardly move for all the antiques. Our room had high ceilings, and was fairly large. The bathroom was modern and clean. We had a balcony. There were potted plants and antiques even on the balcony. The 2 men that run it live next door and were very friendly and helpful. They spoke English, made strong coffee and toast for breakfast and provided us with free internet. The location was close to Las Ramblas so it was great. The only complaint my husband had was that the bed was hard. It was a very unusual place to stay and memorable for sure. If you are tired of generic hotels, and better still, like antiques, this is the place for you. If you don't care for a different experience with funky vibes, don't go.

The hotel is on the first floor of a beautiful old building and once inside, you are met with an array of antique furnishings and decorative figures (baroque style), which extend throughout the hotel, which is all on one level.

There are lots of little touches e.g. 'proper' hairdryer, fluffy white bathrobes, breakfast and drinks served in sympathetic crockery/glasses etc. (The doileys are indeed gorgeous). We stayed in 107, which lets out through a separate private sitting room to a shared terrace (with Patio Heater), where breakfast was served (well worth upgrading breakfast for 3 euro) and where you can have drinks or just relax by candlelight.

You access the hotel through gorgeous, large ornate wooden doors. They get your fingerprint, and that becomes your key. Its a great mixture of old world charm & new technology! Then it\u2019s up a couple flights of stairs, and there is a small lobby area. There are several private rooms, all with their own bathrooms, and all decorated beautifully & differently. We were traveling with our 2 teenage daughters, who also loved both guys & the hotel! We got 2 rooms next to each other. They loved having their own private room with bathroom. Both rooms had really cool balconies that looked out on the front street. Ours was enclosed and had beautiful sitting area with really nice furniture with lovely plants & orchids. They have a central courtyard in the back, which is where they serve a beautifully presented continental breakfast. There is a separate charge for this, and I don\u2019t think it\u2019s necessary every day that you\u2019re there, but I would recommend it at least once. Be sure you check with Abel or Sergio about this. We had reserved the deluxe breakfast for each day, and when we tried to opt out of breakfast altogether for our last morning there they said that was not allowed. The only negative is that the breakfast courtyard area is right next door to a school. We were there in the summer, and were only there 1 weekday, so we only heard the loud noises one day, but people sensitive to excess noise while eating should take note. It IS happy noises, though; kids laughing & playing, but it can bug some people. Abel & Sergio are wonderful guys!

Unfortunately, I could not go due to time constraints, but I would have loved to have done this with him. I felt an instant rapport with both guys, and can definitely see staying friends. I have read some complaints on TripAdvisor, but it seems these are from people who come home and complain after the trip.

But after doing some TA searching for Barcelona, the combination of character, location and price seemed worth the gamble. We were not disappointed. Hidden away on the second floor of a typical block of apartments on the Gran Via Corts Catalines, it took our taxi driver a couple of tries before he found it, but once we buzzed in and clambered up the stairs, we were welcomed warmly by Axel (who had already been helpful in assisting me to select the best room for our needs and providing an e-mailed map prior to our arrival). We were given a personal tour of the small hotel (10 rooms), recently created from two homes, and given good advice on local dining. (Weirdly, I also had my middle finger printed to electronically access the lower and upper doors). By European standards, the room was large, with a small balcony looking out onto the Gran Vias Corts Catalanes, which is insanely busy and noisy, but, when we shut the double doors, the room was remarkably quiet. The floor was a lovely mosaic left over from the hotel's previous incarnation as a private home. A chandelier hung from the high ceiling, and a very spacious bathroom with an arching window was separated from the main room by a sliding door. Everything was clean and comfortable (though I do prefer a softer mattress). A simple breakfast of toast, croissant and coffee or tea comes with the room. Kind of. When paying the bill, I found I was charged for the second day's breakfast. When I enquired, I was told breakfast wasprovided for the first night only; after that you had to pay. I explained that this was not made clear to me when I booked, and the charge was quickly dropped. Suggestion: either include breakfast for each night of a guest's stay, or don't. Just make the arrangement clear. The first morning we had our breakfast on a lovely terrace adjacent to three rooms (though I wondered how quiet they would be as people in the rooms were separated from diners by only a sliding glass door); the second morning, because the terrace rooms were taken and we didn't have access, we ate in the sitting room. Decor of the small lobby and shared space might not be for everyone -- cluttered European eclectic, I guess I'd call it -- but it's fun and unpretentious. Best of all, perhaps, is the hotel's location.

We travel for a variety of reasons but one of them is go and experience something we cant get at home. All too often the good hotels cater for the majority with inevitable results. Quality yes, but tinged with a general sense of 'sameness'. The danger of daring to be different is that you cant please everyone which means that some people just wont appreciate this charming little gem. Which is a shame but a price worth paying. The owners of this hostel have dared to be different. From the outset its obvious they have trusted their own tastes and created a place they would like to stay. I must say they do have a certain style in abundance, i never knew you could cram so much in to one place. I was apprehensive when i arrived but sad to leave (Barcelona its self may have played a part in that). As said above this is a cracking little gem of a hostel. First things first. Its a hostel but not in the sense that many from the uk would understand a hostel. If you now have pictures of sweaty backpackers in some bunk bed ridden hostels you are so far off base. Its just a small hotel, most of the rooms do open out onto a small shared terrace, where breakfast is served. It is 'cosy' in so many ways. It is actually set on the first floor of an old fashioned apartment block so don't expect a big grand entrance. Second, the antiques. As the title says this is the antidote to IKEA. They once ran an add in the UK that said chuck out your chintz, well the better stuff ended up here. Don't get me wrong I like IKEA, in fact the other hotel we stayed at on our trip was extremely tastefully furnished from IKEA. This is just the other end of the taste range. When you first arrive its a bit over powering but it has a charm all of its own, you just need to go with it. Third, as this is a small hotel don't expect the kind of staff you will find in the chains or larger (i.e. fluent in 5 languages, appearing like magic ready to serve your every whim and with an encyclopedic knowledge of any subject you might want to know about). If, like us, you arrive when the owners are not there you may have to deal with someone who only speaks Spanish, and my Spanish was severely tested - it paid to arrive in Spain with basic phrases; I have a room reservation in the name of...., what time is breakfast? and can you record my finger print so i can get back in - you know the basics (if you go you will soon understand the last bit - that was a conversation i never practiced before hand). However, the owners English was so much better than my Spanish and once he arrived all confusion was gone. He provided us with several very good recommendations for eating out and i really got the feeling they were recommendations of places 'he' would eat. The general feeling you get with this place is that they have created somewhere they would want to stay. The feeling you get with this place is personal, not cooperate. Its not a big supper smooth hotel, and on the downside i did find it a little bit too noisy, but on the whole i'm really glad we choose to stay here.

Our first stop on the journey was Barcelona. As such, our time there set the tone for the rest of our adventure. Largely due to the quality experience we had at Hotel L'Antic Espai, our Barcelona immersion was amazing, and we were set to have a great continued adventure. From the Sangria greeting, to the antiques decorating each room, to the charming patio wherein guests can receive a deluxe breakfast to start each day, L'Antic Espai reeks of character. Comprised of only a handful of guest rooms, it also offers a quaint, intimate ambiance. Because of the small number of guests at any time, the owners and employees are able to provide guests with extensive one-on-one attention. One of the owners, Abel, gave us a restaurant recommendation that led to the best meal we had during our entire 3 weeks in Spain. He also sent us to an authentic Flamenco show we otherwise would not have chosen. I arrived with 4 other girls and we were initially placed in two rooms. However, because one of the rooms was small, the owners gave us a third room on the house. This was an exceptionally rare and kind act of customer service that really made our stay more enjoyable. We felt very at home very quickly in our stay (probably too much at home!). Abel and others answered all of our questions and really just embraced our presence. We actually felt like they were our friends by the time we left. The hotel is just a few blocks from many different things, including the metro. Yet, it is secluded enough that there is no noise and you don't feel overwhelmed by locals or tourists. Overall a great location. Quality of experience is often about level and type of expectation. Thus, I think it's important to clarify that Hotel L'Antic Espai is not the W or the Four Seasons. Other than great atmosphere, fabulous pricing, and superb customer service, there are few amenities. It is a boutique hotel with a very interesting and unique feel. For me, that makes the place amazing. But for those looking for a cookie-cutter, upscale hotel this is not the place for you. Note: There is no elevator. If you come armed with heavy luggage, beware: you will have to carry it up a long, winding staircase. Overall, I would highly recommend this hotel.", "Date": "June 24, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "San Francisco", "Title": "\u201cA Great Memory-loved it\u201d", "Author": "MotherDaughter1", "ReviewID": "UR68455710", "Content": "As we approached the address the cab driver couldn't quite find the hotel and then I remembered reading on Trip Advisor that it is on the second floor so the entrance is not that noticeable.

While the location was really perfection--very centrally located to the major sites and metro--the magic of this place is the ambiance and hospitality. The owners have invested in creating a little of oasis of beauty and serenity. There are about 10 rooms and the ones in the front have double paned windows to ensure a peaceful night sleep. Each room is appointed with lovely detail and antiques from around the world. I even loved the scent of the bath soap, which gives you the sense that every detail was considered. The rooms in the back, have access to a patio. Had the hotel been fully booked, we may not have known this, but because it wasn't, the owner invited to enjoy it and treated us to a bottle of champagne since I was celebrating a birthday.

They gave us advice on where to go and not to go, and helped us with cultural differences and language. The boys are also from different areas in the world, they had alot of interesting things to tell us. This place is quiet and has beautiful, unique pieces in every room. They offer free breakfast, and we got to eat on the terrace which is so pretty and nice. We had toast and jam and hot chocolate, which was different than what we are used to, but very yummy. Our room (101) faced the street, and I was amazed at how quiet it was, because we had a balcony and a big door, but no noise came through from the cars and the action. Everything was clean and functional of course. The rooms are not as big as many U.S. hotel rooms, but that was no problem for us, it was definitely comfortable. Also, people who have problem climbing stairs, there are 25 steps to get to the hotel. It isn't far, but if you have bad knees, be careful. The surrounding area is pretty safe, we had no problems at all. There are lots of small grocery stores and restaurants. We went out dancing one night. That was a different experience. The clubs didn't really open till 2am, so keep that in mind. They let us use their internet for free. They were having some issues with their internet company, if you are absolutely dependent on internet, be cautious. But we were just updating family on our adventure, and not being charged was a major plus. It's centrally located, we were in between Gaudi and the beach and Las Ramblas.

I had a difficulty finding it when I arrived, though - it appeared that this small hotel was on the second floor of an apartment building, and its sign is not very easy to find unless you know what you are looking for. In addition, the building has no elevator, so I had to drag my bag upstairs because a roommaid was the only person present there when I arrived. My single room was small but air-conditioned and very cozy, full of antique-looking furniture. The wardrobe door cracked when opened or closed, but somehow did not feel this sound irritating because it looked so antique that you hardly expected it to open noiselessly. The elegant desk was a real period piece, with some old china decorating it. On the whole, the hotel definitely has an atmosphere - it is packed with antique furniture, china and chandeliers. The bathroom with a shower was quite a good size, but the toilet was too close to the shower cabin, so if I was taller and my legs were an inch longer, I might have had a problem fitting them into this small space. Breakfast is not included, but you can have it for an extra charge, and they will serve it either in the sitting room or on the veranda at any time you want to have it. I only had it on one day, and it was very good and served by the owner of the hotel. The owners are very helpful - they gave me some useful advice on how to see the most of Barcelona in the time that I had, and how to take some safety precautions in public places. On the day of my departure, after I checked out, I store my bag at the owner's desk as my flight was later in the evening.

I booked it based on the reviews on Trip Advisor. People had mentioned that it was upstairs,and had no lift-maybe a problem with3 large cases and 2 sets of golf clubs(we were going on somewhere else). But when we arrived we were told to leave our cases and a lovely young man brought them all upstairs for us,checked us in quickly and bought us a glass of wine as a welcome on the terrace - lovely! We were in Room 7 and our friends were in Room 2. Both lovely rooms,exactly as pictured. Neither were massive but perfectly adequate for somewhere like Barcelona,where you are out all day sightseeing anyway. The shared terrace that led off our room was absolutely delightful- a quiet haven from the hustle and bustle of the city. Another reviewer said the bed in Room 7 was exceptionally tiny which was a concern. We have a 6' bed at home, and while this bed wasnt as big,it was perfectly comfortable- we had a good nights sleep. There was a little noise from the tv area when we first went to bed,but it didnt last long,and is more the fault of inconsiderate guests rather than the hotel. The only time we felt or heard the subway was on the terrace,and that was just a vibration. I believe our friends heard it more in their room, but they had such a good nights sleep they overslept by 2 hours,and only woke when I texted them to see if they were ok. The bathrooms were small, but good showers, complimentary toiletries and clean! Every single member of staff fell over themselves to make sure our stay was a good one. We were given an excellent restaurant reccommendation, Mohanned was extremely helpful and always smiling. Abel helped us make a car hire booking for nearly an hour when I'm sure he had more things he could have been doing, and we had a quiet drink on the terrace at midnight one night,coffee again on the terrace the next night. All with a big smile. The hotel was spotless,and our bed linen was lovely -the kind I have in my own home. We also liked that you were only admitted via intercom at the main door and that there was always someone on duty- it felt very secure. We would definitely stay here again,and wouldnt hesitate to recommend it to anyone we know. The only people I would say it isnt suitable for is younger people who want to go out til the early hours then continue the party back at their hotel.

A nice small friendly Hostel BUT First impressions are very important and here, they are not good. The apartment block is shabby and the dusty Hotel sign gives a poor impression. You enter into a dark unwelcoming Hallway and have to climb 25 steps to reach the Hotel. There is no lift and so it is totally unsuitable for anyone with mobility problems although this is not advertised prominently on the website. When you reach the Hotel, you enter into another world..filled with treasures. There are some beautiful pieces and it is tastefully decorated. The owners are friendly. It has a fantastic location. Our bedroom was nicely decorated, but I do feel that the love the owner has for his antiques is detrimental to the comfort of the guests. The bed was uncomfortable, the pillow more so, the blanket was grubby. We had to wrestle with the beautiful wardrobe door to open it. There were no chairs, only beds, a wardrobe and a stool and an elegant cabinet between the beds which was already cluttered. A TV on the wall worked intermittantly. The fantastic chandelier gives off a very bright and harsh light as do the bedside lamps not making for a restful atmosphere. It was not a room you would want to spend much time in! No complaints about the shower room, it was clean and functional. Quite noisy with the rumble of the underground and traffic, not to mention the paper thin walls where every sound could be heard. No respite either in the communal TV room. Again, the love for antiques overshadows comfort. The beautiful antique chairs are uncomfortable, you are looking over a sea of distracting antiques and people coming and going if you want to watch TV. This room is right in the middle of the main thoroughfare of the Hotel so again, no peace and quiet after the bustle of the city. It would have been a better idea to utilise one of the terrace rooms as a quiet communal area. Breakfast. One has to reach the terrace by walking through someones bedroom! Again, the breakfast is beautifully presented with china crockery and silver antique cutlery, but it makes the breakfast look far better than it actually is. Quite an expensive breakfast, but certainly not a quality one with poor ingredients used and coffee served from nice little pots, but usually lukewarm. Also, other guests share a table. To sum up...this is a quirky unusual and perfectly located Hotel with pleasant staff, but for me the cons outnumbered the pros.

It\u2019s in a great location too, right in the centre equidistant from all the nicest areas (El Born, Barri Gotic, Eixample) and 1 min off the main high street shopping drag (not too close to La Rambla either so you won\u2019t get infected by its tacky over-touristified poison).

We ran into her again in Collioure!). Abel made dinner reservations for us, arranged for breakfast and offered to take us to the airport early the next morning. We spent the afternoon walking to Sagrada Familia and exploring the area around the hotel. It has a great location. The room was spotlessly clean, the bed was comfortable, the bathroom was modern and spotless. On our second visit, we were given room 102, which was even better. A very large room, it has a spectacular ceiling and a private balcony overlooking the street. This could be one of our favorite hotel rooms ever. Absolutely lovely. The whole hotel has been recently, painstakingly renovated and is filled with antiques -- everything from the furniture to the teapot at morning breakfast. Absolutely exquisite. One of our favorite moments was when we came back to the hotel with some pastries from a bakery down the street. We asked Sergio if we could have two forks to eat them with. Moments later, there he was with a footed silver tray topped with a paper doily, upon which were two antique china plates, forks and linen napkins.

I am glad we did. This is a charming hotel with friendly and helpful staff. From the welcome Cava to our departure, no effort was spared to make guests feel comfortable and at home. Firstly this is quite a difficult hotel to find. The taxi driver who drove us there had never heard of it and missed it first time round. The sign is discreet to say the least. The best way to find it is probably to head for the Patagonia Restaurant at 660 Gran V\u00eda Cortes Catalanes- the door to the hotel can then easily be found. Entry is up a flight of marble stairs to the first-floor, which would possibly make the hotel unsuitable for travellers with limited mobility as there is no lift. It looks to me as if the hotel takes up a floor of an old apartment building. This is a charming hotel, ideally located with most of the main tourist attractions within easy walking distance. The owners were happy to offer assistance and local advice and would ring ahead to make reservations at restaurants as well as recommend some very good ones. Our room was a decent size and comprised a balcony, bedroom, dressing room and bathroom. Standards are very high here and the room was kept spotless. There was no \"Do not disturb\" sign but we never were- despite making a couple of late starts to the day. The balcony was shared with two other rooms, which may raise privacy issues for some but wasn't a problem for us as we went during low season and kept the curtains drawn when changing. The bed was just to my liking- nice and firm- and meant that I got a good night's sleep right from the start. Breakfast is ordered the night before and served on the balcony. We didn't take advantage of this as there are a number of coffee shops in the immediate area where we preferred to take breakfast. There is a safe in the reception area where guests can store valuables rather than in the room. This isn't a large chain hotel, so does not possess some of the facilities that would normally be associated with one of those- there's no bar, restaurant, health spa or swimming pool; the rooms don't have mini-bars or tea/coffee making facilities, however L'Antic Espai more than makes up for such minor shortcomings with charm. Wi-fi internet is available as is free access to a computer. I cannot imagine a major chain hotel decorated like this. There is beautiful period furniture in the rooms, collections and display cabinets all over the hotel. I noticed that the marquetry on our bed matched that on the bedside table and the wardrobe- someone has gone to a lot of trouble furnishing the rooms to their taste. There is barely a space in the whole hotel that is not taken up by a china figurine or other collectible. It could be said that the overall effect verges on kitsch, however this is no bad thing and gives the hotel a unique character. I have never stayed in a hotel quite like this and am very glad I chose L'Antic Espai. Both of us agree that we would happily stay there again.

The entrance is unobtrusive and you walk up to the first floor. I assume there are apartments above the hotel. I did find the room, a 'superior single' very small and dark. Several rooms, including mine, opened onto a large balcony. This means that if you have your curtains/door open, other guests on the balcony can see into your room, which is a bit intrusive. If you then close the curtains for privacy, the room is very dark. If i were to go again, i would pay more for a larger room i think. Also, some one was smoking on the balcony and the smoke and stench filled my room so i had to shut the door. Something you will find here which i greatly value is: cleanliness and friendly staff. The toilet and shower were squeaky clean and the sheets were crisp and clean.This is where so many hotels (even so-called top of the range hotels) get it wrong, as nothing is more off putting than detritus from the previous guest. Comfortable bed, great pillow- where can i get one of those? I met 3 different staff members, including the Spanish maid referred to by another reviewer. All were charming,smiling and attentive. So what if the maid speaks no English; this is Spain! Many hotels give solo travellers a raw deal, and many hotels don't want one-nighters. This hotel treats everybody like family and values all guests and that is probably why it is so popular. I may only have stayed for 1 night, but i will certainly return and i have also told all my friends about it. It feels more like staying in a friend's apartment than a hotel. Agree with the other poster that the balcony is noisy, sounds like a playground nearby.

Firstly, when you find a cheap hotel, you might not be surprised to find that it's a bit ropey or that it has seen better days. Not so the Antic Espai. It's really centrally situated.

There wasn't much natural light, but that's probably not a bad thing as it keeps the room cool (I didn't need to turn on the air conditioning). Like all the rooms, it was full of charming and rather kitsch antiques. The en-suite bathroom with sink, shower and toilet was clean and functional. The flat screen TV with DVD player was great: I used it to play some music CDs. The staff explained that they have a supply of DVDs which guests can borrow. I was also amazed to see a room service menu, offering drinks of all kinds. I was a bit worried about having to ring the bell every time I wanted to get in, especially when I came back late. But the night staff were charming and discreet. These are the same people who serve breakfast in the mornings. For 8 euros, breakfast was plentiful. One day I had it on the terrace in the company of some pretty birds in cages. The other two mornings I was in the salon area. I read that somebody complained about noise from the kitchen. I was right next to this little kitchen/work area and I wasn't at all bothered by noise. The most striking thing about the hotel was the staff. They were attentive, polite and went out of their way to make my stay a success. I didn't catch all of their names, but Mohanet (I hope I spelt his name right) stands out for his smiling and helpful attitude. He was charming, and really made me feel at ease, which is important for single travelers, especially for those who don't speak the language. In my guide book (Time Out), the Antic Espai is listed as a budget hotel. One or two of the more dissatisfied reviewers on here should maybe bear that in mind: you can't expect a five-star experience in a hotel like this. The Antic Espai does what it does perfectly.

Luckily for us, they had a guy (Axel) covering who was very helpful, and really went out of his way to recommend local restaurants and bars. Nothing was too big an ask, and to get this kind of help in an unfamiliar city is invaluable. Our room was beautifully and tastefully decorated, and stepped out into a communal terrace where we had breakfast on a couple of mornings. The only thing I'd say against this wonderful place, is that, while romantic, it doesn't feel hugely private. The communal areas were certainly welcome, but sometimes it felt a little awkward stepping outside with others right outside your door. Small thing, and it certainly didn't affect our enjoyment of the place. The location was perfect, we walked to Sagrada Familia in less than 20mins, and the touristy areas were 5mins walk away.

If natural sunlight is important to you, before booking a room in this hotel, confirm that your room has a window. I was aghast (and in tears) to find myself in a room that was totally dark save electric lights. The man at the desk said that before booking either of the interior rooms, the person doing the booking notifies the prospective guest that these rooms are interior (there's no way to tell on the internet pictures that 109 and 110 are windowless). Staff and I agreed (I had our e-mail correspondence with me) that somehow that information was overlooked with my booking. In previous travels before booking a room, I've asked what my room overlooked but it never entered my mind that a hotel room would have no window at all. Had I known, I would never have booked this room; I would have gladly paid more for another room in this hotel or looked elsewhere. This is not a money issue. While this is my first visit to Spain, I've traveled extensively in Europe, paid 60E and stayed in small rooms that had one window. When I travel I walk everywhere and at midday I enjoy coming back to my hotel to rest and read. I did not do this in Barcelona, as it was difficult to find comfort in a room that was forever black. I want to be fair: the men at the front desk (Axel and Sergio were on vacation) were friendly and helpful when I needed directions and they made reservations at a lovely restaurant for me the first night. The bed was comfortable and there was plenty of hot water. The place was clean. I loved the thick terry robe. I saw other rooms in the hotel that had windows, those facing Grand Via and the patio, and no question about it, they were delightful. The architecture is intriguing and the decorations pleasantly quirky. I'm recommending the hotel for all the reasons I cited above. It's difficult for me to rate the service more than average because if the omission in the booking process -- a waterfall effect. I understand that for some a window is not important.

That made us feel welcome when returning home to the Hostal each day. His recommendations for things to see were very useful including a hidden Salvador Dali museum in town and also a trip to Figueres (Dali's birthplace and the site of a museum he built to house many of his large and impressive works). Axel helped make a great trip, even better. So, a few words on the Hostal: it lives up to it's reputations - the location is quite good - and it's deserved ranking here on Tripadvisor. The maid service is also terrific. The room was always cleaned and aired when we returned. There are some points worth noting. I mention these as useful notes and not as complaints. The beds in our room were quite small. I'm 6'2\" and I did sleep at a diagonal. Not a big deal. I did not ask the staff to address this minor issue, but if you are my height or larger, you might make note of this particularly with room 104. The bed was comfortable, I slept as well or better than on other trips. The birds out on the patio are sweet. Their quiet peeps made for a soothing sound to fall asleep. Our bathroom had a small shower. Quite small. I get the sense that a large bathtub is not a priority for most who would stay at the Espai.

Hotel interior is very unique, filled with valuable pieces of antic furniture and decoration, rooms are clean, breakfast delicious and sufficient to hold you for the entire day of sightseeing. Precious little things such as travel guides and books about Barcelona, a collection of DVD and lap-top computer with a wireless internet that are available at no cost for each guest, made my stay cozy and comfortable. Last but not least, Abel\u2019s and Sergio\u2019s hospitability and attention to details (fresh flowers every morning), their knowledge about hot spots and special deals for hotel\u2019s guests (unforgettable dinner at two-star Michelin restaurant for 20 euros!!!) and authentic Barcelona experience (flamenco evening with the best table in house), made my stay memorable.

However, this turned out to be a blessing in disguise, as it allowed us to find L'Antic Espai (via tripadvisor). I am always drawn to quirky hotels (not the main chains) and if they are family-owned, so much the better. Every experience with L'Antic has been top drawer. This included the initial communications (replies to m y emails within minutes, and I had the booking done within an hour of first coming across the hotel). On arrival, Sergio greeted us and gave us a helping hand to bring our bulky luggage upstairs. We were quickly shown to our lovely room (105, a double and single bed - large hotels take note - it can be done) which looked on to the gorgeous terrace. Abel gave us helpful instructions on returning our hire car to Sants rail station. From the moment you arrive, you are aware of the quality of the furnishing and the decor. What was particularly pleasing for me was that the owners never showed any concern about the fact that our child (a 7 year old) could potentially damage their valuable furnishings, crockery etc. (believe me the hotel is simply overflowing with wonderful things), they seemed genuinely pleased that we were staying with them, and indeed were very patient and caring with our little boy. They were not to know that our son is quite mature and very careful for his age, but I know that the staff of many other hotels can make parents feel quite uneasy in these situations. We were asked if we wanted to take breakfast (7 euro per person), and we decided ( I am pleased to say) to aval of this. The breakfast was set up on the terrace bang on time each morning at the prearranged time (unlike us!), and to have a wondeful breakfast (fruit juice, fresh fruit, yoghurt and muesli, toast, divine jams, croissant with cheese and ham, cakes, fresh coffee) all served in quality china, on a terrace surrounded by greenery, and to the backdrop of the gentle tinkle from a little fountain, is my idea of how to start a day. If you can get his for 7 euros anywhere else, let me know. (Forgot to mention that they also served up lovely hot chocolate for our son). On another evening, Axel (hope I spelt this right) the charming Argentinian night porter, was good enough to set up wine in a chiller (again with two lovely wine glasses) on the terrace. The beds are extremely comfortable, and the bathroom very clean, hot shower and nice clean soft towels - oh, and lovely fluffy dressing gowns. The original tiles and lovely light fittings all add to the experience. The guys recommended a number of restaurants but we were only able to use one (the Patagonia Restaurant directly below the hotel). This is not owned by the hotel and is entirely independant, but I can wholeheartedly recommend it. It was quite busy on a Tuesday night, with many Spanish business people there. Do yourself a favour and order the steak (it is shipped in directly from Argentina), and the crepes / toffee combination for dessert is delicious too. The hotel does have an arrangment that allows you to prepay and order from a pre-set menu at well discounted rates from the Patagonia, and It is excellent value. If you have an early start ot make the next day, it is also extremely convenient, but in no way compromises quality! The guys sorted us out with a taxi for our departure (again, right on time), as well as a very early breakfast, once again on the terrace - at 7.30! By this stage you realise that we loved our stay at the 'Espai', and we are counting the days to our inevitable return.

If I travel to Barcelona again, I have no doubts about where I want to stay: Hostal L'Antic Espai. Really, it was a flawless stay. The location is, in my opinion, perfect. Just a short walk to Pla\u00e7a de Catalunya. It also only took us about 5 minutes to walk to Palau de la Musica for an evening performance. This is a lovely area and though the hotel is just off a big street (and our balcony faced that street) we weren't bothered by the noise. The sound-proof windows are pretty remarkable. We could hear traffic though and I thought it would disturb my sleep, but I didn't even notice it. Our room was just off the lobby. I was also concerned about the noise factor with that, but - again - my sleep was never disturbed by lobby noise. We could hear people talking, etc. in the evenings, but I slept really well at Hostal L'Antic Espai and the mornings seemed really quiet. Breakfast was also gorgeous! The first morning we had breakfast out in the sitting area and the spread was simply stunning. The following three mornings we took breakfast in our room. You order the night before and then they have yummy breakfast ready for you at whatever time you specify the next morning. This was particularly impressive on our last morning when we had to leave quite early for the airport. Everything we ordered was delivered right on time and was a great start to our long journey home. As was being delivered to the airport...just perfect. I've read where other reviewers have called the mattresses hard. I would say they are firm, certainly. However, not hard. Firm, but there is also a softness to them. They feel like high quality mattresses. And, the pillows are to die for. They were perfect for me. My dad also said he slept very well and noted the amazing pillows before I had a chance to. I wish I had that pillow at home, actually. The hotel is very clean. I've stayed in other clean hotels before. What sets Hostal L'Antic Espai apart are the attention to details. Fresh flowers, detailed care in everything down to the porcelein light switches. You do have to ring to get up to the hotel. I found this to be a comforting bit of security and never had any trouble getting in day or night. Drawbacks? None. My dad and I both loved Hostal L'Antic Espai and thought the owners were really wonderful! They go out of their way to make you feel special. They're also really warm and helpful with recommendations, directions, etc. One last thing. The hotel has wifi. So you can bring your own laptop and easily access the Internet from your room. They have a computer in the lobby that they said we could use; however, they also had a little laptop that they let me borrow (it was always available when I wanted to write home and check on my family). That was such an unexpected bonus and really fantastic. We also loved watching DVDs in our room of an evening - the hotel has a large selection of DVDs that you can borrow for free.

The last night of our stay...the manager informed us that when we showered the water was somehow leaking into the downstairs so they had us move to Room 105. They were very sorry and kind about having to move us but Room 105 was bigger so it worked out! While both Room 104 and 105 are suitable for 3 people, Room 104 felt a tad small. I would recommend room 105 over 104 in terms of size. Room 105 also has access to the balcony. While the balcony isn't HUGE it is still a very nice size. But be warned...there are about 3 other rooms that have access to the same balcony and so you would have to be careful not to stay out on the balcony too late at night so you don't disturb the other guests. For the most part we had the balcony to ourselves. There is no elevator so lugging your suitcase up the stairs is a pain but the people there were kind enough to help us.

The hotel is an absolute gem and a real experience, There is not a space that isn't filled with ornaments, pictures, furniture etc, but there was not a speck of dust to be found. The bathrooms are tiny but spotlessly clean, although we did wonder how an overweight person would fit into the shower. A lot of thought has gone in to creating a warm, welcoming and really unusual place to stay. It is very centrally located and in a safe area. On a previous visit to Barcelona I stayed in the Gothic quarter and felt very nervous at night even though I was with my husband. Here we felt quite safe being out after dark. Abel and Sergio were so helpful, they are better than the tourist information office. They gave us maps and directions and recommended wonderful places to eat. I do second a previous review extolling the virtues of the Ciutat Comtal tapas restaurant.

I did urge her to mention this to Abel and Sergio but she didn't want to make a fuss so it is her own fault ,as I'm sure they would have changed her room All in all we really enjoyed our stay and would thoroughly recommend it to anyone looking for something a little different.

Lovely area from which we walked to the area of Gracia as well as the beach. The area felt safe at night. Close to three metro stations, lots of restaurants etc. It was a treat to live in an apartment building instead of an ordinary hotel. We really liked the tiled floors \u2013 they gave the hotel a very warm and homey feeling. Very clean and tidy! The room was well kept during our stay and smelled fresh and clean. Friendly staff! Both those who spoke excellent English, such as Felipe, and the ladies who spoke less English were very nice. It was not a problem at all to be buzzed in 24/7! They also let us leave our bags in the reception area for a few hours on the day of our departure which we appreciated. Lovely-looking terrace with flowers and bird cages. If you travelled with friends and occupied all 4 rooms facing the terrace it would have been absolutely perfect! CONS Although the terrace looks very nice, it just might be a little bit awkward to dress/undress, or take a nap before going out at night, with strangers staring right at you only meters from your bed. Literally! Pictures we had seen mislead us to believe that each room had its own little table with chairs right outside \u2013 instead there were two sitting areas and thus, when they were user by other guests, or staff for that matter (upon arrival there was a man working on some picture frames out there, smoking cigarettes), you had absolutely no privacy in your room unless you kept the heavy curtains closed. Although it was permitted, luckily the other guests were not smoking cigarettes! The mattress was quite firm but not too bad, but the pillow was close to a sack of cement. The blanket that we found in the wardrobe and used on top of the bed sheet could use a wash since it was rather full of stains - though if previous guests had folded it and put it back we can see how this could have been overlooked by the maintenance staff. Water pressure was really bad \u2013 more like a drizzle than pressure \u2013 I had to wash my hair in the sink. The air con worked most of the time, but the last night we had to keep the door open to the terrace that we shared. However, we did not feel very comfortable with this and closed the door again after an hour or so. Doors seemed to be paper thin and since you would be able to hear a whisper in the hallway you can imagine what hollering pre-adolescent boys sounded like shouting and slamming doors. (Loud children are not the hotel's fault of course, but just to give you a picture...) The room was smaller than we expected. Or at least it seemed small due to the placement of the furniture, one double and one single bed. We are average size people and we seemed to constantly be in each others way while moving around the room. It would certainly be very crowded with three people staying together. We stayed here three nights in October, and in short we pretty much agree with everything \u201cbrabb\u201d said on Oct 5 about the hotel in his review (which we found honest and really not overly critical.).

We had a wonderful stay there. We liked the fact the hotel was not directly on Las Ramblas or the busier streets of Barcelona. Yet, it was close to restaurants, cafes, metro, Plaza Cataluna, and Las ramblas. The bathrooms, particularly the showers, were on the small side as was previously mentioned in the reviews, but we made it work. The bathrooms were efficient, clean and we were so anxious to hit the streets and see this beautiful city that it was absolutely no problem making it work. I recommend booking a room that goes out to the lovely terrace. It was a great place to have a glass of cava or wine in the afternoon or evening. However, the main reason I would recommend this hotel and would personally stay there again when I return to Barcelona is the incredible staff of Hostal L'Antic Espai. Abel, Sergio, Felipe and all the staff made our stay memorable!! They always took the time to make excellent recommendations to us and they were absolutely wonderful and helpful in every way. It was great chatting with them and sharing our daily adventures with them.

Firstly, I should warn visitors that they should consider this less a hotel to visit and more a chance to live in part of an apartment in Barcelona. The entrance is via an unassuming door and you climb the stairs to the entrance which is lovely, for being unexpected. Myself and my husband felt like we were living in Barcelona for the weekend rather than staying in a hotel. The staff on reception were always warm and friendly and their English was always far better than our Spanish (I confess that my poor language abilities in Spain, mean I am grateful for finding that they have made the effort so we can communicate, when my contribution is limited to asking for \"two beers\"! The location was also great, we walked for most of the time, or took the tourist bus, which was very handy for getting around. We didn't eat breakfast in the hotel, as it was pricey, we tended to wander to a cafe up the street a little. However, we did have a few drinks on the patio, which was lovely. The room (107) was filled with lovely antiques, and as we don't tend to spend much time in the hotel, the size was fine. The small seating area was nice to have and relax when we were in the room, and of course we could always sit on the patio, with the birds. It was a little noisy in the room, but not as bad as we expected as we were on the main road. The only think I would say, is that I could also feel the metro as it passed underneath. We have already recommended this hotel to friends and would do so again happily. It's a lovely, friendly home from home.

I had high expectations of the hotel due to the glowing reviews on Trip Advisor--which are usually on point. I'm sad to report that my experience was not as wonderful as some of the other reviewers. When my boyfriend and I arrived at the hotel, I pressed the button outside the unassuming wooden door, buzzing the front desk. The response was a curt \"Hola\"--and then silence. I stammered, \"Hola. We are here for the hotel?,\" and we were buzzed in without any other instructions. When we walked inside, we were met with total darkness--the inside foyer was pitch black. Luckily someone else who was familiar with the building was right behind us--and looked at us suspiciously before leaning past us and pushing the button on the right-hand wall that turned on the lights. We were shocked to see we were in the bottom floor of what looked to be an apartment building under renovation--the banister for the stairs was covered with bubble wrap. We didn't know what to do--there were no signs for the hotel anywhere. I thought maybe we had somehow ended up at the offices for the hotel, instead of the hotel itself. After a few moments of deliberation, my boyfriend headed up the stairs to see if he could find someone to help. He came back down and told me that the hotel was on the second floor and that we would have to carry our luggage up the two flights of stairs. Not really a problem since we packed light, but I was surprised that no one had mentioned this as a major turn-off of the hotel. Once up on the second floor we were met by an indifferent porter who seemed to be more interested in returning to her movie (she was watching Harry Potter on the hotel computer--later she was intrigued by Myspace) than with helping us get settled. She did however extend a complementary drink to us, which was nice. Her English was not that good--our communication was a bit like caveman speak. When we got inside our room (107), we were surprised to see how dark it was--almost no natural light was coming in, and even when we turned on the lights, it was pretty darn dark. The indoor sitting room was cute, and access to the patio was nice, but my boyfriend couldn't get over how dark it was inside. The decorations were a bit too stuffy for my taste--with thick velvet curtains, brocaded bed spread, and delicate (and breakable!) vases and candy dishes strewn about. I was reminded of the times when I would visit the lonely old lady down the street from me while growing up--if I only had a few Werther's Originals to suck on, it would have been a scene out of my childhood. The bathroom was VERY clean--sparkling, even, but I was confused by all of the hooks in the bathroom--all of which seemed to have been placed for NBA basketball players--they were all at least 6 1/2 feet from the ground. The electrical plug (with built-in converter) in the bathroom did not work at all, so I had to plug the hairdryer into one of the sockets in the bedroom in order to dry my hair. Kinda inconvenient. I never met the hotel owners--they were nowhere to be found. The male front desk attendant on our second and third nights was quite helpful--his English very good as well. Another frustration was using the hotel's internet WiFi access. My boyfriend was able to connect using his hand held mobile device, but I was unable to connect on my laptop. When we asked the front desk attendant, he asked if I had a Mac (which I did) and told me that it was a known issue that sometimes Macs are able to connect to the network--sometimes not, and that they had no solution on how to fix it. Both my boyfriend and I pressed for a better explanation, and asked if they could get someone from the internet or router company to troubleshoot, but we were pretty much shot down and told that there was nothing that could be done, but that if I wanted to use the hotel computer when no one was using it for work, I could. Of course every time I popped my head out to see if they were using the computer, they always were. Somehow my boyfriend was able to figure out how to get my computer connected (I think he had to default to a different setting), so we were finally able to use the internet w/ my laptop--but I found it very annoying that the hotel does not have instructions for guests with Macs--especially since they know it's a reoccurring issue. For a time we seriously considered moving hotels since we were unhappy with the service, but decided it wasn't worth the trouble to unpack all our stuff and try to find another room. I seriously wished I had been able to book a room at the Banys Oriental--we walked by it and were jealous by it's cool hip vibe and beautiful modern decor. There were some other beautiful, modern hotels (with a ground floor lobbies!!!) on the neighboring blocks--wish we had been in one of those. The location for the hotel is good--in L'Example, just above the Barri Gotica, 10 minute walking distance from major shopping. Barcelona is a small city, so even when we ended a night in El Raval, we were able to walk home in about 20 minutes. All in all, this hotel was not for me. The lacking service and dark rooms were a major minus. On the plus side, our room was large--I liked the additional room and the bathroom was very clean. I would not recommend this hotel for folks looking for a hip experience, nor people who are used to excellent service.

Each response was detailed, VERY friendly and courteous. After booking via email, I had called the hotel directly (from Brooklyn, NY!) a week later to ask some more questions. Whomever I spoke to was eager to answer my questions and even confirmed my booking (without me asking). I know when calling overseas, you need to take the time difference into account. If no one answers, it's probably because they are busy taking care of their guests.

(Not too big a problem, since we weren't there much during the day, but contstant when we were.) The rooms that face the terrace have only the glass terrace doors for a noise barrier. We had very loud neighbors who partied in their room until 1 AM, then went out and returned noisily at 4 AM.

For me, this property served its purpose. It is quite well situated, attractive and clean. The negatives were the noise on Gran Via (not tons of traffic at night, but this is a major thoroughfare, so there are plenty of cars passing by at night) and the cramped quarters. The lobby is a hallway on the second floor so there really isn't a place to hang out. It has no windows and thus no natural light and the entrance is a bit awkward. Our room was acceptable in size given what I've experienced before in London and Paris and nicely appointed. I believe there was an interior sitting space, but it was not really inviting and again had no natural light. It's not though I wanted to spend all my time in the hotel, but I do like just a little space. The owners were helpful, but not as magical as I had assumed from some of the Trip Advisor accounts. Maybe I'm old fashioned, but one of the guys was wearing biker attire which I found a bit too casual and I'm a pretty laid back guy. Barcelona is definitely a place to splurge.

The location is great, very central (a five minutes-walk to the Placa de Catalunya where the airport-bus stops) and we never were afraid going home in the darkness. We had to ring a bell at the hotel-door because it lies on the first floor. You have to know that there is no lift. We got a very warm welcome and a free drink (wine, beer, water ..) which comes with a small snack (nuts etc.). We booked room 101 which has two beds and a small balcony to the street. The street is a main street but we had a wonderful sleep nevertheless. The rooms are amazing at the L\u00b4Antic Espai. It is like staying in another century with its old furniture, but it has all comfort you need (like a LCD-TV, DVD-Player). The mattresses are hard, which my husband liked (me not so much). The floor is a stone-floor with a mosaic and the bathroom has a shower and seems to be newly renovated. Everything is neat and clean and there were even fresh flowers in the room. Breakfast is not included. You can have it on a small terrace outside (we did not ask whether you can have it in your room, too) and you have to order it the evening before. Although we didn\u00b4t do that we could have a small breakfast at our first morning. We entered the terrace through another room which was free. There are some rooms connected to the terrace directly. I liked the rooms to the street more because they are more seperated. The reception is occupied 24 hours a day. When you come home into the hotel you always have to ring the bell outside and somebody says holla to you. Although we never knew that from a hotel we liked it very much because nowbody was able to enter the hotel if he hasn\u00b4t got a room there.

There were a few outweighing factors that assisted in making our decision: 1) Recommendations - As I mentioned, the place had received countless positive reviews and the hotel did fit the bill, by exceeding our expectations. 2) Location - The Hotel is conveniently located a few blocks from plenty of shopping stores and is approximately a 10 walking distance from Las Ramblas. There is a Metro stop approximately two blocks away and many historical sites and museums are within walking distance. 3) Price - In comparing prices to neighboring hotels, the price per night (for a triple bed) totalled approximately 144 (USD) 14, whereas other hotels charged as much as 400+ per night. The staff namely Sergio, Felipe, and Abel were extremely helpful and on numerous occasions went out of their way to feel guests feel welcomed. I personally goofed on our reservations a few times, which caused them to make several changes to our reservations and during each correspondence they warmly made my changes. The rooms are fashionably decorated (much like the staff) and offer a warm welcome. The terrace is a good spot to enjoy the weather while reading a book. You will be able to hear children laughing and playing as the Hotel lies near a school, but they cannot be heard once the doors are shut. Some both positive and not so positive remarks: positive: 1) The staff is super friendly and offers their advice when possible 2) Location - Close to restaurants, shopping, and attraction sites 3) Price - We couldn't find a hotel that offered the same rates where service was unparalleled 4) Free Internet (this helps out and if you'd like there are two Internet cafes nearby) negative: 1) the rooms are somewhat smaller than I was used to, but we managed without any complications 2) During the day you may be able to hear the kitchen a bit, but some earplugs (recommended for every travel) will easily solve the problem.

For a different hotel experience, this is fantastic. We felt as though we were guests of a well-to-do family from around the turn-of-the-century who owned one of those five-story houses along the Gran Via. We had probably the best room (and the most expensive at 135 euro), #102, because it includes the balcony that projects out over the front entrance.

I heard a few guests complaining to Sergio about this as well. The other thing that was disappointing is that there is no english TV channels which was surprising and not something I could easily get used too. Also on the website they state that they have laundry facilities but this is not really the case. They made us an offer to do one load of laundry (a full load only) for 20 Euros- we wanted to launder 2 pairs of jeans so of course I was not going to pay 20 Euros! Sergio and Able were polite but I didn't find them particularly friendly nor did they go our of their way to provide us with any information or assistance we needed.
