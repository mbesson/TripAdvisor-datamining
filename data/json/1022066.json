After first day they moved me to a proper room which seemed ok. third night they had decided to repack my stuff and move me back to the room under renovation which meant after a day out in the heat of instanbul no shower and i got back to late to change hotels so had to stay. rebooked a new hotel online and left the next morning. Hotel seems interested only in making money off people and cares nothing for the customers which is a pity because its in a perfect location for lots of major attractions. Anyone giving this hotel 5/5 has never stayed there.", "Date": "September 27, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "1", "Sleep Quality": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Service": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Reading, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cI hated it and will never go back - recommend you look for a different hotel\u201d", "Author": "kazoinks", "ReviewID": "UR116182482", "Content": "I would strongly recommend all travellers to stay away from this hotel. 1. I'm a solo traveller, paid 40 euro / night for a room that was little bigger then the bed in it, most of the furniture was broken in some respect and both the room and bed were dirty. 2. The television had such bad reception that it wasnt worth turning on, in fact it was more entertaining listening to the loud turkish family in the room next door - who often stayed up till the early hours of the morning. 3. I stayed for 3 days and during this time neither the bathroom towels or the linen on my bed was changed. My bed was only made up on the first day and any rubbish (apart from the empty water bottles) was left in the room. 4. The chap working reception during the day is friendly and appeared to be the only person working there capable of smiling or interested in making sure guests enjoyed their stay. The night staff were completely uninterested and prefered to ignore me. 5. The hotel is undergoing renovations, this meant that the hotel resturant on the roof was closed and there was no room (food) service. Breakfast was held in reception and the quality of food was poor and unappetizing - It was that bad that I decided to skip breakfast and eat my morning meal elsewhere. 6. I asked for a morning 7AM wake up call - this never materialized, thank goodness I had my mobile phone with me and set the alarm. 7. My room came with an extra remote control which had 2 different sized batteries (and no battery cover), I still have no idea what this remote is for. 8. My room also had a very distinct smell of stale cigarette smoke and the bathroom was mouldy and smelt of it. 9. My airport transfer to the hotel cost me 39 euro - I had to phone the hotel upon landing and enquire about my transfer as there was nobody waiting for me!!!!!! It cost me another 20 euro to get back to the airport. 10. I went up to the roof (where the resturant is supposed to be) to take some long exposure photos and well lets just say that I was disappointed by the 'view' and gave up getting any decent shots after about 10 minutes. All in all, its perfectly situated, unfortunately this doesnt make up for all the negative aspects. I won't mention the air conditioning is switched off in the bar / breakfast / reception area in the evening and lets not talk about the rude and uninterested bar 'boy'. This entire location is crammed full of hotels so my adivice is to LOOK FOR ANOTHER HOTEL!!!!!!!", "Date": "August 2, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "2", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "2", "Sleep Quality": "2", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Luxembourg", "Title": "\u201cVerry Bad Hotel\u201d", "Author": "baccardi1_10", "ReviewID": "UR113388908", "Content": "The first and last time i stay this Hotel,when i arrived they didnt have room for me so they whant me to stay 2 nigths in other Hotel but i refuse it so i need to whait 2 hours until i get my room and this room whas really not nice i dont know how they get 3 stars furniture whas more than basic and old phone dosent work no fridge just bed and verry small wardrobe.Mutch to expensif for what u get.

Door was closed 100%. The staff did it but they don't want to admit. The owner of the hotel doesn't do anything about the situation. The breakfast is very dirty. You can only drink dirty tea and that's it. They have no coffee, milk or limonade. Some staff members are arrogant. In the beginning they are kind but as soon you paid everything they start to behave arrogant. They also clean the rooms once in 4 days en change the bedding once in 4 \u00c3\u00a1 5 days. While you expect them to change everyday because yuo pay by day and you have the right on a clean room. The place where you have ''BREAKFAST'' is very dirty.
