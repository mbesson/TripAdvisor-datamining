Very lucky. It was during a big conference and every room in town was booked or the prices were well into the 200-300 euro level, something my budget could not accomodate. I jumped on Kayak to search and was clicking through to TripAdvisor to check reviews when Hostemplo popped up. I found out later thay had just posted the room after a cancellation. It was a little further out than I normally like to stay but the price was right and the reviews were promising. I was happy to find the place bright, clean and newly renovated. The management were super nice and helpful and professional. Unlike many smaller hotels there was no issue about coming and going 24 hours thanks to the security card system. Free coffee and juice. The room itself was tiny but very well laid out. Bright and clean and everything new. There was a bottle of water and a few chocolates on the bed waiting for me. A flat screen television. Small desk and chair. I had a single so it was a twin bed but nice linens and very comfortable. The bath room is small but well thought out. The glass door could be an issue if you are sharing.

There is no guarantee that rooms will be \"quiet\" or \"roomy.\" I have read several complaints regarding these two points. We didn't have a problem with either of these issues at all.
