It had restaurants, walmart, and several shops that are specific to the location close by without having to be stuck in the traffic with tourists. We do have some complaints though. The beds were rock hard. Now I like hard beds, but these were even hard for me. The pillows were super flat. So bring your pillows from home. (I know I will.)

When I originally booked the room I requested a tub, but I guess when I asked if we could have a room with a view he forgot about the tub so we got a room with a shower. All of these I can live with especially with the deal we were getting for our stay, but when we first went into our room my husband used the restroom and the toliet was filthy!!!

I slipped and fell during our vacation and broke my knee cap. My husband took me to an ER and I was given crutches and a removable cast. We booked this hotel at our last night in Branson before we catched a flight back to California. I didn't want to stay in other hotel because I am familiar with the brand and a member of Hilton Honors. I also needed the Business Center so I can call the airline for wheel chair transfers and to call my doctors in California. I know that Hilton hotels have a Business Center and felt comfortable that I will be taken care of by the concierge or front desk. True enough, I asked for a handicap room on the first floor when I called to book it since I needed the bench seat for my shower. At first, there was no handicap room available. I asked for anything that is on the first floor and was booked into a King size room with a shower. However, when we checked in we were told that a handicap room was available so we were switched to this room. The front desk staff, a guy, was very helpful and quick. We were mighty glad and it turned out that the room was across from the Business Center. I used the Business Center and the guy in the front desk was very nice to help me connecting to my airline. He was very patience although I was not in a good mood and in pain. I was able to use the internet connection, phone to call for doctors appointment, and sent emails. It was very helpful. The room was exquisite for what I needed. It was large and very clean. The bed was so comfortable also. I slept well despite my condition. It was very quiet all night long. The shower was large and was so easy to use for someone in crutches. There was a HD TV in the room and a davenport. It was very comfortable room. This was what I needed at that time, comforts. The breakfast was also good and just right across, very near our room. They have hot and cold breakfast. I was not in the mood to have a large breakfast but I saw that it was well stocked. My husband enjoyed the breakfast. We were so slow in moving and packing that morning and was reaching the time for checkout. Although we have about 1 hour before we needed to go to the airport, we weren't ready and were slow due to my condition. I called the front desk and the staff gave us an extension to checkout from the room. She was very helpful and symphatetic. It was not easy to travel with a broken knee but the staff and accommodation of this hotel made it easier for me to go through it. The comforts that this hotel provided was priceless.

Severe storms had knocked out the phone and computer systems, but the manager and staff introduced themselves, explained the situation, checked us in, led us to our rooms and issued keys in quick time. Despite the confusion, we couldn't help but notice that the elevator doors were dirty: not just fingerprints, but hadn't-been-cleaned-in-a-long-time dirty -- inside and out. The hall carpets were really worn and dirty, with accumulated dust in the corners. We were given a room (#425) on the top floor, and upon entering, immediately remembered what had impressed us about this Hampton Inn: spacious room, with \"little extras\" beyond what you often receive in a Hampton: mini fridge, large desk and comfy chair, easy chair, and expanded bath amenities. BUT we also immediately noticed what looked to be either excessive wear or excessive dirt on the carpet. So we started to check the room out and we found the previous guest's food still in the fridge. Easily overlooked, I told myself, so my son simply called the front desk to let them know. We found the bathroom to be clean, though the finish on the wood vanity was quite worn through and not touched up or restained. At breakfast, we were pleased to find sausage patties and french toast sticks, which my kids enjoy much more than the eggs and \"breakfast pizzas\" served at most hamptons. While packing up, we discovered a pervious guest's dirty sock under the bed. This combined with the leftover food and dirty carpets in our room and dirty corridors and elevators left us feeling disappointed in just how far a property can decline in just over a year's time.
