Room itself was very modern, clean and of sufficient size (it's not huge by north american standards but decent size).

They also offer complimentary Wi-Fi which was a plus. The rooms and hallways are small and tight, but that's typicall of most buildings in Istanbul, particularly in the Pera district. We didn't have any problems with noise, but the hotel does acknowledge that it can get loud at night in the area and offers complmentary ear plugs. The rooms are basic and offers the essentials. Our only complaint is regarding the in-room safe, which is basically useless. It's very small and not attached to anything, so anybody can just carry it away if they were robbing the room (see attached pics). Overall I think the property is a good value for its price point and in a convenient location to set out to and come back from sightseeing.

I called the front desk to ask when things shut down, they replied 2:00 am. I stayed awake until 2 patient with an end in site, no such luck. At 2:45 music the same i called again. This was so loud earplugs ( the good wax kind) a scarf wrapped around my head and a pillow could not muffle it. Crazy! By 3:30 things finally quieted enough to sleep. To add insult to injury the hotel began construction work on their mezzanine at 9:00 am sat morning the next day.

We were spending close to 12-15 liras (one way) for taxi daily to get to Sultanahmet everyday. This hotel is apt if you are more into enjoying the nightlife and shopping at Istiklal street.

The entire hotel has a funky modern/ Turkish vibe to it. The turkish bath and pool in the basement is a must! Several of my friends also stayed at this hotel and we all thoroughly enjoyed the turkish bath. It's much cheaper than going to one of the tourist ones and you get a much better scrub and massage! Definately go get a bath! And the breakfast in the morning is great. Fruit, yogurt, pastries, eggs etc. You can eat on the back terrace which is one a quiet back street- just a lovely way to start the day! I have previously been to Istanbul but stayed in Sultanahmet. After staying in the Taksim area, I realize what a mistake staying in Sultanahmet was. Our hotel in Sultanahmet was much more expensive and we got much less (a sub par breakfast and yucky room!) Not only will you be constantly be bothered to buy everything and go to every restaurant- everything is at least double the price because it is tourist central. Sultanahmet is beautiful and has lots of sights and is well worth spending lots of time there. But I would highly suggest staying and eating near Taksim. Food is better and prices are much much much less! So, all in all. The Pera Tulip is definately a place to stay! I can't say enough great stuff about this hotel.

We booked our holiday way in advance when the reviews were only good ones, so we were a bit nervous when we arrived in Istanbul. We went for 3 nights (5-8 May). We did not want to stay around the Sultanahmet area because we liked the nightlife which Beyo\u00c4\u0178lu had to offer. We also knew that we would be out and about all day so we wanted a room only for sleeping. The location for us was therefore ideal. It was only 3-4 min walk to the lower end of Istiklal Caddesi. It took 15-20mins to walk up Istiklal Caddesi to Taksim (we never took the tram because it was always full). In the other direction, it took about the same time to walk down the steep hill to Galata bridge and over to Sultanahmet. The tunel station was only 3 min walk away from the hotel - ideal to avoid walking up the hill back to the hotel from Galata bridge (only 1 TL with an Abkil). The lower station is to the left when you come off Galata bridge. At night, there is an abundance of restaurants and bars very local to the restaurant and off the side roads of Istiklal Caddesi, all ranging in price to suit everyone. Quite important for us - this area serves alchohol more widely and publicly unlike Sultanahmet. Istiklal Caddesi starts to wind down from 11pm onwards as tired locals and tourists start thinning out. We also found that Istiklal Caddesi was generally more populated towards Taksim. Anyway, back to Pera Tulip. We travelled very light (one small pack back each) and we landed at Sabiha G\u00c3\u00b6k\u00c3\u00a7en Airport and caught the Havas bus which was waiting outside (they come and go every half hour direct to Taksim (13TL). It took 1 hour to get to Taksim from where we walked down Istiklal Caddesi. We turned right (past tunel station) and found Pera Tulip on a quietish road next door to the Bristol Hotel. We arrived at 4pm Wednesday where we were greeted with a smile. I was quick to ask for a room at the front (did not want to chance a back room over the restaurant). Everything went according to how it should. We were shown to the 3rd floor. My expectation of the room (standard, not executive) was that it would be small. I was right so not disappointed. My first impressions of the room was that it was decorated and furnished to a very good standard. It was clean, comfortable and everything was fully functioning. If anything, it had more to offer than what we really needed considering that we only booked it for the location/price/somewhere to sleep! So far, so good! Our first minor problem was the safe. We could not lock it because it kept coming up with a \"Motor Error\" message. 2 maintance men came up 2 mins after a quick call to reception. They couldn't fix it so said that they would have to call up the manager. Whilst waiting for him, I tried the safe again. I kept the door shut tight and then punched the code on the door. I heard the 2 metal pins being pushed out by the motor in the door and lock into the side of the safe. Job done! The 2 metal pins couldn't clear the side of the safe unless the door was held tightly shut. Anyway back to the room. Yes, it is small and therefore compact. But me and my wife were there for our 10th anniversary, so we liked the intimate and cosy feel to it. We had travelled light so we weren't going to be tripped over by our luggage. A couple with 2 large suitcases would struggle for storage. The bed was a bit small for us - sort of inbetween a British king size and single size. It was very comfortable - I'am very critical about hotel beds but we slept liked a log on this! There was a 32\" flat screen TV on the wall which was big enough for a room of this size. It had 40 channel of which maybe 5 were English spoken - we stuck to the BBC World Channel. I quite liked the bathroom door near the front door. It was glass but not transparent. Yes, there is a gap (quarter inch) all round but you still have all the privacy. Then there is the toilet and sink. Not much to say about that but my wife said she needed more light to do her makeup. Then there is another glass door which swings open into the walk in shower. The only problem here is that I used to run the shower first to get the water hot but the door would have to be open directly under the shower for me to do this so it would get wet. The walk in shower was big enough for two! We had no problems with the plumbing and the hot water could come out with a great deal of force. Looking at the pictures though, I would say that the design of the rooms vary so be careful. At night, the room overlooking the road was quiet enough for us to sleep with no traffic noise. I can't comment on the noise from the restaurant because we didn't hear anything - even at 12.30am on Saturday on our way back to our room up the staircase. Breakfast is served till 10am, though it seemed to go on till 10.30am on the first floor. The lifts (3) were slow so we always took the stairs. Breakfast is typical of the choice that you would get with nothing really missing or nothing really outstanding. You normally help yourselves to a table and get served tea or coffee. Everything else is self service. Didn't fancy the orange juice which wasn't natural. Also on the 1st floor in an adjacent room are two internet computers. The swimming pool/sauna/gym are in the basement. We paid it a visit to have a look and were very impressed but never got to used the facilities because they close it all at 9.30pm. We had an evening flight back and were told that we could keep the room at a half day rate. We choose to leave our baggage at reception instead. Upon arrival back at the hotel, we handed our ticket to the person in charge of the baggage which he then seemed to have misplaced and then he disappeared! So after 15 mins, reception let us retrieve our own baggage. We hadn't used the mini bar or the snacks in the room (there is a shop/mini supermarket next door which sells everything at a fraction of the price). We hadn't even used the tea and coffee facilities in our room which we were told were free. We never went to the main restaurant on the first floor (oddly enough, we don't even know where it is!). Before leaving, we used the toilets at the back of reception. We paid \u00c2\u00a3200 for 3 nights and our lasting impressions of the hotel would be that the decor/materials/craftsmanship was to a high standard and the customer service was above average, though maybe a greater problem during our stay may have tested that. The breakfast was ample and set us up till lunch. The location delivered exactly what we wanted during our stay in Istanbul with the infrastructure close at hand. Based on the selection in this price band, I would say that I had picked the best of the bunch. Would I go again? If I could have the same room at the same price, then yes - definitely!", "Date": "May 11, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "1", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "The Netherlands", "Title": "\u201cAvoid the first floor!\u201d", "Author": "SVDH", "ReviewID": "UR60899504", "Content": "We arrived at the Hotel Pera Tulip on Good Friday at around 4 p.m. Certainly not the last to check in we were given a room at the back on the first floor just above what we thought was only a restaurant.

The overall impression is a bit ambiguos. The whole design is very nice, everything looks stylish. But some staff attitude, the tiny and uncomfortable beds and some other things make it less special. Pros: - Good value, we paid little more than 55\u00e2\u201a\u00ac/Night for an executive room - Executive room large enough, but propably less the size of normal rooms in other hotels - Nice rooms, nice interior, nice decor, nice style, nice design - Very good location, one can walk to all the bars and clubs around Taksim square; Tram station very close by - Overall the hotel makes a good impression - Rooms were cleaned adequately daily - Spa area with pool was tiny but clean and quite nice; excellent turkish bath - Good and modestly priced massages in Spa - Nicely equipped small gym - Decent food and nice bar with piano music Cons: - Standard rooms are very small and differ in quality. When entering a standard room one immediately stands in the bathroom - Staff at the reception is friendly but very slow. For check-in and checkout you need lots of patience. At checkout the bill had to be corrected and reviewed several times due to wrong bookings (but these were definetely not on purpose). - Also some staff at the reception tends to ignore requests or wishes and just waits until the guest forgets about it (it took 2 days to get hangers in my room, also when complaining about noise I had to wait for 30 minutes and keep on asking several times before I got an answer) - Staff at the bar/restaurant is neither very professional nor friendly nor fast. Simply coffee took 30 minutes, order of a sandwich to my room, nearly 90 minutes) - As the hotel is in a lively neighboorhead with lots of bars I reckon there will be noise in summer until late - They started renovating at 8am in the room next door every day which was very annoying; as we went out a lot I would have been pleased to sleep until late - If you sleep too long, the reception WILL wake you up in any case to ask you when the room service can finally come in...I think this is very rude behaviour - The so called balcony suites are a major ripoff. Yes the balcony is nice and also they have some view, but they are way more expensive than executive rooms and way smaller...they are really small. Also they sell them for 3 people which is a huge joke, as the room is completely filled with 3 beds...no more space and luggage. - Major minus are the BEDS: horribly small (size and length) and very hard and uncomfortable. Stayed in a Radisson Blu after the trip, incredible how much of a difference a bed makes. - Some minor things that are forgiven in a 4 Star hotel but unnecessary nonetheless such as bathrobes with holes or not perfectly clean bathrooms or towels that look like they have been washed a lot and minor traps and beauty mistakes (cables behind TV look very sleazy, pieces of the wallpaper were hanging loose, on some spots some color was missing). Conclusion: I would recommend this hotel for someone who looks for value for money and some comfort in the forms of a nicely designed hotel and nice spa at a very central location.

I have been to many small hotels in all around the world but these rooms are extremely small. You cannot possibly stay in these rooms if you are a couple!

The room is tiny though, and when we walked in, we found ourselves standing in the middle of the bathroom? well the sink/ mirror is right in front of you as soon as you walk in, and the toilet is to the left, just before you enter the shower... it is very, very tiny bathroom indeed... But that is the only drawback of the hotel (but don't let that stop you). The turkish are the friendliest people you will meet in your life, and the hotel staff reflected this. The buffet breakfast is wonderful, with so much food on offer, and was definitely the best breakfast we had during our holiday in 5 cities. And the coffee at the hotel is a great kick start to the day. The staff serving breakfast are wonderful hosts, and the reception can answer any question you may have. One tip is to check out backpackerstravel, we used them to pick us up from the airport and also did a one day tour with them of the old city. Definitely worth it, the tour group only had 6 people so was very intimate and the people again are just so friendly. Also the best way to explore the area is to just get lost... we discovered some amazing places ... Check out Karak\u00c3\u00b6y G\u00c3\u00bcll\u00c3\u00bco\u00c4\u0178lu for the baklava, it is a bit of a hike from the hotel, but definitely worth it, the best baklava I've had in my life!", "Date": "December 16, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "4.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "London", "Title": "\u201cStylish modern hotel\u201d", "Author": "dabdoob", "ReviewID": "UR51014292", "Content": "Very attractive hotel.

The eventual answer after an online booking was an automatic confirmation response which caused serious discomfort: Two out of 4 booked rooms were not available at arrival. One case could be eventually settled. However, another person could not stay in the Hotel and staff did NOT AT ALL assist in finding an adequate place to stay for this person!

Additionally, the location shown on the map on the Pera Tulip website is also incorrect. A few quick facts to hopefully point you to the right location. The hotel is very close to the Tunel funicular stop. It is on Mesrutiyet just north of the intersection with General Yazgan. It is about 200m south of the Pera Palas Hotel. Neighborhood: The hotel is right next to Sofiyali Sk, which was the hippest street that we saw in Istanbul. Many nicer restaurants and bars, tables on the street, people enjoying the night. I wish we had the same kind of outdoor dining and drinking culture in San Francisco! One street over is the main pedestrian drag, Istiklal Cd, which is about 2 km long. A lot of stores on the street, but not very many notable places (Robinson Crusoe is an interesting book store, there is a shop a couple store fronts down that sells Turkish maps and ephemera, I probably missed some gold mines somewhere). Room: We stayed in 1310, which was a fair size (bigger than boutique hotel offerings in, say, New York). Two average sized adults with two average sized suitcases had plenty of space, and the room contained a double bed and a large desk. Efficient use of space, with the entryway containing the sink, mirror, and bathroom counter, toilet and shower off the entryway, bedroom straight ahead. I agree with other reviews that the glass door to the bathroom (which is not flush with the jamb) is not the most private, but not a big deal. AC worked great, flat screen tv did as well. The room did let in a bit of noise from the outside, but not enough to be an issue (and I am a light sleeper). Pool: There is a nice, decent sized indoor pool in the basement of the hotel. The hot tub was not working when we were there (and in fact, there was just some still water hanging out in there, not exactly attractive). The sauna is on the small side. Did not try the hamam services. Breakfast: I really enjoyed breakfast in Turkey, and I think the breakfast at the Pera Tulip is on the upper end.

A short walk from this hotel and you are among great restaurants, cafes and bars and then Istiklal Avenue (the famous walking boulevarde). It is very easy and relatively quick to get to the Old Town via public transport using the famous Tunel Funicular and then the tram. As everyone notes the rooms are very compact and so if you have a lot of luggage you do need to be inventive about storing it to leave enough room to walk around in. We arrived at 7.00am and the hotel allowed us to check-in straight away which was fantastic after our 10 hour overnight flight. Similar to another review the room was hot. We were told by the management that the central a/c system for the hotel had been set to HEAT as it was cold at night and that it could not be adjusted for individual rooms. They did provide us with a very powerful fan. Breakfast was fantastic and over the 5 days we stayed was quite varied. Staff were nice and helpful. Internet in the business lounge was speedy. Staff were friendly and helpful.

It is located close to the more famous Pera Palace hotel, which is closed, and over shadows the area, making it something of a building site. This is a trendy looking modern hotel, so had lots of good features, although the biggest disappointment was the room size and no views at all. I expected small, after reading the reviews but even for me, I thought the rooms were too small. I'm only just over 5 feet and still I felt cramped, given this was meant to be a 4 star hotel, and I paid a 4 star price, the lack of more spacious rooms, meant this hotel really didn't qualify for 4 stars. Everything else was fine, the staff appeared cold in the first instance, but were in fact very helpful, booking restaurants and explaining how to travel around was, never too much trouble for them. This hotel is tucked away behind the main shopping district in modern Istanbul, it was close to bars, restaurants, and shopping, although this isn't the main reason to come to Istanbul, it was well positioned. Transport to all of the main tourist attractions was easy from this location , without having to stay in the very , in- your- face, heart of the old town, so it was ideal for sight seeing.

This is a barely adequate two or three star hotel -- nothing exceptional. It has two tiny elevators that barely hold four persons each. This contributed to \"luggage congestion\" when the luggage for the 43 people on the tour was delivered. Our room was tiny with little space for luggage. The bathroom sink was actually in our room by the entry door. The remainder of the bathroom appeared to have been designed by an architectural student with no relevant experience. The toilet was behind a transluscent glass door that had at least a half inch of space all around with no jamb or latch. The shower was in a simalr compartment beyond the toilet, This was obviously done to minimize the space required for the bath facilities. The shower was good though. The room was hot and the central A/C was not on so we used the window to try to cool the room. Since there was no breeze, we initially had to keep the door open to provide enough cross ventilation to cool the room somewhat. The dinner on the first night was good as was the wine list . Similarly, the breakfast buffet had nice selections and was good. The location of the hotel was pretty far from the old section of Istanbul where most of the interesting sites (Topkapi Palace, Blue Mosue, Grand Bazaar, Spice market, and others) are located. It is, however, several blocks from a pedestrian-only street with many restaurants and shops. We stayed several extra days in istanbul beyond the end of the tour and taxiied over to the Apricot Hotel for the remainder of our Istanbul stay (see review of the Apricot Hotel).", "Date": "May 16, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "Thessaloniki, Greece", "Title": "\u201cLIES, lies, lies!\u201d", "Author": "Steli0s", "ReviewID": "UR29118428", "Content": "We are 4 tourists from Thessaloniki-Greece and we visit Istanbul many times per year.

Hotel staff were friendly and helpful. The hotel common area/piano bar was very comfortable and tastefully decorated. The sauna, gym, and pool, although small, are a plus to have after a long day on your feet, these are all free for guest use and there is a small, comfortable sitting area as well between the sauna and pool area where you can have tea and watch TV on the nice flat screen they have there. It must also be mentioned that these areas are kept VERY clean, which made it all the more comforting. Although on the smaller side, the room was classic cool with flat screen TV, electronic safe and minibar. Breakfast buffet included, however it's the one thing that could use some improvements, there needs to be some more variants and the breads were hard, seemed almost stale.

We arrived at the Pera Rose at approx. 3pm and decided to take a nap after getting up at 4am for our flight from Gatwick. Our nap-idea was short lived however due to the building going on next door...all day and all night...until 4am. After not sleeping for most of the night, we spoke to reception and told them that we would be checking out due to the excessive noise. At this point the night manager very nicely offered us a room at the Pera Tulip for the remaining 4 nights at the same price, which we gladly accepted. We were put up in an executive room on the 6th floor with a balcony with view of the Goldern Horn and blissfully no buidling site next door :-) The room was relatively large, very modern and bright, with a comfy bed (although my husband says it was too short for him). The bathroom was similarly modern but had a few problems. Firstly it smelt quite damp, this was better as our stay went on but was pretty noticeable initally. The bathroom had a large bath, however the shower had basically no water pressure, which meant we mostly had bathes. This didn't bother us so much as we were in Istanbul on holiday however if I stayed here for business and needed a quick shower I wouldn't be so happy! In addition, the bathroom doesn't have a proper door, just a glass partition-type door. Again this didn't bother us but just make sure you're prepared to get to know your travel partner well. Breakfast and service were both fine. One other slightly odd point was that the hotel does not have an iron! Not a huge problem for us but might be for some people. Location-wise the hotel is perfect, close to so many great restaurants and bars and easy to travel to all the main tourist sites.
