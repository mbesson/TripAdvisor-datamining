I stayed here last year when it was Quality Inn and it was horrible. There are new owners and it looks like most of the renovations are complete. The picture DOES NOT look like the motel. The motel looks better. I had great service and my room was excellent. I guess this place has been a \"work in progress\" over the last year and it has been paying off. Breakfast was good. Only thing that stood out was a waffle machine. Everything else was the usual for motel breakfasts The actual design of the breakfast room was impressive. Internet signal was above par compared to other motels Ive stayed at. Definitely high speed but I did have trouble figuring out how to enter the password. Location is hard to get to off the freeway the first time but still in a good neighborhood. Overall, I am very impressed. I would stay here again.

Well we now know why that was said! It was because our stay would be a nightmare!! We stayed here last year, when it was Quality Inn, and loved it, that's why we came back, but we will NEVER stay here again!! First thing we encountered was ANTS! Tons of them in our room! Every day there was another huge trail of them all up and around the bathroom door!! We called the manager and he came down with an unmarked spray bottle of unknown chemicals and sprayed the ants twice and then wiped them down with a towel! The third time we complained, he handed the spray bottle to my husband and had us spray them down daily, wiping them down with one of our guest towels!!!! The chemical smell triggered my asthma so I ended up missing two days of the con, due to having to get breathing treatments every 4 hours!! The ants were everywhere after we started spraying! You would open your laptop, on the desk by the door, and ants would be crawling across the screen! You would wake up in bed with ants crawling on the sheets! OMG it was AWFUL!!! So was housekeeping! She would take our towels and washclothes and NOT leave clean ones behind!! We had to start leaving notes on the bed for her to bring us towels and my husband even had to go to the front desk for some as well! The hairdryer blew cold air and the last day that we were there, it died completely!! We told the woman at the front desk ALL of this when we were checking out and she just shrugged her shoulders. Her attitude was the same as his!! I reported it to corporate on the way to the airport the morning we checked out, yes I was that upset! I did not even wait to get home to call! Corporate said the manager had 72 hours to respond. Well this morning I got an e-mail offering me 25% off rack rate on our next visit! HA!! Forget that!! We will NEVER stay there again!!

Ice machine was out of order the entire stay. It appeared that half the hotel was under renovation-rooms empty with no curtains. The problem came after the first night. In the morning I got in the shower around 9:40 am to get ready to go to an appointment and when I was lathered with soap the water was turned off for repairs. I called the front desk and she said it would be 5 minutes. I called 15 minutes later and she said it would be 15 more minutes.

I told her I was going to miss an appointment if they didn't turn the water back on. 10 minutes later I called the desk and asked the woman to be realistic and tell me exactly when I could expect the water back on and she said 30 minutes. I told her that I have dried soap all over me and I will have missed my 11:00 appointment. I told her that I needed to check out and go to a hotel that had water. She told me that I should be more concerned about their problems and that I had already paid for the upcoming night (2 nights) and basically it was a done deal. I advised her that my concern was my own travel and appointment agenda that their problems are not my concern. As I was packing up to leave, the water came on. My 11:00 appointment had been missed, but I had time to make a 1:00 appointment so I did not check out. I was too busy to check out and continued with the rest of my business. The second night I was kept awake until about 2:00 a.m with a rapper type music pounding the wall. This hotel is a low budget hotel, good for those on a tight budget, but not good if you have a demanding schedule. Also, do not expect professional conduct from the hotel management and concern for the customer. The correct thing would have been for the hotel to apologize and offer to only charge for the first night if I needed to check out for lack of water-which is what I was only legally responsible for anyway.

Now, I work in a job that requires me to travel alot and stay in a lot of \"budget\" hotels, from Sonoma County to Ventura (and everywhere in between), so I KNOW first-hand the nightmares budget travelers face, but I'd had better luck with Quality Inn's over, say, Motel 6's, so I thought I'd give this place a shot. When I was doing my homework, I only found a Motel 6 and a couple of non-franchise hotels in the same area for cheaper (and even then no more than $10.00 a night cheaper). While it is indeed dated, this place was DEFINITELY worth the extra ten bucks. The breakfasts were good (do-it-yourself waffle iron, cereals, fruits, toasts, muffins, etc.). The neighborhood was quiet and not at all \"shady.\" Really great freeway access, but honestly a little difficult to get to the FIRST time (and if any of you have older GPS maps, please note that the freeway exit directions may have changed since your last update). You know when you stay in a budget hotel for the first time, and when you get to the door and prepare to open, you begin dreading the smell? Because some budget hotels smell alright, while others give you that face full of funk when you open the door? I was relieved to find our room smelled fresh and clean (actually clean, not air-freshener over crap clean). Service was friendly with only mis-step: I came down for breakfast one morning right after I rolled out of bed, and my hair admittedly looked like a bird's nest (the trench coat probably didn't help either). When I walked in and asked where the breakfast bar was, the receptionist eyed me suspiciously and asked \"You ARE a guest hear, right?\" Tacky, sure, but somewhat understandable. Otherwise, the service was great for all days I stayed hear. Internet access/speed was adequate and consistent all the way through. Room's were always well cleaned between days.
