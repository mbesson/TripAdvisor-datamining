We booked one triple and one double room and because we have asked for our rooms to be next to each other, they prepered 2 triples for us (without extra charge). -High Tech Hotel: This hotel is one of the high tech hotels and it means you have free access to internet, there is a laptop in every room and there is a printer at the front desk and they won't charge you for using it. -Staff: The staff are the best possible collection of nice, helpful, friendly and polite people. They really made us feel like home. We had several requests during our stay and they were all perfectly done. -Rooms: Both rooms were big enough, clean and comfortable, and the bathrooms were very clean. -Location: The location is perfect. It's a 15 minute walk to puerta del sol and a 10 min to Gran via avenue. The neighborhood is safe and suitable for a family. There are many bars and cafes around. Once I stayed in a hotel in puerta del sol, but I prefered this one because it's out of city center's crowded streets, yet it's only a walk away. -Check-out: The check out is at 12 but they let us stay until 1, and then they kept our luggage in a room so we could enjoy the rest of the day before leaving the city at 5. Cons: There was really nothing to complain about. The only thing was that we had attic rooms (as they explained that most of the triples are in the 4th floor). So the room just had a small window (it wasn't an issue since the room is perfectly bright with the lights) and also it made the rooms seem smaller and you may bump your head against the ceiling.

He refused to honor my Expedia booking, because he claimed his \"colleague\" who had taken my information had no authority to do so. Awkward! He was the only one in the hotel that was nasty, others were mostly cordial, though not knowledgable or helpful. Receptionist in charge of our airport transportation at departure wouldn't give us the time of day when the cars didn't turn up 30 minutes past the scheduled time. Had no apology, no recourse and couldn't be bothered once we'd settled the bill. (In hind sight this could be because we're non white. Spain is beautiful, but we were sometimes taken for \"Gypsies\" who have been persecuted and segregated in Europe for centuries. That could also be the reason that several Spanish locals at were rude to us). Breakfast china was very dirty both days that we ate, with coffee residue in cups, and food remnants on silverware. AT 9 Euros a person, it wasn't worth the skimpy selection, lack of refills for yoghurt, eggs, fruit, or cheese. The only thing that there was abundant of, was ham! We resorted to going down the road to a local bakery, for 6 Euros a person, we had excellent coffee, and fair breakfast foods... Bedroom had no mirrors....aside from one in the bathroom. It was inconvenient to have three people share one mirror. Positive- Complimentary computer in every room so that we could do our own research when we needed to, and check our emails etc. Bathroom was clean, clean towels etc. Hotel is energy efficient. Close proximity to Metro (Tribunal and Alonzo Martinez), the Metro in Madrid is very clean, very convenient. Taxis are cheaper if you are more than 3 people..and taxi drivers are very helpful and honest. Plaza Santa Barbara is not as noisy as many other areas of Madrid, and still close enough to all the attractions and life of this amazing city.

This stylish, boutique hotel is well located in a pleasant area (Plaza Santa Barbara) right next to Alonso Martinez metro station. Only 5 minute walk to Chueca and 10 minute walk to the Gran Via shopping strip. The room is spacious, clean and modern; containing a large bathroom and shower. The only minor quips are that the room is missing some basic but useful things such as box of tissues, soap holder, and there\u2019s a lack of drawers on either side of the bed or desk where you\u2019d expect there to be; however there\u2019s plenty of room to place your belongings otherwise. Also, as odd as it sounds, the furniture had a lot of sharp corners so beware when moving around the room. Free wi-fi throughout the hotel and a Sony Vaio laptop with internet in the room is a nice bonus. And the welcome notes and chocolates were a nice touch.

We were a little hesitant when we made the reservation, since the hotel had just opened in mid-July and there were virtually no reviews or other feedback. We were very pleasantly surprised. Thus, let me try a \u201cplay by play\u201d description before it fades from memory\u2026.. The Santa Barbara is a very modern 4-star hotel, still with some elements of \u201cwork in progress\u201d (an extra elevator being built, etc.) but completed for all practical purposes. We were given a triple-room (406), facing the street but in the highest floor. We were not affected by the noise, yet the attic-style window did not allow for too much of a view (I understand that they have other triples with full-fledged windows). The space was very adequate (not enormous, but not tiny a la London, either). It allowed for ample space to walk around for the three of us. The bathroom was quite modern with a glass-enclosed shower (with fancy side showers as well, although you have to figure out that they are there and how they work by yourself). The water pressure was sufficient. The glass door to the bathroom, however modern, may be fine for a double room for a couple but falls short in securing a sense of privacy in the bathroom of a triple room with three adults. I would advice installing a good ol\u2019 fashioned wood door, even if it slightly \u201cmesses up the style\u201d.: ) All beds were quite solid (as we like them, although some people could find them too hard), and the in-room safe deposit box could comfortably accommodate a laptop computer. The room is outfitted with a laptop computer as well as free wi-fi for your own. This arrangement came quite handy to accommodate multiple guests in a triple room. The place was very clean, the rooms were serviced satisfactorily every day. The desk staffs were very correct and courteous without becoming annoyingly obsequious. Although the reception desk seemed to always have customers, they nevertheless took the time to give us indications to restaurants, to move around town, to secure a taxi back to the airport, all without any attitude. Our rate included full breakfast and the buffet hot and cold choices, while not decadent or exuberant, were quite adequate for us to last us until the typical 2 PM Madrid lunch hour. Do not despair if you don\u2019t get breakfast, since there are plenty of bars and caf\u00e9s all around the area when you can be like the locals and have your caf\u00e9 con leche plus croissant for about 2 to 3 euros. As to the \"negatives\" (if you must insist on a \"balanced\" view....): I cannot think of its location as a negative, although some people insist on being on top of the action and this hotel is not on top, yet It is not far removed either. It is located in Plaza Santa Barbara, in the La Chueca neighbourhood, surrounded by caf\u00e9s, bars, little shops, grocery stores, gay bars, you name it, it is there. It is 1 block away from the metro station and the main buses, and about a 10 minute walk to the Gran Via, 15 minute walk to Puerta del Sol, and 20 minute walk to the Museo del Prado. We were very happy every night to come back to the quiet of our hotel and not be in a room deep in the noise of the above areas. In summary, the Santa Barbara is a very good all around hotel, its triple room being a great value for the money at Euro 95 per night with breakfast (I am afraid that this rate will not last as the hotel becomes more established), and I would have no problem staying there again. If the administration can successfully maintain the level of service and quality, this hotel will become a very solid player in the Chueca barrio.", "Date": "September 12, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Sant Quirze del Valles, Spain", "Title": "\u201cExcellent new hotel in all aspects\u201d", "Author": "travelBCN", "ReviewID": "UR117793169", "Content": "Decided to go to this new hotel because of the good reviews in tripadvisor but a bit afraid because the small amount of them, but I'm very happy of my selection and I'll be back, as far as they keep prices in the current range, in all my future and usual visits to Madrid.
