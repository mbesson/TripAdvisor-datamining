When I first arrived my first impression was that the furniture looks old but the room and bathroom were clean with the basic stuff that I needed. It was fair enough for the price I am paying. From the first day of my stay, I realized I have made the right choice by choosing this place. The staff were incredibly nice and helpful. At first the owner was so patient guiding me how to get to any location. On next day, when I was leaving to the conference the owner told me that he can drop me at the conference! I never expected this generosity! When I asked the owner's wife about a nearby discounted store, she said that there is one nearby but there is another one better that is a bit far. She said she and her husband can drive me to there! Not only they did so but also they bought me a wonderful dinner on the way back. During my stay there, I felt I am home, and the owner, his wife and the rest of the staff made me feel home and whenever I need any help they were there for me. Let me talk about the room itself. The room was satisfactory for me. I had comfortable bed and the bathroom was clean. At first some of the furniture looked a bit old but on the third day of my stay they replaced the old study tables and chairs with new ones. There was free internet which was important for me. The complementary breakfast was also good: loaf, cereal, jam, better, milk, coffee, tea, and fruit drink. There was no safety deposit box in the room, but I could safely leave my money in an envelope with the hotel staff at the reception as the owner advised me to not carry lots of money around. The motel location was great. I had to walk for about 5 minutes to get the metro station from which I needed about 15-20 minutes to get to Hollywood and Universal City! Macy's was only few minutes walk from the hotel and there were many restaurants and shops nearby. The motel is on the main road so I felt safe walking at night though it was quiet at night at the block of my motel so I tried to be back before 9 pm as I was by myself in LA. In general I was very satisfied with my stay and the friendly staff made me feel home! I will definitely get back to stay there again if I have to get back to LA! I would love to say big thanks for the owner and his wife for their incredible generosity and hospitality!", "Date": "March 27, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "2", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Sleep Quality": "2", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Melbourne, Australia", "Title": "\u201cOnly as a last resort\u201d", "Author": "runawayvespa", "ReviewID": "UR99952536", "Content": "I have very low standards when it comes to hotels and I was prepared to give this place a chance after reading the reviews. I was staying in LA for a week, but I only booked my first night here to see what it was like. After one night I left and paid slightly more for a nicer hotel down the road. What turned me off was the rooms are old, rundown and in need of renovation. The bathroom in particular was old and felt dirty. There was no mould in the bathroom, but the tiles were stained and I didn't want to touch anything. The facilities in the rooms were functional and basic. Rooms were a decent size, the internet was fast and the bed was reasonably comfortable. We didn't encounter bedbugs, which was a plus. The rooms were noisy - we were woken constantly during the night by other guests arriving and someone having coughing fits. The man who greeted us when we arrived was curt, but other staff seemed nice. We didn't swim in the pool but it looked clean. The free parking was convenient. I wouldn't go back to stay unless the hotel underwent a major renovation.", "Date": "March 13, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Sleep Quality": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Schwaig, Germany", "Title": "\u201chorror of motel\u201d", "Author": "alfred067", "ReviewID": "UR69700071", "Content": "This was the worst choice of motel based on their web page.

On arrival we quickly discovered that our swimming costumes would not get much use as the pool looked like something that would house the lockness monster!! sorry did you say pool on the internet site or swamp?? if we did manage to fish the floating rats out of the pool im pretty sure we would of still had trouble getting passed the plastics bags and beer bottles!!! Also advertised on the site was everyone gets the use of a microwave, i cant fault this discription as we did get the use of ONE MICROWAVE that was conveniently placed on a plastic garden table outside by the swamp...yes..yes thats right i did say outside!.. As we entered our room we soon realised that when they said the room was air conditioned it meant a broken window that provided us with a lovely LA breeze all night long. I really admired the attention to detail that was put into the city center motel as they took the time and effort to go around with an iron making lovely marks in the whole carpet. The bathroom was ok if you dont mind showering with ants and your about 3ft tall as the shower head was soo low down. When night time arrived we switched on the light as it was getting dark and wasn't suprised when the light bulb wasn't just any light bulb it looked very much like a light designed for attracting mosquitoes. After a long night sleep we were very hungry and was looking forward to the free continental breakfast, so we got up in search of the breakfast lounge. After searching and having no luck we went into the office asking the wherabouts of the lounge. She pointed to the back of the reception room at a medieval toaster, a bag of bread and a coffee pot that we thought was safe to ignore. Overall the motel was disgracefull and we found the best way to deal with the situation was to get blacked out drunk so you dont have to worry about what may be in your bed with you!! Dont read this and just think that i am being a prude as i have done alot of budget travelling around America staying in cheap hostels that cost as low as $10 a night and they are a million times better that this motel. I would definitely advise to pay the extra $20 for a night in a better hotel or save your money and sleep on the street.", "Date": "April 12, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Europe", "Title": "\u201cLooks are deceiving.\u201d", "Author": "SpiderJerusalem", "ReviewID": "UR50717585", "Content": "I'll admit. My first impression of the City Center wasn't great. Over twenty hours on a plane didn't help that. It's not the best looking motel I've seen, and while it certainly isn't a Trainspotting style nightmare, you shouldn't be expecting The Hilton. The pool remains a mystery to me and I haven't even gone near it on my trip. But here's the thing. When travelling on a longer trip where a really high priced hotel would kill my budget, I've found that the City Center was a great choice to stay at. The reason? It has some of the most hospitable owners that I've ever met. From the first day that I had arrived I was treated with the utmost courtesy and friendliness. Whether it was me asking for directions or a place to eat at odd hours, they were more than happy to help me - often in ways I wouldn't have even expected. When my friends came to visit me on my birthday, the owners had actually arranged for a cake to the lobby with my name on it. I can't tell how genuinely surprised and happy we were at such an effort made by people still almost complete strangers. They are located at the heart of downtown, just a block away from the main stores and restaurants in the area. Travelling from there to almost anywhere is made incredibly easy by the metro system and public transit. The owners are also more than willing to arrange for shuttles and cabs to help you on your way. If you own or have rented a car, their parking area is very safe and always has room. Over the month and half that I stayed at City Center I had no problems with my room, which was more than adequate to my needs. Yes, they're not the easiest on the eyes, but the beds are very comfortable, the room service and cleaning in thorough and over the month the owners have been making a constant effort to spruce up the outlook of the entire location. And if I had anything to comment on, any information to ask, the owners never let me down. On my first weeks to the area, I was completely lost driving and owning a car in the city. When mentioning this to owner he provided me with a slew of helpful information and, most importantly, reassuring words that helped me greatly adjust to the environment and car culture in the area. I would like to extend a very warm thank you to the owners of City Center. It has it's rough edges, but it is run by genuinely nice, open and honest folks who really seemed to care my stay was good. While in a city where image is everything the motel could do with some interior and exterior decorating, what really matters is that you feel welcome and a valued guest.
