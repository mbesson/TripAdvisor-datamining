I really liked the setup of having 2 floors in my room, what an excellent use of space ( though I didn't like having to walk down the steps to use the bathroom in the middle of the night !). Enjoyed being right on Nathan road, the street is bustling till midnight daily, lots of options for food and shopping. The only bad thing was the rotten fruit they serve in the rooms, and I mean rotten apples, which clearly are recycled from guest to guest.

Room : Good Fully equipped for fundamental features.

We were a bit sceptical because of some negative reviews on TripAdvisor but found everything to be simply great. Firstly, the location of this hotel cannot be overstated, it is right on top of the Jordan MTR, down a few flights of escalators, if you are carrying bags of loot from your many shopping trips around HK, there is nothing better than being only 1-2 minutes from your room after you get off the MTR, amazing. Yes the escalators do stop at 11pm, so either time your arrival night just before then, or just deal with it ! If you arrive on a very late flight, use the concierge entrance just around the south corner of the building and they will handle the bags for you. But a few tips are needed about check in, if you arrive on the #21 bus from the airport (only 33 HK$) and get off in front of the hotel, dont walk down the big central set of steps to access the escalator, just take the small set of steps going up to the right, they lead straight to the Concierge desk on the right , and dont criticise the hotel for the security guards' lack of English, they work for the shopping complex, not the Prudential Hotel. Staff were as friendly and helpful as they could be, always quick with a smile, knew everything we needed to know, quick to help with bags etc, as good as any hotel we have stayed in. And their English was very good. We had requested several things by email and were always answered in minutes, so on arrival we had a room high up and facing Nathan Rd. We tried as much as possible on this trip to be totally devoid of phones, Facebook and email, so were not concerned about internet access, on the last day we used the business centre for a few minutes to confirm flight details and contact family, all for a small charge. In spite of the lobby renovations going on we were not the slightest bit bothered, check in-check out time was only a few minutes, and their are a ton of cheap eats all around the hotel, also found a cheap laundry just behind the hotel which we used every few days. Only a few minutes walk to Temple St night market, still a great place to visit, browse, haggle, or just people watch, and 2 MTR stops to Ladies market, much larger but much much more crowded.

The Temple Street market is a 5 to 10 minute walk away, with plenty of local places to eat everywhere you walk, and there is another small market right across the street.

Rooms: The room I was in was spacious with a chaise and little work desk. I think I was upgraded, I also had a glass portal that jutted out from the building, which gave me a nice view up and down Nathan Road. I got a decent price booking through Agoda, about USD$175 per night: I could have saved a few bucks going to a lower end hotel, but I wanted clean and safe, so went with this one for a few dollars more. I was on a non-smoking floor (11th) and the room appeared to have been newly renovated, it was spotlessly clean with a comfortable queen (or king?) bed (I thought it felt firm, but slept like a baby on it). Plenty of room, nice strong shower, good toiletries. The front desk will provide a power adaptor at no charge. Lobby: Lobby was ok as a temporary fix due to renovations at the time of my stay, reception is on the second floor with escalators taking you up, there are a few bellboys at hand to bring your luggage up for you (they also deliver straight to the room after you check in so you don't have to lug them up the escalators, no charge unless you want to tip). As mentioned, there were renovations going on during my stay, but unless you're planning on hanging out in the makeshift lobby for prolonged periods of time, there should be minimal impact on your stay. There is a small temporary business center (1 computer, three chairs) tucked away in the corner of the lobby. Amenities: Basic gym on the upper floor, I think there was a pool too although I did . There is also a rooftop observatory for a view of the surroundings. There is also an on-site restaurant with an extensive menu. You pay for internet in the room, USD$3 for 30 minutes, with marginally better rates as you buy more time (although beware, once you log out, your time keeps rolling so you have to use it all at once). Staff: Staff were always friendly and helpful. Getting there: You can take a train, taxi or shuttle. I wasn't in the mood to get lost in Hong Kong or to experiment with the subway / train system, so I got the shuttle bus from the airport to the hotel for about USD$13 each way (second passenger USD$10), well worth the 60 to 90 minute ride in my opinion for door-to-door service. You'll probably pay somewhere around USD$50 or USD$60 for a regular cab ride door-to-door. Random tip: I didn't have very long in HK, so I took an organized tour (not usually the preferred option) with Gray Line tours; there is lots to see and plenty of driving between sights, but the deluxe tour with lunch on the biggest floating restaurant in the world was nice, and took the better part of the day, although it can get you back in time to see the city lights laser show at 8pm with time to spare. They pick you up and drop off at your hotel. Base price is something like USD$71, but expect to pay about USD$90 or USD$100, which covers the extra activities (short boat ride, photo taken of you at the tram station overlooking HK, tip, etc).

We then proceeded to check in and the queues were very busy with one line feeding the check in staff. This line was managed by a man - who again was most officious. We arrived at the check in counter and a young lady (I think Jen or Jin) started to process us.... and I will say process - she could not look up to greet us, everything was just routine and totally inpersonal. My first impression of this hotel is not good and we were not made welcome at all. I found it odd too that it appeared that the swimming pool was closed every day over the lunch break \"for cleaning\" for me personally - a time I would most likely use the pool. I can only commend the room attendants who always said good morning and were courteous. The hotel is dated, the rooms naturally small (it is Hong Kong)- and in terms of cleanliness - OK.

This time, I was surprised when I stepped inside the room that it was much smaller than the room offered to us before. The room offered to us 2 years ago was a much bigger room - probably the superior as it was really spacious. Their standard room was small - internet information indicate it was 40 sq. m but I'm sure the information wasn't updated. The standard room was probably around 25 sq. m. The room was still clean, but the cabinet was really small. The couch had a large stain and the bathtub and toilet bowl were clean but there were stains that couldn't be removed. Bathroom amenities were also \"downsized\". There was also this \"cabinet\" on the wall behind the bedside table which had a lock (probably a switch of some sort inside since the elevator was located just outside our room) and there was this gap between the top of the door and the wall which was unsightly. The TV had only 2 english channels, I think and no disney or children's channel. Overall, the room is clean and comfortable, but it wasn't what I expected as the first time I stayed there I was really impressed. This time, you could see there are some wear and tear and maybe they would need a bit of repairs here and there. Last time we also had bathrobes and and iron - but this time there were none. There was also smoke smell inside the room when we returned to the hotel - and ours was a non-smoking room on a non-smoking floor. THe hotel staff said it was probably due to the airconditioning - some guests somewhere might have been smoking inside the room and brought the smoke smell to our room. The next day housekeeping did spray some airfreshener to clear up the bad smell. Nothing beats the location of this hotel though. It's absolutely great! The MTR is just below the hotel and there is a mall as well. Staff were efficient and housekeeping were very helpful. There was this concierge though when we were checking out who refused to help us with our bags - We had to carry them to our bus as the travel agent was waiting to take us to the airport.

Right from the moment we arrived the staff couldn't have been more attentive. The entire hotel was spotless and we found it totally faultless. Breakast was included in our tariff and was a great start to the day. We didn't have evening dinner in the hotel but ate twice at the restaurant in the basement just before entering the Jordon MTR. We had a Duplex Suite and appreciated complimentary bottled water replenished daily. A real treat was the bottle of wine and fruit platter that was a gift from the hotel. The bed was ultra comfortable, bathroom light and bright and generously stocked with lovely products. Lots of lamps and good lighting. Two tellies. We had a view of other buildings but then Hong Kong comes alive with fabulous lights at night so the view was more than agreeable for us, especially the first night when the weather gave us a fork lightning show. Free unlimited broadband was welcome and efficient. It is centrally located on Nathan Road, and right above the Jordon MTR station. It's easy to get to from the airport. Just get the A21 bus right outside and literally get off at the door. We'd recommend buying an Octopus card at the airport. You can use it on trains, buses, ferries, MTR underground tubes and the Ding Ding tram, plus a few select shops. The markets are fun and we enjoyed the jade market. Highlights (of various sorts) of our holiday were Ocean Park where you can see Pandas. The old walled Kowloon City, and not forgetting being treated to a bit of Typhoon Koppa! The Museums are rich in history and very interesting. One thing that won't interest everyone but it's a nice trip out in the New Territtory to the Kaldoorie Farm and Botanical Gardens. Expansive gardens of huge altitude but an incredibly peaceful place. If you're fit and active, something to consider. We enjoyed our holiday in Hong Kong and this definitely won't be our last one there.

We had stayed on Lantau Island going over and had 5 nights here returning to Sydney. We took the A21 bus as advised, only HK$cheap and stops right outside-walk straight ahead and take the 1st turn left [we had to ask someone] the hotel concierge desk is up about 6-7 steps. A porter took our luggage, gave us a receipt and directed us up to the Reception-a VERY small area. Check in was fairly straightforward-I\u2019d prepaid .Luggage delivered to our Deluxe non smoking room very promptly. The room was fine-looked exactly like the hotel picture. Fairly spacious, A/C worked-it was very hot while we were there,fridge,coffee making. A fruit platter delivered on the 1st evening. It was right next to the lift-which was noisy after a while, avoid the lift. WIFI was included, not breakfast-there were so many eateries around that we never ate in the hotel at all, so I can\u2019t comment on that. The pool was closed the 1st 2 days because of a typhoon warning-DH had a few dips after that-he said was fine. What had sold me the most on this place was the location-over the Jordan MTR. That actually was not a great bonus because, there were so many escalators [6 I think ] to reach Reception-all going through the Mall, it was really slow,and tiresome. And worst of all-the escalators from Jordan were closed from 10.00pm until 10.00 am. Then, the station had to be reached by going out the concierge exit onto the street and walking to the next entrance. Tourists are likely to go out early, and return late,so location location-evaporated. We used the bus more than the MTR in the end. Octopus card in hand at all times. It was very handy to the Temple St market-we had dinner there 3 nights. Unfortunately, the end of our trip was spoiled because I was ill [not food poisoning] we were not flying out until midnight the last day, and were not able to complete our plans. My husband asked for a late check out-and they very kindly gave us until 4.00pm, the best they could do, as the hotel was full-at no charge. Which we appreciated very much.

Initially was told by an agency to get Largos hotel, which is also near the Jorden MTR, but after checking the maps, i changed my mind. I have no idea why people over at largos gave the hotel a thumbs up for location, but trust me, after a long day of shopping in hong kong, the last thing you want would be to walk all the way back to your hotel from the jorden MTR. In short, prudential hotel is simply ABOVE the MTR. Yes. Once you are back at the jorden mtr, you just need to exit and go straight up to the 5th floor and take your elevator back to the hotel. It's that fab! The cleaniness of the hotel is pretty incredible. Me and my friends are really messy people. So throughout the 4 nights at the prudential hotel, we always left it in a HUGE mess. Our clothes on the floor, things cluttered in the toilet and tables. But then everytime we got back, everything would be spick and span. They even rearranged all our toiletries, folded the discarded clothes that we threw on the beds, rearranged our luggage to accommodate more space.. I mean are they the best chamber maids or what?!! Also, the location is fantastic. Besides being above the jorden mtr, we were only one stop away from tsim tsa tsui, and 2 stops from mongkok. Plus we were surrounded by 7-elevens, and just behind the hotel is a stretch of street filled with odd shops perfect for any last minute clothing shopping. Its cheap plus, you are able to haggle for a lower price. Did i not forget to mention that the hotel is along the wonderful stretch of road called Nathan road? Just walk along it and i assure you, you'll find plenty to do and see. The area is also surrounded by many food stalls, and i would recommend getting yourself a nice roasted goose or pigeon. OR just walk over to temple street for some great food and shopping. As for the hotel room itself, i think the size is just right. The beds are comfortable, they even have bolsters provided!! Plus we got free complimentary bottled water per person every day. I'm not too sure if this is a compulsory option since my other two friends who stayed at the same hotel though 6 storeys lower, did not have any. But they did get free daily newspapers which we did not. I give this hotel 2 thumbs up.

After I did so, the new bed had hair on it, so I asked to see a manager this time and I got upgraded to the mezzanine suite, not so much of an upgrade because it was a smoking room and the mezzanine is not very convenient (I do not recommend for people with kids or old people), because you have to go up and down all the time since the bed is upstairs. Also it's very dangerous, you can hit your head very easily on those spiral stairs (which happened to one of us). The included breakfast is very average, it's good that it's included though.

The rooms were a little outdated, but the bed was the most comfortable thing we had slept on during our two week travels. The room was clean and provided incredible views off the balcony of the city. The only thing we found really disappointing was the business centre which charged was too much for only 30 minutes of internet usage. Even the wifi in the room was not complementary, it came at a charge. That was fine for us because we were not on a business trip, but those who are should be aware of the outrageous charges. If we ever head back to Hong Kong, I think we would stay here if the price was the same.", "Date": "June 21, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Seattle, WA", "Title": "\u201cIt has it all--location--large room--amenities\u201d", "Author": "Cathyecuador", "ReviewID": "UR32340030", "Content": "As a college graduation present I took my 22 year old niece to Hong Kong.

It was close enough to walk to the harbour in 20 minutes or a bour a 5 minute subway ride which was a couple bucks.

There was plenty of room for 2 suitcases and 2 can easily be in the bathroom at the same time. The restaurant was above average for breakfast but don't buy it with the hotel reservation as we got a 2 for 1 coupon once we were there. For Dinners we ate outside of the hotel as there were far too many choices for less money. We took the airport express and shuttle bus from the airport and it was a breeze. However, the ruturn trip shuttle bus does not stop at this hotel so you either have to get a taxi back to Kowloon station or right to the airport. There was four of us travelling so it was the same cost to take a taxi as it was for the epxress train. A travel note... We have discovered that the Hop On/Hop Off bus tour in all the major cities we have been to is a great way to get your bearings in a new city and from there you can jump off and on to discover your favourite areas more in depth. Also, with this pass you jump the line at the Peak tram over on the island which can save you an hour at least in a line up. Overall, we would definatley stay here again.

The upgraded room was a tad larger than a \"cozy\" room (and big by HK standards), so we were glad we got that upgrade! IWe booked a bus tour through the travel desk and it was ok. The bellhop at the ground level was the only downside of our stay. They barely understood English and grimaced at us the four times we passed by them (including arrival and departure). The station right under the hotel made it so easy to get to places anytime during the day or night. It was crowded even at nights and seemed really safe. HK TIP #1 - If you have bags, TAKE THE TAXI from the airport. We took the airbus and had to lug our bags quite a bit. It was not fun! HK TIP #2 - Very few people speak English, and no one will stop to answer your questions or help with directions.

I must say that the hotel is perfectly located to close proximity to public transport with a bus stop right outside the hotel/shopping plaza and the Jordan MTR right underneath. As previously mentioned by other guests, the best way to access the MTR is via the street entry/exit on Nathan Rd and not the Prudential Hotel entry/exit as there are about 5 levels of escalators to go up to reach the hotel entry. The deluxe room we stayed in was bigger than I expected. I have read lots of reviews of hotels and have heard that Hong Kong rooms are smaller than the average Australian hotels and I wasn't expecting that much. We had a view of Nathan Rd but surprisingly I didn't notice much noise from the traffic below, which I was a bit worried about. Though, being on the 11th floor that might of helped a bit. The room was quite clean and the beds weren't too hard by HK and China standards. We were provided with 2 complimentary bottles of water as well as some treats such as kit kats, cereal drink and a banana. The bathroom was the only disappointment as the toilet seemed to be kind of block with the water being 2/3 full (I'm not quite sure if this is a HK thing coz I found a public toilet the same way). Also, the bath was quite shallow and the shower curtain was quite dirty. The only aspect that I like was they provided toothbrushes and toothpaste, which I hadn't encountered in 4 or 5 star hotels. During our stay, we ordered room service. The service was quite efficient having our Unagi Don set served within 20 minutes. The gentleman who brought our meal was very friendly and had great manners. The food itself was beyond expectations and was just as good as how I experience it in Australia. I was disappointed in how we were offered free high speed internet only to find out this didn't include wireless (I only had my Ipod touch and weren't able to use their cable). You are able to access the wireless from your room but with an extra cost. They did however allow me to use their business centre free of charge.

We caught the Airport Express (HK$90 each) to the Kowloon station and caught a taxi to the hotel (HK$30). We didn't have to eat at the hotel but instead tried the number of small local restaurants on the side street outside the hotel - so cheap and yummy. The only disadvantage is, their English is very limited. It rained most of the week we were in HK, but because the MTR is directly below the hotel complex, we didn't have to get wet when we ventured out to our daily shopping. For those of you who haven't travelled to Hong Kong before, don't forget to get an Octopus Card which can be used on all the public transport - very convenient to use and saves so much time going on the MTR.

To get to the MTR just go down to the escalators and into the mall to level 2B or if you go outside theres an entrance across the street. But if you are going to HK to party in places such as lang kwai fong or causaway bay you might want to find a place on the other side of the island. MTR closes around 12:45am so any time after that you will have to take a taxi back to the hotel running around 80 to 100hkd ($10-15usd). This is the down side. The room looked modern to me but the walls are VERY thin. I ended up hearing little kids in the morning starting at 6am EVERY morning (im not even joking) and at night I heard people making love from ACROSS the hall. At one point there were people smoking on the non smoking floor. Originally I booked a single bed which turned out to be two twin on the first night. When asked will there be a single bed room available tomorrow, the reply was I don't know and made no effort to try to find out. We later went through a few staff between the two days before we could get the room change. They tried to offer us a room with two twin bed which they would pull together on a smoking floor with we declined. The silk throw pillows on the bed were cute until I found little unknown stains on them. The red chair in our room for the desk was BADLY stained. Overall it was simple room. Only I got a rash during my stay there. Which magically disappeared after we had left. As for people who had commented on Mong Kok be close. It is very close but if you are looking for tourist attractions such as Flower Market or Woman Market, those places closes around 11pm. We had paid around 100usd a night which you could probably find a better place just as convenient on the other island such at Metropark in Causeway or Wesley. If one is really so incline to living in Kowloon area, BP International which my mother had stayed in is suppose to be decent. I did not hear complaints of dirty linens or thin walls.

My daughter who lives in NY marveled at how superior the subway system was compared to NY. But more about the hotel...the rooms were much larger than I expected. We were told than we had been upgraded but after reading all the reviews on this hotel, we believe that they may tell everyone that and the \"superior' room we got was really no different than the \"standard' room booked. No matter, it's a nice marketing strategy and the bottom line was a room that was large enough for two women, all our luggage, multiple hair appliances and toiletries - you get the picture. The furnishings are basic and plain but comfortable and clean. About hair dryers - there is a built into the wall style dryer in the bathroom but we didn't know that and brought our own. I prefer mine anyway But even with an adaptor and transformer (best deal is Wal-Mart $19.95) the dryer did not blow at full power and weakened the longer you used it. The showers were fantastic...shower heads have quite a bit of pressure and plenty of hot water. The beds were very comfy, especially the comforters and pillows.

Much has been written about the buffet breakfast so I will also weigh in....it is $99 HK (about $12 US) and has made to order omelets, hot cereal called porridge which was a thin oatmeal - great mixed with the granola to thicken it up - toast, hot dishes, fruit, yoghurt, etc. Is it worth it? Yes if you want some American choices for your meal. You can also order off a menu which they won't offer unless you ask. I found out that if I only had oatmeal from the buffet, the a la carte menu price was $48 HK ($6 US). Some mornings we went to the Starbucks around the corner. Once we tried the close by Australian Dairy recommended in another review. For $22 HK you get a big plate of eggs scrambled or fried and 2 thick pieces of buttered toast plus a broth soup with macaroni in it. Very inexpensive and filling.

She was only enquiring about where to find restaurants with dim sum on trolley but a very unhappy staff told her off coldly that there wasn't such restaurants.

Also visited China for the day, thought we could go it alone but is very difficult getting the visa if you are not part of an organised trip so would not advise to go it alone, its also very expensive to get a visa on your own.

The hotel is great for the price, the location. This is a room for you to rest your head for the night, and get up to do explorations around Hong Kong in the morning. Easy access to the MTR station (direct exit), a well priced mall connected to the hotel, directly across from many local eats, or walk up the street to Nathan road for fancier treats. It's a very well located hotel. We got a room that faced the major street, which we liked. The Concierge Hmm... how shall I say this.... well built helpful young men who are courteous and some of them thoughtful. They are the ones who knows the tips and tricks around the city... they've seen more set ups and travel arrangements and sometimes can give you the best price to achieve your travelling goals. E.g. on our return trip planning to head to the airport, we had 6 pieces of luggage with 4 pieces being large baggage... at first I thought we would hire two taxis, get to the Airport Express, drop off the luggage for check in, then continue to cruise the city for a bit before we have to head to the Airport Express to catch our flight. The hotel concierge boys suggested that we simply take the taxi to the airport, and assured us that the taxi will take all 6 luggage\u2019s with 3 carry on parcels... for a nominal price increase but substantial improvement in comfort and efficiency. Hotel Experience with Staff In general the staff was helpful... though their hotel management policies are slightly different from the average hotel. E.g. They ask you to prepay for the full amount upfront E.g. The hotel guest must return the key to the front desk every time they leave the hotel, then retrieve the key again if you want to enter your room (we just took our key with us... no one said anything :P) I think it's to help the staff determine which guests are here and which ones are out of the building Amenities - In room Safe - key safe, free of charge, need to get key from the front desk - elevators - if you are not afraid of heights, you might marvel at the view - room light - too dim to my liking - lobby - busy, with people of all races and tours - definitely not a place to lounge. Either get in your room or go explore the city or something.... :) Other I actually went to the hotel to see the room size before checking in. The staff was very nice and showed me the room. After seeking his advice, I decided not to upgrade the room. We were able to fit three adults and 6 pieces of large luggage in the room.

I booked this hotel after reading numerous reviews on this website mainly due to its location but also because it offered a competitive price at an expensive time of year. I really think some of the previous reviewers need to realise that this is not a 5 star hotel and it doesn't pretend to be. Don't look for 5 star trimmings and you will be more than satisfied. I arrived mid afternoon on Boxing Day and checked in within less than 5 minutes. I had a comfortable room on the 11th floor with a side view of part of Nathan Road and a bed almost 7 feet wide just for me. The rooms are relatively large and maybe a little spartan but everything you need is there including a comfortable desk area. The bathroom is functional with extremely high pressure taps and my biggest gripe of all was that the liquid soap dispenser in the bath/shower was at shower level so for those of us who prefer a bath, you have to keep standing up to get to the soap! Bed linen is changed daily provided you leave a little cardboard tree in the bed and room cleaning is efficient and unobtrusive. Quite why the maids felt it necessary to switch on the air conditioner and turn it to maximum cold each day is a mystery but then Hong Kong does seem to like its air conditioning even at times of year when it is not really necessary. What the hotel does suffer from is a lack of soundproofing between the rooms and the corridors outside and as other reviewers have noted, noisy guests can be annoying especially early in the morning if you want to sleep in. There is a good restaurant serving sensibly priced buffet meals which have extensive choice together with an all day menu. Although the buffet was never cleared away before the stated closure time, there was a tendency to remove the bilingual descriptions by each item some 15 minutes before the buffet closed which meant that in some cases, one didn't know what one was eating! There is a lack of any central lounge space as the lobby is rather small and this is a pity. The location is superb with the Jordan MTR station immediately underneath the hotel and the Temple Street night market within less than 5 minutes' walk.

Overall, it's a good budget hotel.", "Date": "March 16, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "2", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "2", "Service": "1", "Rooms": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "NYC, Singapore", "Title": "\u201cWorst hotel HK\u201d", "Author": "CynWong", "ReviewID": "UR4475747", "Content": "I've stayed in quite a few different hotels in Kowloon before and by far this was the worst hotel ever. First of all, when I came out of my taxi, there was no one to help me with my suitcase. I had to carry it up the stairs past the doorman and up a narrow escalator before I reached the main lobby. The check in was ok. Staff was indifferent to my complaint about not having any help with my suitcase. The rooms were bare. Towels were extremely flimsy. The worst part is that the mattress sank a few inches when I sat on both of the twin size beds in the room. When I called to complain, they actually told me they had wooden boards available to put under the mattress!! Perhaps they should invest in real mattresses instead! It took them over an hr to come and put the boards in, and it was already past midnite after my arrival. I had to call reception 3 times. I was scheduled for a weeks stay and promptly changed hotels the next night. I ended up at the royal plaza. Paid a lot less for a much bigger room. It was a little older, but way more luxurious. I would never stay at the prudential again. I seriously recommend staying at any alternative hotels.", "Date": "February 21, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "3", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "wakefield", "Title": "\u201cGreat Hotel\u201d", "Author": "Joanna21", "ReviewID": "UR4415241", "Content": "i stayed at the hotel in March and was very impressed. The room and the bathroom were large, clean and comfy. Compared to other hotels ive stayed in this was by far the best. The view from our room was of a back street but we were to busy exploring HK to be worried about that. It was in an ideal location on Nathan road above the Jordon subway which was great. The lobby was very busy at times and was very smokey but it didnt bother us. When we arrived our cases were taken straight up to the rooms and the concierge and the reception staff could not do enough for us. we did not use the gym and the pool was closed. All in all for the price we paid (\u00a345 per night for 2 people) it was great value for money and i would certainly recommend it.", "Date": "February 5, 2006"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Prudential Hotel", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g294217-d305892-Reviews-Prudential_Hotel-Hong_Kong.html", "Price": "$136 and up*", "Address": "<address><span rel=\"v:address\"><span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">No.222 Nathan Road, Tsim Sha Tsui</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:locality\">Hong Kong</span></span>, <span class=\"country-name\" property=\"v:country-name\">China</span> </span></span></address>", "HotelID": "305892", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/02/ac/eb/65/other-hotel-services.jpg"}}
