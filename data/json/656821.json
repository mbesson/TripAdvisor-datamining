Comfortable beds, a good bath, reasonably sized rooms and an excellent buffet breakfast. We stayed only one night due to a nearly 24-hour layover and would have had no problem staying more days. The price is somewhat high but very much in-line with similar hotels.", "Date": "November 15, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Aosta, Italy", "Title": "\u201cGood hotel\u201d", "Author": "lucais", "ReviewID": "UR95263293", "Content": "I recommend this hotel to everyone. the price is very cheap. The hotel is very clean, the staff is very friendly and helpful. The breakfast is really good and plentiful. In addition, the location is optimal, is 2 minutes from the tram stop that takes you to the center in 5 minutes and the metro is also close by. I recommend it to everyone, the only flaw is the size of the room not very big, and if you can give yourselves a room not facing the street because it's noisy.", "Date": "February 2, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Vienna, Austria", "Title": "\u201cnice cheap hotel in Aksaray\u201d", "Author": "permaneworldtraveler", "ReviewID": "UR83112491", "Content": "this hotel is in a very central postition between the 2 metro-stations in Aksaray. you can go there from airport without changing the line. its in a narrow street with small local traffic. from there it takes you 15 min by tramway to the historical center. you can reach all other parts of old istanbul by feet from there. restaurants are nearby but no touristic ones. most guests are turkish. i recommend to take one of the rooms in 4th floor as theres a little view to Fatih-mosque. breakfast is buffet and you can take as much as you want. rooms are renovated new. only negative was that the TV antenna didnt work on all channels and there are no english ones. due to the lower room rates for a 3*hotel its a good deal to stay there. you are in the center but dont pay as much as in sultanahmet district.", "Date": "October 12, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Alfreton, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cClean, comfortable & convenient\u201d", "Author": "FoghornLeghorn2", "ReviewID": "UR33915663", "Content": "This was our second stay at this hotel in Istanbul, for a stay of 5 nights whilst on a 3 week holiday in Turkey. We chose this hotel again because of its excellent location in Istanbul for accessing the public transport links in the city. The hotel is within easy walking distance of the Aksaray Metro stop when coming to/from Ataturk Airport. It is also adjacent to a tram stop which takes you into Sultanhamet and other city locations. The hotel itself is a basic business-class hotel offering clean rooms (cleaned daily), spacious bathrooms and a decent buffet breakfast. Having travelled around Turkey, we found the breakfast offered a wider selection than other hotels including a hot dish, yoghurt, a cereal, fresh bread, cakes, plus the ubiquitous cucumber, tomato, olives, watermelon, meats, cheeses and jams/honey. Drinks offered included a selection of teas, instant coffee, squash or milk. If you want to see the city from a convenient location at a reasonable price (100YTL/\u00c2\u00a340 prpn), this hotel is ideal. However, if you want the ambience of a romantic getaway then we would suggest you look elsewhere.", "Date": "July 5, 2009"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Bern Otel", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g293974-d656821-Reviews-Bern_Otel-Istanbul.html", "Price": "$72 - $115*", "Address": "<address><span rel=\"v:address\"><span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">Millet Cd.
