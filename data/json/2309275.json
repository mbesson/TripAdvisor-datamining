We were staying in the one bedroom which was compact especially with a baby however was suitable, I would if possible stay in the larger rooms available as they have a bathroom and more space. The staff at The Forest by Wangz were fantastic better than fantastic they went above and beyond to help and make you feel as comfortable as possible (a home from home) We will definitely be staying there again and would recommend to anyone. I found the location acceptable for my situation they had a daily shuttle bus available and also the hotel was very close to the MRT and supermarket.", "Date": "April 13, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Forks, Washington", "Title": "\u201cVery very Nice!\u201d", "Author": "IsabellaSwan22", "ReviewID": "UR126677013", "Content": "Very friendly and courteous staff, everything was nice and clean. It was very comfortable with the lockers and cabinets, we had a lot of space to store. Ironing board and iron right in the closet and even the hair dryer has not been lacking. Also very convenient because of the kitchen and co. if you can not eat outside its possible cook for your self. Good location, just 5 min to the MRT. Very high recommended. :) Pool was not so private because of a corridor, people who pass can see the whole pool area. Maybe should be covered a bit so you have more privacy while you schwimming.", "Date": "March 26, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cHospitality\u201d", "Author": "DaruPrakoso", "ReviewID": "UR125478615", "Content": "I feels like home here..I can relaxed my mind and enjoy my stay here,their service never failed me", "Date": "March 1, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Finland", "Title": "\u201cThe best possible start to life in Singapore\u201d", "Author": "SS_Finland", "ReviewID": "UR125227532", "Content": "We relocated to Singapore in February 2012.
