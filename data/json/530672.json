{"Reviews": [{"Content": "good experience I booked it through Wotif.com, and after reading some mixed reviews about this hotel, i booked it anyway.I must say that my review will be a bit biased, because for 3 nights before that, i stayed at the Ramayana Resort in Kuta, and stayed in Vilarisi alone for the following 2 nights.The room was big for the price I paid, and it had a bath and a clean bathroom. The mattress and pillows couldn't compare to the fluffy ones i had at the other hotel, but it was fine for me to sleep in.Pros:- Friendly and helpful staff- great price- large room- cheap foodCons:- Location - it's located on the smaller streets, and gets a bit creepy if walking alone at night.- Mosquitos in the room, but they have repellents in the rooms.", "Date": "Jan 30, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR845848502", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "3", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "2"}, "Author": "nadio"}, {"Content": "Okay, But Not Great       Bed in Room 405", "Date": "Jun 26, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR606401770", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "2", "Overall": "3", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "Bambi_Boulangerie"}, {"Content": "Not very bad but there are better choices...

The rooms are very clean (every day we entered the floor was still wet from the cleaning) and there is air conditioning and a small pool for very cheap pricing. Breakfast is included - a minimal but adequate buffet with eggs done how you like them upon request. We liked this hotel because the rooms were quite large and it was accessible to the beach but away from the noise of cars going up and down the strip. It was also right beside the big shopping street that stretches all the way through Kuta. The only problem was that they're repairing the elevator, so that there is hammering all day right now for some reason. If you're in the room here during the day, though, there's a problem! The rooms facing the pool are a little quieter, but this is still not an issue. Support Bali if you're able through their political problems - it's a very worthwhile destination!", "Date": "Oct 4, 2005", "ReviewID": "UR917065961", "Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "3", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member"}, {"Content": "\u93c3\u30e6\u6e70\u747e\u70aa\u4f04\u95ab\u6c25\u4ed2\u9288\u5b28\u5127\u9289\u55d0\u5137   showReview(21745145, 'full');", "Date": "Oct 19, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR384408010", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "-1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "4", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "lass="}, {"Content": "\u9288\u70bd\u5063\u9289\u581b\u511c\u9289\u66d8\u5050\u9289\u7b3a\u512a\u9289\u70bd\u5063\u9479?#x201d;   showReview(20753577, 'full');", "Date": "Sep 27, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR695260044", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "-1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "4", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "lass="}, {"Content": "\u7039\u5908\u4e9c\u9287\u6219\u4efc\u5a67\u20ac\u74d2\u51b2\u5bb3\u9287\u5c84\u73ee\u9287?#x201d;   showReview(19169031, 'full');", "Date": "Feb 26, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR768274505", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "-1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "4", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "lass="}, {"Content": "\u9289\u52e9\u5044\u9289\u7b3a\u4ef9\u9288\u581b\u4eb8\u6d63\u88e4\u4e9e\u9289\u6d96\u5110\u9289\ue0a0\u4ef9\u9287?#x201d;   showReview(19166859, 'full');", "Date": "Dec 7, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR202369702", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "-1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "4", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "lass="}, {"Content": "\u9288\u70bd\u5063\u9289\u581b\u511c\u9289\u66d8\u5050\u9289\u7b3a\u512a\u9289\u70bd\u5063\u934e\ue044\u539b\u9287\ue1ba\u504d\u9288\u70bd\u5119\u9289\u71b4\u5157\u9289\u6d96\u5110\u9289?#x201d;   showReview(19165902, 'full');", "Date": "Oct 29, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR757113813", "Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "-1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "3", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "lass="}, {"Content": "\u6e1a\u57ae\u57c4   showReview(19160027, 'full');", "Date": "Jan 18, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR764839733", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "-1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "4", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "lass="}, {"Content": "\u9357\u4f78\u578e\u5a67\u20ac\u74d2\u7b79\u7d12\u951b\u64c4\u7d23\u951b\u6136\u7d23\u9350\u55d0\u4f04\u7039?#x201d;   showReview(19154898, 'full');", "Date": "Aug 18, 2005", "ReviewID": "UR240209551", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "-1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "4", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "lass="}], "HotelInfo": {"HotelURL": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g294226-d530672-r13111168-Vilarisi_Hotel-Bali.html", "HotelID": "530672", "Price": "$37"}}
