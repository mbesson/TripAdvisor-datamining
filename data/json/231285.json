For the price that they charge, it was definitely not worth it. 1. BROKEN ELEVATOR. Our room was on the 4th floor, which is really 5 flights of stairs up. Usually, we wouldn't mind the exercise but after walking around Rome the whole day, the last thing we wanted to do was climb 5 flights of stairs to our room. 2. NO PHONE DIRECTORY IN ROOM. We couldn't even call the front desk from our room. 3. NO TV REMOTE IN ROOM. We had to walk down 5 flights of stairs and specifically request a remote control. 4. WIRELESS INCONSISTENT. Internet access worked for us only the first night but not the subsequent nights, which was very frustrating. 5. EVER USED A TABLE CLOTH AS A BATH TOWEL? Well, that was the texture of the bath towels that were provided. 6. THIN WALLS. Could hear the neighbors talking on the phone till 1am. Positives: 1. Rooms very clean. 2. Good location. My advice to everyone: If you want to stay close to Roma Termini, you DON'T have to stay HERE.

The lift was something out of the norm for me, but once you accept that old style European accomodations are different than what we are accustomed to in the USA, it is no problem - just part of the adventure! The hotel shares the building with another hotel, so certain floors were theirs and others were not. The room was clean and comfortable with large shuttered windows which could be opened to view the street below. The furnishings were a little worn but everything was spotless. I will never forget our first night, standing in the open window, listening to the sounds of a violin playing Italian love songs for the diners in the sidewalk cafes. Directly across the street was a little mom & pop cafe where we enjoyed dinner with a personal touch. The location worked well for us as we had arrived by train from the airport and were leaving from Termini to take the overnight train to Paris. Additionally, the tour company we used to for our Rome at night tour and our tour to Pompeii was located only 1 block away. We stayed 3 nights for about the same price as it would have cost to spend 1 night in some of the other hotels. The breakfast buffet was good and served in a pleasant environment. I felt safe enough to walk the streets around the hotel unaccompanied, even at night - but as always, use common sense when out alone - Rome, like all big cities, has it's share of pickpockets and street kids. Overall, we enjoyed our stay and I would recommend this hotel. Additionally, it is located on the right side of Termini, was very convenient to public transportation and could even be considered within walking distance to some of the popular sites, such as the Coloseum, Republic Square, Santa Susanna.
