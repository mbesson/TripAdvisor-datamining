The room we were allocated had a broken tv and a wardrobe that was held together with the side of the chest of drawers. The bathroom window was not frosted so everyone from the street could see us on the toilet. The walls and floors were filthy, the lights had no light bulbs, mirrors were broken, place held together with mastik, none of the crockery of cutlery matched and to top it all we found a used hyperdermic needle next to the television. I asked for a different room and that was just as bad. We got no sleep because of the noise of the traffic and there was no hot water for a shower. They said we would be given a full english breakfast between 8 - 10am and we was offered toast and jam or toast, egg and beans. We chose the latter and no word of a lie there was no more than 2 teaspoonsful of beans. The whole place is a joke.

Immediately we saw a shed outside it with a hand written sign saying RECEPTION on the glass window. We walked in greeting the receptionist and were met with a grunt. Handing our booking sheets he stared at them for 2 minutes and I asked if there was a problem. He started shaking his head saying 'no no no'. I asked if we could check into our room. He said no as our name wasnt on the system ! He said there was no evidence of us ever booking a room with them for that night. The man was Pakistani and his English was very broken which was convient. We were late checking in but this astonished us as we rang twice in the week to let them know what time we'd be getting there. Not once, twice! He said there was no evidence of the phone call and I could be making it up. Despite him sounding like the same person I spoke to on the phone. A refund was not forthcoming saying they do not deal with refunds at the reception desk and it is all done via 3rd partys. He said they had no spare rooms and could not help any further. He was unable to comprehend the point that we had actually already paid for our room. After 10 minutes of discussion me and my partner left and we spent the night on the streets of London using our suitcases as matresses and coats as blankets. As well as this experience the hotel looked totally horrible from the outside. The 'reception' had me in disbelief. The only postiive thing I can think of is the name which does sound grand. I got deceived by this when booking. I am pleased for people who had positive experiences here. It sounds like you were in the minority....that is actually getting into the room you have already paid for and booked. Well done, as I said you are in the minority. The best way to get a room here is pay in cash on the day. No cards, cash. I have been informed by a local who used to work there, that they purposely double book third party bookings which have already paid as most people do not go to the effort of following up getting their money back. It is a scam of which the wheels will hopefully fall off. As we walked off we saw his friend/colleague had appeared in the 'reception' with both their feet up on the table laughing at us. Please listen to this review and be very very hesistant about booking a hotel with them unless you have money to burn for nothing.", "Date": "August 3, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "3", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Manchester", "Title": "\u201cDont believe all you hear about this hotel!!\u201d", "Author": "chubby74 Posted by an OctopusTravel traveler", "ReviewID": "UR115308053", "Content": "My girlfriend and I very nearly cancelled this booking, due to the negative feedback that had been written prior to our arrival.

After standing in silence, despite asking questions of the receptionist, and having to search for my own name on the list of guests we were finally given the key to room number 12. The shower had mildew all over walls which were still wet. The shower had to be hand held as the holder on the wall was broken. In addition, I had to turn the shower off during my shower to allow the standing water to drain away. There was a large hole in the ceiling in the bathroom with plaster falling out and a significant draft coming from it. I am unsure what the scratching sounds were above it but I\u2019m sure I can hazard a guess. The sink was dirty and also had standing water. My partner and I were given 3 hand towels for the room. There were two cups complete with tea bags, sugar and milk but the room had no kettle so were rendered useless. The single pane window did not close properly and so it was cold and you could hear everything outside. The TV did not work as the poorly hand modified coax cable did not fit.

I can categorically deny there was any sign of anything that looked refurbished. The set of drawers contained an empty packet of cigarettes and several screws.
