Service at the front desk is slow and inefficient...there seem to be employees everywhere but none helping guests... they are either on the phone, staring at paper, writing in ledgers or having conversations about lord knows what which demands concentration and exuberance - usually while guests are standing in the queue to check out/check in/ask a question/order a taxi...you name it... the rooms are basic. NO wifi, basic towels, fierce lighting, dorm style beds, basic toiletries and tiled floors (so, beware if you are on floor 1 and have someone above you!) if you face the 'park' you will hear traffic from 7 am until midnight.. the breakfast room looks like a wedding hall banquet with a decent breakfast (cold/hot buffet) but all too stiff and formal...this is not a good tourist hotel, it is for businessmen like me on a budget and an overnight stay. It is not very comfortable, nor is it convenient to much apart from EUR location.

The location is also within walking distance of the EUROMA 2 (the largest mall in Lazio). Our room was a typical European room (FIRM mattress, flat pillows, and sparse surroundings). All of this would be fine except that the walls are PAPER THIN. I could actually hear the guy in the next room switching on and off the lights on the bedside table! Apparently, this guy also had malaria or something since he COUGHED all night . . . and we could hear him! So, for that I give this hotel an AVERAGE rating. I would rate it higher than the Sheraton Roma (we have stayed here many times) . . . at least the staff at the Shangri la are capable of checking travelers into their rooms in less than an hour. Finally, our keys kept losing their ability to open the door . . . I did find it funny that the guy at the front desk wanted to see my passport (which was in the room) before resetting my key! The staff in the breakfast room were VERY accommodating! Our room was not ready when we arrived, but the cappuccino and cornetto with a selection of fresh fruit took away some of the aggravation of waiting. By the way, the water pressure at this hotel is AWESOME! Take a nice hot shower with plenty of water pressure was a huge plus!", "Date": "February 21, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "usa", "Title": "\u201cPerfect location and set-up\u201d", "Author": "usintheusa", "ReviewID": "UR122444869", "Content": "We checked in with a pet, this was no problem for them and they did not charge us more for this.

Breakfast is rather modest, thumbs up for a choice of pastry and possibility of getting good coffee from the bar (the one on the buffet table is vile) but apart from that - not much more to eat.

The rooms are exactly what you expect and are good enough to get your head down (as that is what they are for). I asked for a double (king size) bed in my room and upon arrival we found that two single beds had been pushed together instead. The fact that this is advertised as a resort made me want to book it as it sounded fantastic to be able to do everything on site but sadly they closed the restaurant (which then means a very long walk to find somewhere to eat), the shops too were closed and the bar only opened until 1900 hours which is very poor indeed. My tip basically is if you want to go here DO NOT book August as you will be dissapointed. If you do not have a car then hire one as it is a great distance from almost everything, but with a car and sat nav you will easily find places like the Vatican Museum etc and these are well worth the visit. The resort may well live up to it's 4 star standard throughout the year but during my stay here it would have been lucky to have achieved 1 star.

Shower doors, for lack of a better word, did not close - and I suspect never did. You can imagine the result. In a country that boasts of Da Vinci and Michaelangelo this was an engineering nightmare.
