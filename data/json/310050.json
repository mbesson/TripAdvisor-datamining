We went up to our room and found it cold and the heat was off. There was only a sheet and a thin blanket on the bed (no bedspread), so I went downstairs to ask for some more blankets. After much discussion with the others behind the counter, the woman emphasized I could only have ONE blanket because they would not have enough blankets for everyone if all the rooms asked for more. We had a queen size bed and the extra blanket they gave us was for a twin bed. We turned on the heater and went out for a few hours, when we returned, the room was still freezing cold! After fiddling with the thermostat some more and then talking to the front desk, we found out that it was wired backwards and you had to set it to \"cooling\" to get the heat to come on. Really? It took until morning to get the room up to a comfortable temperature. Hoping for a shower to warm up in was another big disappointment. The water pressure was okay, but the temperature was barely warm enough to be comfortable. I'm not looking for a scalding hot shower, but the mirror didn't even steam up in the bathroom if that tells you anything. The towels were skimpy and somewhat resembled table linens (maybe they were). The bathroom could use a good scrub and the shower tiles were black with mildew. The ceiling in the bedroom had black mildew as well. The toilet didn't always flush. The shower door fell off when I opened it. The in-room fridge and safe did not work, and the chair, while pretty, was about to fall apart and unsafe to sit in. At a quick glance, the place looked very elegant, but it really was very tired and not well maintained. The people running it don't really seem to care.

In late October we did not notice any unpleasant smells from the nearby canal as other reviews stated but the rooms on the ground floor clearly have a mould problem and I preferred to have the window wide open in spite of chilly night temperatures. Other than that many of the rooms are nicely decorated and sufficiently spacious- however not as nicely as shown on the Internet. The public transport to Venice is by no means as good as described on the Internet and their shuttle bus requires 24 hours notice if you want to be sure to get on. The breakfast for 6 Euros offered a variety of choices although some seemed a bit strange for breakfast, which however is down to personal taste. There was sufficient of everything at 8 am when we had our breakfast.

This hotel came as a recommendation from a co-worker so, I gave it a shot. first off, this hotel is approx. 20 mins. from the City center via a shuttle that is by appointment only. The van can only fit so many people. The last van shuttle from Venice is at 10 pm. Secondly, the staff was not helpful at all. In fact, when I called to reschedule the van pick up at the airport due to a flight delay. The woman who answered the phone at the front desk explained to me that she was way too busy with other things to help me out. There was no other accommodation had so, I was forced to take the public bus to the train station of Mestre (which is the actual village location of the hotel), then to take a cab to the hotel which was roughly 25 euros. Finally, after having to reconfigure my ride to the hotel I arrived at the hotel to a very cold greeting by the staff. I was tired at this point and just wanted to get to my room. Before I was handed the 5 pound key that looks like it belonged to the Bates motel I was informed that there is \"tourist tax\" that is accrued by the hotel because of the \"high season\" . That was roughly 15 euros. Off to the room I go, the room was not bad but, there was a connected long patio with which to share with your neighbors and I quickly learned how thin the walls were. Fast forward to the next morning. I awake to eat breakfast which is 6 euros (not a bad spread, either). I asked to find an ATM and the woman, who I believed was the same voice who answered the night before she informed me that it was a 10 min walk away from the hotel. It was in fact 20 mins. With directions from the locals. There is no ATM in the hotel. There was also a man at the front dest who basically grunted at me when I asked him questions about the shuttle. He was the van driver. Btw, the van costs 3 euros to and fro to Venice. While waiting for the van to drop me off at the airport it was 15 mins. Late with no explanation and it was an appointed time. Also, keep in mind that if you're trying to get to the airport give yourself enough time to get there because the people to be dropped off in Venice have priority over your getting to the airport. Without saying, there were many van shuttle issues. This hotel was a great disappointment.

But if you want a hotel that is pretty, friendly, accommodating, quiet, pleasant, spotlessly clean, and inexpensive, the Villa Dori fills the bill. Two morning shuttles--at 9:30 and 10:30 a.m.--get you into Venice in about 20 minutes. You have the option of purchasing an ample breakfast at the hotel for 5 euros before you leave for Venice. The evening shuttles--at 9:00 and 11:00 p.m.--give most people plenty of time to do everything that is possible to do in one day in Venice before turning in for a restful night. Additionally, the shuttle willl take you to and from the airport and elsewhere for the cost of a modestly-priced taxi. You can also take two public buses (use your \"Hello Venizia\" card), which runs every half hour. We did that twice. If the buses don't connect exactly, you may have to wait up to a half hour for the connection, so plan on that eventuality. Both of the rooms we had were sunny and bright, recently painted and spotless. Some of the earlier reviews are possibly out of date, as the entire hotel seems to be newly renovated. The housekeeping staff is impeccable. The downstairs reception area is pleasand and inviting. The internet, which you can get very well in the open areas and less well in your room, costs 7 euros--which is about half the price of internet service in hotels in Venice. There is a vending machine full of snacks, hot and cold. The restaurant attached to the hotel, open only in the evening, adds to the desirability of taking the 9:00 shuttle \"home\" to a decently-priced supper. If you want to enjoy a leisurely meal in Venice, though, you might want to plan on the 11:00 shuttle. The best reason for staying on the mainland, other than price, is that you can explore the nearby estates and wine region and other places such as Padua (where St. Anthony is buried) and Ravenna (home of 5th century artifacts) and still be within reach of Venice.

We had to take a coach bus to this town that begins with an \"M.\" Then we had to take local transportation to the hotel. Except, we only speak English, couldn't read road signs and bus stops weren't really marked on the streets. You're on this bus for awhile, and you're kind of driving through boondocks/manufacturing-looking areas. So we hopped off when we saw the street, but it was premature. We had to walk some to finally get to the hotel. And then, to go to Venice, we had to walk back that same distance to catch this other public bus. That bus took about 25minutes to get into Venice. And we were only in Venice for 1 day, so we booked the hotel transfer service to pick us up from Venice that evening. We went back to Venice the next morning using that same public bus. Once you know what to do, it's not that much of a pain. So other than that confusing bout, Villa Dori was a good stay. Nothing really around the hotel that I could see.

We had a car so the trip from the hotel to Venice, went like this. We drove about 10 minutes from the hotel to just before the bridge that takes you to Venice. Before the bridge, there's guarded secure parking lots that run 24 hours a day and charge only 4 Euros per day to park there. Unbelievably good deal since the parking garages on Venice Island were around 20 Euros a day. There's a bus stop in front of the parking lot and you can take any bus into Venice which is about a 5 to 10 minute ride. Get a 24 hour bus and boat pass which you can buy at the hotel for the same price you'd pay in Venice. It provides unlimited travel on buses and boats for 24 hours when you first get your ticket stamped which is either on your first ride on the bus or boat. Great deal and saves you a ton of money if you plan to use the boat to get around in Venice more than a couple of times. Breakfast could be had at a restaurant next door to the hotel for 5 Euros but after taking a peak at what was offered, I opted to wait and eat in Venice on the island. The hotel rooms were amazing!
