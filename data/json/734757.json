The location is fantastic and every where a tourist would need to go is easily accessible on foot or using the metro, of which there are many stations nearby. Bit of advice, simply avoid eating on las ramblas. On the first night we arrived quite late and not having our bearings picked the nicest looking tapas bar.

Breakfast was basic self-serve continental however there were several pastry shops close by so we chose to go to one for coffee and fresh pastry. The staff were friendly and helpful and there was a fridge with free water in the lobby; a very nice touch. They provided small as well as large bottles.
