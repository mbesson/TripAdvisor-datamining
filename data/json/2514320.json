It's not great but not terrible like the review says it probably falls into the category of poor unless your a bit pretentious and expect the best wherever you go.

The room given to my partner and I was Room 34, which can only be described as smaller than a rabbit hutch. The room was dirty, small, badly designed and equipped. 1, Toe nail found on desk next to phone!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! 2, Fully equipped kitchenette = Small cupboard with tiny fridge, sink and a microwave. unfortunately the position of television on wall rendered the \"kitchenette\" almost unusable. 3. Room was so small, if you have 1 suitcase you have to climb over the bed to access the other side of the room. Thus enabling you to peer through the filthy window to the street below. 4, Bathroom = Shower unable to keep constant temperature, lighting inadequate and worked randomly when tapped repeatedly. Dirty. 5, Internet = Free if you can access it. However not being able to see or connect to the network does not in my eyes constitute free internet. Pathetic! 6, Reception on television very poor. 7, Continental breakfast = Joke! Toast, cornflakes, and offee. Where was the fresh fruit, maybe a croissant or pastry? Pathetic. That also extends to the Breakfast room, which was also small dirty and cramped. I could not get my legs under the table to sit straight!

Everywhere we stayed was booked ahead and pre-paid. This was our only bad experience. First off, we were told breakfast was 7:30 to 10:30 in the morning. I will return to this point. Upon registering, we only received the magnetic key entry--nothing else. We deposited our luggage in our room. To say we were disappointed would be an understatement. We returned to the front desk to ask where we could find a pub for supper. \"Up past the turnabout\" was the response. We set out walking--we ended up picking up snacks from a corner store, never did find a pub... We were afraid to walk on the carpet in bare feet--dirty, and covered with burn marks from an iron. Who knows what was lurking in amongst those fibres. One of the beds was jammed up against the window which looked out onto a dirty yard full of garbage. The window was open, and there were several flies buzzing around the room which we were unable to send to a better place. Although the sheets were clean, there was no mattress pad between me and the mattress, and I still have a bite that hasn't healed now 5 days later. We went for breakfast just before 9:25 am. We were abruptly told that breakfast was over. I asked for a bun or croissant, nope, nothing, breakfast is over. Upon attending to the front desk, I was told to consult the card that I had NOT been given the night before. It was shoved into my face, and emphasized that the card distinctly said that breakfast was over at 9:30. It didn't seem to matter a whit that I didn't get that card, or that I was told 10:30. When I asked for a refund of the breakfast, all that the manager would say is \"Not my problem\". So we were out the cost of our breakfast in addition to a lousy night's sleep. I wouldn't recommend this to my worst enemy!! This place has no customer service, and no respect.

The funny thing was, when I told the man at Kensington's front desk about this, he looked at me pointedly, and asked, \"York House Hotel? 27-28 Philbeach Gardens?\" It turns out that he and his partners had previously owned York House Hotel before selling it, to the God-awful people that now ru(i)n it. And then he was kind of sad. We both were.) The room I had was a nonsmoking double used as a single, and it was completely, spotlessly clean, which for there being a kitchenette in the room and for my standards, takes some responsible human beings to do. It was indeed small, and kind of hard to move around in, but all you needed was there. The kitchenette included a microwave , a mini fridge (Godsend when you are trying to save money when traveling!), sink, dishes and utensils, detergent, and teabags and coffee and kettle. The owner even had the thoughtfulness to put up a plank of wood on top of the bed so you can put your books, eyeglasses, cups, and whatnots there. There were overhead reading lights, too. The bathroom was fine. Everything looked pretty new, and was clean. The bed was comfortable, the sheets and cover new and clean. Something else worth mentioning--I stayed in a nonsmoking room cluster, and during my first night my neighbor (also nonsmoking room) started smoking, which was beginning to make me sick. I went down to the receptionist to gripe, and the nice, and somewhat boisterous Indian man made the smoking neighbor come out to apologize to me. :) I loved this place, and thought I might have found my own little spot, when I go to London; it's kind of heartbreaking for me to see all these bad reviews now, becuase it held a darling little place in my heart.

The room had everything as stated on the website: microwave, fridge, sink, private bathroom (although the shower had no curtain!), a tv (with about 40 channels!), air con, a cupboard, chair, mirrors, soap and shampoo, kettle with tea and coffee, cups and plates, hairdryer, an iron on request and best of all, free wifi! The service was also very good, with my bed being made everyday, room tidied and vaccumed and clean towels everyday. However the inside of the toilet bowl could have done with some cleaning....The man on reception was very helpful, he even let me print from the printer free of charge. Breakfast was nothing special, but sufficient! Eggs, toast, cereal, milk, orange juice, jam, tea and coffee. The location of the hotel was excellent, very close to shops, pubs and the underground. Although they told me Kensington Olympia was the closest train, it is an Overground train, and doesn't come as often. Shepherds Bush Underground is almost as close, and much more convenient as it is on the Central line with trains coming and going every few minutes, and will connect you to anywhere! The hotel is about 5-10 mins walk to Westfield London in one direction, and High Street Kensington in the other direction! In saying all of this, there were a few negative things, such as the annoying card to get into the room (instead of a key) that decided to stop working sometimes. It was annoying staying in the room with reception right above me as I heard everyone as they came in and out. Also the tv came on by itself every morning. Kind of a good wake up call, but some days I wanted to sleep a little past 7.30am.... Overall, the Kensington Suite Hotel was great value for money (I booked it on Rates to Go for 45 pounds per night). I had no major complaints, the free wifi was a definite bonus, and the location was excellent. If you are staying by yourself in London, it is a good little place to spend a few nights!

Some of the faults I list below. 1. Our bedroom, located , we were to find, in the basement, had an unlockable window which gave a view of a messy yard. 2 Three beds were squeezed into a very small room 3.There was nowhere to put our luggage.or hang anything (although there was a microwave). 4 .The shower had a broken towel rack, with parts on the floor. 5. There was no bath mat, no toilet roll holder. 6. The bathroom sink had a wine bottle lid stuck inside its plug hole. . This could have been easily removed with long pointed pliers (which we were not, of course, carrying with us). As a result of the lid being there, the plug could not be used to fill the basin. 7. The heating was piped in ...and very hot. One heater was up against one of the beds. 8. The window, with a broken cord, had to be propped open. It also needed cleaning. We listed all these faults, some of which could have been easily fixed, and gave the list to reception when we left for the day after our first night there. When we came back that evening, nothing had been attended to, nor was anything done before we checked out. The breakfasts at the Kensington Suite were poor by comparison with Continental and Irish breakfasts. Only one cereal was offered. The milk to go with it was unrefrigerated. The only hot item available was a boiled egg . There was not enough seating in the dining area, for the number of peoply wanting to eat. Kensington Suite was , I repeat, a major disappointment", "Date": "July 26, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "1.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "West Yorkshire", "Title": "\u201cThe worst hotel experience I've ever encountered!\u201d", "Author": "blackhalo", "ReviewID": "UR18030894", "Content": "I really feel that I must warn other potential visitors about the appalling way I was treated by this establishment. I had a room booked at the Kensington Suite Hotel (Formerly the Westfield Suite Hotel) for 3 nights, which I had chosen based on the fact that it had 3* facilities and what appeared to be cosy rooms that looked rather lovely for the price, and that it was in an ideal location which was quiet and fairly close to where I was working. Upon arrival at the hotel, I was greeted by a receptionist who took down my name and bank details, before informing me that I would not in fact be spending my first night at this hotel because there was a problem with my room. I asked reasonable questions such as where I would be sleeping, I was ignored and simply told \"another hotel. I call a cab now\"; was then sent across to Ascot Hotel in Paddington, where the cab driver had been instructed to hand an envelope to reception. I was left standing and waiting in reception for 20 minutes while the receptionist took a cig break and slowly dealt with a couple of people in front of me, and I was finally dealt with only to be informed that I'd been sent to the wrong hotel (before he resorted to having a good laugh about it with his colleague as if some sort of inside joke! Incredibly rude!) By now I was starting to feel rather wound up, as it was actually beginning to seem as though this was no more than an elaborate scam to take my money with no intention of providing a place to stay. So I was handed the envelope back and told I had to walk a few hundred yards down the road to another hotel, which was far from the 3* quality I was expecting during my stay, but perhaps a 1* - a cold family room that reminded me more of a bed-sit than any hotel I\u2019ve ever stayed in! I called up the hotel to complain, and felt as though I was being spoken down to; basically the receptionist made this out to be no big deal, informing me that \u201cIt\u2019s only for one night\u201d. In the end I decided that this was too much of an inconvenience for me, as this also meant that I would have to cart my luggage across London during rush hour trying to switch locations in time to get over to work for 9AM, and I managed to make alternative arrangements. I was promised a refund that night, which three days later I am still waiting on. I have no clue what the rooms in the hotel were like, but the level of customer service I received was shocking and I can only imagine how bad they treat guests when they actually stay at the hotel!", "Date": "July 19, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "2", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "2", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Telford", "Title": "\u201cTiny!\u201d", "Author": "Tooley1988", "ReviewID": "UR13059851", "Content": "THE ROOM- was really tiny they put 3 beds in our room & if three people did sleep in the room it would of been very wrong because all the beds where next to each other. bathroom was really small you couldnt move around it at all & the shower was just about big enough to do a 360 in it. the whole time i was there they did not change my bed & did not take the rubbish out the room when i left in by the window. BREAKFAST- The breakfast was rubbish we asked for a full english the first day we was there & full english is defo not what you would call it. they gave us one sasuage & 1 bacon & the bacon was cold & sasuage was cheap. they gave us a handful of beans & a egg and all that took 25mins to come to us. the tables where rubbish because the chairs would not go under the table so you would have to have your legs to the side to sit down. THE HOTEL- the hotel if you could call it that, its just two old victorian house knocked into two & put as many rooms in as possible. It looked really nice when you walked in but if it was raining at any point then you would slip on the stairs going into the place as they were mable steps.
