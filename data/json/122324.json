We arrive and the clerk barely speaks English, which we didn't really mind at first. We got our room key and headed upstairs. First off, the bed had NO fitted sheet on the mattress, only a flat sheet with a comforter and pillows. Therefore, every time we would move on the bed, the sheets would move as well. As I got up to use the bathroom, the sheets had moved along with the pillows, and I looked down and I saw a huge blood stain on the mattress. I was speechless. I made my boyfriend look at it to make sure it really was blood, instead maybe wine or some sort of liquid. It definitely appeared to be blood. At this point, I was freaking out. I was up the whole night, trying to pick up other things that are wrong with the room. The curtains in the room were torn and ripped in various spots, and the carpet beneath the curtain had ANOTHER blood stain (near the window.) . Disgusting. We happened to leave the next morning before the check out time. Later that day, my boyfriend called the police and reported what we have encountered at the Hub motel. Police said they were going to send 2 cars to check it out. And that was the last that I heard. So, please don't EVER stay here. I honestly will never forget that night.", "Date": "March 18, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "2", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "1", "Check in / front desk": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "Philadelphia, PA", "Title": "\u201cIf you like tha projects... you've come home !!!!\u201d", "Author": "Datachick1213", "ReviewID": "UR21221310", "Content": "This place smelled bad. I was so sorry I didn't pay the extra $10 and stay across the street; It's pretty bad when the counter help dosen't speak english.

Although they have the best rates I have ever seen, it is not worth it, pay the extra $10.00 to stay at a more reputable and also cleaner place. I was forced to spend the evening with my daughter and good thing that I carry a blanket in the car. We used that blanket and our coats to lie on and cover up. There were various stains on the walls, including something that looked like slime (it was probably [--]). The floor had not been vacuumed, and the bathroom floor has nor been swept or mopped.
