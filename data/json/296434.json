Good sides are: close tram and not too big but not too small. They have minimum amenities. Down sides are: walls are so thin and sometimes noice was disturbing. Breakfast could be improved.

Bologna but little cheese, etc. Some things (such as orange juice!) even cost extra. 3.

Fruit basket was waiting on a corner table, \"with the compliments from the manager\" in a note. The toilet is big and had enough light (this is one of the things I always lack of on trips - enough light to actually see the make-up I put on). Big closet, extra blankets, huge mirror, welcome note on the tv, these were all important touches that added to the impression. The only thing I could complain about is TV, which is too loud when turned on (this can be a very bad waking up experience if you're sleeping while your partner turns it on). Breakfast was a treat as well. Combination of Turkish and international things included: various Turkish pastry, cornflakes, salads, eggs, salami, borek, cakes, plain and fruit joghurt, cheese, chocolate, jams, olives and more things that I can't even remember. The restaurant where it's served, called Venezia, has some inconsistencies in decorations, but my compliments go to the designer who made a project for it. The hotel also has a cafe-bar in the lobby and I think a pool at the roof, which we didn't go to at all. If (or should I say when) I go back to Istanbul, I would probably choose this hotel again.
