Taxi driver has no difficulty finding the hotel. Near convenience stores, mall center and other restaurants. Exterior: Beautiful designs and the hotel is new. Interior: high ceiling, artsy lounge area, there are wooden arts install at the lobby. Frontdesk: Very accommodating and speak English very well. We have no problem checking in and out. Room: The room was amazing, as what you see in the pictures, all glass! You can have full view of the cityscape or sea (depending where your room is facing at) so make sure to have the highest floor. When we stayed there, we even saw some large birds! The bed is huge and change the beddings everyday, it has huge flatscreen behind a wall-art-painting-two door sliding cabinet, and at the head board a mural painting, really cool, esp for honeymooners. If you change clothes or do some \u201cprivate\u201d thingy, make sure to pull down the blinds if you don\u2019t want to be photographed, watched, recorded by people staying at nearby hotel. Thumbs-down-note: over all it\u2019s cool but the bathroom is made of all glass as well so when taking a bath if the lights are not switched off or the blinds are up, you will give some \u201clive and free\u201d showdown for all the eyes there and for your room mate. The bathroom also do not have doors, so the cool breeze from the air condition unit will freeze you while showering hehehe, good thing the toilet has door though it\u2019s still all glass, no smell will come out lols!

The work comform has no match for this property. Its rooms are very welll designed, so the lack of space is compensated by a smart, chic, and very well achieved distribution and feel. The beds were very comfortable, and so was the ambiences that you could create with the well designed lighting system around the room. I found the conrollers near the bed very easy to understand, convenient to use and very practical. As soon as you enter the room (I was in one of the standard, harbour view bedrooms) you see a large closet that serves a double purpose of storing clothes, and also a hidden mini-bar. Then you see immediatly to your side a hall with your \"integrated\" bathroom, with the sink and vanity quite exposed, and then in two separate rooms, the toilet and the most amazing shower I have used in a while. Going straight, to the right, there was a long bench with 3 very convenient drawers for storing clothes and 1 containing a horizontal safe. then you see the office space, very conveniently setup, and above that, a frame that when you slide it, unveils a Panasonic HD television. Opposite to all that, was the King-size bed, with two convenient floodlights on top and two reading lamps on the side to set the right mood. To the side of the beds, are individual light controllers for the entire room, having a great \"night\" mode that turns on dicrete accent lights around the bed, the bed frame, the bathroom area and others. You can also turn all of the lights on creating a more bright environment. The room's front facing wall to the street are all HUGE windows, and you have a wonderful setting next to the bed that closes or open automatically shades that make the windows completely opaque for a good night sleep (perfect to adjust yourself to the time change). The restaurant was really good, the Sugar bar was chic, well priced and had a wonderful atmosphere and its Gym and pool were top nothc (although the equipment is not abundant, so expect delays specially in the mornings). For those of you business folks, the Internet connections and services on the hotel were great, fast and reliable. So all and all, this hotel surpassed my expectations, and I would totally recommend it. Some of the things I think are not so great about this property, is that it is far from where all happens, the good news is that the hotel sits on top of the Tai Koo station, so gtting in and out is not so hard. but the ride to Caseway Bay is like 10 minutes and to the rest of the main attractions in HKG Island, around 20 - 25 minutes commute. I have to say though that I liked this isolation for my time of retreat as it disconnected me from the business of the other areas of Hong Kong.

Rooms - Beds are very comfortable and I found the room to be very quiet. I was never disturbed by noise. The bathroom however, was bad. It's an open plan so there is no door and clear glass; so no privacy, unless you are in the toilet. (But ok if you are alone, I suppose) Wifi - good; strong signal and no connection problems Restaurant - food was average to good; service was consistently BAD. Nearly every time I ate there I had to ask the waitstaff 2-3 times for something, whether it was water, or my drink, or asking where my meal was. And that is if you could flag them down. Oftentimes, they barely understood English, which meant my order got messed up a few times. However they were very quick to make sure you signed your bill. Not acceptable for a business hotel.

The location is absolutely perfect for those who like shopping since the hotel is connected to Cityplaza - the biggest mall on Hongkong Island. There are plenty of shops and restaurants for western and eastern taste and also a large foodcourt. East may is a bit far from Central, but the metro is literally right beneath the hotel. Bad weather is not an issue since you can travel anywhere from Taikoo station without having to step outdoors. Had a room with cityview and that is looking straight into local residents livingrooms.

While nothing spectacularly mind-blowing, the East does give very good vibes and many things were in order, except for some small matters. I do have meetings at Quarry Bay (one station away) and I met an old client for a very good dinner at nearby Soho East, and employees of one of my most important Hong Kong clients have rented apartments within walking distance from the East. So in more ways than one, the location of this hotel can't be beat. Yes, I also had meetings at Wan Chai, Central and Kowloon and the distance from the East is significant, but the MTR station right at the door step of the hotel mitigates this aspect. Within 20 minutes, you're zipped to Central or Admiralty, and slightly more with a change of MTR line, you're in downtown Tsimshatsui or even further up north at Mongkok or Yau Ma Tei. What's weird about this hotel's location is that it's actually amidst a residential area. Unless you're out by the early hours of the day and back only late in the night, you cannot help but see the \"family-ness\" of this area. Around 10 am, there are many mothers and maids bringing kids to school, and by the early afternoon, many old folks congregate at the nearby shopping mall for lunch or simply watch their grandchildren gobble down the burgers from McDonald's. By the early evening, you see many teenagers in school uniform gallivanting with friends or enjoying a popsicle in the hot summer weather. So the East, being avant garde in design and trendy in attracting the hip and fashionable, especially to its Sugar bar at the roof-top, is very much sticking out like a sore thumb in this Tai Koo Shing location. Not that I was doing anything un-family, but the feel within and just outside the hotel is just so different I sometimes forget I am on a business trip; the Sunday afternoon I arrived, I thought of my mother asking me for lunch at her flat which could be just like any one of those nearby! As mentioned earlier, this hotel is some distance from the main business centre of Hong Kong, about 6 MTR stations away to be exact, if you consider Causeway Bay as part of the commercial centre of Hong Kong. The morning crowd on the MTR can be maddening, but somewhat mitigated by the politeness and graciousness of most Hong Kongers commuting on this mode of public transport. Shopping at next-door City Plaza is very much geared towards the family, and for that matter the upper-class families of Hong Kong. Things aren't cheap in this Asian city and it shows here at City Plaza, or the nearby Jusco hypermart on the other end of the MTR station's exit. Unlike Wan Chai, Causeway Bay or TST, you also do not have too many food choices if you want a late-night snack and there's no nightlife to talk about. If that bothers you, you need to know all this family-ness of this part of Hong Kong. The hotel itself is well designed in a minimalistic way. Hues of orange and grey punctuate the lobby, which gives a clean and slick look, without much of a clutter. I do not like the metallic-looking stairs leading up to the mezzanine floor which is the (only) restaurant of the hotel, reminds me of the Terminator look which is too industrial to me. The rooms are perhaps the best part of this outfit. It's compact but does not give the claustrophic feeling, something many hotel rooms in land-scarce Hong Kong do. The design and use of space is very intelligent, and I was told that it's by one of the top designers in this part of the world, Andre Fu. Not that I am au fait with this designer, but I do think the design of the East's room shows how talented he is and how much he understands the pecularity of the locality he's handling. I had the honour of staying in a harbour-view room, and although nothing like the views of tall office buildings in Kowloon or Central I had in earlier stays in more central locations of this city, they were welcoming and nice nonethless. The proximity to the many residential buildings at Tai Koo Shing means that some of the lower-floor rooms will definitely get to see the going-ons in some of Hong Kong's families and no real view to talk about. Amenities-wise, the East's rooms are adequate, except for the strange fact that there is no shoe horn in the room, even on request. This hotel is no budget option and although I do not think they profess to be 5-star, they do have many 5-star facilities such as a highly-comfortable rain shower, well-stocked mini-bar, high-end toiletries and most of the vanities you can imagine for use. Without a shoe horn does not seem right here, especially since I insist on wearing my boots using one. This hotel does however profess to be green and no printed bill is given when you check out. It's presented to you on an iPad-like screen before you at reception and then you check and sign on the screen. Of course, if you like it to be printed, you can still choose to kill some trees. Otherwise, you can ask them to email you (they were supposed to have done so instantaneously but did so only after I emailed back 1 day to remind) a copy. Service-wise, there were some misses like what I mentioned about the shoe horn and the emailing of the bill. The concierge was also not fast enough in responding to your needs (I needed to wait more than 20 minutes for luggage help when I checked out) and the smiles and willingness to please are very much absent from the East, unlike those big-name 5-star hotels which I'd stayed in, such as the Shangri-La, the Ritz Carlton and the Peninsula. Granted the East should and cannot be compared with these hotels, so let's not split hairs here. Still, perhaps due to the dull uniform and staid design of this hotel, the East's staff gives a certain clinical coldness, nothing warm at all. They may wish to rectify this by being more enthusiastic in pleasing customers and also smiling broadly more and greeting guests more warmly. All in all, the East is an impressive hotel which delivers well, especially for the price I was paying. Some points were missed understandably but by and large, I think the East will be a good choice to stay, perhaps more for a family holiday rather than a business trip.", "Date": "June 30, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Singapore", "Title": "\u201cPerfect Business Hotel\u201d", "Author": "holiday_phreak", "ReviewID": "UR132193992", "Content": "The room was clean, comfortable, and most importantly perfect for a business trip.

Here are some of my opinions that I would like to share in related to the hotel room. It did not impress me at all when I first stepped into my room which was located on the lower 8th floor with urban view. It means that not only there is no view but also no privacy if you do not have the electronic window blinds closed completely. The reason is that those people living so close by across the street can clearly spot you from outside their homes. I felt very uncomfortable during my entire trip and had to have it closed it immediately when getting into my room. No traditional \"DO NOT DISTURB\" door knob sign can be located. Instead, by pressing a button on the bed-side-table and as soon as a tiny red light comes on, no one will bother you from the outside of the room. Door bell is not reasonably loud enough to be alert of. In addition, the only sink that I used during my stay got stuck twice in a row without a clue. (I got someone have it fixed the first time but did not bother it the last day when I checked out the hotel) Plus the water from the sink can splash everywhere. Besides, if you do need to use the toilet, once the door stays open widely (it has to be pulled out), no one can make his way across from either side. I found out it is very weird that there are only 2 pieces of wall glasses being used (one is facing you directly inside the bathroom while the other one is standing side way in the toilet) for the entire room are in deep brown or burgundy. (still got question marks everywhere in my mind and been trying to figure it out.) The setting of the clock is not very practical - you have to get up in your bed and turn back in order to read the time with your lazy eyes. It is always a hassle to set the alarm clock unless you have the patience to go through those tons of steps or instructions. I-pod can never stand on its dock station securely unless you find something else to support it. Over all, I can only give my thumbs up to those friendly-used 37\" LCD TV as well as those complimentary tea bags along with the espresso machine that can suit my needs. Services provided is just average. Since \"MTR\" is just right across the hotel's main entrance plus both shopping mall as well as a huge variety of foods are very easily available at \"Cityplaza\" and which is just a block away. If you are purely looking for convenience, it is highly recommended for you to stay at the \"East\"", "Date": "June 11, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "5.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Auckland", "Title": "\u201cBest Hotel, Highly Recommended\u201d", "Author": "eddy238", "ReviewID": "UR131446655", "Content": "We did an Asia tour (Malaysia, Brunei, Singapore, Thailand, Macau, and Hong Kong) and the East Hotel in Hong Kong was definitely our favourite.

I loved the shower which had a glass window allowing you to look at Kowloon whilst being drenched by a rain water shower head. Little touches like iPod with music on it, laptop available on request if you need to book DHL for some reason, a lolly jar, in room travel adaptor, cords etc. I would recommend a harbour view room for sure. There was also a notepad next to the bed with puzzles to play if you're travelling alone or want to tune out for a while. Loved this.

The courteous staffs always gave me very good impression, until I have the following incident, I have to say they have excellent customer services! The Hotel locates in a somewhat residential area from what I can see. Like many other HK attractions, it is very convenient as it has many different choices of public transportation. Even late at night, you can take the MTR which is only an escalator away, or the taxi stand always line up with taxis. The roof top lounge - Sugar, has an amazing view, particularly if you choose the outside seating. If you will go at night like I did, I highly recommend to bring an outerwear or a scarf with you. On the night before I return to the States, I spent an enjoyable night with my friends at Sugar again. While on the way back to the hotel that we stayed, my boyfriend realized he lost his iPhone. We immediately went back to East HK and planned to search for it. Unfortunately the lounge was already closed at this point. We then talked to the front desk hostess and explained the situation. She immediately escalated up to her manager, and he offered to bring us up to the lounge without hesitation. It was already 3 a.m. The manager also asked couple of other staffs to help searching but with no luck. They searched every possible places including the bathroom stalls, planters behind the seats, spaces underneath the sofas, flipped thru all the seat cushions etc. Sadly we left with empty hands at around 4:30 a.m. The manager asked for our contact info and promised if he would find it, he would call us. We then gave my HK friend's contact info to the manager. Coming back to the States with disappointment and ready to buy another phone, then my friend told me that she received a call from the East HK few days later and said the iPhone was found.

As a point of reference I travel to HK and throughout the US regularly. My last stay in HK was at the Conrad. The East is very close to my company\u2019s main processing office in CityPlaza 4, hence the stay there as opposed to Pacific Place. In summary \u2013 the East is a good business hotel. The rooms are somewhat small, but serviceable. The storage space is limited \u2013 especially for a 12 day stay, but for 1 \u2013 5 night it\u2019s no problem. The bath area takes some getting used to \u2013 it is an open concept, but the shower area is nice with very good water pressure and all the necessary amenities provided. The bed was very comfortable and even on the 14th floor, I was not bothered by street noise. The rolling window shades provided plenty of light blocking. The room is modern in its decorations \u2013 not over the top but the hardwood floors with carpeting around the bed with some modern art on the walls worked for me. The room was bright enough and I never had an issue working there. I found the staff to be very friendly and always willing to be of service, from the front-desk to the restaurant staff to the attendants in the gym / pool area. Sugar on the top floor is the lounge and it is very nice if the weather cooperates for a late night drink with a view of the harbor. The snack menu there is limited but tasty. Feast is the only hotel restaurant on the 1/F \u2013 the breakfast buffet is reasonable with a selection of fruit, pastries / breads, juices, yogurts and muesli / cereals. Hot entries can be ordered for breakfast. The coffee service seemed a bit slow and I changed to tea after 2 days as it usually took 5 minutes to individually brew another cup of coffee when mine ran out. I only had lunch there once and it was crowded, so I assume the selection was good. Due to late night business, calls I did order room service 3 times \u2013 the food was delivered on time and correctly. The gym area is reasonably small, but they seem to have enough equipment. The pool deck is quite large with nice loungers to relax in. Overall I had a good experience there - the hotel is clean, nicely decorated, basically comfortable if not utilitarian, and the staff very friendly and helpful. The location is a bit inconvenient if you want to spend most of your time in Central / Wan Chai / Causeway Bay, but getting into / out of the MTR is very easy. There are plenty of shops and grocery stores (Apita and Sogo) nearby if you\u2019re interested in buying your own meals / snacks.

I need not have been. This is a modern hotel with reasonable sized rooms especially for Hong Kong. I had read that some reviewers had problems with its location. Apart from the fact that taxi fares are very cheap in HK compared with US and European cities of comparable size, there is an excellent metro system which runs until 01.00 and is fast, clean and safe, not to mention the little publicised virtually non-stop bus service which is almost as quick if not quicker than the metro. So have no fears about the location. The staff ( with one small exception ) were ultra polite and helpful. Nothing was too much trouble for them. The restaurant for breakfast is a little expensive but the choice and availability of the buffet breakfast meant we ate three on 3 of our 8 days stay. The rooms are ultra modern and again I read of some complaints about the technology but unless you have the mental incapacity of a tabloid journalist or senior bank official the normal person should have no difficulty. The one small fault I had with the hotel ( although it would not stop me staying there on my next visit to Hong Kong) was the rooftop bar. The view is superb, the drinks choice wide but I found the opening hours very restrictive , especially on a Sunday Evening. The staff did not seem to be that interested in our party despite the fact that we were staying in the hotel for 8 nights and I detected a certain coolness as if somebody of my age ( accelerating towards 60) did not fit in with their idea of a client of the bar.

My point is that you can stay at EAST and still have a comprehensive shopping and dining experience in the local area. In terms of safety it is a clean and safe neighbourhood. The hotel design is very modern, which was great! The modern design sensibility of the lobby and public spaces is extended to the rooms, which are also very modern. It is true that the standard guest rooms adopt an open-plan attitude towards differentiating between the bedroom and the bathroom, but the materials and hardware used is top-notch, so I don't mind to use EAST's approach to room layout because it is so well-executed. I loved the rainshower, the extensive suite of electrical controls of manipulating room lights and blackout shades, large LCD tv with a great compliment of local and international channels, and comfy bed! I tried the in-room dining, and its true, keeping in the hotel's spirit of environmental sustainability, the in-room dining is delivered in biodegradable packaging and recyclable cutlery... one would think it would reduce the cost of room service, but apparently not... What can I say about the staff... good enough. Yes, they are dressed in casual attire in the style popularized by Apple. But like any large hotel, you will find average service by average staff.

I wander into Hotels.com but may be because of the smartphone default language, I was redirected into their Taiwan website. The trap is there, after checking the price and go to confirmation page, the amout of 550 dollars appear. Only in the fine print that it is stated in US dollars. I mistaken it as HK dollars.

Fine, I also mistaken that the third party can charge a room at US 180 rack rate and brand it as a bargain offer that cost US 550.

Flatscreen tv as standard with free WIFI (although i had some problems with my connection). They also have a ipod speaker alarm clock with a ipod touch for your use. This was a pleasant surprise as normally most hotels just provide the dock. The ipod touch lets you select music from the hotels library as well as browse the hotels facilities- strangely though you can't use it to browse the web. The room seems deceptively bright + spacious probably because of the \"open plan\" style of the bathroom which is divided from the bedroom by a thin glass panel. I liked our walk in wet room with rain shower. However my girlfriend did not like the toilet which has a frosted glass door- possibly a bit too intimate for some people. Service was great, the staff were polite, helpful + friendly. I only gave it 3 stars for value, because for \u00a3130 a night- although the hotel was certainly worth it- i'd be hard pressed to say that it was a bargain. I'd happily stay here again, all in all this is a great place for a young couple to stay.", "Date": "January 26, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Mumbai (Bombay), India", "Title": "\u201cUltra Modern Business Hotel\u201d", "Author": "amit511", "ReviewID": "UR123634565", "Content": "You would be surprised to see how much they can accommodate in a small space and how it still feels big enough even for stays that might be prolonged beyond couple of weeks.

No, it's not bad - it's just average. Yes, it is a bit cheaper than a lot of hotels in Central, and EAST would have you believe that it's ONLY because you're a bit out of the way and not because their amenities are less nice. Well, the rooms are starting to get worn out, furniture looks cheap and odd things here and there look like they could use some polishing or better maintenance. As for the views - only if you're on a high floor and the skies are extra clear. We were in a corner harbour view room on 19th floor - a pretty nice setup at this hotel - but as the days were hazy, all we could see clearly were peoples' apartment windows all around us. And I hear HK has a lot of hazy days, not least of all due to pollution. So don't count on views by any means. Very expensive restaurant - we chose to eat all our meals out. Next time, I would definitely stay somewhere else with more bang for the buck. It's hundreds of $$ per night that you have to spend on nice accommodations in this city whichever way you slice it, so might as well choose a more solid place. We also stayed one night at Marriott Sky Center near the airport, and that while that's even further out of the way than EAST, I felt it was a better deal overall - it was less money and better rooms. Regardless where you are in HK, you're going to spend a significant amount of time riding the MTR, so where you have to ride a few extra stops or not is not really a concern. On this note, a word of advice: if you're in HK for more than 1 day and intend to do some sightseeing, get a Visitor Octopus card (available right at the airport) - it's a super convenient way to get around.

We never entertained the thought of staying at a hotel that was not in the Central area until a friend told us about the East. With a bit of skepticism we gave it a try well over a year ago. Since then, we have been back numerous times and feel like it is a \"home away from home\". We just spent Christmas there with our adult son and loved our 6 day stay at The East. When the hotel learned we were returning, they pulled out all the stops to make us feel so welcome and we felt like VIPs. On all of our stays, we all noticed how the staff were extremely genuine and how each one could not do enough for us to make our time there a very comfortable and happy one. It is the attention to the small details that have made a big difference for us in deciding over and over to return to the East. Upon learning of my back problems and need to swim, the East ensured the pool temperature was as warm as possible for me in the cold month of December; the manager took time from her busy schedule to personally meet with us for a coffee; we were given extra coffee in our room every day after the first time when I asked the attendant in the hallway for another packet (i.e., he must have noted the room number and made a point to leave some extra packs each day of my stay); immediate replies to my various emails were always forthcoming from the staff when I had queries about the weather, the pool, the Christmas Day lunch menu... and so on. It is abundantly clear that the staff love their jobs and are happy at the East..in turn, this means the customer will be very well cared for. I felt like the hotel took great pains with all the details - the layout of the room is very good given the space constraints in HK; one is provided w a small ironing board and iron, gorgeous coffee maker and separate kettle to boil water, small fridge, hair dryer, wonderfully warm robes and slippers; complimentary water bottles.... they forgot nothing! I was very happy with the location of the Hotel - it was a short MTR ride to Central; the City Plaza shopping center is right across the road (bridge connection directly from the hotel); streets were nice enough to go for long walks in the evening (I'm an avid walker). The Feast restaurant is wonderful with a superb salad and appetizer buffet and dessert buffet (along with a main course choice if you wish) - again, excellent value. An a la carte menu is also available for those wanting lighter fare. We checked on pricing for some hotels in Central to compare them to the East. We could get 2 rooms at the East for less than one room at a centrally located hotel. Excellent value without question. I don't know that this a place to bring children as I am not sure what the Hotel provides for kids. It seemed more like an \"adult\" friendly hotel. So, if you are bringing younger children you might want to ask what is available to make their stay a happy one.

I checked out of the hotel at 5:30 AM yesterday The 9th of November, and it was a breeze, as was check in. I arrived Sunday evening and the check was very smooth. Though I had prepaid for the room, the check in clerk asked me for a credit card for incidentals and additional charges. But when I checked out I decided to pay in cash, so my final receipt said paid by cash. I had booked a urban view room because it was less costly than a harbor view room, and beyond that I've been to HK so many times that I had no need to pay for that view. Tip: to see the harbor take a ride on the Star Ferry (next to the IFC tower in Central). Yes the view was of apartments building across the way but Hong Kong is a vertical city - so you should expect that. By the way, I arrived at about 10:30 PM and I was given an upgrade from Urban View to Urban Corner view. This means you have two sides with nearly floor to ceiling windows. More blinds to close but less traffic in the hallway since you are at the end of the hallway. Since it was late, and I wasn't all that familiar with the Tai Koo neighborhood, I ordered a Club Sandwich from Room Service. It arrived in less than 10 minutes, beautifully wrapped and the sandwich came with french fries and a couple of tasty onion rings plus your own small (1 1/2 inch high ketchup bottle). By the way - it is 9 MTR stops on the Island Line from Central (Hong Kong Station) where the Airport Express train takes you to Tai Koo. TIP: To reach the hotel which is directly adjacent to Tai Koo MTR station - Take the D1 exit. This is a major plus as you have to walk only a few steps to get from the MTR station to the Hotel. The room has a big flat panel Panasonic TV and in addition to the free Wi-Fi in the room, you can also choose from assorted cables (HDMI or VGA) depending on your lap-top set up and connect your PC to the big screen TV. The desk had a very comfortable desk chair but the room wasn't big enough to have a side chair. So if you are a couple, one person would have to sit on the bed and the other on the desk chair. However the more expensive suites do have more seating. As some else wrote, the walk-in shower does not have a door. But it is quite spacious and the water is plentiful, very hot, and with superb water pressure. You can use the Rainfall shower head which is mounted in the ceiling, or you can you use the wall mounted hand held nozzle that has a flexible cable. The bathroom sink is small and not very deep so you can expect to have some splash. Just move the bath mat from in front of the shower to in front of the sink. The toilet has just a frosted glass door but there is a phone in the toilet room. I had the breakfast in the hotel's restaurant called Feast (That's East plus an F for food). As you arrive on the first floor, a hostess will escort you to a table. I ordered coffee and went to take items from the buffet. Now in every other hotel in Asia that had a buffet breakfast - by the time you return from the buffet with your food, the coffee has been poured and is waiting for you. Not this time. It took about 12 minutes for my first cup of coffee, and it took extra time for a menu (for hot and cooked on order breakfast items like eggs and french toast, pancakes etc.) to arrive, and then my second cup of coffee also seemed to take extra time. In fact, I had to ask a second time. Since I had not booked the room with the breakfast included, I was going to have to pay for it. When I called for the chit, the waiter came over and said that per his manager, they were apologizing for the lengthy delays, and that the breakfast would be on the house. No charge. While that was nice for me financially, I was more impressed that the manager knew about the delay and had waived the charges without me even complaining verbally. So the major plusses are the proximity to the MTR station and it is only 15 minutes to Central. The classy neighborhood with a huge shopping mall right next door which included a six-theater movie multiplex. The staff wore tee shirts, jeans and black topped sneakers, or the same with blazers, and everyone spoke excellent English and the front desk concierge people were terrific. The rooms were attractive and had a big big TV.

And I received an upgrade to a corner room (18th Floor) without asking for it. The minus was the slow breakfast service.

The room is well designed but not the bathroom. The sink is not deep enough, so everytime when i wash my face the water spill out and i need to put a towel on the floor everyday just is very ignoring. 3. although i turn off the water after I took a shower, but there are some water dripping from the ceiling. 4. the room service is not detail enough. After the daily cleaning, i still found the cup is dirty and there are still some hair in the bathroom. 5. The bed and cover sheets are not soft or i can say pretty rough. If i am not tired enough, i don't think i will be able to get some sleep on it. 6. slow internet and it always disconnect so i need to retype the password in order to go online. 7. The breakfast they provide doesn't taste that great, it doesn't worth with that money. The ham and the bacon are so dry and hard. 8. I don't like people working there wearing sneakers. I don't think it's appropriate to wear them in a 4 star hotel (i heard it's a 4 star). 9. security card key is not sensitive enough, everytime we need to try a couple of times in order to go upstairs through the elevator and get into the room. 10. the \"do not disturb\" button is not properly explained to us after we checked in. We have no idea what's the red light means and we have to figure it out by ourselves. likes: 1. well designed room accept the bathroom 2. a lot of channels to select from on the tv 3.

There is a \"trendy\" bar on the top floor with fantastic views, the food & drink is very good if not a little pricey. We found the breakfasts just ok. The rooms themselves I suspect you will either love them or hate them, not quite hating them this was our only real negative, they are best described as open plan with no designated bathroom area and with no privacy, as I say it will be great for some but not for others, you have to know your partner very well if you get my drift, having said all that I would certainly use the hotel again.", "Date": "October 24, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cExcellent\u201d", "Author": "CDinBKK", "ReviewID": "UR119646269", "Content": "I stayed at East after a mix up with another hotel.

It is brand new and the rooms are ultra modern. We had Harbour View rooms and the views were like something from a postcard - the whole width of the room was window!!! No need to worry about too much light to sleep - a block out blind made the room totally dark! The views from rooms on the city side were great too. Our room was fully equipped and quite large (not too sure about the toilet being behind frosted glass doors????) and the bed was totally comfortable and it was totally quiet! The Hotel offers FREE high speed wireless internet throughout the hotel, (about time the other 95% of hotels in the world provided this essential service!) catering especially for business travellers. But it was the amazing service we received from all the staff that made our stay so great. Nothing was too much trouble for them and their politeness and service was five star! Nowhere else in the world have we received such a standard of service - The East tops them all! There is a restaurant/cafe on the first level, serving meals all day at very reasonable prices (the high tea was superb!) and a unique bar on level thirty called \"Sugar\" which has to be seen to be believed! It is on top of the hotel and has indoor and outdoor seating with views out over Victoria Harbour and Kowloon Bay that will knock your socks off day or night! Drink prices were on a par with anywhere in HK and the staff can whizz up any tipple of your choice. It stays open until the wee small hours and serves meals and snacks as well. Suffice to say we spent quite some time there! The location of The East means it is quite a distance from the city centre, but with an MTR station located next door it took us about twenty minutes to get to Central on the fast, clean, cheap trains which run no longer than 5 minutes apart! There is the huge City Plaza shopping mall next door which has many restaurants and a food court, so there is no need to travel at all if you don't want to. Times Square shopping mall was 10 minutes by MTR and the up-market Pacific Place 15 minutes away, so shoppers can be in paradise very quickly!

Room Service - I love the way delivered it to the room in a recycle bag & everything. Very 2011. Good food & for roomservice not very pricey either! The room itself - We stayed in an urban view double room. Very 'zen!'. Didn't really enjoy the view though, I find the buildings across the street a little too urban looking (dirty!) but it's not like East has got something to say about the state of them buildings. Pretty much all buildings in HK are like that and I guess that's Urban eh? Now wish I would have booked a room on the other side but still very very pleased with the room we were in. The shower is amazing. Very powerful & love how it 'rains' on ur head! ;) The last 2 days of our stay I found the water to be a little bit smelly though! The bed was amazing, the matrass shaped to ur body! Area - There's a lot in and around the hotel. There's a lovely pool & gym on the 4th floor. There's of course the rooftop bar. And around the hotel there's City Plaza, which is basicly a massive mall with a cinema, a few restaurants & loads of shops (Toys R us, H&M, etc.) & the hotel is literally about 10 steps away from the Tai Koo metro station. Hospitality - Check out was at 12 which was great cos we only had to be at the airport at 7:30 in the evening. So they let us leave all of our luggage at the hotel after being checked out & we spent the day in Ocean Park. We got back to the hotel by 6 & even though we had been checked out for 6 hours they took us and our luggage to floor 4, where they let us use the Gym's bathrooms to shower, change clothers & get ready for our flight back to Amsterdam.

It has an open shower place, that is, your roommate can see you shower from the room, so might not be suitable for people who are shy. We have the urban view corner room, so not much of a view, just buildings. Will get a harbour view room next time! The room also has an iPod Touch, you can browse info and order room service with it. Room service - A small menu. Food is yummy and price is reasonable, except for the soup which the portion is just too small. They deliever the food to you in take away boxes which is different from other hotels. Staff - Very friendly, helpful and efficient. Location - on the Hong Kong Island, just 10-15 minutes taxi away from Central. It's linked to a huge shopping center and MTR station is right next door. Check out - very fast as usual.

Use the subway to walk to the Jusco department store - really good Japanese supermarket and small restaurants. We liked the ramen bar called Santokou. Also the huge mall next to hotel has a cheap eat section that had a huge variety of an asian food stalls. It was clean and reasonably priced.

True, the hotel is a bit far from Central as the bird flies, but in fact it only takes 10 minutes to get there by MTR (the station is literally next to the hotel) or taxi (depending on the traffic). A short walk will take you to the old fashioned tramway for a longer but oh so picturesque journey into the city. The immediate area around the hotel has plenty of shopping malls with shops such as Muji and Uniqlo, and restaurants including the excellent Peking Garden. The rooms are quite large, many with stunning views of Kowloon. Very comfortable beds, powerful shower spray, discreet but very attentive young staff. Very good restaurant for all three meals, including a varied breakfast menu with a large choice of delicious juices. The hotel must be doing well because the restaurant was packed for breakfast everyday at different times, but never to the point where one had to wait.

The hotel is beautiful, with the most gorgeous lobby we\u2019ve ever seen. The staff are all dressed in simple grey-green sweaters and black Converse: easily identified but nothing stuffy here! They all also wear permanent, genuine smiles and are, without a doubt, the most efficient hotel personnel we\u2019ve ever encountered, from check-in, the pool, the bar, and the front-desk phone, through to the astoundingly quick 2-minute check-out. We dealt pretty extensively with behind-the-scenes staff, as well, for reservations, questions, and a follow-up on our stay: needless to say, they wowed us equally. But our minds were truly blown by the room itself! Space in Hong Kong is always at a premium, of course, so the room is small. But who would know it? Clearly a lot of effort went into the interior design, and it shows. The bathroom vanity is separated from the bed by a semi-transparent, partial wall and mirror, so the space is separated enough for a feeling of privacy, but continues to feel open and spacious. The bed is oh-so-fluffy and comfortable and the rain shower a pure delight. Other pros: Great view from the 32nd floor bar, Sugar. Great gym equipment and a heated, outdoor pool. Simple card tap access for rooms and the elevator, a perfect balance between security and simplicity. Door-to-door airport shuttle for half the price of the Airport Express train with limousine-style seats and on-time service. Other cons: Our only disappointment was the food. The in-room coffee was truly substandard and undrinkable. The bar nibbles at Sugar also fell short of the mark, but a follow-up by the hotel (less than 24-hours after our check-out) gives us faith that they\u2019ll be working that out pronto.

This was our second stay and this time we were upgraded to a corner harbor view room which had a great view over to the old airport. The room is modern and compact. No signs of wear to be found. Nice Shower and single vanity. Storage space sufficient for two. Nice bathrobes. Some criticism on the room: You have to move the desk lamp in order to watch TV from the bed and the toilet door should be a bit more soundproof (even if you stay with your partner as in my case) instead of being frosted glass with wide gaps leaving no acoustic privacy whatsoever. Also it takes too long to open all the inside louvers as they are not motorized. All this didn't affect our stay here at all but it should be mentioned as these are not issues with the hotels category but simply some omissions during planning stage. The Gym is big with lockers and huge changing rooms. And service is very nice and forthcoming. Also I especially enjoyed the outside pool. The staff is young but very professional and forthcoming.

If your office is in Central, while HK is small, it does feel like forever braving the morning office crowd on the MTR given there are many other hotels closer to Central (ie.

The gym and pool is adequate. 24-hours gym is a great plus. Room service is decently (portions and price) and fast - one page menu that covers the basics.

When I asked where I could find the luggage cradle, the Hotel Experience Manager (I'm not making this up) told me there wasn't one. It spoils the decor. The Hotel Experience Manager was in my room to discuss the half-glass of red wine that I spilled on the carpet a few nights previous. Although I soaked it up with a towel, the hotel claimed they could not clean it, and wanted to charge me $1500 to \"replace the carpet\". The (non-cleanable) carpet, it seems, is part of the experience. The wineglass hit the floor because the tiny Zen tables on either side of the bed are crowded with electronic gizmos (on one side) and the phone (on the other). When I balked at this inane fee, the East reduced it to $1000 (HKD).

But to be fair to East Hotel, we should review it on its own merits. We stayed in East Hotel for six nights, in two different categories of rooms, the Harbour Queen and the Urban Corner room. Mixed feelings is how we would like to describe this hotel. On the plus side, it is a brand new hotel located at a residential district with almost everything you need, like restaurants, supermarkets and shops of all kinds. The design is striking without being overwhelming to the visual sense. The check-in and restaruant staff are friendly and eager to help, though the guys responsible for security at the entrance may look a bit coolish and distant. Both categories of rooms have all the amenities you would expect in a four-star hotel. Both are of a good size. It is very good that wi-fi and local calls are complimentary. The bed and the pillows are comfy and the writing desk is of the right size. The complimentary nougat and the iHome system are nice touches. Of course, the unobstructed harbour view in the Harbour Queen room is superb! East Hotel would have received an unreserved thumbs-up from us but for a few misses which we think inconvenienced our stay. First, we could not switch on the lights in the toilet without switching on all the main lights in the room, thanks to the rather unconventional lighting system. This means that, every morning, I had to turn all the light on for shaving and washing while my partner was still asleep. Just imagine how annoying this could be. Second, there is only one chair in the room. That would not have been a problem if there had been a single guest. With two guests staying, it would be inevitable for one of us to sit on the bed, which we were quite reluctant to do for hygiene reasons. This may sound like our quirk, but we believe that both rooms were big enough for at least a stool of some sort. (We did, in fact, request a second chair, but were told the hotel had none!) Third, there is no glass partition in the shower area in the Urban Corner room. I know that this is design adopted in some hotels (including the Upper House), but it did not seem to work in a compact room because, with only one airconditioning/heating area control, it was not possible to have a shower without feeling cold. (It was rather unfortunate that there was a cold spell during our stay.) East Hotel is overall a good hotel. We would definitely stay there again.
