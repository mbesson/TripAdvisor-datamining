The receptionist took us to our room and apologised for a small stain on the carpet (I hadn't noticed and it was gone a few hours later!) The room was beautifully decorated, the bed was very comfortable indeed and the small bathroom was nice too. The pain au chocolat at breakfast were absolutely delicious!

There is a feeling of being in someone's home.Although it has a freshness,masses of colour and a good deal of elegance the staff,the ambience and the overall intimacy of the place lends itself to a feeling of well being and comfort. The staff try very hard to please,the concierge is outstanding,the location is good.Breakfast is plentiful and very nice,not outstanding,but perfectly acceptable. I take the point from the minority of reviewers that (some of) the rooms are a bit on the small side but they are exquisitely decorated and consequently deserving of praise. This hotel wins on the grounds that it is something different,a fresh addition to the myriad of design hotels that tend to work to a format.The Daniel has clearly been a labour of love for the owners.Not for them some anonymous,bland decor..instead every detail,lamps,car[ets,mirrors and even the luxurious supplies in the bathroom have clearly been painstakenly devised. I wish I could give this hotel four and a half stars.For me it just falls short of the 5 but is a long way ahead of the 4. The only factor that prevents me giving maximum marks is the relative smallness of the rooms but dont forget they are furnishes superbly. This hotel is a must for visitors with a healthy but not endless budget. A terrific hotel,great staff,Allez daniel !!

I have been to Paris alot but the last few time Danielle was the place I went to. I fell in love with boutique hotels ever since then! the location is amazing on a quiet street but 2 minutes walk from the champs with its noise, cafe, shopping metro stations and everything. Staff is amazing and friendly and the service is personal, they cater to you! Everyone knows ur name and what you like best, for example I used the laptop and internet after breakfast so it was ready everyday at that time. Rooms are a bit small but decor is eccentric and bright, the suites are better if you like more space. bathrooms is magnificent with great soaps and shampoos wonderful clean towels. This hotel is concerned with the details so there are alot of little fancy details in the room, bathroom and services. they can tell you ur way around paris from rest reccomendations, the easiest way to go to some place...etc AMAZING STAY looking forward to my next visit there, its one of the things I go back to Paris for now!", "Date": "November 22, 2006"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Hotel Daniel", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g187147-d197542-Reviews-Hotel_Daniel-Paris_Ile_de_France.html", "Price": "$387 - $600*", "Address": "<address> <span rel=\"v:address\"> <span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">8 Rue Frederic Bastiat</span> | <span class=\"extended-address\">entre les Champs Elysees et la rue du Faubourg Saint Honor&eacute;</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:postal-code\">75008</span> <span property=\"v:locality\">Paris</span></span>, <span class=\"country-name\" property=\"v:country-name\">France</span> </span> </span> </address>", "HotelID": "2514939", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/ProviderThumbnails/dirs/40/0a/400a7a8c380c444b156d4add3a049a751large.jpg"}}
