{"Reviews": [{"Content": "Neither \"New\" nor \"Hotel\".... The New Windsor is essentially an extended stay for the homeless - not a hotel in the traditional sense. It is NOT new - It was old 30 years ago when I worked in that area. I give it a neutral rating because it delivers on what it promises. A safe place for the down and out to stay. Nothing less and certainly nothing more.", "Date": "Dec 31, 2006", "ReviewID": "UR239646240", "Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "3", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "JerryPPhoenix"}, {"Content": "Horrible Staff I tried calling this hotel just to find out how many rooms the property had, and was hung up on three times. The front desk agent was sorely mistaken that I was trying to sell her something when the only thing I was trying to do is decide whether or not to stay there. She was rude, unprofessional, and uneducated. If this is any sign of how my stay at the Windsor would be, I'd rather sleep on a bed of nails.", "Date": "Jul 21, 2004", "ReviewID": "UR465669224", "Ratings": {"Service": "-1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "-1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "1", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "-1", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member"}], "HotelInfo": {"HotelURL": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g31310-d119321-r6528065-New_Windsor_Hotel-Phoenix_Arizona.html", "HotelID": "119321", "Price": "Unkonwn"}}
