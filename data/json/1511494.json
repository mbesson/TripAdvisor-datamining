While it is relatively new, modern, clean and convient, for a business person trying to be productive 24x7, it really fell short. The ONLY reason to choose this hotel is because the price is pretty good -- about US$70. My feeling is just like Dan801 and TLumbi; this hotel is too small, too basic; too much value and not enough hotel! The first problem was finding the place. Three out of three taxi drivers had never heard of it! Plus, there are TWO other Value Hotels on Balestier, both very small Chinese-style hotels. So tell the driver it's right off the PIE, Thomson Road exit, and it's just two streets down from Thomson on the left. On the plus side -- this is a pretty convenient location. During my visit I drove all over Singapore, and ended up in the middle of the island every night, right near this hotel. Once you finally get to the hotel, check-in is fast and easy because there's always an army of people behind the check-in counter. But here's the second surprise -- the \"Delux\" rooms which I ordered on-line DON'T HAVE WINDOWS! If you want windows, that's a $10 a day upgrade. The hallways are uncarpeted, which means noise in hallways outside your room echoes loudly. The room was tiny, and more than once I crashed into the coffee-counter on the way to the toilet. There are no amenities like luggage racks, soaps and such. The worst offense, in my mind, is the awful design of making the shower and the bathroom one room; once you use the shower, the toilet is covered with soapy water, the floor is wet and your shaving kit is soaked. I was able to get the WIFI to work, but there was only ONE electrical outlet in the whole room, designed to serve the teapot. So I sat on the bed and typed my emails -- acceptable maybe for one evening, but not for a week. In the spirit of full disclosure, I did discover one bright-spot: the hotel has a TERRIFIC swimming pool and a work out room on the 7th floor. See photo; it's really nice. The hotel has no food service. For food, you go to the adjacent restaurant and pay S$11.80 for breakfast. Dinner was also offered, a bit expensive for what you get, but they had some nice wines from Chile and New Zealand, so it wasn't a total waste. If I had more time, I would have explored the neighborhood and I'm sure I could have found better foods at lower prices. Overall, while this might be fine for school groups or 20-somethings backpacking around the globe, from my perspective it was pretty awful and I will not be coming back.", "Date": "April 14, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Singapore, Singapore", "Title": "\u201cWonderful Stay\u201d", "Author": "sanju s", "ReviewID": "UR127390342", "Content": "We started our trip from singapore at the Value Thomson and loved our stay.

As a couple traveling Asia, I have concluded our standards are much different than the other reviewers on this site. A hotel with \"Value\" in the name combined with a price of $90+ USD... our expectation is that it will be clean, modern, and comfortable. With no closet and no room for our luggage to be out of the walk way, comfortable scored very low. The rooms were not insulated so this ensured that you hear the other clients and hotel staff moving carts throughout the night... again, not very comfortable. The shower next to the toilet took some adjusting (fine), but the smell and mildew on the bathmat was just horrendous. It contained a plastic base, that was never changed and sat in a damp bathroom with no window. This is not what I would expect from a $90+ a night hotel... anywhere in the world. Not to mention, that we had to pay extra for a \"WINDOW\". The internet cut when too many people were in the hotel. As business travelers, this was quite frustrating. The staff was not very helpful on this issue. Coffee was watered-down and not good so we chose to walk 10 minutes to get a decent cup of coffee. I will say, the hotel lobby was very inviting and clean. The doorman always had a smile and the elevator was wonderful. The pool... it was a pool. Nothing above standard. Basic layout, some trees that were placed in odd locations, with standard lounge chairs. The location of the hotel is tucked in the middle of construction zones. Makes it a bit unpleasant to try and relax at the pool after battling the traffic. If clients continue to accept below-standard accommodations, this will never improve in Singapore. It is a shame that in 2012, $90+ USD a night gets you semi-crap with a clean bed.

It was the most spartan hotel room I'd ever seen, as well as the second-tiniest, so much so that I had a hard time finding somewhere to place my umbrella so it could dry. The bed was definitely on the firm side and had only one coverlet, though fortunately the room's thermostat worked. The walls were thin, so I couldn't have slept if I hadn't brought earplugs. My three biggest complaints, however, related to the bizarre shower, the unfriendly staff, and the absence of the promised breakfast. The shower is merely a showerhead in the bathroom: no shower curtain, no enclosure of any kind, and the water covered the entire bathroom floor before reaching a drain in the far corner. Why would they design such a deficient shower? They don't provide soap either, so I was glad I brought my own, though they do provide bath gel and shower. The staff were very unfriendly and were unable or unwilling to answer basic questions. They also don't have any maps or tourist brochures at the hotel, nor do the staff seem to realize why tourists would want and expect such things. So be sure to grab a map and some brochures before you leave the airport because I found only one tourist kiosk in all of Singapore (on Orchard Road). Perhaps the staff haven't traveled outside Singapore and therefore aren't familiar with showers or hotel desks in the rest of the world. Finally, I had reserved my room and prepaid for it using a well-known online third-party company; I paid extra for breakfast to be included. Upon arrival, I discovered that there was no restaurant in the hotel, and to get the included breakfast I needed a coupon from the front desk, but they had no record that I had paid for it, and the surly staffer didn't have any interest in trying to confirm it with the online company. So I was quite irritated to be charged extra for the non-existent breakfast. The room included a water-boiling pot (look for its base inside the desk drawer); a television with several channels, though I found only one in English; and two complimentary bottles of water, replenished daily. There wasn't a refrigerator. The hotel certainly doesn't have amenities such as a gym, pool, business center, or room service. There are two Internet terminals in the lobby, both of which charge by the minute. There are no tourist attractions in the neighborhood of the hotel, though there is a small convenience store around the corner. The hotel is about 8 to 10 minutes' walk from the nearest subway stop, the Novena MRT station, which is by far the easiest way to travel within Singapore. Although the Value Hotel Thomson is located on Balestier Road, be advised that there is also a different hotel called the Value Hotel Balestier, so don't confuse the two. I wouldn't stay there again, and it's an adequate value only by comparison with even more expensive hotels elsewhere in Singapore. However, if you lower your expectations and consider it a backpacker venue rather than a mid-range hotel, you might be content with it.", "Date": "November 23, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Delhi", "Title": "\u201cunimpressed :(\u201d", "Author": "SB1102", "ReviewID": "UR120709452", "Content": "i went there with my family for a week-long vacation... to sum up the experience, it wasn't impressive +ves- the rooms are very tidy and the french window makes for a nice view. reception staff was very courteous and helpful. -ves- the rooms here are very very small, rather cramped for water, they provide only self-branded bottled water and charge a significant amount for it hotel is located quite distant from city centre and most of the tourist locations. further, it is located in a residential area. so finding traveller's conveniences like restaurants etc. was quite a trouble. overall, i wouldn't advise anyone to stay in this hotel", "Date": "November 17, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Quezon City, Quezon City, Philippines", "Title": "\u201cEvery space counts - very small bathroom\u201d", "Author": "Jeremy C", "ReviewID": "UR120692893", "Content": "Was looking for an affordable place in Singapore while staying away from the red light district and \"ho-tels\" Stayed here last week and reserved for a window room.

So we walked about 7 minutes from the Novena MRT station to this hotel, after getting directions from a local there. I liked the fact that Singapore has wide pedestrian paths which make walking and running travelers-friendly. We arrived at the hotel after spotting the sign of the building and checked in as expected. The hotel interior was kinda chic, but small. The staff was not really friendly, but the check-in process was smooth nevertheless. The room that we got was small and compact, but really clean. I adored the large bay window where you could sit beside it on the elevated window-sitting area, and we could put all of our personal belongings and knick knacks from the trip. The cupboard and the makup desk were very tiny and I was amazed by the space that was built to cater for this 2 pieces of furniture. Though it's a budget hotel, it still provided 2 bottles of drinking water everyday throughout our stay to quench our thirst, and I think this was essential because one would get hydrated easily while travelling and exploring the wonders of the city. More importantly, the bathroom was clean and quite new-looking, chic even, due to its squarish basin and neutral-tone wall & floor tiles. Although the whole area would be wet after showering, I still gave credit to its simplicity and cleanliness. Accessibility to the city and other parts of Singapore was not a problem, as buses easily stop by the hotel to pick up passengers to their destinations. If bus is not your thing, then just walk briskly for 7 minutes (or normal walking for 12 minutes) to the nearest MRT station (ie. Novena MRT station) where you can easily access to most parts of Singapore. In a nutshell, this is a recommended hotel to go to if you have a budget constraint.

When I walked into the room, I was surprised at how small the room was. We could barely find space for two small pieces of luggage. Two people can't possibly walk in that room at the same time, one has to sit on the bed if the other one needs to walk, even to go to the bathroom. Speaking of the bathroom, it's also very small. It's one of those all in one bath, shower, rolled into one, very basic. The room is also very noisy, you can hear just about everything happening when people walk in the hallway or open their door. NO FREE BREAKFAST. If you spend most of your time taking pictures, shopping away from the Hotel, you might find it to be just what you are looking for. If you consider the price of a 5 star hotel in center town which can run into hundreds of dollars per night, Value hotel is as the name described.. If you decide to stay there, try to use the bus to go to town. It's very easy to take a bus (Bus 131 or 145) which costs about SPD1.60 per person to the center of town. The bus is air conditioned and it also allows you to see what else is in the city. A taxi ride would cost you 17.00 dollars in the day time for the same distance. There's plenty of restaurants around the hotel to challenge your pallet. I was able to take advantage of the FREE wifi internet connection from the room although they have PC's downstairs for you to use free of charge. If you decide to use the wifi Just ask the desk clerk for the password before you go to your room if not, you will have to go back to the front desk to get it, they won't give it to you over the phone.

It seems unfortunate that in Singapore such modest expectations don't come with modest price tags. The good news though is that apart from hotel prices, everything else in Singapore is very reasonably priced. As for location, it's not walkable to the main sights, but you can catch frequent buses near the hotel or take taxis. Buy an EziCard (for transport) from the many 7/11 stores nearby. Cafes and restaurants abound in the local area, so it's fine for relaxing after a hard day sight seeing. My verdict is that the hotel is value for money (by Singapore standards) but if your budget can stretch a bit further then staying in Chinatown would be better in tems of access to attractions and ease of public transport.", "Date": "August 21, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Vancouver, Canada", "Title": "\u201cSmall spaces but affordable price\u201d", "Author": "Ewaizel", "ReviewID": "UR117005028", "Content": "You will have only a bed, small table and that's it.

I had previously stayed at the Aqueen Lavender, which is also a budget hotel in Singapore but the Value Hotel has even more basic rooms.

The whole room conveyed a sense of being low-maintenance and of not requiring a large amount of effort to turn-around. It was a very basic room, even by budget hotel standards. The room was clean and had a good shower facility, which was Grohe-branded. However, the shower was not separated from the toilet area, which was something that the Aqueen Lavender was able to provide. The room had a window and a view onto the street but it wasn\u2019t anything special.

The pool was very large and there were good views from the rooftop pool. The gym, however, was quite small. The hotel is located in a reasonable location because at night there were still a few places to eat closeby but these were only serving Asian food. Being a budget hotel in Singapore, it was located in a slightly seedy area, which seems to be an unavoidable issue when staying in Singaporean budget hotels.

What was dissapointing is the size of the room. I never expected it to be that small. The single bed is just fitting our 13 yr old girl, so what more for a husband and wife in a single bed. I need not say that there is no room for another mattress on the floor. The toilet and bath is for kids under 10 yrs old, practically no space to move. Anyway, sleep is good after a tiring day.

Coming from a hospitality background I know I could not expect 5-star hotel rooms, venues or service coming to this hotel.

On top of that the hotel is incredibly noisy, so don't think about sleeping in. The main point of criticism is the service, or more so the lack of service. There seems to be no communication between any of the managers, no body seems to have a clue what is going on and the handling of complaints is just terrible. * It took them 30 minutes to find my reservation - never had any explanation why it took so long. * Taxi's that have been ordered the day before, because I was on a tight schedule regarding meetings were not called or were given away to other guests. * There is no wireless internet - they have a signal but apparently is \"hasn't been working for months\". You have to use a cable but also that internet is down most of the time. Working from the hotel is thus virtually impossible. * Internet was included in my room, but they have the password change every day which you have to pick up from the counter on a piece of paper. Every single day they tried to charge me $4 for that. In the end I tried working on the public computers in the lobby, once again tried to charge me for it. * There is no directory in any room, so you have to find all the opening closing times, the telephone numbers, the internet policy, the tv channels (BTW no DVD player) etc. out by going to the reception every time. * The gym: two fitness machines of which one was out of order. * Breakfast is absolutely horrible. You have to have breakfast next door in a restaurant which is run by the most rude person I have ever met. He is actually scolding guests for not finding a sauce that is on the table, inside is closed 45 minutes before the buffet ends so you have to sit in the sun outside, the food is almost empty 30 minutes before the buffet closes and the quality of the food is terrifying. * Swimming pool: nice, but quite small and closes at 7 so you can't have a refreshing dive in if you had meetings all day. * On top of this, during my entire stay of 8 days - nobody actually said sorry for anything. Everything was apparently out of their hands and they just ignored any complaint I had. Trying to talk to one of the managers, and asking if they would treat everyone staying at their hotel for 8 days, taking up 3 rooms like this without offering any excuses or not even a simple beer or whatever - the response was: \"We don't have beer.\" In conclusion, the hotel could be great value for money, but the terrible service is not even worth the little money you pay.", "Date": "March 23, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Kortrijk, Belgium", "Title": "\u201ccould be better\u201d", "Author": "martinlizard", "ReviewID": "UR100924721", "Content": "nice clean hotel , not well located though if you don't like to walk or spend lots of money on taxis .

But after that I think I never heard a single \"good morning\" or \"hello\" albeit the number of times I walked through their doors. Just a bit more warmth won't hurt. :) And oh, it would be fantastic if they can offer free wifi. To sum it all up, I would definitely recommend this hotel to anyone who wants a reasonably priced comfortable, clean hotel.

Naturally I wanted a budget hotel with basic amenities and hence I chose this place mainly because of the free internet (cable, not wireless). Getting to the hotel: I used MRT from Changi International Airport to Dhoby Ghaut then changed train to reach Novena station. The whole trip costs less than S$2 and it's cost effective for those who don't have heavy luggages. Upon reaching the station, you can walk to the hotel which takes about 15-20 minutes depending on your pace. The hotel is easily spotted from the main road. Check-in service: The receptionist was courteous and professional. I arrived earlier than expected (around 12.30pm) and I was told that they needed to clean the room first so I left my luggage and went out to explore the nearby shopping mall (Velocity and Novena Square). Room: The room is somewhat small with two single beds. I opted for the no window room to save an extra S$10 per day. The room looks clean and new. The beds are comfortable with clean sheets and I didn't experience any bedbug bites throughout my stay. A wall mounted LCD TV is available with over 10 channels and directly below the TV is a mini cabinet to hang your clothes (with irremovable hangers). A mini table is situated next to the TV and complimentary 2 bottles of water are given every day. There is also an electric kettle with cups and complimentary instant tea and coffee sachets and a hair dryer placed inside the drawer. A telephone is also available if you need to make a call. The walls are unfortunately thin and you can always hear people talking outside the room. Thankfully my room was at the end of the hallway so it wasn't too bad. Toilet/shower room: All in one room. Very small and not suitable for large people. Once you start showering, everything will be wet. Complimentary shower gel, shampoo, toothbrush and toothpaste are given. Toilet papers are also available. Towels are provided and changed daily. Summary: For S$119 per night, this hotel is not too bad. I would have chosen a cheaper hotel but I wasn't too sure about the cleanliness. I didn't use the gym or the swimming pool so I can't comment on that. Check-out time is at 12pm and you'll get an automated call to remind you of this. There are many local eateries near the hotel but if you prefer Western cuisines, you are better off going to the city. Convenience stores are also within the vicinity. If you need a taxi, you can always ask the staff for assistance otherwise try your luck flagging one at the roadside.", "Date": "December 7, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Kota Kinabalu, Malaysia", "Title": "\u201cQuite ok and acceptable\u201d", "Author": "cookies_secret", "ReviewID": "UR88886797", "Content": "1.

Although the rooms are very small due to space constraint in Singapore, but it is very clean, tidy and the bed is comfortable. The location is also good, about 10mins walk to novena mrt station and there are many buses that can take you to orchard. Breakfast are not included but you can pay SGD10/person for it. The reception told us we can have a look at the breakfast before deciding to have it. However, we did not have a chance as we woke up late everytime. The room comes with complimentary bottled drinking water and basic toiletries like shampoo, shower gel, toothbrush and shower cap. We did not have much encounter with the staffs so not sure about their service. The only negative thing is the thin wall/door of the room which is practically not sound proof. When your neighbours come back and open their doors, it is as if someone is going to open your door. I got scared a few times during my first night but got used to it after that. the housekeeping staffs can start their work pretty early about 8am and they can be heard clearly and disturbed our sleep. Besides that, our room has poo smell when we check in and also the next day after housekeeping. We were wondering if the housekeeping staff has used the bathroom or the bathroom has bad air ventilation. However, the smell went away after awhile when we kept the door open so it was not a big issue. Overall, this hotel is really value for money considering they really maintain the cleanliness of the rooms which is very important for a hotel.

The lobby was small. The front desk staff were brisk and fast in doing their job. There was very little time spent on cordial conversations which suits me fine although some tourist may find it impolite. There were no bell boys so you would have to carry your own luggage to your room. The hotel staffs we saw around the hotel need to be taught basic pleasantries though. None of they bothered to greet us with a simple hello or good morning during our 5 days stay there. We stayed in deluxe rooms and a triple room which both had windows in it. The deluxe rooms had windows overlooking the pool area. The toilet and bath was larger than for the superior room but there was no division between the wet and dry area. Rooms were smaller than luxury hotels but acceptable. The hotel is located far from tourist destination but if you do not mind riding the bus/mrt like the locals then you will not have any trouble with this hotel. The bus stop is just a block or two away and is really quite fun to ride. What you should do once at the airport is get a singapore tourist pass which cost S$8 per day so you can ride buses and mrt for free. It is really worth it. We did not have breakfast in the hotel so I can't say anything about the food. The hotel was fully booked when we were there and they did not have enough room to offer breakfast to everyone. That wasn't a problem since there were this hawker's place just accross the street and a lot more further on where you can get meals for $2-5. The only thing I do not like in this hotel is the noise.

Although you can have other hotel rooms for less, we thought that the rooms we booked at Value Hotel Thomson was worth what we paid for them.

The hotel is easily accessed by both bus and train -- and the walk to and from the station introduces you to several restaurants that pack in the local crowds (and that's always a good indication of a restaurant's reputation). The hotel is also located in a residential district, so if you're the sort of person who values a good night's rest this may be your idea of a good hotel. We only had two slight complaints: 1) there was no fridge in the room -- and given how hot it can get in Singapore cold drinks are a must so I hope the management takes this into consideration; and 2) the shower stall is nonexistent, so the water gets everywhere -- you have to wait for a couple of minutes for the floor to dry out before you can use the bathroom again (good thing we bought flip flops!)", "Date": "April 8, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Toronto, Canada", "Title": "\u201cExcellent stay\u201d", "Author": "Traveler2009", "ReviewID": "UR60356268", "Content": "I travel adventure style, but as years go by, I more and more appreciate comfort. Travelling for business or on my own budget, I always look for a good deal. That being said I have looked long and hard for an affordable and comfortable hotel in Singapore. If you are reading this review, you likely know that Singapore is a destination on the relatively expensive side. I have chosen Value Thomson based on the ratings given on tripadvisor.com and have been very happy with the choice. Just to clarify that there are many Value hotels in Singapore, this review refers only to Value Thomson hotel! As mentioned in other reviews the room is small. On the other hand if you travel carry on only, like I do, or with a reasonable size luggage, the room is very well configured and just about the right size. You have what you need for a short term stay, very clean room and bathroom, free coffee and water, good temperature controls. The hotel is not located right beside a subway line, but it is located very close to one, three bus stops away to be more specific. By many standards, these three bus stations are really walking distance, about 5 minutes walk. I have used both taxis and public transit extensively while staying at Value Thomson. The hotel is located conveniently for both, and while taxis in Singapore are affordable, I really feel that using public transit in Singapore is a very good choice. I only wish, I was not so jet lagged and able to use it more. As already mentioned, the rooms and the entire facility for that matter are very clean. Staff, is efficient and very helpful. Based on some other reviews I was somewhat reluctant choosing this hotel as some reviews pointed out the fact the staff, is not exactly helpful. My experience did not confirm that, they were just about perfect. Reception desk was always well staffed, they helped me with suggestions ranging from directions for a first time visitor to Singapore to general advice on food choices or general advice on how to reach a destination. Also worth mentioning is the fact that I had a very late arrival, 6AM. Although the hotel will try to provide a room for early ( very late) arrivals, if available, I did not want to take any chances after 38 hours of travel, so I specifically booked a room early and made sure is available. I have also requested, high floor away from elevators, like I normally do for any hotels, no matter how cheap or expensive. Based on hotel design, all rooms are away from elevators. They delivered spot on the high floor, insulating me from any street noises. Comparing them with any other hotels, I would rate Value Thomson 10/10 for service. The hotel has a pool on the 7th floor, very clean, and pretty much a must after a long day of running around in the hot and humid Singapore. Some reviewers pointed out that some rooms on the 7th floor are noisy. I agree and because of traffic you are better of avoiding them, but only if they are on the way to the pool! The hotel configuration means that only about 3 or 4 rooms are actually in the high traffic area leading to the pool. The hotel has 100+ rooms overall! The one area to be concerned about is noise from other rooms. That could be a problem, but not because of thin walls as is usually the case while travelling in Asia. In this hotel, all floors are ceramic. While it is easy to keep the floors clean, it really makes it for an overall noisier hotel. The noise comes from the hallways, nevertheless if noise is a concern for you, you may want to bring ear plugs. While I would not recommend it, because of room size, there are families with children staying in this hotel; they were the noisiest of all travelers, while trying to get in and out of their rooms. Internet is available, wired and wifi, but at 10$ per day you are better off to go across the street at an internet cafe. Last but not least, I would like to bring out the very important subject of food. Under no circumstances should a traveler be concerned about food in Singapore. Out of all the places I have ever traveled to, Singapore is by far the best place to eat, period. Hawker centers are definitely the way to go at any time of the day. As far as eating, while staying at Value Thomson, I would recommend you cross the street and eat at one of the several eateries around. There are no bad choices really. The hotel restaurant is also good, is just that it is more expensive (20USD vs. 4USD) Overall Value Thomson is a very good choice especially if you are on a budget.", "Date": "April 4, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Malaysia", "Title": "\u201cReasonable\u201d", "Author": "PTCC", "ReviewID": "UR59786804", "Content": "Well, it is a budget hotel.

After checking reviews I was skeptical but I needed Free WiFi and a pool which is a hard order to fill in Singapore without spending 150 US up. Was also interested to see what the 81 group is doing as they move forward by upscaling a little bit. As I've lived in Thailand for 20 years, own a resort and a couple guesthouses there too, and visited Singapore at least 25 times in that period, I've seen a few places around Sing. Most of my old favorites have been remodeled and are now out of the budget range at 200 US up which I refuse to pay, that's why I had to build Pacific Club Resort in Phuket so me and my friends would have a nice place to stay there at reasonable prices, might have to do the same in Singapore soon:-). We stayed 4 nights and I tried 2 room styles and inspected them all (see booking tip below). Will be visiting Siloso Resort at Sentosa next and let you know how that turns out. Pros * Free Wifi, had problem in one room and they switched rooms for us immediately. * Pool is OK, water quality was great, apparently ozone and salt water purification, no chlorine smell and crystal clear. Nice deck and good sized especially for a budget hotel. Forget the treadmills and bike in the gym, you'll get plenty of exercise while touring Singapore unless you take cabs everywhere. * 7-11 and food courts within walking distance * New property, everything works * Good LCD TV and channels work although the TV seems to be slightly misplaced off to the side of the bed center line. * Fits the budget without staying in a so called \"love hotel\" or old flea bag place which would be the next step down budgetwise. * Didn't have any problem with \"thin walls\" mentioned in some other reviews, during the day you can hear people moving around if they pass your room, but not much and it's not any big deal * Staff were fine, some better than others, but if you worked the front desk with 4-5 other people in a 360 room hotel, you might have a few rough days too :-) It's not like anyone is sitting on their butts and most of the time they were great. Housekeeping friendly although they're all imported and don't speak English. Con's * A bit far from everything, but generally in Singapore you're going to spend money on cabs, MRT, etc. Usually after a long day it's hard to keep up the saving since you'll be beat so I end up taking a cab home no matter where I stay, so it's simply a matter of telling the driver where you want to go. Going out in the morning, take any bus at the stop just around the corner from the hotel and you can get to Orchard or several MRT stations within minutes for 1 Sing buck, no big deal. Coming back by taxi from downtown cost about 5 Sing Dollars, not much more than an MRT ride for two. * Breakfast is pretty basic and most people will be disappointed with it unless coffee, rice, baked beans, and eggs fried with tomato sauce on untoasted bread is your main thing (did find a toaster on the second to last day :-). But it's cheap (about 6 Sing Dollars) and it's optional on most booking sites. If you want a proper breakfast, don't take it and use the food courts or do special things with all the money you saved by staying here, like visiting some of the killer buffets in the 5 star hotels or B-Fast at the Singapore Zoo, great start to a really good place to go for a day. * Also dinner at the restaurant seemed a bit higher priced than options within a few minutes walk. It was always full, but we didn't try on account of the price. IMPORTANT BOOKING TIP They have four room types, the folks with the worst comments obviously didn't know this and thought by booking a superior room they were getting the best. Price range I found was from 85 Sing$ (cheapest standard room) to 130 Sing$ (triple room) * Dont' take the standard or superior rooms unless you don't mind a really small bathroom in a tiny room (and in the case of the standard room, no window), just pay the small extra and get a Deluxe (really fine for couples) or Triple for the extra space and nicer bathroom with plenty of space it's well worth it. You'll have to hunt around or contact the hotel directly as most 3rd party sites only offer the cheaper room types. BTW, triple room is OK for family with one kid. Hope this review helps singles or couples who are trying to do Singapore on less than 125 US/day for room, food, Wifi, and basic transportation (no drinking or smoking:-).

We ended up staying 4 due to our flight being changed. We chose this hotel as we wanted somewhere with a pool to relax during the day as we had been to Singapore only a month before so we weren't bothered about being in the centre of everything. The hotel had this and a couple of running bikes that they call the gym so we thought great this will do. Now having read the reviews before i expected the staff to be lacking in the smiles etc and they werent very cheery at all. However whenever i needed something they did assist but all to often it seemed forced instead of willingly. The walls are very thin, and i echo what another review says that you may actually think someone is in your room its that thin. However most nights its quiet as it seems people sleep early and we were away from the lifts right at the end of the corridor on the 3rd floor. The room itself is small but we found it fine as it had everything you need and enough room to put your bags on the window ledge and around the room. Big window in room was nice too. Aircon was fine and worked well, if a little loud but ear plugs in and you're fine. Bathroom is small but fine for what it is, clean and water was hot and good pressure. Tv was LCD screen with good selection of channels, ESPN, HBO among others. Location is a 10min walk to Novena MRT which is loacted in a shopping mall with good selection of eateries. (Orchard road is 2 stops from Novena.) If you walk down to the MRT you can go to Union square shopping Mall which is 2min walk underground or situated across the road but harder this way due to traffic.

Actually, being in my line, I want to experience myself this hotel as it was most quoted as one of the good budget hotel and would like to put this hotel under recommendation for my business clients. When we arrived, the door man smiled to us..The lobby was simple, clean and chic for a budget hotel...The malay girl that check us in seemed new but made the check in fast..Upon-check in, there was another guest whom was asking for the $69.00 promotion that was hanged largely outside the hotel, only to find out that the promotion is over...u guys need to put down the banner if the promotion is gone dear... We had our room on the 6th level.The room was nicely designed, I had no problem with anything but well, the toilet is really small...hmm..if you live in Singapore, it would be the size of your HDB storeroom. We tried the pool later, it was ok, although we have to bring our own room towels as there is no towels provided by the pool. After the swim, while resting in the room, i realized there's a leak on the ceiling, but since it was nothing serious, we just ignore.Our sleep was ok as there's not much noise around except if the person next door is entering the room. Everything was fine up till checking out. My partner went to the reception to hand over the room card. Only one person was on duty, a young chinese guy, wearing specs, if i'm not wrong red white frame (you should know who you are). Upon giving the card, he was at the computer, My partner say nicely that we are checking out, this guy just take the card, without looking at us and just keep quiet.We do nok know what to do, so we just walk offf...come'on, even if we are locals or you are very busy, your guest is to check out, would it pain to just turn your head to smile or say how's ur stay....Giving such an attitude really turns me off from this hotel, don't even ask me to recommend to my business clients...they will just have a bad impression on the hotels in Singapore...C'mon, there's a lot of bad reviews about the customer service at this hotel, the best that the management could do is to improve on this...", "Date": "March 8, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "2", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "London", "Title": "\u201cbudget rates, at the price of decent hospitality?\u201d", "Author": "LondonMadHatter", "ReviewID": "UR57956123", "Content": "This is one of TripAdvisor's highest rated hotel in Singapore (top 30) with the lowest budget, (less than SGD100) so I was convinced enough to give it a try. Let's talk about the good bits 1. Clean hotel (bed sheets and towels and toilets are hygienically taken cared of) Now for the not-so-good part I can live with... 1. Small room- fits a queen-size bed and some spaces just enough for one person to move along its perimeter. 2. Toilet the size of a closet - Once you shower everything gets wet. No cloth to wipe your feet so the tiny room gets wet as well. 3. Location - It's a good 20-30min walk to nearest MRT (Novena station), so if you know the bus route by heart and willing to fork out extra for taxis then no problemo. There isnt much in the surrounding area to keep you interested (IMHO). Now for the part i seriously have issues with- 1. THE HOTEL STAFFs IS JUST PLAIN RUDE! Now I have been traveling around the world for quite abit, stayed in alot of different hotels, met alot of people from different tradition/background along the way, and I'm not the fussy type who would complain bout cold food or split drink or even bad arrangements/mistakes- but this hotel is ran by a group of people who shows it up in your face that they are not happy and they don't give a damn what you think! From my experience- upon arrival the person behind the counter just ignore you doing his own things despite minutes of waiting until you interrupt him for his attention and he goes \"yes?\", no smiles, no apology, no welcoming words, no (any relatively similar form of) thank you as you leave the counter or check-out (even if you say thank you to them they just keep quiet)! it's as if they just had their pay cut announced in the morning and you happened to come in at the wrong time. What's best later is when we called front desk for an iron, the reception just said \"we're very busy at the moment and I'll get back to you when we're less busy\", upon asking when can we expect the delivery he then went \"just like I said, we're very busy and we'll get back to you later\" (I don't think I've ever heard the phrase \"just like i said\" from a hotel inquiry). This is not just for one particular person, but a few staff which I've interacted with. 2. THE SOUND PROOF IS NON EXISTENCE- to simply describe it, when the neighboring tenant closes their door/switches/shower, you'll honestly believe someone is in your room doing so (I had woken up a few times at night thinking someone have entered my room). not to imagine the occasional shout/scream/chatter other tenants made in their room and walking past the corridor. Bottom line is, we all know Singapore lacks affordable hotels to start with, but I for one does not agree cheaper rates comes in a price of bad treatment by worst-seen behaved hotel staffs (I won't say lack of training as smiling is a simple gesture of welcoming, free of charge!). I've seen alot of polite/friendly/helpful Singaporean right upon entry at the custom but this hotel certainly does not portray good Singaporean hospitality. If you can afford a few extra 10s I recommend trying your luck elsewhere, you wont miss much here. Otherwise, just note down the name of those rude staffs and hopefully the manager will be more polite to assist you (if not, i'm sure the Singapore tourism board may do :)", "Date": "March 7, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Auckland", "Title": "\u201cBest Budget Option in Thomson Area\u201d", "Author": "KiwiFromDownUnder", "ReviewID": "UR57842085", "Content": "Don't expect 5 star service from the Value Hotel Thomson, but this hotel is definitely one of the cleanest and cheapest hotesl I've stayed in Singapore.

Top tips for the Thomson: - Request a room away from the elevator lifts. People are constantly coming and going from this place, and my first night was awful being nearby. Have since moved room. - MRT is ten minutes walk (West). This is part of the Novena shopping complex, so you've got Starbucks, food halls, bookshop (level 2), all just a walk away. Buses are good, but not in rush hour when the motorways are jammed. - Pillows are rock hard: bring your own! Seriously. - Pack a pair of jandals (for the toilet). The toilet / shower is combined into about a one metre square box... and so you're basically standing on the toilet when showering. Yuk. Cheers and happy travelling.

We went to the Value Hotel Balesteir and the front office assistant was very friendly. He told us the hotel we reserved was Value Hotel Thomson and gave us a hotel map, showed us the way and suggested us to take a taxi with a smile on his face which is very professional. The smell of Value Thomson was very pleasant in the lobby. But to be perfect, there was a small issue. Upon Check-in the front office assistant who was a girl wasn't really friendly, or lets say professional. No smile nor explanations when key card was given.

Room facilities are very good with LCD screen having channels like HBO, TV2 and so many others. Hair dryer in the draw was even better than my own. tea making facilities, mugs, and internet cable in the drawer of the dressing table which is not free. There were no fridge. The toilet was very small. Toilet Tissue, Showering gel, showering cap, shampoo, toothbrush and toothpaste was provided. The central AC works quite well. The most important thing is you want to be careful because the bed moves easily that you might drop and forget some of your things under the bed. Housekeeping Bed was very comfortable. Sheets were very clean and well folded with standards during my stay. New coffee and milk tea was provided everyday during my stay. But it seems like housekeeping steward forgot to clean/flush the toilet the last day of our stay. The security is very good in the hotel during my stay.

There are a few minor points \u2013 the room is very small with the bed taking up most of the floor space. Therefore storage is limited to a few hangers in a very small wardrobe but there is a handy window ledge to store cases. As others have also noted the whole bathroom gets soaked when using the shower so expect constant wet feet. However, the room is very clean with a large LCD TV showing plenty of channels. The pool area is really nice with plenty of sun loungers. The location was fine once we got the hang of using the buses \u2013 on our first day we went on the open top bus tour (catch it near the tourist centre on Orchard Rd) which was great as it helped us to get our bearings. We were then confident to use the local buses as we knew landmarks / where we wanted to be. We preferred using the bus to taking the metro from Novena (about a 10 minute walk away) as you got to see things on your journey and it stops just outside the hotel on Balestier Rd. However if you walk round to the bus stops on Thomson Rd (two minute walk \u2013 near the traffic lights) there is a lot more choice of bus services which serve most destinations. We tried breakfast the first morning and it was ok but we prefer a (boring!) western breakfast of toast / croissants etc which were not provided. So the second morning we caught the bus to Novena (lazy \u2013 but once you get the hang of using the buses a $ to save the walk is appealing) where there was a great bakery serving lovely croissants and coffee. Taxi to/from the airport was less than $20.

By the time we had the money to book a hotel, most hotels are already fully booked bec. of the APEC summit, others are really expensive. So we just decided to book at Value Hotel Thomson. I'm very hesitant at first bec. of the size of the room and bathroom. I even emailed them to get the size of the rooms. I tried to book to a deluxe room which is a little bigger but unfortunately, it's also not available. I become more hesitant but since we're running out of time, we decided to book a superior room, and I'm glad we did! Right after we got off the taxi, one of the staff helped us removed our luggage from the taxi. We checked in 4 hrs earlier than the check in time but we didn't get any charge for it. We just paid the late check-out dues.10sgd /hr. Check in is smooth, it only took us around 10min. When we went to our room, I was surprised! It's not as small as I thought. I just found out they have 4 types of rooms - standard, superior,deluxe and triple. Maybe that's the reason why it's a little bigger. I told the staff before we go to our rooms to inform us if there'll be deluxe rooms available so we can upgrade. But when we saw the room, we decided not to. The room is just enough for us. We're not goin' to spend the whole day there anyway. The bathroom however is small but is tolerable. About the noise, you can hear it if your roommates if they're banging the doors of course. but during our stay, we didn't have any problems with that. They have a restaurant named 2nd kitchen and just like their website advertised, you can have a hearty buffet breakfast at SGD7/person. They have some variations everyday so that's good. The staff there are very friendly and helpful. One of them really took the effort to try to speak tagalog (philippine native language) and we're entertained. The hotel has a nice pool and a 2 gym facilities. There's free drinking water and coffee in the room and is being replenished everyday.

The MRT was only a few bus stops away from the hotel.", "Date": "October 29, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "3", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Gloucester", "Title": "\u201cThe best budget hotel in Singapore\u201d", "Author": "fishynomad", "ReviewID": "UR47306996", "Content": "I arrived in Changi Airport and took the MRT to Novena station (SGD2.80). At Novena station, head out towards Novena Square exit and turn right, walk up Thomson road for 10 minutes, and the Value Thomson Hotel is situated just behind Balestier Shopping Complex (opposite on Balestier Road). Check-in was a breeze, even though they said I only booked 1 night, but I actually booked 2 nights. The problem was sorted quickly and efficiently. My room was what I expected, a double bed with clean sheets and comfortable. Good air-conditioning control. Tea and coffee to hand with kettle and a good sized LCD flat screen. Only 4 English channels, (HBO, ESPN, Football channel, News channel). Also a hair-dryer. There is a built-in shelf that runs across the entire window, which you can put your luggage, with a wardrobe with 5 hangers. The bathroom (wet room) is a good size, sink, toilet, and hot shower. There is one problem (there always is for this price) the noise from the other room seems to travel through the above air-conditioning vent. My neighbours were quiet, so I was lucky. I didn't use the pool on level 7, so I have no comment. Just by the lifts is a internet section with 3 terminals, not sure whether they are free to use. There is a restuarant just outside which served western and local. Chinese restuarants are within walking distance all around the hotel.", "Date": "October 20, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Melbourne", "Title": "\u201cHas to be one of the better budget hotels in Singapore!\u201d", "Author": "ausooi", "ReviewID": "UR47269010", "Content": "Was only in Singapore for couple of nights and was looking for a budget place. Almost decided to book Fragrance agan until Sg friend recommended this one. So gave it a go. Totally agreed with one of the previous reviews - This hotel is much better than and Fragrance (and most likely Hotel 81). This place was much better in every sense. Newer, location-wise, bit more spacious, larger TV and quieter. The bathroom is still small (when shower, expect most things to get wet), but its larger than the other budget hotel that I stayed with before. Not much space if you have 2 (or more) large suitcases (ie. family) The location is also very good. Just outside the have lots of hawker food stalls (the restaurant food did look decent, but walk across the road is much cheaper local food stuff) , cheap net cafe nearby (SG$1 / hr - avoid using hotel net service if possible), and abut 150m walk to a bus-stop that will take you directly to heart of Orchard Road in about 10-15 mins bus-ride. No problems with the staffs. Hint: I requested for non-smoking and mid-rise room thanks to previous comments. It was quiet! But I sincerely believed a bit of luck sometimes. Overall, I highly recommend this place to singles (or couples) who are looking for a neat, compact, budget type place to live in Singapore! For family type it still ok, but will be cramped.

The location is superb for the price I paid (S$ 79),:2 bus stops away from a train station (Novena) or just 7 minutes by cab to Orchard Road. My only complaint is that the walls are thin - I could hear my neighbour's TV and people chatting outside very clearly; especially housekeeping.
