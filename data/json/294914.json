We have seen how the number of good hotels have increased and especially the number of new beautiful butique hotels in the Sultanahmet district. For our spring break this year we chose to stay in Sokullu Pasa Hotel on the recommandation of Turkish friends. From the moment we entered the front door it became a wonderful experience due to a very welcoming and friendly staff. The hotel has recently been upgraded and today it is exceptionally beautifully decorated in the Ottoman style. We wanted to make the stay something extra this time and had chosen one of the two suites, the \"Harem Suite\" In addition to a huge, comfortable bedroom with a round bed which could have belonged to a sultan, the suite had a beautiful bathroom with a jacuzzi, a seperate toilet, and a seperate shower. But the highlight of the suite was the private Turkish bath (Hammam) in grey marble with colourful Isnik tiles. The suite had now windows, but it did still have enough air and light as each of the rooms had several domes in the ceiling. We travelled with another couple, who chose the other suite : The Bosphorus suite. They were just as satisfied as we, as they in addition to a marvellous room also had a small balcony with an incredible view over the Bosphorus and the Marmara Sea. The Breakfast buffet was first class and was included in the rate of the room. Apart from the beauty of the hotel and the good service we must also point out the perfect location only 4 minutes walk away from the Blue Mosque . The hotel is situated in a small sidestreet without traffic noise in an area with small wooden houses. Some of these are now turned into hotels, but the majority of the houses are still used as family homes. It gave us a unique feeling of experiencing the real Istanbul in a way we have not had before in the Sultanahmed district. It is a hotel we really hope we will have the chance to return to in the near future.", "Date": "May 4, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Moscow, Russia", "Title": "\u201cOne of the best hotels of Istanbul\u201d", "Author": "Valery112", "ReviewID": "UR102733269", "Content": "The hotel is very nice.

Sokulla Pasa is a short walk from some of the major historic sites. The blue mosque, St. Sofia, Egyptian Spice bazaare and lots of shops, cafes and restaurants. More importantly are the wonderful people that have worked hard to make the Sokulla Pasa feel like a home away from home. The staff were warm, welcoming and went out of their way to assist in anything that I needed. They provided helpful information and took the time to answer any questions I had over a hot cup of tea and Turkish cookies :) The buffet was simple and fresh, with great service. Although the space was bit ackward in the bathroom with the positioning of the door and toilet, the room was a nice size for one person. The restaurant, located in the basement looked out into a nice garden through a wall of windows, accompanied with original brick walls from the Ottoman Empire.
