However, I added the extra dot because they have a shuttle that basically takes you anywhere within a 3 mile radius of the hotel, which is wonderful! You just let them know what time you need it and they provide it. The location was perfect for us as we were visiting family, but for those who want to shop, the Dadeland Mall is across the road and many other shops and restaurants very close by. Check in and check out is incredibly slow as they only seem to have 1 person on duty most of the time and that one person seems to have to answer the phone, deal with guests and do everything. The rooms are clean and comfortable - free wifi throughout the hotel which is a definite bonus. Bathrooms are basic but clean. Shower just a trickle of water that takes a long time to warm up but to be honest, for the price we paid, we didn't have great expectations. Breakfast was very pleasant and totally adequate for our needs. One word of warning, however....we had a prepaid voucher for our stay that included breakfast. When we had breakfast on the first morning, we were billed for it. On querying this with reception, we apparently should have been given breakfast vouchers . This breakfast appeared on the bill at the end of our stay. They did refund it immediately, but to save the hassle, make sure you get your breakfast vouchers when you check in as you do need them to get your free breakfast. All in all a very pleasant stay, and at such good value, we would stay there again.", "Date": "March 21, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Cleveland, Ohio", "Title": "\u201cExcellent Stay in Miami area\u201d", "Author": "Scottson", "ReviewID": "UR125990924", "Content": "The Hotel Indigo was a welcome change.

Next day, after having specifically requested the room to be made and sheets/towels to be changed (because we were in and out of the room and had wanted it done while we were gone), we came back to the room to find the same pillow case with the stain on the bed. I then lifted up the comforter and found hair still on the sheet. We called the front desk (Chris) and complained. Because it was late at night, he was the only staff on duty, besides security, he offered to let us have another room. We went up to check the cleanliness of the new room, with the security, and found the same exact problem. The sheet in the new room had hair and stain on it as well; they were never changed from the last occupancy. We then went back down, and that's when Chris told us that we were the 3rd complaint of the night. Other people noticed the dirty sheets/rooms as well! Because it was so late at night, we compromised by accepting fresh sheets from the dryer from Chris (and made the bed ourselves) and he comped the night, promising us the manager (Rick) will call us the next day.

The room was a bit small and while it was nice to have a couch/sitting area and a desk the room would have been less cramped without it. It was an old hotel that was recently updated so there were some things in the room that were characteristic of an old motel, but nothing was in really bad shape, just slightly outdated. The staff was GREAT! I even got a jump from one of the staff members when on the last day of our stay I had a dead car battery. I thought they would say to call AAA but NOPE, they were more than happy to help. My only complaint was the lack of a refrigerator (which for me is big since I am on a restricted diet) which I requested prior to check in and was not in the room when we got there to check in late at night. When I requested it the next morning they did not have any left. Luckily we brought a cooler and the ice machines were kept fully stocked.

The location seemed really good, easily accessible, parking close to the building, near shops\\restaurants, and the decor is modern. It's a pretty small hotel and did seem like it was remodeled from an older place. At night around Christmastime with the lights on the palm trees surrounding the place it looked really cool too. The front desk staff was really outgoing and helpful and so was the bar\\restaurant attendant. And we were given vouchers for free breakfast in the lobby restaurant, which was small but had* excellent* food. All of this made a pretty good impression on me at first. But unfortunately, the property had some basic problems which ruined it for me as a business traveler, and probably were due to the fact that renovated or not, the building was older. The windows and walls of the place are incredibly thin. Every bit of traffic noise from the outside could be heard, and at 3:30AM while I was trying to rest up for my business meetings the next day I was awoken by the clearly heard and loud sounds of an amorous couple next door, and similarly had been kept away the night before until 10:30-11 by the room on the other side - just playing their clock radio loudly. The wireless internet was so slow as to be almost unusable, and had I not had a backup broadband LTE card to connect through, I would have been unable to work in the room. So for those reasons alone, I don't recommend it highly. I'd also mention that parts of the room itself were in poor condition, some of the trim, and the fake wood floor planks actually had large gaps (1/4\"+) between ends\\edges of the planks, really poor.. TV/Cable older, not great pic quality. There is no tub in the room, only a shower if that's a concern.

We were going to leave the pets at my sister's house while we retired to the hotel so I booked the Holiday Inn. Well, in families things change and we were stuck at the last minute - after checking in and putting our bags in the Holiday Inn - and my sister didn't want the pets at her house without us around. As a last resort (I was going to break the rules and chance a $250 pet fee at the H.I.), I called the Indigo and asked if they had a room available - the lady was going to fix the whole situation on the phone and transfer us if I had not already checked in. Instead I called the H.I. and the manager Manuel Castillo was AWESOME and allowed us to break that reservation penalty free because I promised to book the same room nights at the Indigo while standing in front of him. HUGE relief to solve this mini-crisis. The Indigo was very accommodating to pets and us and the room was just great.

The shuttle service is nice, but expect to wait if you need it. Due to the busy location, it isn't always on time.

The other thing that was irritating was that they were supposed to bill my contract house for the stay, but billed me instead. When my manager called, they told him they billed him and only had my credit card for incidentals. However, he didn't have any charges for me so he and I just worked it out on our own.

I researched many hotels in the area. Hotel Indigo was a bit more expensive, but it offered a free shuttle within 3 mi of the Hotel. It was near a mall, and shopping directly across the street so this seemed a good fit for visiting without a car. I traveled with my daughter and we had a King size bed and sleeper sofa. We found the front desk workers to be very polite and attempted to be as helpful as possible! We found the room very clean. The air conditioner worked well, though the first night we did not know how to adjust it (we arrived late at night) It was quite noisy, but after a while we didn't notice it. There is free wifi in the room and a nice TV. We found the bar/restaraunt to be very small and there was no room service menu in the room. I had to go down 5 floors to get a menu to order room service. But the food was hot and very good, the night we needed to eat in. It was very convenient to be able to walk across the street to a real Starbucks (the Starbucks in the Hotel is not really a Starbucks). There is also a very wonderful Bakery across the street. It has lovely international and tropical sweet pastries, savory pastries, desserts, sandwiches, and breads! There were a couple of hitches. Though I made arrangements ahead of time at the front desk every time we needed the shuttle, there always seemed to be some mix up. One time I almost missed my doctors appointment and the driver seemed very irritated with us. Another time, he completely missed the resteraunt (even though we saw it and gave him the address) and it ended up taking an extra half hour because of turning around and traffic. So, my advice is to be really pushy about the shuttle. Well... very clear over and over... clear to the front desk with time and address... then confirm with the driver as you get on the shuttle, then speak up if he's going the wrong way!!! The pool was small but nice - though the chair only allows one to lay on their back in the sun and do not adjust.. Towels are provided in each chair. Coming from the NW, I wanted some sun so I laid on the pavement. Also, most of the pool area was shaded this time of year and I had about a 1 1/2 hr space that I could catch sun. This is not a complaint - only an observation and something for others to know. The bed was not very comfortable - we both had backaches, BUT the pillows were GREAT! Also, the towels were fabulous - thick and absorbent and smelled clean. The toiletries were very very nice and high quality. My only other complaint, is that the Hotel didn't have very good instructions or information in the rooms. There was a flip card with basic info, but no tourist info, and many things in our room we had to figure out ourselves. I like Hotels that have nice books with lots of information in them - restaraunts - shopping - hotel policies - how to work things in the room, etc etc. All and all I was very happy with my choice. It was the perfect location for what I needed and though right next to the Hwy - it was nice and quiet, peaceful and clean. And if I have to go back, I will choose this Hotel again. I hope this helps others planning a trip to the Dadeland/Kendall area of Miami.", "Date": "February 12, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Venice, Florida", "Title": "\u201cA Nice Place to Stay for a Business or Leisure Trip\u201d", "Author": "jeretired", "ReviewID": "UR95618912", "Content": "This was our first time at a \"boutique\" Hotel, no carpeting on the floor, hardwood throughout.

I travelled from the Turks and Caicos Islands for breast cancer treatment, doctors' appointments, tests and more tests, surgery and radiation too. My main consideration when searching for a hotel to stay at was of course proximity to the South Miami Hospital since my stays were from ten days to over two weeks at a time. I loved the looks of the rooms and of course the shuttle was key in my decision making. I booked a room with two beds because every step of the way, I had family from Canada fly down to be with me so I wouldn't be alone. The staff was friendly, courteous and always ready with a smile and a hello. The small restaurant on site was a real bonus for those days when I was too exhausted to go out and have a bite to eat. I loved the French onion soup! House keeping was generally pretty good although on one trip, our bathroom was in need of a bit of work and then also sometimes we didn't get clean glasses. Nothing too dramatic though. We had a few glitches with the shuttle...........a couple of long waits for pick ups ( I guess they forgot us) even after we made sure we called at about 10 to the hour. The shuttle would leave promptly on the hour though which was good for making sure I made my appointments in plenty of time. The drivers were great but one was overly talkative and another spoke pretty much no English. On my second trip, I found out that small fridges were available ........ this really helped as I was in the hotel for a two and a half weeks stay. It made it more convenient to put in a few items and not have to head out to find something to eat all the time. My one big disappointment with the Hotel Indigo was NO BATHTUB.............yes, I know all about water conservation coming from the Turks where we have an annual rainfall of 2 feet! I spoke to Rick, the manager and asked him to relay my suggestion to the hotel powers that be. The hotel has many guests that are in Miami for health issues and treatments and I suggested that they could perhaps make over a few rooms and put the bathtubs back in. I had bi lateral lumpectomies so a bath tub would have made things easier for me after the surgery. My last week at the hotel included radiation. I had a balloon catheter inserted into the cavity where the tumor had been removed. This was filled with saline water and I went twice a day for five days of radiation treatments. So for a week, I was not allowed to get anything wet and NO showers. With all this stress of breast cancer going on in my life, a bath tub and a long soak with a good book would have been a way to relax and forget things for a short while. Oh yes..........the shopping. It doesn't get any better or more convenient than this. The shuttle took us everywhere. Dadeland Mall, Sunset Mall, The Falls, Target, K Mart and Publix etc. Thanks everyone..........I do hope I don't have to return in the future but if I do, I'll be staying with you!

First the buliding looks like it use to be like a Holiday Inn Express so your thoughts coming to the bldg may not be postive but dont be fooled. The decor in the lobby is up to date and the cafe is a nice place for a snack. (Just an fyi the cafe doubles as the restaurant). My room was a handicapped room but was very spacious. I was disappointed about the smell in the bathroom.. It did have a slight smell but i didnt complain because it was a handicapped room. The pictures online are exactly what the room looks like but with more space! The bed was sooooo comfy, I actually thinking about purchasing a bed just like it. I didnt hear any neighbors during my stay there. Now if your planning on being in South Beach a lot, just note the hotel is about a 25 min drive away from Miami Beach. When traveling to the hotel note to take 836 (dolphin hwy) South to get the hotel and take the 88th street exit. And you will be right next to the hotel. The area was great too! There was a wonderful mall down the street from the hotel. They have a Macys and Saks Fifth Ave. with other luxury stores inside..

I chose Hotel Indigo for its location and reasonable rates (I booked flight and hotel combo thru Travelocity). I have many kudos for this hotel. First off, the staff from the front desk to the restaurant to housekeeping to maintenance/shuttle drivers were friendly and eager to help me - at all times. I used the hotel's shuttle quite a bit as I needed on almost a daily basis to go to an address 2 1/2 miles away, and the hotel offers free shuttle service to a maximum distance of 3 miles. One time the hotel's phone system was down, and I had the manager's, Rick, card with his cell phone number on it so I called him to tell him I needed the shuttle to pick me up. I was apologetic that I intruded that way but Rick was very, very pleasant, told me he would have the shuttle come get me right away and even called me when the shuttle was on its way. Which is another reason I liked Hotel Indigo. It is a manageable size so you get personal service and attention to detail. It truly was like a home away from home during my stay. The rooms are clean enough with comfy beds, the breakfasts were tasty, the exercise room is adequate. The hotel is also close to plenty of good restaurants. Although my first impressions of the hotel were more along the lines of this hotel will be adequate, I grew to love this place.

Floors are hard surface (wood laminate) and area rugs or throw rugs. Lamps and furnishings are very contemporary- and very comfortable. I had a fridge in my unit. The rooms were very clean, AC worked great. Colors are very unusual as well as artwork and wall murals. There is a small restaurant in the lobby, but I did not eat there.
