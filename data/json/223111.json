Instead, Raquel said she'd be glad to let us have a room early, if there was any available. I didn't even have to ask! I have to say, her personality made our stay even more pleasant! I didn't even tell her it was my birthday and she wrote a warm birthday wish on a little card. She also gave us great advice on where to eat and gave great directions. Not only was the service great and the rooms nice, we also loved the location of the hotel. The hotel is located just outside the French Quarter, so it's not too rowdy. It's walking distance to everything, right around the corner from Acme Restaurant, walking distance to Harrahs, great shops and the ferry.

The descriptions online of the hotel give it way more justice than it deserves and arriving at the front door of the hotel (which is in a watery, stinky alley way) was a little worrysome. We were \"greeted\" by the front office staff to check in and were told that we needed to put down a deposit of over 100.00 never mentioned anywhere else or to my Mother BEFORE we could check in> I didn't understand but we were tired and wanted into our room so we agreed on a tight budget and gave the $$ over. The staff is definately NOT friendly in any way and unfortunately I got the distinct impression it was a racial issue over the course of our stay. Our room was acceptable and we quickly learned the attached hotel had a much friendlier staff and nicer entrance so we used that to come and go-bellhops were awesome! It is a fabulous location and despite the staff we had a great time. I do have to say that there was one gal in particular that brought us room service our first night who was really nice and told us some great places to check out and also gave us a ton of safety tips and we really enjoyed her the 5 minutes she was in our room! We ordered room servcie one night and the guy who delivered it didn't know how to deal with a credit card order. He hand wrote my card number down and didn't give me a reciept but said everything would be taken care of. At checkout time we were told we owed money for that same room service order and that they had no record of me ever giving a credit card number and said it had been \"charged\" to my room. It took over an hour to resolve the situation with me raising my voice and asking where the employee was with my credit card number in hand! An employee from the kitchen remembered the situation and brought about friendly resolve but I can definately say that if we ever return to NO we will definately find somewhere else to stay.", "Date": "April 17, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Service": "2", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "New York City, New York", "Title": "\u201cIt served the purpose.

This hotel is really the bare bones sister of the adjoining hotel, the Astor. WHen we arrived, Wednesday evening, there were 2 clerks at the desk discussing their dinner orders. They were pleasant, but spent more time talking to each other than taking care of our checking in. There was no bellhop to speak of, but we didn't have a problem with that. Our room was on the 4th fl. facing Canal St. It was on the dark side, but I don't think as dark as those facing the inner courtyard. The room was a decent size (we had 2 queen beds for a family of 4). There were definitely signs of wear and tear, but there was also an attempt at charm and it was clean. Overall it was nicer than a Holiday Inn, but not as nice as a Marriott. We did have a problem with the TV remote and one of the phones. We also requested extra pillows. They did respond rather quickly to these situations. There was one day when I put out the 'Maid Service Please' sign when we left in the morning, when we returned at 3:30, the room still wasn't cleaned. We called and also told the front desk as we went out again. They finally did come and clean at that point. The location can't be beat, and it was quiet at night. The Bourbon House restaurant, located in the adjoining Astor hotel was very nice for dinner, but a disappointment for breakfast (walk the 2 blocks to the Marriott for a great breakfast buffet). We had no problem getting a late checkout (actually not all that late, 1pm, but better than 11), they also arranged for a taxi back to the airport, and held our luggage for a few hours after we did check out. We didn't have a problem with dark scarey corridors when we came and went through the Astor lobby. If you get a good deal, and are looking for a place that 'serves the purpose', the ALexa is fine.

We checked in on the Astor Crowne Plaza side and stayed on the Alexa side. We were able to pull right in front of the hotel on Canal Street to drop off the car with the valet and get assistance with our bags. The Astor front desk had no problem checking us in there, and the bellman led us to our room on the Alexa side. Our room was directly over Royal Street on the third floor. The bellman called the Alexa \"the quiet side.\" They assigned us to a handicapped-accessible room, which was much larger than a standard room. (We had friends staying in the Alexa as well and their room was smaller/narrower but still very nice). Our room had a huge window overlooking Royal Street, which was interesting. The room was clean and nice, although basic. We had plenty of toiletries and towels. We found all of the staff to be very helpful. There were three entrances/exits -- on Canal, on Bourbon (through the restaurant) and on Royal through the Alexa lobby. Our room was right by the elevator down to the Alexa lobby (which I worried about at first but was not a problem and actually nicely convenient). I did find it a little odd to travel through a maze of corridors and elevators to get from one side of the hotel to the other, to use the gym, pool or visit the restaurant, but it was not a big deal. The only potential problem involves the valet parking, which is located off-site from the hotel. If you need your car during your stay, you have to take a hotel shuttle to the parking deck, which is located several blocks away. We did not need to do this, as we prefer to take a cab if we're going far afield, but it could be time-consuming and inconvenient. Also, upon checkout, you do have to load your luggage onto the shuttle (with the help of a bellman -- and tip him) then tip the shuttle driver, then have another bellman unload the luggage again and load it in the car, another tip! Plus the wait for the shuttle to get there, everyone to load up that needs a ride to their car, etc. I'd suggest checking out at the last minute or off-peak time. We were told check-out could take up to 45 minutes due to waiting on the shuttle, but we didn't have any trouble since we checked out right at noon and left the hotel around 12:15.", "Date": "November 3, 2004"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "4.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Unknown", "Title": "\u201cLoved the location\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR2802440", "Content": "I read some pretty bad reviews about this hotel and I thought it was pretty decent.

Traveled with another party staying at the Crown Plaza next door. We had a much lower price then they had in their hotel, with similar rooms and being able to use the same facilities. Very convenient being able to exit the hotel on any of the three streets, exited on Royal when getting breakfast or going shopping, exited on Canal when going uptown, and exited on Bourbon when going out for the evening. The room our companions had in the Plaza was slightly larger, but ours had beautiful 12 foot ceilings and massive windows overlooking Canal. We had only two minor complaints about the whole trip. The first is that upon arrival, there were no rooms available as we had requested. We were early for check in anyway, so we left our bags with the front desk, and got lunch. The second complaint is that it is kind of a maze to get from one hotel to the other. If we were to visit our companions in the ajoining hotel, we had to walk down a half flight of stairs, take the elevator down, walk through the Crown Plaza's lobby, and finally ride their elevator up to their floor. I cannot comment on the helpfulness of the staff, as we were all experienced with travel to New Orleans, and two of us had lived there in the past.
