So it came as quite a shock when I walked through the front door of this establishment. The reception and common parts looked grotty and smelled uninviting. Peeling paintwork, tatty carpet tiles, exposed wires and piping should have warned me off there and then. But as my partner and I didn't arrive until after 10pm and without a car, there was no choice but to check in. Still, as long as the room was reasonable and we could get a good night's rest, we wouldn't care. Oh dear, oh dear! Well too start with the so called \"family\" room we booked smelled of cigarettes. Sorry, not smelled but reeked would be more accurate. It was redolent a 1970's boozer. Needless to say everything else was shabby. Sorry, not shabby but grubby, stained, flakey, cracked, mouldy, threadbare and broken. Although I generally don't bother to complain, the thought of having to stay in such a room, even for one night, sent me to see the man on reception to ask for a change of rooms. He explained that there were no rooms left and my room didn't smell of cigarettes, the musty smell(as he described it) merely being due to the room's age. He did however, offer me the use of a can of air freshener, kept conveniently to hand on the counter, as compensation. I declined his offer, having already sprayed a liberal amount of perfume to no avail. Resigned, I went back to my room. Other points to note were being unable to obtain change for the vending machine. We had to dial in a food delivery, just so we could get something to drink. The hotel not being situated near any conveniences precluded travelling anywhere on foot. Very thin walls and floors at least let you know you weren't suffering alone. Couldn't take a bath or shower, just too dirty. Television broken, obviously. And the stained duvet and mattress didn't really help any already unlikely attempts of romance with my partner.

The website told me I had the last room but a friend booked online on the day before the funeral and got a room without any problems. The motel description advised that there was quite limited parking. In fact, the hotel and the Harvester next door occupy a large plot and share a large car park, so parking was not a problem. The decor in the hotel and carpets etc were rather tired and needed a \"makeover\". However, our non-smoking double room was clean and comfortable and everything worked. Although there was a Harvester pub next door, it was not part of the motel and so the only breakfast available at the motel was a prepackaged continental offering at around \u00c2\u00a35. For what we paid, I felt that the accommodation was expensive. Unlike another motel chain you have to pay up front in full. There is an optional cancellation policy that you can purchase for \u00c2\u00a31. However, based on experiences with another Travelodge booking which I had to cancel, it is very difficult to get your money back. Would I stay at this motel again? Only if I could get a cheap rate deal.", "Date": "December 22, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "2", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "1", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Birmingham, England", "Title": "\u201cNeeds some tlc\u201d", "Author": "fastsophie", "ReviewID": "UR22803888", "Content": "We didn't book until a couple of days before our stay (maybe all the best rooms were gone?)

On the plus side - the bed was comfortable, sheets were pristine clean, the room was a fair size. The staff were very pleasant and helpful. On the down side - the bathroom needs a deep clean or redecorating, looked yuk! Glad we were only there one night and could get home to our nice clean bathroom the next morning. There were dirty marks on the wall in the bedroom which looked like they could have been cleaned off. The curtains looked tatty. The aroma in the room wasn't pleasant - we wonder if this was a smoking room that had not been deep cleaned since the smoking ban was introduced? Really wished we had booked at the Holiday Inn - it was a little further away from the party we were going too, and a few quid more, but on reflection I'm sure it would have been nicer. On the whole it did the job we needed it to, a comfortable bed for one night to save us driving home from a party, but wouldn't stay there again, and as this was our first experience of Travelodge we would think twice about using them in the future.", "Date": "December 17, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "2", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "London", "Title": "\u201cBargain Accommodation on a budget!\u201d", "Author": "HelenJayne", "ReviewID": "UR21995037", "Content": "As the old saying goes \" You get what you pay for!\" Paying just \u00c2\u00a345.00 for a hotel room on the outskirts of South West London during the Summer holidays - I didn't expect a 5* experience. I did expect decent, clean, standard accommodation with no frills but basic needs which is exactly what we got!! Whilst on holiday at my friends in Cornwall, we had planned a trip to an England footy match at Wembley as a treat for her son and two friends. All we needed was an over night place to rest our heads, somewhere the kids (12 and 18) would be comfortable and somewhere not too costly. The Travel Lodge fitted the bill! Driving the 4 hour trip from Bude, you want to ensure that there is ample parking so that the car is practically in reception. Ample indeed the parking facitlities are! Even in the height of the Summer hols the car was parked in seconds a couple of metres from the front door. Simple check in - bog standard reception area, bored looking staff but quick and easy. The rooms all on one level were situated nearby - the boys to the rear of the hotel overlooking Morden Park, us to the front overlooking the car park! All you would expect from a budget hotel; decent size rooms, standard bathroom with shower over bath, double/twin beds with very thin but 'can cope with' mattress and duvet, basic tea and coffee making facilities and TV with terrestrial channels. Generally a down to earth, basic almost Butlns style type of accommodation where you don't worry if the kids decide to use the bed as a trampoline for half hour or so!! We knew the area well having lived in the region for over 20 years - but if you don't then please don't be fooled by the name Travel Lodge Morden/WIMBLEDON! Wimbledon is in fact a good 15 - 20 minute drive in traffic and atleast a 45 minute walk even through the back roads. If you are coming to Wimbledon for the tennis or theatre - try Wimbledon town centre hotels such as the Phoenix or Antionette. You'll be sadly disappointed if you book in here and expect to be on the doorstep of SW19. Like many Travel Lodges, the Morden/Wimbledon hotel is in an 'out of town' location . Morden town centre is accessible by many buses along the main high road but is still a fair walk of 15-20 mins and has limited parking in the town centre if you are thinking of taking the car! On a high point - although booked on a room only basis, the hotel is directly opposite a very good Harvester restaurant should you feel the need for a hearty meal. The early bird menu offered great value for money traditional English /American dinner which the kids devoured. All in all a bog standard package. Generally very good value for money on a cheap budget but if the room rate exceeds 60 quid think about trying elsewhere.", "Date": "November 19, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "3", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "3", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cOK place\u201d", "Author": "thebride57", "ReviewID": "UR13701782", "Content": "Not a bad place.

Confirmation had right hotel but address for Travelodge Wellingborough. This took days to sort out but problem was with American based Travel-now as opposed to Travelodge who kindly thanked me for pointing out the fault. We went midweek for 2 nights as a base for Wimbledon. Staff were young but friendly enough. As the tennis was on we were charged \u00c2\u00a380 per night which had jumped up from the \u00c2\u00a346 quoted, albeit we were told this was the correct rate for Wellingborough. Think we were told we would be \u00c2\u00a379 and noted that room rate was'nt advertised in reception. The room had the basics but was in need of a clean, my wife having found half a tin of Vaseline which had been left under the bed. There was a light missing its cover and some dents in the walls. The bed linen was clean enough and bed was comfortable. As it was one of the warmest days of the year, air conditioning would have been nice and we slept on top of the covers. The shower was tempremental running hot and cold and the tap sprayed the water about. There was also a hole in the bathroom floor.
