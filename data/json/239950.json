Easy access to interstate and great little restaurant right down the road, The Kettle which I will review under the restaurants. Did not eat the motel free breakfast, as we slept in each morning. The only drawback was parking. When we ret'd to our room New Year's Morning about 1:00 am, all the parking in the back was full. Even though our room was in the back, we had to park out front and walk around the building. I am not sure if they have parking spots for every room they rent. Did not appear so during our stay. We had a smoking room and it smelled so fresh, I was pleasantly surprised.

A quick call on the courtesy phone at the airport brought the shuttle within 10 minutes. A quick drive back to the hotel, and we were able to check in and get to our rooms. At check-in, there was no recognition of the guest's elite status in the BW rewards program, no offer of a room upgrade, no gift bag, no bonus points. A bit unfortunate. The room was large and comfortably arranged. A small sitting area, work desk, very comfortable king bed, enclosed bath/toilet, sink, and a closet. Flat screen TV. Ample lighting. The room looked like it had been recently renovated. Everything was clean and tidy. The shower head is definitely not a water saver model - gallons and gallons of hot water were available at high pressure. Towels were adequate, but could have been a bit larger. The internet connection worked well, albeit slowly. There is a jack for an Ethernet connection, but no cable provided, so I couldn't check if it worked. Breakfast had decent choices, including waffles, yogurt, biscuits, grits, cereal, fresh fruit, various breads, juices, coffee. Overall, very good. On departure, we were offered a shuttle ride to a place nearby, off-airport, without any problems; this was convenient and appreciated. I'd certainly recommend this hotel for a future stay in Memphis near the airport, or for a visit to Graceland.", "Date": "December 8, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Dayton, Ohio", "Title": "\u201cbest western executive inn memphis\u201d", "Author": "debbyt1051", "ReviewID": "UR120507748", "Content": "Just okay.

There is nothing within walking distance for eating or shopping. The drive to Graceland is through a neighborhood of pawn shops, gas station mini-marts and boarded-up buildings.

Elvis Presley Blvd has nothing but fast-food drive-thru's; no sit-down-and-be-served restaurants such as an Applebee's, Chili's, Denny's or Outback.

The neighborhood may not be all bright and secure looking but we have never felt threatened here. The employees reminded us not to leave valuables in sight in our car - well no matter where you are that should be a rule. There seems to be families working there and all were friendly. They were always able to offer suggestions or keep us posted on news we needed. We just left the do not disturb sign up cause we were content with just fresh towels and tissue as needed. They were always happy to swap out towels for us when we saw them on our floor. We often saw someone walking around the building or lot doing their own security. The room is large. We had two queen beds, and a sofa area. Three or Four ladies and all their needs, bling and snacks for 3-4 days and we have never felt cramped. A couple of our folks smoked and the hotel was quick to supply a stand up ashtray outside the door for them. To be able to make this trip we need to make it an affordable trip and this hotel helps.

One of my traveling companions said it was the best shower he'd had in years.

I didn't use the fitness center but it looked very nice -- bike, treadmill, elliptical, and a few free weights. Staff was very friendly, particularly the guy setting out the breakfast. He also seemed very hygiene conscious which I really appreciated. My only real complaint was there were very few vending options on site. I wanted a bottle of water, but the lone drink machine was empty. There was one rather lame snack machine, too. However, there is a huge Exxon gas station/market about a block away that's open 24 hours a day during the week (closes at 10 Fri/Sat), so I should have just gone down there.

Cute little breakfast nook (although I hate breakfast and didn't try it, it looked decent...cereal, juice, milk, and fruit at the least). Desk clerks weren't Ritz-Carlton caliber obviously :) but were nice and not rude. The rooms were SURPRISINGLY nice. Extremely large for the price (mine looked like a mini-suite!) with a small sofa, desk, large TV in an armoire, a large mini-fridge, microwave, iron and ironing board (hair dryer too I believe), and a king bed! I paid $69 but could have easily paid $55 through the BW site had I booked earlier. Interior looked brand new...nice wallpaper and borders, a cute floral arrangement on the armoire, all in all it felt very much steps above a standard room. Such a nice, big room. I have stayed in much worse rooms for twice that price. There is a roomy sink/dressing area (including a rather large closet with a door!) with granite sinktop. The bathroom looked a little shabby (in comparison) with some cracked tile, worn looking walls in the shower, old looking faucets, etc, but in comparison to the rest of the room it really didn't matter. Water pressure in the shower was fabulous...when I arrived LATE Friday night I took a very, very long shower and had hot water like crazy...however, come Sunday check out, very little was left. I suspect this is one of those motels that runs out of hot water early in the day. I waited fifteen minutes and got back in to tepid water..it never did get hot again, but it wasn't unbearable, either. I have generally bad luck with hot water in hotels though so it may just have been me! I don't want to take a \"brief\" shower unless I am running mortally late and resent it when hot water is just about zapped after ten minutes! Beds were okay...not incredibly comfortable but not the Conestoga-wagon style beds made out of concrete I stayed in the next night at a Country Hearth Inn! Pillows weren't exceptionally thick either but weren't the dreaded toilet-paper thin wafers that some places dish out. Nothing stood out as exceptionally uncomfortable. The truly exceptional thing I encountered here was the leniency with check out. I was allowed to check out at 1 pm without any hassles. We got another call at around 12:30 where we reconfirmed the night manager OK'ed it and that was that. When I have had so many hassles with rudeness and absolutely unbendable rules with check outs, this was truly a treat. Kudos to the staff for not being rude or inflexible about this. The room would have been very quiet and peaceful had it not been for the rude guests that showed up Friday night. An SUV stood parked outside the pool with one of the loudest car audio systems I've ever heard (in any other context, I'd be impressed!) and at 2 am had the bass cranked so loud that my own bed was vibrating slightly despite being on the other side of the hotel from it. It sounded like one of the upstairs rooms was having a big party since I heard some bass, people shouting/stomping around, and so on for a little while. I wasn't in a hurry to sleep but I don't know how it didn't wake up others around me...after a good half hour, it quit; not sure if it was the hotel staff that said something or they just stopped themselves. This isn't the hotel's fault- it's the fault of the rude guests. Otherwise the rooms seemed pretty soundtight..I wouldn't suggest staying near the ice machine though, because I heard that grinding away all day and night, LOL. I was a woman traveling alone for the first night so I was paying close attention to my safety. There were plenty of cameras and the parking lot was well-lit; I didn't feel like I was in the best of neighborhoods but I have been in much worse! Very very close to the airport and the venue I was in town for (Mid-South Coliseum). Downtown was another quick drive, and Graceland is literally one exit down. It seems like a good central location if you're renting a car and flying in and out. I found the Wolfchase Galleria about twenty minutes away with every retail store, Macy's-type, and food outlet you could possibly want. (This area seemed VERY nice...Germantown..seemed like a bit more upscale area to stay in if you are looking for that) All in all, a very nice experience. I have had so many more hassles and disappointments with hotels three times the price of this one. Such large rooms that definitely feel more expensive than they are.
