The hotel is not a luxurious hotel but was nice and clean and the staff at the front desk were really helpful and friendly on a couple of occassions. It's location is good, you might need to get a bus to get to the waterbus stop but the bus stop is literally 1 min away and there is a very regular service...maybe we were lucky but I dont think we waited more than 5 minutes for a bus going to or from the hotel. Taxi from the waterbus stop cost us 10 euros which maybe advised when you have luggage as the busses can be quite crammed plus Venice in general is expensive so on the whole that 10 Euros seemed good value but without luggage the busses are great plus on Lido there only seems to be one or two main roads so once you have found your bearings it would be hard to get too lost (something I usually do on holidays) but the hotel was stop 7/12 I think or just after a garage and at the roundabout. Back to the hotel... the rooms were actually quite big, and I slept soundly each night so the bed was fine (or else I was worn out from endlessly walking around Venice); there is no fridge but we were told the tap water was fine to drink so that was fine and we got some bottles of water from the supermarket. Think the hotel sell bottles at a reasonable price. We did spend a couple of hours at the 'private beach' which cost us 20 euros for two deck chairs and an umbrella. Not sure if guests are allowed the sun loungers or if they cost more but when the missus tried to use an empty sun lounger this seemed to upset a couple of Italian old ladies who grassed us up to the beach attendant. When he arrived I asked if we could have a lounger instead of one deck chair and he said something about checking at the office and then he never came back. Not really a beach person myself and seeing as the beach on Lido lacks topless women and has a propensity for Italian men in Speedos it wasnt that exciting for me - for the gf dont think she liked sunbathing on a deck chair so we didnt really stay at the beach more than an hour. Think the beach is the only thing I can find fault with the hotel for. For Venice it is a reasonably priced hotel and to be honest its location on Lido gets you out of the total hustle and bustle that is the tourist rammed Venice. Lido itself is pretty and has some nice coffee shops, bars and some places to eat which are a bit cheaper than on the main Venice bit plus there is a supermarket which is useful to stock up on bits from - water at the supermarket for a big bottle cost us about 30 cents - near the main square when I was dehydrating I paid 3 euros for a bottle the same size! The breakfast was fine - Only bothered with it once but had a cup of coffee and chocolate croissant thingy which set me up for the day of endless walking in circles but seemed to have cereals and other stuff - not really a brekkie person but it seemed adequate. It is not a luxury hotel but it doesnt claim to be but it is a really nice no frills base for a short stay in Venice and I would definitely recommend it.", "Date": "August 30, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Frankfurt, Germany", "Title": "\u201cClean and friendly -- some difficulties\u201d", "Author": "KirstenDierolf", "ReviewID": "UR116293807", "Content": "We stayed at hotel Sorriso and rented 3 rooms for our family. They were all simple, clean and functioning. Putting up a third bed for our smallest child was not a problem at all. The hotel staff was friendly and helpful. Be aware that the hotel does not have a beach and that the public beach is 20 minutes walk (at least) away. The beaches next to the hotel are private and you have to rent a beach chair for 30 Euros a day. The water-bus / valporetto landing place is also quite far away. You have to take a bus to get there (which is easy and runs every 10 min). The airconditioning did not work very well in all three rooms and the breakfast was really really bad (instant coffee, no tea, bread that was reheated and not enough food for everyone). Best grab a croissant (if you can get one) and have an espresso at a cafe.", "Date": "August 5, 2011"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Hotel Sorriso", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g187870-d669926-Reviews-Hotel_Sorriso-Venice_Veneto.html", "Price": "$92 - $171*", "Address": "<div class=\"amenFloat\">", "HotelID": "669926", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/ProviderThumbnails/dirs/cc/f1/ccf1537a84bfdfd182bb5f4064d83fc91large.jpg"}}
