But... signs in the lobby stated the shuttle doesn't start running till 8am and a 24 hour reservation prior was needed. My flight Friday was at 8am so I confirmed with the desk that nothing earlier was possible - they said nope. So I actually checked out on Thursday morning and checked into the Hilton by the airport which has a 24 hour shuttle - and got a rate $2 cheaper at a full Hilton for the night - so I could return my car Thursday afternoon.

We had flown out early and stayed here because the price was right and we were footing the bill, not the company. I stayed in a large suite with a king size bed, a couch, a desk area and small kitchenette. The room actually had two TVs, one by the couch and one by the bed. The TVs were not flat screen but old, tube ones and the reception on the TVs was horrible on one of them. The room was utilitarian, clean and comfortable but not brand new or updated. There was free wired, 100mbps Internet access in the rooms. My room faced a 4 lane city boulevard which at first I thought would be an issue, but there was little or no traffic on this street at any hour, so everything was fine. In fact, there seemed to be no one in this hotel besides us and a few other people. It seemed very empty but it was very quiet. I was on the second floor and had no problems with the elevators. The check in process was pretty quick and there was one front office clerk who was very friendly. He pointed out several sports bars where we could go to check out the World Series game that night. He also acts as the Concierge I guess. The lobby area is small but updated and also served as the breakfast area in the morning. There is an airport shuttle but there are specific hours and you have to alert the front desk that you want to use it. There is ample parking.

The hotel's location is great if you want to be near the airport without feeling like you're near the airport, if you want to be downtown (and near public transportation like the light rail) or near sporting events. However, I was warned by hotel staff and folks from the area not to go east of the hotel, as the neighborhood isn't as safe in that direction. Good advice. After learning my way around, I was comfortable walking west of the hotel to the Arizona Center where there are some shops, restaurants and a movie theatre. The hotel has a parking lot (at no extra charge) that I used since I rented a car, a small outdoor pool and a business center with 2 computers and 2 printers. It also has a small fitness room, but I did not use it. My room was sufficient - nice actually, since it was a suite. King size bed, sink area with a small fridge, microwave and counter, a fold out sofa, desk with chair and a nice sized bathroom. Some pluses about this hotel are the business center and the continental breakfast (juices, milk, cereal, yogurt, waffle maker, muffins and other breads, eggs, sausage, and other condiments), although it would have been nice to have more variety (different selections on different days) and fresh fruit. Also, a small, but extra thing - they provide towels by the pool so you don't have to bring your own. And a nice touch is the bowl of lollipops at the front desk. Some negatives about the hotel - although they have a complimentary shuttle to/from the airport - it isn't 24 hours. This isn't mentioned anywhere online so be sure to ask if that is important to you and you have an early or late flight. Also, since this hotel is right downtown, if you're looking for nightlife, PHX shuts down after 5pm. There are still restaurants, bars, and clubs - but it's not like a NYC or DC.

The biggest advantage of this hotel is its convenience to the ballpark - it's just a 3 - 4 block walk. The hotel itself was OK. I think calling their rooms \"suites\" is quite generous - the room is reasonably large, but to me, a suite is 2 rooms, not a sitting area plus a bed area. And only one small TV for the combo of the 2 areas made it difficult to watch TV after my young child went to sleep. The pluses: bathroom was good sized (split the toilet/shower vs. the sink), with good water pressure (despite high floor). The staff was very accommodating, allowing us to use their office computer to print our boarding passes for a flight when the business center was busy. Also, while I have seen some complaints about their breakfast offerings, I had no problems with them - it was the usual stuff, including bagels, muffins, yogurt, sausage and egg patties, etc. Coffee was very good and available at all times. Overall, I would say that if you will be going to a baseball game, this is a very good choice. If not, there are more luxurious places, with nicer facilities (e.g. pool, fitness center - these are rather small at the Springhill).", "Date": "April 12, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Missouri", "Title": "\u201cExcellent pick for Suns games at US Airways Center\u201d", "Author": "cmhsieh54", "ReviewID": "UR25866265", "Content": "Most of the info in the existing reviews is still very up-to-date as of Feb 28-March 1, 2009, when I stayed at the SpringHills Suites Phoenix Downtown. My main purpose for the trip to Phoenix was to attend a Suns basketball game at the US Airways Center. The lobby was very presentable, if you are visiting and you are planning to meet friends/colleagues/interviewers there. Very clean and spacious, with a few large plasma TV's. The room was very clean, I was very happy with my liberal control of the air conditioning, the staff was generally very polite, and the free shuttle to/from airport was great. Add to that the close proximity to the US Airways Center, and for me, this hotel really cannot be beat. A lot of space (my room was identical to GumboK's, see his pics). In my room was a small microwave, small fridge, and even a small kitchen sink (I posted a pic). Wireless internet was perfect, and it was completely free. I dipped into the jacuzzi in the pool area. The water was clean and at a great very warm temperature. No complaints there, it's what I would expect from a Marriott, and specifically a SpringHills. I was walking alone late on a Saturday night (I'm a 31-yr old guy) around the hotel, and I didn't feel particularly unsafe. There were no homeless people on the streets around the hotel during my stay. At the Arizona Center (3+ blocks away, about a 10-minute leisurely walk) there is \"Sam's Cafe\" (a local casual dining restaurant, a southwestern version of an Applebee's, sort of), a Greek restaurant, and other \"faster\" casual dining restaurants. I went for dinner at Sam's Cafe, and it was very reasonable (I had the Black & Bleu Quesadilla for $10), they even comp'ed me my Coke for free at the end of the meal (I sat at the bar). The free breakfast was pretty mediocre, in my opinion. Both the sausage and the eggs (are in the form like you'd get in a McDonald's Sausage Egg McMuffin, except they) taste mediocre and appear to be prepared from frozen. Let's just put it this way: after I had one sausage patty and one egg 'patty' you couldn't pay me $5 to eat more. The rest of the breakfast offerings were: orange or apple juice, coffee (decaf or caf), oatmeal, white or wheat bread with jellies, muffins, and a waffle machine where you can make your own waffles. Overall, a good value, especially if you're frequenting the Convention Center or US Airways Center or Chase Field.

I checked in and found my nicely appointed room very inviting. I dont know whether it was my Hellish night or what, but that had to have been the best shower I have ever had in my life! The bed was soft and I crashed out pretty much the second my head hit the pillow. When I was walking towards my car, I noticed that it looked as though my trunk was open. I walked over to the rear and noticed that someone had drilled out the locking mechanism and openned my truck, stealing my laptop and the Baby gift I had gotten for my Best Friend. I was [-]! I confronted the front desk and they showed me a little paper stating the held no responsibilty to stolen property, which is standard for most Hotels. I called the Police, made a report and rushed to the Target nearby to get a replacement gift. After the shower, I was fortunate enough to find a Mercedes dealership with a service department open on Saturday. They replaced the lock and had to re-key the whole car costing me 900 dollars. I stayed 2 more nights at the hotel, waking up periodically to check to make sure my car was still there. The manager was nice enough to give me a discount on my stay, which eased my anger a bit.

Although it is close, it is not 2 blocks, but rather about 5 blocks from the field. We walked there in about 7-10 minutes on a day when it was 108. Needless to say, we were glad to enter the air conditioned ballpark. Our experience is what a hotel stay should be. Reasonable rates, fairly new property, well maintained with clean, comfortable rooms and free parking. The suites, in addition to the bedroom and bath, have a small living room area, with a desk area combined with a small kitchenette. Bar sink, counter, refrigerator, coffeemaker and microwave are included along with storage cupboards below. All very convenient for travelers with cold items or those wanting to microwave. The bed was very comfortable and the pillows and linen nice and soft. We slept great both nights. The bathroom and sink area are separated by a door which we like, as one can shave/dress while the other is showering. The shower had good pressure and lots of hot water. No bath mat, nor anti-slip strips in the tub, however, and I found the footing a little slippery. The A/C was more than adequate. The room was a very comfortable temperature when we arrived, but we cranked it down a bit more. It was a little too cold at night, and we had to make some adjustments to get it right. It had a fixed louver, and it blew right onto the person closest to it in the bed during the night. That was one of our minor complaints. An adjustable louver that one could point up and out into the room would be a large improvement. The included continental breakfast served us well both mornings. Oatmeal with toppings, fresh fruit, bagels, muffins, donuts, cook your own Belgian waffles, cereal, yogurt, and all beverages. The only downside was the eggs (cooked in a round form), and the sausage. The eggs tasted powdered, and the sausage was not good. Maybe the cholesterol gods were in charge, as we tasted both, but threw them out. Yuck. We ventured to the pool on the second night. It is a small one, and as it is shallow, and it's in Phoenix in the summertime. Therefore, it was a hot one. At 10:00 PM it was probably 90+ degrees. The hot tub was nice and bubbly, but it was way too HOT (I'd guess 110 - 115). Could only stay in for a few minutes, but afterwards the pool felt relatively cool. The wired internet connection worked fine, but the wireless was intermittent. I could only get a very good connection (compared to excellent, which is ideal). As a result, sites took awhile to load, with some even timing out, which some business travelers would find annoying. We both thought that this was an excellent hotel room and a reasonable rate. We had a car so getting around was not a problem, but others without transportation should know that it is a little far from the downtown proper, and there would be a walk involved to get to restaurants, etc. . I had to concentrate to come up with the few minor points that I mentioned, and they were only minor annoyances.
