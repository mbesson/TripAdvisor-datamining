For some strange reason, both hotels are referred to as Senator Gran Via and we were dropped off at the Senator Gran Via, and not the Espana one. So we had to walk with our big luggages from the Gran Via to the Espana Hotel. I had the most disappointing time here. The receptionists are not helpful, and indifferent. They did not even have a trolley for the luggages. Moreover, when we asked them for help with shuttle service or taxi for transfer from the hotel to the train station, they had the most amazing reply - they said they can't book a taxi. Say what?! They said that we should just cross the street and hail a taxi. Thanks for the great customer service. So all 6 of us had to drag our big luggages (we are international tourists, so we had large luggages for our clothes) across the busy street to hail taxis for all of us. I don't understand why the hotel people can't help us with shuttle service or taxi-booking. Another incident that made me shake my head was when the card key of the husband of my sis-in-law wasn't working. So he went down to ask the receptionist to check the card. The guy said it worked fine, and then asked for the surname under whose name the room was registered, so the husband of my sis-in-law gave 3 surnames (since we were 3 parties traveling together). The receptionist said there was none in their database with that surname. What?! So how did we check-in? Of course, the receptionist started to doubt the identity of the husband of sis-in-law. Finally, my sis-in-law went down to show the ID of her husband. And then, inexplicably, the receptionist said that the name of the husband of my sis-in-law was in their computer. Say again?! Weird. Take note, this hotel is said to be rated as a 4-star hotel. Really? I doubt that. Never again shall I stay here. This experience sort of ruined my first time in Madrid.

Overall the property is well kept. I liked the beds, although the mattress was probably a little firm for most. The rooftop jaczzi you'll see advertised on their site is cold water, not hot. I don't know if that's a European thing that I'm not aware of, but it seemed strange. Although this was August, some of our group was actually cold as they sat out there. They did make an accomdation for a last minute room switch to put 3 of us in 1 room and have one person solo, which was nice. The free mini-bar consists of 1 for each guest: non-alcoholic beer, small Pepsi, small bottle of water, and small orange juice. They did not replace these daily as expected, because we were \"part of a group\" I thought booking 64 nights with them seemed worth providing the drinks they advertised - so this was a disappointment. The front desk staff seem to have their hands tied about most issues. If the \"person able to authorize\" things isn't around (and many times was not) - they were strangely mechanical and of limited help with most requests. Just 20 minutes before boarding the bus to leave for the airport on the way home, someone stole one of our group's laptop right in the lobby. They have a video camera facing the front door, but said they could not look at it without a police report, which we tried to file but didn't have the time to wait for the police to arrive. This was one of those \"do the right thing / common sense\" issues that didn't take place as I would have expected. The breakfast buffet that was included with the room was high quality and fresh - meats, cheeses, juices, breads, pastries, fruit, cereals, etc. If you are given an option for meals inclusive when booking, I highly recommend this.

We wanted to change from one person to two people at check in - this was greeted with an accusatory 'But you booked for one. You should have booked for two' - We didn't mind at all paying extra but we were made to feel like we had done something wrong! The hotel was blatantly empty - it was a Sunday - and we wanted to extend our room for a late check out for a fee, as advertised on a big sign on the reception desk we were enquiring at. This was so we could spend the day in their spa - again at a fee. When we asked to do this, we were told no, it's not possible. We queried why, considering we were existing customers, the hotel seemed empty, and there was a sign encouraging us to do exactly that right there in front of us on the desk. They told us the hotel was fully booked and they needed the room. So I went onto their website, requested a room for that day, and was offered a full range of rooms. I told them this, and pointed out that it was a Sunday and the hotel was obviously empty, and they said that no, it was not possible to extend. So I asked if we could leave our bags and use the spa, and they immediately barked 'Have you booked? You have to book the spa and it is fully booked. I may be able to squeeze you in but there are no lockers left'. We were in Madrid to celebrate a birthday - we had one day there and wanted to spend it in the spa of the spa hotel we had booked into - and were unable to do so for an unexplained reason. I notice that someone from the hotel has repeatedly commented on the reviews, saying it's useful for them to improve their service and so on, but this is obviously just lip service as there seems to be no change at all in service levels - and it is always the same thing complained about.

Firstly, the hotels locations is spot on, from the airport we got the metro to the Plaza de Espana station, took about 30 mins and only 1 change, once there the hotel was right in front of us, literally about 50 yards away. SO easy to get to, and the metro is only 2 euros each, much better then a 25 euro taxi. Once there, the staff were polite and helpful, and the lobby very welcoming. Our room was on the 7th floor, quick and efficient lifts in the hotel so no problem at all. The room itself was spotlessly clean, very spacious and had the most comfortable reclining beds I have ever slept in. Although the road that the hotel is on is quite busy the triple glazed windows kept the noise out. The airconditioning was also easy to use and had a good range of tempuratures ie. didn't wake up in the middle of the night frozen. We had bathroom freebie's such as comb, soap, shampoo, shoe polish, nail file etc, plus a FREE minibar!! Amazing! During the day we walked to every major tourist spot from the hotel, Retiro Park, Royal Palace, Reina Sophia, Prado, Plaza Mayor, The Rastro etc etc. If you don't like walking the metro is easy, clean and very cheap, with the station right outside the hotel. We chose to have our room without breakfast as it seemed quite expensive, which I still think was a good choice as there are some lovely little cafes very close to the hotel, which are far cheaper and far more cultural. We also paid a visit to the Spa in the hotel, which was really nice, decorated in a cave style and had sauna, steam room, jacuzzi, swimming pool, showers, foot baths plus a selection of random pools such as one with oranges floating in it!? It did smell lovely though! Make sure you check out the jacuzzi's on the rooftop aswell! Free to use and an excellent view over Madrid, including the Royal Palace. Overall I would highly recommend this hotel, and will certainly stay there again if I ever visit Madrid again. To summerise: GOOD POINTS -Best possible location and easy to get to -Very clean, comfortable and quiet -Helpful staff -Free minibar -Jacuzzi on the roof perfect for a spot of sunbathing as there are no beaches! BAD POINTS -Expensive breakfast -Room gadgets such as kettle and TV were quite old and basic, but who goes on holiday to watch TV and drink tea??

The room is definitely 4 star but the rest of the amenities, reception, breakfast area, reception were more of a 3 star standard. The breakfast area is in the basement and the hotel is busy so it's very rushed - reminded me of the package hotels you go on for holidays with all the bustling and mad rushing around of the waiters, complete with quickly depleted buffet and the noise of banging plates and crashing cutlery. The buffet selection however is very good, but you probably need to be there before 9am. I needed access to internet & printer to print off my boarding card for my return flight and the reception staff were very unaccommodating at first when I asked where I could do this, both the afternoon shift and night shift, till eventually through sheer persistence on my part I finally got told to contact the front desk manager in the morning, which I did and all worked out okay - see Pros list for more detail.

PROS: The hotel was very accommodating in that although I booked through a website and not directly with the hotel, I emailed the hotel explaining my husband & I were celebrating a special occasion and could we have a room on a high floor with a view..... which they gave us - admittedly the view wasn't much, but they also gave us a complimentary bottle of bubbly and fruit bowl!! The rooms are great with spacious bathrooms, power shower, as another reviewer said, tons of stuff and they're not stingy with it either. Reclining beds are just the thing! and the rooms really are soundproofed - and I'm a light sleeper! Free minibar - wide selection of soft drinks and 2 beers, restocked every day, which is great, also had tea & coffee - just what you need after a day of sightseeing. Location is brilliant, lots of restaurants within walking distance for the evening and metro station 30secs away. The Front Desk Manager, Monica was very helpful. I asked her if I could print out my boarding card and it wasn't a problem at all - and I was expecting the worst after the attitude I'd had the previous day! We had to wait a bit and she even offered to get me coffee while I waited. All in all I would recommend the hotel for location and the rooms itself, but as I said earlier, don't expect much in the way of reception area etc.", "Date": "May 9, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "ireland", "Title": "\u201cCan't be positive about this hotel\u201d", "Author": "laser100", "ReviewID": "UR6785768", "Content": "Talk about disappointed!For the money we spent on this hotel we were not happy.The lobby & bar area are not very welcoming.

The hotel is situated on the Gran Via towards the Plaza Espana and within 20 mins walk of pretty much everywhere worth seeing in Madrid. My wife is quite a light sleeper so booking a hotel with good sound proofing was the main priority - I spent 3 weeks searching, printing, listing and discarding!!! So it was with some trepidation that I entered the hotel on the Sunday. Unjustified trepidation. The staff were wonderful, the rooms very comfortable - wireless internet connection, free mini bar (extremely handy this turned out to be - nothing better than getting a cold drink out of the fridge at 4 in the morning), adjustable bed, great air conditioning, huge selection for breakfast etc. Price was very competititive and I would definitely recommend it. Our room was on floor 9 and we didnt hear a sound all week.
