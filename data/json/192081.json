Love this hotel for its position to Hyde Park and Kensington Gardens, just minutes away on foot. It is only a short walk from Baywater Tube and is set in the tranquil Kensington Garden Square. We had a lovely, if some what cold walk across the park to The Royal Albert Hall to see Totem,Cirque to Soleil but incorporated a visit before hand to The Victoria and Albert Museum, just down the road in Kensington High St. There are plenty of places to eat in the vicinity. On a Sunday morning you are on the north side of Hyde Park, where artists display their work to sell along the railings from 10am onwards each week. The hotel we found clean and extremely warm during our stay. Very warm bedroom, we had 3 beds in ours so probably slightly on the larger side compared to standard double rooms. May find tight for space if staying for a week or more but how much time do you spend in a room when there is so much on the doorstep to see, Continental breakfast, usual selection of rolls, toast, cheese and ham, cereals etc. Dining room busy at 9.30am but like us, most people having a later breakfast. We would definitely stay here again as the position of it is perfect. You can have a nice long walk, half an hour approximately, depending on your speed, down to Hyde Park Corner and then into Oxford Street to do some shopping.

Don't stay here if you are expecting luxury, American-style room sizes, or high-end amenities. That's not the purpose of the Phoenix. For what it is, the hotel does a very good job. I was booked in a single room (twin bed, small desk, wardrobe, nightstand, luggage stand, and a compact bathroom). The room size was small, as expected - this is an older building, and the room was pretty standard for a European single hotel room. The room was clean when I arrived, though a little worn (some scuffs on trim, somewhat worn carpet). The bed was surprisingly comfortable, with a comfortable duvet and pillows. The free wireless worked fine, and the flatscreen TV received basic cable (no Sky, for example). The bathroom was very small, with a new looking toilet and sink, but no counter space (pedestal sink and a high shelf over toilet). Shower was small but good water pressure and plenty of hot water. All looked clean at arrival and was cleaned daily. Hotel lobby is basic, but fine to hang out in if you wanted a change from your room. It was, however, unreasonably hot for almost my entire time there. Breakfast room was clean and pleasant looking, not overly fancy. Continental breakfast was pastries, breads, yogurt, cereals, some fruit, etc. Given that it was a continental, it was plentiful and good. So, what didn't I like? In mid-November, my room was bizarrely hot. I kept the heat off, window open and a fan in the window the entire time to make it bearable. I can't imagine what it would be like in summer - and would think twice abt staying there. There is only one lift (elevator). It operates very slowly, so getting in/out of the hotel around breakfast or check-in time takes several minutes. But again, not atypical for a smaller European hotel. Neighborhood is a highlight. Bayswater tube is about 3 mins, and Queensway is another 3 beyond that. Queensway (the street) is not glamourous, but has a number of food options, convenience stores like Tesco, etc. I'd recommend the Prince Edward pub a few blocks away (turn left out the front door, walk about two blocks, it'll be on your right on a corner).

There are 2 very close tube stations nearby - Bayswater and Queensway. Right, here comes the bad bit- We had room and continental breakfast. We asked to upgrade to a full English expecting to have to pay the differnece between the \u00a35 contenantal and \u00a36.60 for the full English. We were told that we would have to pay the full \u00a36.50. We waited for 45 minutes before giving up and walking out. As we walked out the breakfasts turned up. We sat back down and started to eat. After one mouthful and discovering the breakfast was cold we abandoned the breakfast and ate at one of the many aforementioned eating establishments close by. The hotel agreed not to charge us but offered no appology.", "Date": "October 27, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "2", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Thousand Oaks, California", "Title": "\u201cGood location and good value\u201d", "Author": "slr_7", "ReviewID": "UR119558968", "Content": "We stayed two nights at this hotel.

I would prefer a full English breakfast but it was free so can't complain! The best thing about this hotel was the location, it's just around the corner from Bayswater tube station and a bit further down was Queensway station.

I am surprised by the discrepancies in the ratings of this establishment. I really don't know how anyone could rate it low. First, let me touch on Trip Advisor\u2019s categories: Service Most of the Phoenix\u2019s employees seem to be non-British, including several Russian women. They were all very professional and helpful. I would not say that they are generally chipper or giggly young women; but they are professional nonetheless. The ladies that work the free continental breakfast are a hard working bunch, always keeping everything stocked. One of the front desk ladies helped us plan two daytrips, calling and reserving our spots. We were grateful for her help. I did not encounter anyone \u201crude\u201d as some previous entries mentioned. No, the Phoenix staff is not very talkative, but they are professionals. What else can one ask for?! Value London is one of the most expensive cities in the world. Be prepared to pay more than you would in the States for food and hotel. It\u2019s not just the Phoenix \u2013 all hotel rates are expensive by USA standards. But this was one of the cheapest hotels I could book thru Delta Vacations. Sleep Quality Comfortable bed; decent pillows (4 total on a double bed). We slept with the windows open every night and were not disturbed by other guests or outside conditions. Cleanliness Maid service made up our room everyday with fresh sheets and clean towels. She even straightened some things I left out (shoes on the floor, toiletries on the sink, etc). Note that towels are huge and fluffy\u2026 oversized, even. Maids fold the towels perfectly each day on the racks, and always gave us a little cookie and more tea and hot chocolate packets. I thought the maid service was exceptional. Yes, the carpet and wallpaper are a good 10+ years old; but the Phoenix is always orderly and spotless, none the less. Restaurant Only ate at the free continental breakfast each day, but this was good: cereal & milk, rolls, toast, lunchmeat & cheese, juices, etc. Very tasty. They serve it til 0945 which is more than enough time to get down there. Room Service Didn\u2019t use it. Don\u2019t know what is available. Very limited bar menu (sandwiches and drinks). This is a Best Western hotel \u2013 you aren\u2019t going to get a gourmet meal here. Duh. Spa & Swimming Pool - N/A A/C Also note that the Phoenix does NOT have air conditioning! I emailed them ahead of time and asked for an extra fan. Thus I had 2 fans to circulate the air in our room. This helped a LOT, otherwise, it gets stuffy. If you hate being warm at all, I recommend you go in a colder month or to a different hotel. The Phoenix is over 100 years old, and I doubt they are going to pay to get central air anytime soon. Bathroom I also emailed Phoenix ahead of time and asked for generous double room to \u201caccommodate my large suitcases.\u201d When I compare with the user pictures posted on here, we got a decent sized room, large bathroom, with a full bathtub/shower. The shower always had hot water and good pressure. Also, it looked like my bathroom was recently remodeled, with new tile and fixtures. Very handsome. Towels are huge and fluffy\u2026 oversized, even. Location Bayswater tube stop is a 5 min walk. So are (3) express grocery stores (Tesco or Sainsbury), where you can buy cheap food (sandwiches and salads). Hyde Park is a 10 min walk. The Bayswater area is full of ethic restaurants and souvenir shops. It\u2019s a fairly safe neighborhood. Very active with many people walking around. Don\u2019t look like a na\u00efve tourist, and you\u2019ll be fine. I live in a metropolitan area (Detroit), so I\u2019m used to being alert for weirdoes. Again, just watch yourself, and don\u2019t allow yourself to be vulnerable to pick-pockets, etc. The Notting Hill neighborhood is right around the corner. That area is very posh, with many flats and expensive cars. I felt safer there, especially at night. Very good pub over there, on Prince\u2019s Square: The Prince Edward.

My son had stayed here ten years ago, but still, I searched extensively and booked this one through Hotels.com at a very fair price for London. We were very happy in this little hotel in a very eclectic and very diversified ethnic, living, breathing neighborhood with a mall right at the corner to the NE, with drug stores and groceries nearby. The area is compact and chock full of reasonably priced restaurants of every nationality. We felt very safe here, but you have to be of open mind and be comfortable with the unfamiliar. If you are intolerant of other cultures and ways, why travel at all, really? In fact, I have NO idea why the reviews on this hotel are, at times, all over the map. Maybe the rooms vary greatly, but they were mostly quite similar on our floor. The elevator was small, but always worked and only at check out did we have to wait a bit, and only because I am in a wheelchair. The hotel itself, like many budget, or NOT, hotels in central London, is small with small rooms and without air conditioning. But it is well kept and on our visit the staff was wonderful. We were there the week of April 3rd for 7 days, were celebrating my 60th birthday, and they even gave me a card and a lovely box of Marks & Spencer chocolates. A very nice memory, indeed. The desk people were always smiling and very helpful. Every single one of them! We will certainly recommend them to our friends. We had a very adequate room on the front side, third floor, and had no issues. Everything worked, the bath was updated and had a tub with shower with loads of hot water and a great shower head. The beds were very comfy, not too soft or hard, and it was kept very clean and tidy. The housekeeping staff was friendly and always had a smile. We kept the windows open at all times and were comfortable with the fan they provided. There was a bit of noise from the young people in the little park across the street at night who would get off work and visit a bit, but not an issue if you have Mack's earplugs and run the fan. I would be reluctant in the summer on the sunny south side of the building, and possibly even on the north side, as we were. It was warm for early April in London as we only had one day of rain and it was devinely sunny and warm the rest of the week. The room stayed warm on the cool, rainy day. Our bath amenities were always replenished and tea and yummy biscuits (cookies) were always left next to the water kettle with cups and saucers. The complimentary breakfast was not bad and they at least tried to provide you with an assortment of cereals, breads, fruit, ham and cheese, and if you want a full English breakfast, you may order it for and additional cost. We found the freebie held us quite well until lunch while on tours. The juices were not very good, seemed watered down, and the OJ was bitter, so you may want to opt for tea or coffee. Located just a few blocks north of Kensington Gardens, north of Bayswater road and just west of Queensway, you have access to two Tube stations and several bus routes all just a few minutes walk away. One bus line across the street takes you to the Natural Science museum and a block from the V& A. The buses on Bayswater road take you into various parts of central London. And don't forget the bus routes to the north on Westbourne Grove Road. Learn the routes before you go and you will have a lot more fun. And really, if you are up to walking through lovely Hyde Park, you are almost a straight shot from the V&A, Buckingham Place, Piccadilly, Green Park, and so on. You can even rent a bike to make your trek. But if you buy an Oyster Card for transport you can get to practically any area quickly and for a song. Much cheaper than buying individual fares. Just keep it topped off and away you go. And all that talk about traffic being such a nightmare is very exaggerated if you are on the buses or using the Tube. Yes, they are gearing up for the Olympics and there is construction all around central London, but the delays were minimal and things keep moving even at rush hours. Remember though, if you rent a car the Congestion Zone rules are strictly photo enforced in the very central part of London and it works! We never needed a cab. A good bet for the money and if you want the Savoy or Brown's, go there instead! Personally, I would rather spend my money on the fabulous shows and tours available. Leed's Castle and Canterbury Cathedral, for example. Mind your manners and always be polite and you will fall totally in love with this most wonderful city.", "Date": "July 1, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Miramar, Florida", "Title": "\u201cGreat Location for exploring London\u201d", "Author": "fee57", "ReviewID": "UR114838576", "Content": "Stayed at the Phoenix Hotel 24th to 27th June, 2011.

We had 2 doubles and a single room, and it wasnt that cheap - our double cost \u00a3260 for two nights. On arrival, reception was poorly staffed but we were given our key and told our rooms were on the first floor. The two double rooms were small, and i mean small with just enough space to lay a suitcase on one side of the bed. The wardrobes were an adequate size but were clearly cheap DYI flat packs as they shook as you opened them. The beds - unconfortable mattresses but pillows were firm and okay. In the room that I stayed in, the bathroom stunk, it clearly had lack of air filteration, there was no bath, only a shower (although it was a very good shower). There was a small (1inch) step into the bathroom which was a very real tripping issue. My grandmothers single room, was actually a double, however the bed was shoved into a corner so only one side had access. - of about 18inches. This room did have a bath, however you couldnt open the bathroom door fully as the bed was in the way. My grandmother also struggled for space and had to park her walking stroller behind the door when in the room - nothing like a fire hazard. Not only this but the plug for her kettle was under a desk - again not easily accessible due to the small room/big bed issue. So she had to bend down to try and get to it. The hotel did not have a full english buffest breakfast choice. It was mainly continental. On our first morning, the 5 of us went down to breakfast which is served in the basement of the hotel in a VERY crowded space. the tables are all crammed together and there are cheap and nasty paper tablecloths. i wasnt sure whether it was a 'seat yourself' or 'be seated' affair so tried to find a waitress who looked bemused at my request for a 5 person table. We all squeezed in though. The food itself was a choice of toast, croissants, bread rolls, cereal, a bit of fruit, ham and cheese. I had a bread roll and some ham and cheese, the bread was stale, the ham was fatty and the cheese was at room temperature and just quite rancid. I had orange juice - allegedly pure but remarkably watery... I didnt bother with breakfast on the second morning... I thought it couldnt get any worse.... The hotel only had one lift, and it was quite small - I'd say fitting 4 people and a small amount of luggage at a squeeze. So on leaving my grandmother got in the lift on her own as there were already two people in it and we said we'd meet her in reception. The lift got stuck so she rang the lift alarm. The receptionist came over and was not sure what to do, she rang the lift company who said they would come over. She got a 'key' from her desk and tried to open the lift door but it was clear that she had no training or knowledge of what to do with this key. What appeared to be the hotel manager, came swandering over, he looked as if he couldnt care less and went back to his office. the receptionist asked a few of the room maids if they knew how to open the lift, and after some jiggling the door opened, and had to be held back whilst my grandmother and the other two hostages got out. My grandmother was shaking like a leaf, and i had to ask someone to get her a chair and some water... we got a bit of a half hearted apology and then all the staff went back to their jobs like nothing was ever happened. and the best bit.... during this ordeal, the receptionist said - 'this thing happened yesterday, the lifts been doing it recently' - im sorry but im sure thats were a little thing called maintenence comes in?

Based on all the reviews I had read about prior to check-in, I was really expecting a good value for the money. Not so. It started in the lobby check-in, and went downhill from there. Initially, my husband and I were given a basement smoking room. I would not accept this and returned to the lobby. The young woman working almost acted as if she expected to see if that would fly, and immediately handed me a new key, to a room on the fourth floor. The room was small, but that's not a problem. Overall, it was attractive and tidy. The bathroom was clean and serviceable. Our first night I awoke, jet-lagged, and couldn't remember if I was in a hotel or my twenty-year old pull-out sofa. The bed pitched in the center, causing my husband and I to roll together constantly. It was probably the worst bed I've slept in since college. In the morning (with a clearer head and better lighting), we realized there was no roll for the toilet paper, there was no bath soap, and the wi-fi simply was not working in the hotel rooms. Two different calls to fix the wi-fi brought no resolution, only rude answers from the staff. We confirmed the touchy room wi-fi connection with some other patrons who were logged -on in lobby. One night upon arrival back at the hotel, the staff couldn't find our key. No problem. We just waited till they could locate it. But during that five minutes, the staff berated us, and insisted we hadn't returned it to them. Upon further examination, they found it had been placed in an incorrect slot. We didn't pay for the Ritz, but we did pay for wi-fi, a bed comfortable enough to sleep in, and common courtesy. Great location, but I would say they got lucky there. After 3 nights, we checked out and went directly across the street to the London House Hotel. Now THAT'S a great hotel.

It's location was great (right around the corner from Bayswater tube stop) but other than that it was fairly awful. The desk staff were the most unhappy group of people I have ever encountered. Not once did any of them smile at me. The staff that worked the continental breakfast was pleasant but had a very hard time keeping the buffet stocked and the tables cleared. The hotel was WARM. Ridiculously warm. You broke into a sweat as soon as you entered the lobby and the rooms were no better. The heat was off but it didn't matter. The windows only opened maybe 3 inches so that offered no respite. There was a fan in the closet, but in order to plug it in you had to move the desk to get to the plug, and even then I don't think you could have both the TV and fan plugged in at the same time. My bed was slanted so that I constantly felt like I was going to roll onto the floor. The shelf in the bathroom was also tilted so that if you put anything on there, it was likely to fall off, and, if you forgot to close the lid on the toilet, fall straight into the toilet (which you couldn't sit on without knocking the toilet paper off the holder). The showers were nice. Small, but I expected that. The noise from outside made sleeping next to impossible; maybe it wouldn't have been so bad if I didn't need to keep my window open (I was in room 319) but I did need the window open to try to alleviate SOME of the warmth. You also had to pay 1.50 for a 1/2 hour of internet access (I instead went to Whiteley's and paid 2 for internet access with a code that I could come back and reuse until my 2 hours were up). I usually stay at the Henry VIII Hotel which is a couple blocks away, but unfortunately they were booked.

Good restaurants on the 3rd floor. There is a Marks & Spencer on the first floor that has an outstanding food section. So if you want to load up on gourmet sandwiches, drinks, baked goods, etc., for a trip, try here first. In addition, this location of Marks & Spencer also had a clothing section.

The Best Western Phoenix foot the bill sufficiently. I was glad that I was able to view photos of my single room online before I went to get an idea of just how small it was going to be: twin bed, desk, chair, small tv, armoire. No hotel parties here! The twin bed was okay...I could tell that it had been used more as a place to sit and watch the tv than a place to sleep and I ended up flipping the mattress myself so I wouldnt feel as if I was going to slide off onto the floor. I was honestly so tired after my travels everyday, that the mattress was incidental. Just like so many other reviews here have mentioned, the bathroom was tiny! The bowl of the sink was an average size which made me squeeze around it to get in to the shower; water pressure was good, towels were replaced everyday, although I thought it strange that I didnt have my wash cloth replaced everyday. I had to have someone come up and explain that one shower knob was a thermostat and one was on/off. They were very kind in explaining, as I am sure they have quite a few confused tourists! Wish there wouldve been a towel bar/shelf in the shower. I kept the shower gel/shampoo they provided on top of the shower door. Also, the small glass shelf above the sink was adequate, although I bumped my forehead on it a couple times while rinsing off my face. Ouch! Continental breakfast was satisfying, with various cold cereals, meats, cheeses, breads, etc. Thought it odd that I had to wait to be seated when there were plenty of seats, but perhaps they wanted to give this experience a more restaurant touch. The breakfast was one of the chosing factors in staying here, and it did the job to keep me sated for the morning portion of my London touring. The location of the hotel was excellent; very quiet street. I had nice view of trees (a small park?) from my window. The Bayswater Tube station was only a few minute walk and Kensington Gardens was also a quick walk of a couple blocks. The area around the corner was a bustling area of restaurants (fast food and otherwise), and shops that were very convenient. Was nice to spend one pound for an hour at an internet cafe, (instead of hauling my laptop with me) then get a snack on the way out of this small convenience store to take back to the hotel later at night. Complaints? Well, the lift for all 4 floors was slow and small, so I would sometimes take the back firestairs which were right outside my room. I also thought that hallways and lift were unbelievably warm (lots of halogen bulbs). I suppose that London tends to be cool/cold and this mightve felt nice is it wasnt early June. I guess the place could use an update for the rooms, but thats is incidental. Staff and service was excellent. Called down to front desk to get an ironing board and iron and on another occasion needed another box of tissue.(nothing like traveling while sick! Bleh!) Both times, the items were brought up immediately to my room even though there was no urgency on my part.", "Date": "June 11, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Italy", "Title": "\u201cSecond time there after one year, good again\u201d", "Author": "Achille C", "ReviewID": "UR66853954", "Content": "We went there for the second time in a year.

We were (are at the time of this review) stuck in London and lost our reservation at the Sheraton. On a combination business trip/vacation with the family.

We did move to another hotel due to the concern related to personal belongings noted below \u2013 got tired of carrying around all of my work equipment (laptop/documents, etc) every time we left the room. The majority of our costs are covered by my work. If I were paying out of pocket for everything we would have stayed at the Phoenix. Positives: \u2022The hotel is in a good location \u2022Room was clean \u2022The room with the loft area was a nice way to separate everyone for a little privacy \u2022Laundry mat very close by \u2022Bar in the lobby \u2022Free wifi (very slow, but free) \u2022Quaint and with character Negatives: \u2022Staff were clearly stressed due to the volume of people - not horrible service, but not great. Called the front desk 3 times and no one ever answered. Walked downstairs and there were always 2 clerks sitting there. \u2022Electricity for half of the room went out in the evening and had no lights in the bathroom (no windows) until the next morning. \u2022No security for your belongings at all - nothing in the room and the doors have a single standard key (not electronic). Baggage storage area (pre check in) was open and I could have easily had my pick of luggage the number of times I went in and out. \u2022Little bit of a walk to the tube - especially with young children. \u2022No heat or AC to speak of and the building is stuffy - would think twice in the summer. Summary: If you have a tight budget this hotel will work. I mentioned security above only in reference to belongings \u2013 did not see any personal safety issues.

It included slices of cheese, ham & bread, cereal, milk, juices, yogurt, croissants, cakes, fruit etc.! You can also order with an extra cost full english breakfast or omeletes etc. The staff was very pleasant and helpful with any inquiries we had. The rooms and the hotel in general were clean, sheets & towels were changed daily. The only problem was that as we noticed, every morning they were putting the new sheets & towels (the ones to be put in the rooms later) on the floor! Although from what we noticed the sheets were spotless, I don't even want to think of what could of been on the sheets & towels! The overall experience at Best Western Phoenix Hotel was very pleasant, & I would recommend it to a friend who would not want to spend a fortune for his accommodation, for sure! Just remember to bring your own towels!", "Date": "January 26, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "2", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Dublin", "Title": "\u201cGood location\u201d", "Author": "Annaleigh10", "ReviewID": "UR54343101", "Content": "I stayed at this hotel with my husband and my father for 3 nights recently.

I had a good trip, and compared to other hotels I've stayed in in London, the service was okay, the location was good, and rooms were as small as elsewhere in this pricecategory in London. However, there were some details which could have been better.... Reservations: Booked a package through a travel agency, so nothing special, but reservation was confirmed instantly. Location: het hotel is located in Bayswater, just off the larger street there with a lot of restaurants, fastfoodservice and small shops. It is a 3 minute walk from Bayswater tube station to the hotel, so excellent as well. Check-in/service/front desk: friendly personnel but average service at check-in. We asked for a twin room, but they asked us if we wanted to be \"upgraded\" to 2 single rooms located close to each other, but we declined this offer. They had all their twin rooms booked. However, there was no problem when we declined, we still got a twin room. For other questions the staff was helpful and tried their best. For example, when we had to print our boarding passes, it was no problem using the office computer, and the staff answered questions about shops and all. Room: we got a small twin room on the ground floor. The view was a wall, but I didn't come to London for my roomview, so wasn't bothered by it. As said the room was small, but I guess comparable in size with other hotel rooms in London in the same price range. But on the other hand, there were some details (or lack thereof) which could have given the room a boost. For example, there were no hooks on the wall to put a coat or clothing on. There was a closet, but that was set in the corner and it wasn't easliy opened or accessed. There were some free power outlets, but they were located behind the desk low to the ground, which asked for moving the desk in the small room, go on your knees and crawl under the desk to acces them....could have been better! the decor was a bit dated but okay. There was a watercooker and all there, as well as a tv. Overall, the room was average, but with minor changes could have been much better. If the lay-out or the furniture would have been designed to fit the room, it would have been an uprgrade for the room. I have stayed in small rooms before, but there the desk, closet and stuff was specially designed which made the room look bigger and nicer. There were 2 boxsprings, which I slept quite well on, but my friend didn't but I guess that is a personal taste thing! Temperature was good! Bathroom: clean, great shower, enough towels and apart from no space to put your toiletry bag (which wasn't that big a problem) no comments. Breakfast: average, but well maintained and friendly staff. There was bread (for toasting as well as rolls), croissants, meat, cheese, cereal, jam, chocopaste, and juices. For a small amount you could order eggs or an english breakfast. No frills in the breakfast room. Other amenities: there was a small bar in the lobby area, didn't use it but looked okay. Regarding the menu, it also served small \"snacks\" such as muffins. There were quite some seats in the lobby and it was decorated good. In the lobby was 1 computer with internet. The internet could be used for a small fee, speed was good. Overall: a great located hotel, with average, small rooms. It is comparable to other London hotels in the same price range, but with a good location. There were some minor points which were not that good, but mainly in the room amenities. As long as you go to London to see the city or at least not to be in the hotel room a long time apart from sleeping (which I guess most people are!)

The Ritz it isn't, but I wasn't expecting it to be, and it really was the perfect hotel for everything I needed in London. I was a female (mostly solo) traveller, and felt perfectly comfortable using this hotel as my base (though to be fair I wasn't out until the very wee hours). It's right near a busy and bustling street that has everything you need, but just off it which eliminates noise or any other concerns. There are two tube stations within just a few minutes walking distance, which was my mode of transportation outside of my own two feet, which allowed access to everywhere in London. Kensington Park is only a few minutes walk as well. Technically I did walk from the hotel to venues like Harrods and even Buckingham Palace, but unless you have a lot of time and energy you will probably be using public transportation to get to any of the main touristy things. The room itself was small, but no more so than any other place I'd stayed in Europe. There was plenty of room for the stand to put my luggage on, and to maneouver around it as well. The bed was perfectly clean and comfortable. The bedding etc was older, but not worn or threadbare. The bathroom was a perfectly adequate size, and very well kept. The one downside to the room and the surrounding hallways was the lack of air conditioning, however I had no problems just by using the little fan that they provided and keeping my window open (and I don't tolerate excessive heat for sleeping well). The one thing that was mildly annoying was the bulky keys/key chains, however with my large purse it wasn't an issue. I ended up using the available computer in the lobby area most evenings to keep in contact with people back home. One of the internet cafes would have been cheaper, but for the convenience at night it wasn't a bad price. Outside of one evening when a large group was taking turns, there were no issues when I wanted to use it. The small bar was very quiet and sedate even at night (pro or con depending on how you look at it). The staff were fine, though not overly helpful. I wasn't impressed with two of them - however it never detracted from my stay. They were kind enough to store my luggage in their back room the last day as I didn't fly out until later, and it was there and as left when I returned. The breakfast that was included with the site I booked through was adequate, but not memorable. Overall, I really enjoyed my stay at this hotel. The one downside was the lack of A/C, but never to an extent even in the middle of summer that I had any problems. It was also (relatively) close to the train station, however you certainly couldn't handle it walking with significant luggage - it was convenient walking there for my day trip out of the city, however for taking the Heathrow express from Paddington to the airport I did cave and take a cab there as the metro was simply too much of a hassle with luggage and walking was a little far.", "Date": "April 26, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Connecticut", "Title": "\u201cSome flaws, but a descent experience\u201d", "Author": "SigurdJarlson", "ReviewID": "UR26474977", "Content": "I stayed here for six nights.

The free wireless Internet was perfectly serviceable, even with the low signal strength I was getting. The free continental breakfast was very good with a nice assortment of breads, rolls, cereals, croissants, fruit, yogurt and juices, and the waitstaff was very polite. Its a very short walk from both the Bayswater and Queensway tube stations, so that was convenient, and the nearby street had a wide variety of useful shops and economical ethnic cuisine and fast food. Now the flaws. Despite the cool March nights, the room was quite warm and I had to sleep with my window open to be comfortable. The problem with that is the hotel is adjacent to a very busy street, so loud passersby from the nearby pubs, bars and restaurants were quite annoying at all hours of the night, forcing me to sleep with earplugs.

The building is a terrace house and the interior design is plushy, so don\u00b4t expect a modern/puristic styled place. Room: small but still reasonably sized (was able to move without hitting the furniture, no need to walk sideways).The room was furnished with a bed (clean sheets, good mattress), a desk with a chair and small tv on top, a small wardrobe and a tiny bench for luggage. There was also a hot water kettle for preparing tea/coffee. The bathroom though was very tiny (ca. 2.50 m x 1.50 m), and was equipped with a shower cubicle, toilet and a mini sink. It was ok for me as I\u00b4m just 5.5 ft. (1.65 m), but tall or big folks, think twice. The overall cleanness of the rooms was good. Breakfast: buffet: rolls, croissants, sausage, cheese, m\u00fcsli, joghurt, marmelade, jam, coffee/tea. Quality I\u00b4d say, was average. Staff: friendly, had no problems with any of them. Location: In Bayswater, you can walk to Paddington Station for airport connection (Heathrow Express, ca. 20 minutes walk), there are 2 Underground Stations near the hotel and it is a 3 minutes walks to Bayswater Road where buses go directly to Oxford Street, Piccadilly Circus and Victoria Station. The area is very tourist-friendly with many restaurants, money exchange, ticket shops, small supermarkets etc. nearby. To sum it up I\u00b4d say the Best Western Phoenix Hotel Bayswater is one of the better hotels of this price category though it doesn\u00b4t compare to the Best Western Hotels I stayed in in the States (might be interesting to know for people from the US).

If you're just using this as a place to sleep and rest, it's fine. There's a quaint little bar, a very slow computer you have to pay to use, and a decent continental breakfast buffet included in the price. The location is the best asset, it's in a safe area close to 2 tube stops- about a 5 minute walk. It's also near Kensington Gardens.

You got it. Sorry in advance ;) I am a frequent visitor to the UK, but generally stay with friends or relatives. This particular time I was by myself and decided to take advantage of London by picking a place in the city core. After reading multiple reviews about the average 3 star in London, I was prepared for the worst - I know that hotels in Europe aren't generally at the same standard as our Canadian hotels, particularly when booking a single room. First: Gatwick Airport to London Not as awful as I anticipated. If flying into Gatwick, pre-book tickets on the \"Gatwick Express train,\" which are available online. You can print the tickets and, if you are travelling overseas, save the trouble of waiting in a long line after an exhausting trans-atlantic flight. A round-trip pass costs approximately $60.00 (CAD) when booking through expedia, though it's roughly the same when converted from pounds if purchased online through the gatwick express site - and well worth the money - it saves you a world of transportation headache. The train takes approximately 30 minutes and runs every 15. It was quick and easy - far easier than the bus. The GE comes into Victoria station. Here, I would HIGHLY recommend purchasing a travel pass for the tubes - if you're a tourist, stick with zones 1-2 - any guidebook should really tell you that anyway. You can purchase the pass for approx. 24.50 pounds per week - otherwise it's 4 pounds from Victoria to Bayswater (where you get off for the Phoenix Hotel), and then if you decide to travel the tubes later you'll have to pay the full amount for the week pass. Just a tip. I accidentally paid the extra, obviously. Live and learn. The Hotel: It's approximately a 5 minute walk from Bayswater, which is about all I could handle after trudging through Gatwick and Victoria with my massive suitcase (don't worry, no big hills to attack - but there are no elevators in the tube stations and LOTS of stairs, so if you are tubing it, make sure you have a lightweight suitcase). Mapquest the directions as they are easier to follow than my instructions. The location is very ideal for anyone interested in tourism. The Bayswater tube is extremely close to all the tourist attractions in central london, and makes it very convenient when coming back to the hotel during a late night. Check-in was completely easy. Very pleasant lady at the desk. The decor was modern, clean and fresh! Adjacent to the reception area is a bar that doesn't seem to keep any particular set hours, but it's a pleasant enough area to sit and have a glass of wine when it is open. The only problem with this area is that the only internet station is set up directly across from the bar and in plain view of all the \"Lager Louts\" that had no problem harrassing me when I was trying to check my emails. As a lone girl in a foreign city, I was fairly uncomfortable to say the least. It happened on more than one occasion so my suggestion to the hotel would be to move it to a less conspicuous area. And maybe add another computer - it was really hard to get in any time as someone was always there before I could sneak in! The room itself - #114 - GREAT. Honest. Yes, there was a single bed - a twin size. Super small by North American hotel standards. But hey, I was alone and it was actually VERY comfortable. The bed was actually on an elevated platform with a staircase leading up to it, so I felt as though I had my own private loft! There is a small bathroom with a shower only (no bathtub), again, no biggie. Always clean as a whistle though and nice, modern decor. There is a desk area below the platform with the television, which was quite small and had the usual London total of four stations. Getting satelite would be a very nice customer service addition, in my opinion. However, most people aren't there to watch tv. Right? Room got HOT. I was there during a freak heat wave in the beginning of may - 25-28 degrees every day for a week, so to be fair, I don't think the hotel anticipated it lasting and if they had central AC, it didn't appear to be utilized. I asked for a fan, which was brought promptly and advertised as available in \"limited quantities\" (note to people who may be there in the summer - check in and get a fan asap) and kept it on me while sleeping and it was completely fine. There is a small safe available for free at the reception desk - use it for your passports! Safety: I generally felt safe in the hotel and relatively safe around it. I had a few late nights and the side road leading to the hotel later on in the evening is a little sketchy, but there always appears to be a gaggle of touristy-looking people meandering around at all hours of the day and night so it felt safe enough. Be on your guard generally in London, though. Breakfast: Very nice indeed! I never ate in the main room myself but usually went downstairs to grab some fruit and a bit of cereal to take up to my room with me. I asked for coffee and they brought it out to me in a full decanter on a tray - terrific service and the coffee wasn't bad - this became my morning routine! That's really all I can tell you about the hotel. It was a really nice surprise considering all the horror stories I had heard of here and from others. I wouldn't hesitate to recommend it to singles. Now note - I DID look into a room with a double bed. It was VERY cramped looking and I probably would not have been as satisfied. If I go back with my boyfriend I am honestly not sure I would book there as it looked really small for two people. However, I only got a peek or two, so if travelling in a pair, then get your info from someone else who booked a double at the Phoenix. I tried to make this review as general as possible but I am personally recommending this hotel to individuals who are travelling alone and need a single room. NOTE: This hotel was not wheel-chair accessible. Long-winded, I know, but I have tried to be as thorough as possible. Book, go, have a blast!

The bathroom is new and clean. The minuses: Interior is not horrible, but quite worn and you do not feel like walking around in your socks exactly. Colours are murky brown, orange red - and not the trendy kind either. The room first smelled of smoke so I asked to change. I wasn't greeted with a smile but they gave me another room without any fuzz. Outside the elevator was left a tray with half-eaten breakfast on the floor, and this was in the evening so it seems that there is no real inspection of the premises after the cleaning team has gone for the day. Rooms are normal in size, TV is very small and with bad reception. The cupboard smelled old dusty wood, wouldn't hang my best suit in there. The walls are thin, so if the guests next door are a noisy bunch you will hear them.

If my stay was taken in the summer then it would have been unbearable. I did seek the use of a fan, however, the hotel staff did not seem that bothered and did not provide one in the end. My colleague in another room did help out in the end. My room was a single room and it was on two levels, strange eh? The room was quite spacious for a single room and the bathroom was very clean with the shower being very hot when needed. The only problem I had was with the bed being very very uncomfortable and the tv being on the lower level away from the bed. This may seem daft but you were given a tiny chair to sit in front of it which can be very annoying after a while. The breakfast was very good with a very large selection overall. You can even upgrade to a full english breakfast for \u00a36.50.

After reading the reviews on this site about this hotel, was unsure what to expect as some were full of praise and others were not. However, we could not fault this hotel in any way. From check-in, which took only a few minutes, the staff could not have been any friendlier or more helpful than they were. The first impressions of the hotel were also very good. Outside looked very clean and inside, the reception and bar areas were lovely decorated and smelt lovely. No mustiness here. Was very nervous entering the bedroom, but need not have worried. Had booked a triple room, was big enough for our needs, after all we had come to see London, not laze around a hotel and its facilities for 4 days. There are plenty of other hotels for that type of holiday. It had 2 twin beds and then had a 3rd bed on a raised level - which our son was absolutely delighted with, claimed it was the coolest hotel room ever - and he had his own TV as well. The TV had the 5 English channels and Sky News which was sufficient. The room also had internet access. No problem here either. Just had to get a password and username from Reception and it worked perfectly for the whole time there. Our bathroom was spotlessly clean and beautifully tiled. A great relief after looking at some of the photos on this site of some of the hotels around. Plenty of hot water, clean towels, soap, shampoo, shower gel etc. For breakfast you had a good choice of cereals, toast, rolls, croissants, ham, cheese, fruit, yoghurts, juices, tea & coffee. There was cooked breakfasts at an additional cost, but while we were there, I certainly didn't see many people ordering them. Everyone seemed happy enough with what was on offer. We were nearly last into the Dining Room some mornings and there was loads of everything still available to eat. The hotel itself is in a quiet square just off Queensway. It's hard to believe that you are so close to the main street when you're actually inside the hotel. There are 2 tube stations nearby, Queensway on the Central line and Bayswater on the Circle/District line. On the morning we checked out, there was no problem leaving our cases, heading off and picking them up again later for the journey home.

First time I was there on January 2006 and my review was; \"There were eight of us sharing 2 guad rooms for 6 nights. Due to a missunderstanding, one of the rooms was a triple. Manager offered me a single room to stay for a night untill our second quad was ready- free of charge. The single room was small, but in UK terms, larger than I ever seen! I mean, traditionally, english BnBs are beehives; rooms have enough space just to sleep and get changed. This single room was larger than any other room I stayed in London and with a wonderfull view over the park across the street. The quad rooms, were \"family\" rooms; two single beds standing aside and two more single beds up 6 steps with their own TV and window- it was so lovely! Both rooms were spotless. The stuff is unbelievably hellpfull, even with people not speaking english, and they can recommend places to see and eat; their idea of eating at \"Bella Italia\" just around the corner, across the tube station was very good- real italian food in reasonable prices. Ask for the \"espresso menu\". Breakfast was the classic continental breakfast; coffee, tea, hot chocolate, nuttela, marmalade, slices of bread you can toast, rolls, cheese, ham, flakes, musli, youghurt and fruit- I found it more than satisfying. Location is... well, even if it is your first in London and you are blindfolded, you can't miss it; so close to the tube and bus stops, with supermarkets, pharmacies, clean restaurants from italian to morrocan to greek to indian just a few minutes walk away from it and a shopping center at the corner! I stayed before in the same area, but I was foolish enough not to book in Phoenix the first time... I unquestionably recommend this hotel to anyone. It is so cute and warm, so clean, so wonderfull, it is going to make your stay unforgetable. PS. If it is your first in London, concider booking a \"Classic London\" tour.

If you're looking for a luxury hotel, then the Phoenix is probably not for you. But if, like us, you were looking for a well-located, reasonably priced, clean and comfortable bed for the night, then it's a great choice. We travelled to London by train into Paddington station and so the Phoenix's location in Bayswater was perfect. From Paddington, Bayswater is the next stop on the tube and then the hotel is very close - just around the corner from Bayswater tube station. We travelled with small suitcases and found the walk quite easy and didn't feel out of place trundling suitcases up the high street! The hotel itself is located just off the main street and is easy to find. The lobby is quite small but comfortable with plenty of seating, internet access, tourist leaflets and daily newspapers etc. We arrived at midday and the staff were very good at getting us checked into our rooms. We weren't expecting to be able to access the room that early. If you do arrive early they are happy to store your luggage until your room is ready in the reception area. Check in was straightforward and there is a lift to take you to the upper floors. The rooms are fairly small (as are most in London) but we certainly weren't squeezed into the room as some reviews here would lead you to believe. We had a twin room and there was plenty of space to move around. The bathroom was also on the small side, but there was still enough room to comfortably move around and get dressed in there etc. Both the bedroom and bathroom were spotless and the furnishings were in good condition. Simple toiletries are provided in the bathroom (shampoo, shower gel, shower cap, soap and facial tissue). The continental breakfast was included in the room rate and, while not anything to get excited about, was perfectly adequate. It is a buffet style service with a good choice of Kellogg's cereals, croissants, toast, rolls, ham, cheese, yogurt, fruit, juices, tea and coffee. Simple, but all I'd eat at home so I was more than satisfied. The breakfast room is quite small so try to get there early or be prepared for a queue. Regarding the area, Bayswater is nice, not overly touristy, but easy to get to and plenty of local facilities. Within a couple of minutes' walk from the hotel is the high street which has a shopping centre, cinema, large Boots store (chemist/drugstore), Tesco (supermarket), 2 tube stations (Bayswater & Queensway) and plenty of restaurants including well-known \"family-friendly\" chains such as Bella Italia and Pizza Hut. Buses from central London stop outside Queensway tube station on Bayswater Rd - a 10 minute walk from the hotel. The area felt very safe, even late at night, as the high street is busy. Hyde Park is just 10 minutes away, and Notting Hill about a 15 - 20 minute walk. In summary then, the Phoenix offered everything we needed for a weekend break in London. We were out and about all day and during the evening, so the hotel was literally just a place to sleep for us.

We had absolutely no problems, and enjoyed our stay thoroughly. We had two different rooms on the 2nd floor, and both were rooms with twin beds. The Phoenix Hotel was booked for us through a travel agent using Delta Vacations. Out of all the walking and touring that we accomplished, I saw few other hotels as close and convenient to things as was the Phoenix, except those very costly hotels. The rooms were clean and in good repair. I was a bit skeptical after some reviews I had read, but we found everything to be great. Yes, the rooms were a bit small but not to the point of being uncomfortable. Yes, I can see why a few people complained about the heat, because our room had a small steam radiator that I could not turn off. Nonetheless, it wasn't that hot and as others have said, I simply opened the windows. I read somewhere of a complaint of street noise keeping them awake when the windows were open, but I had no problems. If you insist on sleeping in total silence, then save your foam earplugs from the airlines, and sleep with them in. We all found the continental breakfast to be good, and helped start each day out right, as we trekked throughout London and returned to the hotel exhausted each day. I particularly like the small bar at the hotel, where I would relax and enjoy a couple of pints in the evening, while talking to the bartender Jesus' from Brazil, and the other patrons from various countries. We thoroughly enjoyed being just 2-3 minutes walk from the Bayswater Tub Station where one can catch the Circle Line (Yellow) or District Line (Green). Just another \u00bd block further was the Queensway Station (Red Line). The convenience of the tub stations was outstanding, and we simply purchased four 1-day passes every day. Oddly enough, it was cheaper to buy each day than to bay a multi-day pass. HINT: Take a Taxi from the Train Station to the hotel. I found it much easier than fighting the crowds on the Tube Line, while dragging suitcases. (It was 10 pounds from Victoria Station to the Hotel). There were an unbelievable number of places to eat and drink nearby the Phoenix Hotel (on the same street as the Tube Lines) and then even more places to dine about 1 block further. AND, one of the most enjoyable days (but quite long) that we spent in London was walking from our Hotel, through nearby Kensington Park, past Kensington Palace, down to Hyde Park Corner, to Buckingham Palace, and on to Westminster Abbey. A tremendous about of walking, but the point is.... If you stay at the Phoenix Hotel, don't forget to stroll through Kensington Park.", "Date": "April 28, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "4", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Northern New Jersey", "Title": "\u201cWonderful stay!\u201d", "Author": "dp1952", "ReviewID": "UR7330029", "Content": "Got a great deal on the Phoenix through British Airways but was a bit nervous given some of the negative reviews.

In the 12 hotels I have stayed in in London, this ranks #11, just above one independent budget hotel I stayed in on Sussex Gardens near Paddington Station. I stayed in a single room. The room was very small and slightly shabby. The room was clean, carpeting clean, but there were spots and marks on the wallpaper. There was a small wardrobe at the foot of the bed with 5 hangers and half of it taken up with a shelf with a coffee/tea service on it. There was a small desk with two small drawers which had a small TV on it and telephone. There were no sattelite channels on the TV. There was a rack next to the desk for a suitcase. There was a clock on the wall above the door which was not working. The bathroom was tiny. The toilet was in a niche in the wall with about 2 inches on either side. I had to sit slightly sideways on the toilet because of the toilet paper roll just about overlapping the seat. The toilet faced the walk-in shower (which had no shelf in it), and in between against the wall was a sink with no room between with a small glass shelf above the sink. When I arrived, there was a plastic glass wrapped in cellophane with the Best Western logo. This glass was never changed throughout my 10-day stay. I probably should have thrown it away and maybe would have received a new one. There is no way you can dry off from showering with the door closed. The really terrible, unbearable thing about this hotel was that it was miserably HOT in DECEMBER. The radiator in the room was not on. The radiator in the hall was warm, so I don't know where all the heat was coming from. I spoke to several other people who said their room was very warm and they had to leave the window open. Looking up from the street, one could see many windows open. The problem with this was that you could hear all the street noise, which continued on to all hours of the morning. The hotel had a linen delivery at 1:00 a.m. right out in front of the hotel in front of my room with people unloading the truck talking loudly. Where is the consideration for hotel guests? I think cabs used this street to turn around to return to the main street. One night as I lay awake, I could hear snoring coming from the room next door. I received 6 nights for the price of 5, so the price was very reasonable, but in the end, you get what you pay for!!

Here is our only complaint: Our plane was leaving on Sunday morning and we had to be at Gatwick by 8:00 am due to all of the extra security at check-in. The subway starts late on Sundays, so we had to get a taxi to Victoria to get a train to Gatwick. We asked the people on desk if we could order a taxi in the morning but they suggested that it be ordered on Saturday night. When the cab showed up on Sunday morning, it was a minicab and the driver charged \u00a314. When we questioned the fare, the driver said \"Victoria Station is not that close.\" Victoria station is in fact 3.5 miles or 5.5 kilometres from the hotel. To give you an idea of a realistic fare, a black cab would have cost less than \u00a38.00. Mini cabs are supposed to be cheaper than black cabs. It's really unfortunate that the hotel chose to phone a company that would rip off their guests because it was our last experience related to the hotel and it left us with a sick, disappointed feeling.

The room faced the street which meant that you could hear the people coming back from the pubs, but it was not too bad. The walls though were very thin. Perhaps my neighbours were just very loud, but it sounded like they were in my room. The bathroom was small but okay and there were coffee and tea making facilities.

In some (budget) hotels you get lost easily because of all the corridors, but in this hotel it's very easy to find your room.

The staff were also very friendly. The location near Bayswater tube station is also perfect, and by purchasing an all day tube ticket, we could visit all of London's highlights.

I really wasn't sure what to expect but, all the reviews were very good. I have to say the majority of the reviews were dead on. This hotel is in a great location. You are only a 5 minute walk to the tube (Bayswater - Circle Line) and can be to Westminster in 10 minutes. You are also remarkably close to Paddington Station if you are taking the Heathrow Express. It was only a 10 minute walk from the Hotel to the station. The rooms were modest and some how we lucked out by getting a triple suite instead of a twin room. We had a room and a loft were the 3rd twin was stationed. The room was clean which was all I was looking for a place to shower and sleep. While it could use a little sprucing up, the accomodations were fine for us. The bathroom was a nice size. They had a change on the door for security and I have to say the room was very warm and we needed the window open the entire stay. Breakfast was continental and was ok enough to get you going in the morning without having to spend money. By far the best part of this hotel is the location. Queensway is home to a variety of ethnic restaurants. There was chinese, indian, thai, pubs, italian, fast food and cafes. You name it and it was there. It definately made eating at night easy. There is also a mall about 150 yds from the hotel. They have restaurants on the 3rd floor as well. I will give you our best secret. It is called Marks and Spencer. If you are looking for a quick snack, water, soda or anything to eat in your room, head there. We purchased 2 L bottles of water there for 60p and if you simply want a sandwich you can get them for 1.60 - 2.00 pound. They were great and above all help save a few bucks for dinner. My other advice if you are going is to get a tourist tube card. It can save you alot of money everyday if you use the tube. My last piece of advice would be if you are a student or have students, take you student ID, you can save a lot of money by showing it at all the attractions.

Unlike in many other cities abroad, in London the major problem with hotels of this category (3 stars or below) is the relative size and cleanness of the rooms compared to the price charged. If you're expecting amenities and spaciousness here (as I read in some previous comments), make peace with the idea that you will have to spend at least (!) twice as much. Personally, this time my need was to have just a clean, convenient, comfortable place to sleep and possibly have breakfast while leaving my belongings safely kept during my stay, because I would have to spend all day and evenings out and about in town. Room: Single. It was small but bigger than most you'd find in similar hotels: the space was used rationally so it didn't give me the beehive impression of some unpleasant experiences of the past. The bed was comfortable, clean linens and covers, two pillows... no bedbugs! The room and the bathroom were spotless. Curtains and carpet clean too. The shower was working properly (with good pressure) and of normal continental size. Security: Chain locks on the door and safe boxes downstairs. Breakfast: Good. Offered all the basics: juices, milk and yogurt, choice of cereals, cheese and ham, jams and honey, breads and croissants. English breakfast option upon request (not included in buffet). I'd suggest not showing up at the last minute or you'll most probably have to queue up, the room will be crowded and the staff busier. The breakfast room, may have small iron bars at the windows (as someone pointed out) but at least this one has good natural light... breakfast rooms of other 3 stars hotels were in basements lacking windows and fresh air altogether. Location&Transport: Extremely convenient. I needed to be flexible and independent in order to meet different people in different parts of town and indeed it was never a problem. Besides the tube, look into buses on both ends of Queensway so you'll enjoy additional sights of the city. Note that Queensway tube station is closed until May 06. When I'm flying to&from Heathrow, I personally prefer taking the Express (15 min only vs almost an hour by tube). Paddinton-Hotel: you can either walk (15min), grab a black cab (5\u00a3), or take one of the many buses (one bus stop journey).

This was my 2nd trip to London and the hotel was exactly as the positive reviews described (I stayed at the Ascot not far from this hotel on my first stay - my review is on TripAdvisor). Check in was a breeze and the front desk were cordial. I had a double room that was on the 2nd floor. Although compared to American hotels, it was a small room, it was a normal European double room. I wasn't there to lounge about or entertain guests in the room and was only in the room to sleep and shower. I am very meticulous about cleanliness and this room fit the bill. The sheets and towels were changed each day. There were no odd stains on the carpet, curtains or bed linen. The bathroom was sparkling clean and modern with an overhead shower. I was concerned about facing the street but the noise level was fine. The only instance of loudness was a jackhammer at 9:30a.m. one morning, but that's normal operating hours for street work anyway so I can't complain. There was a very small tv in the room that I wish were larger but I wasn't in London to watch tv anyway so I didn't mind. Regarding safety, the room had a chain lock, which not all European hotels have and a \"do not disturb\" sign which was very helpful as maid service made their rounds very early each morning. The inclusive brekfast was great! The staff were pleasant and quick to clean the tables as guests waited for tables. It was VERY crowded at the hotel and there was a small wait 3 of the 4 days I had breakfast there, but it was included in the price so again, I can't complain. For those who do complain about the menu selection, they are probably used to American hotels and mistakenly expect the same standardization of large breakfasts in European hotels. I had cereal, milk, bread, ham, cheese, juice and tea each day. If I wanted somthing different I could easily have gone to any small cafe or fast food chain around the corner. The neighborhood was very lively with a large Middle-Eastern community. While there was Internet service in the hotel lobby for a fee, there were several Internet cafes around the corner which I stopped by each day. The only craziness I encountered was Waitangi day which took over the tube for one day so I had no problems taking the bus as an alternate.

It probably had my expectations higher. I got to the Phoenix and realized the location just wasn't as great. I preferred being in the west end. With the Phoenix you had to take the tube to get pretty much everywhere. One of my biggest problems with the location was that I wanted to go to a club or bar in Leicester Square at night however because the tube stops running at around midnight I would have to find a taxi and pay a lot or take the bus back. I couldn't just walk back in less than 5 minutes like I could at the Charing Cross. Otherwise the location was fine because the tube got you anywhere. As for the room, I got a single room. It was small, but that's fine, I was a solo traveler so I didn't need huge. The bed wasn't great, just average. The room was on the warm side even with the window open. It was pretty clean though. The free breakfast was average...better than nothing as it had breads with all sorts of spreads, cereal, coffee, ham, and some fruit. One thing I noticed is that all the staff was foreign whereas at the Thistle many were British. So some couldn't speak english well. The lady at checkin was rude. So service wasn't great.

The television seemed to be mistuned, with no satellite available, there was no radio in the room (I ended up leaving one there I had purchased for the next guest) and what point is it having a Kettle if the jug doesn't fit into the bathroom sink to be filled up? Also, a toilet right next to a huge window which meant, if using the toilet with the light on, EVERYONE outside could see through the mesh curtain.

The Price The price was fantastic. I got a deal from another website which meant I got this hotel for less than other, obviously nastier places. The Staff Many of the staff didnt seem terribly interested in being helpful at all. I had to ask 4 different waitresses in the restaurant how I ordered something from the menu for breakfast and was each time either told to wait and forgotten about, or in 1 case just had a finger held up to me to wait. I was quite shocked by it. The bar staff however, were very nice, and keen to start conversations. The Other stuff There was building going on in the building next door which, unfortunately started at 8 every morning and involved drilling and nailing directly against the wall my bedhead was at. Not the hotels fault, just something to be aware of if your in a room near the far end of the building. Luggage storage is free which was handy. Laundry service however was INCREDIBLY overpriced!

I got an awesome rate of 66 pounds per nigt (inclusive of the VAT) at hotels-london. This was half the price quoted at all the other popular hotel reservations sites. The hotel was within 2 blocks, maybe a 5 minute walk, to the Bayswater tube stop (exit the tube, turn left, turn left at the mall/gallery, and the hotel is a short block down on the left). Because our flight arrived at 9:30 AM, we were at the hotel well before check in time; however, our room was quickly prepared so we could drop our bags and head out. I was nervous about the size of the room after reading reviews about all the London hotels, but the size was just fine for sleeping and decompressing. It had large windows that overlooked the small square. No AC here, so I would hesitate about staying here in warm weather. The street was quiet, and we slept one night with the windows open, something I couldn't imagine doing in a big city. The bathroom was in almost new condition with mable tiles. Very clean and comfortable. The continental breakfast is exactly how it was described here: predicatable. However, since our trip took us all over Europe, we found that every hotel has virtually the same continental breakfast: bread/rolls/croissant, ham, cheese, cereals, milk, juices, coffee, fruit (usually canned), yogurt. The difference here was the presentation. At the Phoenix, you were seated in the restaurant area with beautifully set tables, and you made your way to the buffet room. Empty plates were cleared immediately. Very nice. As is the US custom, we thought we should tip the waitresses, however no one else was. We found out from our European friends that tipping is different in Europe. Most include the tip in the check, and if you would like, you can leave an extra Pound or Euro. Tip: look at your bill in London to see if the tip has been added! Tour tickets are sold at the hotel lobby desk for the same prices as at the attractions themselves, so save time and get them at the hotel if you don't have a London Pass. We found the Phonix hotel to be clean and well kept for such an old building. The staff was very professional, too. The neighborhood was packed with small restaurants of every kind, and cheap internet access was easy to find, at about 1 Pound an hour. I have recommended this hotel to my friends and family and would stay here again fall-spring. It is a great location, so close to everything, quiet, clean, and a professional staff.", "Date": "June 2, 2005"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "BEST WESTERN Phoenix Hotel", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g186338-d192081-Reviews-BEST_WESTERN_Phoenix_Hotel-London_England.html", "Price": "$136 - $266*", "Address": "<address class=\"addressReset\"> <span rel=\"v:address\"> <span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">1 - 8 Kensington Garden Square</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:locality\">London</span> <span property=\"v:postal-code\">W2 4BH</span></span>, <span class=\"country-name\" property=\"v:country-name\">England</span> </span> </span> </address>", "HotelID": "192081", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/ProviderThumbnails/dirs/df/9b/df9b9d3046a643fea0e139c14f7ff4333large.jpg"}}
