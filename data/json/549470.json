{"Reviews": [{"Content": "Good hotel in a good location I booked five nights here through hotels.com for around $110 per night. The Akasaka area is great, plenty of places to eat with very varied cuisines. There are almost as many Italian, Spanish and French places as there are noodle and sashimi restaurants. It's quite a business-oriented area close to the tall Biz Tower, which also means a good supply of coffee shops and convenience stores are close by for breakfast. The hotel also has an Italian restaurant attached, which was reasonably priced for good food.The hotel is quite swish and compact. Decent coffee in the lobby with speedy and friendly check in/out. I had a single room which was so short on floor space I couldn't even leave my suitcase open! Once I'd taken out what I needed all was well though and it's actually a very efficient use of space. Not cramped, not claustrophobic, just little. The door to the bathroom is clear, colourless glass, obviously not an issue in a single room. Internet connection is fast and free, kettle for making tea and an empty fridge for keeping cold things cold. All it really lacked was a place to hang more than two shirts!Other reviews mention the location, being at the top of a short, steep hill or a long flight of stairs. As a result of this, and the hassle in getting to Akasaka metro station from Tokyo railway station with luggage (you need to change lines and it's a lengthy walk up and down stairs between lines and once at Akasaka) I arrived on a humid, hot afternoon wishing I'd just taken a taxi. Unless you only have a small suitcase, or are carrying a backpack, then from Tokyo railway station you're better off going on the metroto Akasaka-Mitsuke, which doesn't require a change of line, and hailing a taxi for the short ride to the hotel, or spending the extra and taking a taxi directly from Tokyo station. Akasaka station is only one one line, but Akasaka-Mitsuke, about 10-15 minutes walk away, is on several and is very useful.", "Date": "Sep 5, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR319542488", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "gsnichol"}, {"Content": "Ten out of ten - this little hotel ticks all of the boxes I'd never stay anywhere else in Tokyo.The B Akasaka is stylish, affordable, ideally located and has free coffee and net access around the clock.

I've just spent a week at the B Akasaka and am very happy with the stay. After reading all the reviews about the tiny hotel rooms and beds in Japan, I was pleasantly surprised. I would definitely recommend the rooms for singles. The bed is amply sized and there is obviously no issue with the lack of privacy in the bathroom. I was particulary pleased with the cleanliness and modern look and feel of the hotel. They also provide a number of extras eg. pjs, slippers, toiletries eg. toothbrush/ toothpaste/ cotton buds/ shampoo/ body wash. The availability of internet in the rooms was a major plus as well (connection was always available and speedy).I had no issue with the location either but can see that travellers with a lack of fitness may struggle (or need to get a taxi), as the hotel is off the main road and up a number of stairs or up an incline.", "Date": "May 29, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR252145784", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "3"}, "Author": "b12Adelaide"}, {"Content": "Good value, convenience       front of b akasaka from across street at night", "Date": "May 10, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR708198445", "Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Business service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "BDWarr"}, {"Content": "not bad I'm here right now.

The rooms were bigger than I was expecting given all the hype about tiny rooms in Tokyo. The bathroom was large enough, but it was built fishtank style with frosted glass up to about eye height, meaning you can see in from the room. It doesn't pay to be shy.As far as location goes it was pretty good. There are hundreds of restaurants just around the corner and the Akasaka Metro station is only a couple of 100 metres away, except that line isn't all that useful so to get anywhere you generally have to make two or three changes.

We wanted somewhere nice, central and inexpensive. Having read the reviews we opted for B Akasaka. It fitted the bill perfectly. Akasaka, primarily a nightlife area, is in the heart of Tokyo. The hotel, in a quiet office cum residential part of Akasaka, is only 5 minutes walk from a subway station, restaurants and bars. It is a renovated business hotel which now looks boutique like. Ambient lighting in the lobby etc. The rooms are small but comfortable and a bit chic. The compact bathroom was quite cool. We didn't need a wardrobe or drawers, which is just as well as there weren't any! This really is a place for a short stay. Service at check-in was typically friendly. At Yen 20,000 for a double room this was good value for the centre of Tokyo. A bit of advice: as the hotel is at the top of short but steep hill don't arrive by subway if you have baggage.

A friend and I stayed at the B Akasaka for two evenings. This was a great value for the amount we paid ($150 per night for two twins). We were very impressed by how modern the hotel was and all the amenities (refrigerator, flat screen, nice lighting, robes, slippers, awesome coffee, computer in lobby). The rooms were quite small but were fine for our needs. Bathroom is very modern with many nice features but is separated from room by frosted glass which took a while to get used to. We really enjoyed the neighborhood around the hotel. It is walking distance to lots of bars and restaurants. We enjoyed being in a quieter part of town but having lots of options of things to do. There is a restaurant in the hotel but we never ate there. We found it easy to take the subway to other parts of Tokyo (Shinjuku, Asakasa). On the way in we took the subway to a central location (Ropongi) and then got a cab to bring us to the hotel. This was a good plan and was only 1200 yen or so.

All bathrooms are separated from the bedrooms by a transparent glasswall. It's nice but not necessarily appropriate.Beds are small, working table is nanoscopic.Breakfast is ok.
