Water pressue in the shower was very poor in the AM, and the plumbing was very old, as evidenced by a toilet that was constantly running after being flushed. They were very inflexible in terms of a late checkout, even after a 4-day stay and the likelihood of many more stays to come (given that I travel to NYC every 2-3 weeks).

For breakfast the continental was all patries and bagels so maybe try cafe straight ahead as you leave hotel 2 mins away on 27th st (opposite Museum of Sex so maybe not if you have chidren with you) though hotel tea and coffee on tap 24-7 is really useful. For dinner, try the irish bar on 30th and Broadway (next to ground level car park), friendly vibrant atmosphere (british football if you want it) with great New York Strip and Sirloin ($25 and well worth it).

The one thing I would say is having read previous reviews when approaching the hotel on broadway from herald square you do feel very vulnerable but nothing happened and we were fine. The building opposite has a nightclub on it's roof so on a fri and sat night there are a lot of people around from that.

The smallest shower I have ever used. The room is noisy for two reasons, the window was facing the back alley and was near some big industrial unit that was noisy, plus the street noise from the Broadway. The most annoying was the noise from the water pipes, if somebody next door was using their bathroom the noise in the room was loud. Continental breakfast was a joke. They provide bagels and something that looks like Philadelphia cheese. There are croissants and cupcakes as well. The coffee and orange juice taste awful. So, forget about the breakfast and go grab a nice one outside. Overall, this place feels like a better hostel and not a 4 star hotel.

The hotel lobby is small, but very nice and clean. The staff is excellent- very polite and willing to help. The only annoyance is waiting for elevators- there are only two to service the 13 floors, but it's manageable. Our room was clean and decent size- we packed 4 adults in the room. Very clean, though there was one creepy thing- two small child handprints on the back side of the bathroom door. Creepy, but I'd deal with a lot of weird handprints to save some serious cash (especially with the cost of dining in NYC!). The breakfast was an excellent perk- I recommend getting there early if you want a seat, it's pretty small. Sweet rolls, bagels, donuts, coffee, tea, milk, juice. Very nice- saves you the cost of breakfast in this phenomenally expensive city. The location of the hotel was mostly good- about 10 steps from the subway station (28th street). Very easy to hop on and head downtown to Chinatown, SoHo, Ground Zero. It was just a tad sketchy of an area-- weird stores in the immediate vicinity, selling wigs and all sorts of bizarre crap. Someone said it was a West African neighborhood. A little strange also because everything seemed to close up around 7pm- though this was the city that never sleeps? Guess not in this part of midtown. Just head down to 23rd/5th ave and you're back in civilization. Side note for all you budget travelers-- there is an EXCELLENT diner on 23rd, almost to 7th avenue- next to some lobster place called Malibu Diner. Typical Greek diner with great food and INCREDIBLE prices (pretty much the same as we pay here in the suburbs of Chicago for a meal). Great, great place. Found it the last night we were there- such a bummer! Just a 15 minute or so walk from the hotel. Final thought- do not take the car service they offer at the hotel. They charge $50 to go to LGA (though you don't have to tip). You can easily take a cab (as long as you're not traveling during rush hour) for $40 including tip.

This is a good hotel with large, clean rooms, is quite reasonably priced (for NYC) and a helpful staff that is convenient to several subway lines. Definitely a good value for the money. We had a room on the second floor, so we didn't have a great view that others have mentioned, and while that would have been nice, it wasn't a big deal. The room was quite spacious with two queen beds, a dresser/TV combo type thingy, a desk and a small table. The room was very clean and while the carpet seemed a little old it wasn't gross or disgusting. There were a few oddities to the room. I'm not sure if this was an old office building, but there was a set of fluorescent tube lights in the ceiling of our room (right as you walked in) and the ceiling tiles seemed as if they should be in an office building. The type of tiles didn't lead to it being noisy, though. The exception was in the bathroom - I could hear the hair dryer from another room somewhere one morning although that was coming through the air vent. Another oddity as far as the room goes: we could hear the subway (N-R-W trains) as it went below the building down Broadway. It wasn't distracting or bothersome, but you could definitely hear it, especially in the bathroom. The room was large, comfortable, clean and gave the four of us enough space. The breakfast was OK - a typical continental breakfast of bagels/cream cheese, doughnuts, some danish and juice. Since it's included in the price of the room, it's enough to get you going and keep you going until lunch. Two mornings we got there a little late and there wasn't anything left, so if you're going, go early. Thankfully in NYC there's always a street vendor nearby to get breakfast from cheaply if the food is gone. The staff was helpful as well. The doorman was able to set us up with a car service to LaGuardia for our return trip as well as answer questions about things in the area. The folks at the front desk were quick to check us in and out and when we called down they brought us extra pillows and a rollaway bed (my stepdaughters seemed to have trouble sharing a bed) promptly. The neighborhood is interesting - it is definitely not a touristy area. There are lots of little shops to sell you electronics, fashion accessories, etc. Some are wholesale, some not. I felt safe in the area, both daytime and nighttime. It does get very quiet at night, but even at 11:45 at night there were still a few people around. Just don't be a stupid tourist standing on the corner, counting your money, looking lost and/or waving your iPhone about (that behavior will find you trouble anywhere) and you'll be fine. There's also a little convenience store around the corner (27th street) called \"My Place Deli\" that's great for picking up snacks, bottles of water, etc. I didn't try the deli food so I can't comment on that. Several subways are close by. You can get the N-R-W trains at 28th and Broadway (a block from the hotel), you can catch the 6 train at 28th and Park Ave S. or the 1 train at 28th and 7th Ave. The last two you have to walk cross the avenues (east-west, not north-south) so they're a little further than the N-R-W trains but they're still easily walkable.

The staff could not have been more friendly or approachable...willing to help with any of our needs.

AND LOVELY FRESH, WHITE TOWELS. Every day our room was 'made up' - bed made, fresh towels and toiletries; it was quite humid in NYC at the time, so the very effective air conditioning was wonderful. The continental breakfast consisted of piles of bagels, doughnuts and pastries - fresh fruit provided (apples and oranges) juices and tea & coffee on the 4th floor dining area.

They also had an out sourced room service which was good for breakfasts, but did not supply all items listed for evening meals - but the burgers, chips and salad which were available - were delicious!

We arrived in NY in the morning, before check-in, so we visited a museum first thing. I arrived at the hotel at 2:30. Check-in is at 3, but having travelled extensively I had never had a problem checking in that close to the time. I was shocked when they told us that the room was not ready. The attendant at the front desk did offer a waiting area on the 4th floor to have tea or coffee. But I still found it surprising that they were not ready. When we did get to check-in we had trouble getting to our room, which was on the 13th floor. After asking one of the staff, we discovered that our room was the only room on the 13th floor and the only elevator that went that high was the service elevator! It was a little odd. The storage closets were right next to the room, so you could hear the staff going in and out for supplies and talking amongst themselves. As another reviewer had mentioned, the lights are florescent ceiling lights (like in an office). Our floors were all tile, no carpet! The thing that made up for this though was an absolutely fantastic view of the city. There was a perfect view of the Empire State Building. It was snowing as well and watching the clouds and snow whirl around the buildings was def. was one of the most memorable aspects of my trip. There was a good spread at the continental breakfast. I'd advise stopping in early. It opens at 7. I went at 7:20 and the room was already crammed with people. Coffee, tea, OJ, cranberry juice, fruit, muffins, pastries, bagels (with a toaster).

Do not expect frills or glamour, but it is clean, recently renovated, and close to a lot of attractions. About 8 blocks to Times Square, and several subway stations, each about 2 blocks away. The bed was super comfortable, linens soft and clean, plenty of pillows, and a clean bathroom. The furniture and fixtures are new and modern (no soiled linens, carpets, or chair coverings) in fact, everything was spotless. Of course, when you go to NYC it depends on what you're looking for in a hotel. The entrance was nothing more than a door and an awning, but there is a doorman who offers to call you a taxi, and (obviously) opens the door for you. Also, they are serious about security about checking your room key after hours. The lobby is small; what you see in the picture on their website really is all there is. (But how much time are you really spending in the lobby?) Someone commented on \"slow lifts,\" but I didn't notice any problems with them. If I had to complain about something (which I really have to look hard) is that the lighting in the room was odd. It very well could have been an office building transformed into a hotel. There was a flourescent light above the doorway and the rest of the room was lit by lamps. It seemed to take lighting all the lamps to get good light for the entire room, but this wasn't a problem, just worth commenting on. It is really a good bargain.

The Broadway Plaza is located conveniently on 27th Street an Broadway. It is an ideal location: Herald Square (including Macy's and the Empire State Building are just 6 or 7 blocks away ~ roughly a 10 minute walk), there are subway stations within a couple of blocks, and buses to both downtown and mistown are wirhin easy reach. Some people have mentioned the area it which the hotel is situated is not particularly great, but as three young(ish!) girls, we did not encounter any problems on either of our trips, even late at night. The hotel itself is clean, tidy and confortable. It is not the most luxurious hotel I have ever stayed in but, to be honest, if you're in NY you will not want to be in your hotel room for very long! Nevertheless, it is nicely decorated and perfectly adequate for a shopping or sightseeing trip. The bathroom is also spotless and room service good. The only slight complaint I would have is that the TV only had a couple of channels which were properly tuned in... but, as I said before, you will not have time for much watching TV in NY!!The view is fantastic of you manage to get one of the rooms facing the Empire State building (we actually requested this when booking online). The rooms on higher floors have the best view but these are the smaller rooms. The first time we went we were upgraded to a Junior Suite - this was HUGE and had a seating area, etc. The second time we had a superior room , which was very nice, just smaller, but as I said, the view was better. The breakfast is good, a range of bagels, cereals, donuts etc but we most;y went out for breakfast... try Greenwich Village for a lovely al fresco meal!! This is only about 25 minute walk from the hotel. With regards to eating out, good restaurants are fairly sparse in the immediate area but you will probably want to explore a bit any way... my personal favourites are Little Italy, South Street Seaport and the Boathouse in Central Park. However, we did find a couple of lovely restaurants nearby: Blue Smoke (on 27th near Lexington, this does barbecue type food and has a jazz bar downstairs... great atmosphere) and Ilili (on 5th between 27th and 28th Street, this is the best Lebanese restaurant I have visited!) I would not think twice about where to stay in my next visit to NYC. The staff are great and will do all they can to make your visit a pleasant one. They are happy to hail cabs, book transfers to the airport... they even arranged for my boyfriend to send us a bottle of champagne when we were there for Valentine's Day!!", "Date": "June 20, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "2", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "1", "Check in / front desk": "2", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "California", "Title": "\u201cShady area\u201d", "Author": "Carlii1964", "ReviewID": "UR17061397", "Content": "I read reviews and they were mixed, but I didn't think this place would be this bad.

I can honestly say that as we neared the hotel in our taxi, having come from Newark Airport via the Holland Tunnel (I think), the area did not give a good impression at all. The hotel is actually above some shady tat shops and a very grotty pizza restaurant, surrounded by intimidating \"hoodie\" or \"homeboy\" type gangs which is sad because this is an okay hotel. We were greeted courteously and shown to our rooms, which were reasonably clean and comfortable. There were a few suspect stains on the carpet and iron burns. The bed was comfortable and the linen was clean. The bathroom was rather dated with a 1970's pvc type cubicle within the bath instead of tiling. Again it was clean and the towels fresh. Another reviewer has mentioned the 1970's polystyrene type tiles on the ceiling and neon strip lighting, this is a bit of a naff element and simply changing this would probably brighten and modernise the room. The view was okay, better than some New York hotels as you can see the Empire State from the front (and probably the side) of the building. The room size is also above average I would say and all in all this hotel is...just okay really. I have no complaints about the staff, they were all reasonably pleasant. The breakfast facilities weren't great as the room is rather small and you have to wait ages for the elevator, balancing your breakfast while you wait. There is a microwave and coffee, tea and orange juice available 24 hours. The location is great, it's central and close to the subway station, if you cross the road straight ahead from the hotel and walk down 27th street you will get on to 5th ave, another member's advice was to cross here to walk up town rather than walking up Broadway as the unsavoury characters do congregate along this stretch of road. A Metro card is well worth your while (I can't remember how much it was but well worth the $ whatever it was).

We stayed at the Broadway Plaza for 3 nights having booked direct with the hotel. I can't compare it with anything else in New York as I've never stayed there before but I'll tell you what I think. The hotel is situated on the corner of Broadway and west 27th street so its actually only about a ten minute walk from Penn. station if you're coming in from Newark on the train as we did. The streets around the hotel are not the smartest as this hotel is in the garment district but we had absolutely no problems. If you're at all nervous then our tip would be to walk a block across to Fith Avenue instead of walking up Broadway, its nicer, This section of Broadway has a few groups of hooded locals hanging around during the day but its fine at night and as I said they were no problem at all but I can imagine some people would be a bit nervous. The hotel itself is fine, I paid about \u00a3130 a night for a double with breakfast included. I think this is maybe a fair price for New York. Our room was on the 10th floor with a great view of E.S.B. The air con. system in our room made a loud whining noise a couple of times even though we weren't using it. Pretty poor really when you're tired and it starts at 4 a.m. I called down to reception and they told me it happens a lot and to turn the air con on and off so they obviously know there's a problem.. The room itself was clean and comfortable and the bathroom etc was fine so no problems at all other than the aircon and the staff were friendly and helpful. Breakfast is machine coffee and orange juice and a selection of pastries and muffins which is ok for a quick start to the day but for anything more cross the street to the \"Naturally tasty\" diner which has more traditional eggs and stuff.. There's no restaurant and the breakfast room is about 4 little tables so don't expect lavish surroundings. There is a room service menu with reasonably priced food being delivered from a local cafe/ restaurant but we didn't use it so can't comment. We didn't use the T.V really so don't know about channels etc but there were pay per view channels etc. It was $9.95 a day for wireless broadband in your room if you have a laptop. About a block or 2 over there is internet access in cafe 28 if you need to check in on line etc for your return trip.

We booked mainly for the inclusive breakfast and the high standard of cleanliness. However on both points we were very disappointed. The room - despite having paid extra for a 'superior' was very small and very dark, needing the light on even first thing in the morning; and although we had a great view of the Empire State Building there were no chairs or tables to sit at if we brought our breakfast back - which we had to do as the breakfast room was always full and extremely hot! On the subject of breakfast - forget the hotel and walk across town rather than uptown, where there are some superb and very cheap cafes - forget the one next door to the hotel - it was FILTHY. We stayed for 4 nights in this hotel and on check out could write our names in the dust on thr bedside table. Also, toothpaste spilt on the sink on the first night of our stay was still there when we checked out. (We deliberately didn't clean it up just to check how long it remained there.) On the first day we reported that the bath plug didn't work, it took 2 days before it was fixed. Another gripe - considering we arrived in the middle of a heatwave - each evening when we returned from dinner, someone had been into the room and turned the air conditioning off. Not a major point - but very annoying. (Especially as that person had used the loo whilst in the room.) Good points were definitely the door staff - Anthony and Angel were great. I've been to NYC before, but they gave loads of advice where to go and how to get there. Recommend using the subway with a Metro card (if you go the wrong way - it costs nothing to go the right way.)

We booked it as part of a joint airline/hotel package through Travelocity and did save several hundred dollars by doing so. Never again will we skimp. Next time we will pay the extra money to stay in the Time Square area. Technically, there's nothing egregiously wrong with the hotel, but it misleadingly advertises itself as a \"boutique\" hotel. This couldn't be further from the truth because there's nothing boutique about it. An \"economy\" hotel would be a better description. The building itself was okay; however, when we arrived the main elevator bank was being worked on (never a good sign), and we had to wait several minutes before we could even go to our room. (There are two elevator banks - one that goes only to the 7th floor and another that goes all the way to the 13th floor). The rooms are clean and appointed well enough, but there are no frills. No extra seating, and the lighting is not the best. No wi-fi or coffee maker. The bed was comfortable, and the bathroom was very spacious by New York hotel standards. This is our 4th trip to New York together, and I used to live there, so I'm familiar with enough hotels to have a basis for comparison. The best asset of this hotel is its staff. They were hospitable, greeting us every time we entered the hotel and holding the door for us when we left. They left us extra towels when we asked for them and also provided satisfactory lunch and dinner recommendations. They would not, however, accommodate an late checkout request. The continental breakfast was serviceable but not the best. Orange juice, coffee, bagles, doughnuts, a few muffins, and a few turnovers. Hardly what I would call a bountiful selection, and the pastries were dry and not that good. The second morning we took advantage of the breakfast we got there around 8:40, 20 minutes before it ended. (The breakfast is only provided from 7:00 to 9:00). All the pastries were gone. The woman in charge of the breakfast area didn't take the initiative to restock even though there were several people waiting in line. (The room, by the way, is tiny and cramped and does not have adequate seating). When I asked her if there were any more turnovers, she didn't even speak to me but instead set about restocking. Her attitude was unpleasant, though, as if she were doing me a favor begrudgingly. I wasn't impressed. Another reviewer mentioned that this hotel probably used to be an office building, and I can definitely see this. Every floor is laid out differently, kind of chopped up in its floor design, and I wondered why there only seemed to be 6 or 7 rooms on each floor. The hallways had a funny smell (the rooms were okay, though), and the lighting was dim in the hallways as well. The decor wasn't warm or inviting. All of these items aside, the main problem is this hotel's location. This hotel is in an unsavory area, and I'm saying this as someone who's lived in different areas of New York. It is right on Broadway, but it's in a sort of \"no-man's land\" of midtown. By day, it is a little creepy because there are nothing but vendors and roving packs of young kids and thugs. It's an impoverished area, and there's nothing in the immediate area that would attract other tourists, so you are surrounded by masses of locals. If you walk one block north to 28th street, you can catch the NR subway line. If you walk two blocks west over to 7th Avenue and 28th Street, you can catch the red 1 subway line, which is okay by day, but very scary at night. At night, all of the streets around the hotel are desolate, especially the cross blocks. All the shop fronts are gated, and there is hardly anyone around and very few other businesses. It is creepy. On the final night of our stay, we were out late in the Village and took a cab back to the hotel around 1:15 in the morning. Approximately 6 blocks south of the hotel and one cross block over (on 6th Avenue), we encountered swarms of gang members blocking the intersection and preventing traffic from moving. There was an NYPD car in front of our cab that did nothing in spite of the fact that there was gang fighting and violence occurring on the right side of the street. It was a very tense, petrifying few moments as the gang members rushed across the street dodging in and out of traffic. I hurriedly rolled my window up, but was so thankful to finally get back to our hotel. However, I did not sleep well that night because I was so shook up and disconcerted by the fact that this all happened in such close proximity to where we were staying. In short, if you want to be in the heart of the theatre district and withing close walking distance to most of the midtown attractions, this is not the place to be. The hotel is spartan and is in an extremely dicey, unsafe area of town. I did not feel entirely comfortable there, and my partner and I will not stay there again. The few hundred dollars you save aren't worth it.

No where to sit, no restrooms, only a couple of people behind a desk serving the hotel guests checking in or out. The lights inside the room weren't lights that you would normally see inside a room. It was a huge fluorescent light that you would see inside an office to offer lighting over once's desk area. The light happened to be over the tv area. There wasn't anywhere in the room to lounge, just two beds and a small desk with one chair. The bathroom was huge only because it was a closet for supplies in the past. The tub enclosed shower had mold growing in thick layers in the corners of the shower. Although the water was hot, I can imagined how much mold/spores I inhaled during my shower.

We only hit breakfast once and it was adequate, coffee, fake juice and lots of bagels. About New York. The city is alive, vibrant and in great shape! The people are friendly overly helpful and seem to have a real sense of community after 9/11. We were there right before the 9/11 5th year anniversary remeberances and the city seems to go about it's business more so than the rest of the U.S.. New Yorkers live to live and seem to be more in touch with everyone around them whether they are natives or not. We saw NO homeless people, as a matter of fact I am approached by more panhandlers in the suburbs of central Texas in one morning commute than I was the whole 4 days I was in NYC! Great shows to see: Wicked, Color Purple, and Jersey Boys. A trip to The Rainbow Room atop 30 Rockafeller Center for a view of the city and Empire State Builidng at night are worth the $12 glass of wine....

This was not our first trip to the city but it was one of the more enjoyable hotel experiences we have had. The only reason that we ended up there was that the majority of available rooms in other hotels for that time were either hugely expensive or only had 1 bed. After reading a number of differing reviews I made the choice of this hotel and I am very pleased that we did. To address other reviews, yes it is very quiet at night around the hotel and looks a little scary, but we had no problems at all and felt very safe walking around there. At all times when we passed through the front door of the hotel there was a door man who was very friendly and more than happy to offer helpful advice when we had a question. The location was fantastic, we walked up town to Times Square and beyond and also down to Greenwich Village and China Town and found it to be a very easy and enjoyable walk. There was a subway station nearby with very frequent services that took us anywhere else we wanted to go. The room was very large had 2 double beds and a large bathroom with a bathtub which was very nice after a long day of walking. And the view was amazing, the empire state building felt so close from our window that you could almost touch it! I'm sure not every room has a view like that so ask when you check in. So the airconditoning is a little bit noisey, we were one one of the higher floors so opened the window. The breakfast was a nice touch, we chose to take our breakfast back to the room and ate it enjoying the view, there was no need to sit in the small room with a lot of people walking around you. And having tea and coffee available at all times was really good as well. The thing I liked best about the hotel was how small it was, the staff were very friendly and some of the most helpful I have experienced for a long while. We lost our money in the vending machine and thought that we wouldn't get it back, no problem, just told the person at the front desk and he promptly refunded the money and gave me directions to the nearest convenience store. For those people that are interested in spending their money on designer beds and fancy toiletries, then this might not be the hotel for you, but if you have other things to spend your money on and just want a classic hotel with breakfast and friendly staff then this is probably a good choice.

The good: The Broadway Plaza has great rooms. They're clean, they're comfy, and if you're not a princess you'll be just fine. Think Holiday Inn pre-makeover. Nothing super special, but just fine. The place is small but there's nothing about the rooms to make you cringe. Certainly a better deal than Pennsylvania Hotel where my bathroom looked like something out of a horror film. The workers are generally friendly but there is some slight snappiness at the front desk when they're busy. The bad: The lobby is tiny. Not a big deal, unless you're checking in at the same time as other guests. The elevator can take forever sometimes, since there is only 1 that guests can use. The 'free breakfast' room is pretty overrated. It's more like a lounge in the back of a bank where employees drink a cheap, bad coffee mid-morning and toast bread in a toaster that grandma should have thrown out 5 years ago. The ugly: New York is not a pretty city. You will generally feel unsafe anywhere in the city, especially if you're not used to it. That said, this neighborhood is not touristy whatsoever and if you're not a New Yorker than you're going to feel out of place and possibly weary of your surroundings the first day or two. Do NOT go upstairs at the pizza place next door. There were no seats and we ventured up there only to find drug deals going down all around us. Keep in mind this is New York and it happens anyway - just maybe not as noticeably in other places. If you're going out at night, have the desk guy flag you a car. If you walk straight into the car then there are no issues. If you're in a group, not a huge deal. Nice and affordable hotels are hard to find in NYC and this one isn't horrible, but if you're a first timer and you're not \"street savvy\" do yourself a favor and spend a couple of extra bucks closer to Times Square where the lights are always bright and nothing lurks in the shadows.

We asked if they could swap the room, no they were all booked up. After a long trip we needed some rest this was not a good start to our trip at all. To cut a long story short I used the phone and yellow pages in the room to ring other hotels, got the same rate at Holiday Inn Martinique on Broadway. Checked out later that same night- no refund at Plaza not even the offer of a %. I emailed them on my return not any response from them at all. The Holiday Inn was SUPERB all areas of service quality, surroundings, food, location, customer service etc. They saved the day, the Broadfway Plaza is ok for a basic business stop over without the frills but for a family trip think again. The neighbourhood here can feel intimidating for Manhattan which we find generally safe and at ease in. Richard I felt sorry for he did his best, pity the other staff there did not live up to him.
