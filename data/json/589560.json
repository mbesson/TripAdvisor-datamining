Our first stay was decent. The room is small and furnishings are bare, but it was adequate. Do note that the room does not come with a kettle or tea/coffee making facilities of any sort. Only the bare essentials are provided at Hotel Lucci. We checked out for a night in Florence, and when we came back to Rome for our second stay, we were provided with keys and directions to our room, which turned out to be at their sister hotel, Hotel Des Artistes. On checking out our room at Hotel Des Artistes, it was clear that it was a much cheaper and inferior room than Hotel Lucci. This was confirmed when I checked the internet rates - Hotel Lucci was more expensive than Hotel Des Artistes. Furnishings and lighting at Hotel Des Artistes is also sub-standard. For example, you get a museum-grade CRT TV at Des Artistes and a dark, gloomy room. So, in effect, we had booked and paid for a better room but was provided with an inferior one - all done on the sly without informing us. On explaining this to reception, we were given excuses that Hotel Des Artistes was in fact more expensive and had a better location (we expected this, thanks to a previous review here on Trip Advisor). We persisted and they eventually agreed to provide us with a room at Hotel Lucci as we had requested. To accommodate us (Hotel Lucci was apparently full - strange, considering they accepted our reservation), they mentioned that they bumped out another guest. Other aspects - the lifts are fairly dodgy, breakfast is decent enough for the price you pay, toilets don't flush properly.", "Date": "January 10, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Calgary, Canada", "Title": "\u201cGreat Location in Rome\u201d", "Author": "mexicorvc", "ReviewID": "UR116265610", "Content": "This is a great little hotel.

However upon arrival we were told that we had to pay upfront before even seeing our room, we were given our key and told to go to 4th floor, I said no I didnt pay for this hotel (Hotel Des Artistes which is priced a LOT lower than Lucci Hotel) I paid for the Lucci hotel and the guy started saying its the same difference, how the hotel I was standing in was much better because there was a lift and there is 24 hour reception and how breakfast was here & if I stayed in the Lucci hotel I would have to come over for breakfast etc, I told him I wanted the hotel I paid for but might as well have talked to the wall...I have just looked at the price difference for both hotel des artistes & lucci hotel & there is a major difference, I will be mailing hotel management as by right they owe me a refund..SCAM SCAM SCAM", "Date": "September 4, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Melbourne, Australia", "Title": "\u201cSpacious for the money & good location\u201d", "Author": "NTZ11", "ReviewID": "UR69480102", "Content": "Better than what I was expecting!

It took me a while to write this review but we really enjoyed our stay there. The hotel is very close to the Termini station (about 5 minutes walk), so if you arrive from the airport with the Ryanair shuttle bus, it is very convenient. About 5 minutes after we got off the bus at Termini, we were in our room! People at the front desk were very friendly and showed us our room. They even offered us a bottle of Italian sparkling wine because we were on our honeymoon. The room was small but very nicely decorated and had all the confort one would need. It was an excellent value for the price we paid. Breakfast was included in the price and was served in the nearby hotel \"Hotel des Artistes\". Breakfast was buffet style and really good. All in all, we had a lovely time in Rome and this hotel was an excellent choice for us.
