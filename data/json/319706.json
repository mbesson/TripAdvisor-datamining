There's a small mall about 10 minutes walk away, with a Carrefour supermarket there. The chinese restaurant downstairs is very good.

We usually travel to Dubai every month for 2 nights and I usually stay at the Marriott however this time we opted to stay at the Capitol because a friend of ours lives just a few blocks down the street. We booked 4 rooms and at check in everything went smoothly. The only thing we noticed is that the staff does not know what it means to smile and greet guests\u2026 anyways. The rooms were clean however two of our rooms didn't have warm water in the shower so we had to shower in the rooms with warm water. (One of my friends who\u2019s stayed in this hotel before told me he had the same shower problem the last time so perhaps the hotel should look into their piping system since warm water is not exactly an \"Extra service\u201d). One of the biggest issues we had was when we returned to the hotel in the night. One of the night staff decided it was necessary to follow us all the way to the lift and repeatedly ask \"are you guest\u2019s\" which we all answered yes however he still followed us. He was directing his questions to the females in the group which made us realize he must have thought we were \"working girls\". Now while this issue might be a big problem in Dubai that does not mean the hotel gets to harass their female guests. On the second night all the girls in the group held their room keys in their hands as soon as we left the taxi so that we were not harassed and followed all the way to the lift. If the hotel insists on following guests around perhaps they should print a list with the names of in house guests and make sure that all guests who enter the hotel tell their name and room number (even though this would also be seen as delving into people\u2019s personal lives\u2026it seems better than having a man follow you and repeatedly ask the same question). When I travel I feel that I am paying with my hard earned money and therefore should feel comfortable and safe which I did not therefore, we have decided that another hotel in Dubai deserves our business. The hotel should look at the number of females booking the hotel because I am pretty sure that if their night staff treats all their female guests as they did us I am pretty sure they would notice female bookings are not that high. (I am not sure if our group was a special case...but we were dressed appropriately for the region and behaved in an orderly fashion since I have lived in the middle east for 27 years). While the Marriott might be a little more out of the way from the places we visit in Dubai and costly we decided that we will spend the extra taxi and hotel money in order to feel comfortable rather than being made to feel cheap. (I never had this issue in the Marriott..too bad that the Capitol will be losing out on our monthly visits of at least 4-6 rooms for at least 2 nights).", "Date": "February 14, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "1", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Tehran", "Title": "\u201cPrice is reasonable but it is not 4 star hotel\u201d", "Author": "Mahsa_USA", "ReviewID": "UR123481820", "Content": "We stayed in Capital hotel in Jan 2012 as group of 10 people and although the staffs were polite but they always made many silly mistakes , for example I asked 3 times to send someone fix our bath hot water and during 4 days no body come , hot water in bathroom is not really warm and you can not take shower .

A knock on the door, turned out to be a thai prostitude dressed in black. No doubt send in by the reception. I complained later on, but they looked at me, as if I was mad. Little did I know this of course. I just wanted a cheap room and I got it. A very basic toilet and tv and that is it. Door locks are not secure. So don't dare to leave anything valuable inside. Walls are thin, so you can imagine what you hear. I checked after one night and found the Awal Hotel, about 5 minutes from this. It is slightly more expensive at about bd15 but it was much better and cleaner. The only plus is the low price and the location if you liked being in the very heart of the old town and souk.

We had two rooms, one room had the beautiful brick call to look at with two small windows on either side and the other room had another room to look at.

The guests are all on business so it doesnt make it fun for family. There is no specific hotel evening entertainment, only a couple of bars and a resteraunt which we didnt use at all. the swimming pool is small but fine for a dip, nothing special. while we were out on the roof, we were disrupted by the drilling taking place on the room and all the dust plesantly falling in the pool. If you expect to see other people there then think again, its a dead area on the roof with a shoddy gym facility. The hotel service is fine, but we used the hotel for somewhere to sleep.

Our meals were confined to the buffet breakfast, which was always adequate, and dinner in our room-either lamb cutlets or fish with salad which were always enjoyable.Wine is expensive and the choice limited. The room was large and clean- albeit a little dark having a small window facing an adjacent appartment block-and well maintained.Traffic noise was not a problem. There is internet access in the room with the cost being standard. Although we were some distance from the night-club on the floor below, the noise was a problem on at least two nights during our stay. People staying in rooms closer to the night club had difficulty sleeping. Smoke is a problem throughout the hotel, if you are a non-smoker. Although we were in a non-smoking room, we needed to put towels behind the door to prevent smoke from entering our bedroom at night.For us who were on business, the disco and the smoke were the only problems. We did not use the gym or swimming pool and so cannot comment. However, the pool is very small and un-inviting with cloudy water when we visited. Generally, the staff were very friendly and helpful, although one of the customer service representatives was not only unhelpful, but bordering on rude. However, I prefer to remember the lovely people who served us at breakfast with particular mention of the chef who really tried and succeeded in making our eggs perfect. I also need to mention that the hotel did not charge us for a late check-out at 6pm which is a nice gesture. This is not really a tourist hotel in my view. It's away from the beach and the main shopping malls which are definitely worth visiting.

We arrived early in the morning (6.00am) and the hotel was very accommodating, showing us to our room within half an hour of our arrival, however, the room really smelled of stale smoke. This was not an isolated problem as at least one other couple had the same problem, even though they had pre-booked a non-smoking room. We asked to change rooms and was informed that we could, but not until midday. At midday it seemed there was a problem, with only one room available, I fear this room only smelled sweeter due to the fact it was above the night club and had probably been unoccupied for some time. As I was fortunate enough to have ear plugs with me the noise did not prove a problem. The hotel itself was very clean and the staff most pleasant, the food was OK and on a par with other establishments tried, but disappointing and not as good as Singapore, our last port of call.
