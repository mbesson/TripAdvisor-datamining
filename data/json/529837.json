As other reviews have said, this is a basic hotel (small rooms, basic furnishing, no elevator) but the bed was comfortable, the room clean and the owners very friendly. Unlike some other small hotels like this, the owners don't try to skimp on the small things (good quality toilet paper, 2 bath sheets each, as much food at breakfast as you want and so on). Breakfast was very generous by Italian standards as it included cheese, salami and ham. There was Hero jam, Nutella and generous amounts of butter and most days we could help ourselves from a bowl of fresh fruit. I didn't find the neighbourhood at all unsavoury. Via Bixio is a quiet street with little traffic though pedestrian traffic (with talking) starts early. It's about a 15 walk to the Coliseum and only 2 blocks from the Metro, so the location is good. If you stay here, 2 things to know. One is that if you arrive at Termini Station (the airport train arrives here), take the Giovanni Giolitti exit which is right where the airport train arrives and you'll save yourself a lot of walking. And the 810 bus from right outside the Manzoni Metro station (2 blocks) takes you right to the centre of things past the Coloseum and Forum to Piazza Venezia.", "Date": "November 28, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Dusseldorf, Germany", "Title": "\u201cGood location, basic hotel\u201d", "Author": "Bone007", "ReviewID": "UR118957750", "Content": "The location is good since it is close to some of the major attractions and public transport is easily accessible.

The big part of its unique charm lies in the fact that it is a family run Hotel. Run by owners; Carlo, Lucia, their son Massimiliano, and daughter Margareta. They are very professional and work hard to make sure your stay is pleasant and enjoyable. The rooms are very clean and well maintained. Other hotels may offer better locations and more amenities, but the service and warmth of the staff creates an atmosphere that will leave you feeling at the end of your stay as if you are a member of the family. For example: When my friend became ill, Lucia brought her some juice and bread to her room which helped her a great deal. Its very difficult to get personal attention like that in bigger hotels. Along with a great staff the hotels location is within walking distance to the train station, shopping areas, tourist sites, and many wonderful restaurants that feature typical Roman cuisine.

Please. Just don't. Even if you think you've searched for another cheap, central option in Rome and come up with nothing, I urge you to look again because I can guarantee you that this is the most miserable, disappointing hotel you'll ever have had the misfortune to shell out for. Just a few of the pleasures you can look forward to are a breakfast of stale 'croissants' and radioactive looking 'fruit juice', and the luxury of being woken up nice and early by the elderly owner literally shouting greetings to her guests in lively Italian. Welcome to your relaxing stay in Rome. The only good thing I have to say about it was that the rooms were clean and the owner's son? grandson? was helpful. The main issue I have is that, for 90 euro a night, I expected at least hot water and the double bed that we had booked. We got neither. At the very least I wouldn't have anticipated the raging rant that we were subject to from the owner when we complained at the lack of hot water and suggested a reduction in our rate.

It is run by a family who takes special care of you, from the moment you arrive. Neither speaks English, but they communicate very well. Their son speaks many languages, and conducts much of the business part, offering assistance even before you get there. Each morning you are greeted by breakfast in the lower level common room. You have a rolls, a slice of cheese, slice of salumi, butter, jams, a small sweet roll if you wish, and freshly made coffee and steamed milk. Mama holds court, and seats you with people who speak your language if possible. Nice start to the day. If you ask about a certain site, you'll get a map with drawn directions, including bus or tram numbers. You are equidistant between Vittorio Emanuele and Manzoni stops on the metro, just a 4 minute ride from Termini. It is described to be in the Termini area, and I guess it is, but not close to the main entrance. It's within walking distance to the Colloseum, San Giovanni Laterno, and really near all kinds of transportation. My room was small and spartan, but I had all I needed, including a TV with local channels. I had a private bath, dresser, closet, phone, and a place for luggage. I also had the only room with a small balcony which was nice to keep wine and soda on in Feb. The rooms are cleaned every day, and the sheets were clean and crisp. If you are of the school that believes you spend most of your time in your room with your eyes closed, this is place could be for you. I booked first on Venere.com, then found a better price on Priceline. Finally, the best price was on their website, and they promptly verified that rate by email. The only caution is that you should check the floor you are on. The building has three rooms on each of three floors, and you should be in good shape if you have a top floor room (and don't forget anything you have to go back for). Over breakfast conversation, other guests and I noted the neighborhood looks dicier than it actually is. I walked around the area on my own every evening, and had absolutely no problems. It is an area in change, and now many asian stores and signs. It is very close to the Vittorio Emanuele market, which has moved from the park to 2 covered buildings a block away. Talk about a trip around the world! As you leave the hotel, you turn in your heavy key and fob, and you get it back when you return and ring the bell. And what a treat I had every night, taking the metro to Vittorio Emanuele stop and on the way back finding the famous gelateria \"Fassi\" literally right around the corner from home! The gelato is great, and try the truffle! \"Papa\" usually has night duty, and when opening the door for me was concerned when he did not see the usual cone (and it wasn't Monday, when Fassi is closed). I pulled the cup of truffle from my bag, and all was right with the world.", "Date": "April 19, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "4", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Germany", "Title": "\u201cFeels like home\u201d", "Author": "ccro", "ReviewID": "UR4359650", "Content": "My husband and I thoroughly enjoyed our stay at the Lussemburgo. The family that owns the hotel is wonderful. So very kind, friendly and inviting. The son was very helpful and speaks very good English. The mom and dad speak very little, but are still able to communicate and get the point across. The son gave us a map to the city and circled all of the wonderful places to see, which also included an explanation on the best and easiest way to get there. We brought the incorrect adapter for the plugs, and the family provided us with the right one. They went out of their way to make sure our stay was a good one. Check out was at 11 am, and our flight didn't leave until 10 pm that night. It was not a problem for us to keep our luggage in the lobby. They even made sure it was taken care of while we were out. The rooms are small and basic, but that is to be expected when traveling in Europe. We didn't travel to Rome to stay inside all day anyway, so the rooms were just fine for us. The hotel does not have a lift, but 3 flights of stairs get you to the top. The location is great. A 15 minute walk gets you to the Colosseum and surrounding monuments. You are about two blocks away from the Line A Metro stop and about a 10-15 minute walk from the main train station, Termini. If you take line A from Termini to Manzoni, it's easier on the feet to get to the hotel. Overall, Rome was fantastic and our stay couldn't have been any better. We truly believe that our trip was so great partly due to the fact that we felt as if we had been invited to stay in someone's home.
