Our double room could be considered on the small side but it was absolutely perfect for somewhere to crash out. Rooms in Parisian hotels are famed for being petite just as they like to cram as many people into bars, restaurants etc. Breakfast is a continental buffet which was more than sufficient. Again don't expect a full hot buffet with all the trimmings, most hotels in Paris will offer fresh pastries, hams, cheeses etc. Only down side was the lack of aircon which meant our room was hot at night and the fact that the lift broke on our penultimate night (we were on the 6th floor!).

It is a smallish hotel off the main drags (Rue Brey is an alleyway), but really close to the Etoile Metro, and all the shops surrounding the Arc de Triomphe. Check-in was a breeze, but initially we were assigned a room on the ground floor, which was very dissapointing, it had lots of road noise and pedestrian traffic right outside the window. We politely complained in our halting Canadian civil service French and were reassigned the next day into a room on the 6th floor (top floor, room 64) which had *two* balconies, (only big enough to stand on, no chairs or tables could ever fit), which was fantastic! (Thanks again, Sylwain, you're the best, you totally rescued our honeymoon!!!) The view was of Paris rooftops, and you can't see much in the way of landmarks, but was really beautiful all the same. The room was cozy, modern, well lit, clean (save for a tiny touch of ceiling mold here and there in the washroom, but nothing out of the ordinary for an 150-year old building), and the A/C worked flawlessly. There is no bathroom fan, and the only dressing mirror was in the bathroom - though this is not the same for each room, our first room on the ground floor had a dressing mirror outside, which is better. This was something which annoyed my wife to no end, but didn't even register with me. The heated towel racks were a nice touch, but the shower \"curtain\" is a swinging piece of glass over a very deep tub which was IMHO style over safety, I could see ingress/egress of the shower could be a bit of a problem for Grandma and Grandpa, but we didn't have any specific issues there. The hotel serves a modest all-you-can-eat continental breakfast downstairs in a pretty buffet room consisting of toast, croissants, meats, fresh cheese, fruit juice and yogurt. 15 \u20ac is a bit pricey, but you can't beat the service, the food is great, and there is the signifigant convenience factor to start your day. There isn't a lot of equivalent breakfast places on Brey within a one-block radius, aside from a couple of fast food places on Wagram, so I really reccomend eating at the Hotel. Then again, there is a Metroprix (basically an upscale Target/Walmart/Zellers) down the street a block, you could stock up on food there, but where is the romance in that? :-) We initially took the Metro from CDG airport all the way to Ternes, with bags, amd due to all the turnstiles and stairs, that method is *not* recommended. We took an airport shuttle from the hotel out to CDG for less than \u20ac30, and that was by far the best route. All in all we were very pleased with the hotel and would stay there again (maybe for our 20th :-) ), and totally reccomend the place.

The airport shuttle service to the airport, was advertised as being 15 euro, but when we arrived we got a shock that it was just a booking fee?

The first thing I noticed about this hotel was the ideal location. It was 5 minute walk to the the Champs Elyees where theres a Metro station and numerous shops restaurants and typical french cafes. Checking in / out was very simple and all members of staff were incredibly helpful and willing to do whatever they could to ensure you had an enjoyable stay. Whilst I was there the staff willingly made us reservations at restaurants, ordered us taxis, helped us with directions and recommended places for us to go. Also, as it was my 21st, my parents contacted the hotel to organise a surprise bottle of champagne to be sent to my room. The hotel made this really easy for my parents to organise and went to the trouble of trying to find out my plans for the day so that they new the perfect time to bring up the champagne. The staff definately went that extra step to connect with those staying with them on a personal level, and undoubtedly contributed to making my trip memorable. To follow, being three 20/21 year old girls, we were hoping for a spacious room to get ready in everyday and not to be on top of eachother. Our room in this hotel catered for this exact need. We had three single beds which a large floor space in the centre, a table, three chairs, a large wardobe, a desk, bedside lamps and tables and a flat screen TV. We then had a large bathroom with a powerful shower and a seperate toilet room. Our room was beautifully decorated and one thing I noticed straight away was how clean it was. The maids cleaned the rooms everyday and provided us each with clean towels each day. The hotel was small and quiet, which we found to be ideal when having a tiring day out exploring the sites of Paris. There was a computer in reception with internet which all guests were welcome to use free of charge at their leisure. There was also a bar which, although we didnt use, looked to have a wide variety or drinks available. Although we didnt have breaksfast during our stay at the hotel, the breakfast room was located downstairs and looked very spacious and well docorated in line with the overall theme of the hotel. Overall, I would strongly recommend this hotel for all types of guests as the staff really do do whatever they can to cater to your needs.

We chose the Superior Room, since it was larger than the standard and we found it to be quite comfortable.

We flew in from Singapore and took the Air France bus to the hotel. It was a short (4 minutes or thereabouts) walk to the hotel from the Air France bus stop. The Tilsitt's location is ace - near to the Charles de Gaulle main station and the Ternes station, so you get a choice of various different metro lines. There is also a Monoprix round the corner where you can get groceries (water, chocolates, sandwiches etc) so that's very convenient. There are a lot of good food and decent cafes in the vicinity. The hotel is a couple of minutes' walk to the Arc de Triomphe and the Champs and my husband and I had after-dinner strolls along the Champs. Yes, the rooms are rather small but I reckon that's quite normal for Parisienne hotels in this price bracket. Although small, the rooms are comfortable and clean. Oh, and the toiletries are lovely. The walls are thin, our room was near the lift and from time to time we could hear some sounds from the lift but nothing too distubring and nothing that kept us awake. I thought the pillows were a little to thin (flat?) for my liking but I reckon this aspect would vary from person to person. I didn't try the breakfast so can't comment on that. The hotel smells lovely. Manuel keeps the place wonderfully charming with nice scented candles (these are unique, good-quality Tilsitt Hotel candles and you should consider getting one of them, I bought 4) and warm lighting in the lobby. All these make returning to the hotel after a long day out a very welcome and pleasant experience - kinda like stumbling home to a warm, cosy and nice-smelling living room after a tiring day out. The staff in the hotel are very nice. Manuel particularly is brilliant - very helpful and always smiling. We had a very nice chat about candles and other scented stuff we love and I realised he had stayed past his working hours (about 45 minutes past) to chat with me and introduce me to some lovely French-made candles. I think that speaks volumes about the people at this hotel and the lengths they will go to to make their guests feel at home.

I think ours was one of the smaller rooms in the hotel, and at times we felt a little cramped. But it was clean and comfortable and had doors that opened onto our own private patio area. One of my favorite things during our stay was the room service. On several occasions, we called to have coffee brought to our room. Within just a few minutes, there would be a soft knock on the door and one of the staff would have a tray of probably the best coffee we had during our stay in Paris. Not only that, but they heated the milk so that it wouldn't cool our coffee down when we mixed it. That kind of attention to detail was one of the reasons we liked this hotel so well. All of the staff was so very friendly and helpful and gave us a personalized attention that we were definitely not used to from our travels elsewhere. We are especially thankful to Manuel at the front desk. He always took whatever time or effort that was necessary to help us get around. Whether helping with our French, explaining the Metro, recommending a restaurant or just giving us some excellent tips and direction.

The breakfast in the basement was fine, but was not included in the room price. I think Valadon's location was better as well. It is located in an interesting area of Paris with a market street (Rue Cler) one block away. The Tilsitt is located near the Eiffel Tower and Champs Elysees, which is nice if those are your main interests. It also means the area is fairly busy with tourists which can be annoying.

We were allocated room 76 which was on the ground floor directly opposite the reception and next to the office and luggage racks. first impressions were not good as we thought it would be very noisy. On entering the room it was quite dark and depressing looking but the upside was it had doors that led to a small courtyard with a table and chairs where you could sit and relax if you wanted to. The room had a double bed and although it wasnt a big room I wouldnt class it as tiny. The bed was excellent and so comfortable we slept soundly every night and we were not disturbed by any noise as previously anticipated. The room had lots of lamps and once these were switched on the room took on a different amosphere and looked great. the bathroom although small and compact had an excellent shower with lost of continious hot water and the towels were changed every day. We didnt have breakfast at the hotel so canott comment on this instead we opted to go out for breakfast to \"Pauls\" patisserie and another coffee shop in the market area 5 mins away - both were fab. The staff at the hotel were very pleasant and helpful and Manual recommended a great bistro called \"Kobas\" at \"Le Hide\" a few streets away typical parisien and it was fab!!!! Staff also organised the Paris shuttle back to the airport for us and it was prompt and delivered us in plenty of time-would definately reccommend this service it was 20 Euros each - can be booked on line prior at 18 euros via Easy Jet Website.

While we only had 2 full days to visit, Paris certainly lived up to its world class reputation and provided a memorable experience for our family.

The hotel is located on a small side street within minutes walk from Arc de Triomphe located at Charles De Gaulle Etoile, a huge round-about where over 10 streets come together, including Avenue des Champs-Elysees. If you are driving, as we were, the parking on Rue Brey and Rue Troyon is free for August (if you\u2019re fortunate enough to find an empty spot), otherwise there is a parking garage nearby on Avenue de Wagram which charges 25 euros per day. There are a couple of small supermarkets very close by for getting any amenities (including beer and wine). The rooms, including the bathrooms, are somewhat small, but are clean and the beds comfortable. Unfortunately our first night we discovered the air conditioner in the room was not working properly and the room was uncomfortably warm, but we were too exhausted to change rooms at that point so instead opened the window to get some outside air. While Rue Brey is relatively quiet, there was still enough outside noises to be a distraction and the first night was not very restful. Fortunately the next morning the hotel had an available room in which the a/c was operating properly, and to make up for the trouble and inconvenience did not charge us for breakfast that day. The front desk staff was friendly and helpful and the hotel provided a comfortable stay at a good value (3 nights for the price of two) and a convenient location from which to explore and experience this amazing city.

However, I am sorry to say but the sight of the hotel and then the room is a little disappointing. Given it's location, exceptional service, clean and tidy rooms and an overall inviting friendly atmosphere, this place is definitely worth recommending. But I think it is also important that the expectations be set right. The hotel is a tiny property clubbed with several other identical looking hotels in an alley near Champs Elysees. The roms are just big enough to accomodate two beds and a couple of suitcases. The 'sit-out' is really a two feet by 4 feet extension which can agt best be called an 'opening', looking into other buildings. Even the photo shop across the street had not heard of the hotel. Much that I was impressed with the staff and the set-up, this is just another hotel in my mind. I could not get booking for another day's stay and had to check into the Concorde La Fayette. While the service may not be as personalized etc etc, the rooms are of a different league. And when you get the Concorde for the same price as Tilsitt, I would definitely pick the former, if only because I like spreading my legs and watching the Eiffel from the 20th floor while I sip my wine.

Everyone from the Receptionists to the very nice man who poured our drinks at night made our stay an exceptionally pleasant experience. Just walk out the door of the hotel and the Arc de Triomph is within view in a few minutes. The metro stations are within 5 minutes walk from the hotel. The open top tour bus can be taken nearby. The Champs Elysees is readily available for those who wish to shop. Don't bypass this hotel if you intend to stay in Paris. Oh by the way it is very reasonable also - wont break the bank.

We were pleasantly surprised by the interior. The reception room leads to the bar lounge area, which is very nicely decorated. Although we rarely saw a bar tender present. The lift is very small so bear this in mind if you have lots of luggage. We only stayed a night so it wasn't a problem. If you walk down the stairs, you'll notice the hard wood floors on the ground floor. Really lovely. The room itself, we stayed on the second floor. Judging by the fire escape floor plan, we had the biggest room on the floor. It's not massive but big enough to walk around. There is a small flat screen TV attached to the wall. A desk and chair; a closet with safe and mini bar fridge, extra blankets. The bed was well made with mint chocolates on the cushions. We had a balcony overlooking the street, lovely although a little noisy at times. The bathroom was clean. A hairdryer is attached to the wall. It can get a little noisy in the mornings as you can hear people upstairs talking and walking around. The road is quite quiet apart from the odd moped going by noisily, but not really a major problem. There is free wifi in the lobby area. And a free PC to use if you don't have your own laptop. Alternatively you can buy a Wifi card fo use it in your room. The area was great! There are so many restaurants to choose from in the area. There are also retail shops nearby, such as Gap, NAFNAF, Habitat. We had a hard time choosing where to eat. Don't bother with the Thai place though, we were very disappointed with it! There is also a BNP Paribas bank nearby to withdraw money. And it's a 5 minute walk to the Charles de Gaulles metro station. This is a well placed hotel, very reasonably priced. We walked to the Louvre, which was about 2 miles away! The Eiffel Tower is just across the Seine. It has everything you need. There is a nearby crepe cafe or a bakery if you miss breakfast.

There was a safe in the room and a shower with great hot water. Our room overlooked 2 different courtyards and the view was pleasant. The bed was awesome - not a backache one single night! As previously stated, there is a grocery store 1/2 block away, with basic supplies. Plus there is a market just 2-3blocks north on Rue Poncelet each morning with deli meats, bakers, pastries, coffee, fresh produce, cheese etc. We got breakfast here each morning and enjoyed an eclair from Stubli (an awesome pastry shop) while watching this neighborhood market function. We also got our lunches here, bread and meat and cheese for our day and ate in one of Paris' awesome parks (our favorite is Luxembourg) The staff were great - always friendly and helpful, even volunteering to print my boarding passes for me - thanks Manuel! The wireless internet is free on your pc or theirs in the lobby, so we used it there, rather than paying in our room. We really liked the location too - just 2-3 blocks from one of the main metro connection spots in the city, yet still on the edge of a residential area - so we slept every night with our windows open and it was quiet enough to sleep.

Some nice decor touches also (and flat screen TV on the wall). So many hotels just barely 'qualify' for their star rating (usually on something ridiculous like the number of credit cards they accept) but this qualifies on a comfort rating alone. Breakfast room small as expected yet airy and roomy, and service very prompt. Everyone in the hotel - every single person on reception desk plus breakfast room staff and cleaning staff - was very friendly. Checking in and out very efficient. I had booked on the basis of other reviews on TripAdvisor and would agree with the other comments. The location is good for anyone who doesn't want to travel by underground to find a place to eat in the evenings - there are lots of restaurants in the vicinity of the hotel, suiting all budgets.

There has never been a problem until now. The hotel is in a great location, a minute from the Arc de Triomphe and a 25 min walk from the Eiffel Tower. It's 3 star, but like a British 2 star. All the staff were lovely apart from one, who i shall discuss with you now! We arrived at midnight from London and went straight to bed. I woke up in the morning to find some red bumps on my hand. By the end of the day i had about 80 bites all over my arms (horrendous huge bites) and a few on my legs and feet. i had clearly been bitten overnight in our room as i woke up with this problem and had been covered up all day as it was a cold overcast day in Paris. that night i asked the receptionist if we could change room. she said no as the hotel was fully booked. i then asked her if she could at least change the bed linen, and she said no as she was the only one on duty! i showed her my bites and she very coldly told me i was probably allergic to my jumper (!?) even though there were bite marks all over me and i've had my jumper for years! she scowled at me when she looked at the bites, offered me no medical help and said this had never happened at the hotel before! the next day i spoke to another receptionist who was much nicer and helpful. he changed our room. when we checked out we found out we were still being charged for a superior room and i had to beg to get 35 Euros off just to be charged the right rate for our room which was ridiculous. other things to note about this hotel. our first morning we went out for breakfast and popped back and found our room was open and was being cleaned (our room was by the reception and bar area). we sat there for 10 minutes and the cleaning lady did not return! anyone could have walked in the room and taken things and who knows how long she was gone for! this is the first time i have ever stayed at a hotel and would say dont go back there. i have no idea what other trip advisor reviewers are writing about, i dont have very high standards so for me to be this critical means something, trust me. we got a superior room (waste of money, still poor quality just more of it!) and the ceilings were so badly done you could see the insulation coming through, i've attached a few pics. All in all this place is worth avoiding. there are loads of hotels in the area, including some chains, given how badly i was bitten i would recommend stearing clear. Aside from this Paris was amazing and here are some tips: - If you fly into Charles de Gaulle the last train into Paris is at 11.56pm. if you miss this like us you'll get stuck with a 70/80 Euro cab journey. the train costs 8 euros but none of the ticket machines take credit cards or euro notes so you must have change for them (there were no open ticket offices and no machines which change notes into coins either). - We got the 'Open Tours' 3 day Paris ticket, great value. you can get unlimited boats to 8 destinations and buses to over 60 (There are 4 different routes). we got the buses everywhere, and they saved us a fortune in travel. - we went to the Louvre at 4pm on the Friday and there was no queue and we walked straight up to the Mona Lisa, no queueing again, i think late in the day and possibly avoiding the weekend is the best time to go, enjoy Paris, but avoid this hotel like the plague!", "Date": "September 11, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Fife, Scotland", "Title": "\u201cExcellent Hotel, Perfect Central Location, Did Not Disappoint\u201d", "Author": "harveyFife_Scotland", "ReviewID": "UR8671431", "Content": "I have just returned from Paris after spending 3 nights at Tilsett Etoile.

The Charles De Gaulle metro station is just a few minutes walk away.", "Date": "July 16, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "4", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "southampton", "Title": "\u201cHotel we always choose when visiting Paris\u201d", "Author": "hersoton", "ReviewID": "UR8118259", "Content": "My sister and I travel to Paris most years, and have always chosen to stay at the Tilsitt ever since it was recommended to us by a travel agent about ten years ago. We are always made to feel extremely welcome, and the rooms (although small in true Parisienne style) are always comfortable and well presented, with everything you need. The mini bar contains soft drinks and reasonably priced cold beer. New additions in our room this year were flat screen TV (multichannel although only BBC World and one sport channel in English), and excellent power showers. We used opt for the buffet breakfast which offers a reasonable choice although is arguably overpriced at 12 euros - but increasingly we tend to just pick up a croissant and coffee in a nearby cafe after we head out for the day. Teatrays are not in all the rooms, but are available on request. Bring your own coffee and milk (and tea bags if you like your tea anything other than very weak), but even having the kettle and mugs is really handy, and an excellent and unusual bonus in France! Its location, in a quiet street but just five minutes walk from the Arc de Triomphe and the neighbouring Charles de Gaule metro/RER station, is perfect. It's also just a ten minute walk from the Champs Elysees. If you can't be bothered to walk/ride too far to eat, (especially the evening you arrive) we recommend Chez Clement which is open till aroun midnight and has about ten branches across Paris. It has eccentric French country house decor and excellent food (duck rotisierre with mash is a personal favourite). There is a branch just a couple of minutes walk from the hotel in Avenue Wagram (turn left out of the top end of Rue Brey and you will find it on your left after a minutes walk). For that essential glass of vin blanc or vin rouge there is a huge choice of pavement bars and cafes in nearby streets, but our favourite drinking location (an easy 10- 15 minutes walk away), is the 33rd floor bar at the top of the Concorde Hotel, 3, Place du G\u00e9n\u00e9ral Koenig, which has the most spectacular views over Paris. If you can time your visit to coincide with sunset so much the better. Drinks are NOT cheap, but with this view just drink slowly and enjoy!! Finally further afield our other favourite Parisienne haunt is the Resurant Grand Colbert, 2 rue Vivienne, which takes you back into the 'Belle Epoque' ambience of the early twentieth century as well as offering excellent food at a good price. Definitely a great location for a special occasion dinner.", "Date": "July 14, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Wakefield", "Title": "\u201cSuperb\u201d", "Author": "geebes2", "ReviewID": "UR8092961", "Content": "Lovely hotel situated very near to the Arc De Triomphe.

I can only repeat after the other guests: rooms are very clean (we had one on the 5th floor), bathroom spotless, breakfast plentiful, metro 5 minutes away, neighborhood quiet, the bus stop for the CDG airport in a walking distance... And of course the staff is really very friendly. Special thanks and best regards to Manuel at the reception desk!
