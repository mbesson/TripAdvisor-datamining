The hotel is also on the door step of Chinatown and Paddy's Markets with easy access (walk or bus) to all the other attractions, sites and shopping that Sydney has to offer. The hotel is apparently heritage listed which is evident with much of the period features and original character remaining. A facelift with a splash of colour and perhaps a change to some of the interior decor, fixtures and fittings would provide the Grande touch an old lady deserves. The rooms are quite small, dated and could do with a lick of paint where bags and furniture have scared the walls. The carpet is nearing the end of its life and attention to detail in the housekeeping, particularly the bathroom where mould is evident in some of the tile grouting and base of the glass shower screen. The shower recess is very tight so watch the elbows and hands. Our bed was a king (two singles pushed together) which was reasonably comfortable. The air conditioning worked, the TV (an old style flat screen) functioned correctly the bar fridge kept our drinks cold, the kettle boiled and was clean and there was an iron and ironing board. Compact but satisfactory. Oh! don't expect a view of the Opera House or Harbor Bridge...we had a view to the overhead of diners down stairs, a brick wall and external walkway. Overall there is nothing wrong with this hotel. Reasonably clean, friendly front of house staff, and small but adequate rooms. A respectable 3 star hotel with an affordable tariff by Sydney accommodation standards. As a house guest I did find the $2.00 per bag/day storage fee a little unreasonable but with no where else to store bags while waiting for your room on check in or late departures from the city...you don't have much choice.", "Date": "April 22, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "sedbergh", "Title": "\u201ccentral good value location\u201d", "Author": "castlehawking0708", "ReviewID": "UR128258599", "Content": "We found this on laterooms at a very good price for the 2 nights we needed between flying in from Brisbane and leaving for Heathrow.

The hotel was an easy walk from Central Station and easy to spot. Although we were checking in at about 9am, our room was ready and we were able to go straight in. The room was basic but considering we only needed it for sleeping it wasn't an issue. We had a room facing the inner courtyard, and noticed a door to allow it to be connecting room. The Great Southern is definitely in the perfect location for not only exploring the markets (there's a back entrance that comes out almost opposite the Paddy Market entrance) but Sydney itself as its location on George Street provides plenty of options in sights, eateries and shopping within a short walk. The bar within the Great Southern also had well priced drinks and delicious pizzas on our last visit to Sydney (we stayed elsewhere during that trip) Upon returning to the hotel in the evening, we tried to use the internet kiosks in the lobby which unfortunately froze with personal accounts open. As we didn't have an Australian phone we tried asking the gentleman on the front desk if we could use their phone to call the company. He was very reluctant to help us, even to use the phone and although the problem did eventually get fixed, we were disappointed with his attitude. The beds were comfortable and we settled in for a LONG sleep after a busy day. Then, just after 5am, we were woken up by all the noise coming from the connecting room. Yelling and throwing items not only in the room but the hallway too. Although it was over quickly, it did impact our overall experience.

We did not dine in the restaurant or purchase the breakfast offers available at reception. This is a listed heritage hotel which may not appeal to all ages. A slight criticism would be stains in carpets which detracted somewhat, a minor criticism in the overall scheme of things. Night reception lady was efficient, polite & helpful. Check-out staff at 1000 very busy & some delay of 10-15 minutes should be expected. Having the option of a shower/bath was a real plus after a long day of rail travel.

The location of this hotel is good but not very special. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s true that it is short distance from the Central Station and only a short walk to Paddy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s market or Chinatown. But to some of the other more notable attractions such as the Opera House, Botanic Gardens or Harbour Bridge, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a long way to walk. Luckily trains and buses are just a stone's throw away. To save us some money we booked, the so called \u00e2\u20ac\u0153No Housekeeping\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd room. It only means that housekeeping people will not enter your room (to make your bed and clean your room) but fresh towels and amenities can be collected anytime from hotel\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s reception if needed. Any dirty towels, rubbish bags can be left outside your room for collection between 9am- 2pm. If you change your mind about the housekeeping service it will cost you $20.oo per day. The no housekeeping option is a great idea. Our room was on the 3rd floor. It was basic. It wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t spacious (rather small) but was spotless. (The whole hotel was clean and well maintained I must say.) We had no view from the window. The window was facing a wall but it was better than the room we were allotted first. The first room we were allocated was on the 5th floor and had no window. A seasoned traveller I knew that we would have problems with the room. Since we travel often to Sydney I know that not all the rooms have windows so I specifically requested a window in our room when we booked as I suffer from claustrophobia. To my horror we got allotted the room without a window. It was solid brick all around. We went back to the reception to complain and to my horror the two receptionists tried to tell me that what we saw was not a wall but a curtain. So we went back to the room to check and not to our surprise it was still a big wall. Anyways, luckily someone from management told the receptionist to give us better room and we were put in the 3rd floor room with a window. This room had a TV but with limited TV channels. No digital channels and only paid movies available. Air-conditioning was programmed to 20 degrees and nothing could be done to change the temperature. The unit was a bit noisy but not too annoying. Our bed was comfortable. We had 2 sets of pillows to choose from (two soft and 2 harder ones). The little en-suit was very clean with nice white, thick and fluffy towels. To finish- WARNING the rooms are small and avoid room 517 if you claustrophobic. Furthermore, they charge for luggage holding. It is $2 per piece which is not expensive but I think it is a bit of a rip- off especially if it is for a few hours. This service should be free for hotel guests.

The coffee is appalling. On the second morning we tried the \"Great Sanger\", please don't repeat our error.

Excellent location, clean and tidy room and friendly service. The room was a little small, but was clean, had relatively new furnishings, and a great view over Sydney. They offer a room service minibar, for very reasonable prices. The hotel contains an internet terminal in reception, a business centre, a small gym (for a $10 fee), and a laundry. In-room broadband access is available for a fee. We received fantastic service from the moment we walked in - we arrived at 9am, and they waived the $2 baggage storage fee. We used this facility again several days after checking out - we travelled into the Blue Mountains for a few days, but had a day to spare in Sydney before catching our 9pm train back home, and the Great Southern Hotel looked after our bags for us for $4 for the day, even though we were no longer guests (thanks Tom & Julian). Here's why we were grateful: there is no luggage storage available in Central Station, and there are few opportunities for baggage storage in the CBD. We were quoted between $16 and $33 per bag per day in other places we contacted, so this really was a fantastic service. The breakfast was great - we got a special when booking through Qantas.com that included breakfast in our room price. The breakfast is $18 each otherwise, and is the standard buffet fare of full English, pancakes, cereal, fruit and toast. There is a pub attached to the hotel (which wasn't noisy at all) that offers lunch and dinner. We paid about $150 a night, which is pretty good for central Sydney, and especially good value during the busy Christmas/New Year period. This hotel would be perfect for business travellers, with the great location and breakfast. There's been a couple of reviews complaining about the distance the hotel is from Central Station - it really is only about 100m at most. The signage in Central Station was a little confusing - in pointing us to George St, it took us the long way around to the hotel. If you come out the front of the station (ie, directly opposite the country platforms) and look left (up Eddy Ave), you will see the facade of the hotel. The hotel is also close to the light rail, which can take you straight into Darling Harbour and to The Star. There is also a Free CBD Shuttle, which provides easy access to Circular Quay, operating out of the bus stands in Eddy Ave.", "Date": "January 2, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "2", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Melbourne, Australia", "Title": "\u201cConveniently Located in Sydney CBD\u201d", "Author": "AussieTraveller_114", "ReviewID": "UR122216614", "Content": "The Great Southern Hotel is conveniently located in Sydney CBD. A 5 minute walk from Central Station, less than 10 minute ride by train from Sydney airport. The Great Southern is within walking distance to Paddy's Market (100m) and China Town (200m). Beyond that, there is easy access to great restaurants and shopping. I arrived at The Great Southern on Christmas Day with my partner. We stayed a total of three nights. During this time, staffing was at an absolute minimum. There was no room service during this holiday period, so our two small rubbish bins were overflowing by the second day, and we ran out of toilet paper. However, when we requested more toilet paper and fresh towels at reception, the staff were more than obliging. The trade off for the convenience of location would probably be the small room and noise. We were staying next to a room of noisy neighbours who talked and giggled into the early hours of the morning. The paper thin walls meant that even the opening and closing of drawers could be clearly heard, resulting in poor sleep for me and my partner. When I reserved the hotel online, there was no breakfast included in the price of the room. The room had to be paid in full and was not refundable. When we arrived at the hotel, there were many posters and advertising of the breakfast options, both around the hotel and in the room. Option A was the buffet breakfast for $19 p.p. and Option B was The Great Sanger (a sandwich with egg, bacon, sausage, hash brown, cheese and tomato sauce) with either a coffee or a juice for $8. Since I am not a big eater, Option B seemed like a reasonable choice, and well priced as well. Breakfast tickets could be purchased at reception the day before, and handed to the waiter in the morning. We bought two tickets for The Great Sanger on the first night and headed downstairs to the restaurant for breakfast on the second day. Upon handing in our tickets, we were informed that The Great Sanger was a takeaway option only (later we realised that it was stated in the fine print on the posters, but it was not mentioned at reception when we purchased our tickets). We were handed two paper cups and our sandwiches in styrofoam packaging, which frankly seemed like a waste of packaging since the restaurant was mostly empty when we arrived. We headed back up to our room to enjoy our takeaway breakfast, which was surprisingly good and filling. Check out time is 10am, and on our final day in Sydney our flight wasn't until after 4pm. The Great Southern has a bag holding service for $2 per item which we took advantage of. Overall, our stay at The Great Southern was quite pleasant. The price of the room varied night to night, but for the three day total, the cost was very reasonable for the peak holiday period. I would recommend The Great Southern to anyone on a budget who doesn't want to stay in a backpacker hostel or if you don't have a car to get around.", "Date": "December 29, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Albury, Australia", "Title": "\u201cVery good Southern Hotel\u201d", "Author": "Dispirit", "ReviewID": "UR122011680", "Content": "Come for the location and stay for the location.

We found the hotel to be clean, the beds were comfortable and the location was brilliant for us as we did not mind the walk to Darling Harbour or the Circluar Quay to see the sites. Our room was on the 4th floor and very mostly quiet except when the bins were emptied at 4 am two mornings (this was to be expected as the room was at the back of the hotel and overlooked Paddy's Market and the Chinese quarter resturant). We mostly ate out but on two occasions we used the hotel facilities in the evening and found the food to be very acceptable and good value. The bathroom was small but adequate and toiletries replaced regularly, there was only 2 small towels provided, but we were able to obtain more from reception, but the cleaners always only ever left us with two until I left them a note! The room was small, which was OK, but there was not enough drawer space or enough hangers in the wardrobe for our stay or bedside lamps, only spot lights in the ceiling. There was a stand for suitcases which we did not use as it would have been in the way. The room had a safe for which there was a charge as was internet use for our laptop. I was dissapointed that although we had pre-paid for the hotel, we were not told fully about the 50 dollar bond and came back one night to find both our room cards de-activated. We were paying for internet use and the safe and as this had gone over the 50 dollar max I had to pay for what we had used already and then pay the remainder when we checked out. I was taken aback as in our previous hotel (4 star) we had not pre-paid, but did not have to settle up until we were checking out , I was just asked for my card details.

The hotel was easy enough to find, being a 10 minute walk from Central train station to George Street. The entrance to the hotel is next to the bar. Upon walking into reception, I was impressed by the art deco features and age of the building. Upon checking in I was promptly asked for my I.D. and either a $50 deposit or a credit card. I showed my I.D. document, which was checked and then scanned on a little black scanner I noticed.... the bloke checking us in did not tell me that my I.D. document would be scanned (or so it looked like to me.....should I be worried ?????) and he then just handed my I.D. document back to me and gave over the keycards to my room. The keycards are required to operate the lift, as well as access your allocated room for the duration of any stay. The room was comfortable, but THE BEDS WERE LIKE CONCRETE. I was starting to wonder that by the end of my stay that I might require the services of a chiropractor... urgently....The walls of the room were paper thin, although where the room was located inside the hotel, thankfully did not hear any traffic noise from the 4 lane road outside... Bathroom was a nice size with a decent sized shower/bath. The only problem was that there was nowhere to put PJ's or other items...the only ledge in the whole bathroom was above the sink and was still not really wide enough to fit vanity bag or other items. The only bathroom freebies were 2 random bottles of shampoo (no conditioner) and a shower cap. No soap. Also provided were towel/face flannel. The air conditioner in the room leaked on one occassion, but rang down to reception who sent someone up very promptly with some towels. I found that temperature in the room could not be adjusted and was stuck on 20 degrees. The air conditioner at night was a bit noisy but not too terrible. Overall this hotel was good, but would not rate this hotel at 4 star NO WAY !!! More like 3 star.

Their staff recited their policy as I had expected. A couple of hours later however, Donald from GSH called me to tell me that a refund or change of dates was on the way. This is fantastic service.

This hotel is on George street which is one of the main streets in Sydney and stretches for miles. Its within walking distance to the Central station, Darling Harbour and Paddy's market. Travel is close by. Internet if needed is also close. It depends what you want to do with your time here. For me, I wanted to get out and about and got the weekly pass for 57 dollars and did just that. You can get either a train from Central to Circular quay but id say get the ferry from Darling Harbour. Its the first time that ive been and as the ferry past around the corner I saw the Sydney bridge and also the Opera house. Circular quay is central to any travelling that you want to make be it to Manly Beach, Taronga Zoo or somewhere else. id also recommend to go and see Blue Mountains and make sure you get in touch with Skydive the beach in Sydney - truly amazing. Anyway back to the hotel. The rooms are either facing the building or facing the street. I switched rooms from a quiet one facing the building, but in darkness, to one facing George Street and needing ear plugs. You get used to it and the staff were helpful. Its 3 dollars a night if you want a safe deposit box. Get to your room by stairs or lift. Buffet breakfast is available at $17. There is a pub attached to the place where most of the workers hang out after their shifts which makes it a good atmosphere. Specials on the menu have steak priced at $10 which I had most nights. Happy hours are available. Id recommend trying the Carlton Draft if you want a nice lager.

Two white for the bottom pillows and 2 colored slips that match the blanket. We enjoyed this lovely, clean, charming hotel.

Please don't - for the sake of keeping your mental helth as you won't be able to sleep there. I chose this hotel because of its location, which is really close to Central station and booked 2 nights. I has a really important professional exam on 7th December and arrived in the hotel the day before. Here is my story... 1. I'm not peaky about the view from the window, but mine was facing inner part of the building and when I started undressing I felt that someone was definitely looking at me - it was an old pervert pieking on me from the pathway from one side of the building the the other, which was located right next to my window. I had to close my window blindes properly to get rid of this guy. 2. I started re-reading materials for my exam and noticed that some strange high level (almost an ultrasound) noise was disturbing my thoughts. I turned-off air cond and fridge, but turned out that it came from inside the wall (I think my room was situated close to general air cond system of the building). I turned on my i-pod and coninued my studies. 3. In the evening I tried to get some sleep, but the sound intensified (probably more customers have turned on their air conditioners). I was thinking of getting to reception, but someone was banging the door in the corridor with such force that my bed was shaking with every bang - so I considered I would rather stay in the room till the morning. 4. I was unable to sleep throughout all night and decided to leave this terrible place 1 day earlier. I bought new airplane ticket via internet in the morning and went to the bathroom to take a shower and be gone. In the shower I found a new surprise - a flock of really annoying bugs, which were trying to sit on me whie I was in a shower - so this was one of the quickest shower experiences in my life. 5. I filled out a guest form saying that this was the worst hotel I've ever been (and I've been to 20 countries and around hundred hotels so far) and proceeded to check-out. Since I've booked this hotel with a condition of non-refundable payment I didn't ask for my money (and seriously the only thing I wished at that point is to get out of there). 6. I went to my exam and I was sllepy through all 3 hours of it (since I didn't sleep the night before). It was the 14th and last exam for my professional certification and I was there in a zombie condition - great. 7. On my way to the airport the hotel manager called me and said that the level of noise in their hotel is absolutely normal but that they did find some bugs in a bathroom. So he offered to give me back 1 night's fee and offered me to come and stay in their hotel again - yeah SURE.", "Date": "December 11, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "2", "Sleep Quality": "2", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Victoria", "Title": "\u201cThe Not so Great Southern Hotel\u201d", "Author": "rollo_100", "ReviewID": "UR88075846", "Content": "Unfortunately I made a bad mistake booking this hotel...

The restaurant is of the steak and chips school, so dinner at MarketCity might be a better health choice :-) Overall I enjoyed my stay here, and found it an excellent base for exploring Sydney on my own coin (although would go a little more upmarket if there on business).", "Date": "May 11, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "selina_eve", "Title": "\u201cGreat Location for the Price\u201d", "Author": "selina_eve", "ReviewID": "UR29670272", "Content": "I stayed in this hotel for a couple of days during a business trip. Didn't want to spend too much money cos I just needed a room to sleep in after work. Location was great as the train station was nearby. Booked my room through WOTIF.com a few days before the trip which gave a really good deal. Arrived at the hotel around 11am and check in was a breeze even though I was probably 3 hours earlier than the normal check in time. Since I have already paid, my actual check in took less than 3 min. However, the staff could have asked if I needed assistance as there was another asian couple checking out and he just assumed that we were together thus I had to wait quite a bit. Still, it was fine. Walking to the room was a little scary though so the security provided by the lifts was a plus. Rooms were typical hotel rooms but clean with comfy beds. Mini bar was empty which I was pretty amused by it as it was the first time I come across an empty mini bar. If you need something, you have to go to the reception to get it. Frankly, if I had to go to the reception to get it, I might as well walk to the streets and buy the stuff. But really, it wasn't really crucial to me. They had an ironing board and iron in the room which is good as I needed my clothes ironed since i was on a business trip. Shower area was a little tiny but what can you ask for the kind of price? I didn't get to use the restaurant or pub or internet. I already planned not to use the internet thus i chose this hotel. I knew that i would be expensive. Maybe if people can read before booking instead of complaining about it later. I don't think the hotel hides information. If not, just give them a call to clarify. Lots of food places within walking distance. Even though I was travelling alone and had to walk 10min to a restaurant at night after 11pm, I still felt quite safe as there were lots of people around. Overall, a pleasant experience. I will stay in this hotel again if I go to Sydney. But I will make sure I book everything before going so that I do not have to pay for the costly internet that everyone is talking about. If not, I will go to another hotel that provides complimentary internet.", "Date": "May 9, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Ballina, Australia", "Title": "\u201cGreat Stay at the Hotel Great Southern\u201d", "Author": "ToddBallina_NSW", "ReviewID": "UR26629454", "Content": "We stayed at the hotel Great Southern for 3 nights while we went to a show at the State Theatre. Overall we wanted something in the city, on a budget, but still with all the conveniences of a large hotel. We read a few reviews on Trip Advisor and decided to stay here. We booked via \"Rates to Go\" website as at the time they had the absolute cheapest rates. We paid $79.00 per night for the first two nights, then $119.00 for the Friday night (as there was a big event on in Sydney that weekend - its natural for the hotels to bump up their rates) - still cheap for a Hotel room in the Centre of Sydney though. All up we paid $ 277.00 for 3 nights. Gotta be happy with that. The Hotel is heritage listed - so the renovation reflects the overall 1940's charm of the building - a lot of the old art deco detail has been retained (old phone booths, smoked glass doors, old staircase) this was really refreshing to see - especially when all that is used in hotel construction these days is Laminex and Stainless steel...... The Hotel doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t look much from the outside - but the facade of the building had to be retained in the renovation - all nice inside though. Yes - the Hotel is located up the \"Dodgy\" end of George Street - but this need not worry you. Always heaps of people around on the street, everything feels really safe and normal. There is a Public Bar fronting George Street on the ground floor which is quite \"happening\" and good for a drink at the end of each day. Area outside on the footpath for outside dining / smokers though. Also a rear entrance which brings you out to Market City / Chinatown area. There is a Restaurant inside the hotel just off the Foyer - it never looked very busy though - so we ate elsewhere. There is also a gaming lounge within the hotel with another bar and pokies - but you don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t really see this unless you want to walk through it to the front bar. Our room - like I said - was renovated (prob for the 2000 Sydney Olympics). We fronted onto a courtyard - so had natural light. This area all looked newly built. The room is small, but has everything you need - think a standard hotel room - Bar fridge, Jug, Cable TV, Double bed, Wardrobe, Desk, chair, Bathroom, Toilet, Hair Dryer. - Actually our hair dryer didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t work - so housekeeping came up straight away and installed a brand new one - no questions asked. Bed was very comfy - Blockout curtains so you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll sleep in...... The rooms all are decorated in a Heritage style to match the hotel art deco era - all very nice and I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d say 4 star quality. Small rooms - but they were usable and not too small. The location of the hotel is very handy to Paddy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Market, Chinatown, QVB, 2 blocks from the Airport train line at Central Station, Close to the theatre's, Darling Harbour, Spanish Quarter, Hyde Park. Walk into the city is about 6 blocks and takes about 10 mins. But there is a also a free bus to major inner city stops which runs down George Street - or the Train if you pref. we just walked everywhere - take comfy shoes. Tip - If you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re going to walk down to Circular Quay, stroll over to Hyde Park and walk through it to get to the Harbour - a beautiful walk in the Morning with take away coffee and Portuguese Custard Tart. This will save all the stop / Go at the intersections and traffic lights down George Street.

This hotel is a 1920's pub that has been faithfully restored with a classic art-deco theme. At the same time, careful attention has been given to all the modern conveniences such as large wide screen LCD TV, ducted air and modern bathrooms. The fact that it is a real old-fashioned pub is both its strength and its weakness. It oozes character, but it is bound by the limitations of an old building; small box-like rooms without big windows, squeaky floors, small lifts etc. Despite it's modernisation, I still felt like I was staying in an old-style pub. The hotel is located close to Central station and in close proximity to Chinatown, markets and Darling Harbour. That makes it far more than a stroll to the main harbour area. However, buses run regularly down George Street and the train is quite close. It also means that it is in the rougher area of the city. Generally Sydney is very safe, but some people may feel more intimidated by the nightlife around this area of the city. Being on the main road, there was a little bit of noise. However, the double glazing reduced the worst of it. No noise from the pub below seemed to filter upstairs. Cheap counter meals are available at the pub downstairs. I couldn't see any sign of room service and the mini bar was empty. There were instructions on how to purchase items to place in the mini bar from the pub below. Not really what you expect from four-stars. Breakfast was satisfactory, offering cereals and a limited selection of hot dishes; Asian and English. There were no pastries and no fresh fruit. For an additional $18, I would rate the breakfast as ordinary value for money. Staff were helpful and courteous. However, the thing that impressed me the most was the bed. I have endured some pretty ordinary hotel beds. However, this bed was fantastic! It was incredibly comfortable, with a heavy, warm quilt and big fluffy pillows. If you choose your room on bed comfort, then this hotel is right up the top. However, the main reason that you would go to the Great Southern Hotel is the price. Rooms are discounted as low as $100 AU a night (without breakfast). You'd be lucky to find a dodgy two-star for less than that. This place is great value for money.

The hotel's location is great- near Central Station, a block from Paddy's Market, just near Chinatown, easy walk to Convention Centre and a stroll into Pitt Street Mall/ QVB. The hotel staff were great but I know it's the room you want to hear about. It was small, a bit dull and tired and I had to ring Reception to work out how to turn the lights out to sleep (pull the Card out of the wall). However, the room was fine. We were only there for an overnight stay and it was a great sleep in a comfy bed with good pillows. It was basically a suitable, basic room and a good shower. Nothing flash what so ever but it did its job for a good price. Would I stay there again? Probably, unless I wanted a nicer, bigger, more modern room with a few indulgences.", "Date": "May 12, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "3", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Canberra", "Title": "\u201cWonderful service, average rooms\u201d", "Author": "sydneygal85", "ReviewID": "UR5806283", "Content": "We stayed at this hotel overnight, while attending a function at Darling Harbour last week. From the outside, the hotel looks old and decrepit, however it has been renovated inside, and the reception area is very elegant and classy. I found the staff to be extremely pleasant and helpful, and the hotel as a whole to be alot more personal than other places I have stayed at. The room we were allocated was absolutely tiny! Do not expect a luxurious room while staying at this place! Extremely cramped with no amenities, just a bed, TV, and bathroom all crammed into a tiny space. No view whatsoever, hardly any natural sunlight as all. However, we were only using the room as a sleeping point, so it didn't affect us too much. Keep in mind our room was only a standard one, so those willing to pay a bit extra would probably be allocated a better room!! This hotel is good for travellers wishing to stay for a limited period (ie:overnight) and are just after basic accomodation, and a clean bed. As I mentioned earlier, the interior of the hotel is very elegant and classy, and the staff were extremely accomodating, it's really only the rooms which let it down! I would not recommend it for families, or people staying in Sydney for more than a night or two.", "Date": "September 16, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Service": "2", "Rooms": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "Adelaide Australia", "Title": "\u201cTerrible, dirty, dark and run-down\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR5407341", "Content": "I booked this hotel as a secret hotel on last minute.com. the description said it was 4 star - it was more like a backpackers.

It starts out hard to find as there is another Pacific International(Apartments)down the road and if you park for this you are subject to carrying luggage 15 minutes back up the road. Once we knew where to go there are parking stations quite close at A$15 per night. Check In was OK but I had booked a smoking room and was advised the whole hotel was non smoking. Arriving in the room was a real let down. Bad lighting, aged and worn furniture and a musty smell that could not escape as the windows can't be opened.The air conditioner had a rattle that was fixed with a couple of hits. The room was tiny as was the double bed, my feet hung over the edge. It was so dismal that we forsake the bottle of wine we brought and went to the bar which is quite good. Upon returning after the party we had a reasonable sleep until 4AM when numerous young men returned to next door which highlighted paper thin walls. The bathroom was as big as the room but had no shower screen and water pressure and temperature were a problem and the toilet leaked. Breakfast is A$11 per person and upon arriving we were sent back to reception to buy a ticket before entering the area and they were reluctant to add this to the room and requested cash. The breakfast was not to my liking, cold bacon, no serviettes, the orange juice was empty and this was only fixed after making a complaint. All in all I would never stay here again whatever the circumstance as there are far better and cheaper hotels closer to the main attractions.", "Date": "December 5, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Harrow, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cFabulous!\u201d", "Author": "perfectmuse", "ReviewID": "UR3911279", "Content": "I stayed at the Pacific for three weeks during Feb. and March of 2005.
