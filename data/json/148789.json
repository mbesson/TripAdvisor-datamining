There is a lot of tiling through out the place and between the afternoon showers and the watered plants, you're probably going to slip and fall. 2) Small rooms, which wouldn't have been so bad, but the bathrooms are terribly small and hard to move around...especially the shower! The shower curtain was an average sized curtain (which was folded in half to fit the small shower) and every single time I'd pull it back, sure enough a metal (and heavy) shower curtain ring would fall. The last time I got out of the shower, I got hit on the head (and the night before I had slipped on the stairs)... so I have come back with a few bruises. 3) HORRIBLE HORRIBLE HORRIBLE FOOD! I had read a lot of reviews (besides tripadvisor.com) and had read about which food items to avoid, so I did. Sure enough, I ordered a burrito ($14) and it was tasteless except for the burnt taste that came from the meat and tortilla chips... oh! And if you go here thinking that you'll just go ahead and try the burrito anyway, please be aware that litterally 3/4 of the burrito is stuffed with yellow rice. My husband got the pulled pork sandwhich and spit it out... (I tasted it and the \"BBQ\" sauce tasted like spaghetti sauce and the pork was dry) we had also ordered conch fritters.... I've never had a wet fritter, but this thing was over cooked and wet inside (all at the same time). I sent back the burrito and my bill was still $25... fyi NO FREE REFILLS so everytime you ask for a refill, that's $2 added to your bill and I KNOW I didn't drink a full can of coke. 4) Parking... goodness! Parking was horrible. Go there and you'll find out what I am talking about. Alone, I could tolerate the steep (and SMELLY ...the dumpster was never emptied while we were there and my husband and I would hold our breath while we ran to the car) parking lot but as I reflect on all the money I spent... it adds to my frustration! 5) hard pillows.... 6) After I cleaned up some hair in the bathroom, I had no other cleanliness issues 7) I was told \"NO PETS\", but heard a dog barking every morning and night ...SOOO ANNOYING! During the elections, vans with SUPER loud speakers drive around all day and night (we woke up to one) but obviously the motel cannot control this... My husband and I were eager every morning to get up and out of that place.

My wife and I are birders, so we look for a base of operations rather than a hang-out. There are 3 things I look for; a comfortable bed (their's was not bad; not the best but certainly not the worst I've slept on), a clean room (and it was), and a hot shower. It took a good while for the water to warm up. Some days it never quite warmed up enough, and it was a trickel rather than shower, but I've seen worse. The people are freindly enough. Room #1 was pretty small and had some minor issues (drawers that didn't open, for example). We got a mini-fridge, a microwave and the essentials. When the crowd's leaving at night, the noise echoes off the walls here and makes sleeping before 10 challenging at times. We had an issue with water that turned out to be much more major than expected and was certainly no fault of the hotel. We were relocated to a much nicer room (#305). As others have pointed out, you want a room above the pool; the difference is night and day. We'd have been thrilled to have had this room from the beginning of our stay and in fact asked from the outset for a room over the pool but this request was not honored until the pipe leak/water issue. Great water pressure here, nicer layout, more spacious; nicer all around. I want to warn you- the tiled steps around the place are very slippery when wet!! Be careful. I could've been really hurt sliding off the steps at one point but thankfully received only minor scrapes. The staff noticed and were genuinely concerned about this but I insisted I was OK. We tried both restaurants. The upstairs/higher-end Lazy Parrot version, although pricier, is worth the difference in price. Try it at least once. There is an octopus appetizer that will knock your socks off. We were blown away by how good the food was here. The Rum Shack was also OK and more reasonably priced. My wife and I are not your average tourists and are in fact quite intrepid. We explored much of the western end of the island by car from this one base; Maricao, Guanica, Cabo Rojo (highly recommended), Arecibo and Guajataca. We spent a day in Old San Juan as well. Driving here is dangerous. If you've ever driven in Central America, you'll have a primer in what it might be like, but it is barely comparable. The DR is similar in respects with one critical difference. The roads in Puerto Rico are small by any standards, often smaller than the width of two cars. Guajataca for example is simply hazardous to attempt and certainly not for the faint of heart. Route 2 is not bad and is flat but is crowded and riddled with traffic from dawn to dusk and beyond. The secondary roads are just wide enough to get by and the locals are used to them. They will fly by you at breakneck speed and scare the h377 out of you. Great fun if you're ready for it. The interior of the island is full of mountains and makes for windy twisty roads as well, adding to their complexity. Don't try the dirt roads without 4 wheel drive and consider Guajataca only if you have a lot of extra time. We also discovered that some roads simply end, in spite of their existence on our map (from Amazon). We've seen this in other places as well but here it caught us off guard at least once.", "Date": "February 28, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "1", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Baltimore, Maryland", "Title": "\u201cStuck with a Leaky Ceiling\u201d", "Author": "missjr", "ReviewID": "UR124977548", "Content": "Our ceiling was leaking (and our room kinda smelled).

I visited w/ my cousin & friend and the restaurant & 2 bars (rum bar included) were stellar. The grounds are breathtaking behind the seemingly dull front exterior. The hotel is NOT on the beach, but the views overlooking the valley between the beach and the hotel are awesome. In addition, the grounds beyond the restaurant are like walking through a rainforest. The pool, bars, steps, hotel, etc. are reminiscent of venturing through El Yunque. My girlfriend & I arrived after 5 after visiting my favorite beach (Maria's) to check out the local scene & surfing. We drove up from Ponce and had no reservations which was our MO for the entire trip. Much to our surprise, the desk was closed with a message to call a number for questions or last minute bookings. We called the # and a gentleman was expeditious in driving over to check us in. He brought us into the laundry area, opening a book that read, \"walk-ins\". The options for rooms were all under $100 including tax which were the cheapest of our trip; I didn't object. The 3rd floor room was great initially as it had been recently renovated. Awesome floors, tile bathroom throughout, great bedding/bedroom furniture. However, our big issue was the the upfront mildew malodor upon entry. I've detected this odor before but it's usually caused by older carpet & linens which were absent here. So, we investigated the wall a/c unit (which was the only remaining culprit) and detected massive black mold within the unit. My girlfriend mentioned objecting, but for the rate and our late arrival, I suggested a quick trip to Econo to purchase some lysol to rectify the situation. This did the trick since we were only staying 1 night. We left the a/c unit off and opened up all available openings. Keep in mind, this unit is on the eastern end/3rd floor which is obstructed by palm trees and thus, minimal sunlight. We loved the Lazy Parrot; the only reason for a less than stellar review is the malodor from the neglected a/c unit.

The room was prety large, with the bed, two nightstands, a built-in vanity, a small refrigerator, a small closet with a microwave, a very pretty updated bathroom, and a small, enclosed patio with two chairs and a small table. LOVED the room!!! Romantic, and had all of the featured you'd need on a trip. It was also very, very clean. AC was nice and cold. The grounds are beautiful, and we spent a considerable aount of time at the Rum Shack- lots of locals come by to eat, so it's a great place to meet some friendly and interesting people. The food was delicious (I recommend the conch fritters and mahi tacos!), but the LP restaurant was closed for the slow season, so we didn't get to eat there. Plenty fo tasty options nearby and close to town. Complimentary breakfast at the Parrot was ideal- just walk downstairs for coffee, waffles, bagels, fruit, yogurt, etc. Francia with the LP was very helpful to me in plannign my trip- she was able to give me info on surf lessons, directions, ater-hours check-in, dining, etc. I highly recommend the Parrot to anyone traveling to Rincon!!

Once we entered, I was quickly reminded that looks can be deceiving and not to judge a book by its cover. Inside, we found a beautiful, clean, and tropical atomosphere that was very charming and quite relaxing. The staff was friendly and very accomodating, including the hotel manager in the office, the bartenders, and the housekeeping staff. Very unexpectedly, we needed to add two more nights to the end of our trip when our flight home was cancelled due to a tropical storm. We were offerred an excellent rate and were allowed to stay in the same room without a problem, even though it was already booked for other guests (who were moved to another room). The food at the Rum Shack in the Lazy Parrot was probably the best we had during our stay in Rincon, even compared to the other highly recommended restaurants we went to. The gardens were beautiful and it was very nice to stroll around the hotel at night and sit outside, especially since everything is lit up so beautifully when it gets dark. Just make sure you bring or buy ALOT of bug spray because I was eaten alive by mosquitos, but that goes with the territory when you visit the tropics. It was off season when we were there so there were no activities or any entertainment at all at the hotel and the main restaurant and bar were closed. In the hotel's defense, the website did state that the restaurant and bar would be closed and didn't list any activities for the off season, but it would be nice if there was something going on, at least on the weekend, to cater to guests who visit during this season. During our extra two days, it rained all day because of the storm and there was absolutely nothing at all to do. When we visit Rincon again, we will probably go during high season because there wasn't anything to do other than the beach, but we would definitely stay at the Lazy Parrot again!! Just consider the time of year when booking your trip if you're looking for activities other than the beach. Another thing to mention is that there are quite a few steps at this 3 level hotel, which wouldn't be a problem at all except that they are very, very, very, extremely slippery when they are wet.... And since people are always wet from the pool and the beach, the steps were always very slippery. I fell twice, once on the way up the steps in the front of the hotel and once on our way down to the Rum Shack from our room... and I still have the bruises to prove it. By the end of our trip, I was paranoid about walking up and down the steps without falling. But please don't let any of my comments stop you from staying at the Lazy Parrot Inn because it really is the loveliest hotel in Rincon. Just make sure your flip flops have good grips on the soles to avoid falling like I did. Overall, we had a wonderful time on our trip and I highly recommend the Lazy Parrot Inn.

All I can say is that the sunsets were incredible. The one 'drawback' is that the beach is not really within walking distance. Walking to the beach is downhill, on a street without sidewalks. And I am not sure if it was just my experience, but cars in Puerto Rico don't seem to go too slow.

The young man who waited on us, Reno, was very helpful, and informative about the town and about your menu he started by recommending the mahi mahi for my self and the rib eye for my husband, he was so passionate about the way he described the food and the process in which it was prepared that we thought he had to be more than just a waiter, maybe a manager or owner, but he quickly told us that he was just a server, he also paired our food with some very tasty wines. The food was simply amazing, the fish was fresh and the flavors all came together perfectly on the plate, my husbands rib eye was juicy and tender and he didn't need the steak knife at all, the butter knife was sufficient, we had never thought in our wildest dreams that we would find food and service of this kind anywhere on this island since we haven't had the same luck at any of the other restaurants around town.

We took two two friends with us from Europe and had been raving. The place is easy to find and it unfolds itself little by little. The check-in was pleasant and the first drink at the bar was in a friendly and relaxed atmosphere, though getting drinks in a plastic cup took points off. The room was large, with a great mural and the bed was comfortable, if a little soft. There was only warm water in the shower, but it was like that justa bout everywhere I stayed on the Island. It normally doesn't bother me, but it was unseasonably cold and it would have been nice. All four of us are people who smoke a cigarette or two a day, and though most of the sitting areas are outside, we were sent outside of the gate to smoke, with no seats and no ashtray. I realize that surfer folk may not like smokers, but we were paying customers who were paying for a comfortable experience. The dinner was great. The sweet potatoes with the mahi-mahi were the best I have ever had. The sauce for the wahoo appetizer was spicier than we would have wished. The lemongrass creme brulee was to die for. Good wine list. There was free wifi. Plus points!! It did not work on my computer in the room (though it did on my husband's computer), but with such lovely tables to sit at around the property, it was hardly a hardship. The negatives. During no point in our stay, were there towels of any kind in the outdoor bathrooms and the bathroom near the Rum Bar was unpleasant. Our friend's toilet overflowed in the middle of the night from low pressure. If you need anything such as an iron or blowdryer (which surfers probably never need), make sure to ask for them upon check-in, as no one will be in the office to get them until the next morning. We all appreciated that there is a request for quiet after 11:00, but is was too bad that there was really nowhere where we could sit together and talk in the evenings.

While we are on the topic of cocktails, you have to go to calypso by Maria's beach - its a real layed back place with great views. At night we went to the Pool Bar to have sushi and drinks. They play surf movies on a huge screen and you can take a dip in the pool (hence the name) while you wait for your spicy tuna rolls.

The hotel is very clean. I couldn't give it a solid 5, because there was a guy in a wheelchair who told me he was having a real hard time getting around.

Next morning the hotel desk assured me that it is the only noisy night of the week, and that all noise is strictly curtailed after 11PM. Wrong! Found out Monday is surfer night with cheap drinks, live music and a rowdy crowd of surfer dudes. Parking lot was full with bar patrons, had to park on street. Hotel management is not on-site at night. Called the night number at 11:20 and got an answering machine (Spanish). Guests are clearly on their own after hours. So I got myself down to speak with the \"management\" at the bar, who turned out to be a young guy drinking and partying with the rest of the crowd. I pointed out that per signs posted around the place, all noise is supposed to shut off at 11PM. He didn't look happy about it but he did send the band packing. The crowd remained. At about midnight, I heard a fellow hotel guest twice yell off his balcony that it was time to cut it off, and the crowd dispersed by 1AM. I'm grateful we got out of there before the advertised St. Paddy's Day party took place. When I checked out, nobody was interested enough to ask how our stay was. Why the hotel management takes such a hands-off attitude about what goes on there after hours is beyond me. It's a real shame, because otherwise the Lazy Parrot would be a little jewel and I would give it an excellent rating.

Some days there was yogurt, other days not. No other protein was available. I know it's billed as a continental breakfast, but even some hard boiled eggs and some sliced pineapple and mango would go a long way to making it more festive and satisfying. A couple of nights they had loud parties around the pool, although they stopped around 11pm or midnight. But it was loud enough that we couldn't enjoy the balcony those nights and had to retreat to the room with the door closed and the AC on. It also filled up the parking lot with party guests, so we had to find a spot on the street. But no matter. There are 2 restaurants on the premises, and both have good, though somewhat trendy, food.

Two good restaurants and bars on-site \u00e2\u20ac\u201c under separate management. Drinks expensive. Issues \u00e2\u20ac\u201c there are some basic but related issue with the Lazy Parrot due to the owner having leased out the bars and restaurants. One problem, for example, is that, while the pool bar shut at around 11pm, the other bar only few yards away seem to retain a very noisy crowd until the early hours and the courtyard layout echoes the noise. As far as I could see the people at the bar where not staying at the hotel and the barman did not seem to be bothered that they were keeping us awake. New Years\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 party was worse. We went out and came back at around 12.30am to find some small clusters of kids (not staying at the hotel) dancing to a very, very noisy disco. The hotel\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s party was supposed to finish at 1am, but at 1.30am the absolutely deafening disco was still shaking the walls of our room (would have gone out and joined them if the music had been any good!). Eventually I put on some clothes and went out and asked the DJ to turn down the sound \u00e2\u20ac\u201c at which point he immediately turned it off, saying that he was due to finish by then. The owner of the restaurant was there and he should have been aware of the hotel guests \u00e2\u20ac\u201c but presumably wanted to keep the party going. Another related problem is that the staff working in the two restaurants and bars don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t want to know about hotel issues.

We had to carry our luggage up a flight of stairs through a restaurant and down several flights of stairs to get to the check in. Once we checked in we had to carry our luggage back up several flights of stairs through the restaurant and up another flight of stairs. If you have difficulty going up and down stairs this is not the place for you. Our balcony view was nothing special but our room was very clean and well maintained. During our stay there we met with the owners who where there daily and seemed like very nice people. My family and I spent a lot of time by the pool which was great and had drinks and food from the Rum Shack. The food and drinks at the Rum Shack and Smilin Joe were great however I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m not too sure of the math that they were using at the Rum Shack.

Probably not.", "Date": "April 28, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Shanghai, China", "Title": "\u201cGreat Little Place\u201d", "Author": "2schlaffs", "ReviewID": "UR14945085", "Content": "My best friend and I just returned from staying here for 4 nights. We had a very good stay at the Lazy Parrot. It is simple and clean with suitable food options on-site and very friendly staff. I had found a deal on Expedia on our room and so we were in the older section of the hotel which is probably more budget friendly. We did not have any problems with it and were happy with our accomodations. A few things to be aware of, the \"balcony\" for our room (room 9) was actually just a wide entry way with a couple chairs and our room was right at the front of the hotel so there was some noise from the road. Finding the office to check-in is a bit of a scavenger hunt when you first arrive as you have to wind up and down several sets of stairs and through the beautiful gardens to the other side of the hotel. Definitely leave your bags in the car until you find out where your room is located. While we are in our 30's, it appeared that several of the other guests were seniors and very much enjoying themselves. The breakfast was good, mostly just danishes and toast though and once things run out they aren't readily replaced. The mornings we were down earlier there was some yogurt, fruit and coffee cream, some of the other mornings, there was not. The hot water situation can be a little bit annoying...after a day of beach-going or hiking a warm shower can be nice and only 2 of 4 of my showers included warm water. Overall though, we were very happy with our stay here and would easily stay here again or recommend it.", "Date": "April 10, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "5.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Albany, NY", "Title": "\u201cGood times in RIncon\u201d", "Author": "lambert13", "ReviewID": "UR14794023", "Content": "My wife and I stayed at the Lazy Parrot during January of 2008 for 5 days. We stayed at the Rincon Beach Resort for the first part of our stay because the Lazy Parrot had no availability for those days. In our opinion, the Lazy Parrot wins, hands down. It is a very good value for your dollar kind of place. The good: - Nice clean spacious room. Good bathroom. I really liked the balcony/patio outside of our Panoramic room. - Continental breakfast in the morning. Always fresh and fully stocked. It was nice even to go sit out by the pool in the morning and have a cup of coffee. - The Rum Shack. Love love love that place. Reggae night was a whole lot of fun. - Smilin Joes. Great food even though it's a bit overpriced. The Bad: (nothing really bad, just wanted the contrasting title) - The roosters across the street. They woke me up at 4am our first night there. Second night had no problem with them - The only other bad thing is that I am not there right now. Some other Rincon highlights..... - Tamboo. Good food, good people, good bar, great view, good times all around - Rock Bottom. Awesome place to hang out - Panderia Libonese. Best breakfast sandwiches in town. Other than that, just rent a car and go explore.

It is nestled in the hills and has views of the ocean. We stayed in the new building - our room was comfortable, clean and nicely decorated with a large balcony overlooking the swimming pool. There is a casual, friendly feel to the place and it was a nice contrast to the large resort in San Juan where we had stayed. The pool is nice but the hot tub was cold during our visit. There are 2 restaurants, one outdoors by the pool which has a decent menu and good food. We did not eat at the restaurant upstairs which is a little more formal but the menu looked inviting. There are some lovely outdoor tables set in little secluded areas. There are 2 cages with parrots and love birds that our kids loved. Our stay included continental breakfast which again was eaten by the pool. While waiting for our dinner the first night, our kids played with other kids around the pool area while we chatted with other guests. It was definately relaxing for us and our children. On the downside, when we arrived, we had already been in Peurto Rico for a week and had three big pieces of luggage. We had to lift them up a flight of stairs, then down a series of steps at the other side and then up two flights of stairs to our room!!! I asked if there was anyone to help with bags and was told no! On our departure, we discovered that we could drive down the side of the inn and bring our bags out by the bar but that still involved lugging them down two flights. Also, on our first night, the ice machine was out of ice and the blender to make frozen drinks was broken. The second night we stayed, there was an engagement party by the pool and some other event going on and the place was crowded. We placed our order for dinner shortly before 8pm and at 8:40pm were told that they were out of one of the items that we ordered. I ordered a salad instead (thinking it would be quick) but by 9pm still no food and one of our kids had fallen asleep. At that point, we cancelled our order and went to our room. There was music blaring by the pool until 11pm which was right underneath our balcony. This may have been a once off - the waiter was really haried - but it might be worth checking with them if there are any parties scheduled during your stay. Also, there is a small step-up going from the pool area to the breakfast area that is not that obvious and we noticed a few people trip over it. On the morning we were leaving, a woman fell over it dropping a glass plate and landed on a piece of broken glass that went into her knee. This is a definate hazard that could be easily rectified by painting the step up a bright color. Pool hours are only from 10am to 6pm but did not seem to be strictly enforced. Our kids are early risers and bugged us from 8am to go in the pool but we did not permit them because of the rule. We were more comfortable with breaking it when other guests were swimming in the pool outside these hours. You also need your own towels to bring to the beach, which we did not know. On the whole, we loved the ambiance and the casual laid back feel at the Lazy Parrot. I think we were unfortunate on our second night and that this may have been an anomoly. We would give it another try.", "Date": "March 28, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Easton, Pennsylvania", "Title": "\u201cSimple but Great\u201d", "Author": "TheSimpleTraveler", "ReviewID": "UR14541712", "Content": "We were looking for a budget priced accomodation to rest our bodies for 5 nights so that we could enjoy the warmth of Rincon, Puerto Rico during the day time. The Lazy Parrot fit the bill perfectly. Our accomodations were simple and clean. Although the room was small and cozy, it was just right for my wife and I. Afterall, we didn't come to Rincon in the middle of the winter to stay in a room. We were there to enjoy the beaches, the sunshine, the people and the drinks! Booking the room over the Internet was easy. Franzia, the hostess answered any questions I had via e-mail. The check-in was easy. Considering the fact that we arrived at the Inn at about 1am, we had no trouble checking into our room as Franzia had given us instructions as to what to expect and where our key would be located. The Inn has a distinct tropical ambience to it. It has a quaint tropical setting, a nice pool and a soothing breeze, which always seemed to caress us any time of the day. The place was quiet during the day and a bit lively at night as it anchors a restaurant, Smilin' Joe's and a pool bar, The Rum Shack. We didn't get to sample the fare at Smilin' Joe's, but we did frequent The Rum Shack several times during our stay. We enjoyed their hot wings immensely. A simple continental breakfast awaited us each morning and was just right to take us into lunch. Nothing fancy, but enough to suffice our appetites. For those travelers who are conscious of the environment, the Lazy Parrot is a Green Hotel. They do their best to conserve the resources with solar cells to heat their water, which brings to mind about the only slight inconvenience of our stay. Because one or two days were cloudy, for one day our shower water was not as warm as we would have liked it. And the hot tub wasn't that hot either. But we didn't need to use the hot tub and we took a quick shower. The remaining days our showers were hot. To sum it up, if you are looking for elegance and pampering, the Lazy Parrot would most likely not be your style. But if you are a budget minded traveler, looking for a simple getaway mixed with some fun, in the hills of Rincon, you can't go wrong with this place. In fact, my wife and I hope to return there next winter.", "Date": "March 26, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Vestal, NY", "Title": "\u201cLovely place\u201d", "Author": "Grandmajoan", "ReviewID": "UR13837457", "Content": "We stayed a week (less a missed day due to a Useless Airways snafu).
