We vacillated between this property and the Sheraton Marina Hotel. This had larger rooms and but the Marina had a balcony. Ultimately we picked the larger room with this hotel as we were travelling with our 2 kids and this hotel seemed to be more centrally located. (We ruled out the W and Westin because of room size). We decided to stay on the Club Level which included a high floor, hors d'oeuvre, free WI-FI and free breakfast buffets each day. The Club Level was certainly worth the extra points (not sure what the cash difference would have been). The location was pretty good - we were able to walk to the Westfield Shopping Center and even down to the USS Midway with ease (Note: The Westin's location is much better for both). We thought that we would use the trolley system and it was too complicated for people that aren't used to it. The stops aren't frequent enough and the routes aren't convenient (Note: I am not against mass transit, I love the NY Subway system). The breakfast buffett was good, though after a couple of days got to be old. They have cereal, bacon, sausage, eggs, potatoes, fruit, oatmeal, bagels, made to order omelettes, french toast (or pancakes). The club lounge food was very limited and wasn't a very good value add. There was a small fridge with some soda and water. The food was pretty gross and was the same each day. The staff was friendly and helpful. The best part of the room was the layout. There was a fridge with mini bar and microwave. There was a separate tub from the shower (both small) - but the room itself felt clean. The negatives: The drawers had a musty smell. The fan blew all night which was a little annoying because it dried out the room. The pull out bed was really uncomfortable - my 3 year old opted to just sleep on the couch vs the bed. The springs were pokey and loud. I'm still giving this hotel a \"very good\" rating because we were happy with the stay, the service, and the room. Definitely points well used with this hotel.", "Date": "April 22, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "St. Louis", "Title": "\u201cDecent, clean, and gets the job done\u201d", "Author": "St_LouisDee", "ReviewID": "UR128131193", "Content": "The hotel is clean, but you have to request a fridge; and food prices are pretty steep. $45/day for breakfast buffet for 2 (including 20% tip). Buffet is not extensive, however, the make-to-order omelettes, and included beverages are what kept us coming back. Due to time constraints, the buffet was the best option. One night we paid nearly $25 for a room-service burger, and a can of soda. The burger & fries was $14; 12 oz. soda was $3; plus the 21% gratuity, and $3.50 service charge. I think the hotel could make lots more money on their food service if the prices were more reasonable. Other than that, the staff was very friendly, professional, and accommodating. The rooms were average (for what I expected of a Sheraton), and in need of modernization. There was a flat screen in the living room, but an older model box tv in the bedroom. As far as location, it was just a block or so from the tip of the Gaslamp Quarter. My husband and I aren't the athletic type, but with comfortable shoes, and much excitement, managed to walk the entire area. So, I would give this hotel 5 stars for cleanliness, professionalism, and convenience. But their prices definitely forced us outside of the hotel for meals (other than breakfast).

It is within walking distance to the Gaslamp district. They call this hotel Sheraton Suites but one would expect a kitchenette in a suite. There was a microwave but no fridge. We called the front desk and they sent a mini fridge up. The room was the size of a slightly larger than average hotel room but just separated by french doors. The pull out couch was atrocious if you actually needed to pull it out. I sat down on it and instantly sunk to the floor! No, I am not overweight. My child could not sleep on this. There were two beds in the bedroom so we managed. The bathroom door has a sliding door that is a pain. It makes a horrible banging noise when you close it, hence waking up everyone in the middle of the night if you have to use it. The parking sucks. You have to spiral up 7 floors (until you are green) and then wind up another 4 floors until you get to the Sheraton parking. After that you need to take an elevator up one floor. Then you are in the lobby. Then you can finally take an elevator up to your floor. A tad convoluted, don't you think? All for the price of $23 a day! With the bad out of the way I will get to the good. It is not a fine hotel. Good location. The rooms are clean. They even provide wine glasses which I find unusual for a Sheraton. The staff was wonderful. The bartenders in the lounge were very, very personable. I'm sorry I didn't get their names. In fact, all of the staff we encountered went out of their way to be very friendly. We really appreciate this.

Our expensive candy basket had open packages in it, the mini bar was out of order, the carpet was dirty, and the windows were dirty. We were on the 19th floor, so we cleaned our windows so we could look out. The bed was SUPREME as far as that goes, but the top comforter was dirty, with what looked to be chocolate smears.

Room was fine but smelled a bit musty. Went back down to front desk to see if there was another room available. Same clerk helped us and was very accomodating. We moved to the hypo-allergenic floor and the room smelled much better. The size of the room was very comfortable for a family of 4. It was nice to have 2 full size beds and the sofa sleeper as well as 2 TVs. We went swimming in the indoor pool. It smelled very strongly of chlorine which got to me after 10 minutes or so. We also noticed that at both the pool and the spa that a cover over the drain on the ouside wall was loose. Seemed like it could be a safety hazard if it was stepped on so we stayed away from it. We ate at the bar and the food was fine although the service was slow at 3:00 in the afternoon. Spent $40 on 2 appetizers and 2 sodas. Not a great price but very convenient before heading out for the night. We loved being in the downtown area within walking distance to the gaslamp district.

This high rise hotel is located above the San Diego Symphony Hall in the downtown area just a few minutes walk from the Gaslamp District. The lobby / front office is located on the 12th floor of the hotel. A restaurant and bar are located adjacent to the lobby along with several meeting rooms, a pool, and a gym that are located on the same floor. A friendly front office associate promptly checked me in and welcomed me to the hotel. He was kind enough to ask me if I needed any maps, recommendations on places to see, or dining recommendations for the area. I was assigned a room on the 25th floor overlooking Balboa Park and the airport. The room was spacious with a nice lounge area with flat screen TV and bar service area (with sink) that also included a microwave oven. Adjacent to the lounge was a work area with a desk and Internet connection. Internet service was offered at an extra charge. The bedroom was located behind a set of French doors adjacent to the lounge area. There was a standard tube TV in the bedroom. The bed was extremely comfortable. The bathroom was divided into two separate rooms. There was a sink and large closet in the first room. A toilet, bathtub and separate shower stall were in the second room. With the exception of some stains on the carpet in the bedroom and small patches of mildew on the caulking in the bathroom and some spotty, poorly applied, caulking around the shower stall, the entire room appeared clean and well maintained. The furniture in the room was standard hotel furniture, maybe even a little \u201cupscale\u201d for hotel furniture, with some pieces that were due for replacement due to having numerous scratches. Over my three day stay at the hotel I had breakfast in the hotel restaurant each morning. The restaurant offers a nice buffet with hot and cold selections but I decided to order from the menu as the buffet was simply too much food for breakfast. All of the staff I encountered in the restaurant were welcoming and provided prompt and courteous service. The food I ordered was tasty and of good quality and was served to me within a reasonable period of time. Overall, I found this hotel offers a quality hard and soft product with the soft product accentuated by the hotel\u2019s quality staff. Unfortunately, I did not have my camera with me during this trip but the photos posted by others here on Trip Advisor accurately depict the room in which I stayed. GETTING THERE If you are arriving by plane and don\u2019t mind taking public transportation, metro bus #992 can take you to and from the airport directly into downtown for just $2.25 each way. There are bus stops just outside each of the terminals at the airport. Disembark at Broadway and 8th Streets which is about a 15-20 minute ride from the airport depending on the time of day and traffic conditions. Walk back to 7th Street, turn right, and walk north (up the slight hill) for three blocks to \u201cA\u201d Street then turn right. The entrance to the hotel is mid-block. If you arrive by train, the hotel is about a 15-20 minute walk, east on Broadway (turn left on Broadway after exiting the train station), then left on 7th Street to \"A\" Street. You can also catch the #992 airport bus on Broadway, either the Orange Line trolley towards Gillespie Field or the Blue Line trolley towards San Ysidro (disembark at 5th Street), or catch a taxi.", "Date": "October 19, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "New York City, New York", "Title": "\u201c\"Business Travel\"\u201d", "Author": "Joe_NY7", "ReviewID": "UR119453974", "Content": "I stayed at the hotel while attending a conference, while I must say that the property is not uniform with other Sheraton hotels I have visited the staff more than makes up for this with their courtesy and excellent customer service.

Desk is basic, almost looks like they bought from a second hand repo company and the chair is comfortable but I could not figure out how to make the back recline (my fault probably versus the chair). Great news is they have a zip strip on the desk so outlets are not an issue. Downside is no wireless in the room so you need to sit at the desk to use the internet, c\u2019mon it is 2011. Lots of lights and they are needed since the living area is not well lit through the windows. Bed is outstandingly comfortable; highlight of the room, and that is a good thing. A 5-8 year old TV is also in the bedroom area. Bathroom exceptionally clean, thank you, six mini-bottles of soaps and stuff. Looks like they just re-did and used Restoration Hardware, all clean lines and much more modern than other room. This Sheraton believes in the 2-towel approach so if you need more ask on arrival. Tub and a separate stall shower but be aware that the stall shower is about 2-feet by 2-feet, i.e. teenie-tiny. Decent water pressure and I was on the top floor. Ate lunch in the Restaurant, I would say lousy to fair at best, almost an in-house version of a low end chain restaurant. Chicken Quesadilla was a combination of processed stuff, not sure I would eat there, walk 1 block down the hill to 6th St for same low quality for half the price. TV check out works fine.

The only thing we dislike is the parking which you have to drive through this narrow spiral driveway to level 11 to park. There was a day where we try to do all the things we needed and get back to hotel late so we can avoid driving into and out of the carpark too many times as you can get very dizzy. Parking is also $23 a day. The hotel is about a 10 mins walk to 5th ave where most restaurants are. There are some homeless people on the street so when we walked back to the hotel, we need to pick the streets where there are restaurants/shops and avoid the dark corners. I think it's relatively safe to walk back before 9pm. After that time, I will suggest you catch a taxi.

We thought we would try a different Sheraton this time around since we've been to the Sheraton Mission Valley. This Sheraton is much closer to downtown area and Balboa Park which has a lot to do including the San Diego Zoo. We were impressed with the general layout of this all-suite hotel, since we have a toddler. The separation of rooms is nice even though it did feel a bit cramped. We were upgraded to the Club Level floor (26th) with a view of the San Diego bay and convention center. Directly across was a high rise business building. Although I'm not sure how much different the rooms are because when we went to the Club Lounge, it was a weird setup. First it wasn't in the same area as the Club Level rooms, which seems to make more sense. Second, the amenities in the Club lounge was somewhat lacking even in comparison to the Mission Valley location. At least there, you got to sit in a room that actually felt more like a lounge, they offered, a continental breakfast and also an afternoon wine and cheese. But not at this Sheraton Suites! It was actually quite awkward when I went into the lounge, you go past the restaurant then come around to your \"private\" entry. Once inside you see a sign that points to \"breakfast buffet\" thinking that this was part of the deal. Because we've been to Sheraton MIssion Valley where it is part of the deal at Club Level. I mean, what's the advantage of a club level room if there really isn't anything special about it? It does offer soda and coffee. But that's it. Very awkward conversation with the wait staff - who came down hard on me because I was getting a small carton of milk for my 2-year old son saying it wasn't part of the Club Lounge. Embarrassing and also confusing. Decent rooms- somewhat dated, quick check-in and checkout, courteous valet albeit the $30 charge. You pay for convenience. Location is easy access to the freeways. It is walking distance to gaslamp quarter and can find alternative dining experience nearby. Disappointed with club level lounge location and amenities.

There were other little things that didn't make me happy like the phone wasn't working properly, but the bloody finger print stain was unacceptable.

This was a MAJOR problem and a MAJOR disappointment for us. The room did not seem to have been vacuumed before we checked in, and I am sure it was not vauumed once during our whole stay. Many days the room was obviously not properly cleaned - our dirty coffee cups, glasses and crumbs on the carpets etc. awaiting us when we returned. More often than not, we had to ask for or leave notes requesting that the supplies be replenished (shampoo, soap, lotion, coffee, etc.) even when it should have been fairly obvious.

The heated pool and spa are nice and the gym is okay but a bit small - only a few treadmills and cycles, no weights. The staff were very nice and warm - they greet you with a \"Welcome back\" as you come through the lobby which is very nice and the concierge staff were always very informative and helpful. The big disappointment was housekeeping - we noticed from the very first night that the room was not as sparkling clean as you would have expected and it never got better. There were many times when we came in and had to do our own cleaning up after the housekeeper had cleaned. The housekeeper was also inconsistent - sometimes you got replenished supplies, sometimes you didn't. I expect better from any hotel and I really didn't expect this of a Sheraton at all. Hopefully this is something that they can fix because the hotel is very nice otherwise.", "Date": "January 6, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "1", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "1", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Chandler, Arizona", "Title": "\u201cDirty rooms, but very nice customer service\u201d", "Author": "Luckey22", "ReviewID": "UR91599281", "Content": "The rooms were dirty and not clean at all.

The rooms are large and well laid out. It is within a 10-15 minute walk from gas lamp district and convenient to freeways for sightseeing (close to park, zoo,etc.) We paid $199/night (plus tax) for Starwood Club level rooms, which included lounge access and breakfast. When we checked in, we were told that the only club level rooms left had no views, so all three parties were put on the \"pure\" (hypoallergenic) floor. I am curious whether the rooms on the club level were nicer, despite blocked views from the adjacent building. While our room itself was nice, the bathroom ( particularly the shower which appeared to be a remnant from the 1960's) was outdated and needed updating and new fixtures. The shower dripped and leaked out the door. The club lounge at this property was a small, windowless room off of the breakfast area, and not a pleasant place to spend time. We ended up sitting in the main lounge and buying wine (house not really drinkable-but we are wine country frequenters) and the bartender, Jason (top notch guy) brought us out snacks and sodas for the kids. Damon (the food manager) was very friendly and discussed the issues with the club lounge with us, but could not explain the room level situation. Breakfast was fairly good, but they were surprised daily by our request for a table for eight which seemed to send them into a frenzy. Also, even though I booked a room (for one adult and two teens) that included breakfast, it turned out at check in that it only included breakfast for two...very disappointing and not explained at booking. Breakfast, if not included in the room rate is $17, which is too steep for what is offered. All-in-all, this is a fine hotel, not outstanding. It is a small property with nice sized rooms and somewhat limited amenities.

We normally prefer the Starwood hotels, so this was a good choice for our family given that it is a suites hotel. The bell hop/valets were always helpful with directions, the check-in process was speedy and she was very eager to please. A few things to know: We stayed on the 25th floor and the rooms are in need of updating.Wallpaper, popcorn ceilings, a bit dated....but, maybe they are waiting for a better economy. Can't fault 'em! We had a view of the airport and all the planes coming in, we loved it because our 4 year old son enjoyed watching them land. However, if you want a quiet room without the roar of airplanes, you may want a different side of the hotel or possibly a hotel located in a different area. Room service: Holy smokers...$34 for an order of pancakes, an order of bacon and an ice tea. I stayed at the Sheraton in Moorea, Tahiti where a breakfast for two was less expensive! Exorbitant. Parking: Yes, exorbitant too. $20 for self park, $30 for valet (per day). We scored and found street parking across the street for two of our three days--but that was because of the holidays. Oh, and a drunk guy was knocking at our door in the middle of the night and we called hotel security--they were Johnny on the spot--so that was good. We weren't concerned...just a young kid having a good time and lost his room in the sea of rooms, but it was nice that they were quick to act.

Fiance and I stayed here for business so it was covered by his company (probably wouldn't stay here otherwise since we were here 8 days).

For example...parking is NOT included and costs $23 a day (you have to head up to the 11th floor to park) which is added at the end of your stay. So factor that into your budget before looking for a hotel. Wireless internet is NOT included in your rooms. It's great in the lobby if you want to sit on a couch to get online.

(Also, I would NOT recommend the hotel restaurant...we went there once, our server disappeared during our ENTIRE meal...no drink refills, and we had to track her down for our check, making us late.) Other than that, it was good. Location is nice, within walking distance to some great spots if you want to go out for drinks or a meal later. The room was lovely. Staff was friendly to my fiance (although I was annoyed when we checked in...the front desk attendant immediately said, \"we'll be with you in a moment, sir,\" and \"How are you today, sir?\" completely annoying me and referring to my fiance for the duration of the check-in process even though the reservation was under my name and my credit card.

When I arrived I checked out the public areas and my room more carefully than normal and the hotel easily ranked 5 stars. Even the floor behind the TV stand and under the bed were spotless. Nice French doors separated the sleeping and living areas and the bath was large with separate bathtub and shower. The staff that I encountered were polite and very helpful. On Labor Day morning I needed towels. They were delivered promptly and the front desk even called to make sure they had arrived. The comforter did slip off the bed easily because of its fabrication. A previous poster had noted this. Another poster thought there was too much furniture in the living room. I agree, I would eliminate the chair and go just with the sleep sofa. The hill that the hotel is located on is steep but walkable unless you have restrictions. The hotel is an easy walk to the Trolley, Gaslamp district, 2 drugstores (CVS and Riteaid), 7Eleven, Starbucks, etc. I did not take advantage of the restaurant, exercise area, pool, etc. The biggest concern that I had after reading many of the postings was the garage. I can tell you that it is quite unique. If you take it slow and easy and pay attention it is not a big deal. You go up a tight concrete spiral for the first 7 or 8 floors seeing nothing but the concrete walls on each side. Then you go through five or so floors of parking ( most with a different traffic flow) to get to the hotel's parking on the 11th floor. Then you take an elevator to the hotel lobby on the 12th floor.

My entire stay was a nightmare and I will never stay here again. I am a starwood club member and when I stay at their family of hotels I always get to stay in their preferred floors with extra amenities. When we were checking in I was told that I will not be staying in the preferred floor which was fine as we were tired from a long flight and just wanted a clean space for my toddler to roam around in. Upon entering the room I immediately noticed that the mini-fridge wasn't working, it actually had a note apologizing for the inconvenience. I called the front desk and they immediately sent an engineer with another fridge. They clearly knew that the fridge wasn't working yet they were willing to put us in that suite as they even had the crib put in before we even arrived which made me question their serivice to their customers. We went to bed without even unpacking and when we woke up the next day, we were disgusted by what we saw. My toddler was running around holding a pack of cigarrettes (we're non smokers). We found several packs of cigarettes in bed side cabinets on both sides of the beds from previous guests. We later discovered beer bottle caps lodged on to the ceiling in the living room. We called the front desk and they apologized once again and promised they'll send someone up to clean those stuff. When we got back to the hotel later that evening, we were surprised to find the cigarretes still in one of hte cabinets. My toddler also found more cigarettes under the bed and I was more disgusted by the level of cleanliness in the hotel. I once again called the front desk, they never once offered to change our room but offered to send the cleaning lady. After waiting for several hours we asked them not to bother sending someone up as my toddler was asleep. The next day while my toddler was napping, they were knocking on the door and called our suite to see whether they can come into inspect the room(after 24 hours of placing the initial call). We usually have a very good experience in Sheraton hotels but we were disgusted at this location by their management and the cleaning staff. Breakfast in the hotel is $20/person for hot breakfast buffet, however, the little cafe on the 6th and B street is fantastic and reasonably priced with friendlier staff.

I typically earn platinum status each year and half of my stays are at this property. It used to be a Marriott many years ago and is an aging property however, it was recently renovated. All of the rooms are the same size so if you travel with non spg member guests, everyone gets the same experience. The people make this hotel work and they are the most hospitable and friendliest staff to meet. I highly recommend you look for Umit, Corneisha, or Linette when checking in. They are the finest star wood front desk persons I have ever met and this is after visiting 213 Starwood properties. The hotel has a club lounge however the guy whom manages it continues to disappoint me in how poorly it is ran. I stayed at the property twice this week and both times it was empty and water was scarce. I know California has water shortages and you will rediscover it applies to their club lounge. In the past six visits to the property, the club lounge was an embarrasment to the hotel name and chain. In all my visits, i have come to know all of the staff except for the guy whom manages the club partly since he is not that friendly. This is not the norm. I recommend you sit at the Skyy Bar during happy hour or in the evening and look for Zach or Jason. Both are very personable and will give you pointers on where to go. If you suffer from allergies, the hotel has Pure rooms that are allergen free and are available. I think you need to request it either when booking a room or when checking into the hotel. I tried it twice and it is good. If you eat at the restaurant you may find the buffet to be boring. I recommend the French toast cinnamon rolls named after Manny in the kitchen or the Renditions scramble. The Renditions scramble is awesome. It is scrambled egg whites with veggies and feta cheese. The chef is John and do not be afraid to aak for him. Unlike then guy whom manages the restaurant, he wants to talk to you and is passionate about food and his creations. He used to do eggs Benedict with crab meat in lieu of Canadian bacon. Five stars to Renditions and a negative five stars for it's manager. When eating there, ask for liberty as your server. She is awesome and I always enjoy it when she serves me. Yes, the plumbing is old. I have had rooms where sink water pressure was less Ghana desirable and believe the hotel is fixing this since I have not experienced it recently. The beds have been upgraded to the sweet sleeper and standard with the brand but the tv in the rooms are still older tube TVs and need to migrate to flat screens. Self parking is 23 dollars a day. I recommend valet for 30. In summary, save your money if upgrading to the club floor. The lounge is small and poorly ran and is more of an embarrassment.

We arrived after 3 pm and our room was not ready. We were assigned a different room that was not on the Starwood Preferred Floor. Upon our arrival to the room we notice that there was not a separate shower and bathtub, which we preferred because we were traveling with a baby. From a previous stay at this hotel we were aware that the king bedrooms did have a separate bathtub. We called down to the front desk to inquire about the possibility of getting a room with two double beds that has a separate shower. The front desk person did not know if the other two rooms, soon to be ready, had a separate bathtub or if these types of rooms have a separate bathtub all together. We then had to go downstairs, get two different keys to go investigate the rooms ourselves. To our disappointment the rooms did not have a separate bathtub, which we then assumed did not exist for a room with two double beds. It would have been nice if the staff knew the layouts of the rooms so that we did not have to be inconvenienced. So, we were content to stay in our current room until I realized how dirty it was. The room was poorly dusted and our toddler picked up candy off the floor and almost ate it. Needless to say the floor was not vacuumed properly. We then called down to the front desk and informed them of the situation and we were then moved to another room. We requested a bellman, but none was available at the time. There appeared to be only one bellman?? We moved our luggage to the new room. Once again my toddler found candy and chips on the floor. I had to thoroughly inspect the entire room for debris left on the floor. There were chips and candy behind the curtains and under the beds. It appears that your cleaning staff does not feel the need to vacuum behind the curtains. Upon my search for miscellaneous debris on the ground we noticed that the box spring of one of the beds was not properly positioned on the frame. We had to fix this ourselves to make sure the bed was properly secured. There were also stains on the comforters of the beds. We then proceeded to unpack and utilize the dresser drawers in the bedroom. One drawer was clearly not on the track and I had to fix it to be able to use it. By the way the drawers are very difficult to open and close. The bathroom was also less than sufficient. There appeared to be mold/mildew in the corner of the bathtub and hair in the bottom of the tub. The toilet seat was not securely fastened to the toilet and shifted when used. The entire toilet also shifted and banged against the wall when getting on and off. The garbage can under the vanity was also missing. Also, just to inform you when the neighboring room started their shower, our shower went cold, but then returned to warm water. The next day we attempted to watch TV and realized that one of the remote controls was missing. We had to request 3-4 times to get it replaced. After our room had been serviced one day we were not given new glasses or our complimentary waters. Also, while we walked to our room one day we noticed the cleaning staff using the floor vacuum to vacuum the couch. This seems to be a practice that is not very sanitary. This makes me believe that your couches are just as dirty as the floors. On the contrary to all of these issues, the valet service was excellent. The gentlemen that helped us were courteous and helpful. We never had to wait for our vehicle when we called down to let them know we were coming.

The bartender mumbled something the wings being frozen, but reluctantly agreed to go to the kitchen and check on the order. Finally, after 40 minutes of waiting the food arrived. Along with the food a manager showed up and tried to convince me that it normally takes this long to heat up chicken wings.

As we were on a budget, I took advantage of Starwood's 20% off spring promo and prepaid for $123/night including taxes. Compared to all other downtown hotels, it was a pretty good deal. I've stayed at the Holiday Inn up the street before, and I think the Sheraton is a slight upgrade in terms of room quality. Room: We got a double queen south-facing corner suite on the 26th floor, which according to another reviewer was supposed to be a larger room... Well... It wasn't very large at all. In fact, it seemed smaller than the non-corner rooms. (We had a view of the Coronado bridge, but even on the 26th floor, the building across the street will be obstructing your view no matter what.) Living room was tiny and overstuffed with furniture. Bedroom was attached to a single sink which had a sliding door to the bathroom. The layout was very odd - the TV was located at an extremely odd angle to the sofa so you really had to crane your neck to watch - in fact as soon as you opened the door you hit the TV. Beds were comfortable enough, though as other reviews state, the double doors hit one of the beds at an odd angle (again, another angle...) so you can't open the doors all the way for more room. Bathroom: A small sink area and closet leads into the bathroom. While clean, it's very dated, small, and cramped. I was tempted to move a nightstand into the bathroom since there was hardly any space to put my toiletries. Service: Everyone was very friendly. Stephanie at the front desk checked us in and was kind enough to give us 2 complimentary breakfast coupons, which unfortunately we weren't able to utilize. All of the parking attendants were also very courteous. The one blunder happened when the extra set of towels I requested never arrived until I requested them again four hours later. Parking: In reading all of the horrible reviews about the parking situation here, I didn't even bother trying to park my monster SUV in the self park lot. The entryway has tons of scrapes on the guardrail, which is already telling enough. If you can find street parking after 6pm on Saturday, you are good to go through Sunday. However, if you can't, the private lots in the surrounding area will run you $22 if you want to park overnight. I ended up going valet for $30 a night, which is ludicrous but it saved me from hauling my luggage up a hill upon check in. (I confirmed with them that they didn't go up the spiral drive way.) Location: $8 cab ride to the Gaslamp quarter, 3 minutes to Balboa Park, very few restaurants around, located on a hill so if you're lazy, this isn't the place for you. All in all, it's a decent hotel if you're on a budget and in SD for a one nighter. It's just not comfortable or convenient!

The beds are extremely comfortable with good mattresses and ample pillows (we usually have to ask for extra). Watch out for the expensive in-room snacks! If you want M&Ms or bottled water go to the 7/11 store just down the street! The breakfast buffet is sumptuous and plentiful in beautiful light, airy surroundings, with an excellent array of hot and cold including smoked salmon, ham, fresh fruit (strawberries for breakfast - wow!), the BEST french toast with maple syrup by the gallon, bacon, eggs, potatoes, cereals and dried fruits, yoghurts, breads and every kind of juice. The staff are all excellent, friendly and attentive and a request for a tray of coffee for visiting family was met from the breakfast bar with a smile and no charge.

Another reviewer mentioned the steep hill while walking the area. Could be hard for some. We liked that we could walk to the Gaslamp area and the views were nice from our 25 floor.

And another time wouldn't cash a check, though their hotel book says they would and then didn't even guide us to the generic ATM they had in a hall. Found it on our own. But we figured it out. Breakfast was too pricey for us this time AT 19.00 buffet and 12.00 regular, but looked like a nice enough place to eat. Agree that the valet parking is the way to go, even if it seems high. (28.00) One less stressor and they were quick to bring the car up. The rooms need to be updated but we had plenty of space; we like the suites. Furniture worn, but clean. Free internet in lobby, about 6 terminals, with printer hooked up. Helped us alot with our plans for the day as we didn't have the laptop with us.

We love this hotel because it is a central easy location, the suites are perfect (if a little crowded) for our family of five; and the indoor pool and jacuzzi are perfect at the end of a long day hiking the hills of the Zoo, Legoland, La Jolla, waterfront, or Balboa Park. It is five minutes or less to Balboa Park and Zoo; 7 minutes to anywhere else in the city. Super nice staff, fresh (I think) lemonade greets you in the lobby every afternoon, coffee every morning. Concierge has discount coupons for any attraction you'll want to visit, so stop there on your way out every day. Best part is the numerous reasonable, non-touristy restaurants within a block or two of the hotel. Owner Jack and his 6th Street Bistro are awesome...great breakfasts, great lunch/dinner menu with super nice staff and a menu with everything you'd want- from burgers, wraps and sandwiches, to fish tacos, to a great pesto salmon, to cajun from the owners native New Orleans (we only ate there almost daily and still didnt exhaust the menu!). Also within 2 blocks- decent pizza, Thai, Greek, Italian, tapas, pasty shop, plus, since it is the business district, there are at least another 4 takeout sandwhich counter type places plus Starbucks. All within two blocks of the hotel. The indoor pool is a nice plus as it is too cold outside in the spring to swim. If going in the summer months, i'd probably consider a hotel with outdoor pool. Otherwise this is a great hotel in a great location. Regarding the parking...suck it up and just pay for the valet. Get a deal on your room and accept the parking fees. Parking in the area is tight so we did the unlimited valet for $27/day. After a long day, we pulled up to the curb, gave the guy our keys, and went for our lemonade!

Convenience - Self Parking @ $22 and Valet @ $28. Word of advice, park on the street and expect to walk, there are private lots available for $10 a day. If staying @ this hotel, it will cost you as much as your room rental or more for parking on weekdays.

Cost - Marketed as a suite hotel, this place does not have the look and feel of a dignified hotel, although the staff tries really hard to pull it off. You have to go to one lobby, into one elevator, and travel to the 12 floor to check in to another lobby and into another elevator. Very annoying. Also, only one entrance and exit.

Valet parking is convenient - but the charges and tipping will drain your pocket - so make sure you have plenty of fives if you are staying there. The valet guys were really nice and helpful and my car was there on time everytime - absolutely no waiting so that was great. If you choose to self park as I did one time - good luck navigating the tight quarters of the parking structure - well worth the cost of valet/tipping - believe me - tight spots! The computer in the lobby with free wifi is really nice - I prefer in the room but I can't bring myself to pay per day - so a break from the room was nice to go to the lobby. I'm thinking next time I'll try another spot in San Diego but overall the Sheraton was nice.", "Date": "July 12, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "1", "Location": "3", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "baltimore", "Title": "\u201cDon't what we expected.\u201d", "Author": "daydr23", "ReviewID": "UR34155939", "Content": "The hotel itself was nice however it did not offer any of the things a nicer hotel should.

On its own merits, as a 3.5* hotel, this property did not match my expectations compared to other hotels of that class. At a deeply discounted Priceline rate, however, it was a good value. There were several questionable design choices in our king suite. The bed was a little too large for the bedroom, so that the bedroom doors would only close if pushed hard to squeeze past the bed. There were no easy-to-access power outlets near the desk. The kitchenette area had a stocked mini-bar but no refrigerator - just an empty, dirty cabinet space where one probably was in the past. Lots of little negatives that added up. The suite also had a mix of 1950's-style elements along with perhaps a partial renovation? For example, the dresser in the bedroom and the overall look of the bathroom were vintage, while the other furniture seemed more modern. In fact, the bathroom looked rather sterile and bland, while the rest of the suite was colorful. Overall, the suite looked sort of odd and disjointed. I was also unimpressed with most of the staff. At check-in, the clerk worked super fast, clearly giving the impression he wanted to get me out of his hair as quickly as possible. In fact, he kept making obvious attempts to end the conversation with me, even though I had several questions about the hotel. In addition, we had two separate one-night reservations and he did nothing to attempt to link them together or even verify the second reservation was in the system. Simply told me to come back to the desk the next day for new keys. We had a late night snack and drinks in the bar area. Food was delicious and service was fine but, again, felt rushed, as it was near closing time. There were several computers and a printer available for free use in the lobby, as well as wi-fi Internet access. While I appreciated the idea, the access was slow enough to be annoying. The location is about 10 blocks from the Gaslamp District. It's walkable on a nice day. On Friday night I found open metered parking on the side of the hotel but did not make it to the car early enough the next morning to avoid a ticket. (Though at $30, it wasn't much more than the parking at the hotel, anyway.) No problems on Saturday night, as metered parking is free all day Sunday. I don't think I'd choose to stay here again. There are plenty of nicer hotels closer to the center of the downtown action. However, I would be fine with winning this hotel again on Priceline.

On the Monday I was there, the area was very quiet at night, but not unsafe. From the 5th Ave trolley stop, it is 3.5 blocks to the hotel, but note that \"A\" St is on a small hill, so there's an upgrade going up. The northern boundary of the Gaslamp District is 5th and Broadway, so it's 5 blocks from hotel. I did not try it, but at least during the day, it may be possible to go up the office tower from \"B\" street to the 12th floor where the two sides connect above the Symphony Hall. That would avoid climbing the hill. I didn't have a car, but saw several garages on 5th and 6th Ave, about 3-4 blocks from hotel, to the north.

Had I known it would be packed (and barely any machines and no hand weights), I may have opted for the gym across the street for $7.50. As a hotel that caters to a business clientele (numerous conference rooms), I found the inadequate gym surprising.", "Date": "October 6, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "2", "Check in / front desk": "2", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "CA", "Title": "\u201cNot a fan\u201d", "Author": "euroUSA", "ReviewID": "UR19970415", "Content": "I'm not picky, I promise you.

The Bad: The fan noise is really annoying. The HAC noise is made worst by the fact that there isn't a temperature control. I can't remember the last time I've been to a 3+ star hotel that doesn't have climate/temperature controls.

Overall, I would say our experience was positive. I think most people would find the accommodations more than satisfactory. If you lean toward the finicky side, you may find some minor discrepancies. Here is our assessment of the pros and cons: Pros: Price: We booked at priceline.com. We paid $100 a night, but feel like we may have still overbid somewhat - especially for the time of the year. The hotel did not appear to be full. Customer Service - We found the staff to be VERY friendly and helpful. We arrived at 10:00 a.m. and were allowed to check in early. They showed us two rooms (one with a corner view and one without) and let us choose. We chose the one without the corner view. The configuration of the rooms made the non-corner room appear larger, although it wasn't really.. Every evening as we came in, we would receive a \"welcome back\" greeting from the staff. Configuration - You basically get a bedroom, a living room, a kitchenette/bar area (although it is just a microwave and refrigerator), a bathroom (with separate shower/tub, and the toilet behind a privacy wall), and a sink and closet in a separate enclosed area. As you can see the suite is relatively large (think twice the size of a standard hotel room). We had a king bed, so there was plenty of room in the bedroom, although I could see where two full size beds would be a little cramped. I liked the frosted french doors between the living room and bedroom. Tow couples or a family could definitely use it - although storage space is a bit limited. View - The hotel is on the twelveth floor, so all of the rooms have views. We were on the 22nd floor. We had a view of the city that extended out to Balboa Park. You could also see the harbor if you turned your head just right. There were planes coming in for a landing, but as other reviewers have said, you couldn't hear them. I think the 24: and 25th floors were for Starwood Preferred Members and the 26th and 27th floors were for Club members, although there there isn't much difference in the rooms from what I understand. Location - Depending on your fitness level, you could pretty much walk to the zoo, Balboa Park (where the museums are) the Gaslamp District, and the docks. You can take a train to Tiajuana very easily. The trolley runs just two blocks from the hotel. Having a car is an added convenience though if you want to get out and explore. Computer Access - There are four computers in the lobby with free internet access. You have to pay for internet access in your room. It was fairly easy to get time on the computers. Sometimes you had to wait a few minutes, but never very long. Facilities ; There is a nice pool, with a fairly large deck area. The pool isn't very big, but what do you expect from a hotel. It is on the 12th floor and has large picture windows on one side, so you get a nice view. The exercise room appeared to be well equipped. Yes, you have to walk across the lobby to get to the pool, but there is also a locker room area and a bathroom for those who are a little more modest. Nothing to complain about. CONS (and all of these are pretty minor): Decor - My wife felt lke the decor was a bit dated. Bear in mind that it was not bad. It looked like the place has been fairly well maintained. The room furniture looked like it had absorbed a bit of wear and tear. They are in the process of updating. Our room even had a flatscreen TV in the LR with great reception. Cleanliness - I'd rate clanliness as 3.5 - 4 stars. It looked like the maid only emptied trash and made the bed. Overall, it was fairly clean, but it didn't seem like they vaccumed, or did a good job cleaning sinks, etc. during our stay. Parking - I have to mention this, since every one else has. In my opinion, \"it is what it is.\" The only thing I would say is to make sure you rent a small vehicle. We had a little subcompact and had no problem, but we did see some people with larger cars struggling to get their vehicles into the small spaces. They would do well to make the parking diagonal, rather than pull in. Yeah it cost $20 per night, but that's what it cost. There is virtually no parking downtown, so that's what it costs. It actually cost us more to park our rental car than it did for the rental fee, but we're glad we had it. My overall assessment is that it is not as bad as others are making it out to be, but we also had a small car. Refrigerator - Well, its not really a refrigerator. It is a drink cooler that doesn't keep things very cool. They will provide you a refrigerator, for an additional fee of $30 per night (no thanks). Yeah, we called them and asked them to come take a look - something I don't think they ever did, but so what? Area: The area around the hotel is commercial. It is about 2-3 blocks from the gaslamp district. So, at night, it can be a little dark and relatively deserted. My wife and I walked back and forth regularly at night and never feared for our safety. I wouldn't recommend a woman walk it alone. There are a fair number of \"street people throughout all of downtown San Diego, but I never saw a problem with any of them - not even panhandling. My personal pet peeve - It seems as though the more \"upscale\" the hotel the less amenities you provide. They had snacks in the room for astronomical prices. You had to pay for in room nternet. Someone said you're even charged for local phone calls. You can go to a Hampton Inn and get all of that for free, plus get a free breakfast too - all for a lower price. Go figure. As you can see, when I'm on vacation, I'm a \"no worries\" kind of guy. Was it perfect? No. But I have stayed in much worse. Life is too short to sweat the small stuff. I would definitely stay here again. That's my story and I'm sticking to it.", "Date": "July 8, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "4", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "San Diego", "Title": "\u201cFor couples or singles - ok.

From the website, it looked perfect, and a suite for the family would be great. Got to the hotel and had a very friendly valet driver valet the car, so for it was starting out great. Now this is where everything just gets horrible. I go to the 12th floor which is the lobby and wait in line to check in. I booked a room with two double beds as i have 5 people in my party, 2 adults and 3 little children. The front desk clerk advises me that they only have rooms with a single king bed available. Now a little irritated i show them i reserved a room with two double beds. Now front desk clerk tells me that apparently on their website they have fine print stating that bed types are just a request and are not guaranteed. However he said he would put in a rollaway bed at no additional charge. So again let me be clear, he told me he has no rooms with 2 double beds available and will give us a rollaway bed at no additional charge. So now i begrudgingly accept the room as i need a place to stay. We get to the room and notice its pretty tightly packed. I have no idea where they will fit the rollaway. Housekeeping comes to the room to deliver the rollaway and then after about 15 minutues of trying to figure out where to keep the bed, tell us that our room is too small to put a rollaway in . So now we dont get a room with 2 double beds and housekeeping is telling us that they cannot fit a rollaway bed in the room. Now im pretty angry and go to the front desk and demand to speak to the manager. Believe it or not this is what he says to me. He understands my anger and b/c of that he will give me a room with 2 double beds. Why couldnt they just give me the room with 2 double beds to begin with ?? He had no answer and then i just couldnt stay at this hotel any longer, so i told him i will not be staying and will not be paying a penny for their horrible service. Another problem, he then informs me that i prepaid (which i did not) and i will get no refund. After getting angrier than i have in my life and 30 minutes later he realizes that we never prepaid, doesnt apologize and we walked out of the hotel and checked in to the embassy suites next to seaport village.

He finally found them and handed them to me without looking up rom what he was doing. Not the type of valet service you would expect for $25 per day. The suite was clean but very small in my opinion for a suite. The room was remodeled but several old fuxtures remained (sprinklers, thermostat, wooden bedroom furniture). Two of the drawers on separate fixtures were missing handles. Some of the wood on other furniture thorought the suite had large pieces missing that had broken off. These obviously had not been replaced during the remodel. The \"sweet\" bed was comfortable but for some reason the comforter kept pullng toward the foot of the bed during the night and fall off completely if you were not laying on a portion of it. The indoor pool and workout room were nice and clean. We used both during our trip and were very satisfied. The restaurant was very nice but had a very limited/ expensive menu. There were no kid friendly menu items so we ventured out to find somewhere to eat in the gas lamp district.

When you finally get to the garage you would figure the hell is over and you can finally park your car and go to your room, right? Wrong! The parking spaces are narrow as well and so are the lanes to drive past them! Anything bigger then a Geo Metro or Golf Cart is going to have a hell of a time parking! My husband managed to park our Lincoln Towncar after alot of stress (still don't know how he did it... I'm impressed!) and as soon as we got out of the car we heard several other people complaining (several of them with small cars). Anyway it was a Nightmare! Then we headed to the lobby to check in... (you have to get on two seperate elevators every time you go to your room!). When we got to the front desk they thought it was funny that we even managed to park and we immediately signed up for valet parking at $5 extra making parking $25 :-0.... Not Including tipping the valet $5 each time he gets our car! (If he is driving it up and down that spiral... he totally deserves more!!!)

Then after being there for about an hour all the awefulness starts kicking in! Two elevators to get our luggage (should have had them bring it... I know that now!). Every time we walked past the front desk (which you will do ALOT since you have to walk past it to get to the second elevator!) the employees were screwing around like little kids! On one occassion I heard them making fun of a guest loudly... totally unprofessional! Then back to the room.... The big blue velvet couch was pretty to look at but when you sat on it, it was very uncomfortable and made a crunchy noise like it was full of newspaper! The desk was all beaten up like it came from a used store! They had food and beverage items in the room that you pay for, which I am ok with but the prices were nuts! $3.50 for a bottle of arrowhead, $3.50 for a kit kat, $3.50 for a little bag of peanuts, $7.00 for a can of beer. Thats all I remember but anyway... nutty prices! The wallpaper was falling off and had a big brown streak across it in the living room (not even curious to know what that was!). The toilet had either a drop of pee or blood on the seat and from there I noticed that the bathroom wasn't clean! When maid services came... was it clean after they came? NOPE! Still dirty in fact they didn't even vaccume (I know because something was still on the floor) and I later found a card that said if you want your sheets changed place this on the bed..... was it placed on the bed before I got there? Who Knows! The sheets were the cheapest most ichy sheets I have ever layed on ($1.99 value at most!), the rest of the bedding was cheap as well. Fancy shampoos and lotions provided? Nope.... Panteen Shampoo and Vasoline Lotion with the Sheraton logo on the other side (good thing I brought better with me! ). The shower had one of those old cloudy glass doors and pink tile and mold everywhere! The shower head leaked badly! The bathroom floor was always wet! When you took a shower in that pink, moldy, dark little closet ... you could here loud trucks driving by on the other side of the wall (I was on the 17 floor). I thought a fridge would be included.... only if you pay extra and request it! This hotel is all about charging you for everything they possibly can! I am surprised toilet paper and pantene were free! Although I wouldn't care to stay at this hotel again.... (I stayed for 2 days) the valet was extremely nice and helpful! The outside of this hotel will impress and so will the lobby if the employees aren't present >:( and this hotel is in a great location! Walking distance from Gaslamp Quarter (which has tons of dining options), Balboa Park, San Diego Zoo, the boat that takes you to Coronado Island and Seaport Village! And only about a 10 minute drive from Sea World. You could almost get away with coming here with no car (would also save you on parking, valet, etc) because there are trolleys and a train nearby.

The bathroom sink was cheap \"cultured marble,\" it definitely wasn't real marble, and there was a crack running through the middle of it. There is no excuse for that at any hotel.

It is only a 2 mile ride to the zoo and parking is free at the zoo if you take your own car. Very easy to get to from this hotel, you didn't even have to get on the interstate. The breakfast in the mornings was nice, it was a large buffet. We got free coupons for us for breakfast. We were on the Club Floor and are platinum members of the frequent traveler program Starwood Preferred Guest, but I think breakfast is free if you pay for the club level rooms. It was very quiet at the hotel. They had an indoor pool and jacuzzi but we thought the pool was FREEZING and the jacuzzi would scald you. A little temp. adjustment is needed and these would be great. Being a suite, it had a living room with a pull out couch, but we got a roll away bed instead because those are never comfortable. We had a little trouble closing the french doors to the bedroom because the king bed was almost too big for the room, but we got it closed in the end. Just have to move the bed a bit. As far as Sea World goes, we were only 6 miles or so from there and went there too (drove ourselves). It is also super close to the airport. We had a neat view of the runway from our room. And, no you could not hear any planes. It was very soundproofed. All in all, a great stay and we whole heartedly recommend. We will be back next time we go to San Diego. I saw the hotels on \"Hotel Circle\" and this is a much better location I thought and a lot calmer.", "Date": "June 2, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Service": "2", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "gloucester", "Title": "\u201cLuxury at the end of our trip, but bad Concierge\u201d", "Author": "divalibrarian", "ReviewID": "UR5230910", "Content": "We decided to treat ourselves at the end of a 2 week trip and the Sheraton Suites lived up to expectations! A lovely room, space to relax and a great view but the pool was tiny!

Also a good location for the Zoo - we walked as the Concierge told us it was only a 15 min walk - it was definitely more like 30 min! Zoo was fantastic (but don't bother with the Deluxe ticket as you probably won't get your money's worth unless you go on the bus rides and skyfari several times) Also, I asked if it was possible to use public Transport to Seaworld and was told no - when in fact you can get the Trolley to Old Town and then the no. 9 bus all for $2.50 each way! (my fiance by that stage was tired of buses and we ended up paying $25 each way to Sea World in a taxi and then another $90 to get into Sea World! It wasn't worth it but if you do go remember to say you have an AA card as they give you a discount). Also a great local bar was the Bistro on 6th Ave corner - Jessie the Bar Manager was a great host and the Cheese Cake was a lovely way to end the holiday!

This hotel is in a great downtown location within walking distance of restaurants, the mall, a grocery store, etc. We reserved two suites with two double beds in each bedroom and a sleeper sofa in each seating area. There was a TV in each area, so that was nice. There was a stocked bar available in the seating area with juice, beer and liquor (can't recall what else) but we brought our own goodies because we had little ones with us, and staff was fine with that. They said to put all of their stuff in the cabinet next to the refrigerator and then replace it at check-out time so that we wouldn't have extra charges added to our bill. The parking cost $25 for valet daily. Excellent service from the parking people and no digs in the van. They double charged us for a suit we had pressed, but quickly deducted the amount when he brought it to their attention. My only complaint is that we'd requested (a week prior to our visit) foam pads for the foldout couches, but only one pad was available when we arrived. Everyone treated us royally from the time we arrived. Immaculately clean rooms and all staff was ready and eager to serve. On the second night of our stay the AC unit wasn't cooling in one of the suites but it was instantly repaired once we reported it (we even received about $15 off of our bill for our inconvenience).

First they ran out of room block rooms so we ended up paying full rack rates. (I had to stay there or would have to taxi back and forth several times each day because I cannot walk a full block on unlevel ground without being in a wheelchair.) The conference rooms were extremely small and cramped. Since this was our first trip to San Diego, we also stayed for the weekend. We paid even more for those two days! Normally a conference rate continues after the conference is over for at least one night. Food at this hotel is outragiously expensive. The breakfast buffet for two, including tip, was over $40. A soft drink and sandwich at the Sky Bar (restaurant was not open on Sunday after breakfast) ran over $45 for two. I travel with a companion who has to help me physically. The handicapped suites ONLY come with one king bed and a sofa bed. The king bed was so high I could not get onto it from my wheelchair and had to be helped physically from a standing position to hike myself up onto the bed!!! The sofa bed was too low. Once down in it I would never get up again. The bed was not only high, but so full of pillows that they took up half the floor in the bedroom when we unloaded them at night. Not too good when you use aids to go from the bed to the bathroom in the middle of the night. The handicapped bathroom was fairly typical and very large. There were two doors one from the living room and one from the bedroom. Because of all the doors it was difficult to navigate once in there. There was no where to put my personal items in the bathroom....no shelves, no flat area around the sink, etc. So I have to carry them back and forth from the bedroom everytime that I went in there. And had to put them on the floor to use them. There was no comfortable seating in the so-called living room--even for regular people. There is only the sofa bed which is too low, the cushons are too soft, and frankly uncomfortable for two people. There was a desk chair. There were no other chairs. We really needed at least one upholstered chair with arms that would allow a handicapped person to get up and down with ease. Or allow a normal person to sit comfortably to watch tv etc. I wrote a lengthly letter to the hotel manager about the problems that I left with my card at the front desk on check out. To date I have received absolutely no response. I am a frequent Starwood guest. I have never ever in all my travels found a handicapped room that was more challenging than this one. Note: the desk staff were not well trained or knowledgeable. However twice we found very helpful informed staff handling the luggage. They gave us info on taxis, directions, recommended selection of restaurants at the Del Coronado hotel, etc. We had a bad experience with the shuttle from the airport. It turns out that this hotel is so close to the airport that taking a taxi is cheaper and much easier. The shuttles involved going up and down in an elevator and over a bridge at the airport.", "Date": "June 12, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Raleigh, NC", "Title": "\u201cNice Stay, Wonderful Bed\u201d", "Author": "TAS-Wine_Drinker", "ReviewID": "UR3278364", "Content": "The beds were wonderful with great sheets and just really comfortable.
