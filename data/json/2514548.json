My daughter and I went for shopping and theatres and general siteseeing. I was born in London so know it well.

The hotel is located in a quiet street about four minutes from Oxford Street - very close to Debenhams Department Store. It is about a five minute walk to Bond Street underground station and very close to many buses which will take you all over the city. We found the room was small but adequate and the bathroom very good. The hotel staff were very helpful and we had no problems at all with the staff. We were pleased to see that there was a full size computer in the lobby which we used constantly. The charge for the computer was 5pounds for one hour or 3pounds for half an hour. They had a buffet breakfast which was included in our package. The buffet consisted of a full cooked breakfast and also continental including fruit, cheese, yoghurts, pasteries, cereals etc. etc. If you would like omelettes they would cook them on request. We wanted cream with our coffee (rather than the milk they seem to use in their coffees) and that was no problem at all. We found the breakfast staff attentive and helpful you just had to ask and they would provide! There were plenty of free newspapers in the lobby every day so you didn't have to buy them. One tip re general travel in London. We purchased London Transport Travel tickets before we left Canada for 50pounds per week. These tickets cost a lot less if you purchase outside the UK. These tickets covered all six zones on light trains, underground trains, trams, buses.and meant that you could hop on and off all forms of transport with ease. It also eliminated the long line ups. You have to request them well in advance from your travel agent as the actual tickets are sent in the mail.

But I was clueless and had to locate the room myself. There was no information on breakfast times in the room or where it took place. Anyhow I quickly showered and changed as friends arrived in the hotels bar, by 2:25 I was downstairs with them. They complained that service for drinks was slow and one of the Ale's was off, badly off and it took a while for it to be changed. I had a larger served in a very old style pint glass last seen in the 1990's and I wasn\u2019t impressed. We headed out for drinks elsewhere. I didn\u2019t return until 1am, there was not a sole around and walked on through, being central London, Oxford Street I would have expected at least 1 person around monitoring who comes and goes with the current climate. Air conditioning worked great as we experienced a couple of warm days even though were in autumn and the tea tray was well stocked. The room was tired but for me, was a welcome place to sleep. The shower was very weak, and was a nightmare to work out how to turn the taps for hot cold, bath or shower, sounds easy but took me a while. No bath mat and the bottom of the bath was very slippery, I am very steady on my feet but I nearly slipped a couple of times, and I noticed could easily crack your head on the massive taps, elderly would definitely have an accident I'm sure. I went down for breakfast and the reception desk was manic, so I thought I would try finding it myself, can\u2019t be that hard surely. I went down a windy staircase near the bar I had seen people emerge from the afternoon before. I could see the breakfast room through windows but the door wouldn\u2019t open. So back up I went and I went down a stairway next to the lift and found the breakfast room. There should be some signs about surely, it was hard to find, especially as I had not been told on reception where breakfast would be. Breakfast staff were very slow, I gave up and went to try find a Tea or coffee myself, and a member of staff said \"what you doing\" I said trying to find a tea, he said he would and he did bring me a tea over. The breakfast buffet was horrendous. The cheapest of cheap sausages, I tried one, and I would put my life on it they are the mechanically reclaimed sausages, they were disgusting. Bacon was ok and black pudding was welcome and nice. Hash brown and beans were fine, mushrooms were tinned and horrid. Some of the items are in saucepans with lids and under the heat lamps these get incredibly hot, as do the plates, we all like a warm plate but these burnt, even with tissue provided. I am not OTT on health and safety but these would be a major hazard if I was to do a risk assessment. One man next to me seemed to of burnt himself when he picked up one of the saucepan lids by the metal handle and he was not best pleased. I didn\u2019t each much breakfast and soon left. This hotel was not worth the money I paid, but if I had of paid a rate of \u00a380 it would have been more reasonable I think. All it has going for it, is its location, it was ideal for me and I may stop again based solely on location if I got a very very very good deal.", "Date": "September 30, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "UK", "Title": "\u201cGreat location, poor service\u201d", "Author": "Casey100", "ReviewID": "UR118626110", "Content": "An average 3* hotel, could do with a re-furb, but clean and confortable enough if you don't intend to spend much time here.

The staff on the other hand, not so welcoming - it doesn't hurt to smile once in a while!

It was a little small but more than met our requirements. One nice touch is that the wardrobe had double wall-to-ceiling mirrors on the doors. The HI had the new HI logo, meaning that it had been enhanced above normal HI levels.

Asking to take a plate where my food is still on is not okay, and they were almost offended when we said \"No I'm eating from this plate\".

They continued to make noise outside our door, however we didn't budge & left our room just after the check-out time of 11am. We paid \u00a3119.60 for the room for the night. A little expensive for the quality of the room but it's London & you expect it. But it did the job, it was tidy, clean & comfy. No frills but a perfectly acceptable place to sleep after a night out in the capital. Would I stay there again? Probably not - there are lots of other 'average' hotels for me to try out in London & I do hate to stay in the same hotel twice-but thats just me.

Key things in favor of this hotel are location and price. While the rooms are a little tired (need refurbishment), for those that come to London for the sights and not the room will be satisfied. First, location is hard to beat. Bond Street tube station is the closest - the hotel is located less than 5 minute walk from there behind Debenhams' dept store. The location is fairly quiet - especially at night when it matters. There are several nice cafes and restaurants about 2 blocks away at St. James Place. While the rooms are not ultra new and modern, there is nothing wrong with them. The beds were comfortable, the room was clean and the shower was very powerful. For those people that sightsee all day and only need the room for sleeping, this hotel is more than adequate. We did not partake of the breakfast or any meals at the hotel. Instead, preferred to grab breakfast at some of the local eateries nearby. A favorite was Cafe Rouge - a little French place that had great coffee, cappucino, tea and breakfast nearby. While it is true you can take a taxi or express train from Heathrow, these options are somewhat expensive (+L30 for roundtrip train and +L30 for one way taxi). We did take the tube from Heathrow as a \"free option\". Since we were purchasing an Oyster Card for the week anyway, the extra fare from Heathrow on top of that was only L2. It is an easy trip, but does take 1 - 1.5 hours so plan accordingly. Take the Picadilly line to Green Park and change to the Jubilee line to Bond Street.

Little interaction from the desk, no how was your journey here? Welcome to our hotel, but efficient (also didn't ask how many card keys I required). Reception area well set out, bar/tourist information by the reception desk. We were allocated a twin room on third floor (room 390), the corridor outside our room smelt of mildew or something similar. There was an ice dispenser at the end of our corridor, which came in helpful for keeping drinks cool. Room was larger than anticipated - and was pleasantly surprised. Probably about 10 foot high walls, plenty of space to move around in. Furnishings were a little tired, and the ceiling paper was showing signs of damage, but all in all a comfortable room. View of private flats opposite (I had requested a quiet room), Good aircon, double glazing and windows opened if required. Puzzled by the fact the room had an ashtray even though it was non-smoking. No mini bar in room, but room did have a safe. Bathroom was small, but a full length bath and good water pressure on shower and bath. Bathroom toiletries more holiday express than holiday inn (ie lux shower gel and shampoo combined in one dispenser on wall). Enough wardrobe space for a couple of nights (small single wardrobe). Had problems with the room next to us making far too much noise far too late at night, but one call to the duty manager sorted that out, which I appreciated grately. Breakfast was OK on Saturday at 945 am, but barely warm bacon. Asked straight away if wanted tea/Coffee, and the pot was on my table by the time I came back from getting fresh fruit. Sunday at 0830 much better. and hotter items. Wide variety of choice, and you can ask for eggs done another way if you don't like scrambled/fried. Evening meal which was included was actually a carvery/self service, starter of salad or soup, main course plenty of choice for meat eaters, (lamb/beef, canelloni, beef pie, beef mince, chicken in a white wine sauce) less so for veggies (1 dish of a stuffed aubergine). You could go back for as much as you like. We went for our meal at 630pm, and there was no one else there, the waiting staff kept their distance, and I didn't feel as though they were rushing us. I asked a waiter why it was so empty and he said it got busier after 8pm. Desserts were not so interesting (cheesecake, chocolate torte, fresh fruit salad, icecream). There is an ASK just around the corner from the hotel if you fancy Pizza/Pasta/Italian. But it is hard to beat the location for the price.

I was booked into a smoking room due to an administrative error on my company's part, but when I asked if I could move to a non-smoking room I was told there was no chance. I found out on check-out day that one of the other attendees on my course who was staying in a non-smoking room had asked, on the same day, if he could swap for a smoking room. My room, at the far end of a corridor on the fourth floor, had a cigarette end on the chair which I found after sitting on it and working on my computer for an hour. There is also a power transformer which was making a loud humming noise 24/7 causing two very restless nights. The food for dinner on the first day was ok... a choice of a couple of nice roast joints in a carvery format - beef or turkey. The beef was great, the veg average at best. Unfortunately, having checked the menu for the evening meal, and deciding on a couple of nice sounding fish dishes, it became apparent that as my meal was included in the room rate, I could either have a helping of the exact same joints that were on offer at lunchtime - somewhat more cooked, or what was referred to as \"The Chef's Specials\" - a choice of lasagna, or \"Spicy beef.\" The \"Spicy beef\" was as spicy as a McDonalds burger, and not quite as tasty, and the rice was crunchy - having apparently been prepared for the start of service at 5:30 and still sitting on the hot servery 3 hours later. The following morning, I was looking forward to a nice cooked breakfast. No such luck! I got a sausage that was 1/3 rock solid, presumably due to being on the servery again for hours before I got it on my plate, a vaguely warm half a tomato, mushrooms that tasted as if they had been cooked in orange juice and soggy hash browns! To add insult to injury, I wasn't even offered a coffee with breakfast, despite a not so subtle attempt to attract the attention of one of the staff I saw walking around with jugs offering other guests coffee. Back in my room, the water pressure for the shower was adequate, but when I tried to increase the temperature above warmish I realised that the temperature setting was already on the maximum. The towel rail, above the toilet, was half hanging off the wall, the safety circuit for the hairdrier had been bypassed and the drier was wired straight into the wall, and the wireless internet access was next to useless.

Totally uninspiring menu, with items unavailable and my mushroom risotto was about the worst example of cooking I've had the misfortune of eating. I was expecting a nice creamy rice dish, with strips of different mushrooms in the sauce, freshly cooked. I got microwaved long grain rice, that had, at one point been shown some sauce before it being whisked away lest it impart some flavour unto the rice grains, with a few bits of mushrooms thrown on the top. Terrible. I'm glad I wasn't paying. I won't be heading back in a hurry. If you collect Priority Club points, much better Holiday Inn options close by are the Regents Park or a little further away the Bloomsbury by Russell Square or Kensington (not the Kensington Forum).", "Date": "March 22, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "3", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Durham, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cGood hotel\u201d", "Author": "PollyA", "ReviewID": "UR14010612", "Content": "My daughter and I stayed here for 2 nights this weekend.

The price is fine, considering the location and high prices for London (I got it for 100 GBP, inclusive of tax and breakfast).

Room was fairly small and a single room means a single bed, which is not what I had expected. Don't expect any interesting views, as the location is a back street and nothing like Oxford Circus, as the name suggests. I paid 12.5 GBP for 24 hours Internet connection, but guess what - as soon as you enter the room - the WiFi signal drops from 100% at the corridor to 0 to 50% inside the room. So I couldn't really connect unless I located the laptop on the floor next to the door, which is not a decent way to surf. Staff was not very friendly or helpful about it. Reception told me they would call me back in 10 minutes, but never called or did it after half an hour. They tried to give me another room, but it was at the smelly smoking floor and it had the same problem.

Hotel itself adequate - 5 minutes walk from Selfridges and Bond Street tube. Small frontage, through revolving doors to find a small reception desk with a bar area to the right. The restaurant is downstairs - small but comfortable but I imagine could be very warm. There is one lift so waits could be lengthy. Our room was fairly good - as there were 3 of us we had a room with 2 double beds - I believe most rooms only have 1 bed. Decor was a little scruffy - paper scraped off walls etc, but clean. Bathroom was tiny but looked as though it had been refurbed recently. Air con was very efficient. Badly let down by staff! The reception staff didn't seem to care about the guests at all. We arrived early, checked in and asked to leave our luggage. The concierge (I assume that's what he was, but he only seemed to appear when luggage was around) told us to follow him to a room full of cases and told us to leave our things in a space. He said we didn't need a receipt. When we returned alte afternoon the receptionist called for the concierge on an intercom. 15 minutes later and 2 more calls we were still waiting. When the guy eventually turned up he again led us to the room and told us to help ourselves - he obviously hadn't a clue which cases were ours. I would certainly not have left our things had I known this. Breakfast was similarly poor service. There was a small continental and hot selection, all self service, but trying to attract a waiter to get coffee took an age, even though there were plenty of staff there. It was the same each morning. On our last evening we needed clean towels, and despite being told 3 times by reception that they were 'on their way' it took over an hour to get them. Our check out was fine, but we had noticed on other days that if more than one party was checking in/out at a time there was a significant delay.
