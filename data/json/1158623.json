The location is on the Grand Canal across from the Piazza San Marco. This area is quieter and has many great galleries and shops as well as being right near the Peggy Guggenheim Collection. It is an easy walk to Piazza San Marco or an even easier Vaparetto ride (water bus)... there is also the traghetto which is a gondola to take you across to the other side. The hotel is the only modern, \"boutique\" type hotel I found in my search and it did not disappoint. Housed in a beautiful old palace, the hotel is thoroughly modern, well designed and comfortable inside. We had 2 rooms which I believe were amongst the smaller rooms but more than ample with oversized beautiful baths. The lobby and dining room are chic and elegant and overlook the canal. Having breakfast in the all white dining room with the canal unfolding in front of you is an experience. The breakfast was fantastic and the service in the dining room was superb. The front desk staff, especially Emanuelle and Mauro made the trip all the more enjoyable by arranging restaurant reservations and for a boat trip to Murano. A water taxi picked us up at the hotel's dock and took us without charge, and back, to the island where we were given a demonstration of the glass being made. Of course the hope is one will buy something and one cant resist buying something even it is a small souvenir item so this is a worthwhile activity (all in under 90 mins)....All the staff were friendly, helpful and would know which keys to give us when we returned back to the hotel. We were with two 14 year old nephews who were very impressed by this stylish hotel as were we....The staff even helped arrange for a special \"thank you\" cake that our nephews presented to us on our last day.

We stayed in a Jr Suite with a view of the Grand Canal in March. It is located on the Grand Canal right next to Santa Maria della Salute and close to the Peggy Guggenheim museum. The hotel has its own dock which water taxis use to pickup and drop off passengers. Very convenient if, like us, you are traveling with large bags. The reception and check-in was very pleasant . The staff were warm and friendly. Being a small hotel they try to greet everyone by name. A complimentary bottle of champagne and plate of fruits were presented shortly after we settled in the room. The room had two small balconies directly overlooking the Grand Canal. The view from the balconies were as good as it gets in Venice. Venice is constantly being repaired as its foundations slowly sinks, there are cranes everywhere and buildings covered for construction. The building across the canal from us was such a case. The suite was very nicely appointed with very high ceilings - 30ft tall I think. Spacious, fresh, bright and modern are words that come to mind. The gold tiled bathroom won me over! WiFi is an extra charge. (Tip: get a Telecom Italia TIM prepaid SIM card for free incoming calls and SMS and 30 days free unlimited internet for 12 Euros). Breakfast is included. The breakfast fare was pretty good and comparable to other 5 star hotels we stayed at. Of course, Italian espresso is excellent. Ask for a complimentary refill if you need more to wake up. In the afternoon, sit at the outside tables on the hotel dock and watch the boats go by, have tea to keep you going until dinnertime - 8pm at the earliest. From the hotel there are three ways to get to St Marks Square: you can walk there in 20 minutes across the Accademia bridge, take a 2 minute/one stop water bus ride from the Salute bus stop, or hop on the Maria Del Giglio gondola crossing service for 50 cents/person. We chose to walk there most days and take the bus back. The walk to St Marks takes you past so many beautiful shops, bridges, canals, and piazzas.

We had been to Venice before and stayed on the Riva, and much preferred this location. I can honestly say that the hotel was the highlight of Venice for us this time. We had booked a deluxe room, but we were upgraded to a junior suite on the corner. They didn't tell us at reception, but just showed us to our room, then casually but deliberately opened the curtains to our exclamations of delight, as we saw a view of the Grand Canal from one window, and the Riva and La Salute from another. Our room was a delight - the eclectic decor, with a white stone fireplace, amazing ceiling, orange walls, and gold bathroom. Great fun, but with a sense of style, and plenty of space. Everything was clean and in working order. I was surprised at some of the negative comments around the time we visited, because we couldn't have been happier. (Well, actually, we could have been happier if wi-f- had been provided free to the rooms. On our 5 week trip we found that smaller cheaper hotels would provide free wi-fi, but in luxury five-star hotels like the Grande Bretagne in Athens and here in Venice hotel guests were charged for it. It seems unnecessary.) Anyway, wi-fi aside (and there is a computer with internet access near the lobby), I didn't really want to leave the room! The views from our windows were constantly changing, and we snapped so many photos out the window at all times of the day. And if we tired of the views, we gazed at the ceiling! We arrived early in the morning after getting off a cruise ship. This was no problem, as the reception staff looked after us, stored our bags, and checked we knew where we were and how to get around. The Peggy Guggenheim is very close, and I recommend visiting it (closed on Tuesday) if you can. In fact, we have to commend the reception staff, because again they had been the brunt of some negative comments. We found them without hesitation polite and helpful. Emanuel was particularly helpful, and when we couldn't get into a preferred restaurant for dinner, recommended another - La Piscine - about a 5 minute walk (away from the Grand Canal but still on the water). We had a delicious meal there, for about half the price of the original restaurant we had tried to reserve (but was closed on a Tuesday). Breakfast at the hotel is excellent, with a broad selection of food and good coffee. Eat out on the terrace (if you can get a table) or in the restaurant itself. We also had drinks and nibbles on the terrace in front of the lobby in the evening - a lovely place for a bellini (though it's not cheap). We arrived by vaporetto from Piazza Roma. Whilst travelling on vaporetto with luggage can be a bit of a pain (evil looks from other commuters/passengers), it is much cheaper than the water taxi, and as No.1 Vaporetto starts at the Piazza Roma, there was no problem getting a seat. It stops at La Salute. You get off, take the small bridge to the right (a few steps, but not onerous), walk through a small alleyway, and you're at the Centurion Palace entrance. Couldn't be easier. We did take the water taxi to the station when we left (booked in advance by Emanuel - give yourself plenty of time for it to arrive), it was about 60 euro, and a fast but entertaining trip. Everywhere else in Venice is within walking distance. I couldn't recommend the Centurion Palace highly enough, and would stay there again without hesitation.

The hotel looked fabulous as we pulled up on the Grand Canal and we felt very fortunate. It has one of the best locations and is one of the most beautiful buildings on the canal as well one of the most photographed. The staff were welcoming and discreet. Our room, although sadly not overlooking the grand canal due to the full occupancy during our stay, was still one of the nicest rooms we've stayed in. It was well equipped and we loved the quirky, contemporary but quality finish. The bed and pillows were really comfy - a rareity these days and in contrast to previous reviews, the supplies were topped up daily, bins emptied and no leaking showers. We loved having breakfast overlooking the grand canal and even though there were only 6 tables on the terrace we managed to get one outside on 2 out of the 3 days we were there. We also enjoyed afternoon tea on the bar terrace watching the singing gondaliers and the hustle and bustle of the Grand Canal. We also enjoyed a romantic after dinner night cap every night on the same terrace which was just idyllic. This experience was enhanced by the warm, attentive and efficient service we received from Elvira who worked in the bar. The location for exploring Venice is perfect - away from the hustle and bustle of the St Marks and Rialto areas but under a 10 minute walk to both via the Accademia Bridge or one stop on the water bus to St Marks from Salute (which is right next door to the hotel) or a pleasant trip up the Grand Canal to Rialto from the same point. We only had one critism which was our room was located on the first floor overlooking the courtyard (which was lovely) but also above the service entrance so we did get awoken everyday just before 7.30am with noise and loud voices delivering laundry.

We had a very warm welcome and were shortly shown to our rooms, the room was quite large and had a bath at one end which was quite unusual. The room had everything we required for a comfortable stay including mini bar, bath robes and slippers and a good selection of toiletries. We found the room to be very quiet at night and the bed and pillows were very comfortable. Breakfast is in the dining room and if you're lucky you can eat outside on the veranda however places are very limited, the choice was extensive and I would say that there is ample for any taste. We found the staff to be very attentive and nothing was too much trouble. The location of the hotel is in a quiet area although it does overlook Grand Canal which is busy with traffic 24 hours a day, the hotel is very well soundproofed and once doors are closed you cannot hear the traffic. We found sitting watching the water taxi's, gondola's, etc passing the hotel facsinating. Much of Venice can be explored on foot, certainly St Mark's Square and Rialto Bridge are within a very easy walk of the hotel and both are a must. We also hired a water taxi to give us a 1 hour tour, the hotel provides a concierge service and sorted this out for us also giving us advice about where we could go and what we should visit. The hotel restaurant is excellent and we dined there on our first evening, everything was well prepared, presented and extremely tasty - I would definately recommend eating here. We also ate out a couple of nights as there is so much choice, if you can book a table overlooking water but you will need to do this in advance - we tried walking out one evening to find somewhere to eat overlooking water and really struggled!

For people who do decide to catch the water bus please don't be put off by the negative reviews regarding distance...it is literally over a tiny wooden bridge and then a further 100 yards to the back entrance of the hotel. No big deal! The room was clean and very comfortable. It was cleaned twice daily with fresh towels each time. Ok there were a couple of cosmetic issues like a massive crack on the bathroom room (plastic coated gold leaf) and the shower screen leaked over the floor but the bed was comfy, big TV, lots of space, perfectly quiet. The thing that really makes this hotel is the breakfast and the outside terrace. We sat out every morning and this truly made the stay in the hotel worth every penny. As far as 5* hotels go (rating is normally based on service, location and facilities) this was spot on and would go back tomorrow! There are far more expensive hotels you can stay in in Venice and I'm sure the floor wont get wet or have a crack on the floor but you will be many thousands of euros lighter!

We spent a long time looking at reviews and trying to decide which hotel to choose and i'm pleased to say we were delighted with our choice. We arrived at Marco Polo airport and purchaced the Rolling Venice card along with a 3 day pass and return airport to Venice transfer on the ACTV. We had no problem finding the hotel. The vaporetto stop at the Santa Maria de Salute church is right beside the hotel. You cross a small wooden bridge and the hotel is just around the corner on the right. On arrival at our hotel we were given maps and local information by the staff and taken to our room on the first floor. Our room was beautiful, contemporary and immaculate. It had a gold leaf bathroom with robes and slippers, a large flat screen TV, very comfy bed and mini bar. We did not have a canal view room but that didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t bother us as we were only in the room to change and sleep. If you want a canal view room I suggest you book one as you cannot be guarenteed one on arrival if the hotel is busy. The hotel itself is beautiful with a lovely courtyard and luxurius interior. Breakfast was served in the dining room and also on the terrace over looking the Grand Canal. Every morning we were lucky to get an outside table. Breakfast was delicious with a choice of fresh juices, water, prosecco, tea, coffee etc. Food included fresh fruit, croissants, toast, cold meats, salmon, scrambled eggs, sausages, bacon\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6.. Everyone should find something they like as theres a wide variety to choose from. We didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t eat in the hotel other than at breakfast, but had a few drinks in the evenings. Drinks are expensive as you would expect for a 5* hotel, so look at the price list before you order, if this concerns you. The hotels location was perfect for us-across the canal from the crowded San Marco but only 1 vaporetto stop away so easily accessible. Its in the Dorsoduro district around the corner from the Peggy Gugenhiem museum with a variety of glass and craft shops in the streets nearby. My husband and I took a gondola ride on our last night which I highly recommend if you have some cash spare, You get to see all the narrow canals, buildings and houses off the main tourist areas. Gondolas are available outside the hotel and along the back streets. Staff in the hotel were pleasant, friendly and extremely helpful, providing suggestions of good local restaurants and places to visit as well as helping us with the vaporetto routes when visiting Murano etc. Nothing was ever too much trouble. They welcome you when you return and even remembered our room number so we didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t even have to tell them when asking for our key! The room was cleaned twice each day, and chocolate and a weather forecast for the following day were left on the pillow-a lovely touch!

I shy away from grand hotels that have a great lobby and service, but the rooms are horrible. The location of the Centurion is wonderful. It's in the quiet Dorsoduro neighborhood, just across the Grand Canal from the busy, touristy San Marco. No need to be concerned about being across the Grand Canal from major tourist sites as there is a vaporetto stop less than 5 minutes away and it's not even a 5 minute ride across. The hotel is easy walking distance to a few restaurants, the Peggy Guggenheim Collection, the Church of Santa Maria della Salute and even a small food market. The view of the Grand Canal from the front of the hotel, including from the restaurant/breakfast room, is spectacular. You can sit with a drink outside in the front of the hotel and watch canal life, or in the lovely courtyard. This is a great, quiet neighborhood to escape the crowds and noise and I had no noise or sleeping problem at the hotel. The doormen, restaurant staff and housekeeping are wonderful and friendly, and the breakfast is very good, whether or not included with your room. On the other hand, the front desk staff are somewhat condescending and cold. For instance, they don't look you in the face when speaking with you, or talk to you as if you're an imposition. I kept thinking I was in Paris. As for the hotel itself, I think that those who give it 5 stars stayed in canal facing rooms which made up for other shortcomings. I didn't mind staying in a room overlooking the rooftops of Venice, which was actually kind of romantic, but it didn't make up for the problems with the room. The room was very clean and the furniture was new and in good condition. There were scratches on the white painted floor, a poorly designed shower that left water -- actual puddles -- everywhere in the bathroom because water didn't drain properly, the shower knob came off, water splashes from the bathroom sink onto the floor -- could this be a hotel theme because it's Venice? -- a very slippery shower stall with no bath mat, and an old shower head that should have been replaced. In addition, the guest services literature left in the room was creased and old, one light wasn't working over the bed, the air could only be controlled by the front desk, so if you wanted to turn it off or lower it, you had to notify them. I passed hefty bags and cleaning supplies in the hallway on the way to the room.

As for the room\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6.. The junior suite we got was in fact a double room with a separated saloon. Our bathroom was lined in gold leaf which already was \u00e2\u20ac\u0153deteriorating\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd and showing clear sign of abrasion.. Amenities not worth to mention. The shower which already showed clear signs of mould was located behind the mirror and you had to climb three steps to get in (and in particular out) which we considered a totally needless and dangerous feature. First impression for a two year old hotel: not well looked after! The suite itself was - let me put it diplomatically - poorly cleaned! I directly stepped into dried contact lenses, there were black hairs on the white floor as well as red wine spots and\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6obviously a blood spot on one of my cushions which was rather DISGUSTING. I complained about all this to the respective manager whereupon he followed me upstairs in order to investigate my \"findings\". He expressed his apologies and the room was cleaned! So, it should not happen once, things are not running smoothly but it must not happen twice. Next day, the room which we left at 10am\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 wasn't ready at 4pm!!!! So I had to complain again and now got some excuses that the hotel had problems with the room cleaning staff and was told one of them was suspended and so on\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6etc. We were offered compensation in form of a dinner or boat transfer back to the airport but had to refuse the offer due to the fact we were otherwise occupied (tax and rest.bookings were made in advance months ago) and of course we were absolutely not willing to gather additional \u00e2\u20ac\u0153experiences\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd.

The king size bed was extremely comfortable and the gold leaf bathroom was a charming touch. The first evening was perfect, but we were slightly disappointed to return the following evening to our Hotel to find scaffolding installed in front of room window for (4) nights. The hotel was clearly undergoing major maintenance issues, so we were puzzled why we offered this room for our stay (or) not even compensated for this visual obstruction, ghastly smell and annoying construction noise.

The hotel restaurant was excellent, especially for the included breakfast. Areas for improvement: As with most higher class hotels , food and drink (including the mini bar) was very expensive - as an example 16 euros in the lounge for a beer and a bottle of water. I ordered a bottle of champagne in advance of our arrival (for my Wife's birthday) and was amazed when this was delivered to our room to be told by the member of staff that this was complimentary. I checked twice and there was even a little handwritten note saying \"with our compliments\". What an amazing touch we thought.and I even went to reception to thank them. However, it seems this was a mistake by the bar staff and the champagne was charged to my account. I have no quibble with paying as at the end of the day I ordered the champagne, it was disappointing though that the information given was incorrect. And finally, at the restaurant on our first night I asked for a bottle of Barolo. When the wine came it was actually Brunello (obviously my poor Italian). I decided to go with this as I had not tried it before, but got a real surprise at the end of the meal to find that the wine was 140 euros.

The breakfast rooms are wonderful with terraces over the Grand Canal, breakfast was to die for , you can have 5 courses if you want including smoked salmon and Prosecco, bacon etc. The staff even allowed us to take more coffee and wine out onto the terrace. I have read that staff in Venice hotels are rude and cant be bothered, totally not the case here, all were charming and helpful, sure the bar prices are very steep which is a real shame because we would have spent all day and night on the bar terrace if we could have afforded to, this may explain why the bar was quiet ,all in all great modern hotel in,a great location, 5 star luxury but without the stuffiness, if you want that pay 200 quid a night more for a room in a more traditional Venice 5 star hotel ( no doubt facing an extractor fan) . Looking at this hotel it does give you that feeling of being exclusive, where people in the know stay - type feeling.

Since this was a brand new hotel- we were aware that it needed some time to adjust. After reading the latest reviews, we feel that we were not alone in our first observations. This trip, we decided to stay at three different hotels along the Grand Canal.. We had been watching the renovation of this building for what seemed years - while having lunch at the Gritti Palace across the canal. We were quite surprised by the interior - as the hotel was designed in a very modern decor- obviously done by some well-known designer. We were up-graded to a suite on the Grand Canal- with two balconies... a perfect location. Unfortunately, the choice of materials and \"modern \" style was a bit off-putting, not because we love traditional surroundings- as we are in the design field ourselves- but nothing made any sense! The flooring was light -made from some synthetic material, which was already showing dirt. The room, painted very dark, seemed crowded- the platform bed was a disaster for anyone over 30- especially when they put out the bed rugs. The bathroom was ridiculous- poorly designed, lined in gold leaf that already was deteriorating. Almost none of the lighting worked ;the only thing that did were the automated curtains... We felt as if we could have been in any hotel in New York City.... Besides the unfortunate design, the service was equally poor. We had to wait for hours before our luggage made it upstairs- we asked for ice and had to call down to the desk numerous times to receive it. The young lady who escorted us to our room was very off-putting in her manner- the one exception was the young man at the front desk. The fresh flowers we brought with us were left in a vase without water! This certainly did not feel like a five star hotel. We do know all of these issues can be resolved, but in the end, it is still a large- overblown hotel, lacking any warmth or relationship to its location. I guess waiting six months to write did not temper our initial response to give the Centurion a negative review.", "Date": "September 28, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "1", "Sleep Quality": "2", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "London, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201coverrated and overpriced\u201d", "Author": "beenthere76", "ReviewID": "UR80633858", "Content": "The room size was barely adequate with a dangerous step up to the bed.

The first room we had, had a rainfall shower but the drain( a narrow gap close to the floor) was blocked so the bathroom flooded. We complained and were 'upgraded' to a junior suite, this time the shower was in a cubicle but the door didn't fit and the bathroom flooded again. When we told the receptionist just smiled and shrugged his shoulders. The junior suite was a duplex, so the bed was up a flight of stairs, amongst the rafters of the hotel. Unfortunately the rafters were also the home of Mosquitos, my wife and I left with at least 50 bites. When we checked in we were just showed to our room, when we checked out the couple in front of us (who were checking in) were asked whether they had been to Venice before, when they said 'no' the receptionist produced a map and talked the couple through all sorts of details, e.g. where to catch the river taxi from, times it ran, what to do if they missed the last boat, where the shopping areas were, places of interest etc. We got none of this, we were walking round Venice almost blind. My wife and I are fortunate enough to travel extensively, and this is the first 5* hotel we have stopped in that doesn't even offer complimentary bottles of drinking water in the room. I'm afraid that this Hotel does not come up to the required standard to have a 5* rating. One last point, although nothing to with the hotel is that Venice was a disappointment, we expected high prices, but many of the buildings are covered in graffiti and the place is littered with cigarette ends.

We decided to splash out on a suite with Grand Canal view and a separate standard room for our daughter, booked through the SINA hotels website at the introductory rate. I had called to check the two rooms would be close to each other, and was assured that they would be 'face to face'. When we arrived by water taxi from the airport, I was slightly disappointed to see that the hotel was clearly undergoing maintenance - the manhole cover in the courtyard was up, with hazard barriers around it, and there was an alarming smell of sewage. Workmen had erected a workbench in the corner of the courtyard and were busy sawing up pipes with a circular saw (rather noisy!). In the passageway to the restaurant, the bar was covered in clear plastic as there was clearly work in that area too. Not a great way to start, though the reception staff were very welcoming and the reception area is stunning. We were then shown to our rooms on the fourth floor Again, the maintenance issues were very clear, as there was a bucket on the floor by the lift and the skirting board of the passageway had been removed - we asked what the problem was and were told that there were some issues with the air conditioning. The suite was stunning, with full length windows overlooking the Grand Canal, 2 small balconies (don't think you could sit out on them - standing room only!!!) and a mezzanine sleeping area. Slightly strange decoration but very luxurious. Bathroom was upstairs behind the bed in the sleeping area - a small bath with shower in it, single sink and separate toilet room (with no sink) on the other side of the bed. Very attractive, but unfortunately the gold leaf finish has really suffered from contact with water in places. You can see why when you start the shower - the water goes everywhere, even if you are careful. But all in all, a very attractive room, with automatic curtains so you can just lie in bed in the morning and push a button to see the view of the canal (and people breakfasting at the hotel opposite). Our daughter's room was at the back of the hotel with only a very limited view out of the back over the rooftops and one window with a view of a wall. Not great but what you expect in Venice if you don't pay a premium for Grand Canal view. Her bathroom was actually nicer than ours, with double sink and far more spacious. Again, the gold leaf finish wasn't holding up well. As we had been told, her room was very close to ours - diagonally across the hallway. The only problem was the key system, as she found it very difficult to open the door to her room - you had to hold the key to the pad and push the door at the same time. The door was very stiff and she found it really hard to get in without one of us to help her. We had a lovely night's sleep in these rooms (very dark and incredibly quiet given the location) and a great first day in Venice - starting with a fabulous breakfast at the hotel's restaurant. We battled for a table outside - there are about six on the deck over the canal, so if the hotel is full I'd imagine you'd be more likely to be inside, which is nice but not really as special as eating on the Grand Canal. Great spread of food and even Prosecco if you're not in a hurry to do anything (we weren't!!). Only thing to beware of is the seagulls - if you leave your table for even a moment they will swoop down and eat your food. We saw this happen to a couple of tables - predictably our daughter thought it was hilarious! When we got back to our rooms in the afternoon, we noticed that there was a puddle of water in the doorway to our suite. It turned out that the air conditioning was leaking. After much consultation, the maintenance team concluded that we'd have to move rooms. We were told that we'd be moving to 2 interconnecting junior suites on the second floor ('at no charge' - 'I should hope not!'). We packed up and the staff helped us move all our things. The two new rooms were lovely - with the same ceiling height as the suite but without the mezzanine. Again, full length windows over the Grand Canal and very luxurious. One was decorated in rich reds and the other in orange (or umber perhaps?). The bathrooms were far more spacious than the one in the suite, and again had the same issues with the gold leaf and a very leaky shower in one. We had to make a dam out of towels to have any hope of avoiding a total flood. Beds were fabulous and curtains made the rooms lovely and dark in the mornings. The fact that they were interconnecting would have made them a far better choice than our original rooms, as we didn't have to worry about our daughter letting herself out of her room and getting stranded in the corridor. In summary, potentially a great hotel - fabulous location (2 minutes from the traghetto over the Grand Canal, 2 minutes from the Guggenheim etc.), great service and spacious (for Venice!), modern rooms. However, I can't see the bathrooms lasting long without a total revamp, and they obviously need to sort out the A/C issues - they had to turn it off entirely for repairs on the morning we checked out, which with temperatures in the 30s outside wasn't ideal. If they sort out these issues I can't think of anywhere I'd rather stay in Venice.", "Date": "July 27, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Park City, Utah", "Title": "\u201cAwesome!
