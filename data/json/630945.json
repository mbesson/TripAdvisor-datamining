The window's are not well insulated there are spaces everywhere and I could hear the people downstairs speaking, walking, shaking the ice in their glass, it was very loud. The closet is a disaster but that didn't bother me. The TV is so old and the contrast is too high so you can't see anything and it can't be changed.

Ask for a room in the higher floor if this bothers you. You could hear some traffic noise in the room but it didn't bother us and we all slept like babies every night. The hotel does not have a restaurant but it has a cafe located next to it. The cafe is Fiddler's Bistro and serves great breakfast. Location of the hotel is excellent and in a safe neighborhood. The Grove is about 7-10 minutes walk past a park - go out of the hotel and make a right onto W. 3rd Street. There is a 7-Eleven next to the hotel to the right. A Coffee Bean & Tea Leaves is next to the hotel on the left. There is no guest laundry in the hotel but you could go to a laundry shop 3 blocks away on W. 3rd Street to the left of the hotel and across the street. The laundry shop is called \"3rd Street Cleaners\" and is a laundromat and offers Wash & Fold service as well.

I thought maybe I misunderstood and asked him who that was - he said Melissa - and he had just met her once when he checked in before.

She talks with you like you're the only person there even though the hotel can get pretty busy. Shes engaging and seems to want to get to know you.

Thursday afternoon the hotel called the number I had given them (my cell phone, with a Sacramento area code) and told me that, since the hotel had sustained damage to several rooms, they would not be able to honor my reservation for that Saturday. I told the person on the phone that I was just across the street and that the earthquake had no impact on this neighborhood, the pictures on the wall weren't even skewed. The gentleman on the phone (who seemed to have trouble understanding me) reiterated that there was damage and that they were trying to get it fixed \"sorry\", then hung up. The other hotels in the area were booked. I walked across the street and they were facing a very angry woman. I was given to a person who appeared to be the owner who again told me that there had been damage, guests had been frightened and had \"all came into the lobby, and I have been here since 2:30 this morning\", and that the last several reservations had been canceled. I insisted on seeing some damage and she took me into an occupied room and showed me a hole -- not a crack -- in the window that looked like it was made by a projectile. I explained that I still did not believe her and I was very angry and planned to take action. They called late Friday and said that they could accommodate us after all. We declined the room. We felt uncomfortable at the prospect of staying there. There are two possibilities. (1) They had a chance for a better booking and didn't particularly mind bumping us. Their ethics are somewhat flexible. They would also have been wiser to plead a plumbing emergency or something like that.
