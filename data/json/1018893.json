Located in the old Bayer AG headquarters, just on the edge of downtown, this new Flemings Deluxe hotel was a pleasant -- but not extraordinary -- place to crash at the end of a long business trip. Although the ground floor of the building is less than impressive, sharing space with some photo-supply store and cracked paving blocks, the entrance and foyer is stunning. The staircase looks like something straight out of an Escher drawing. The old, pre-elevator conveyor lift is also available, as a novel and nostalgic way of getting up to the rooms and back. The terrace provides a lovely view of Frankfurt, and the food was quite good. Also worth mentioning is the small spa downstairs, which seems to have been added as an afterthought -- though it has some very nice elements, there simply isn't enough space or privacy for it to be enjoyed if more than a couple people are there. The coin-operated tanning bed and plastic, modular steam room were hardly up to par for the kind of spa and fitness services 4 and 5-star business travelers expect.The room was good, but nothing extraordinary. Decent mattress and pillows, and very soothing lighting scheme. Unfortunately, the remote-control for the blinds and lights lacks any real clear directions, and more than once I found that the blinds had decided to re-open themselves long after I thought I'd shut them.The glass-enclosed shower in the room was fine -- though it might be a little bit uncomfortable if sharing a room! Overall, not particularly memorable. If available at a reasonable rate, however, this hotel should definitely merit consideration over some of the other business hotels closer in to the river. By losing an U-bahn stop in proximity, you could gain a lot in terms of comfort, and quiet.", "Date": "Nov 17, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR282578487", "Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Business service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "3", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "nycdave"}, {"Content": "Major service-teething problems Nice hotel in very good location of Frankfurt. Since it calls itself a deluxe hotel, one would expect big rooms etc and the hotel doesn't disappoint.The terrace is fantastic, it only lacks friendly and efficient service. We went for a snack and a drink. Waitress 1 was busy preparing the breakfast area and couldn't be bothered with customers, waitress 2 was behind the bar and kept ignoring customers, waiter 1 was overburdended but still had sufficient time to polish the cutlery. We waited for over 10 minutes for the menu. While the reception had informed us that dinner was served till 11pm and we got there around 10pm, the waiter told us that the kitchen was closed and only barfood available, for which we settled. 30 minutes later we leave without anything to drink or eat.After desperatley looking for food, we came back to the hotel before 1am only to realize that they had started working on the floor above us. The constant hammering wasn't particularly conducive to sleep and despite repeated calls to the concierge as well as going back down to the concierge it didn't stop.At breakfast, we complaint to the manger who at least reduced the rate for the room but still this couldn't disguise the fact that we've hardly ever have encoutered such a service nightmare in a 'deluxe' hotel.", "Date": "Sep 3, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR264062331", "Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Business service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "2", "Overall": "3", "Value": "1", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "cfmjust"}, {"Content": "Nice new hotel This new hotel is really nice, I love the rooms, large with a glass bathroom in the room.
