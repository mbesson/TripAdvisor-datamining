{"Reviews": [{"Content": "For a night's stay, a decent option Unlike a lot of Germany, Frankfurt doesn't come covered in brilliant tourist attractions. Still, the odds are pretty good that if you're travelling through Western Europe's largest country you'll end up having to put in at a hotel in Mainhattan somewhere along the line. Of the wide variety thereof, the Hamburger Hof gets my tick of approval.It's just opposite the main train station, so given that I arrived in the late afternoon and left in the early morning the next day, I couldn't have asked for more. My room was spacious and well-appointed, and the buffet breakfast started early enough that I could eat my fill before a long train trip as well.You're pretty well-positioned to walk into the centre of town for dinner, although this walk does take you through the red-light district. It can be a slightly disconcerting sight to see brochures for lap-dance clubs next to those of sightseeing tours near the front desk, but that's the way this place is.Still, don't come to Frankfurt expecting to be wowed by a brilliant city. Most of the place was destroyed during the war, and most of the would-be tourist attractions went that way.", "Date": "Jul 23, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR735687081", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "3", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "Professionalwanderer"}, {"Content": "Too expensive for the price The place is a scam: Don't let them fool you by the nice picture of the big room on their website.

Water was always hot no matter what time of day and the central heating was easily controllable. Sometimes rooms get too hot which means having the window open. As my room overlooked one side of the Hauptbahnhof this was not recommended as the noise in the busy street below was fairly constant. The good standard of double glazing however solved this.Staff were friendly and helpful whether on reception, in the breakfast room or cleaning the rooms which was done daily and well. The breakfast was your standard German fare of cooked meats and cheeses, boiled eggs and really fresh bread along with your normal yoghurts, cereals and great coffee.Location is slap bang in the middle of town, next to the railway station and a 10 minute walk from the Messe. Taxi rank outside and the cost to the airport about Euro20.On the few occasions when there are no exhibitions on then the price will come down dramatically.The hotel is well worth its 3 star category.", "Date": "Feb 29, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR484527566", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "printer066"}, {"Content": "Good Hotel This is a 3 star hotel, and for what you pay you can't have a 4 or 5 star hotel service, room, etc.I have been at the Hamburger Hof on last may during a business trip of 3 days.

After all, it's directly across the street from the train station which we needed to catch very early to the airport the next morning. And it appeared to be a nice hotel. Once in the room, we knew we'd been hoodwinked into what looks like a 2 star room in Paris. This is a pretty dumpy hotel folks. And even worse, they worked ALL NIGHT LONG at the train station on some construction (which I suspect is not an isolated event) and even the sound proof windows couldn't stop the noise from being unbearable.

Of the three or four Main Station hotels where I have stayed the Hamburger is the best.The convenience, price and location make the Hamburger a great place to stay. Literally across the street from the main train station you can be at the airport within a few mins and the ticket fee is a fraction of a taxi fare. Germany is not known for being a friendly place, but I found the staff to be helpful and courtious. The only negitive was the smell of tobacco smoke, which you cannot escape anywhere in Germany.", "Date": "Sep 3, 2004", "ReviewID": "UR377296012", "Ratings": {"Service": "-1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "-1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "4", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "-1", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "PBeard"}], "HotelInfo": {"HotelURL": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g187337-d199336-r18160277-Hamburger_Hof_Hotel-Frankfurt_Hesse.html", "HotelID": "199336", "Price": "$121"}}
