But, the apartment is very spacious and contains a lounge room and massive bathroom with comfortable and large bath. The one criticism I would give is the very expensive price for wifi. It was \u20ac12 for 24hours and we had issues actually getting it free of charge as we were meant to originally as part of the Vaughan town program deal. We stayed here to participate in the Vaughan town program and would stay here again next time we are in Madrid for the program.

I must say I was skeptical, because I read all of the previous mixed reviews from trip advisor and decided to try it out anyway. I really enjoyed my stay! It was quiet, my apartment was very spacious. It was definitely a home away from home. I liked the art deco style. It has a lot of charm and perfect for more than one person. My room was very clean and comfortable. I appreciated the option to include breakfast or not. I enjoyed the breakfast each morning and the staff was very pleasant and accomodating. As for the location of the hotel, it was absolutely perfect! It was walking distance to great restuarants, the metro the bus route drug stores, markets and etc. My friend and I felt very safe. As this was my first time visiting Spain, staying at the Eurobuilding was a great experience. As I am not bilingual, it would have been helpful if the staff, spoke English a bit more. I guess they could make the same statement about me, but we managed to work it out and it was a great hotel, which I plan to stay again.

The Eurobuilding2 is conveniently located in the business section of Madrid. The Metro was only a short walk pobably not much more than 5 minutes away. There are a number of eating establishments in the area as well as a shopping mall a few blocks away. I felt safe walking back to the hotel late at night. The staff at reception were always friendly and accommodating. My reservations were handled promptly and all my questions were answered prior to my arrival. I enjoyed eating in the restaurant on a couple of occassions. I found the buffet breakfast which was not located in the main restaurant was highly priced. The breakfast was not included with my accommodations, however, you have no difficulty finding breakfast a few steps outside the hotel for only a few eruos. I enjoyed the apartment style accommodations. The first suite I had was very large and comfortable, however, the living room furniture needs to be replaced as it appeared to be dirty and worn, so I avoided sitting on the couch., but I loved this suite with lots of room and a nice table in the living area and full kitchen. My second suite the following week was smaller and again very comfortable. This suite presented well with nice furniture.

They sent someone up that did not speak a lick of english and was talking to my boyfriend. I wasn't around. He didn't bring a plug and was trying show how to turn the shower on in Spanish. Which we knew. Don't get me started on the way you turn the shower on. It was ridciously complicated. Anyways after another phone call I got my plug. Then after I took my bath for some reason the water was still running even though I turned it off. Even the maid came and cleaned and left it on so the whole time we stayed the water was running. Also the bed had just one long pillow instead of two.Also they supposedly have internet connection but I guess they were having connection problems when we were there.
