I stayed this time 8 nights in a triple with my family. They renovated the roof top and setting and view was excellent. Breakfast was a generous buffet with eggs, yogurt, cheeses, juice, pastries, bread, fruit, etc. The triple room had plenty of space, was very clean, and the wireless worked great. The pickup from the airport went smoothly although I had to call them when I got there. The lobby was immaculate but the best part of the hotel is its location. It is a 5 minute walk to the bazaar, 3 minute walk to the tram station, and 5minute walk to the Blue Mosque. The staff, especially, Sevgi, Fatih, and Mustafa were very attentive and always smiling and playing with kids. I have stayed at other places in Istanbul but you cannot beat the location and service that the Rast offers.

After checking a few hotels in the city center via the internet, we chose the Rast Hotel. At first we booked only one night, for which we payed about 60 \u00e2\u201a\u00acper person / per night including the breakfast. Because of a bid delay with the plane we wrote an email to the hotel (directly before the take off) that we'll arrive late in the evening and we further asked if it's possible to arrange a transfer from the airport to the hotel. One hotel manager from the service team immediately replied, that everything is arranged. After the arrival in Istanbul a taxi driver was already searching for us and drove us quickly to the hotel, where the staff welcomed us warmly. The rooms are not very big but sufficient and clean. Further our room (4th floor) offerd a lovely view to the mosque and free wi-fi. Anyway the location of the hotel is wonderful. It's very close to all the most important places and attractions of the city, so that it's possbile tto reach all places by walking in 5 minutes (blue mosque, hagia sophia, grand bazaar, etc) or 20 minutes (galata bridge, spice bazaar, palace, etc) up to 30 minutes (galata tower). The breakfast is small but nice and the staff is very helpful and welcoming. The view from the terrace is simply wonderful and impressive - a very good place to enjoy a cappuccino or tea and some sweets. According to all our first impressions we decided to stay all of our 'Istanbul nights' in the Rast Hotel and extended our booking for the same price. In reference to this, the hotel gave us one transfer to the airport for free. All in all we enjoyed Istanbul and the hotel very much.

The hotel was ok, cannot see that it could be described as 'boutique' more baroque. Staff were very welcoming and seemed keen to please. Room (405) was small, bathroom smaller still as it had been shoe horned into the corner of the room. Bed was exceedingly hard and pillows lumpy. Despite a request for the AC to be switched on the room was uncomfortably hot at night necessitating the us to leave the balcolny door open with consequent street noise and audible calling to prayers. Needless to say not much sleep. Breakfasts were a selection of usual hot and cold, nothing especially well or badly done. Sunday breakfast was ruined with the arrival of 30 or so male day guests. Despite a long table being set up on the terrace for them they used just about every inside table, swept through the buffet like a plague of locusts and then were waited on hand and foot whilst all the other resident guests had to wait for further supplies to be brought up from the kitchen. One couple did not even have a table to sit at and perched on a banquette with a low table to eat their breakfast. We like another couple of guests had to vacate before supplies were replenished as we were being collected for an escorted trip. To add insult to injury having been summonsed to reception we didn't leave for another half hour by which time most of the day guests had dispersed. The hotel is not bad, but could do with a bit of updating. Have to say the one thing I think they should make a bit more effort with is the upstairs terrace overlooking the Blue Mosque and Hagia Sofia. The views are tremendous, but there is nothing to keep you up there, the cafe is completely inadequate, a request for 2 diet cokes took ten minutes and then a further ten minutes to get some ice. We only discovered they had a restaurant by accident, but was disappointed to discover it only served fish. Genuinely feel they are missing out as so much more could be achieved with this asset, all the bars and restaurants in the area had outside heating comfy seating and ambient lighting.

Our room was clean but the beds were very firm and the air conditioning kept reverting to 30C no matter how hard we tried so we had to use the balcony door as our aircon!

We wanted to stay close to the main attractions and travel around using public transport. Having searched online and taken soundings on Tripadvisor, this seemed as good as any in Sultanahmet. We were going to be using it just to sleep anyway so it was not a case of wanting too much in terms of comfort and services. The hotel itself is a relatively small (around 30+ rooms) outfit with slightly dated facades and traditional turkish furnishings. The room we got was much smaller than we expected but as previously stated, this was fine for us as it was just a few days. On arrival, we were provided with welcome tea abd biscuits and the receptionist made the effort to ensure we knew how to navigate around the city and the best ways to maximise our trip. This was a nice touch. There was free wifi and breakfast as advertised. The breakfast was just OK - nothing to write home about. There were no great expectations so we were not disappointed. Of the hot drinks tried, the hot chocolate was probably the best option and is recommended. Staff at breakfast - just like the other staff in the hotel were all very keen to please and I could not fault their service in any way. The views from the 6th floor restaurant were quite spectacular - 180 degrees of the city. The room itself was quite comfortable with temperature setting controls. Unless you are staying at the front of the hotel, do not expect much of a view. The upper floors at the front have views of the 2 famous mosques. The lighting in the rooms leaves a lot to be desired. In my opinion, the total wattage (even when all 3 lamps are turned on) is less than reading quality. While I am all for energy conservation, the hotel may want to look at making the reading light a bit brighter - even if the others stay the same. Again, for a short stay, no issue.

The free transfer from the airport to the hotel was punctual, and the concierge was excellent in advising about sightseeing, taxis etc. We were very happy with our stay here, however, guests should be aware this hotel is 'dry' (i.e., no alcohol is served), which was disappointing as the view at night from the rooftop restaurant is beautiful, but we like to have wine with dinner, so we didn't repeat the experience after the first night - this should have been made clear in the hotel website. However, the hotel is an excellent, economic choice when staying in central Istanbul. We were impressed to find that Istanbul itself was very clean, with little litter or graffiti (unlike Athens!) and the public gardens and water fountains were beautifully kept, definately a 'must see' city on any European tour.", "Date": "March 29, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Tetbury, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cCouldn't be better.....................\u201d", "Author": "CNHoward", "ReviewID": "UR101643544", "Content": "Couldn't be better, for location service and comfort.

We could have no complaint at all about the service. They gave us a great recommendation for a nearby restaurant (Sir Evi). Wasn't as keen on the second recommended restaurant (Hos Seda) but no big complaints. Room was comfortable & well equippped. Great view from the breakfast room on the roof terrace. Pity that the hotel doesn't have an alcohol licence but there are dozens of nice bars and cafes within 5 minutes. Definately worth a go is the rooftop bar at the Pierre Loti Hotel (in the street behind the Rast, just round the corner)......you can sit and drink in a nice atmosphere whilst taking in the floodlit skyline of Istanbul (another great recommendation from the Manager at the Rast) All in all, we can highly recommend the Rast and thank the management & staff for a great stay!

When we arrived at the hotel we were assigned a room that was already occupied. The obviously embarassed porter went back down to the reception desk and found we were meant to be in a different room on another floor. We had booked a room with a king size bed but the room we were assigned had three single beds. I spoke to the reception desk and was told there was nothing they could do about it and maybe in three or four days they could change our room. I said that we had been charged and already paid for a room that we were not being given and he said he would make a note of it for the morning staff. As it was near midnight and we had travelled for many hours we had no option but to take it for that night. The following morning, Monday, I went to the reception desk and explained that we had not been given the room we had booked and paid for. They were unaware of this so it seems that the night porter made no note as he said he would. They reluctantly changed the room and said they would move us to the type of room we booked and that they would move our luggage into the room when it was ready while we went sightseeing for the day. When we came back in the evening our room had been changed but when we went in our luggage was nowhere to be seen. I went down to the reception and there seemed to be confusion over who was supposed to be moving it. After several calls to various people and searching the room we first had and the left luggage room by reception, it turned out after about a half hour of searching that our luggage had been left in someone else's room. The room we were given was clean and comfortable and very well equipped and I was happy with it. On Wednesday morning we were woken early by a wake up call that we had not requested. I explained this on the first call but they still called back twice more. We had to be at the airport for 9am on Friday morning so on Thursday evening I arranged a transfer from the hotel to the airport to ensure we would be on time. However, when I arrived at the reception for my transfer they were unaware of it and the driver was at the airport collecting other guests. I got the receptionist to order a taxi which turned up aboout three minutes later. The hotel is very close to many of the main sights that are within easy walking distance. The view from the rooftop breakfast room is excellent and for photographers there is a good view of the Blue Mosque and the Haigha Sophia as the sun sets. There are many restaurants on the street close by but the food is fairly mediocre. However, the section of the Ticarethane Sok just off Divanyolu has the better restaurants in the area, I would particularly recommend Evim and Rumeli Cafe. I enjoyed the city and the sights but the only negative part was the confusion there seemed to be in the organisation in the hotel itself. One of the most annoying things with the litany of mistakes made was that at no point were we offered an apology for any of them.", "Date": "September 21, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "bristol", "Title": "\u201cFantastic location - good views and handy for sights\u201d", "Author": "quizzer43", "ReviewID": "UR79549674", "Content": "Chose this hotel because of the terrace cafe's view of the Blue Mosque.

There is never a dull moment at the Rast. I felt completely comfortable with every member of the staff, and they were always delighted to accommodate to mine and my father's needs. We were both blown away by the view from the breakfast terrace upstairs, and the food served every morning is INEXPLICABLY DELICIOUS. The Rast was more than just a hotel to us. We got to know the staff on a personal level and continue to stay in touch with them as individuals after our stay had come to an end. I became so close and friendly with the staff, that I was even given the opportunity to give and receive relative language lessons with some of my new friends from the staff. It was a delightful experience and we are undoubtedly returning. We have certainly convinced many of our friends back home to not only visit Istanbul, but to highly consider staying at the Rast. It is reasonably priced, luxurious, cozy, and a place where I, in all seriousness, felt at home. The location is incredible, as well. My father and I did not take any form of public transportation for the entire duration of our vacation. Everything was in walking distance, and members of the staff were incredible enough to take us to exclusive shopping districts on THEIR OWN TIME! They truly care about their guests and treat them with the utmost respect and consideration. Leaving the Rast was emotional, because in all honesty, we were leaving our friends, as well as the cultural capital of Europe. However, we will see the Rast again shortly!

Good restaurants are located nearby down the hill towards the Aya Sophia - I recommend Mozaik and Khorasani (www.khorasanirestaurant.com). Helpful tips:- Turkish bath - try and go in the day when it is quiet. Women are given knickers to wear and that is all people tend to wear, no need to take a swimsuit. The scary ladies in their bikinis tell you what to do so dont worry if you have to go in on your own! Arasta Bazaar - is a more pleasant shopping experience if you are looking for better quality goods than the Grand Bazaar. Handbags - amazing fakes, but make the decision before you go as to whether you are going to go for an expensive leather version (worth it) or a cheaper plastic version. Kucek Kose in the Grand Bazaar is good. Topkapi Palace - I personally think the extra payment for the Harem is a rip-off - dont bother you will see enough to keep you happy. You will get the living daylights harassed out of you by touts/vendors, but they mean well and can be highly amusing.

As we had arranged, my husband and I were picked up at our ship's dock and driven to the hotel. (Only a 5 minute wait) Our driver Sardak was wonderful. He was the same driver who took us to the airport and made sure he was there 15 minutes ahead of schedule. Given our four night stay, both transports were free. Since the hotel was full the first night, it had been arranged prior to our travel that we would stay that night at the Golden Horn. (Only a few blocks away) It was nice to have two hotels to compare!. Despite the fact that the Golden Horn had a fabulous breakfact, as compared to the mediocre one at the Rast, I'd pick the Rast any day. Our room, 403, was spacious, had a desk and chair, a small terrace (about 2 feet by 4 feet) and a bathtub. (Some rooms have just showers and there seems to be various configurations per room) The bathtub is high and one had to be careful navigating in and out. The beds, while not the softest, were a far sight better than many I have stayed in and definitely softer than the ramrod hard bed at the Golden Horn. The front desk staff was wonderful and all too eager to help. One night, we went to see the Whirling Dervish show and asked for directions. Next thing you knew, they drove us there, for free. Tarik and Happy were happy to supply information and advice. While the staff may not be up to speed on the computer, I was grateful there was one available and there for customer use. (Some hotels charge) Again, if it weren't for their help, we would have had difficulty. While I wasn't thrilled by the wait-staff that serviced the beautiful terrace, which had both indoor and outdoor service, I would put that aside in favor of the overall picture. One got the impression that they are trying. It's not the Four Seasons Hotel (which by the way has a FANTASTIC Sunday brunch) but then again you are not paying Four Seasons prices.

The hotel provides a driver who greeted us at the airport at 5:45 a.m. He was professional and pointed out several interesting sites along the drive to Istanbul. Upon our arrival at the Rast, we were warmly welcomed by the desk clerk who advised us that accommodation was available for our early check-in. While we waited for the keys, he gave us suggestions and brochures to help us make the most of our limited time in Istanbul. We were shown to a spacious third floor room with three small single beds separated by nightstands. When we booked, we were made aware that no double rooms were available. The modern but small bathroom housed a shower, attractively arranged toiletries, a hairdryer and slippers. Additional amenities included a safe, a mini-bar containing water and soft drinks and a balcony that overlooked the street at the front of the hotel. The room could have done with better lighting as there is no overhead light fixture and the lamps cast a dull glow. There was a bit of a noise problem late at night that was easily remedied by closing the balcony doors and turning on the air conditioner. Both the air conditioner and open doors helped to dispel a musty odor in the room. There is a lovely wide stairway leading to each floor; unfortunately it is not well lit. Motion detectors that don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t always do the job and sometimes left us in total darkness control the lighting. Since there is only one elevator in this six-storey hotel for both staff and guests, sometimes using the stairs was the only option. Breakfast was adequate. Choices included various fruits and vegetables, cakes, bread, two hot dishes, coffee and juice. The coffee was strong and flavorful; the juice was watery. The view from the rooftop restaurant was spectacular and encompassed the Blue Mosque and Hague Sofia. The location of the Rast Hotel is perfectly situated; it is a two minute walk to the restaurant/caf\u00c3\u00a9 area, less than 10 minutes to the Hague Sofia and the Blue Mosque, and the about the same for the Grand Bazaar.

A short list of the things we found lacking: unreliable cleaning service (towels one day, NO towels the next!), soap dish removed from the room on our 2nd day (?), no garbage can in the main room, extremely tiny bathroom with no electrical outlets, spotty wifi service, very hard bed -- like sleeping on a block of wood -- with no blanket, just a sheet and that bed cover thing that people always toss on the floor. Two other things: -- We returned to our room one day to find that it stank of sewage. It was a bit of a mystery because the smell was not coming from the bathroom, from the AC vent or from the outside. It disappeared after a couple hours, and we still don't know what it was. -- Our room was on the 5th floor, the hotel restaurant is on the 6th floor. Breakfast service is incredibly loud -- chairs being pulled out, pushed back in, the sound of cutlery, people moving about. The view from the 5th floor is great, but I would not recommend it because of the noise. We did like the restaurant and the restaurant staff is very nice. The view from the roof is breathtaking and the location of the hotel is ideal for visiting all the big sites: Topkapi, Blue Mosque, Grand Bazaar, etc. Despite these great advantages, the hotel does not live up to all of the hype.

The cab was waiting for me, however I had to pay with cash rather than be able to add the amount to my hotel bill which was slightly annoying. The hotel is ideally situated around 5-10 minutes walk to Haghia Sophia and the Blue Mosque in the old town. The Breakfast terrace on the top floor is spectacular! This is one of the best views I've ever enjoyed over breakfast and is the major reason to stay at this hotel. The buffet breakfast is ample and enjoyable although the hot food options are rather limited. The terrace would make a great bar, however it is deserted after the evening meals finish at 22.00, which is a pity. My room was nice and clean however the bathroom was tiny. Although cleverly planned, the bathroom was not really large enough for the double room that I had. Everything else was clean though and the mini-bar and safe were useful features. The one major negative I had though is that I did not sleep well on either night due to street and room noise. I could hear one room guest clearly shouting about a football match next door and then him returning back later at 3.30am. Car horns were also going off every so often which was not conducive to a good night's sleep. All in all this is a really nice hotel though and the roof terrace and location are really excellent with all the staff also being very helpful and courteous. The noise from the street and adjoining rooms though is something to bear in mind if you have an early morning start the next day.", "Date": "September 18, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Bay Area, California", "Title": "\u201cGreat Location & Million dollar View!\u201d", "Author": "JNTC", "ReviewID": "UR42485884", "Content": "At the time of our stay, the hotel opened only 3 mos prior. So everything was still new. Can't say enough good things about this hotel except that if you plan to visit Istanbul, I can't think of a better hotel to stay in. Tops even the Ritz. The front desk manager [day shift] even took the time to plan out our entire 4 day stay and offered tips on which sites to see first. - Located in the Old City district [which is where all the main attractions are] - It's off the main road which is perfect 'cus it offers both peace & quiet and also easy access to all the sites. - Walking distance to the Blue Mosque, Hagia Sophia, Underground Cistern & Topkapi Palace. - 10 min. tram ride to Spice Market & Grand Bazaar - Rooftop cafe at the hotel offers a million dollar view from its terrace: Blue Mosque, Hagia Sofia & the Bosphorus Bridge which links 2 continents [Europe & Asia]. - Breakfast included - Free internet access from hotel lobby [2 stations available for use] - Entire hotel staff was extremely friendly. - Try to have the hotel arrange your taxi services to avoid being ripped off.
