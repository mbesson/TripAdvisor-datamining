We booked through Expedia with a flight & hotel package and was very pleased with our whole experience. We stayed at Stay Waikiki in a bunk bed room for 5 nights and have nothing but good comments. Now they weren't lying when they called it a boutique hotel, for it is very small, in fact our room was similar to a large walk-in closet but it was decorated nicely and had a small balcony that overlooked the city and a small part of the beach. Pros: - The price! - The comfortable lobby, including the best swinging chairs I have ever sat on! - The free amenities, including: inflatable floatation tubes, boogie boards, free DVD & PS2 games rental (PS2 comes with every room & flatscreen), wifi, pastries & coffee in the morning, etc. - The GREAT location. I'm talking a block away from everything! Waikiki Beach, the main restaurants, rental services, and since you are right behind the Hyatt all shuttles to Luaus, tours , etc pick you up basically from the Stay lobby! - The extremely helpful staff! Cons: - The room was tiny, but the decor made up for it and I mean, you're in Hawaii, why are you staying indoors?! - The large Hyatt blocking your beachfront view. *Some people complain about the noise, but it was not that bad. And the windows can be fully shut, but once again, it's Hawaii, let the ocean breeze flow in!!! Even at night.

As the title says, it is what it is. It seemed to be an apartment block turned into a low price hotel / motel, think of it like business class for a backpacker. Dont expect luxury, its not what your paying for. The rooms are big enough (queen bed on 7th floor) although the bathroom is small but even at 6'6\" it wasnt a big deal for me. If you want ocean views from your room dont bother, just walk 100m to the beach. PROS: The location is excellent and only a street back from Waikiki Beach, not even 100m away. Theres air con, a balcony, a bed, a tv, a playstation, wifi, a shower and a toilet. Staff were pleasant and helpful. The lobby is welcoming. The self service laundromat downstairs was very handy and something the bigger hotels could benefit from. CONS: Street noise that other reviews mention was noticeable, but i felt it was drowned out by the air con. Without refitting the entire hotel with new windows the noise will always be a problem for some. The curtains could be better and are about 60-70% efficient, but on the flip side Hawaii is a beautiful place so worthwhile getting up early anyway to take a stroll. No fridge in the room for cold drinks and snacks. TV placement would be a problem for some but a room for me on holiday is a place to sleep. Room wasnt ready for check in until 4pm, but we were able to sleep in the lobby on the comfy couches anyway and guzzle a couple beers purchased from the local ABC store, not so bad. OVERALL: Great value for money. Would happily stay again, you get what you pay for.

Not, not really. But for our purposes of having a place to crash after a day of hiking and exploring Oahu, this place was perfect. Similar to what some people have said, the rooms can be a bit small but we were lucky enough to be upgraded to a larger room for our two nights there. Score! I will also verify some of the other comments people have said: it is indeed next to a budget hostel which could be noisy. We were there just after Spring Break so the place was empty and not really an issue for us. The early morning garbage trucks are real and will show up 6 am or so like clockwork. The windows are glass slat types that will keep water out but not much noise. Depending on your expectations of a hotel, these things may bother you but for the two of us, they were non issues. We both slept with earplugs, making all of these things a non factor during our stay. One other thing of note is that the bathroom was on the interior of the building so all the steam from your shower would have to escape out into the room once you opened the door. I am always puzzled by places that don't have a fan or put the bathroom with small window to the outside to let fresh air in. All of that stuff said, it was an absolute steal for what we paid (we did a bundle with a car from a main travel site that was wayyy cheaper than booking both separately). We did have a car rental as well, which we parked about 3 blocks away at Hotel Banyan for $10 per 24 hrs with in/out privileges. There was a sign up that this was increasing to $12 effective June 1st 2012. The 3 block walk didn't bother us but if you have limited mobility or kids, walking back to hotel may bother you. Breakfast is white bread, unfrozen muffins/pastries, jam, juice and coffee. You don't want to fill up on the stuff but it will let you eat something before you begin your day, which is convenient. Service was great, with each staff member being super nice. There is an ABC store about 3 doors down for late night drinks and munchies, a Mexican restaurant that has happy hour about 5 doors down and the beach is about a 2 minute walk from the place. Can't really complain about the location as it was pretty much perfect. I can see how if you're here at the wrong time of year, this place would be brutal.

Really, we weren't looking for a regular \"hotel\" - we just needed a place to lay our heads at night (who spends a lot of time in their hotel rooms anyway when you are in the most beautiful place in the world?!). Stay Waikiki fit all of our criteria: helpful staff, modest yet clean rooms, great location, and a fantastic rate. No suites were available when we booked, but we got a double room for $89/night, plus a $10/night resort fee, which includes free newspapers, free breakfast (pastries and coffee and juice), free wi-fi internet and use of printer, and free DVD rentals. Also, the hotel has plenty of beach toys you can borrow, ranging from straw beach mats to boogie boards. People of all ages - traveling singles, young families, and older couples - stayed here during our 2 nights, so this breaks the mold of being a \"budget\" or even \"dorm\" lodging. The room: bed was comfortable for two, we had a mini-fridge, plenty of storage room, a breakfast table and sofa bed, and a small (clean, but badly in need of an upgrade) bathroom. The wi-fi works great in the room. We only got 2 towels total, but there is maid service daily which will replenish your supplies. Downsides: we could hear entire conversations coming in from the vent in our room from some other room (I think from right above us, it was difficult to tell) and there was a huge gap in between our door and the floor (as in, 2-3 inches space). No bugs or anything got in, but still, a bit off-putting. I wouldn't stay here for a long period of time, but for a couple of nights, Stay Waikiki really fits the bill.", "Date": "May 29, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "2", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Bonsall, California", "Title": "\u201cBare Essentials\u201d", "Author": "Michael L", "ReviewID": "UR130242761", "Content": "Pros: 1 block from Waikiki beach and shopping.

We choose this hotel because it looked like a cool, trendy, contemporary place! Plus it describes itself as a \"boutique hotel\". But it seems that every hotel which has contemporary & trendy furniture (Ikea) and less than 50 bedrooms can call itself a \"boutique hotel\". However if you find a dirty and filthy carpet in your bedroom, a not up to standard cleaned bathroom, floor and furniture\u2019s you WILL question the description named above. The room and the hotel itself felt more like a hostel, rather than a hotel! The staff at the front desk were friendly, however not very well trained or confident. Also it felt that they did not want to go the extra mile to make their guests feel 100% comfortable. This is why after listening to a conversation the receptionist had with another guest while waiting to be served we decided not to bother with \"feedback\" about the room and our \"discomfort\" as we thought that there wasn't much they can or want to do about it anyway. I guess because this hotel does not have a lot of returning leisure guests as most of them are tourists visiting from all over the world, and \"Stay Hotel Waikiki\" doesn't strike me as the place to hold functions, conferences or to be attractive for business people, the interest in keeping every customer happy didn't seemed to be top priority. We paid $10.00 per night amenities fee, which includes breakfast, wireless internet, use of the guest computer, comp. newspapers available in the lobby and coffee served (help yourself service) throughout the day. Ok, it is what it is and even if we didn't want to make use of any of this we still had to pay it. The breakfast was \"served\" on plastic plates and cutlery in the lobby on two tables next to the elevator and included toast, jam, butter, Danish & tea/coffee, with seats available (or not) in the lobby. We couldn't find the restaurant/bar. However two blocked of doors where we were able to store our luggage and looked like a building site is probably where it will be eventually once it's finished. The good thing about this hotel is its location, just one block away from Waikiki Beach and close to bus routes going into every direction. The bad thing is the noise...but we were well aware that if you book a city center hotel, you will not get a lot of sleep, so NOT really the hotels fault.

Stay Waikiki had an Expedia deal for a $90 a night room with bunk beds, so I went with them. A couple issues I had: 1) parking - there is VERY limited parking available at the hotel, and the staff said that there was $8/night parking available at the adjacent building. The actual price for parking had changed to $20/night unbeknownst to the staff, so I had to correct them. 2) room - I've stayed in some cramped rooms before, but this was one of the smallest I had ever seen. The bunk bed was also very cheap, like used dorm furniture. 3) fees - there is some kind of $10/night fee for. . . I don't know what. I noticed a warning for it after I booked the Expedia deal, so I think Stay should just put it in the base price of the room 4) loud - the walls aren't well insulated and this is one of the noisiest parts of Waikiki due to buses and service trucks pulling in behind the Waikiki Hyatt Regency, so it was pretty noisy all night Otherwise the hotel was fine and served its purpose of giving me a place to crash. The room was very clean its VERY close to EVERYTHING in Waikiki, so you won't be at a loss for places to eat or things to do.

Consider it like a well-runned Hampton Inn... except in Waikiki. Please note that I'm basing the experience on the upgraded room. ++++ Staff is very attentive and personable. Way better than staying at a 1,000 room resort, where nobody knows you. Responded to clogged tub drain issue immediately. $10 resort/ day fee is fair and gives you internet (works about 80% of the time), dvd rentals, and use of beach mats, chairs, floats; daily newspaper; (typical) continental breakfast of juice, coffee, toast, and pastries; a business area, so you can print boarding passes, use the internet. Very close to the Beach. You're smack right in the middle of the Waikiki strip. 10 minute walk to the zoo, one way and 10 minute walk to Beachwalk (Lewers) the other way. Restaurants are plentiful nearby. I prefer that small hotel buildings don't have restaurants, because I may be stuck in the room right above the restaurant (you can hear the noise and smell the kitchen.) Very convenient to the bus stops. We take the bus everywhere when we stay in Waikiki. Laundry facilities available - wash is only $1 and 45-minute dry is 75 cents. - - - - If you're a large-sized person, the bathroom may be an issue. It is tiny... like 15 SF. (You can wash your sandy feet while you're sitting on the toilet.) We're not large, so it worked out okay. And who hangs out in the bathroom? Couldn't quite figure out if hotel is being \"green\" or staff just forgot to make it to our rooms and get us new towels. We usually fix our own bed, and re-use our towels (because that's what we do at home), but it was stretching it a bit, when all towels got used up (because we went to the beach) and trash bin was overflowing. For those who complain about noise... you're in the middle of Waikiki, which is a very popular area. You can stay at the Royal Hawaiian for $350 - $400 per night if you want quiet. Recommendation to hotel: 1) get wifi to work fulltime 2) include the fairly priced resort fee in the nightly room rate; we like to prepay our vacations beforehand, so the resort fee was a bit of surprise. 3) Fix the elevator's door sensor.

My return flight was overbooked, so I called Stay and they made a room for me for 3 days. Service: Front desk staff is mostly outstanding. Warm, friendly, accommodating and helpful--they are the personification of the Aloha Spirit. Daily housekeeping is quietly efficient and respectful. Location: Premium. In the shadow of The Hyatt, in the middle of Waikiki, 1 block to the beach, and walking distance to all things local. Rooms: Clean and small. My top/8th floor unit was a quiet room with single bunk beds. Linens and beds are fresh and comfortable. I believe all units have balconies. I would not want to stay a week in a room this small, especially if I was traveling with someone, but for others it might be ok. My only suggested improvements: Coffee maker and mini fridge in room. Amenities: Not much. But there is free morning coffee in the lobby, ice, parking on a first-come fee basis, and beach gear available. Free Wi-Fi was jankey and unreliable. Summary: Clean rooms and an outstanding staff, at a reasonable price, makes this hotel a good value and a recommended place to stay. As always; I travel to Waikiki several times a year, I can advise that Waikiki is a nice tropical urban adventure. The city comes with the negatives of a big city, along with the overwhelming benefits of a beautiful beachfront resort. Generally, everything in Waikiki is \u201ca little tired\u201d although there have been continuous improvements in the last few years. If you are traveling solo, take Roberts Hawaii from the airport (no rsvr rqd). Two or more people, take a taxi from the airport to the hotel (should be under $40). In Waikiki, nearly everything is walking distance or a short shuttle/bus away.

I was a little bit hesitant prior to booking as there were limited reviews about the hotel. Stay Waikiki is a small hotel with an awesome location (right behind the Hyatt, between the two towers on Koa Avenue). The beach and the main strip Kalakaua Ave are both 1 block away and there are ABC stores on both ends of the block (and around every corner of every block) for water, beer, snacks, snorkeling gear and Hawaii souvenirs. We had a standard queen bedroom, which included a lanai with a sliver of an oceanview. Room had AC, flatscreen TV, adequate closet space with drawers, and a very dated, small bathroom. The bathroom was probably my least favourite part of the hotel but not significant enough to ruin my stay. It was quite noisy especially early in the morning, as tour buses start loading and unloading right on Koa Avenue, in the back of the Hyatt. They also have service trucks on the other end of the hotel, which are just as loud. This is not the hotel's fault but just to keep in mind if you are a light sleeper. The hotel offers free complimentary breakfast daily, free wi-fi (connection was spotty at times) and has limited self-parking available at a first-come, first-serve basis for $15/day. We chose to park at the Waikiki Banyan (on Ohua and Kuhio) instead for $60/week with unlimited in-and-out privileges. They also have washer/dryer machines available for use at a cost. You can purchase single dose packets of laundry detergent and dryer sheets at the ABC store. Housekeeping staff were very hardworking and front desk staff could not be nicer. They were always happy to see you and offered very helpful insight about all things Oahu. Some constructive feedback for the hotel would be to better display the various extras that are available to the hotel guests, for example, washer/dryer usage, parking, fridge, iron, ice, DVD rental, printing services, etc. Almost all of our \"extra\" requests were met; we just had to ask for them as we didn't know if they were offered. It would be helpful for the guests to know that they have all of these extra services and amenities available - maybe via a pamphlet or sign. I would recommend this hotel on the condition that you don't expect more than what you are paying for; it is a clean, no frills hotel with all the basic necessities (and some extras).", "Date": "January 25, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "San Juan Capistrano, California", "Title": "\u201cPerfect for the on-the-go traveler\u201d", "Author": "RAnderson1507", "ReviewID": "UR123378634", "Content": "If you want plan on spending a lot of time in your room, this is the perfect hotel!

I would give 2.5 points but rounded down because I was given the runaround. We were hesitant to book anything besides our \"regular\", well known hotel where we always stay. The STAY WAIKIKI had good deals, was newly renovated, had only few but good reviews, so we gave it a shot. Here's what you need to know before you book, and if you decide to go with it, what to look for when you arrive. 1) The hotel is newly renovated and has a clean feel overall with modern styling elements and contrasty colors. The rooms have wood laminate floors. The baths are tiny. The fixtures are not updated, but are acceptable. In my room when sitting on the bowl, I could rest my chin on the sink. One could see that as a plus, or minus. Showers were completely tiled, which I prefer over silicone sealed plastic tubs. I was wary about the little brown crawling insects after some of the reviews, but did not see ANY in the 9 days I was there. 2) ONLY FLOORS 5 THROUGH 8 have balconies aka Lanais. So if you check in and expect a room with a balcony, make sure it's on floor 5 or higher and explicitely ask for a DELUXE (if that's what you booked). I'd also say from floor 6 and up you get a good view. The hotel is so narrow that it's only one room wide, meaning every entrance is on one side, every window or balcony is on the other (towards Diamond Head). 3) The tricky part is to catch a DELUXE room WITH a lanai. The supply here is limited. We booked a deluxe with lanai explicitly and they gave us a standard with lanai. After pointing this out, they moved us to a deluxe without lanai on floor 4, which we declined - terrible view and no lanai. We eat take-out on our lanai and rely on it. The \"booking system did also not allow for predicting when the next deluxe WITH lanai gets available\" - really, guys? Really? Well if you can't predict how long a room is taken, then I understand that the reservation system also does not allow for you to RESERVE me a deluxe with lanai, which is what I had booked in the first place. Ok, how stupid do you think I am. It's the age of computers. And luckily, also the age of tripadvisor reviews. 4) The DELUXE rooms are MUCH bigger than the standard. The standard is a shoe box. In the Deluxe you have room to breath. I saw both rooms, and believe me. You want the DELUXE SIZE, WITH lanai. 5) The parking garage is tiny and holds about 8-10 cars with only 2 spots allowing for full size cars or bigger. I'd say one or 2 spots can hold mini vans. I took the small spots with my Chevy Cobalt rental leaving the bigger ones for the minivans and had to maneuver multiple times to get in and out. NO KIDDING. Oh, btw, parking was \"full\" when we arrived and we were immediately advised that we have to park off site. $8 without in-and-out privileges. They used this as a bargaining chip later though (AHA!) and suddenly parking was available (and complimentary which was very nice, so thanks for this plus). 6) The staff is friendly, absolutely. But they are advised by their management to give you the runaround when it comes to giving you what you booked. I feel for them, but if you don't get your reservation system fixed it will be a returning problem. Again, we did book the DELUXE WITH LANAI and WE DID NOT GET IT. We're still on the phone daily with Expedia to get a refund. What a hassle. Had we known that, we would have gone with our \"old\" hotel where we know what we get into (which floor, which room, parking, staff etc). Again, friendly staff at the STAY, but the underlying theme was still visible which is giving you the runaround until you give up. If I have a week off, do I want to have a hassle with the front desk FOR TWO THIRDS of my vacation only so that I can get what I booked AND PAID FOR, only two days before I leave? No. And management knows that. Listen, management. Customers have a pretty good antenna for when they are given the runaround. No, I will not recommend this hotel to my friends, because of that. 7) Location is awesome. We saw whales from our lanai and you're right in the middle of things. I do prefer Hawaii in summer though. It's lush, greener, warmer, and smells better with the ginger and plumeria in bloom and the hala fruit falling. Less guava though in summer. It also seems like there are a little less tourists in summer. 8) IT IS LOUD even with closed windows and sliding doors. I had to use ear plugs every night, which was expected and is normal in the middle of the city. If you have been to Waikiki, you know that. If it will be your first time, be advised that you can't escape the sounds of the streets, nighlife, reversing buses, barking. Anywhere except in a high rise building on floors 15 and up (be advised, there you might have helicopter sounds).", "Date": "January 11, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Quebec City, Canada", "Title": "\u201cBest for the price\u201d", "Author": "Ivv_10", "ReviewID": "UR122836523", "Content": "Very nice hotel.

So on that note the hotel staff could not have been any more friendly then they were, we just loved them. The location is one block from waikiki beach!!! The room decor is done in Ikea which I love!! The hotel itself is definately older but they have updated the furniture and such so its really hip and fun. The bathroom fixtures are old but the room was very clean. They had a blow dryer, ironing board in the room as well as an Ipod dock. We had small deck but we could see the water from it even though it was only a sliver. The only downside to this place is the fact its behind the Hyatt and that happens to be the bus pick up for all the tours that go out in the area. Now depending where you are from the noise may be an issue for you. We are use to noise when we sleep plus we had the ac running in the early am so it really wasnt an issue. The windows are very old in the hotel they are the slat style and some of those wouldnt shut so you could hear the buses for sure. However that noise on the street did not make a difference to us. We would so stay there again. Waikiki was great loved seeing sunset everynight and being that close to shops, restaurants and the beach was just the best!!!
