This hotel is almost new, having been built in 2008, and still looks and feels new. It has a very similar layout to most of the other newer Homewood Suites where I've stayed previously. Pros: - Complete kitchen with full-size refrigerator, dishwasher, sink, 2-burner stove, and microwave. - Clean quiet rooms with flat-screen TV's with good selection of channels - Free wired Internet access - Free on-site parking - Complimentary daily breakfasts are also a plus, with rotating menu items including scrambled eggs, sausage, potatoes, waffles, cold and hot cereal, fruits, yogurt, and a variety of beverages. - Complimentary light dinners Monday through Thursday only, but alas no beer and wine like most other Homewood Suites where I've stayed. Cons: - As other reviewers have noted, the HVAC units are rather noisy, but since I had a 2-room suite with a separate HVAC unit in each room, I used the unit in the living area during the night to minimize the noise in the bedroom. - Depending on which way planes are taking off at the airport and if you have a room facing the airport, there is some additional noise from that, but not so much it interrupts your sleep. However, I rather enjoyed watching the planes take off and land, so it was not a concern for me.

Kudos to them. Rooms and hotel were very clean. Location was great, not close to the strip but if you have a car it is only about 1.5 miles or so to the strip. You can get onto 215 in less than 2 minutes and is 5 min to the Airport. The best part I liked -- We wanted to go to New Year's eve but the strip will be closed for vehicles and hotels won't let you park cars if you are not a guest on the strip hotel. What do we do, pay $30 for off strip parking places (that sprang up the same day) or stay in the room. I called the hotel and they said we will drop you and pick you up all night in a parking lot at the end of the strip. Voila, we enjoyed it and had someone drive us home (ok, hotel) after we partied on the strip until 2 AM. Couple of things I didn't like -- Wireless internet was very slow at 10kbps and when I explained this to the front desk he said 'wow, that is really slow' but didn't do anything about it. They installed some software to control tracking and have good experience for their computer users. Uniguest program was blocking every page we tried to look for shows available tonight. I explained this to him and he was like 'I will let them know' but didn't move an inch. I guess customer service wasn't his thing:) I would recommend this place anytime.

You can take a day off your car rental by using the Homewood Suite to delay your rental or bring the car back early. We flew in on a cheap flight, stayed at Homewood and then picked up the car the next day...then, when we returned the car, we stayed at Homewood and used their shuttle services and cabs. In all, we saved about $100 off our rental costs. Planning your trip and minimizing your rental car needs saves big bucks.

This allowed us to be in the heart of the strip to see all of the attractions and shows, but then get away from the insanity for our last couple of days since we planned 1 day to see Hoover Dam and 1 day to hike at Red Rock Canyon. The Homewood Suites was perfect for our needs. The 2 room suite was spacious and clean. The facility was secure. The close access to the highway made for easy trips to both Hoover Dam and Red Rocks. The hotel is surrounded by a business park with nothing special surrounding the hotel. But if you have a rental car, it's only a 5 minute drive to restaurants and the Las Vegas Outlet shopping area. The hotel has a free breakfast and dinner as well. Nothing exceptional, but decent if you want something quick. The workout facility was adequate and so was the pool. Again, nothing spectacular, but very functional. Parking was complimentary, ample and secure. The personnel were very friendly. Another perk is that we had an early morning flight the day of our departure. The rental car return facility is very close and this reduced stress by ensuring we had ample time to catch our flight. We did get some highway noise at night, but it was mostly drowned out by the AC system in the room. The noise was NOTHING like the strip. This is a great place for those that want a clean and relaxing place to stay away from the strip.

Free slow-speed internet in the business center and in room if you have a laptop. The only real gripe I have is that the shuttle schedule is not made clear. Yes the shuttle CAN run 24/7, going to the airport at the top of the hour and to Mandalay Bay at the half hour. But you have to call for it. The shuttle only runs automatically to the airport or to the strip if someone at the hotel requests it. So that means if you need to be picked up at the airport at 2:00pm or from Mandalay Bay at 2:30pm, you need to call them at 1:45pm or 2:15pm respectively, or get lucky. If you go by what hotel staff will tell you, naturally you assume the schedule is automatic. And so what happens is you are waiting for the 2:30pm shuttle at Mandalay Bay to come pick you up..they don't come..and so at 2:35pm you call them to ask if the shuttle is coming. Then they so no, you have to request it. Then you get to wait around for another hour for the next \"officially requested\" shuttle to show up.

Will be booking again whenever I go to Vegas again hands down!!!", "Date": "September 29, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Location": "2", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Omaha,Nebraska", "Title": "\u201cVery close to the airport.\u201d", "Author": "DeltaShuttle192", "ReviewID": "UR39465646", "Content": "This hotel from what I understand is roughly one year old, the hotel seems very new. The hotel and the area are fairly quiet for the exception of the airport noise. Its located at the exit of the terminal of the aiport so a I imagine wouldnt cost much to get there. I'd like to stress that this hotel is NOT walking distance to anything other than the rental car center which would be about a 5 to 10 minute walk. They do have shuttle service, however it only takes you to mandalay bay and picks up there.

This place had the most spotlessly clean and fresh smelling new rooms you could imagine...The bathroom was just like home...it was designed beautifully. The shower had a shower massage head that felt like a dream!... FULL FORCED WATER!....no little drips that you had to run under to catch and get aggravated with and when all was said and done it felt like you needed a shower!!!...It was a pleasure to fall sleep on a new beautiful clean king size bed!...just like home!...No smoke smell anywhere...Not a drop of noise in the place...any where...Full kitchen...Coffee (or tea) in the morning without having to get dressed and go out!...OMG! Fantastic...Secure building with a very friendly and helpfull staff!... Just one phone call to the front desk and you have the shuttle to take you to the strip!...there's so much more!...

It is just south of the Airport (no noise though) and near to a Whole Food Market. The main problem with the Strip hotels is that there is always traffic jams, no matter the time of day and hotel parking is a fair distance from your room, usually meaning a trip via the casino to get to the guest elevators. At Homewood Suites, no traffic jams and parking is simple, right outside the door. The one bedroom suite has a kitchenette and living area. The breakfast is the usual fair, during the week they do provide evening meals, but we did not sample them. All in all, if you have transport, this hotel provides all that you need at a very reasonable cost.", "Date": "July 18, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "3", "Location": "3", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Arizona", "Title": "\u201cNice Place, but unhappy with service\u201d", "Author": "Katsy", "ReviewID": "UR32323725", "Content": "Our family of 6 stayed for one night at the end of a trip outside the US. The property is very nice but we were not happy with the service. Half-way through the designated breakfast time, much of the food ran out....excuse was that they didn't expect to be so busy. That excuse is not acceptable. Next issue is that before going to breakfast we took our bags to the car, leaving only a couple of items in the room, including some medication that is taken after eating. The maid was not on the floor when we left the room. While we were out the room was cleaned...even though we had not checked out. The maid put the few items that we left on the bathroom vanity into a bag and had it on her cart, however the medication was gone. It had been thrown away. This action was also not acceptable. This is a nice place but does not appear to have good management.
