I have not written many reviews on places that I have been to, however, I felt I needed to write about this one as it was one of the most amazing places I have stayed at. Villa Asante has only recently opened so we only found out about it through word of mouth and what a find !. The villa is situated at Echo Beach in Canggu, it is stones throw from the the beach itself which has some of the best surf in Bali and it is about a 30 min drive to the airportWe went with a large group which had 6 adults and seven children, we were a bit concerned as we were not sure if they could comfortably accommodate us, we needn't of worried ! We arrived at the villa to be met with frangipani lays and a cold towel (love those touches), the villa itself is very large and has a wonderful feeling of space which is something I have not felt at other places I stayed at in Bali. The villa has three separate buildings, one double story which houses four double bedrooms, four bathrooms and a large kids TV room. The other two buildings are dining / kitchen and the other lounge room. The grounds are large and houses an enormous pool which we felt was very important considering how many children we had. As it turned out the children spent their lives in it often swimming right up until bedtime. The staff were incredibly attentive and were never over bearing. The food was brilliant, we ordered dinner most nights as the kids wanted to hang out swimming and the food was so good. We ordered off a menu which included loads of bbq'ed foods such as king prawns, sate etc The staff organised people to come and give us massages, pedicures, manicures and facials, other stuff that they organised were white water rafting and a wonderful cycle trip that was 25 kms downhill ! We had a very tasty meal at the bottom which was very welcome.Everyone was totally catered for, the villa itself is gorgeous and totally pristine. All in all I have to say that it was one of the easiest and best family holidays I have ever been on and we will definately be returning to this Villa", "Date": "Oct 28, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR520866875", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "Dee97"}], "HotelInfo": {"HotelURL": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g311298-d1195698-r21418193-Villa_Asante_Bali-Canggu_Bali.html", "HotelID": "1195698", "Price": "Unkonwn"}}
