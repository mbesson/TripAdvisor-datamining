Customer service agent suggested a comparable hotel nearby. (This is a one and a half star at best) I asked for the location so we could go look at it but was told rooms were filling up and i should go ahead and reserve. We arrived there 15 min later. Area felt extremely unsafe, drunk people staggering between the convenience store next door and the hotel. There was a chain link fence to the rooms. I went into the shabby lobby to speak with the desk clerk Brett. He was rude and unhelpful. He said there was a 100% cancellation fee because I hadn't cancelled before 4pm the previous day. I explained that we'd only booked the reservation 15 min earlier but he still refused any refund.

Instead, they offered me a double bed room for the same price I paid for the whirlpool suite. I had to call hotel.com before 4 o'clock to cancel my reservation and had to book a new hotel room, which was seriously inconvenient!

We've never had a problem, though the facilities are average at best. I made reservations for New Years Eve back in November. The site was booked for 3 nights through a reservation site. I requested 30 amp service and a pull through site. When i received the confirmation I saw they had me set for 50 amp service, which I am unable to use, and charged me an extra $15.00 for this service. I emailed them right away to correct this and requested they credit my card back for the $15.00 charge but never heard from them. I decided I would address this when I arrived in New Orleans. When I got there I spoke to the man at the registration desk and he told me they \"are working on getting this corrected\". The site didn't matter since the entire campground was practically empty. I still hadn't heard anything about the over charge by the time I left so I decided to drop it. However, when I checked my account I found there was an additional charge for $105.00. This angered me a bit and I decided since I had to call them again about that charge that I also wanted the other $15.00 as well. When I spoke to them they told me they had already cancelled the charge for $105.00 but that no one there could refund the $15.00 and I would have to call the reservation company for the refund. I called them and they seemed confused as to why I was referred to them but they called for me to try to straighten it out. I received a call back from them and was told that Mardi Gras Campground/Red Carpet Inn refused to refund the money. Now I'm pissed so I called back to the campground and told them I wanted to no what their justification was for keeping my money? This was their answer verbatim.....\"There IS NO JUSTIFICATION. We just don't do refunds!\". The person I spoke with told me he would \"talk to the boss\" about it and call me back but so far I've had no return phone calls. It's not about the $15.00 anymore but the principle. They admit they owe me the money but just refuse to give it back.

Traveling as a solo male or a group of adults this isn't a bad place to use as a base camp. It is about 7 minutes east of the FQ by car off the highway.

Well as you can imagine, New Orleans has been really affected by Katrina..So I wasn't waiting for a super hotel. Moreover I booked late and prices in hotel were high because of Mardi Gras.So with 3 other folks we booked two nights at the red carpet. First the neighbourhood is really hugly.From my hotel room you could see a big rusty plant.On the other side, you could see the motorway bridge going downtown. Then the red carpet is a motel on a camping ground.So the parking was full of Winnebago camping cars,lol Anyway, the motel itself was nearly new! The room was big enough for 4 people and clean! And it is about 5/10 minutes to the French quarter So I recommend for young students with a car who need a place to sleep and don't want to pay much.
