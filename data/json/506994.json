We have visited Beit al Bahar previously and enjoyed our stay. Five years later although the accommodation is still beautiful many things have changed. The service is much poorer and much reduced however this is not our main concern. The whole point of Beit al Bahar is that is is an exclusive oasis of tranquility, excellent service and luxury. Its close proximity to Wild Wadi water park means that the noise from pop music beating out from 10am until closing time means that it is far from a tranquil should you wish to spend time around the Beit al Bahar pool or your own plunge pool. When we mentioned it to the manager that it was incredible noisy around our villa (no 7 I believe), he acted surprised and said that no-one had ever mentioned that before but he would ask Wild Wadi to turn down the music. It did not happen. It dawned on us that on the last time we visited our children were younger and therefore needed accompanying to the beach, wild wadi etc. therefore we weren't spending much time during the day at Beit al Bahar. Five years later we were hoping that we would enjoy a peaceful timeby the villa and our son would be free to go to and from wild wadi without us. We had thought Beit al Bahar would be the best of both worlds; our son would do the things he would want to do and we could be nearby but in peace. How wrong we were! Wild Wadi invades the villas. It is not a quiet place. It is not an oasis of tranquility. So, nothing happened to reduce the noise during the day but in the evening Beit al Bahar is a lovely place to be - unless the management allow fellow guests to hold a party there with guest from neighbouring hotels. There are many signs around explaining that Beit al Bahar is an exclusive place for use of its guests only. Also the signs around say that the pool is closed from 8pm. We didn't use it after that so why was a rowdy group of people, including screeching children, allowed to party and bomb into the swimming pool until after midnight? When I phoned after midnight to complain we were told that the group had been asked to leave but the noise continued for a while. The following day the manager bumped into my husband and apologised for the noise. He said the group of guests from the sister hotel had been asked to leave the premises and I would I like a spa treatment? An absolutely half hearted apology we felt. In other respects Beit al Bahar is fine but its service is definitely no-where near where it was 5 years ago. Staff seem less concerned, less happy, more half hearted. Clearly some of them were lovely and helpful but certainly no more than should be expected as minimum for a place of this price and supposed quality. In the six months since we visited Beit al Bahar we have visited Four Seasons in the Maldives and Singita in South Africa. Both of these places really do know what service is about. Jumeirah (the group that Beit al Bahar is within) is not top quality any more. It feels more like a machine and much less concerned with personal touches. More than anything though it is the attitude and response of the management that makes us feel that Jumeirah will not be our resort provider of choice. It is an expensive place to visit, which would be fine if it lived up to its own publicity. It doesn't. Jumeirah needs to re-evaluate its service levels.", "Date": "March 10, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "London, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cThe Jewell in the Jumeirah Dubai Crown\u201d", "Author": "Knellswith2and2", "ReviewID": "UR116298130", "Content": "Beit Al Bahar is the place to stay in Dubai. A perfect balance of service and luxury facilities. The combination of the highest standard of service, luxurious villas and surrounding facilities, made our holiday magical and full of wonderful memories that will last a lifetime. We had an absolutely brilliant holiday. The children cried that they had to leave! And in the eight weeks since we have returned they keep asking when can we go back? Emotions and questions we adults hide but feel just as strongly. As a party of six; grandparents, parents and two children under eight, we have been fortunate to stay at the Jumeirah Beach Hotel, in premium leisure rooms and Junior Suites, and the Burj Al Arab in two separate suites. This time we thought we would try the Beit al Bahar. Whilst we had wonderful holidays on the previous occasions and without any discredit to their superb facilities or service levels, in our opinion, the Beit Al Bahar is a hidden treasure. There are many wonderful things to note, however, there is one element that must be mentioned. The outstanding staff. We spoke with all the staff we met and all of them were positive, genuine, polite & communicative. Due to their roles we had the chance to speak with some more than others and met others we first met 5 years ago. Russell Dray, the manager and Shetty the butler were two names that I can recall now. They and all the other staff driving the buggies, in the restaurants, at the Wild Wadi and at the pools without exception are to be highly praised. This holiday was to celebrate a 40th birthday and the staff did everything possible to make every element of our celebrations special and memorable. Exceptional service, tables and food in restaurants, balloons and cards in the villa, and more birthday cakes than we should eat! The villas are located in a secluded area between JBH & BAA providing privacy and tranquillity. The bedrooms and bathrooms are superb. The sunken bath is pure indulgence, the beds sumptuous and the calmness of the whole ambiance contrasting with the heat and sun is sublime. It\u2019s better than home from home! We were fortunate to be in a 2 bed villa, on the front row with a clear view of the Burj. The perfect location, with a large patio, round hardwood table and chairs, four loungers and a plunge pool. The large patio was perfect for all times of day. The children loved the plunge pool, (parents are the life guards at this one), and to sit of an evening talking and watching the lights on the Burj was great. If you are considering the JBH, spend the bit extra and you will be glad you did. If you are considering BAA, this is far more relaxing and private. It may not have the gold and crystal sparkles but it is the Jewell in the Jumeirah Dubai Crown.", "Date": "August 5, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "London", "Title": "\u201cAmazing Amazing Amazing\u201d", "Author": "PKANDLQ", "ReviewID": "UR115574516", "Content": "Well it does not get much better than this.

We stayed in Villa No.6 and it was absolutely amazing! The facilities in the villas are all first class...from the Bose surround system in the lounge/bathroom to the amazing drinks cupboard with a top-notch espresso machine...not to mention the Playstation 3 in the bedroom! The attention to details is great and it feels like a home away from home. The service is like nothing I've ever experienced and everyone is happy to help you...I know it's easy saying that when you're paying a lot of money but everyone is so genuine that you don't feel awkward or uncomfortable. The plunge pool is a great way to cool off and the happy hour with free drinks and snacks is a nice way to start the evening. I chose this place because I was planning to propose to my girlfriend. The staff helped arrange a private romantic meal on the beach and pulled out all the stops. Nazeer and Lashitha helped me with all my requests and were excellent at helping me prepare for the special occasion. I could write pages and pages of praise about this place and the staff but I'm not going to bore you. If you're considering to stay here I'd definitely recommend it . If you're planning a special surprise and wondering if it's worth the money then I'd still say go for it!!

Make sure you book the villas overlooking the beach, the views are amazing. The service in this hotel is seriously good, and Shetty and his team of butlers will take care of your every need. This is an oasis in Dubai which is a very busy place, you can truly relax and enjoy some peace here secluded and protected. The private pool is very quiet within the villa area or if you choose to use the pool by the beach with your own cabana which has your name above that is a wonderful touch. The children's pools are excellent and always well covered by life guards. The staff are graceful and are careful not to intrude on your quiet time. We enjoyed our balconies with the plunge pool when we were feeling too lazy to leave. The perfect place to get over jet lag and a very good option for a holiday in its own right. Especially for those with babies and toddlers as almost is done for you and you can relax. Dubai has alot to offer families, we loved the whole experience, the new Emirates terminal, the hotel transfer on time, slick and very very comfortable. The hotel welcome and arrival. Dubai really has reached a new standard, and although the villas could do with a bit of updating now, as they have been exactly the same since we started using them five years ago we will always go back - you simply can not rival it in Dubai.", "Date": "August 29, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "hampshire, england", "Title": "\u201cJust perfect\u201d", "Author": "caldjac", "ReviewID": "UR26782301", "Content": "We were fortunate to have been upgraded to the villas from a 2 bedroom suite at the hotel and it was just wonderful.

The accomodation, service, and faclities were excellent. We did however get upgraded from a 1bed villa to a 2bed villa due to construction in front of our patio. The difference was huge. The 2 bedroom villa has a far larger patio with 4 deckchairs and over looked the beach and the burj. The 1 bed villa was located on the first row with a view onto the nearby villas- pretty disappointing. So make sure if you stay here you request a villa in the 3rd row- those with views over the beach and the burj al arab. I have stayed at the mina and jumeirah beach hotel and these villas are the best we have stayed in. They have an arabic feel and with an extensive patio with loungers and a plunge pool- you couldnt get better accomodation. Each villa has a huge living room - L-shaped sofa and a separate table with 4chairs. You also get a latop with free internet access. The bathroom is amazing with the largest and deepest bath I have ever seen- takes around 30mins to fill up! You also have access to the private beach for execuvite/premium/madinat/burj guests. Also, there is a pool just for villa guests with a small outdoor bar/restaurant in the middle of the villa area. There is also a villa restaurant just for villa guests which we only went to for breakfast. The best thing is that you dont need to walk through a large hotel to get to the beach/pool- u just leave ur villa and u are there.

Not having to worry about the little things, made a big difference to our trip. There are so many examples of the Beit Al Bahar and the Jumeriah Beach Hotel staff ensuring we didn\u2019t have to worry or think about anything. The only time we really had to think, was when we tried to decide where to eat at the many fantastic Jumeriah International restaurants! The Beit Al Bahar staff was always so kind and helpful and they truly anticipated our needs, sometimes before we even knew what our needs were! One afternoon after a day on the beach, we were in our villa debating going to get a light snack as we didn\u2019t have dinner reservations until 10pm. Literally, during this discussion, our doorbell rang and the villa staff brought us afternoon tea. This was completely unexpected and was appreciated for many reasons \u2013 anticipating our needs, a light snack and most importantly \u2013 a traditional experience.
