The day before we arrived, I read some of the noise complaints on Tripadvisor and emailed the hotel requesting a quiet room. On check-in, we were assigned room 1808. The bedroom is compact and had a queen bed, not the promised king. The living room is spacious, with a generous living area with kitchen sink and microwave. The 'quirk' comes here; although there are masses of kitchen drawers and a lot of bench space, there isn't one stick of crockery (bar tea-cups), or cutlery, not a single pot or a pan. So odd! Why put in a large kitchen area and microwave and not at least provide plates, bowls and basic crockery???! This was annoying as I wanted breakfast in the room and was planning cereal, but couldn't as my only option would have been to eat it out of the small coffee / tea cups, the only crockery provided.

Located in Central Kowloon near Nathan Road and Kowloon Park. Pros - Room was large. I was upgraded to a Suite as a courtesy. For a family or a group this would be nice. There is a Kitchenette with a microwave, refrigerator, sink, counter top for food prep, and a small dining area. This room also had a large outdoor patio with a table and chairs although I could not open the door to go out and take a look. - Free WiFi - Staff spoke English and was both courteous and helpful - 2 blocks from the East Tsim Sha Tsui train station on Mody Road. - Very comfortable bed! I'm picky about that. Cons - A little off the beaten path. It would be a bit of a walk or short taxi ride to the area attractions like the Temple Street Market. You can walk to nearby shopping and dining. - Street is a little noisy at night but not overbearing - The bathroom was nice but the tile could use a good scrubbing and maintenance. The room could have used a fresh coat of paint as well. - TV was a little small if you plan to spend time watching it Overall I would say this is a 3 plus hotel. If it was a little closer to some of the attractions I would say it was a good value. It was fine for me but for someone that is on vacation it might not fit the bill. My room at least could use a little freshening up. The shower head had a leak that shot straight into the ceiling and as stated the tile could use some cleaning. The carpet, although not terrible, is probably due for replacement. I travel to Hong Kong on business every 2 months or so and like to try different places. I didn't have any major issues but probably would not stay here again.

Butterfly on Prat is a block away, and close enough to the Tsim Sha Tsui MTR station for easy sightseeing or getting to Central.

Location: walking distance (about 10 mins stroll) to TST MTR. Prat Ave is not a very well-known street for the taxi drivers, so have the address in Chinese with you, it will come in handy. Surrounded by eateries and convenience stores, so it's always convenient for a late night snack or dessert. There are several pubs along and around Prat Ave, so it's quite lively at night. Rooms: Small but considerably comfortable for Hong Kong standards. We had one large and one small luggage and one of them had to be placed on the floor. So we had to jump over it when we walked past that corner. There is a mini fridge, microwave, electric kettle and safe in the room. Water heater in the shower works perfectly, didn't have to wait long. Free cable and wifi connection in the room is fast. I didn't like the bed frame as it has sharp corners. The hotel had covered the corners but it still hurts when I knocked my shin on them. As the hotel is located in a small lane, forget about having a view as the room on the highest floor (18th) looks straight into another building opposite. The biggest problem I had with the room is noise. The doors are not sound proof so I could hear noises coming from the corridor. It didn't help that I had some guests from China staying next door who talks loudly and woke me up every morning. The housekeeper goes around at 10am in the morning knocking on every door shouting \"housekeeping!\" which adds up the frustration.

We stayed there for 5D4N. What I can say is the hotel is very clean and space is average. But this is very usual in HK anyways. The place is so good as there are many good restaurants just outside the hotel and the food is nice too! Usually, we go to the one just in front of the hotel and the price is nice and the servings are too big! There are also lots of shopping centers around as this is in Tsim Sha Tsui. MRT station is around 5mins walk only. Also, we visit Macau for a day and the ferry terminal is just a walking distance away from the hotel. For the staffs, they are very nice and welcoming. Everytime we come in, the reception greets and smiles at us. Service is good and housekeeping cleans good as well. For special requests, I really like pillows so when checking-in, I don't know that they had 4 pillows already and I requested for 2 more during check-in. This is because I thought they will be giving 2 pillows only like the one we visited in HK in 2011. So they give me additional 2 pillows and we had 6! This is with no extra charge. The sleep is comfortable and the sheets, pillows and towels are clean. They provide toiletries, toothbrush and even disposable slippers! After 2 days of stay, they replenish the supplies of toiletries and slippers. Like many hotels, towels can be replaced everyday as long as you put it on the floors. There is also a safe where you can put your important things and a wardrobe. For the security, you can only ride the elevator to your floor when you have the card, which is also used to open your room. The only downside for me is the aircon is either too cold or too warm.

We wanted something nice, yet not too pricey, located close to metro and Tsim Sha Tsui. As a Chinese, my preferred part to stay in is in Kowloon, as I think that the Island is just too full of expats and doesn't seem as local as it does on the mainland part of HK. We loved the hotel, we had room 1708 which was perfect, just the smallest room they have, but it was still big enough for the two of us for our 8 night stay. The room was clean, good amenities, nice with a fridge and microwave to keep all of our drinks and left over foods from various restaurants, free wifi worked perfect, air con was great, the staff was nice, even though we keep to ourselves and stay discreet and do not interact too much with them. Our room was facing the backside of the hotel, so there was no noise to be heard, and our view was just buildings opposite our hotel. We heard clients at reception asking for rooms with views, but they clearly do not know HK and the area of Tsim Sha Shui by Nathan and Chatham if they want room with a view, not much to see in that area from high above. The hotels that will have views are located right by the water and are in a much higher price range than Butterfly. Again, we used the room to sleep in and that was it. The hotel is perfectly located at Tsim Sha Tsui, 3 min walk to the metro, exit A2 on Humphreys, lots of shops, eateries, grocery stores, bars, massage parlors on the short walk between metro and hotel. We even managed to eat at one of them next to the hotel at 2.30am in the morning! Many buses as well on Chatham and Nathan Road, so easy to get around, easy to walk over to the Star Pier to catch the cheap Star Ferry over to the Island, and short walk to Avenue of the Stars as well.

They also offer a bus shuttle service to the aiport which I took advantage of. Hourly service at around 140HK$. Might not be as cheap as a regular bus, but was convenient.

The hotel is modern and bright and although the rooms are small, they are very comfortable with flat screen TVs and a good selection of English channels, a fridge, microwave, safe, free Wi-Fi, and a hair dryer.

Also, there was no electrical outlet in the bathroom so I had to blow dry my hair outside of the bathroom, and the cord didn't reach over to where the mirror was. One more negative, and this is a big one for us, there was a reading light on one side of the bed but not on the other.

My partner had fit as well if he'd joined. + bathroom also clean, good shower + free wifi of good quality + microwave in every room - didn't use it, but loved this option! There are 2 convenience stores in the street too, so fancy hot noodles anytime in the room? No problem! + reception staff was always friendly - the hotel does not serve breakfast. To me not a problem, the street of the hotel alone had several options and TST is full of eateries everywhere. But to those who want to slip downstairs for a quick brekkie before dressing for the day, not going to happen here! - I asked for a wake up call on marathon morning...and didn't get called until 30 mins AFTER I requested it. Luckily I had 3 other alarm clocks for this particular occasion, but was still not amused. The gentleman did not really sound like he cared too much... - the room was pretty quiet though it must be said that the walls aren't the thickest of all hotels I've ever stayed in HK.

Also conveniently located for the MTR (subway) trains, only a couple of minutes away on foot, so you can get here from the airport by train very easily, without taking a taxi or the airport bus (that takes a long time as it stops off at all the hotels, the MTR is quick and very impressive). In addition the Butterfly on Prat is within easy walking distance of the Hong Kong Polytechnic University and the Museum of History (recommended) and in a safe area where I never felt in danger. So why did I only give this hotel a rating of three out of five? I initially booked a Superior Room but on arrival when I was shown to the room I found it totally claustrophic, as it was very small and overlooked an inner courtyard with no view of the street (or harbour) and this meant you needed to keep the blinds down all the time: not very good for reading. I asked for an upgrade as I was very disappointed with the Superior room, and they moved me to a De Luxe room but this was certainly no more than what I would consider to be a standard hotel room and it was considerably more expensive than the rate quoted for the \"Superior Room\". The room was clean and well furnished and I had a view down onto the street 17 floors below, but nothing spectacular. In addition there are no public rooms AT ALL in the hotel, so if you want to sit in the lounge and drink a coffee and read the newspaper, sorry, you can't do that. On the ground floor the lobby is a narrow passageway with two receptionists, then two computers with Internet access - but no seats, you have to stand while reading your mail - and then the lift. So no public rooms at all. Not even a breakfast room - and the places where you can get breakfast on Prat Avenue are not all that inspiring. In comparison, some colleagues were staying at the Metropole, just two minutes away, and when I went to their hotel one evening I was impressed by the vast public areas where you could sit and talk. They paid much less than I did at the Butterfly, and they had a much more spacious hotel. At the Butterfly you basically just get a room, and not a big one even if you opt for a De Luxe room, and then you pay a good deal more than for the Superior room. And breakfast is not available. The fitness room was really tiny and I couldn't bring myself to use it. Next time I think I will check the rates at the Metropole.

I needn't have worried about the lack of wifi internet as there was an internet cable provided - in a little grey bag byt he bedside drawers which is easy to miss, The room was small but I liked it. I was on my own though and maybe 2 people would feel cramped. But you don't go to Hong Kong for the space. Breakfast across the road at the French cafe is great and relatively cheap - $32 HKD was all I spent each day. Do not go to the Italian restaurant downstairs as they ripped me off. I chose what I wanted to eat based on the 2 menus they had on the wall outside. The bill was higher. This is because the menu has a revised price. I said I didn't need to look at the menu as it is outside. They argued and were really rude to me. I was quite shocked at how rude. I think this attitude was wholly inappriopriate and wrong. Transport to places couldn't have been easier. I walked to get the Star Ferry - 10 mins away. There is also a Marks and Spencer nearby so it was good to do some shopping! It was lovely to go for a walk along the promenade of the stars in the evening. The staff were wonderful and very helpful. I'm not putting a high score on value as I travelled over New year and all hotels in hong Kong are out to rip you off - $500 for one night for New Year's eve. Can you believe it? Normally it is $120.

If you come from Granville Road then you have to turn right into Carnavon Road, pass Cameron Road on the left and Prat Avenue is the next road. The hotel is located on the right hand side of the road on Prat Avenue. Look out for \" Neway \" signage at the top and you will be able to spot the hotel.

Free Wi-Fi is of course great and gives much comfort to those who need internet access to check their mails etc. No faults about the deluxe room as well. Only feedback we can give is that the pillows given in the room were way too soft. Even with 2 pillows you can't really feel the support.

So, do note that, if you're traveling with someone you're actually not very close to (e.g. colleagues on a business trip), or if you have inquisitive, running children? The staff are sweet- they helped to print the flight itineraries for free. I've yet to been to a budget hotel which provides macs at the lobby, free wifi, on top of free printing. Friendly room service crew too. Location wise, it is not the best, but it doesn't matter. Whatever you might need is within walking distance.

However there are also a lot of choices for budget/valued conscious minded travels and this is one of my favorite! I travel to HK a lot and because of a friend working in the Starwood group I always stay at the W in Kowloon station. So I consider myself pretty spoiled about hotels in HK. When I no longer can get the family and friends rate at the W, I've been experimenting with boutique hotels in the Tsim Sha Tsui area. The rule of thumb I had is, hotels get cheaper and better with each city block you are willing to walk away from a MTR station or the Harbor City mall. This hotel fits the description very well. If you are someone who only need a decent place to rest at night while you roam the city by day this one of the place for you! As my title suggests, you pay for the things you need and nothing you don't! The hotel is clean, roomy for HK, has free internet, and just 3 blocks from the closest MTR entrance. It doesn't have a giant lobby or a hotel front which you don't need anyway. Note there is no swimming pool which is something you may like to have for a vacation. The only down side is there are a few pub downstairs which can get a bit louder even for HK. In the area I've tried, the Marco Polo Prince, The Mira, and the Bauhinia Hotel. The Prince is your standard 4 star hotel roomy and great location in the middle of the shopping mall, but it doesn't have free internet and cost twice ($200-$300) as Butterfly. The Mira is trendy and most W like, but when you take a step back, its an older 3 star hotel layout with a giant face lift decorated into a 5 star boutique and cost like a 5 star.

There are 18 floors in the hotel and we stayed in room 1709 not facing the street and luckily we experienced no noise from the streets/karaoke bars as mentioned by a few other reviewers. The walls are definitely thin where we heard the hallway noise clearly (doors shutting, people talking etc). Rooms are tiny but the bed and stand up shower makes up for it. The bed is super comfy and the rain shower head is really relaxing after a long day walking in the humid/hot weather. The carpets are due for a steam cleaning as spots were visible throughout. A major negative point to the room was the glass window that views into the bathroom. It was awkward and unnecessary. Luckily I was travelling with my significant other but I don't see myself staying at this hotel with anyone else solely based on that see-through window. Housekeeping was good however during my 9 day stay they came to my room on several occasions asking me if I ordered lunch or if I ordered laundry service, which I didn't and I'm assuming they got mixed up with another room. It was annoying to be woken up for these mistakes so the DO NOT DISTURB sign went up for the remainder of my stay. The MTR is a 10 minute walk away and was our preferred mode of transportation, super easy to use and got us to all of the popular destinations efficiently. It is a boutique hotel (small and unknown hotel to most taxi drivers) with a teeny tiny lobby but it had all the necessities of a large hotel and its location can't be beat for the rate we paid, the overall quality of this hotel was fantastic.

Pros: Wifi internet worked in the room, Large bathroom (walk in shower) with good toiletries, staff were very attentive and helpful. Good location in central Tsim Sha Tsui (TST). Cons: No catering on site (but plenty of breakfast options nearby, including Delifrance on the corner), TST is a busy night time spot so expect some noise at night. Butterfly on Prat is one of three 'Butterfly' hotels in Hong Kong - I suspect they are all very similar, so if you are not sure on Tsim Sha Tsui as a location, definitely consider one of the other hotels (in Central).", "Date": "July 27, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Isle of Man", "Title": "\u201cGreat Hotel\u201d", "Author": "OrientalKyoko", "ReviewID": "UR115739777", "Content": "I stayed at the Butterfly on Prat for 6 nights and upgraded to a delux room on the 17th floor because I was told that the room was better and I would be less likely to be affected by street noise.

Good: The location was in the middle of everything, though it's about a 7minute walk to the subway entrance. The room was clean and spacious (could open up a full sized luggage on the floor). Toiletries such as toothbrush, shower cap, soap shampoo and conditioner were provided. The room also had a microwave oven, hair dryer, LAN point and cable. Other than a tv and DVD player, they had a small iPod/iPhone dock with speakers, which was great as we didn't have to unpack any cables to charge our phones. Bad: We arrived at 10am was told our non-smoking rooms were not ready. We left our stuff in our friend's smoking room, and went out to return at 3. 1hr after the stated check-in time, our rooms still weren't ready. Since it was a short visit for us, the delay and return trip to the hotel just to find out we still can't check in, messed up our packed schedule for the day. By the time everyone else checked it, it was about 4pm. To make up for the service loss, they upgraded us from the superior to the delux room. Another gripe was the noise. After a whole day out, we couldn't sleep in past 9am. House keeping woke everyone in the group up between 8 and 9am. If you forgot to put the \"do not disturb sign\" on the door, good luck because they would be pounding on your door for a good 10minutes - multiple times. And if you did put the sign on your door, it's useless because not only can you hear house keeping pounding on everyone's door (I don't get it, it's not as if they tried opening the door after knocking for so long!), you will also hear the crew chatting with each other whilst cleaning across rooms, and thumping their cleaning gear against the walls. It's a pity that though the room was comfortable, we couldn't get any rest while in it as the insulation was very poor. Also, no wifi in the room. You see everyone huddled in the lobby tapping on to the wifi on their iPads and iphones. There LAN access points are already there, wiring wise it shldnt be too difficult to hook up wifi access on the floors! we really gotta thank our neighbor who set up a wifi hotspot in the room nxt to us on his laptop, and 'hokwong' jewelers that didn't encrypt their wifi ;) we also did our research on places to visit by visiting the m1bar nxt door, asking for the password, and surfed whilst sipping a beer.

Check in was efficient and fast and they do have bell boys to assist with the luggages despite being a boutique hotel. The only negative aspect I can find of this hotel is the KEY!!! Guess it has been a long while since I used a key to open a hotel room and the funny thing is that they do provide a card to activate the power supply in the room but no card key system, guess they should invest in one as it is trouble some to return the key to the reception everytime you go out and also you start to worry of dropping it when you are out with it!! Room wise as expected in all rooms in Hong Kong is small but comfortable, definitely not the smallest I have seen but I like it very much as it is clean and modern.

The fresh fragrance that deodorises the small & very trendy lobby (Elizabeth Arden's Green Tea??) is refreshing and slightly intoxicating. The lobby desk is always manned by staff and a doorman who's so reliable we must've only opened the hotel's front door a handful of times in six days. For our first 3 nights we stayed in a superior room which is adequate but small. There's an LCD TV with a small selection of English channels, a clock radio with Ipod integration, a DVD player, safe, microwave, fridge and kettle. The ironing board needs to be requested from the front desk. Shower is large and spacius, no bath though. We found the small glass window to the bathroom to be very unusual (it allows a view of the shower and toilet from the wardrobe end of the room). Make sure you ask for extra pillows as we found their pillows were so soft they provided no head or neck support whatsoever. The hotel was kind enough to upgrade us to a deluxe on our second round of 3 nights after we spent one night in Macau, the layout of room is the same as the superior but there's a good half-metre extra walking space around the bed and wardrobe corridor which made the room feel less cramped and let us pack\\unpack our suitcases much easier. In-room Internet is provided free of charge via the LAN cable sadly there's no free WIFI. There are two Macs in the lobby providing free internet just beware they run Safari not IE or Firefox and you have to use them standing up.

The hotel is perfectly situated between the TST and East TST MTR stations with entraces to the sprawing underground subway to either station only a block away.

The hotel is about 5 minutes walk from TST station, so it's convenient without being too busy, especially at night. We arrived at about 10pm, and despite booking way in advance, we were given a disabled- friendly room in a corner of the 8th floor. While I'm all for disabled access, this meant that our room had a shower that would go no more than shoulder height, and a tiny sink the size of a salad bowl at thigh height, with no vanity or anywhere else to put stuff. I don't know if this was the last room or if all rooms are like that (I hope not), but the staff should have at least checked with us before giving us the room, or informed us of this at the time of booking. This made an otherwise pleasant stay a little bit uncomfortable. Beds are also small, so if you are travelling with a child, make arrangements. 2 plus 1 just don't fit.

My request for a room on a high floor was honored. Checking-in was fast and the front desk staff was uniformly efficient, polite, and always smiling on all shifts throughout the whole stay. The room was modern, clean, and a good size although it could do with a more comfortable chair at the work desk besides the hard wood one that is there.

There is a Circle K and & Eleven down the street to stock up on milk, yogurt, etc. to have for breakfast or in the middle of the night. There is an in-room safe but not laptop-size. The bed was comfortable. Bathroom a good size. I didn't like the design of the bowl-like sink that is hard to wash your hands without getting the surroundings all wet.

I was able to walk most places and there are several entrances to the MTR station. Plenty of restaurants and shopping options within a few minutes walk. If you arrive by the airport express to Kowloon station there is a free shuttle # K4 but it drops you off at the Park Hotel one street over. The walk is only a few minutes but depends on the amount of luggage you have. I didn't mind on the way in, but since I had extra luggage on departure I opted to take a taxi to Kowloon station which was only 37 HK dollars.

After 15 minutes or so, with the thermostat turned to 30\u00b0 Centigrade, we called to see what was wrong with the heating system. The desk clerk informed us that there was no heating system; the hotel only has an air conditioning system. After the initial offer of a couple of blankets was rejected, we were offered an electric space heater that could be plugged into the wall outlet. This solved the problem--but management should, in cold weather, point out that there is no heating system and offer the space heater upon checking in. If you arrive in warmer weather, you can expect a conveniently located hotel with an exercise facility, in room microwave and mini fridge at a very reasonable price and a very friendly staff. Rooms have direct Internet access with the cable provided, plus a hair dryer and all the normal toiletries and then some. We recommend you try an upper floor to escape the noise that emanates from the nearby bars, and be sure and get a receipt from your cab if you choose that route from the airport.

First of all, we checked out early from Anne Black (see my other review for the complete story) and moved in here earlier than booked (on booking.com) and they were helpful though the direct rate was 10% higher. For the first night, we stayed in a double room - it wasn't very convenient cause I was travelling with my young son. For double rooms, the bathroom is completely transparent. With other hotels like Novotel which use the same concept, there's always this option for one to so called \"lower the blinds\" but this one can't!! The next day, they asked us to pack early and moved all our luggage to a twin room while we were out. It was nicely done, and like I said, the staff were great! In both rooms though, there was this strong stench from the toilet bowl and the draining holes in the shower. At first, I thought it was from my son's smelly socks but we confirmed later that it was from those places. On the last night, we shared this with the front desk and they sent in someone to do the spraying but the smell returned in 20 mins. In addition, though we were on non-smoking floors on both occasions, we could smell smoke all the time, waking up with dry throats and coughs. On sharing this with a local friend, he told me that the drains in Prat Avenue and Hart Avenue have always been smelly. It's not just my hotel. On one of the nights, we ate at the restaurant next to the hotel - Al Dente (excellent food by the way and very good price, amazing!), we got the same smell coming from the hallway leading to the kitchen!!! So, my conclusion is that - this is not the hotel's fault, it's a problem of the area. The location is wonderful, the streets in the neighbourhood are lined with pubs, restaurants, convenience stores, new malls and whatever else you can think of, it's wonderful if you don't mind the smell!!

The hotel staff: very helpful (one pulled my suitcase to the end of Prat Ave to show us the exact location of the bus stop) and English speaking. (Before arriving to HK, I emailed back and forth with the staff regarding tedious details, and I so appreciated a response, for one, and timely, too!) Small lobby, but who spends time in the lobby??? Loved the free internet access in the rooms, although not wireless. When booking on the hotel's website, I requested, thanks to a previous review, a non-smoking superior room, away from the elevator, on the back side of the hotel away from the street, on a higher floor (in order to avoid the reported street noise), and my request was fulfilled - well sort of. They \"upgraded\" me to a deluxe room (little larger than superior, w/ microwave and mini-fridge - no complaints about this) on the exact opposite end of the elevator, 12th floor (room 1207), but the only downside is that I was on the street side facing G. Hotel. I was prepared for the street noise, mild for the most part, used ear plugs so I had no problem, but my friend, a light sleeper, wasn't as pleased. Enjoyed the room, very clean, perfect size, bathroom was great with soaking tub and separate shower (loved the shower head, but yes, the water temp can flucuate and scald you, so be careful). The A/C was a little cool but needed to be on to circulate the slightly smokey air wafting in from the hall. For flat-sheet loving people, the bed has a fitted sheet with a duvet covered comforter but no flat sheet. To solve the problem, my friend asked the room maid for an extra duvet cover.

Surrounded by a Karaoke bar and a few restaurants beside it, I was very surprised at how modern and clean it was once I stepped in. The air conditioning was a much needed welcome along in the strong cologne-smelling lobby which I had no issues with. Both the bell hop and staff at the front desk were very delicate and polite giving ample suggestions on our situation (our rooms were not quite ready). My room, although largest on the floor, was very spacious including an in shelf microwave and smoked sliding closet. The glass shower stall could fit at least 4 people. Each room has a small LCD and access to a DVD player and twenty some channels to view. I did find, however, that turning up the heat (from a default of 15 degrees celcius) causes moisture build up and an eventual mold smell in the room which can be corrected by turning down the heat. The other complaint I had was the shower water temperatures were never consistent. It would be warm then extremely hot which I had to turn down the temeperature which would eventually turn cold all of a sudden. This hotel provided a small gym which had enough equipment to do cardio and weights. A nice touch was Butterfly on the Pratt offers complimentary umbrella's in the case of rain. Booking tours (We did the 360 Lan Tau tour) was simple and straight forward. The same goes for check-out procedure. The lobby always provided maps and suggestions on locations of local attractions. There was at least 4 MTR station entrances which was a godsend since the MTR is the lifeblood of this city.

You can eat toast, jam, butter, cereals and drink milk or juice as much as you want. The downside is that they served breakfast at the basement, using a Japanese style bar. So, if you are early for breakfast, you'll still find cigarette butts and leftover drinks and food and dirty tables and floor. The breakfast place was very dark in contrast to the hotel rooms. I find it inappropriate to use this place that looks like a dungeon. However, the lady serving us was very friendly and courteous. I hope the hotel management can find a better place where they can serve breakfast. On the small lobby beside the elevator are 2 computers where you can use it for free, maybe just to check for emails. They have no toilet on the ground floor which means you have to go up to your room if suddenly you feel like using it.

It is also very close to Nathan Road where most of the major shopping malls are. The rooms were very clean and somewhat small. However, there was enough space for me to put a queen sized air mattress in front of the queen sized bed. I booked the Deluxe room which was why there was enough space. The Superior room loses the space in front of the bed which is a little larger than a queen sized bed. The shower takes a considerable amount of space in the bathroom, but the bathroom did not feel cramped at all. The bed was comfortable, but the pillows were way too soft. The service was good. Everybody was friendly and they always showed a bright smile as we walked in. Service was fast. What I don't like is that they don't have luggage trolley.

We ate at the Italian restaurant Al Dente which is located just off the lobby. It was very nice and the food was very good, which was evidenced by the fact that every table was full on a Tuesday night at 10 pm. It was reasonably priced, with the two of us eating with app for around 330HK ($40 US). Check in was a breeze after booking and paying for my room on Orbitz (for only $83 US). The room was very clean and, while not large, had plenty of room for my gf and I. It looked newly renovated and included a flatscreen, dvd player, large fridge, microwave, and free WIFI. The bathroom was large and clean also, but be prepared it does have smoked glass doors which can be see through. The best part of the room was the bed and linens. The bed was very soft and comfy and the pillows were perfect, both a rarity in Asia. The only thing that I would do different next time is request a room at the end of the hallway on a high floor. We were on floor 13, and could still hear some road noise. Also, we were given the room directly opposite the elevator (maybe 6 ft away) and heard a few drunken tourists arriving late into the morning. We still slept well though because of the great bed! One last note, upon check in I asked the single doorman if there would be taxi's available at 7 am the next morning and he assured me he would personally have one waiting. I assumed he meant he would call and reserve one. When we rolled out of the elevator the next morning the same bellman grabbed our luggage and had it loaded in the taxi before we even completed the check out process.

We were impressed to receive an extensive and very well organized World Cup schedule on the first days of the games. It's so nice we took it home to continue following from the US! Were also pleasantly suprised that they had movies you could borrow for free which was great for a couple of rainy days. Some tips--there is a great Western-style grocery store called Jason's at K:11 a shopping area a block or two away and with the fridge and microwave this can be a great way to save. There is a Chinese grocery store on the same block below a horse race betting place across the street. Our favorite restaurant for food and service was hands-down Two Thousand Villages Thia/Vietnamese Restaurant on the same block (same side).

Ten persons, including 3 kids 10 years old and below. While we initially had problems with checking in - the rooms were supposed to be available by noon, then 2PM, then 3PM, the front desk staff were generally patient and friendly. We finally got our rooms set up almost 5PM as there were requests for extra beds. Main reason for the delay was that the hotel was booked full the previous night, although I think it was the lack of housecleaning staff that aggravated it. Butterfly on Prat is primarily ideal for couples, or those without children. There are about a dozen rooms on each floor, and children running along the corridors can be quite noisy. Make sure you request for a room on the higher floors, as the street downstairs can be noisy with cars honking their horns loudly when there's traffic along Prat Ave. There are a few convenience stores less than 3 minutes walk away, and you can buy food supplies and snacks as the rooms provide a refrigerator (empty) and microwave. The hotel provides 2 bottles of distilled water (380 ml) daily, but it is recommended you buy your own at 7-11 to refill in case these aren't enough as Hong Kong is hot and humid in May. Some pet peeves... not all rooms have opaque glass panels in the bathroom door and the bathroom itself...out of the 3 rooms, one had clear glass panels (!!!) instead of the opaque panels...which is exactly the reason why the place is ideal for couples or individual travelers. It is quite a hassle to ask the hotel staff to paste Manila paper on the clear panels for the occupants' privacy. Another reason this is suited for couples is that the room is quite small, and adding an extra bed doesn't allow much moving space. Among the hotel staff, the front desk personnel (especially the ladies) are the most professional. They speak good English and are courteous. However, it would be difficult to make requests from the housekeeping staff as most of them barely speak English except the basics - \"Thank you, good morning, etc.\". Along Prat Avenue, there are a few reasonably priced Chinese, Vietnamese and Thai restaurants that serve great tasting food...the best bargains are during mid-day as they offer specials that include meals plus drinks. Overall, if you don't expect too much from an establishment like this compared to full service hotels, Butterfly on Prat is considered value-for-money.", "Date": "May 31, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Lewisburg, PA", "Title": "\u201cAwesome value, very nice hotel\u201d", "Author": "dave_jacobson", "ReviewID": "UR65601237", "Content": "I just got back from a four day vacation with my wife, kids, and parents.

I think I can agree on everything said in all the reviews, , including the weird smell in the lobby. However..... Checked in on a Friday afternoon after arriving by rail from Dongguan. 2 minute cab ride - a breeze. Dropped off on the street, not a problem. 10 meter walk to the lobby door. No staff to open the door for me. Narrow stiff doors were kind of akward. Got in, dropped bags, stepped right up and checked in. Only to find that...they were full. But, I had a reservation! No problem. They had a room waiting for me, it was the largest in the hotel, room 1808. That's a suite. That's right. Walk in, look left, bedroom. Look straight ahead, KITCHEN! Look Right, living room. Even had a little breakfast table. AMAZING. The bathroom was I am sure larger than most in the hotel. Clean, clean, clean, and after an all day worth of meetings and rail travel, that shower looked great. Shampoo was citrus and the best smelling hotel shampoo I've come across in 15 years of Asia travel. Sound like a small, dumb detail? Try some shampoo that smells like a mixture of gasoline and rice wine and you come to appreciate the little things like a nice smelling shampoo. Water pressure was great. Flat screen in the bedroom. Flat screen in the living room. No utensils nor glasses, as you would find in the kitchen of let's say a Residence Inn by Mariott - but this is Hong Kong ! Who would need a kitchen? Noise? Forget about it! 18 floors up. I was out cold anyway from such a long trip. And SOFT bedding. Never got to eat at the adjacent resturant called Al Dente. Will next time.

I booked a 3-day stay for just over $300 US, so I'm not quite sure why some reviewers claimed it's expensive. For a great location in the heart of a major city, I consider this to be quite reasonable. It's only a couple blocks away from the Tsim Sha Tsui MTR station on Nathan Rd as well as Kowloon Park. Lots of restaurants nearby with a couple convenience store as well for the off-hours. Anyway, checked in and was told I had been upgraded to a deluxe room. It was clean, modern and quite spacious with a microwave and fridge. Free movies to borrow to your room. 10% discount to the restaurant next door (didn't partake). As for the negatives, first, I was right across the elevators so I could hear people talking while getting on/off, as well as the constant \"ding, dong\" of arriving at the floors. Not too big of a deal though. The other thing is that I was on the street side of the building. Prat is a pretty lively street at night with some small bars. Friday and Saturday night especially, there was a lot of noise coming from the street below (people yelling, cars honking, etc.), and I was on the 11th floor. Can't imagine what it would have been like on a lower floor. But again, wasn't too big of a deal for me. If you're a light/early sleeper, be sure to request a room on the back side of the building!

While checked in to the hotel, the male staff at the counter was very polite to us. We were there at around 1pm, but the room was not ready yet, so the staff asked us to come back after 2pm. As we have 2 haversacks, the staff offered to keep them behind the counter. We felt that it should be quite safe to put our luggage inside the hotel rather than outside as we noticed that the hotel would park most of the luggage outside the hotel. When we entered the room after 2pm, it was clean, neat and as expected it was not spacious and the bathroom was a totally can see through glass. It seems suitable for couple, but ops, some might concern if sharing the room with someone. The window view was unpleasant as it was facing the back of an old building. Prior to our check out, we would give this hotel a rating that slightly above the average with that amount we paid. However, we have downgraded our rating for this hotel as we were quite disappointed with the service provided by a lady staff during our checked out . When we checked out at 11.30am, we requested the lady staff to look after our haversacks as we were having an evening flight and so, we requested to put them behind the counter as we can see there was still some empty space behind it. However, she insisted us to put our haversacks outside the hotel. Even though we raised our concerns that we felt uncomfortable to put our haversacks outside the hotel as unlike other bulky luggage that parked outside the hotel, our haversacks seems more easily grabbed by public. In fact, we explained that the haversacks won't take up much space if put behind the counter, however, she still refused to let us to put them inside by telling us she needs to reserve the space for other coming customers. We felt that the staff suddenly changed her attitude and become so inflexible after the billing has been done. The service provided seems totally different from the day we checked in where the staff offered us to keep our baggage inside the hotel lobby. However once we have settled the bill, it seems that the service was ended there, and the priority would not be given to us anymore. After a while of negotiation, the lady staff gave in unwillingly and with harsh tone to let us to put the haversacks behind the counter.

Not only was this place just what I was looking for, but my stay was enhanced by all of your recommendations. Notes: 1. Take the Airport Express Train from the airport to Kowloon station, then catch the free K3 shuttle, get off at the first stop (about a 12-15 minute ride) walk back in the direction the shuttle came from, take a right, then another right onto Prat and the hotel is on your left, across the street from the Guang Dong hotel. 2. I requested a quiet room on a high floor, at the back and away from the elevator--and that's exactly what they had reserved for me. 3. I was prepared for a tiny room, given some of the comments here. What I found was a room small by American standards, but not much smaller than an average Asian or European room. 4. The free Internet with my offer worked great all the time. 5. The Tao Hueng dim sum place just a couple of blocks away was excellent. (I was the only Caucasian in the whole place, usually a good sign.) Very reasonable and excellent food. 6. A good Vietnamese place just down the street and the First Cup in the other direction both give 10% off if you show your Butterfly Club card the hotel gives you--and the First Cup serves a good full English breakfast all day long. 7. For a break from Asian food there's German pub just down the street with several Pilsners on draught and some very good Nuremburg sausages with sauerkraut. 8. I found the Airport Express ticket that includes three days of unlimited travel on the MRT very handy. The three days don't start till the day you first use the card for the MRT, not including your ride in on the Airport Express. 9. Oh yes, back to the hotel, the bathrooms are good size with a large shower with a good, adjustable shower head. 10. The whole place is clean and modern. My standard (\"\"superior\") room had a fridge and a microwave, complimentary coffee, tea and two bottles of mineral water left every day, a desk with a broadband outlet and cable, a luggage rack, a good size closet with lots of wooden hangers, a safe and plenty of storage space. 10.

I would suggest carrying a street map though so you can sort out which way to walk once you get off the free shuttle as we wondered for a bit and everybody, including our shuttle driver, gave us the wrong directions. We tried to check-in a couple of hours early but were not able to. Instead the bellman gave us the suggestion to have dim sum breakfast at a nearby restaurant and it was absolutely amazing and cheap! The best food we had in Hong Kong. (To get there, take a left out of BOP, right onto Camarvon Road and it will be in the building just past the bank on the left hand side, take the elevator up to the restaurant.) Once we checked into the hotel, we were upgraded for free. Our room was on the 10th floor and small, as we expected. I can't even imagine how small the regular rooms are. The room seemed very clean, bed was comfortable the decor was modern. Shower was big enough for 3 people. There was also a microwave and fridge. The only problems we had was the noise from the karaoke bar downstairs until 4am and the lack of a black-out curtain (bring an eyemask). We received 2 free water bottles on the first day only. There are 2 free laptops in the lobby which we used to get restaurant suggestions on TripAdvisor :) I highly recommend this hotel. Helpful Staff. Good Area.

The room was quite nice with a comfortable queen bed, television with international channels, a good sized closet, a microwave, a refrigerator, and a FANTASTIC shower. The hotel itself is new and clean with a contemporary feel to it. The staff is quite nice and helpful, although there seemed to be some confusion about when the subways run. That said, the service was typically excellent. For example, a bellman went out of his way to make sure we made it to the nearby K3 bus to the airport. One note: if taking a taxi in from the airport, it helps to have the directions to the hotel printed out (in Cantonese preferably) as many of the taxi drivers do not yet know the hotel or Prat Avenue. Previous reviews cited a concern about a window to the bathroom: No worries, there are now blinds covering the windows although bathroom doors are quite thin. A note on clothing tailors: We followed a friend's suggestion and a guidebook to nearby Sammy's Tailor and were somewhat disappointed. While competent, the staff did not want to get all of the details correct. If you have been to a top quality tailor, you will not be pleased. For my boyfriend's suit jacket, he was not given a choice of styles and the quality of the liners first offered was like that of a coat bought in a bus station. We had to ask, and pay extra for, a decent lining. For my suit, the staff was not interested in getting the details perfect- They kept arguing that an improper drape or loose fabric was supposed to be that way, but any girl knows better. My off-the-rack suit from Theory fits better than this custom one, even after additional alterations were made when I got home. Their attitude was more that they were doing us a favor by being there.

The room was small (which wasn't necessarily bad, just worth mentioning) and linens were ragged--some minor stains on the white comforter and the towels were shredding on the sides in the bathroom. (The ragged linens bothered me far more than the size of the room.) The hotel seems like it's going to be huge and gorgeous based on the website, but it's not. The lobby area is very small. The staff were helpful enough, though the English spoken was so-so. I couldn't believe no one had mentioned that the \"free\" shuttle bus to the airport express isn't actually at the hotel--you have to walk with all of your luggage to a stop down the block, around a corner, and down another block to get to it. Plus, the bus never even showed after we did all that, so we wound up in a taxi afterall. Taxi to the station is definitely the way to go and then the airport express from there. You can check your luggage at the airport express station, so that's the best route. The hotel was noisy with construction outside, even though we were on the 10th floor. The area was clubby and there was a lot happening for expats--if that's your scene, great. If not, then it's definitely not the area for you. The hotel is within a quick walk to the metrostation. I'd say it's great for people on a budget who want a clean hotel and who plan on spending most of their time out of the room anyway. For us, this hotel was the last stop on a 24 day trip all over China, so we were probably ready for a bit more luxury. However, considering the prices in Hong Kong, you definitely don't spend as much for this hotel as you would for others in the area. The hotel provides free computers in the lobby with internet access which is a huge plus. There's room service, but a very small, select menu. Laundry in the hotel is expensive.

My grouses: Slippers werent provided. I almost wear slippers around hotel rooms as I feel most guests walk ard the rooms with their foot wear which made me very uncomfortable as to exactly what I was stepping on before I hop onto bed. Hence, I was a little perturbed as to why this wasn't provided. Secondly, the 2 complimentary water bottles provided were only applicable on day 1. I find this a little stingy as most hotels and Im not talking bout 5star hotels actually supply their guests with a daily replenishment of complimentary water. I did call reception to enquire on the 2nd day and on 3rd day, they replenished it for me after which I had already bought 2 huge bottles from 7-11 (waste of time and money). Thirdly, outgoing calls to Hong Kong numbers were chargable at HKD5 per 15mins block. My friends in HK told me usually this is not the case. More often than not, outgoing local calls were complimentary. Even their local mobile calls were free. So I did not get why BOP wanted to charge us. Fourthly, location. It's a double-edged sword here. The location is good, within 5 mins walking distance to MTR but noise at night is really undesirable. The honking of cars and clubbers swearing, cursing, yelling and beer bottles being thrown around could be heard way into the night even when I'm staying on the highest floor! Fifthly, room cleanliness. The towels were clean but they appeared like they have been used umpteen times, a bit dirty looking. I think more bleaching needs to be done. We told the reception to change our towels on the 2nd day and when we returned later in the night, ONLY the towels were changed. The bed was not made and toilet was the way we left it in the morning. I wonder if they misunderstood us. On 1 of the days, we left the room at 10am in the morning. When we decided to return at 1plus in the noon to put down our goodies, the room was still not made even when we did hang the makeup room tag. I was quite surprised there.

Are you kidding me? there is no such thing as too far from public transit in HK! it is so close to MTR, even a disabled person can crawl to the nearest MTR is less than 10 mins.. so people, don't lie.. use google map and do your homework..or pick a hotel that is built above an mtr station! 3. room is dirty, no clean towels: that is BS, just call the front desk, tell them, and they will fix it...this is a hotel, the maids are not your mom.. 4. area too busy: i would rather stay in a area that is busy and people are still walking on the street 2am .. you know why? that means that area is safe! 5.

I had initially (on reading reviews on this site) booked the hotel for three nights; later on a friend's recommendation and also from hotel reviews I booked \" The Mira\" on TST; and thank heavens for that. We still booked this hotel for one night between our trip to Macau and our stay at Disney. The hotel staff tells you its a less than 5 mins walk from the MTR but be ready for at least a 10 min walk through a not so good lane. The hotel rooms are SMALL we just had 2 cabin bags and there was hardly enough space to fit those in. The room was freezing cold, though there is a temperature control it didnt seem to work, the room was equally freezing at 30deg as it was at 18 deg celcius. On requesting the staff for another room the only solution they could come up with was to turn off the aircon.. on telling them it would be suffocating they sent us blankets... Can some one explain to them people dont sleep in the room always ( or maybe thats the kind of clientele this hotel gets). Finally they gave us heaters to heat the room which made matters worse. Lets talk about the rooms... the bath room has a transparent door... but that does not serve any purpose apart from your roommate getting a clear view of you answering nature calls. It is not in the line of sight of the television which is the primary purpose for having transparent bathroom walls. The bathroom was dirty had hair and grout everywhere. The towels were dirty. The curtains were torn and had stains. The room looked into the building in front so you had to keep the curtains shut at all times. There are some good points on this hotel though... it is in a bylane of TST so lots of eating and shopping options around. It has a small microwave in the room which definately helps people who have dietary restrictions. I did not have the inclination to try any of its other facilities and checked out at 9AM. BoP is like an very expensive student's boarding. I would suggest if you are spening over HK$900 per night ( thats what I paid); pay HK$100 more and get a better hotel...

Previous reviews are correct; the transparent and un-lockable toilet door can be quiet a problem. I find the toilet sink a little too shallow, water keeps spilling out of the sink, making a mess on the counter which I really didn\u2019t quite like. During my stay many of the common hotel room amenities were missing, I have to called housekeeping for my bedroom slippers, toothbrush, etc; this was not a good experience when you came back into the room late in the night to find missing amenities. The walls were paper thin; I can constantly hear the opening and closing of doors as well as the TV shows my neighbors were watching, not a pleasant experience when you\u2019re trying to get some sleep.

Normally our hotel choice is very well researched and booked months in advance, but on this occasion we had to make a very quick decision. We chose BoP on the strength of the reviews here and the Tsim Sha Tsui location, and we were not disappointed! BoP appears to be part of the small, growing Butterfly chain. The hotel guest facilities are minimal (on site-gym, restaurant and free internet via 2 laptops in the lobby) and the lobby is tiny, but that is the reason why this hotel offers incredible value for money. If BoP had more extensive facilities then this hotel would be charging much higher prices in line with the 4 star type places we have stayed before in other cities, which offer more facilities but the rooms were far less attractive than BoP. We booked via Agoda which seemed to be offering the best rates for our stay. We stayed in a standard room and whilst it was small (but reasonable by HK standards from what I understand here), the space was maximised and the room was equipped with everything we needed for a city break base, although an iron would have been useful (I'm sure if we had requested it from reception we would have got an iron, as they were very helpful). The room had a microwave for those wanting to rustle up a quick snack, but we didn't see the need as the hotel was surrounded by bars, cafes / restaurants and had a 7-Eleven store at the street corner. As mentioned by other reviewers, the hotel is either new or has recently been refurbished this year, so the room fixtures and fittings are new. I read a review here suggesting problems with the Air Conditioning; we had no such problems. The A/C was excellent which was essential for us being 2 Scots visiting HK in peak summer humidity. In terms of the location, it was perfect for us tourists. We found our barings very quickly and really welcomed being close to TST MTR station (and its link to East TST MTR), not just for travel but for using the air conditioned underground passages to escape the summer humidity. BoP is on Prat Avenue and is part of a triangle of streets which has various late night bars, restaurants, cafes, etc. We had no problems with the noise at all. I read here that this area could be intimidating at night, but I would disagree with this. We came back to the hotel pretty late during our stay and didn't consider safety to be an issue at all. Please note that the Airport Express bus no longer stops opposite BoP at the Guandong Hotel, but it does stop a couple streets away at the Park Hotel. A very quick walk, even with luggage (and I don\u2019t travel light). Overall, I would highly recommend Butterfly on Prat as an excellent base for a city break / sightseeing visit to Hong Kong. As first time visitors it met our needs perfectly and the price represents exceptional value for money.

The Internet is free and pretty fast although wired LAN only, no wifi, however they do also have 2 laptops in reception for customers use. This place is without question the best value for money you will find in Hong Kong, Sunday to Thursday anyway as Friday and saturday the price jumps a bit. We would have given it a perfect score, but our only issue was with the humidity in the room. The carpet and bedding felt damp all the time due to the humidity in the Hong Kong air, we spoke to reception and they showed us 2 other rooms, but they were exactly the same. We eventually had to use a heater and the A/C!!!!! Not very Environmentally friendly, to try and solve the problem. I wasn't so bothered by it, but my wife was. The staff did go out of their way to help solve the issue though and we still had a great stay. We would just recommend that the hotel invest in a few De-humidifiers for the guests that really need them. Highly recommend this place though.

Distance to Cameron Road: 200m or approx 2 mins walk Distance to Granville Road: 500m or approx 5 mins walk Distance to Nathan Road: 500m or approx 5 mins walk Distance to Macau-China Ferry Terminal: Not sure how long but its approx 15 mins walk Distance to Star Ferry Terminal: Approx 10 mins walk Distance to Avenue of Star: Approx 10 mins walk There are plenty of eateries around the hotels and all are reasonably priced. Please take note if you are a small eater cos their portion is big. It is also a shopping haven esp in Granville Road where you can find many hip shops selling the latest fashion clothings. For the upmarket shopping, Nathan Road is close by, so it Habour City. Taxi is not a prob. There is always no lack of one at the doorstep. A number of KTV lounges surrounding the hotel as well but be assured that its not those sleazy KTV pubs \u2013 at least its not sleazy looking outside. Should you have the hunger prangs in the middle of the night, eateries are opened till approx 2am and 7-11 and K-Circle is conveniently located 100m away from the hotel. Overall, I would say I am very satisfied with my choice of hotel and it is definitely worth the money paid for (less than S$100 per night).

As a previous poster said, the decor is cheerful, which makes it a nice place to stay. Bed/sheets/pillows all comfortable and clean, water pressure was great.

I think that is standard for most hotels and it was considerable more reasonably priced than at some other hotels. (Note: there was an unsecured network I was able to access from most everywhere in Hong Kong free of charge). -The see-through bathroom is only the really big minus for me (and it would be so easy to fix, Butterfly! Even if you just sprayed the frost glass stuff over the windows). I was staying alone, so it wasn't a big deal, but I'm not sure if I would really want to stay here with anyone I didn't feel entirely comfortable sharing all of my bathroom habits with (and that is no one). -I had my laptop, so again, not a problem for me, but the little area where you could access a computer in the lobby didn't look particularly comfortable. -There was still noticeable street noise and I was in a higher level room. With earplugs, it wasn't a problem. -The curtains/blinds are relatively see through as well, so the light shines in your room in the morning, which can be a problem if you're recovering from jet lag or if you sleep during the day. Again, I travel with an eye cover, so this wasn't really a problem for me. Overall, I enjoyed my stay at the Butterfly very much, and if traveling alone again, I will definitely stay here again.

When you arrive at the hotel there is always someone to greet you at the door. When you walk into the lobby you'll notice a really unique (and very pleasant) smell. Check in both times for me has been quick and smooth. One time, my partner and I didn't have our passports as we had already been to the visa office but we had no trouble checking in with other photo id and by presenting the credit card i booked with (along with the booking receipt). Also recently, we arrived early (around 10.30am) and they checked us in straight away even though check in is usually at 2pm AND upgraded us! I've stayed in both the deluxe and superior rooms. I can't say there is much difference between the two other than the view. I think the website states there is about a 5 sq m difference or so but I hardly noticed that. Since the hotel only opened last December everything still seems new. I thought the room size was generous for HK. You might think it is small, but remember hotel rooms are generally tiny in HK (and i have stayed in some tiny rooms there!) so you'll just have to take my word on it. The queen size bed is one of the softest i have slept in (in HK), the pillows are also soft. If you need firm pillows for a good nights rest this is not the place for you. Like another reviewer pointed out the only problem with the rooms are the bathroom windows. Since my first stay, they have installed a blind on the clear glass window; however, the sliding door still has uncovered clear panels. But if you're not entering/exiting or using the wardrobe at the time someone is on the crapper you shouldn't have a problem. The room comes with en empty mini bar fridge. Which is great as you can lots of things in there if you need. The room also comes with a kettle, microwave, tea, coffee and a dvd player. The bathroom amenities include shower cap, vanity kit, sanitary bag, shampoo, conditioner, lotion and bath gel of which the last four smell divine. However, I noticed there are no toothbrushes provided, so it would be a good idea to remember to bring your own or by one at the local 7/11. The hotel has a small gym; however, i can't comment as I have yet to have time to inspect it. There are also two restaurants, one Japanese and one Russian. As the hotel is located on Prat Avenue there is lots to do. I'll just list a few things we found convenient. The MTR is about a 5min walk to the hotel, if you take exit A2. There are about 2 or 3 7/11's along your way. I also noticed 2 ATMs which gave you the choice of withdrawing RMB or HK dollars - great if you're from China or heading into China. We normally enjoy eating at one of the Indian restaurants in the area but I also like the soup from DeliFrance which you can find on the corner of Prat Avenue about 1 min walk from the hotel. Harbour City shopping mall also is a short 10min walk from the hotel. If you get a chance visit Kowloon Park (which is on your way to Harbour City). It's a huge public garden with many surprises. I highly recommend it if you have a free couple hours. Lastly, there is some construction going on outside the front of the hotel at this time. I had no trouble sleeping in past 10am. However, if you are a light sleeper this might bother you. More to add: - The staff are exceptional!! - There are two laptops in the lobby for guests to use with internet. I found they came in handy many times! - Use 'travelasia.com' to book.

I think the superior rooms are in fact slightly better even if they face the back of old apartment buildings as they are more quiet than the deluxe rooms which face Prat Avenue. The pubs and restaurants lining Prat Avenue can get really busy until after midnight and we were awakened by a combination of noisy pub crawlers and honking taxi cabs at around 3 a.m. I'm not sure if it would make any difference if one is booked at a higher floor because the noise along Prat Avenue can get really bad at times. I will book a Superior room next time to ensure a more peaceful sleep. Other than this noise issue (which is really not the hotel's fault), there is nothing to criticize about the hotel.

The hotel provides broadband connectivity although this is chargeable - there is no wi-fi provided. However, the hotel provides residents with the free use of two laptops in the lobby area. The bathroom was reasonably sized with a roomy shower cubicle. The only drawback for some maybe the lack of privacy for the bathroom due to use of clear panels thoughout. The bed linen and bathroom towels were changed daily which is pleasing although not environmentally friendly. Although the rooms were cleaned daily, I would suggest that the attention to detail needs to be greater as dust in crevices were missed and stains left by cups were still evident on the main in my room. My room also seemed to occasionally draw in the smell of cigarettes although it's unclear whether this was via the air conditioning or otherwise. Then there was the lack of consideration of other residents on this floor with the noise from children as they returned for the day, the general slamming of doors and the banging of one resident's door by a drunken resident! The first of these occured at times through my stay whilst the other issues occurred during the second half of my stay. Staff were efficient and courteous.

The area is also well served with eateries of all types, numerous 7-11 shops, and bars.
