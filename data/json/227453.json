Transfers from the airport are quick (20 mins) and reasonably priced (approx 25Euro). However take the address with you so the driver can put it in his GPS as many taxi drivers dont know it. I have stayed at this Hotel 5 times over the past 3 years as i have regular business travel to this part of Madrid. The convenience of being able to walk to the office draws me back. Not to say that staying there is a hardship - it isnt - but you can get more atmospheric hotels nearer the city centre. This hotel is modern and clean but is rather soul-less. Lets just say that you wouldnt go there for a romantic weekend!! The rooms are old fashioned and on the small side. Beds are comfy but have blankets rather than duvets. Pillows are the Spanish 'sausage roll type' and are hard; however other pillows are available on request. There are 2 English channel TV programs - CNN and a sports channel. However WiFi is free and seemed fairly speedy. Essential for a business hotel. The reception staff are friendly and efficient, with a good level of English. However i struggled with the bar staff who couldnt understand me. As i live in Dubai and am on 3 hours time difference, i find the kitchen not opening in an evening until 8pm (11pm my time) a huge inconvenience. Basic sandwiches are offered before then, however if you want a hot meal from room service before then - no chance! There is a small bar with tables and some saggy floral sofas, which seems to be frequented by locals of the area. The house wine is very good and competitively priced. (2.3 Euro for a glass of red, with nuts!) As a woman in there alone i feel safe and at ease. There is a balcony for the warmer months - but with not much of a view. Breakfast is served in the dining room - the Spanish tortilla is lovely! Definately worth a try. Coffee is awful. Avoid. Fruit is usually tasty. To summarise, if i could give it 3.5 out of 5 I would do. Its slightly better than average - but cant be classed as very good! It must be OK as I keep going back there. There is a small parade of shops at the back of the hotel with a pharmacy. Also a couple of restaurants which I havent tried. There is a metro station a distance away - just about walking distance - but dont do it alone in the dark. I found it scary.", "Date": "February 29, 2012"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Villamadrid Hotel", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g187514-d227453-Reviews-Villamadrid_Hotel-Madrid.html", "Price": "$59 and up*", "Address": "<address><span rel=\"v:address\"><span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">C/ Xaudaro 2</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:postal-code\">28034</span> <span property=\"v:locality\">Madrid</span></span>, <span class=\"country-name\" property=\"v:country-name\">Spain</span> </span></span></address>", "HotelID": "227453", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/ProviderThumbnails/dirs/92/af/92afa59b259601591189b8035b1299d84large.jpg"}}
