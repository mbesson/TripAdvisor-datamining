We booked the Bosphorus view room and the view was really amazing. The room was big and very comfortable. Hotel is located in the center of Istanbul and you can travel around the whole city very easily, and just a few steps from Taksim Square and Istiklal street where you can enjoy from Istanbul night life. By walking 10 min you can reach the metro system of the city, same time you can reach the tram system & central bus station. Next of the Hotel you can find a lots of restaurants, shops, pharmacy and etc. Our room was well equipped and clean with amazing balcony view to Bosphorus. Also the bathroom was good & well equipped. The wireless (WI-FI) internet connection worked perfectly. The room was cleaning everyday. The breakfast was excellent with the plenty of options. No Comments...............! All hotel employees and Reception Desk are very gentle, helpful and friendly. They are always ready to help us with any queries. I recommend this hotel to everybody.

We had a great view over the Bosphorus (room 502). Everything was nice and clean, and staff were lovely. Don't use the mini bar. Empty it out and get what you need for a fraction of the price at the local mart, which will sell you everything, including beer and wine. Breakfast was included in the hotel price. It was fine...not flash but they had what I like..eggs, toast, sausages, lots of cheese and salad choices, good coffee. Halas! We walked to the main shopping area in 5 minutes, and got a cab to the touristy places we wanted to see. I had previously been to Istanbul and stayed over the other side. If I go back, I think I would go to this side again. It was just so busy, lots of ordinary people going to work every day. We liked the restaurants and loved stopping for a beer, Effes.

I was very inpressed by some of the reviews and a bit turned off by others. Unfortunately my stay there was more on the side of the the reviewers that weren't happy. Great Location granted. I didn't see any swimming pool yet they have a pic of one under \"Activities\"? 31 rooms with garden/city or Sea view. A wall opposite isn't exactly my idea of a garden. Room was tiny. You would open the door and it hit against the strange mattress of the tiny supposed double bed. Walking in this room was difficult as it's so small. Very, very noisy with the sirens, car horns and noisy city folk below. There are 2 hospitals nearby so that's where the sirens kept going/coming to. People in Istanbul seem to use the horn as if it's an essential part of driving. My room was located next to the cleaners room. The banging and noise that was made daily, was really quite annoying. Heating far too hot and no place that you could switch it off yourself. Room wasn't too bad, old carpet and definitely the website enhances it's true worthiness. I could not get the tv to work whatsoever. I'm no dummy but the instruction on how to use the 2 remote control seem to pass by me. Nothing could get it to work. Staff were ok, they weren't friendly how a lot of ppl here say they are. Location is very good because it's 2 mins walk across the road to Istiklal st. You can get breakfast for around 7 euro but i chose most days to go to cafes in the area. I had the breakfast on one occasion it was ok.

It was our honeymoon trip and we wanted the best of everything, and at the same time be not too extravagant. So, we started our search back in June/July on the internet. We narrowed down to 4-5 hotels and finally called up Butik Star. We asked for a deluxe room with a balcony and Bosphorus view. Since it was off season, we got a good rate for our choice. And for that rate, if you compare with other hotels, the room was really good. It was quite big - appropriate for a deluxe room, had proper lighting, cupboards, electric plugs, curtains... The balcony had a table for two and the view from there was really really amazing. The bathroom was clean and had a good shower system. Buffet breakfast was served everyday from 7 to 10 am and had a huge variety of things to choose from. However, the menu was fixed and it was the same throughout our 10 day trip. The hotel staff is not too vast, so you get to know everyone by 2-3 days. They were all friendly and approachable. One of the best things about this hotel was its location. Its in the Taksim area near Taksim square, hardly 5 minutes walk from the main subway and funikular system, which is a huge advantage considering the taxi rates over there. A lot of good cheap restaurants are also in the proximity like Bambi Cafe. Istiklal Caddessi is like 3 mins away from the hotel, which is a huge huge advantage. We used to go there every night after 8pm when we were done sight-seeing other parts of Istanbul. There were a few drawbacks of this hotel. The staff is very friendly, but almost all of them do not comprehend english very well, which was an obstacle to us when we wanted something which was out of the normal routine. Although the room was cleaned each and every day, we noticed that after 3 days they stopped providing us bath towels and bathroom slippers (maybe they ran out of them or something). The water that came in the washbasin was lukewarm, not hot, as we would have liked it... however the shower didn't have that problem. The bathroom walls were very thin, every now and then we would clearly hear our neighbours go to the toilet, and I'm sure they would have heard us too - not really what we were expecting. The cupboard had a safebox so our passports and money was very safe. Since the staff is not too much at the hotel, sometimes the room service was slow. But they were courteous so it wasn't a big issue. The area around the hotel is pretty upbeat so many different shops are there. The money changers are a little costly as compared to other places like Sultanahmet or Beyazid. My advice to the tourists who are young and full of fun is to book this hotel early on, and get the deluxe room if possible. The best thing is the hot and happening Istiklal street and the proximity to the subway/funikular/tram system. The staff is really friendly and always at your service. If we ever get to visit turkey again we will definitely stay here.", "Date": "January 22, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Amsterdam, The Netherlands", "Title": "\u201cBest location best people!..\u201d", "Author": "Aye G", "ReviewID": "UR123248873", "Content": "Its wonderful, clean in a perfect street of Istanbul, almost in the square of Taksim, walking down is metro, bridges (Galata) and very close to shopping areas, etc. The best view of the big rooms, you need to ask for a sea view, a bit more expensive rooms but it is worth to experience the mornings and evenings from these rooms! beautiful!

We flatly refused to take it and were shown to a more reasonable room - but it was still fairly small. And some of the items in the mini-bar were out of date.

According to the information on the web site the hotel had a car park though, which swayed my decision this way. However when I turned up with my car, I was told that their car par was undergoing refurbishment and was closed (I didn't believe in this story but anyway). I was asked to park in the carpark of the hotel next door at extra cost. The web site also mentioned swimming pool and gym, but having seen the hotel, I didn't even bother checking out these. Overall I was neither pleased nor largely disappointed. It's right in the hear of Taksim, relatively tidy and clean. Don't expect large rooms, as space is a luxury here. When you stay in this part of Istanbul, all you really need is comfortable accommodation and you can get it here. You are surrounded by bars and restaurants, that offer good food/drinks at reasonable prices. Would I go back to this hotel? No. I would rather pay a bit more and upgrade to a full size hotel.

I asked what else was available and I was told that the only thing available at this time was the room I had just seen, but I would have to pay the same price for this inferior room that I was to be paying for the superior room on my reservation. I simply received my refund and walked away (the benefit of living here full-time) but was forced to scrap my entire weekend of Christmas festivities. I could only imagine the sheer frustration that would have been mine had this been a reservation I had had when traveling to Turkey and not already living here. Upon further contact with the hotel manager the following week, ownership of the situation was not taken by the manager and no explanation or future arrangement was discussed. To me it seemed that they simply are not under the same impressions of responsibility and professionalism that we take for granted in the States and thus one unfortunately can't trust this hotel to ensure their reservation and smooth traveling experience.", "Date": "January 13, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "1", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Sleep Quality": "2", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Istanbul, Turkey", "Title": "\u201cThis is not a good value\u201d", "Author": "ilginius", "ReviewID": "UR92371070", "Content": "My hotel dates was 3-5 january.

They wanted our voucher etc etc but we had just booked through our work travel agent. They then asked for full payment before we had even seen the rooms! The room we both had was on the front so quite big, It was decorated very traditionally and could probably do with an update but it was clean - remember only 100 euros so you get what you pay for! There was free wifi in the room which was good but just 1 English channel. The hotel was right near Taksim square so its buzzing, you can eat almost all night and the shops are just 2 mins away. At night our rooms on the front were a bit noisy as at midnight there seemed to be parades, horns from cars and people! But at 9am it was quiet!

Room was large (for 3) with a nice - not gorgeous - view of Bosphorous, but it was very cool for April nights, so we asked for some heating, which unfortunately was not solved. 3-4 degrees more would have make the temperature perfect but it was not a very big issue and we managed with long-sleeve pijamas and C-vitamins for the throat! Staff was really kind and always ready to assist, but they were mainly prepared to answer standard questions with standard answers, suggesting mainly tour trips rather than being able to help for a tailor made tour. Breakfast is the worst part of the experience. It was pretty poor (boiled eggs with french fries!), with very limited choices and absolutely no change from one day to another, so if you stay more than 3 days, you will probably end up going out for breakfast. The big issue with breakfast is that the waiter there was not friendly at all, he did not care if we needed something (probably he did not speak english), he did not care about refilling the buffet and most of all he was checking permanently the watch to take everything out if the time limit for breakfast - 10 am was reached, even if there were many people in the breakfast room, who remained unasked if they wish anything before he closes the buffet. If breakast is until 10 am, I undrstand that eventually I can not go for breakfast at 10.01 am, depending of course by the attitude of the hosts towards their clients. However, NO WAY the restorant will close the buffet at 10 am sharp without asking existing guests if they still neeed anything to take! because if I arrived in time, 2 minutes before 10 am, I will not be able to take anyhing if they close it in 2 minutes! This gives a very bad feeling of being watched to consume as little as possible from the buffet and I strongly believe this should not be the way for them to make the profit, but the way the attract and keep their customers happy.

When we got into our room I immediately realized that it was not cleaned properly because I found peanuts on the floor. Another disadvantage was the noise. We could here everything that was going on in the corridor and most of the times in the next room! Also, the breakfast was poor and could barely make the european standards. Finally, on our departure they decided to charge us with some things that they claimed we used from the mini bar.

Just a few steps from Taksim Square and Istiklal street, you can go wherever you want on foot. If you're hungry, just go down to the street and walk 50 mts and you'll find plenty of cheap options to eat. I'd recommend to stay in this part of the city, since Sultanahmet is nice during the day, but at night is quite lonely and there's no much left to do. The room was totally renovated. it was on the 2nd floor and we weren't bothered by the street noise (there are some night clubs near the hotel). We were two people in each room and I feel it was a bit small. I suggest to take out some of the chairs or small tables so guests can have more space for their luggage. Regarding the breakfast, it was served form 7 to 10 am. Our first morning, we went down at 9:30 am and it was almost no food. Just a few slices of bread, olives and yoghurt. We saw the sausages and eggs tray empty. they never refilled them. I think they should keep refilling the buffet until breakfast closing time. The second morning, we went down at 8 am. There was plenty of options, bread, ham, cheese, cereal, eggs, sausages, etc. BUT the breakfast area was full. We had to wait 10 minutes standing with our plates on hands for a table to sit down. the bad thing was that some 4-people tables were occupied just for one or two people and the staff didn't help to reorganize people so we could all fit in. We got a table and nobody was there to clean it up. I suggest to have more staff during the breakfast for organizing the table sitting. Apart from the details during the breakfast, we had a nice stay. You can get to the top floor and make some beautiful pictures there in the closed down restaurant.
