{"Reviews": [{"Content": "Comfortable beds and Internet that works It is a little difficult to find, since it is in a large corner building housing lots of little shops. It is on the far side of the building from the busy corner. It's worth the look. The beds are especially comfortable. The in room high-speed Internet worked great. We moved from another nearby hotel where both were sorely lacking. Interesting room design. Be alert to raised floors in portions of the rooms when moving about to the bathroom in the middle of the night.", "Date": "Dec 19, 2006", "ReviewID": "UR107780585", "Ratings": {"Service": "-1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "-1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "4", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "-1", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "MinnesotaJdwc"}], "HotelInfo": {"HotelURL": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g294212-d607414-r6473752-FuramaXpress_Hotel_Beijing_Zhong_Guan_Cun-Beijing.html", "HotelID": "607414", "Price": "$76"}}
