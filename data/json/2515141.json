Because of the convention, all the hotels closest to the convention center were full and The Hampton Inn was the closest we could find on short notice. The Hotel was near the space needle and a monorail trip away from the downtown core (convention center). Keep in mind that on weekends, the monorail doesn't run until 9am.The hotel is on the major bus routes, and the buses are frequent to the city core. I arrived at The Hampton at 8:30am, exhausted after an early morning flight and our room was ready for me upon arrival. This was well appreciated! The hotel was more economical than the other chains in the downtown core, but wasn't lacking quality. Our room was squeaky clean and very comfortable. The staff members were friendly, helpful and cheerful. The breakfast was fresh and plentiful. There were 2 computers for guests' use in the lobby. The area around the hotel (Queen Ann Ave.) is very trendy and has many fabulous restaurants, a great market (with organic selections) and a wonderful cafe (top notch coffee and organic- gluten free baked goods) just across the street.

The bathroom has a dungeon-sized, very heavy and squeaky door, perfect for waking your partner in the middle of the night.

Conveniently located means that there were a number of good sounding restaurants within a block or two and two food markets within several blocks. In addition, Pacific Northwest Ballet and a couple of theaters were also within a few blocks while others have mentioned proximity to the Space Needle and that area. A couple of potential downsides. The website for the hotel mentions a $15 fee for parking, but I was not charged for parking .... perhaps because I am a Hilton Honors member? Anyway, good news. Our room had a private patio and a nice view of the Space Needle, but the door to the patio had a rather flimsy blind so that a lot of light leaked into the room at night.

Since it was a reward stay, perhaps I shouldn't be too salty, but then again, I was charged a whopping 190,000 HHonors points for a two-room suite, so I guess I'm entitled to a negative opinion of this place. Since my complaints are numerous, I will just list them bullet style. -- Location - this place is NOT downtown as it is called in the marketing of the hotel Why not call it Hampon Inn Seattle Center? It is two blocks north of the Space Needle, so I guess if you're doing that while you're in town you will have a short walk. But to get downtown you have to take the Seattle Center monorail or a cab. Poor marketing on location here, folks. -- Noise - The construction at the actual hotel may be completed, but the surrounding construction noise early Monday morning was atrocious. We were awakened EARLY by the sound of jackhammers, dump trucks, loud crashes, etc.. There is a ton of construction/destruction going on one block east and north of the hotel. Of course my room was facing this mess. Not only is it an eyesore, but when you're on a mini-vaction and you want to catch some much needed sleep, you can forget about it (at least on one side of the hotel). -- Disgusting bath tub - At first glance, the suite was impressive. Spacious, full kitchen, nice gas fireplace, good sized bathroom. Then I pulled the shower curtain back and took one look at the tub and just shook my head (see attached photo). Not only did the porcelain have a quarter sized hole in it near the rear of the tub, but as you can see the entire tub had this HUGE grey stain from where a previous tub mat had been left too long and collected mold/mildew. Instead of replacing this tub, they just leave it be for guest after guest to walk in and say, \"YUCK!\"?? That just boggles the mind. -- Heating/AC - Alright... so it's nearing winter time in Seattle. Which means, damp, cold, mid 40's for highs every day. So I was looking forward to this fireplace thing. But the fireplace is not on a thermostat at all. It's on some stupid 5 minute timer. So on consecutive cold nights while watching TV in the living room and trying to enjoy the fireplace, you have to get up every 5 minutes and wind up the stupid timer? Please. On top of that, the separate bedrooms don't seem to have temperature control. Instead, they have this goofy looking old 1970's style wall mounted heat/AC unit. I hate to break the news to the property managers here, but as a Hilton Diamond who has over 500 nights on the road in the last 5 years, your hotel is the FIRST to offer such horrendous in room air conditioning units. -- Parking - So, I will give the hotel props for waiving my $8 daily parking fee for Diamonds. But I must say this - why charge for parking at all? There isn't a big demand for parking in this area is there? It's not like you're DOWNTOWN. And the parking? What a bizarre setup. The limited outside spaces are so narrow you can forget trying to get a full sized car in them. Then with the hotel built onto a hill there are two different parking garage entrances. But get this - the garages aren't hooked together. So once you do get parked and find an elevator things get extremely confusing. Oh, and the spaces in side the garage? Even tighter than the ones outside. Absoultely ridiculous parking situation at this hotel to say the least. -- Housekeeping - can someone please explain to me why one day the maids would clean the condo thoroughly including replacing the towels and then the next day they barely touched the place and did not bother replacing the wet wash cloths or towels that were purposely left in the tub to be replaced? Mind boggling. Staff - I have no complaints about the staff at all. The girls at the front desk are all very helpful and pleasant, as are the attendants working the breakfast area. Service here is probably the only high mark I can give. Breakfast - Typical Hampton Inn breakfast. Nuked powdered egges, Nuked greasy sausage. The line for the waffle maker was a mile long both mornings we ate here. Cereals/muffins/fruit/yogurt was well stocked and fresh. If I had it to do over again, I would have just paid to stay downtown instead of wasting a huge amount of HHonors points on this disappointing stay.", "Date": "November 16, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Victoria, Canada", "Title": "\u201cGreat location for McCaw Hall\u201d", "Author": "Jumbuck06", "ReviewID": "UR120210803", "Content": "We stayed 2 nights on 30th October, 2011 as we were attending a concert at McCaw Hall.

I had a rental car and I was told to park down the street and basically the parking lot of a retail complex, upon my return I made sure I had understood the location properly to which I was told \"as long as you are in a numbered spot you are fine\" which of course would have been useful when I asked the first time. Aside from the trek down the street, the rooms were typical Hampton Inn, The internet speed was excellent, and the bed was soft with the room being clean. You can't argue with the location as the Space Needle was 10 minutes down the street; however aside from that there isn't too much around (especially in the evening) to keep you busy if you happen to check in early evening. Its not really downtown in the traditional downtown core sense of the word, but that is another story all together. The buffet breakfast was another victim of the construction blues; It was served in what I assumed was a conference room, and the seating was very limited with very little space to navigate returning to your table with a bowl of cereal. My understanding was it was a temporary location till construction was finished, however certainly worth baring in mind as there few alternatives for breakfast in the area.

In the end we used it almost exclusively to make the transfers. This Hampton is simply good and unpretentious, guests staying here being both visitors and businessmen. It is well run, and the reception desk staff could not be more helpful, including the greeter at breakfast time. It just cheered things up for all, and having the usual Hampton offering here was actually a pleasant experience. It felt good to read the paper, unrushed and sipping yet another cup of coffee.

I relocated and still, it was down. I travel 2-3 times per month and do not have issues with my laptop. I proved this 2 days later in CT by hooking up at that hotel just fine. Hampton tried to right it but after the first move, I was uninterested in moving again as I have an air-card that I can use to connect. Second, the hot breakfast on our three mornings was just OK. They took the cheap route with plain scrambled eggs, etc. Other Hamptons (See Carmel, IN review) have omelets and other foods with a little extra pizazz. Don't get me wrong, I appreciate the free breakfast. It was good - just not in the uppr tier for Hamptons. Last, I think parking there is a pain. They have a garage with a low ceiling and Thrifty gave us a small SUV. Too many cars park in the ouside SUV spots instead of in the garage where they can actually go. They should take more care in regulating this. This is especially true since they charge $12 per night to park. Being just outside of the core downtown area, I think that is pretty steep.

The major complaint about this hotel I have is that the hotel doesn't appear able to handle the large crowds that sometimes stay there. The day we checked in we waited in the packed lobby for about 20 minutes before anyone helped us. Also, if you don't get to the breakfast area early enough, you'll be hard pressed to find a spot to sit. One day when we were there we tried to use the washing machine and it was broken. We didn't find that out until after our clothes were in there, though. We made several calls to the front desk asking for someone to come look at it (there was no \"out of order\" sign or anything) and they kept promising to send someone up but no one ever came. We chalk that up to the fact that people were swarming the front desk staff with check-ins and they just forgot about it. Again, the volume of people staying at this hotel exceeds its capacity to service them well. But, for the price in that location, it's a good deal and someplace I will probably stay at next time I'm in Seattle.", "Date": "July 27, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Knoxville, TN", "Title": "\u201cWonderful for the price\u201d", "Author": "lsurrett2", "ReviewID": "UR18084382", "Content": "We stayed for a few days before our cruise.

Now, the things keeping it from a 4 star in my book: while it has a good location, it is difficult to get to.

Once you are parked, the you must get from your car to your room, which is not as easy as it sounds.

It drops you off at Westlake Center and from there you can easily access the Public Market and Waterfront. The hotel itself was clean. The layout is odd; lobby on the third floor; business center on the first. The entrance on 5th takes you to the lobby no problem, so just go in through that one. The room was clean and had standard Hampton amenities. The room was quite large and had a large safe, which was a nice plus. Service was ok.

Anyway, we were promptly offered a change of rooms, which we declined since there were free internet terminals in the breakfast/lobby area. (2) The parking garage was clean and well lit, but the parking spaces and aisles are extremely tiny. (3) The housekeeping service had some glitches on the weekend: The garbages wasn't emptied; no soap of any kind was left in the room; and the air conditioning was turned on and the window left open!

Because of road construction or trash collection, we were jarred up early with their banging and beeping when the trucks were moving in reverse. This was during the week days so if you're staying over the weekend you may not encounter this. Parking is ridiculously tight... and I agree with the other reviews in regards to this. I found parking in their garage (you use your hotel keycard to get in) was easier as most guests seemed to park outside. Everytime we parked in the garage we were able to find two spaces together that were unoccupied which made parking easier. There is a market, Quality Food Center, across the street (corner of Mercer and 5th) that was is quite nice.", "Date": "July 21, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cGreat Family Hotel\u201d", "Author": "kityhwk", "ReviewID": "UR8109198", "Content": "We just returned from our first visit to Seattle. Originally when I was planning this trip I wanted to stay more downtown. But after the trip, I am glad we stayed at this hotel. It is right down the street from the Space Needle very convenient location. I agree with other reviews that this hotels parking garage is much to be desired. The parking sports are extremely small and take some manuvering but not impossible. To make it easy on yourself, park outside if you can find a spot. The breakfast was what I would expect but changed everyday. The staff kept a constant supply coming and the hours were from 6 to 10 each morning. The food ranged from fresh fruit mix, hot and cold cereal, juices, toast, buttermilk biscuits, muffins and bagels. Each day there was a hot dish which was either scrambled eggs, waffles, sausauge patties, and sunny side up eggs. Of course there was coffee and my teens liked the hot chocolate. They also have breakfast bags to go for those in a hurry. At 3PM, there are fresh baked cookies at the front desk. They were yummy. We were on the 6th floor, the top floor. There are skylights in the hallways and in the afternoon the floor was always warm. Our room was on the street side, but there was hardly any noise. My family didn't like the beds much. They were just OK. The room was clean and they always cleaned the room very quickly. The staff was pleasant. At times, you had to wait at the front desk. They should have another person working. There are 2 computers in the lobby area. Only one that you could print from, but this was very nice. We had our laptop, but when I wanted driving directions or to print out information, it was handy that it was right near the breakfast area. The ice machine didn't work or was under construction on our floor, so I went down a floor same situation. Just had to go down to the main floor to get ice. No big deal.

At the time we stayed there had been a recent flooding due to an ice machine and there were large drying machines in the corridor and carpets had been pulled up in some rooms, luckily we were at the end of a corridor and could not hear the noise from the drying machines but did have to walk past numerous machines and around electrical cords to reach our room. Breakfast is included and there was a good selection of cereals, toast, bagels, pastries etc plus a couple of hot dishes, food was nice and you could grab a 'breakfast on the run' from the front desk if you did not have time for a sit down breakfast. location was good, couple of blocks from space needle and monorail, we walked most places however without issue, there are homeless people in most areas but not a major nuisance. our only gripe is that when we were checking out we asked the staff for the best way to get 4 of us with large bags to the airport, we spoke to several different members of staff and they all recommended the town car service at a flat rate of $35, we queried several times if car would be big enough for our luggage and were advised no problem. when the car came to pick us up he said that we wouldnt be able to fit the luggage and would get a bigger car, they appear to be based at the hotel so this only took a couple of minutes, imagine our surprise when we got to the airport and he demanded payment for $65 due to having to use a larger vehicle (a suburban), we had no choice but to pay, at no time when he swapped vehicles did he mention a difference in fee, had we known we would have looked at other options.

The Bad: Parking hell: $9 per day for their underground garage with spaces more suited for golf carts. With the cement beams every few feet, trying to park when the garage is partially full is almost impossible. Noise: Our room was on the 5th floor facing 5th Ave. Even with my trusty fan pumping out white noise, I could still hear the morning traffic. But this had to be better than camping out on the 1st floor. The tiny hallway located there is the main drag for all foot traffic heading to the elevators at the back of the motel.

Layout is very much like an apartment, very comfortable and extremely clean and quiet. Only problem experienced was slight warmth in rooms in late afternoon, couldn't get cooling system functioning easily, opening windows cooled down rooms quickly. Parking is secure and we felt safe anytime of day/night. Use your hotel card key to open the gates and park. Access from garage to rooms is convenient. Breakfast downstairs is convenient, stocked, organized and fresh. It was never too crowded, could find clean tables, or bring food back to room. Tip: bring serving tray from room to carry plates back to room for dining. Location is safe and we experienced comfortable walking distance to attractions and amenities with 3 kids and strollers. 2 blocks to 'ride the ducks' amphibian tour (well worth the trip to tour entire city by land and water), 4 blocks to space needle, 1 block to 7-11 (they even have organic milk!) / tower music store. Tip: Dining at space needle for lunch is worth the experience, it includes admission to top. Lunch has $26 minimum, but that is the price of each meal anyway. Taking separate admission cost of $14, you have a 'gourmet' lunch of $12 each with drinks, not bad. We went midweek and had to wait 40 min for seating w/o reservations, so make your reservation in advance! Wished we hadn't eaten before embarking on Pike's Place - go with an empty tummy! Lots of cafes/shops/eateries/bakeries & wine tasting. We are 'food junkies' and drove from Bay Area to Seattle.

Looks like most of the Seattle is under construction, literally.

Never stayed at a Hampton Inn before, but will certainly, highly, recommend this one to anyone staying in Seattle. Only there one night before getting on a cruise ship the following day, but we loved our stay. The staff couldn't have been any nicer to us. I did a lot of research before booking this and had read no negative comments about the place . . . now I see why. I booked this 5 months ago and got a great rate of $145 ($165 with taxes, etc.) for one of the two-bedroom suites. Had a full kitchen with dining area, 2 full bedrooms and 2 baths, a gas fireplace in the living room and a small patio off the living room. Both bathrooms were brand new and spotless, as was the kitchen. We were on the first floor so we had no partiulcar view, but going out onto the patio we could we some of the downtown skyline. Read comments about construction going on, and yes, it look lilke it still is. Must be taking them forever to put up the condo across the street, but we faced a side street (not the construction) and we were there on a Friday night and didn't hear any noise. A couple of pieces of furniture in the living room were a little worn and stained, but not horrendous, and that would be our only complaint. Far from a real complaint in my opinion for the great value and location. Someone posted somewhere that this was an iffy neighborhood. I don't know where that comes from since it's in the Queen Anne neighborhood fringe and only a few blocks from the Space Needle. Neighborhood looked just fine to me. Actually one I'd like to live in if I lived there. Well, I could go on and on, but I think you get the idea that we were very, very pleased by our choice and I think you will be too. Looking forward to going back and staying there again some day.
