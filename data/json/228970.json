(Why not use the Metro? - see below). Staff were friendly in the tradition of Fellini's comment that 'Rome welcomes you when you come and forgets you when you go'. Restaurant felt more crowded than last time but the bar staff and porters were very helpful. Stay was marred by confusion on checkout; I'd reserved two rooms under my credit card and my friend paid on his card for it to appear they were unable to cancel the original reservation so that my friend appeared to have paid under his card while both rooms appeared on my statement; two weeks later we're only just sorting out. If you're booking for someone else then get them to do their reservation. Note this wasn't a problem at the hotel in Florence we'd come from. Later in the morning my friend had his passport stolen at the Termini station one Metro stop north by a gang of young girls; please read all the warnings and use a money belt. The general attitude is that this is part of the Rome 'experience', you will not be coming back so the impetus to do something about the root problem just isn't there. Although the US embassy were efficient, the police take the view of giving you the minimum paperwork and then wanting rid of you. Hotel were helpful in letting us to use their phones to call to cancel cards etc and get a copy of the passport (as hotels take a copy of the photo on arrival); streets around the hotel are fine for evening strolling but just remember you're in a capital city and you're a potential target. La Cicala e La Formica behind the hotel and Gli Angelotti 100 metres away are both good restuarants - with the latter the winner this time.

There are 2 breakfast rooms, one of which is small & quiet which means that it's possible to enjoy breakfast in a quiet space, despite the large tour groups which stay here. Our room faced the front of the hotel & there was some traffic noise, but that's to be expected. Though it might be worth asking for a room at the rear if this is likely to bother you. The rooms are a good size & there is a hairdryer in the bathroom, though no clothes iron. It's a shame, however, that when we arrived the reception staff made no attempt to smile. The man who dealt with us (Gianni) was poring over paperwork & eventually gave us his attention to start the check in process. We paid over 200 Euro a night plus city tax, yet it felt like we were an inconvenience. Later after we'd unpacked, my other half asked about the air conditioning. The man on reception curtly replied that this does not come on until 1st May. That wasn't a problem, but again there was no smile or effort to be courteous. I paid for internet access in the room but could only get access by taking my laptop to the lobby & working there. I didn't complain about this, but just accepted it. But one morning even that wouldn't work so I asked at reception & was told (again curtly) 'there is a problem with the server'. Again - the content of the message was fine, but the attitude was defensive, bordering on surly. Luckily on the day we checked out we were dealt with by a member of staff who had a pleasant attitude so we know that not all the staff are morose &/or defensive. We are not highly demanding or rude so the attitude of staff was a little puzzling. Away from reception the other staff were pleasant. So overall this is a nice hotel.

It is totally worth it and the same employee that has been there at the breakfast entrance for years. One large block as exiting the hotel to the left is the Coliseum. The high steps right across the street lead to St Peter of the Chains church with a Michaelangelo statue and there is no fee for this. It is all just jaw dropping in its artistic beauty. The a few blocks along the main street as you exit along the main street you can arrive to the roman ruins. If you walk left along this crossing main street you will arrive to an alley where many stores and restaurants along the way lead to the Trevi Fountain. If you go further you arrive at the Spanish Steps. It is all comfortable walking distance from this HOTEL. The tour groups use the Hotel so sometimes it can be crowdy and you may feel the attention is not there but we were helped with our luggage and every question was dealt with by the staff.There is a nice restaurant as you exit the hotel to the left about a block and a half. I loved the mussels and the wine was smooth. The head waiter however chooses who enters at times. The location, the value is great. Now in MARCH there is NO AIR CONDITIONING and the room can be warm. We opened the window to the alleyway and slept okay. There is airconditioning in the lobby area. Due to previous reviews on its bar, we stayed away from that area. However it may have changed due to the reviews.Sales are going on during this time in the stores and really when you have seen 2,000 and 4,000 euro prices in Paris and then come to the great styles here and pricings it is a wonderful treat and to have this Hotel in that experience just makes for a nice trip which is what we all want. You CANNOT beat the location. In case of an overflow there is a Hotel Solis further down the street which seems to not be used much. The bathroom is small and so is the room (we were assigned 806).

The location is ideal, being right in the centre of Rome and within walking distance of the Colosseum, the Forum, the Trajan Markets, the Vittoriano and of a Metro station. Quite a few good restaurants around as well, but go a couple of streets away from the Via Cavour and its tourist traps. Lots of good gelaterias on Via Cavour, especially the one towards the end of Via Cavour, near the Largo Corrado Ricci. We were on the fourth floor, facing the back. The bed was comfortable and huuuuuge (super king size). The room was clean, tidy and turned down every night, as you'd expect. The room was functional, with enough space to move around and ample storage space. Full height mirrors as well. The breakfast was good. We booked this hotel through www.lastminute.com and decided it was preferable to pay the extra for a city centre hotel than all the ones further out in the Eur district, among others. What we saved in train and Metro tickets by being in the centre paid for the extra that the hotel cost. Rome is the sort of city that is relatively easy to get around on foot. The rate was perfectly reasonable (although I can't remember it, sorry!) and what you'd expect from a 4-star hotel. The hotel staff were courteous and helpful, helping with a couple of restaurant recommendations and with a plug adapter (mine disintegrated itself in my bag).

The bed was two twin beds put together, but they were not on rollers as some reviews have stated. Decor was good and had a modern feel to it.

Breakfast was very good, lovely eggs and bacon (boiled and scrambled eggs) on the buffet, along with cold meats, cheese, pastries, yoghurts, cereals, toast, smoothies, fruit, and good coffee (espresso) and tea (Twinings). The hotel staff were friendly/helpful, check out time is midday and there is a facility to leave bags after check out. The location of the hotel is perfect for the Colluseum/Forum/Palatine Hill as it's just a 5 minute walk away. Also access to the hotel from the airport is very good as trains/buses stop at the Termini station at the top of the via Cavour. It's a 20 minute walk from the hotel (we did this with our cases... on wheels). As for the rest of the city, well we did it all on foot. Not for everyone, but we managed it. With a bit of planning it can be done (wear comfy shoes!) Eating out is good, we found some great little places to eat close to the hotel, the best advice we received was \"look for the places that are full of Italian people\", we did this and got great food, for great prices. Also, ask about the house red wine, it'll be cheaper and doesn't often feature on the menu! Also, there are a number of gelaterias (ice cream parlours) in the local area, lovely!

BUT THERE IS SUCH A PLUS with this Hotel regarding Location. You walk one large block to the Coliseum and three blocks down to the view the Roman Ruins, The Forum which you can do at your lesiure. The Trevi fountain with the church nearby is just amazing site and the spanish steps with the coture stores are another plus all close to the hotel . The stores that are managed by Orientals are NOT necessarily the best deals anymore. We had an Italian painter signing our purchased photos in sepia and watercolor. Then there are the merchants with knockoff items at good prices and genuine leather. We looked for items actually carrying made in Italy on the item. This hotel has a shower bath with a revolving type of glass curtain which can leak. So does the hotel in Paris. This was not my favorite but the water was hot when needed. We loved the breakfast offered the eggs, bacon which tastes like Canadian bacon, juices, cheeses, meats, and their Italian coffee was plentiful. There is a grocery store on the opposite side to the left when you exit the hotel and also to the left on the side of the hotel is a nice restaurant offering GIANT MUSSLES, Bufalo cheese with tomatoe which you can drizzle with olive oil for appetizer and the smoothest wine. With all the walking, we slept very well on the light matresses.There is a Phillips tv. There is a hair dryer. The staff helped with the internet.

In the night you could hear the traffic.. anyway I was that tired every day that it didn't bother me at all. The bathroom was also old style, but also very clean.. the only thing I didn't like was the sound of the toilet flush.. quite loud, so I hope we didn't irritate our 'neighbours'. The breakfast was a nice experience too. Palatino has two breakfast rooms. One is for the large groups and the other is for the individually booked guests. As we were the individuals we loved it. The waitresses were not always smiling, but again I know how I act sometimes at work when dealing with the customers, so I fully understand :) Outside the hotel there are nice restaurants, pubs, internet cafe, grocery shop, so pretty much everything what you need.

My wife and I traveled via back pack from Finland to Itlay, hiking through the Swiss Alps and into France before we finally settled in the beautiful, but dirty city of Rome. The Palatino Grand Hotel was situated near the Colloseum and overall was a well positioned hotel in the city. Easily within walking distances to every major sight (except the Vatican) 5 minutes! As most Italians told us the time it took to get anywhere. Good luck finding the Trevi Fountain and the stupid Spanish Steps, we walked around the same spot several times, before we stumbled upon the beautiful, yet jam packed fountain. The Italian people in Rome were pretty rude to say the least, but that's because they mistook me for an Italian and thought of me as a \"sell out\" because I am not fluent in Italian, to their and my mother's dismay I am not Italian, just darker than your average Norweigan. Be prepared to bump into people often, because Rome is packed with people, learn the word \"scuzi\" and the hand gesture that resembles a \"fyou\" in America, you will need both Italian staplemates. The hotel was standard at best, it had air conditioning, the rooms were clean and the bathroom had a very sensual toy for couples only, it was amazing, cold water flowing in your nether regions, sensational idea those Italians have. The breakfast was offered as a buffet, my god was it not an American style breakfast, I ate popovers with jam and canned peaches everyday, I didn't want to touch the eggs, or the sausage that looked as if they were still clucking and snorting around on plates, at least it had bottle water. Speaking of water, the public water in Rome is actually good to drink, I drank from the Spanish Steps and at the Roman Forum, the Roman Forum was very refreshing, especially the one at the top of the hill overlooking the entire city, make sure you push your way through to the water to get a sip, because Europeans have never heard of waiting in a line like normal, civilized people, which is hard for me to say since I am European at heart. You must find IL Maggio Ristorante near the Trevi Fountain, it serves up the greatest Pollo Romano that I have ever had! We spent some serious Euro here, but well worth it, ask for Gino and you'll get free bread. A few helpful hints while traveling in Rome: do as Romans do and walk out in front of traffic at anytime, but be leary of mopeds and motorcycles. Don't take pictures with guys dressed in gladiator suits, they will charge you 5 euro per picture, or smack you around a little if you don't pay. Refuse the bread at dinner, because they will make you pay for it even if you don't ask for it. Ask the restaurant if they take credit card first before you start ordering, sometimes they don't take credit card unless it's over 40 Euro, and last but certainly not least, don't exchange your cash and use your debit card at the ATM, or credit card as much as possible, you will get a much better rate.

I knew I wanted something that was close to the Colosseum because that was one of the main attractions that I wanted to see. This hotel is a five minute walk to the Colosseum and is in a great overall location. We walked to pretty much everything from here except the Vatican but we did end up walking back From the Vatican. Believe me we walked the entire city except the area near the Spanish Steps as the last 2 days of our trip were to be spent there at a different hotel. The hotel itself was quite nice. I had booked a stand room with a double bed on the hotel website but I had put in a special request for a complimentary upgrade if possible because we were celebrating our 20 year anniversary. The hotel arranged our transport from the airport to the hotel. When we arrived our room was not ready but after waiting maybe 15 minutes the desk clerk said he was upgrading us to a Junior Suite. This was really nice. It had an amazing bathroom and the room itself was quite large with a king size bed, table and chairs, lounging sofa, tv, safe. Our room came with a breakfast daily. They had two breakfast areas. One was for tour bus patons and the other was for people who had booked on their own. The food was actually quite good and there were many selections. There were the typical deli type meats and cheeses, scrambled eggs, bacon (that was a little too limp for my taste) numerous pastries, yogurt, juices, coffee. The staff in the breakfast area were a little snobby some days but we just overlooked that and didn't have a problem. They always supplied you with whatever you requested.

Our room was obviously newly refurbished, spotlessly clean, with a large comfortable bed, crisp white linen sheets, flat screen TV mini bar & safe.

As for the room, I'll mostly leave you to the attached pictures to judge for yourself, but it was well-maintained with some upgrades like a plasma-screen TV with satellite reception, a balcony (with a view of the Roman Forum in the distance), in-room safe (large enough to hold my laptop), bathrobes, and a nice assortment of toiletries. Housekeeping was meticulous. It would be considered a solid 3-3.5-star hotel in the US. Breakfast was a fairly extensive hot/cold buffet breakfast spread: Bacon, eggs, yogurt, fruit, a variety of baked goods, Italian hams, sausages and cheeses, and more. Cappucino and espresso are available upon request, quite enough to carry you through to dinner with a mid-afternoon snack. The hotel makes a terrific sightseeing base. The main Roman ruins are just minutes away by foot and most of historic Rome is within 20-30 minutes' walk. The hotel is right next to the Cavour Metro stop. This facilitates train travel to/from the airports, as well as many areas within and outside the city that can be reached on the Metro lines. The hotel, however, is a little far afield from some of the historical center where the Metro does not run (but its certainly still walkable). The restaurant choices nearby, while competent, are limited. On the whole, the desk staff speaks passable hotel English, but don\u2019t expect an extended conversation. If you want to know how to get to specific places, they\u2019ll try to sell you a tour. Overall, a smile, and an attempt to use whatever Italian (or other Romance language) you can muster, will be warmly received and reciprocated with a patient effort to help you. (Remember, Americans, you are the foreigner here!) The hotel is popular with tour groups (and for good reason). Elevators/common areas can be crowded around group arrival/departure times. Groups eat in a separate room that we ate in one morning because the other room was full. Both had the same food selection, although the service was generally better in the smaller room. A few practical suggestions \u2013 If you don\u2019t have a lot of luggage, take the local train from the airport to Rome\u2019s Ostiense train station (only 5.5 EUR.) Transfer there, via moving walkways to the Piramide Metro station. Take the Blue Line three stops toward Termini to Cavour (1 EUR). Walk up the steps to the main street above, turn right and walk about 100 meters. You\u2019ll get there just as fast as the express train (perhaps faster since the local train tends to run more frequently), and save 5.5 EUR. Buy a day pass for 4 EUR, good for all-day riding on all public transportation. Take a Metro to a good starting point (perhaps the Spanish Steps) and then wander around, hopping on and off the Metro/Buses as you and your feet please. Be aware that there are separate entrances on o the Cavour station, depending on which direction you are traveling. Taxis become very expensive, very quickly, but they do know where they are going. You might not, even with a map. At the wine/cheese/pizza store down the street by the bank machine, tell the guy what you want to spend on a bottle of wine and trust his selection.

They failed to provide the taxi driver with this so we ended up being dumped in the right general area of Rome but Many many metres away from the address. After a further 10euro taxi ride we eventually arrived at what we thought was going to be a good establishment serving Roman food. It was small scruffy and Sardinian.

It is probably a 5-10 min walk from the hotel to the Colloseum and the Roman Forum, which is a plus with all the walking that you do in Rome! It is about 15 mins from Termini, where the train from the airport comes in, so it's an easy transfer. If you're not a keen walker, which given the way that the Romans drive is understandable, the hop on/off sightseeing bus stops directly oustide the hotel, every hour or so I think. It is a great way to see the architectural features of the buildings and take good pictures of the ruins, it stops at all the useful tourist spots you could want. On to the rooms, they are fairly standard and non descript in that general hotel way, but are very clean, as are the bathrooms. We had a room overlooking the Via Cavour, which is noisy if you open the window as you would expect from a main street in Rome, they won't drive quietly! The room had adequate air conditioning, which I thought would be a good feature for Rome in late summer. The staff on the front desk were a little grumpy, but I had the impression that most people in Rome were feeling a little grumpy that week, perhaps because it was at the end of summer and they were getting sick of tourists or something. Food- We did not eat in the hotel restaurant and chose to eat down the Via Cavour towards the coloseum, the restaurants are very good, though not all staff speak english so have that phrasebook handy! They are a little touristy but the quality is still very good. Do not eat in the restaurant right next door to the hotel, it is terrible!! I am sure that they microwaved my lasagne, which in Italy should be a crime. There is a fab pizza place on a little back street near the basilica Santa Maria Maggiore that our guidebook, one of the eyewitness jobbies, recommended, it actually had some very good restaurants in. I would also recommend the smaller restaurant in the Exedra hotel on the Piazza della Republica, the food was superb and the manager was only too happy to give us a crash course on Italian wines and recommended a wonderful barolo to compliment our brilliant food.

Staff was friendly, courteous and helpful. We were given an upgrade on arrival to an executive room on the 8th floor. The greatest asset of this hotel is its location and comfort. In my opinion, you can't find a better location to visit Rome's attractions minus the Vatican which is a little far. The coliseum and the Forum are 5 minutes walk. Pantheon, most fountains and Plazas are accessible by walk. Beds are comfortable and air conditioning is working fine. We have not been bother by any noises from the streets below nor from neighboring rooms. You also have access to a safe. There are many restaurants near the hotel. You may also find useful to know that the subway station Cavour is 4 minutes walk from the hotel (on the little street behind the hotel). From this station you have access to all of major attractions in the city. This being said, walking is the best way to get acquainted with the city's attractions if physical conditions permit to walk few hours, of course. My assessment of this hotel would have been higher with a better breakfast and free internet. You get eggs, bacon, bread cereals, yogurt and croissant, fruit salad and juices. Not extensive choice but ok to give a good start to your day. Also, I find the prices overrated compare to other hotels I have stayed on other trips (in other countries).

We were very lucky--we were given 2 rooms on the top (8th floor). Each room had its own balcony; each faced the back of the hotel, with views of the rest of the city, including St. Peter's dome and the Victor Emmanuel monument in the distance. They had just finished the renovations, so perhaps that is how we had the good luck to get these rooms. We were in room 802, which is actually a suite, and has 2 balconies. Each room (our kids were at the opposite end of the floor in room 812) was reasonably large; ours had 2 flat screen tvs; both had minibars and safes (use them!!!!!--I had my wallet stolen on a bus). The beds were incredibly comfortable, and each room comes with slippers and bathrobes. Tons of towels; 2 showers in our room (one as part of a giant bathtub); turn-down service at night (one night they seemed to forget; maybe because it was Sunday and they have fewer staff.) The hotel location is very convenient--it is about a 10-12 minute (not 5!) walk from the Colosseum, but easy. It's barely 75 yards from the nearest metro stop, which itself is only 1 stop from the Stazioni Termini. It's also barely 2 minutes up steps across the street from the church San Pietro in Vincoli--which has the Michelangelo statue of Moses inside it (no charge to enter). This is one of the most impressive statues you will ever see, in my opinion. Metro: We reached the Vatican stop (which requires transferring) in less than 20 minutes by metro from the stop near the hotel. It's an easy c. 15 minute walk to the Piazza Venezia and c. 20-25 minutes to the Trevi Fountain (go at night!). The hotel breakfast buffet was quite large and satsifying; service was a bit indifferent; you can order any version of coffee you wish (also, tea, etc.). Staff at the front desk were generally helpful to very helpful; certainly did not encounter anyone who was rude or unhelpful. They were very good about letting us leave our luggage in a secure room after arriving at c. 11 am. All in all, this one of the best hotels we have ever stayed at; if you can get a room with a view (rear, not street), it's hard to believe you will regret staying here.

Also, the neighborhood around the hotel is safe and there's a great local Roman place just behind the hotel & up from the Metro station (Suburra's) which is great food, plentiful and quite affordable and quaint. And almost right next door towards the Forum is another great little place that's only slightly more expensive. (I can't comment about the hotel restaurant as unfortunately we never had time or convenience to use it.) There's also in-lobby internet available with a credit card at 3 Euro/hour.

So, by the time we found the Hotel Palatino (thank goodness for GPS) we pulled up reassured that we would at least be able to park the car, they advertise garage space after all. But no, we were wrong, in fact the garage was full that day and they gave instructions for a garage elsewhere (again, thank goodness for GPS) that might have spaces. After much hooting and swearing, we found the garage which did have a space but for the cost of 25 euro for 24 hours - we were desperate by this time and grabbed the space. Armed with suitcases and hand luggage we trekked the 10 minutes to the hotel a little flustered but it was ok, we were on holiday after all. The reception staff seemed reasonably friendly although I got the distinct impression they were not actually that happy to see us. Our room reminded me very much of a UK Traveldoge room - certainly clean and sparse but without the luxury of tea/coffee making facilities which would be expected as standard in Travelodge. The Colliseum is certainly nearby and yes, we enjoyed our evening sightseeing - Rome was not the focal point for this trip but a starting point for my 40th birthday trip to climb Mount Vesuvius. Friday morning we awoke for breakfast and were ready to further explore Rome before leaving that afternoon. Off we headed to the breakfast room only to be met by a waiter who made us feel distinctly uncomfortable ( after thanking him for bringing a pot of tea to the table he said \"don't thank me, I am only able to feed myself and my family because of visitors to the hotel - I should thank you\".) Within seconds of this statement, as I went to collect a bread roll and jam for breakfast, he further accosted me to tell me that although he wasnt the 'big boss' only the 'little boss' would I please mind not wearing my Birkenstocks into breakfast the next day but more appropriate footwear? I was seething (did he not know how much Birkenstocks cost) and this pretentiousness and idiocy made me snarl at him that there would be no way I would be at breakfast the next morning. An Italian sitting alongside me smiled at me sympathetically as if to say he didn't mind at all if I wore my Birkenstocks to breakfast but the damage was done, we got up and packed pretty quick smart - of course, the waiter had no idea we'd left as he'd already accosted a group of French tourists by then! We headed to Sorrento which was much improved and our hotel was lovely. Neither myself nor my husband are the 'city type' and we are not pretentious at all, we are perfectly happy to accept absolutely any footwear to breakfast at 8.30am, so perhaps we were wrong to book this hotel. Regardless, I would not recommend it as we did not have a happy stay here.", "Date": "May 23, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "UK", "Title": "\u201cPerfect hotel for a long weekend\u201d", "Author": "LillieUk", "ReviewID": "UR7231665", "Content": "We booked this hotel based on reviews on tripadvisor and were not disappointed so wanted to write the reivew so others can benefit from this great find! The Palatino Grand Hotel is in the perfect loction, very safe, a 2 minute walk from the tube which is a one stop connection to the Termini Station, or a ten minute walk direct to the main Termini Station where you can get the tube to any of the attractions. It's also a couple of blocks away from the Colosseum - a very central hotel. You can pretty much walk to all the popular attractions and we only travelled by tube twice in our 4 day stay - we definately burnt off the calories consumed eating all the fabulous food Rome has to offer (the Pizza's are to die for!) The Hotel itself is a very nice 4star, the rooms are clean and well equipped, the hotel staff are very friendly and willing to help. The breakfast is fairly standard, fruit, pastries, cereal, tea, coffee, juice etc. If you get the chance try one of the coffees in the hotel bar... we finished off every day of walking and sightseeing with an Irish Coffee in the bar! If we went back to Rome I would definately stay at this hotel and would recommend it. Overall we had a brilliant 4 day break however a few tips that may make your trip easier: If flying with Alitalia make sure you eat before you travel... their plane food is the most disgsting I have ever had (and I've travelled with a lot of different airlines). I thought as Alitalia was the National Airline of Italy, I was expecting more, it's fine, and functional but nothing more than a budget airline. The second tip is be prepared to queue and do some research on what days you want to visit different attractions. The queue for the Vatican Museum on a Monday (it's worse at the weekends) was over two hours long. If your budget can stretch to it, go with a tour as you can queue jump and on the two tours that we did (Colosseum and Vatican Museum) the tour guides really knew their stuff and made the experience much more enjoyable. The third tip is try and book a taxi direct with your travel booker from the Airport to your hotel in Rome. We paid when we booked the trip and after hearing all the stories about being ripped off by the taxi drivers at the airport it was nice to have someone collect you (plus it worked out much cheaper). We also got the train back to the airport from the Termini station, it goes every half hour is very safe and clean and only costs 11 euro per person, it takes 30 minutes door to door! The last tip is for the ladies... 95% of the streets in Rome are cobbled so don't even bother taking your heels! Despite all the reviews saying that the Romas dress up to the nines, we only saw a handful of glamorous looking women and that was in the shopping district. All the tourist attractions are populated by tourists - jeans, jumpers and backpacks were the norm. Lastly, have a fab trip, Rome is amazing!", "Date": "March 27, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "3", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "New Jersey", "Title": "\u201cComfortable stay...\u201d", "Author": "NickNewJersey", "ReviewID": "UR6840946", "Content": "Hotel lived up to its expectation.

We really enjoy walking in Rome as everything is very near and very easy to get to There are lots of restaurants and cafes in surrounding area, we tried 2 of the italian restaurants and it was good. The indian restaurant right in front of the hotel is fantastic as well! served fantastic Beriani. Lots of groceries shop and souvenir shop. No need to buy souvenir elsewhere - its cheaper in this area!!! ROOM Book 3 standard classic room and we were given 3 neighbouring room with 2 connecting room which is just fantastic. We booked through the hotel website which offers fantastic price - \u00a398 per nite per room which is very good value. The room is quite big in size and there is even a round coffee table with 2 chairs for sitting and relaxing. The tv has lots of channels in italian and 3 english channels which is BBC, CNN & MTV and I think there's 1 english movie channel (haven't had time to watched it!) BREAKFAST The breakfast was included in the package and it is fantastic! There are scramble eggs, poached eggs, smoked salmon, brilliant choice of pastries, breads, cereals, fruits, juices, cheeses and the choice of any hot drinks that you want - either its cappucino or Latte! STAFF The staff there were brilliant! Very friendly, always there to help you and there is 1 staff that worth the mention - his name is Roberto. He is great! Very very nice, warmth, he's like a friend -help us around in getting to the attraction places and in letting us know which bus to take and everything. So next time you were in the hotel - find Roberto! DISLIKE The only thing that we didn't like about the hotel is the old, plain design of the classic bathroom. I think this need to change - although they have another room called 'designer room' which is very immaculate in design but I think for classic room - the bathroom need to be at least modern & new. Another thing is the noise, room facing the main road will hear some noise from the traffic outside although it will reduce towards the end of the nite.

They usually have good selection of food and reasonably price if you tired of pasta, pizza and sandwiches. Prawn and fried rice are usually pretty good. Also try the gelato down the street where they sell Illy coffee. That's one of the best gelato we have in Rome. If you going to see the Pope on Sunday noon, do hold on to your wallet. The place is packed and its full of gypsie kids who will try to get your $$. One guy in our trip caught the kid where 1 in front try to distract him and the other tried to pickpocket from behind.

The Colosseum, Forum and Palatine Hill is only about 10 minutes away. There is also a bus stop a few steps away, but not sure what bus # stops there. The rooms are kept clean with hairdryer, safe, refrigerator and usual amenities of shampoos, soaps, shoe polisher, etc, which are re-stocked daily. We had a triple bed room which was very comfortable. The hotel is however on a very busy street, so do expect traffic noise when the windows are open, especially if your room is facing the front and if you are there over a weekend. Lots of restaurants closeby (behind on the small streets). They do serve a good daily breakfast spread (scrambled eggs, bacon, sliced coldcuts, smoked salmon, croissants, danishs, bread, cereals, fruit, etc). The front desk is cordial, but I did not find them especially friendly or helpful when we inquired about specific tourist sites and asked for help in making reservations to museums. There is a grocery store (Elite) across the street and another smaller convenience store down the block where we bought water and soda for reasonable prices. However, I do suggest that you make sure what they charge you at the cash register is correct against the shelf prices. We did almost get charged double when we bought only 2 items! There is internet service available in the individual rooms, but I believe usage needs to be set-up with the front desk so that the charges can be recorded.

Our room number was 813, the 8th and top floor. We had the executive suite which was only 10 euros extra per night. Our King sized bed had comfortable, firm mattresses. We had a beautiful balcony with automatic shutters that faced via de Cavour. The shutters greatly reduced the sound from the streets. Our room and bathroom didn't feel cramped at all and was very clean. They supplied us with lots of toiletries, slippers and robes. The room also had a closet, safe, chairs and table, bathtub, and bidet. A large breakfast buffet was included every morning. The dining room was bright, clean and well decorated. Breakfast included bacon, eggs, breads, cereals, yoghurt, cold cuts, cheese, and drinks. Of course, the food is best and freshest if you don't wait until the end. Also, this menu was served everyday, so we were quite tired of it by Day 4. The staff in the dining room did not speak English, nor the maids, but anyone behind the concierge and check-in counter spoke very well. The downfalls: 1) We were fortunate that the weather was very beautiful when we were there at the end of March. It was quite warm which also made the room a little too hot for sleeping at night. I had no problems sleeping, but my husband requires cooler temperatures. With the terrace doors open to the balcony, a nice flow of air cooled down the room, BUT via de Cavour is a very, very busy and noisy street at any hour. It was impossible to sleep with the constant honking and roaring of cars, motorcycles and scooters. Plus our air conditioning unit did not work. We complained on the 2nd to last day, which was probably too late. They claimed to have looked at it while we were out, but it was not fixed. 2) A very minor thing: the shower is only meant for short people! The shower hose is attached to the bathtub nozzle. If fully extended to accommodate people over 6 feet tall (like my husband) or even 5'5 (like myself) then the hose bends and the water cannot go through. Either take a bath, or hold on to the shower head, using it like a spray. Otherwise, we were very happy with this hotel. As other people have mentioned, the location is excellent! It's about two blocks away from the Colosseum, Palantine Hill and Forums and the subway is just around the corner. We tried the subway once at 8am to get to the Vatican. It was so packed, everyone was pushing their way onto the train. I don't recommend it, at least not at that hour.

We stayed here for a week from 29 March to 05 April 2006. It could not have been more perfect. You\u2019re within a stone\u2019s throw of the Coliseum, the Forum, and Palatine Hill. You\u2019re on Cavour Street, which has every amenity you would ever need. Cavour Street is a very busy street, but the Grand Hotel Palatino offers refuge from the hustle & bustle of Rome. There is a very clean lobby and attentive staff. My wife and I arrived at 12pm expecting to be told our room wouldn\u2019t be ready (based on prior reviews). To our surprise, our room was ready and located on the 7th floor facing the rear of the hotel. (Much quieter than facing Cavour St. \u2013 make this request if possible) The room was smallish compared to U.S. standards, but who cares? All we were looking for was a comfortable room in which to sleep, shower, & change. We had comfortable beds with extra blankets if needed. The bathroom, although a bit on the small side, was just fine. We had decent water pressure with hot water all the time. As for TV, it is free, but your channel choices are limited, with the only english channel being CNN International. You\u2019re not in Rome to watch TV though!! There\u2019s a myriad of establishments on the small side streets around and especially behind the hotel. Immediately in the hotel\u2019s vicinity, you have Caf\u00e9 Borghia, which is immediately to the right as you exit the hotel. They have an extremely friendly staff and delicious food & desserts. If you exit the hotel, turn right, and then turn right again down the steps, you\u2019ll find an Irish pub on the left and the Ragna\u2019 De Oro restaurant directly in front. At the bottom of the steps, if you head left, you\u2019ll eventually come to a great restaurant called \u201cLa Vecchia Roma.\u201d (Old Rome). It\u2019s filled with locals and nobody speaks english. However, I\u2019ve never had a better plate of carbonara in my life. If you\u2019re looking for some awesome Gelato, exit the hotel, turn right and head down to via Serpenti. Make a right on Via Serpenti, cross the street and pass the church on your left. About 50 yards on your right, you\u2019ll find the cheapest Gelato place in town. Cheap does not mean tasteless either. This was by far the best Gelato we had, and we tried them all, believe me! They will give you an excellent map of Rome when you check into the hotel. This map is about as accurate as they come. It covers every street in Rome where many of the book maps do not. Fold this map up and keep it in your pocket. You can find anything with this map. Even though the hotel is a stone\u2019s throw from the Cavour Metro stop, we never used the metro, took a bus, or used a taxi. If you\u2019re able bodied, you should be walking to all the MUST SEE spots. Via Veneto (Harry\u2019s Bar, Hard Rock, U.S. Embassy) is a 20 minute walk. Trevi Fountain is a 15 minute walk. The Pantheon is a 20 minute walk. Spanish Steps are a 25 minute walk. Castel St. Angelo is 30 minutes. Vatican is 35-40 minutes. Piazza de Popolo & Piazza Navona are all within walking distance. Campo de Fiori is the outdoor market and should not be missed. You\u2019ll be amazed how much ground you can cover. Crossing the street can be a challenge, but if you use a crosswalk, keep your wits about you & take control, you can cross without being challenged. We booked this hotel through Gate One travel. We also booked a few excursions through Gate One that were booked through Carrani locally. The pick ups from the hotel were always 10-15 minutes earlier than scheduled. What they do is pick you up in a small bus, take you to the travel agency which is like the rally point and there you board a larger bus with everybody else. Recommended tours include the Illuminated Rome by Night tour (this helped us catch our bearings immediately), the Vatican Museum tour (does NOT include St. Peters, but you can use the afternoon to explore it), and the day trip to Florence (BEAUTIFUL drive and wonderful city). We also went on the Naples / Pompeii day trip with the main purpose of seeing Pompeii. This was great, but we could have done without the drive through downtown Naples. There really wasn\u2019t much to see and the traffic was horrendous. Would much rather have spent those extra two hours at Pompeii. They also stop at a Cameo factory, which didn\u2019t appeal to us at all. More wasted time at a tourist trap. If you don\u2019t book your tours ahead of time, the hotel can do it for you with a company called Green Line. If you choose to visit a site such as the Coliseum, the Forum, Palatine Hill, the Sistine Chapel, St. Peter\u2019s, or the Vatican Museums WITHOUT a guide, I highly recommend that you purchase a book by Fodor\u2019s, Frommel, or Rome\u2019s 10 Best to guide you. Otherwise, you won\u2019t have a clue what you\u2019re looking at. Believe me, there is a LOT to take absorb when you\u2019re in Rome. You cannot walk 25 feet without stumbling over something of tremendous historical significance. We never asked the hotel personnel for suggestions for anything; for fear that they would just lead us to the tourist traps. You really cannot go wrong by just venturing out on your own. Using the map that the hotel provided, along with some restaurants recommended in the \u201cRome\u2019s 10 Best\u201d book, we were able to find some delicious spots. The Imperiale restaurant at the intersection of Cavour and Imperiale (go right out of the hotel) had delicious pizza. We never had a problem feeling threatened or having that uneasy, unsafe feeling. Walk like you know where you\u2019re going, and don\u2019t look lost & confused in crowded places. You\u2019ll be fine. Suggest using a money belt or something hidden if you\u2019re going to carry lots of cash. We walked around with 100 Euros on a daily basis and a credit card. Most places accept the plastic and you get the best conversion rate by using it. Tips are included, but we always kicked in a few Euros extra and it\u2019s expected if you\u2019re American. Breakfast at the hotel was very edible. Same setup every single day: Scrambled eggs, undercooked bacon, ham, cheese, croissants, yogurts, coffee, & juice. If you ask nicely, they will make you a cappuccino. Breakfast starts at 6:30am, and unless you want slim pickings later, you should be there between 6:30-7am. The food was good enough to give you and excellent start to your day. Feel free to email me with question.

The room for the kids was nice enough (great bathroom), but then we moved to our room and you got to our bedroom via the sitting room! Combine that with the kids adjoining room and you get two bedrooms and a sitting room with couch and two chairs\u2026.luxury indeed. I\u2019d agree with the last review about the staff, or rather the reception. Yes they were very efficient but they weren\u2019t out to win the employee of the year contest. I\u2019m not sure whether it was because they didn\u2019t feel they needed to make the effort or if they just liked being downright rude. Anyway, no harm done as we didn\u2019t need to speak to them very often. Breakfast at the GHP was like all the other hotels we stayed at in Italy although I thought this was the worse with sloppy service and cold coffee, sitting at tables set for an army rather than 4 people. Location was good and some nice restaurants at the bottom of the main road. I wouldn\u2019t bother with the ones close to the hotel as they were too expensive. If you like Chinese though, or just want a cheap meal with cheap but top brand wine, try the restaurant near to the hotel; it\u2019s just down the street on the same side as the hotel. It was not the best Chinese I\u2019ve had but we finished every dish and were still alive the next day!

Having said that, we did succumb to a tout at the Coliseum but boy did that work out. For 8 EUR per adult (you had to pay 10 EUR per adult to get in anyway, but EC kids under 14 were free), we were literally pushed past the queues and were inside listening to the tour guide within 10 minutes. The tour was poor but at least we were inside! The only comment I\u2019d make about the Vatican is get there early, queue up and do it yourself. There are hand held commentary devices to be hired at 6 EUR (remember to take either a passport or driving license) which do the trick and most kids/teenagers will wilt after 30 minutes!

A great hotel situated within easy walking distance of many sites of interest. A very helpful reception and friendly staff. A nice room, but the bathroom although small was adequate. The T.V. had only CNN news, BBC news 24 and internet facilities and films by extra payment. The film start we chose was late and we had a refund. Breakfast buffet in the Dining Room was excellent and satisfied our appetites for the rest of the day. We had dinner one night in the hotel which was great and we received first class service. The hotel was situated within walking distance of many places of interest. You need comfortable shoes however as we did not know where to put our legs and feet after a day of sightseeing. At the Colosseum we were approached by a guide company - Roman Promenades, who were very much cheaper with their tours than those offered at the hotel. These were on foot however except for the Catacombs. The guides were entertaining and very informative. By taking three of their tours to the Vatican (an early start by Metro adjoining the hotel to Ottiavano), Catacombs, Circus Maximus, Marcello Theatre, etc., and night tour to Trevi Fountain, Spanish Steps and Pantheon, there was a 10 euro reduction.

There are other areas of Rome which are a bit nicer and have better restaurants within walking distance (try anywhere near Plaza Navona or the Trevi Fountain).

We were on the 8th floor and enjoyed our very own balcony (which was also spacious) which offered breathtaking views of the city - it was magical. Also, absolutely no noise. None. Finally, we had a king - yes, king sized bed. It was heaven. I did notice that this Hotel services a TON of tour groups. They were everywhere. If you get a floor with noisy partygoers, I can see this being a problem. As it was, we did not and thus, we had no issues with the big groups. The staff: not so great. Here are my beefs - the front desk people - not friendly. Helpful, yes, when asked. But not overly friendly. They did arrange a shuttle to the Rome airport for 45 Euro - which I hear is pretty good. However, I also asked at one point for a reasonably priced restauarant suggestion. The concierge happily recommended a restaurant right behind the hotel. We went. It was atrocious. It catered to stupid Americans and overcharged us for really bad food (seriously, this place would not survive in even the most deprived areas of the US). I was pretty fuming that the hotel sent us to such an obviously bad place. He told us to tell them that Nino sent us - we should have been tipped off right there that we were being hoodwinked! Next, we asked for a tour of the vatican (as I had read in various tour books that this was the only way to avoid the maddeningly long lines - NOT SO!!). They happily obliged. The tour was operated by Green Line Tours and cost us 92 Euro. It too was atrocious. The bus arrived one hour late, we did not avoid the 90 minute line (or quere). Because they were late, the tour guide rushed us through, giving us absolutely no value for our money. We were very disappointed. The lesson that we learned from all this - do not trust any suggestions or recommendations from the front desk. It is all bad and is purely designed to take advantage of stupid naive first time overseas travelers like my husband and I. Finally, the breakfast was acceptable. Unlike our hotels in Milan and Florence, we were not offered fresh coffee or cappuccinos. However, they delivered the expected spread - meat, cheeses, cereal, yogurt, pastries, eggs and bacon. The coffee on the table was acceptable - gourmet compared to American standards! So, bottom line - we might stay at Hotel Palatino again because the room was so fabulous and the location was pretty darn convenient. However, we would avoid the staff's recommendations at all costs!

Reception staff were completely customer focused with nothing being too much trouble. Checkin was a breeze despite the tailend of a travel group. A couple of problems with the room (the hairdryer hose was split and a light bulb was broken) were repaired as soon as we notified reception. The rooms were very clean, the white fluffy towels were changed every day, as was all the bed linen, and the toiletries were replenished every day as well. The full breakfast was superb - including the fresh fruit and the smoked salmon - and there was always more choice than we could work our way through.

L'Archetto - a wine bar on Via Cavour just around the lefthand bend back towards Terminii station - served absolutely excellent food (try the traditional Italian starter...wow!) but the addition of a 15% service charge on top of the per person cover charge was a step too far which sent the bill into the (entry level) expensive class. La Vecchia Roma - classic Italian trattoria/pizzeria on Via Leonina behind the hotel and left down the street - served very good food (try the gnocci with moules and the homemade pasta ...) with very drinkable table wine (both red and white) at very reasonable prices that we can only dream about in the UK!

The Grand Hotel is on a fairly busy street with a few restaurants and shops -mostly souvenir type shops. There is a metro stop within 50 yards and it is about 10 minute walk to main Termini station. The hotel is extremely convenient for the Colliseum and Forum - within 2 mins of leaving hotel, you can see the Colliseum. To get to Pantheon, Piazza Navona etc probably a 20 min walk (round the pedestrian death trap that is the Piazza Venezia!). While we were there the main entrance was being refurbished. The lobby area is fine with a large bar (largely unused as far as we could see). The hotel seemed to be popular with touring parties (American mostly) and they seemed to fill the restaurant at night. Luggage from buses also filled the lobby frequently. The hotel is traditional with no great architectural features. Our room was on the 5th floor with none of the promised panoramic views over the city as promoted in the hotel literature. The room was spacious with an average sized bathroom. Bath with shower fitting over the top. Nice soft towels. Minimal drawer space for clothes. Our safe in the wardrobe was broken. Everything was very clean. Breakfast was included in our rate. It was buffet style but you had to be out of your bed on time to ensure there was anything left! Bread rolls, croissants, juice, yoghurts, fruit, bacon, scrambled eggs were available. The dining room often got busy and tables could be at a premium. You often had to share with other people as tables sat 8. Front desk staff were helpful with directions etc. The waiting staff at breakast seemed to be non-Italians and you often had to seek out cutlery, request juice machines to be topped up.

We just got back from a great stay at the Palatino. Some of the things that were important to us probably wouldnt occur to a couple in their twenties or thirties. For instance -good fast elevators and cabs within 5 minutes. This is a must when you have arthritic knees (there are three steps up from street to lobby). Nino and Roberto behind the desk speak the best english but everyone is helpful and nice. We booked through a Gate 1 travel deal- super cheap- and got the smallest least luxurious rooms. Even so they were plenty large with couch, chair, and king bed. The long narrow bathtub had loads of pressure and hot water and that wierd Roman rounded tub bottom that means hold on for dear life when showering. The important thing is that everything was spotlessly clean all the time! Great free breakfast selections too. Cabs are reasonable but there is also a metro station behind the hotel. The area is great and all the other reviews talk about the big attractions. There are also some local attractions that should be mentioned. If you can walk a half mile, turn left out of the front door and stroll up the Via Cavor to one of the great Roman churches- Santa Maria Magiore. Enjoy the mosiacs and have a cappucino in the square and people watch. There is a taxi stand if you don't want to walk home. As you are walking, about 200ft. from the hotel Via Cavor hooks a left . Right at the hook it says Bar . Go in for great sandwiches and Gelato. 50ft. further is L'Archetto- a really nice cramped wine bar. Great food too! Try the grilled veggie antipasto. We had a teriffic dinner there. Behind the hotel to the right down a long flight of outdoor steps try Ragna D'oro. Great pizza, pasta and local wine. If you really want local turn left at the bottom of the steps and try to find La Vecchia Roma- unbelievable local color . All Romans. Point at the menu. They dont speak a word of english- great fun. Prices? Unbelievable - Antipasto Misto 4e-Bruschetta 1e-Pizza 5e-Osso bucco 10e- lamb-7e. They open at 7:30 and are turning people away by 8:00. The only other thing that we did that I would recommend for two couples is ask Roberto to book a private car for a day for 10 hours . We went to Orvietto and Assissi and got to see some unbelievable sights. 350 euros - pricey but well worth it! Palatino Hotel? We'd go back in a heartbeat.

Surely was worth the few extra euro not having to deal with the crowded buses and undergrounds. I can't say enough about how much we enjoyed our stay at this hotel.

Glad I made the right decision. I agree with what has posted previously. The hotel is centrally located, between the Colosseum and the Roman Forum. Approximately a 20 minute walk, to the Trevi Fountain, a 25 minute walk to the Spanish Steps and a 35 minute walk to Piazza Del Poplo. My husband I even walked to St. Peter's in about 45 minutes. The breakfast which is filling wanes after a couple of days, but at least it is included in the price of the room. Granted a lot of tours stay there, so it can get a little noisy in the middle of the night, with kids going from room to room. The front desk was very helpful, especially Alessandro, who was very accomodating. Also Luigi, the driver, who picked us up and took us back to the the airport. Prices comparable to taxis. It was a very good feeling seeing someone holding my name, after travelling for 20 hours. Can highly recommend 3 places to eat. One is Angelos, located at 75 Via Gioberti. Food very good and reasonably priced. Daniel, the waiter, is very fun and made the 2 evenings we ate there fun and memorable. Dinner each time we ate there was never more than 35 Euros, including a wine from the wine list, the first night. The second place is, Pizzeria DaBaffeto, located at 114 Governo Veccho, off Piazza Navona. Arguably, the best pizza I have ever eaten. Dinner for two, included, one salad, one order of bruschetta, one large pizza, one medium pizza,(we thought a large would be enough, silly us) one litre of house wine, and the meal came to 21Euros. The third place we went to, for our wdding anniversary, L'Eau Vive, a french restaurant, located at 85 Via Monterone, off Via Corso Emmanuel II, at Largo Aregentina, is a bit pricey, has to be the best french food, I have eaten outside of Paris. The restaurant is run by an order of nuns, and at about 9:30pm, they nuns handed out cards to the dinners and everyone sang \"Ava Maria\". Truly beautiful moment. Dinner came to 73Euros. It included, one bottle of water, a bottle of wine, a salad, soup, an order of escagot, 2 entrees, espresso and 2 dessets. Rome is wonderful.
