Situated in a grand old building with a lovely huge old fashion staircase, each room had a different teem and was painted by various local Artists. I had a single room on the 3rd floor which was reasonably priced and comfortable and I didn't even mind the fact that the hotel didn't have a lift. The staff were ever so friendly and attentive but are the same time casual enough as not to be over bearing. Entering the reception gave you a good idea of what was in store in this hotel. This was a fun arty hotel that didn't take itself too seriously. I was certainly happy with my choice. The room itself was beautiful! Devoid of any unnecessary clutter like a mini bar or a 42 inch LCD flat screen TV because all I wanted is a bed, a clean bathroom and free Internet.

Listen to me carefully: this place is LOUD. Like, unbelievably loud. It is right beside a train station. In the first room we saw, it was so loud we couldn't hear each other. No human being can sleep with such a din. However - when we asked to move to a quieter room, the staff was VERY helpful and found us a room in a quiet(er) corner. So we had a happy ending. The best thing about this place - you can get breakfast next door for 8 euros, and it is completely worth it - it was probably the best breakfast we had in all of Germany. One more thing - no elevator, so I hope you like climbing stairs.", "Date": "July 27, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "2.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "scotland", "Title": "\u201cThis could be the answer for your trip to Berlin\u201d", "Author": "odyssea", "ReviewID": "UR5314690", "Content": "Have just spent four days in one of the small single rooms on the top floor with en suite facilities which are offered to budget travellers or `visiting artists'. On the plus side, the rooms were immaculately clean with an exceptionally comfortable bed. Mine was a `themed' room too which surprised me as I thought that these artistic flourishes only extended to the pricier accommodation. The reception staff were pleasant and helpful with the exception of one member of staff who struggled with English and did not know the price of breakfast. (Sounds petty? Thank goodness I wasn't a hotel inspector) The hotel itself enjoys a first-rate location just minutes away from Unter den Linden, the Reichstag and the Brandenburg Gate. And it's beautiful to look at. On the minus side... There is no way round this. The hotel is next to a high speed railway line. Some of the rooms are just metres away. Mine wasn't - but the noise was thunderous at times - as if the train was heading straight for the room! Anyone who has stayed here will know I am not exaggerating! This is scarcely the hotel's fault but I would advise anyone who's sensitive to noise to steer well clear. The budget quarter where I stayed is VERY spartan - those who value home comforts can forget it. It's hostel standard and if that's what you want, great. Otherwise, look elsewhere! There are no facilities like a bar in the hotel itself -just a drinks machine. In fairness there is a restaurant next door - Weinguy- which seems to have struck a deal with the hotel and serves breakfast to guests. It's NOT included in the price of the room and will cost you eight euros. Having said that it was worth the money and the surroundings were lovely. I got some very good feedback about their business lunch and evening meals. Because I wasn't staying in the customised rooms designed by artists, I don't know if I am that great a spokesperson for this hotel. I would however be interested to hear what you tripadvisor members have to say about this pricier part of the tariff", "Date": "June 6, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "5.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Orlando", "Title": "\u201cStay here!\u201d", "Author": "xxxooo", "ReviewID": "UR4582746", "Content": "This past December we stayed twice at the Hotel Kunstler Luise in Berlin, having stayed there once before four years ago. They offer a variety of accomodations, from singles to suites, and every room is decorated differently by local artists. We spent five days there, through New Years Eve, before going to Dresden, and stayed there again on our return. All of the front desk staff speaks english, and are extremely cordial. They allowed me to use the internet system located at the front desk for checking email, flight information, etc. As long as you're not greedy with time, there's no charge. The location provides easy access to the subway system, as well as a good selection of nearby restaurants. Each room has a unique artistic flavor, and the beds are quite comfortable. In fact, you can see images of the rooms on their website and request specific artists. A good buffet breakfast, consisting of breads, eggs, bacon, fruit, yogurt, etc., can be had in the restaurant next door (8 euros). I would highly recommend this hotel to anyone as it's both charming and affordable.", "Date": "March 4, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "5.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Boston, MA", "Title": "\u201cVery unusual\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR1076722", "Content": "We loved this hotel on two different stays in 2003, but it is not for everyone.

It had arrived that morning from Amazon. We were pleased to find that we were able to book two rooms on the 3rd floor without difficulty, although to get the configuration we required we could not get either with ensuite WC or shower. This didn't matter nearly as much as we anticipated as we seemed to be the only guests on the floor, certainly the only ones using the large shared bathroom. The place was warm, very well fitted out, almost completely free of smoke (possibly these were explicitly non-smoking rooms) and very interesting. Apart from a couple of bulbs that had blown the room was free of all defects. The stairs are a bit of a climb but this was probably a good thing considering the number of gut-busting meals we ate in Berlin over the tree days. Breakfast at WeinGuy next door was excellent with extremely friendly and efficient service. The croissants were the best I've tasted anywhere in Europe and certainly better than anything available in the UK.
