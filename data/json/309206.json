{"Reviews": [{"Content": "Beautiful spot, minimalist hotel A lovely and memorable building, elaborate stonework overlooking fields right in the middle of Ubud. Quiet and rural, lovely staff, very convenient to cafes, restaurants and shopping. No A/C -- just fans -- big bathrooms, no hot water heater in room, no TV, very nice pool, mountain bike rentals. The promised wifi in the room never really worked, but there are several cafes (including Kafe and the Ja Juice bar, recommended) that have it for free. The staff brings you breakfast on a veranda in the mornings and gently offers tickets to local traditional performances, which were money well spent.", "Date": "Nov 1, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR522965205", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "1", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "newyorkmeg"}, {"Content": "Disappointed in Lonely Planet review Read a glowing report in Lonely Planet,however, after arrival, a big disappointment. Rooms are dark, poor lighting. Breakfast was OK. When leaving, the room boy kept waiting for a tip (would have given him one if he acted differently. Pool not nearby. No email as stated.

The A suite, with enormous balcony and view on the pool, was clean, pleasant and spacious with traditional (suggestive) decorations.Bathroom huge and clean, but quite old and unpractical. Bathtub and toilet on elevations. Could be rather tricky for elderly guests. Shower had hot water, but water pressure was low. Staff was very friendly, but we feel improvement is needed regarding security and crisis coordination.Cleaners left master keys in our door. Another time we found set of keys on stairs to our room. That\u9225\u6a9a why we carried our valuables on us whenever we went out. Unfortunately we got robbed in the area of Petulu and lost a passport, plane ticket, money and bankcards.On the day of the robbery hotel staff was swift and helpful. Came to meet us at the police station and drove us to the hospital, free of charge. Later on things got a bit sloppy and unpleasant:To show our gratitude to Okawati we used their taxi service.To our disappointment they overcharged us for taking us to the Dutch consulate and a travel agency in Denpasar where we had to apply for a new passport and plane ticket.The morning after the robbery the driver arrived 30 minutes late (we booked him for 6:00 AM to avoid traffic to the consulate) and charged us 200.000 Rp. Much more than the taxi\u9225\u6a9a on Monkey Forest road offered. For our last ride to the airport we got charged 200.000 Rp again. It should have been less than 100.000 Rp, but we were just too shaken up to bargain.Day after the robbery somebody phoned Okawati claiming he found the stolen passport and plane ticket. The receptionist said the finder would bring them over to the hotel in the afternoon. The man never showed up\u9225? Nobody had written down the finder\u9225\u6a9a name, number or address!Staff convinced us to buy dinner at Okawati\u9225\u6a9a restaurant to wait there for the finder to come.We waited anxiously till midnight and discovered the night receptionist wasn\u9225\u6a9b informed about the robbery.A logbook at the reception desk would have been handy. The fact that receptionists were frequently absent wasn\u9225\u6a9b reassuring either. We picked up the phone at the reception desk ourselves on several occasions, expecting calls from consulate and police.Back in our home country we heard that our parents (who contacted the Dutch embassy for us) had phoned the hotel and were told we were out. Okawati staff never mentioned that phone call to us! The next day the finder phoned the hotel again and asked for a reward for returning the passport. The receptionist on duty this time wasn\u9225\u6a9b aware of the previous events either. He came to our room saying that our problems were solved because somebody found the passport. He wanted to know how much we were willing to offer as reward money as to arrange a visit by the finder.This time we lost our patience and asked to see the owner Okawati herself. Turned out she wasn\u9225\u6a9b informed either! That we already had been waiting an afternoon and a night for the finder to show up was news to her.We wanted to get the police involved now, because we doubted that the hotel staff would manage to get the finder over to the hotel.The demand for a reward seemed like blackmail to us. However, Okawati and staff seemed not to understand our agitation and asked us not to get the police involved.We felt like none of them realized the importance of getting the passport back. Our flight was only a few days later. After being told that the passport was found, we\u9225\u6a87 put the application for a new travel document on hold. We needed to know fast if we should continue the application or not.Eventually the finder came with the passport. The plane ticket remained missing.We would not stay in Okawati again because of the bad memories regarding the robbery.It still is a nice and charming old hotel though. If you manage not to get robbed on Bali, you can enjoy a very pleasant stay there.", "Date": "Feb 19, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR965865722", "Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "2", "Overall": "3", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "Willow080"}, {"Content": "Nice budget hideaway The deluxe rooms in this hotel were quite nice, surrounded in very nice gardens with friendly staff members. The rooms are quite large with four post beds and stone carvings decorating the walls, although the bathrooms are old (but not dirty). Breakfast is delivered to your little porch and tea is delivered in a thermos upon your arrival. Be sure to request a room close to the pool, because there is a block of rooms further away where we were a little uncomfortable with security. Also, be aware that there is only a safe at reception, although we had no issues when we kept our passports there. Parking is on the major street so that there is a walk down a small path to reach the hotel, which can be difficult with luggage, but staff are happy to help you move it. There is no air conditioning, but there are fans. Nothing would deter me from staying here again, although we found out later that there are some nice hotels with serene spa surroundings in Ubud for similar pricing. Continue to support Bali through their political issues! It's a destination well worth a visit. Handicrafts and art in Ubud is superior to that in other areas of Bali, and can be shipped easily.", "Date": "Oct 4, 2005", "ReviewID": "UR470500174", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "3", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member"}, {"Content": "Prix trop \u8305lev\u8305s, ben\u8305ficie d'une rente gr\u8292ce au LonelyPlanet   showReview(20238896, 'full');", "Date": "Sep 21, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR180817937", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "3", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "alouettes75"}], "HotelInfo": {"HotelURL": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g297701-d309206-r21451052-Okawati_Hotel-Ubud_Bali.html", "HotelID": "309206", "Price": "$57"}}
