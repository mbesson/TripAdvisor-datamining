The lobby is very nice looking and clean. Our room was clean and tiny, but I guess you can't expect much larger when you are working with a small budget. The full/queen bed (I'm not sure which size) took up most of the room, with just enough space around the perimeter to fit a suitcase. Bathroom is also very small and shower is not separate, but I have noticed this is somewhat common in SE Asia. I liked the blackout curtains too, which completely blocked out daylight and helped me sleep well. There did seem to be a small ant problem as I found a few on the walls and in our bed. Free WiFi was a bonus. The location is not great if you want to use the MRT as it is a bit of a walk (for the heat) but I think there is a bus that you could take to the MRT station too. The neighborhood felt relatively safe and quiet at night, and there was a convenience store nearby if you needed water or food. The Whampoa Markan hawker center is very close by and has a great selection of dishes. I would recommend this hotel for people on a tight budget who don't mind being a little far away from the main public transport system.", "Date": "April 7, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia", "Title": "\u201cgood\u201d", "Author": "Azzurro_85", "ReviewID": "UR124280532", "Content": "Stay in twin room for 2 nights.

The staff is nice. The Internet works well, and was included in the price of the hotel. The hotel decor is modern and very nice. The room I had was nice and clean.

I stayed at the Hotel Value Nice for four nights in August 2011 and found it a satisfactory base for exploring Singapore, even though it is some distance from the centre. It is easy, however, to get there by 'bus (around 20 minutes to Raffles Hotel). The nearest MRT Station, Novena, is 5 minutes away by 'bus, going in the opposite direction. You should be aware that there are no fewer than three branches of the Hotel Value chain in Balestier Road. I was dropped off at the wrong one by a taxi driver, something that happens quite regularly, I understand. The cost of hotel accommodation in Singapore is on a par with London - and is perhaps even higher. I thought that this hotel offered pretty good value for money. There is no breakfast room, but the rooms are equipped with a small kettle and a couple of mugs, as well as complimentary bottles of water. There are also sachets of coffee and tea - but pre-sugared (yuk!). There is, unfortunately, no minibar - not that there would be room for one! There is a small convenience store right next door to the hotel, and two diagonally opposite it, so I was able to buy basic breakfast items there. The choice of cafes and restaurants in the immediate vicinity is rather poor, I thought. The area close to Novena MRT Station has a much better variety. I was glad that I had paid a little extra for a superior room, with an external window. Cheaper rooms don't have one, which must make them very claustrophobic. My room was quiet and I slept very well. There was a huge mirror behind the bed, which made the room seem much larger than it actually was. The furniture and decor were in very good condition. Almost the entire space was taken up by the bed. There was no point in unpacking, as there was nowhere to store or place items, apart from four hooks on the wall. The en-suite bathroom was tiny, but perfectly OK. There was plenty of hot water at all times, though the shower was an 'open' one, which meant that you needed to do things in the correct order. The floor, however, dried pretty quickly. Free wi-fi Internet access was included in the price. I found the staff pleasant and helpful. The reception desk is so high that you can only see the tops of their heads when you pass by! The appearance of the public areas is smart and the lift is huge for the size of hotel. Would I stay at the Hotel Value Nice again? I probably would, as I don't think there are many places in Singapore offering better value for money. I paid just under 340 USD for a four night stay, which may seem a lot for a two star hotel, but believe me, it's not much by Singapore standards. Balestier Road is hardly glamorous (most of the shops lining it seem to sell furniture or lighting), but it seemed safe to me - and, as I mentioned earlier, public transport links to the centre are good and fast.", "Date": "August 26, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cBudget Hotel with a comfy touch\u201d", "Author": "Cal_TheHotelLover", "ReviewID": "UR116377100", "Content": "When it comes to budget hotel, my biggest worried is - crappy bed, dirty room, and cockroaches!

You can get local delicacy around the area and convenient store just steps away from Hotel. They could have better staff though.

Bathroom very small, but has toilet, shower and sink. No separate soap or hair shampoo, but gel containers on the wall. A word of advise, toilet first before showering, as the shower water will make the bathroom and toilet very wet (no separate shower cubicle) Comfortable double bed. No outside noise polution for our 5th floor room, but we did hear passageway noise from loud selfish guests. The hotel is away from the main tourist areas of Singapore, perhaps 20 minutes by taxi from the airport and 10 minutes from the shopping areas, but buses and taxis easy to get outside the hotel and inexpensive. Be careful when giving instructions to taxis to take you to this hotel as there are two Value Hotels in Balestier Road and a distance apart, we alighted at the wrong hotel and confusion ranged whilst we sorted things out. If you trying to avoid the ridiculous hotel prices of Singapore hotels and looking for a comfortable short stay hotel at reasonable cost, the Value Hotel Nice will be fine.

The hotel is very clean, good interior design, and very modern. the room is very small and the toilet is just the size of a cupboard :P They have live world cup matches broadcasted in every room (you need to pay / go to the pub to watch football in Singapore). consider the scarcity of land in Singapore, the room size is still acceptable (if you want a bigger room means you need to pay extra, which defeats the purpose of staying in budget hotel!!) internet is a bit expensive though. 4SGD for 1/2 an hour OR 10SGD per day if I'm not mistaken. location-wise, not so good. you need to take a bus to the nearest MRT i.e. Novena (red line) / boon keng (purple line) or take a \"super packed\" direct bus to Orchard Rd.", "Date": "July 5, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Auckland Central, New Zealand", "Title": "\u201cSmall but adequate\u201d", "Author": "parsley72", "ReviewID": "UR62704999", "Content": "We had the misfortune to travel to Singapore during Eyjafjallaj\u00f6kull's recent activity, so every hotel was full of travellers waiting to return to Europe. At the last minute I managed to get rooms here but we weren't sure what to expect. The hotel is new and very clean, and the staff were polite and helpful. The rooms were tiny; very little space round the edge of the bed, and the bathroom was also the shower cubicle. But for a place to crash after business it was fine, and better than sleeping on the office floor! There's no breakfast and didn't seem to be many places in the area to eat.

No forms to fill in for a change, the pleasant young man just wanted to see our passports and the hotel booking confirmation (we booked through Booking.com). We only booked the room for one night, we just wanted somewhere clean to sleep for a few hours before being able to check in to our other hotel. The room was small, with an even smaller bathroom, but was spotlessly clean, and the usual things in the bathroom were provided, this was a surprise for a budget hotel, but there was soap, shampoo and toothbrushes. Nice clean towels. The room had a queen size bed, a small cupboard, and flat screen tv on the wall. Our only complaint (although we didn't complain to the hotel staff, no point as it was only for a few hours to rest after our flight) was that our room was at the front of the hotel, directly onto Balestier Road, which is BUSY AND NOISY!!!! So make sure to ask for a room which does not front onto this road. There is no onsite restaurant for breakfast, although there was some kind of shop next door which sold chicken (I think), but 50 metres along to the right, there is an open cafe-style hawker's place which does kaya breakfast, it was delicious! A good choice for us, affordable, clean and nice staff. Considering the average cost of Singapore hotels, this was good value.", "Date": "November 1, 2009"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Value Hotel Nice", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g294265-d1511521-Reviews-Value_Hotel_Nice-Singapore.html", "Price": "$79 - $112*", "Address": "<address><span rel=\"v:address\"><span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">302 Balestier Road</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:locality\">Singapore</span> <span property=\"v:postal-code\">329738</span></span>, <span class=\"country-name\" property=\"v:country-name\">Singapore</span> </span></span></address>", "HotelID": "1511521", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/ProviderThumbnails/dirs/23/82/2382ec8602258a00ae3cd3a7793bbf8b1large.jpg"}}
