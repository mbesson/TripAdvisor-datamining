I would give top marks for value - 50 euros for a double, five minutes' walk from Sants Estacio (as long you take the right exit out the of the station). That's ideal for getting to the airport, and catching trains to France. Rooms are very modern, very clean, with all mod cons. But on the small side. On the downside - WiFi wasn't working during my stay there. But there are computers in the lobby, so that didn't cause too much inconvenience. The staff were OK - polite, reasonably friendly, reasonably helpful, nothing out of the ordinary. If you're looking for a late-night bite to eat near the hotel, you might come across a bar a couple of doors down in the direction of the station, called Xacobeo - avoid it like the plague. I ate meat there that turned out to be rotten, and was sick for three days. I would have reported them to the police but didn't have the time or energy. When I wanted to extend my stay, I found that the prices on Booking.com were significantly lower than the prices quoted at the reception.

The hotel then arrange to have take-away delivered which didnt arrive until almost midnight. No heating in rooms ment that I slept with the supplied bedding (cotton sheets with 1 light fleece blanket) but also had to add a second blanket I had packed to use during my flight.

We didn't eat in the hotel. We had breakfast at a couple of the local cafes, Panet and Pan & co. We had an evening meal at Martelo close by. We also ate at Quince Nits and Rossinis just off Las Ramblas. The first restaurant was good value but you have to queue to get in. Rossinis was a lot more expensive but the food and the setting was excellent. We also found if you try and speak a few words in Spanish it was appriecated by the locals. We got the train from the airport to Barcelo Sants which took about 20 mins and was then a 10 min walk to the hotel. The Sants metro station was a few minutes walk. We used T10 cards which were about 7 euros and could be shared. It took about 10 mins to get to Las Ramblas We went to a match at The Nou Camp,which was about 10 mins on the metro.

A taxi should be about 15-17 Euros, but watch out for dodgy drivers who will try and say 20 Euros before they even set off. There's a supermarket 5 minutes walk up the hill which is good for most things. The pool and pool area is quite small and is quite hard to find as it was obviously an afterthought when they built the hotel, although it was always quiet when we were there. The rooms were okay, but could do with a good dusting in some of the corners.

I'd recommend getting the T-10 travelcard for getting around, it's really good value for money. Food-wise there was a nice bakery on the road across from the metro. Worth grabbing your breakfast there. And there was a nice restaurant called Casa Martelo a bit further down from the metro - very good value. And really watch out for pickpockets. I was in Park Guell walking under some trees and suddenly I had a bird poo on me, or so I thought.

When we are visiting a place, we are not using the room much anyway. However, this hotel was a real disappointment. Except for the price, very reasonable for Barcelona, and its proximity to Barcelona-Sants, the train station (as we were travelling through Spain via train) I have nothing good to say about it. The room looked depressing, dark in colours, with very little light, stained, and ruined wallpaper, various rust-stains in the bathroom, plus a strange humid smell when we got in. The breakfast was mediocre, compared with other 4* hotels we stayed in Spain. The selection seems to be the same everywhere (probably some Spanish standard), but somehow in this hotel it looked worse than in others. Speaking of 4*, I can\u2019t see how this hotel is rated that high. As for its location (quite close to a prison btw, another depressing sight when passing by coming from one of the two subway stations serving the hotel), you pretty much depend on the subway to get to the main attractions. Connections are good and the trains run late in the night, therefore the location it not much of a problem for seeing the wonderful city of Barcelona.

This stop saved us from walking over to the main Sants Train station to get metro. We arrived at the train station coming in from the aeroport and took a taxi to our hotel which cost just over 8 euros for 2 but we later discovered it was only just over a 5 min walk if we had been sure of the directions. The hotel staff were excellent. Helpful and friendly which means a lot when it is hard to communicate as not many speak English. The rooms were very adequate although not many lights and the breakfast was excellent. Being in a quieter area not many resturants nearby but we found it no problem to take the metro into city centre when looking for more choice to eat. Resturant in hotel for evening 3 course meal looked really good but more than what we were looking for to eat.. I would recomment this hotel for freindly and helpful staff , quiet area and convenient to centre etc. We booked this hotel through hotelconnect and got a very good offer.
