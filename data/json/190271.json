The price was about average for the area, I mainly chose it because they have a 1 night minimum which is kind of rare in Napa. Here are some things that I really liked about the hotel: - Our room, obviously - The wine and cheese reception held from 6-7 is a nice touch. They serve Hall wine and have a really good selection of cheese - Although it was raining and we didn't use it, the hot tub looked amazing Here are some things that I think could use improvement: - I didn't think the staff were very friendly, particularly the woman at breakfast - The lighting on the property at night needs improvement. We nearly fell going both up and down the stairs in complete darkness, and the road was barely visible driving to/from the parking lot. - Breakfast was just ok.

This place is truly unique with it's older buildings and beautiful landscaping and sits among some grape fields. Certainly not one of your cookie cutter chain hotels which is exactly why we chose it. The leaves were just beginning to change and the place was very pretty overall. While the grounds may be 4 star, unfortunately, the place overall is not. Don't get me wrong, it's nice, I just can't give it 4 stars based on the landscaping. The room itself was about a three. It was a large room but we had purchased a higher end room so that was to be expected. We had a semi private balcony that was pleasant in the afternoons. The bed and sheets were good quality, but the little things were a bit off. The nightstand, tables, and cabinets were pretty cheap overall and many of the drawers had good sized gaps where the bottoms did not completely fit the drawer -- making them mostly useless for their purpose. Furnishings were a bit sparse also given how large the room was. The bathroom bathtub was a unique mosaic tile tub unlike anything I'd experienced before, but it had cracks in the grout that needed work. Same thing on the crown molding ... cracks everywhere. I understand we're in California and with the earthquakes I don't expect it to be perfect, but there were just a lot of these little things. We did sample the DVD collection while there and it was a nice distraction to have. Don't expect a top tier selection though as most of the movies were pretty old, but they didn't charge anything to use them so you get what you pay for. The biggest negative overall was the physical location however. You are right along the highway that is the main drag north through town. Traffic noises wafted to your ear pretty much all day and night. They do have a couple of fountains that when running help create some white noise to minimize this, but it still wasn't quite enough. In addition, the fountains were turned off at night so when it should have been the most peaceful, the street noise was even worse. Overall, we did like this place and again it was definitely a nicer experience than a cookie cutter place, but 3 stars is really the most we can give it.", "Date": "November 21, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Edinburgh, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cQuality In The Sun\u201d", "Author": "Ian M", "ReviewID": "UR120266206", "Content": "Sunshine and first class service in Napa, and only an hour and a bit north of San Francisco.

If you took a day off from touring, this would be a nice respite. We did use the hot tob and this was great! We found the wine hour was a great time to use the hot tub. All the other guests were there and we got the tub to ourselves after a day of touring. - Nice evening wine reception with plenty of tasty treats. - Nice breakfasts with fruit salad, pastries and your choice of 2 main dishes. A nice way to start your day of touring. Although, each day we were there, both choices were a form of eggs. It would be nice to have another option. - All of the staff were very friendly and accommodating. Dislikes: - Our room was in the Mansion house. While it was quaint, comfortable and clean, I wouldn't say it was \"luxurious\" by any means. The decor, furnishings and linens were nothing special. At this price point, I expected a luxury spa and we got a country inn. I'm sure other rooms were nicer, but they came way over our budget. - Noise: Our room was on the first level and unfortunately both right within the main door and at the bottom of a staircase, making for some foot-traffic noise. There is also the noise from the highway out front. Furthermore, there were chairs on the front porch outside our windows and other guests would occassionally sit there and chat. No fault of the Inn, just oblivious tourists who can't think beyond themselves. We were only there 2 nights, but I would have requested a room change if staying longer. - The hot water took a while to heat up, but when it finally kicked in, it was scalding. We also didn't like that our room had the sink located in the bedroom area, outside of the bathroom. I would stay here again if I somehow got a special rate, but otherwise would save the money and spend it on a nice dinner or other aspects of the trip.

VERY high quality! The a/c worked perfect and bathroom was normal size. Room and bathroom very clean with excellent soaps/lotion/shampoo/conditioner. The only downside of the room was the hot water. It took 10 minutes for sink water to heat up and 10-15 for shower water. After 5 minutes in shower, my husband lost all hot water. His shower wasn't immediately after mine.....it had been about 30 minutes. The pool looked nice, but it wasn't heated and mid-May isn't that warm in Napa...so no swimming for us. I was going to go in the spa....but it felt only about 90-95 degrees and this was at 6pm. I felt it again about 9pm after I mentioned to hotel staff, but it hadn't changed. Such as shame, as spa is beautiful...as is area around it....too bad they can't heat it a little hotter so guests will want to use and enjoy. The breakfast area is nice and we loved coffee, fruit, pastries and service. We were confused about menu - there were just two items (a berry French Toast and a hash/egg/potatoe plate). We didn't realize you didn't have to pick these and could order what you want. It didn't say this clearly. The French Toast wasn't tasty (sort of a strange combo of wheat bread, cinnamon and berry syrup....wasn't good) and the hash patty deal was way too done, eggs not prepared as ordered...but potatoes were excellent. I probably would not recommend this hotel if you have any physical limitations. The Historic Mansion we stayed at has no elevator and carrying stuff up 2 flights of stairs wasn't a good time. The front desk clerk made no mention of a bellman....but later that night we saw a bellman or front desk staff guy carrying someone else's bags from their car and up the stairs. Wish he was around or that front desk staff person mentioned we could ask for assistance, when we checked in at 4pm.

We were able to get a great rate through Expedia (better than a lot of crappy properties, and better than the nearby Marriott) for La Residence. I was particularly excited as I've heard great things about it. We ended up in Napa early for our full day of tastings. On a whim, we called La Residence to see if they could accommodate an early check in (thinking this would never happen), and they were able to get us in before 10 AM. WOW. Particularly for Napa - wow, and with a smile. The room was lovely, but a bit smallish. You're not allowed to use the fire place in May (not that we wanted to, but it's a romantic notion, isn't it?), FYI. The bed is very comfortable bed and has nice high threadcount linens. Our bathroom was small (shower only in our room) and had nice smelling Molton Brown toiletries. Antique or antique looking furnishings added a nice vibe. The TV was a small flat screen, but the hotel does not offer on-demand movies. They did, however, have a small selection of movies to check out at the front desk. The breakfast room is nice, but nothing special. They have an area for serve yourself coffee, tea, juice and pastries. You choose a table, and then the server will come take your order (choice of one of the two hot entrees of the day - changing daily, and fruit). The property is owned by the same folks who own Hall Winery on 29, and they offer a daily afternoon wine tasting which you can sample their wines. We never made it due to the timing - we were either hitting the last open wineries or heading off to earlier dinner reservations.

We were met at reception by Edric, who quickly carried out the required check-in formalities and arranged for us to be shown to our room.

There are a number of seating areas scattered around the property, allowing you to take in the gardens and the small number of vines growing in the grounds of the hotel. Our room was pink. Now pink is not something we would normally find a pleasant environment, however it worked. The room was a good size, with an incredibly comfortable bed. The proportions of the bedroom and the bathroom were perfect. Not too big, and not too small.... Just right! During our two night stay, we had the breakfast included each morning, and I have to say it was excellent. Scrambled Egg with pesto shrimp was just what the doctor ordered, and the next morning was just as nice, although I am struggling to remember exactly what was served. We also took full advantage of the evening wine tasting. This hotel is owned by Hall Wines, and each evening a selection of their wines are available for tasting, accompanied with a selection of hor'dourves. This is a great time to meet some of your fellow travelers, and share experiences of wineries visited in the Napa Valley. Previous posts have mentioned the traffic noise.

Plus it goes till 10 so you don't have to get up too early if you don't want to. The room was clean & you got a free bottle of wine. Bed was comfy, towels & robes were fluffy.
