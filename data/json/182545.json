The only thing that was a little disturbing was the metal Orkin pest control box that was on the floor beside the pancake maker. Possibly a mouse issue but living on the coast, we are used to that.

The staff were extremely helpful and when we asked if we could have a frig and microwave brought up to the room, it was delivered within the hour. The onsite laundry was extremely clean and well kept and breakfast in the morning was a great way to start your day off. The Press Box Pub next door was a great spot for a quick bite to eat in the evenings. The staff were helpful in getting us cabs and letting us know of the different options for transit. What we appreciated most was on the day we were coming back we had been informed that the shuttle ran to the airport at 8:00am or 10:00am unfortunately our plane had been delayed so that neither of these times really worked for us. We were pleasantly surprised when the driver informed us that he could take us out at 9:00am instead if that worked for us.

Front staff are helpful although they can be a little hit-and-miss.

Rooms are your typical modern standard room: beds are fine, layout is the same as everywhere (bed, desk, flatscreen tv, etc.). Hotel shuttle service is great, but it starts too late and ends to early to be really counted upon to avoid the $50 cab ride from the airport. Cons: I had major problems with the keys working -- on one evening I had to go 5 times back and forth until the lock finally worked. Also there were a group of German (?) construction workers who loved -- LOVED -- to smoke, and this included their non-smoking rooms whose air circulation system ensured that everyone on the floor also smoked their cigarettes. One night was particularly bad with them smoking, drinking, playing music, long resounding belches. The hotel staff seemed either impotent to do anything about it or it was a business decision to keep these guys happy as they were long term customers.

The hotel staff were excellent and I was allocated a room at the back of the hotel. The room was large and included a king size bed and settee.

On the good side once the clouds lifted the view was spectacular looking over the mountains. The room was quiet and the bed comfortable and the internet was free.

The breakfast was typical of Holiday Inn Express with all the usual items of bagels, muffins, toast, fruit etc. It was served from 6.30 am and there were a few of us waiting to go in to the dining area at that time, I assume, mostly because of the time difference experienced by many of the guests. A couple from the east coast of Canada in their eighties were having a 3 day stay here before embarking on an Alaskan cruise. I was full of admiration for anyone staying here without own transport but especially so at their age - although they did seem very active and had their transport arrangements sorted out. The car parking arrangement suited us well, with your room key needed to enter the car park and again in the elevator to take you to any floor other than the lobby. The elevator was accessed from the underground parking area which was ideal. We did lunch one day at Tom and Jerry's across the road, which was just okay but didn't nourish the soul! If you have a satnav or a good map, I could recommend a pretty tree-lined small town in well-heeled west Vancouver called Dundarave and a restaurant called Dundarave Fish Market. The town also had a couple of coffee shops and other places to eat which I should have liked to have tried.

This 3.5 star hotel has a lot of ambiance and has a very quaint, peaceful quality to it. It has the feeling of a small & quiet inn, despite being located in the city. The decor is very tastefully done and even has an upscale feel to it. The beds, comforters, and linens were among the best I've seen in any hotel - very soft, thick, and comfortable. The lobby also has an upscale appearance. Apparantely, the recent renovation has been good for this hotel. The atrium is also a beautiful part of the hotel. The breakfast was also very good. It offered a wide variety of items, such as coffee, tea, milk, juices, hard-boiled eggs, breads, toast, danishes, cereals, and muffins. However, the best part of the breakfast that I enjoyed the most were the cinammon rolls! Very tasty! It was also nice to have free local calls, free parking, free daily morning newspaper, and did I mention the free continental breakfast? I also felt very safe, considering that you had to swipe your room key in order for the elevator to run and to get into the parking garage. My only complaints would be the fact that the hotel is a bit dated. This is very apparent in the parking garage and in some cases, the room. The room I was in also had a hole in the wall where an electrical outlet was supposed to be. Also, be careful not to get a room facing Hastings Street as the noise of the traffic can keep light sleepers awake. I also wanted to mention that this hotel is a bit farther out from downtown Vancouver, so a car is necessary, but I found the cost savings to be worth the extra trouble. Despite that, the location is convenient to the PNE and the Asian restaurant across the street is very good.
