It could be cleaner, and it looks very old (the room, the kitchen stuff, the elevators), but everything works as it should. Linens and towels get changed regularly, and the staff is helpful. The beds are not good, but \"sleepable\". The wireless internet is not very good at daytime, but it's just ok. It's very well located, there is a Metro station right in front of it, and places to eat around at walking range. For a long stay and for they're price I do recommend.", "Date": "July 21, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "2", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Florida", "Title": "\u201cGood Enough\u201d", "Author": "EarlFlorida", "ReviewID": "UR64334223", "Content": "We stayed here twice--once for six nights on our arrival and for a one night stay on our departure. The first stay was comfortable as the hotel provided just what we requested (no smoking, double bed and private bath). Some nights were 50 and others 55 Euros, depending on the night of the week. The breakfasts (included) were simple but adequate. The hotel staff was cold and mostly unhelpful. When we asked for a second (tiny) bar of soap, for example, we were told to go down the street and buy one at a nearby shop. The location, however, is great--central and near Metro station Alonso Martinez. On our return for an overnight, the receptionist acknowledged our booking for a double bed but was not able/willing to give us a double bed---we had to take what was available---two single beds. We asked the reception for airport terminal info but she was unwilling to help. We would classify this hotel as \"good enough\" but nothing to shout about.", "Date": "May 16, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Check in / front desk": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Location": "2", "Rooms": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "dublin", "Title": "\u201cWouldnt recommend the Andromeda\u201d", "Author": "foxychick77", "ReviewID": "UR7963941", "Content": "Service was very poor, staff were rude.
