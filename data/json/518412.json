Later the hotel charged me again for the same room, so I paid twice for the same service. I did not realize then, because it is not normal to be charged when you reserve a room, so I did not expect both charges on my credit card.Now both parties blame each other, but none of them make a refund to my credit card.Besides of this fraud, the hotel sucks. The bathrooms almost do not provide enough water to the shower so one cannot have a proper bath. They also do not care about your needs, the attention sucks. Rent a room on your own risk here and if you do it, do not use the web to reserve it. I can provide proof of all of this", "Date": "Jan 8, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR972805611", "Ratings": {"Service": "-1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "-1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "1", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "-1", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "MayaguezNerd"}, {"Content": "no!!!!!!! This hotel is absolutely terrible! Although it is located right across from an ok beach, there is nothing special about it. The room is very small and poorly designed. There was a glass tile located near the ceiling that light shine through all night. The sheets were very dirty and even had stains on them. The bed was soooo uncomfortable that we were unable to sleep at all. We actually left at 1:30 in the morning because of kids playing pinball and video games that were located right in the middle of all the guest rooms! People seemed to be getting drunk and getting rowdy also in the hallways. We were very disappointed. I'd rather sleep in my car!", "Date": "Aug 11, 2005", "ReviewID": "UR726715474", "Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "1", "Value": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member"}], "HotelInfo": {"HotelURL": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g664838-d518412-r20670379-Joyuda_Plaza_Hotel-Cabo_Rojo_Puerto_Rico.html", "HotelID": "518412", "Price": "$80"}}
