It's not a big room (but from what I have read in other New York hotel reviews that's the standard in NYC - unless you are willing to pay double or more than the Carvi) but we were out most of the day and evenings and only used the room to sleep and showers, so it was okay. Be aware that each bed only have one cover, but housekeeping brought us an extra blanket so we didn't have to share covers. The room was cleaned every day and in good conditions. I especially liked the built in room for suitcases under the beds, otherwise the room would have been very crowded with 3 girlie suitcases ;) The bathroom had just enough space for each of our toiletries, but one more hanger on the door would be nice. The robes and thick white towels were a very pleasant treat and so is the free wi-fi. We enjoyed a nice breakfast every morning at the wonderful diner with the sweetest waitress just across the street, where you get a Carvi discount (ask for coupon in reception). Looking forward to returning to the Carvi next weekend, but are happy it's just the 2 of us this time - because the beds are a little narrow when it's not your sweetheart you're sharing the bed with :) We never used the free in-room coffee maker, so can't comment on that - but it's there :)", "Date": "April 5, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Lancaster, PA", "Title": "\u201cI'll Take Manhattan...\u201d", "Author": "wildraisin", "ReviewID": "UR125229589", "Content": "A Valetine's getaway to The Big Apple found us lodged in the Upper East Side Carvi Hotel.

We hadn\u2019t been to NYC for 20 years and had no idea where to stay. As usual in this type of circumstance I turned to Trip Advisor. After much research we chose the Carvi due to the great reviews, good location, and reasonable rates (by NYC standards). When the cab dropped us off on East 55th Street, it took us a minute to find the hotel, as the front is very nondescript with the only sign being inconspicuous and on the awning overhead. At eye-level, the entranceway itself is totally blank with no signage and no d\u00e9cor of any kind (see photos). But the small lobby inside is nice, and all the people we met at the front desk were very friendly and helpful throughout our stay. We stayed on the fourth floor in a room facing the street. As others have noted, there are only 6 rooms per floor, and it appears that two of the rooms on each floor don\u2019t have any windows, as they are interior rooms. I would not have been happy had we been given one of those rooms; I believe they are, however, lower in price. Our room had two big windows facing the street, not really a great view, however, as all we really could see well was the office building across the street. The room itself was very clean and modern, and while not large, was roomy enough for us. It was well planned and had plenty of space for all of our clothes and other items. Especially nice was having the use of the mini-fridge, which we emptied of hotel items and filled with our own groceries (from nearby \u2018Klein\u2019s\u2019, a great grocery store about a 10-minute walk away). The bed was very comfortable, the sheets clean, and the shower was very powerful (although small in space). Everything in the room was super clean and fresh. There is a hair dryer, full-length mirror, safe, and free (fast) wifi in the room. But because it is a very small hotel, the hotel itself does not have many extras. For example, there is no restaurant or bar, and no fitness center. However, our main objective was to find a clean, modern hotel in a nice area with decent rates, and good, friendly service, and that\u2019s what we found at the Carvi. The neighborhood around the hotel is nice. We always felt safe there, even walking back to the hotel very late at night. And there are many convenient shops within a small area including a Starbucks, a 24-hour drug store, and many small restaurants and cafes. We especially liked the Pig \u2018n\u2019 Whistle Pub around the corner on 3rd Avenue (they have an excellent house-made veggie burger). Our only suggestions would be the following. There was only one chair in the room. This meant that one of us had to sit on the bed to eat our breakfast. Although the room was small, there was enough space near the windows for a small table and another small chair. Also, it would have been nice if there were a few pictures on the walls. The TV reception was not great as the picture pixated quite a bit at times. Also, there was no way to have only one of the two bedside lights on \u2013 it was both lights on at once or nothing, which meant that I couldn\u2019t read on my side of the bed (while my husband slept) without the light being on at his side of the bed. The other strange thing was the temperature control. Under the thermostat was an unfriendly sign saying that we were not to change the temperature, that if we wanted to change the temperature in the room we were to first call the front desk. We ended up changing it anyway, as we got cold during the night and the air conditioning was blowing right across the bed. Also, the a/c makes noise when it comes on and off during the night, and light sleepers might be bothered by this. Overall we found the hotel to be very quiet. However, on our last night (the only night we needed to get to sleep early) it appeared that the other rooms on our floor had been taken over by one family, who proceeded to leave their doors open and treat the whole floor as their own suite. They were quite noisy and we were about to call the front desk when they finally closed their doors sometime after 11:00pm. One thing we feel we should point out is the following. We noticed that there is a door outside the hotel entrance (i.e. essentially on the sidewalk) that leads directly up a flight of stairs with access into the hallways where the rooms are. This means that if that door is left ajar, anyone can access the hallways of the hotel without ever entering the lobby. The door is designed to lock after someone exits the hotel from this staircase, but it only does so if the person is careful to slam the door and make sure it is locked. On a few occasions we returned to the hotel to find this door ajar and unlocked. That being said, our complaints are minor and we do really like this hotel. We recommend it and plan to return again, as overall we had a very enjoyable experience at the Carvi.", "Date": "July 10, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Moscow, Russia", "Title": "\u201cGood hotel for solo trips\u201d", "Author": "anastasia_loboda", "ReviewID": "UR115113946", "Content": "Everyone knows how difficult it is to find a good and not ovepriced hotel in NY.

The bed was nice and firm but not to hard but the water pressure in the shower was incredible! Our room had a mildew smell but housekeeping took care of it and it was not an issue. The restaurant across the street acts as room service for this small hotel and guests of the Carvi get a 10% discount. The food is good and not over priced, we ended up eating there twice and both times enjoyed it. Overall, for what we paid for the room it was well worth it and I would stay there again. It may not be close to Times Square as other hotels but to not be in the hustle and bustle of the area is fine by me.

It is about a 10 minute walk from Grand Central Station or if that is too far for you there is a Metro station a block away. It was in walking distance to Times Square and Central Park. For fans of shopping Bloomingdales is only 4 blocks away. I would definitely recommend the Europa Cafe on 55th Street where we ate breakfast every morning. Just a short walk away but great food at great prices. Even the tea there was great which I did find a bit hit and miss in America! All in all Carvi is a great modern hotel in a fabulous location.

Room service is provided by the diner across the street and hotel guests receive a 10% discount on orders in the diner. We had breakfast there and ordered sandwiches to go for our flight home. Everything was fine and reasonably priced.", "Date": "April 21, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Boston, MA", "Title": "\u201cBest bed I have ever slept in!\u201d", "Author": "crvmp7", "ReviewID": "UR54823164", "Content": "I arrived in NY with my friend for a birthday party and we were unsure of what to expect from Carvi because it is so new.

With taxes and everything it was about $330 a night. For $330 a night I kind of expected a little better. The hotel is very small so no services. Of course I didn't need any but still, for $330 a night I guess I expected more. The room was the smallest I've been in outside of a Tokyo. The bed and room were fine and clean and the location as far as being convenient for exploring NYC was fine. Being my first time to NYC I didn't know where to stay although if I was to do it again I'd probably try to pick something near Soho or NYU in Greenwich Village. More stuff to do down there at night. The room we got was in the back facing another building. With the night shades open people can look directly in the room. There's some building air conditioner between the buildings that hums all night. I was able to sleep but I'd really prefer something more quiet, especially for the price. I guess ultimately I couldn't recommend it unless it was your one of your only options. Still, it was clean and the bed was comfortable which is sometimes enough.", "Date": "October 11, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Adelaide South Australia", "Title": "\u201cFantastic Hotel a real Gem in the middle of NewYork\u201d", "Author": "Gabriel999", "ReviewID": "UR42066496", "Content": "What a great Hotel, new with great facilities including a fridge and safety deposit box.

The hotel is very convenient to a couple of subway lines, but a bit of a hike if you have B'way theater tickets. I spent lots of time in the East Village, West Village and lower Manhattan, and sometimes wished I were closer to the 2 or 3 lines which were more east - so I ended up having to transfer a lot. Not that big of a deal. The room itself was very comfortable - coffee maker in room, free HBO on a nice flat-screen TV, marble bathroom and shower. Quiet location - even with my room facing the street. Starbucks on the corner, and a CVS drugstore a block away.

The reason for this, I found out, is that it just recently opened two months ago. I was traveling with my daughter (13 years) and my nephew (14) and we were in New York for a week. The room was very clean and for New York standards it was quite spacious. The bedding and linens are outstanding! I only stayed here for a night since we had already booked the rest of the trip in another hotel in Times Square, but I would happily return to this location instead. The manager, a very nice lady, came out one day to greet us and gave us a very warm welcome, she made us feel at home.

There were no ammenities to speak of, but, plenty of food, drink, deli, spa options on the street. There appears to be 6 rooms per 8 floors, served by a single elevator.
