For approximately 200 US dollars, I would expect a room to be large enough to allow a person to move about comfortably and store bags comfortably. Not so here. I have paid less for a one night stay at hotels that have had bigger and more attractive bedrooms (Residence Phou Vao in Luang Prabang, Laos is one example). I am sure some bathrooms in some five star hotels are bigger than my bedroom and bathroom COMBINED. Room would have been great had I been the size of a chihuahua, but I am not (5'10). 'Nuff said there. Bed is comfortable, and so is bathroom. Bathroom was clean. Both those factors are pluses. Never had dinner in the restaurant, but breakfast was decent. Had to lug 5 bags up and down the entrance stairway (before entering the building). Not good if you are on crutches or in a wheelchair.
