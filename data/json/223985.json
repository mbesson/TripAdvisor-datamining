The hotel boasts large rooms, opening windows, nice views and a quiet street for pleasant sleeping.

Nice, clean, comfortable lobby, easy check-in. We opted to park a block away in a secured, multi-level parking garage for $13/night vs the hotel's $23/night - highly recommend for those staying for a few days and not planning to use their car. The hotel was a 10-minute walk to the Inner Harbor, although we didn't realize that on our first day and took the free Charm City Circulator bus (we were the only tourists...mostly locals seemed to be using it and the route took a good 20+ minutes or more to get to the Inner Harbor area). We were just a few blocks from Little Italy where we enjoyed dinner one night at Amicci's followed by pastries and gelato across the street at Vaccaro's. We were also a 5-minute walk to the hub of the Fell's Point neighborhood - lots of pubs and shops made for a nice afternoon stroll. The pool was open from 5-10 daily and was small but just right for the toddler/elementary school crowd, ranging from 3 feet to 4 1/2 feet deep. The hot tub wasn't hot, more like warm bath water with bubbles, so for good or for bad, kids were allowed in. Complimentary coffee/tea/hot chocolate in the lobby every morning, and free cookies in the lobby if you hit it at the right time :) There was a good pizza/deli next door to the hotel (buyer beware...pizza was very good but $20 for a pie!)...Bagby's a block over was also recommended for good pizza. Around the corner was a Whole Foods so we picked up dinner one night and brought it back to our rooms to eat. Dinner at Shuckers in Fell's Point was just okay, but super-fresh sushi at the Kona Grill was delicious. The CVS around the corner came in very handy when we realized we forgot to pack toothpaste and one of our toothbrushes. If we were to return to Baltimore, I wouldn't hesitate to book our stay at this hotel again! One last note...one of the highlights of our trip was the dolphin show at the aquarium (buy your tickets and book your show time in advance!!!) and the American Visionary Art Museum for sculptures made from bottlecaps and statues of toothpicks (visual fun!).", "Date": "April 13, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "5.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Long Island, New York", "Title": "\u201cNice hotel, convenient location\u201d", "Author": "lag1009", "ReviewID": "UR127700286", "Content": "Hotel is not a full service hotel.

Similar to the other reviewers I found the rooms to be a bit small and the towels are probably the among the worst I have experienced in my 700+ nights at Marriotts. They try to offset the horrible towels by giving you three, but that does not make up for the most flimsy and worn towels you will see anywhere. Probably the biggest current issue with this hotel is the never ending road construction ouside the hotel. It has been going on since late last year and if you have a room facing the street you might get woken up with construction work starting early in the morning. The hotel has no control over this issue, but you should be aware. The only way to avoid this issue is to book a room that does not face the road. The only trouble with this solution is that there are no king size beds on the inner side. Not sure why the hotel only has doubles on that side!

Our requirements were: walking distance to the aquarium, indoor pool and reasonable price. This location more than met those requirements. We brought along another family and we asked for adjoining rooms when checking in. Even though we had reserved different room configurations, they were able to accommodate our request. Our room was very nice, with a king bed and pull-out couch for our son. The only strange thing was that the pack of linens only contained a single flat sheet, a thin blanket and a pillow. So I did have to request another sheet so that he's have something between his body and the blanket. In addition, our room faced Aliceanna Street, where there was street construction. So every time a car went over the steel plates on the road, there was a loud noise. The kids were so tired from the pool they barely noticed, but it woke us up a few times. Totally not the hotel's fault, of course. The pool area was great for the kids and it's nice to see a hotel pool with a lifeguard. He did a great job keeping the other group of preteen boys under control and keeping the noise down. The other patrons and the staff were all so friendly. The other great thing was being able to park in the attached garage.

We were happy to get both early check-in and late check-out. 2. The breakfast buffet had an incredible selection and was a great value. The staff even went so far as to bring my coffee to my room as my hands were already full and provide us with a corkscrew as I left mine at home. Plus, they had a complementary sparkling cider toast on NYE, and fresh cookies in the afternoon! 3. The bartender knew the exact price of the drink I requested and I was happy that my drink was not over-priced as so many other hotel lobby bars can be. 4. The Hotel Manager exceeded my expectations as we could not find a restaurant that would accommodate our large party for dinner. He offered the use of a private dining area for us to enjoy our dinner.

I then called the front desk to report the malfunction. A few minutes later a maintainance man came to the room and fixed the AC. We then decided to take a nap before going to a nearby restaurant. Unfortunately, our room faced an adjacent building that had huge air handling machinery on its roof. The machinery created a continuous, loud roaring sound, similar to a jet engine.

The location was not as convenient as I expected. It is in the Harbor area, but still about 8 blocks from the Harbor. The hotel is much like all other Marriotts, pretty and clean. It has its own attached parking garage ($22 per night), bar and lounge in lobby, and good breakfast. The room was comfy and clean, no tub just stand up shower. We had a king size room with pull out sofa, and extra linens are provided for sofa. Now the bad news, check in and check out was horrible! Like all hotels we held the reservation with a credit card. However, I decided to pay cash upon arrival for everything, including incidentals. The staff at the counter did not know how to check us in! The second I said \"cash\", they needed to consult with eachother. Finally after about 15 mins we got checked in and our rooms were ready early as requested. Unfortunately, check out was the same nightmare. They didnt give me my complete refund back from incidentals, and a manager was not available to fix the problem. It was entered in computer incorrectly. I agreed to call the next day to resolve, but decided to let it slide because they paid for our parking instead. That following wednesday to my amazement Marriott had charged the FULL amount of our stay to my credit card! I was given the excuse that it happened because that is the credit card I used to hold the reservation! After several phone calls, the manager called my bank directly to have the funds released. Overall, not worth the headache and we will not stay there again. In my opinion, staff should be prepared for all situations.

We chose the Courtyard in Baltimore's Inner Harbor based on it's location, the great winter promotional price, reviews & the Marriott chain's consistent quality. This Courtyard hotel did not disappoint. It is conveniently located in Harbor East, a short walk or quick bus ride from the attractions of the inner harbor. The Charm City Circulator Orange Route bus (free) stops near the hotel making travel to/from the hotel & inner harbor easy. There are several restaurants, a Starbucks, & a movie theater in the immediate area. Little Italy & Fells Point are close by as well. The room & furnishings were extremely clean. The bedding & linens were not extremely plush or luxurious but were comfortable & clean. The size of the room was ample with enough room for the two beds & side chair. There would be enough room for a cot if needed. Our room overlooked a rooftop area of a lower level of the building & faced attached floors of an office building. The view might not have been spectacular but the room was very quiet. There was a small indoor pool with a hot tub on the 4th floor. The pool was staffed by a life-guard which must be the reason for the limited pool hours during the weekdays. The pool & pool area were clean & well maintained, but the pool water was too cold for us to enjoy the water. Overall the front desk customer service was helpful, quick & accommodating. The service at breakfast over the three night stay was somewhat inconsistent with service sometimes being slow & sometimes having to wait for eggs to be refilled on the buffet. We were not told until the third morning that we could order eggs or omelets made to order with the buffet. We had a room rate that included daily breakfast. One afternoon our key card did not work. The front desk gave us another one but did not ask for ID which is a safety concern. Also, we returned to our room one morning to find the housekeeper cleaning it & were able to go in & out with out being questioned. Hopefully, management will address these safety concerns with their staff.

There were some cigarette butts on my balcony and I noticed the same dirty towel two consecutive days in the fitness center. Additionally the weights in the fitness center are worthless and should be replaced or simply discarded. Also, the bread in the breakfast buffet appeared old as if was kept out for consecutive days.

The rooms are pretty basic courtyard rooms...on the ugly side without much atmosphere. I have stayed in better Courtyards! Most of the stadd was nice if a little clueless. One supervisor was rather short with many guests....somewhat unprofessional in his demeanor. The hotel is located near a CVS, Whole Foods and lots of restaurants. The mexican place around the corner was very good but hte burger place next door was lousy. It's about a 20 minute walk over to the fun stuff in Inner Harbor.

In other hotels with similar \"breakfast rooms,\" the breakfast was included in the room rate, It is not included here, unless one books a rate with breakfast. The Courtyard should post a notice to that effect at the entrance to the breakfast room because patrons at two other tables were (like us) surprised to be given a bill for breakfast, because they thought breakfast was included. At $10.00 each for a breakfast buffet that was OK but no better than the free breakfasts in similar hotels, we all concluded we would not have ordered had we been aware it was not included.

My only complaint was that there was a speaker on the wall that emitted a continuous very soft staticky noise which was tremendously annoying when I was trying to fall asleep. I only noticed it after turning off everything else in the room, so if you have extremely good hearing it may be bothersome to you and I ended up turning on the fan to help drown out the noise. I am not sure what the purpose of the device is, maybe it acts as a fire alarm. The hotel is expensive, which I think is more due to the location than the amenities, and there is an additional maybe $15 of taxes on top per day, due to Baltimore state tax. There is a Whole Foods store inside of the same building which you can go to for groceries and they also sell a hot breakfast which is cheaper than the one in the Courtyard restaurant. Ask at the front desk how to get there. There are taxis waiting outside continuously for your convenience. There do not seem to be any places to go to within walking distance of the hotel, however. Overall, I was pleased with my stay, but not the price.", "Date": "January 2, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "4", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "East Coast", "Title": "\u201cSmart Choice\u201d", "Author": "kasey363", "ReviewID": "UR8699885", "Content": "As a fairly frequent visitor to Baltimore (known as Fenway South) during Red Sox vs Orioles games; this location and Courtyard was a great find! I had stayed in inner harbor (YIKES$$$$$) times before and had decided to stay cheaper close to the airport for the weekend - but found this location days before the weekend and was psyched I did! First - I'm a rewards memeber so I stay at lots of Marriotts (at all levels) and are seldom disappointed - but being a city person I know the \"location\" can be the \"make or break\"in a city - especially in Baltimore which definaitely has a \"gritty\" side/feel to it (not necessairly a bad thing - but a consideration for safety). This location in Harbor East was excellent. We (two females) felt perfectly safe walking in area both to and from Inner Harbor, and Fells Point in both day and night. We walked and took the water taxi ($8.00 for the day - great value and just two blocks to this hotel from the landing). I really liked that on this side of the harbor you had both the conveience of walking to all inner harbor has, and in the other direction (about four blocks) you were in Fells Point with all it's shops, restaurants, local Foodie Market (like Lexington Market in Philly and so many other cities) and bars (local and touristy) galore. We ate a \"Angie's\" in the open market (local counter service and you can't beat a great down home lunch for most under $5.00!) Note: there are also two water taxi stops in the Fells Point Area (from inner harbor) so you have that option too and then you can easlity walk back to hotel. The hotel itself is new, clean, spacious. Restaurant on site for breakfast buffett (not complimentary) - we didn't partake - not with great local breakfast joints so close - but buffet looked pretty good. Service was pleasant (and it was a very busy weekend) and responsive. All the usual amenities of a Coutyard and even more so - several computer to use free of charge, had a small bar and nice sit down areas with flat acreen TV's, couches, tables etc. One late night after game we got take-out from a inner harbor restaurant - took the water taxi back and ate in this \"living room\" area (not to stink up the room) - it was great. Others were having wine and beers another section watching TV. Nice touch. The best thing though for this \"inner harbor\" convenience and to be so close to Fells Point and Little Italy area (which is just another few blocks north of the hotel (save that for next time!) was that the cost was extremely reasonable ($179.00 AAA rate for Sat). All other hotels in the inner harbor (and the Marriott Inner Harbor which is a block next to this Courtyard) were in the $300-$500 range. To stay at the airport (Springhill Suites I had booked was $139.00) and to have to take the light rail to and from this inner harbor area for the difference of approx $40.00 was a no-brainer! You were right in local inner harbor area - great deal! My choice for all future trips to Baltimore - can't beat the quality and certainly the location. Also for those of you whom drive - parking garage is right next to entrance - reasonable for a city. And also - Whole Foods in same block of buiidling - great take out eats, good stuff for picnic etc and a new Starbucks right around the corner opening very soon.", "Date": "September 12, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "3.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Archbald, Pennsylvania", "Title": "\u201cGood and bad\u201d", "Author": "JDK5", "ReviewID": "UR8611062", "Content": "Hotel was decent, but staff was not very friendly.

We were in town for the Antiques Roadshow that was in town for the day. The hotel is in a rapidly expanding area just slighty off the Inner Harbor in Little Italy section of Baltimore. There is alot of contstruction of luxury condos so the area is in a state of flux. One of the big plusses is that the hotels share the same building as a Whole Foods Market where if you dont want to go out to eat and just want to chill in the room you can pick something up and take to your room. The hotel staff was friendly and answered any questions we had with courtesy and a smile (this should be a given for hotels but unfortunately it is not so). The room was very clean and the bed was just right. Parking is $13.25 per day (if you dont use your car) but if you plan to drive around during your stay you can have your parking ticked validated by the hotel staff and you can have unlimited acess in or out for $19 per day. There is an abundance of restaurants in the area for all types of food. We enjoyed Mo's Crab and Pasta for lunch and Della Notte for Sunday brunch (it is pricey but the food is exellent and you get live jazz while you eat). The hotel is a 10 min walk to the Harbor and shopping so that isnt overwhelming especially on a nice breezy summer day.
