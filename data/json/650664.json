This area is hip and trendy, and much less touristy than other areas; it has an authentic feel to it, and there's lots of shade and not much traffic (this is a blessing at night - no Vespa drone!). It is full of little boutiques and restaurants, along side simpler more traditional groceries and convenience stores. The hotel itself left something to be desired. The rooms were clean enough, but small and poky. The shower was only about 2 feet square, the water temperature varied (not a problem in the very hot weather, but would have been awful at a different time of year), and the shower head kept falling off its holder. The soap and bath mat/towel weren't replaced automatically, and we couldn't get hold of an iron at all, despite learning the Italian for this and asking for it several times. We were told first that we would get one, then that it was a safety hazard and then that the iron was broken. There was air conditioning but it took a while to cool the room. There were no facilities for making tea or coffee in the room, but there was a TV and a fridge. The fridge contained cold drinks costing about 2 euros each. We filled our own water bottles and put them in the fridge to save money, but these were mistaken by staff for hotel bottles and we were charged for two bottles we did not drink. Breakfast consisted of coffee and a croissant - the only other food on offer was stale bread, packaged Melba toast, packaged rye bread, processed ham and a kind of orange squash to drink. Staff were friendly enough and helped us when asked, but we didn't feel that anyone was going overboard to be welcoming or proactive. We resorted to writing a note in Italian (cobbled together from a phrasebook!), to ask for the things we needed, and leaving it in our room for staff to find. This seemed to work!

She had never been to Rome before, and I was hoping to make it an unforgettable, romantic experience! I am a very keen traveller, and so have learnt the hard way that it is always best to check hotel reviews on the internet before booking anywhere. Seeing that this hotel had better than average reviews, and was the right price for my budget, I booked a double room there. I must say that thanks to this hotel, our first 2 days in Rome were DEFINITELY not romantic. In fact, I would describe the experience I had at this hotel as HORRIFIC and totally unacceptable. You can be rest-assured that I will be going on to EVERY travel site I can find and relaying my experience of your hotel to anyone and everyone and recommending that they stay ANYWHERE but your hotel. My girlfriend and I checked in on Thursday 31st December 2009. We asked to book a taxi to take us to the restaurant where we were to spend the New Year celebrations, but were told that this was unnecessary, and to just come down to reception when we were ready... I was a bit dubious about this, but bowed to (what I thought was) their superior knowledge of the Roman taxi service. The first thing we noticed was that the room was MOST DEFINITELY not as advertised on the website... It was almost ridiculously small, with the furniture only just fitting in. Clearly not the spacious room that was shown in the photos on the website! There was paint peeling off the walls and the room was certainly not as clean as I'd have expected! I am actually very surprised that the hotel staff aren't embarrassed to even show these rooms to potential guests if they all look like that. Having had a long journey to Rome, we just decided to make the best of the situation. However, when we came to get ready to go out for New Year's Eve celebrations, I went to have a shower and found that there was no hot water!! I went to complain and was told to wait 20 minutes, so I returned to my room. 20 minutes later... STILL no hot water. I returned to the desk to complain and the man there went to run some water, and finally agreed that there was no hot water (AS IF I WAS LYING!!). He went up into the attic to check the tanks and asked me to watch the desk (!!). When he returned he said that the tanks were fine, so I should wait for longer!! We waited another 30 minutes, but were getting close to our reservation time at the restaurant so had to go out without showering properly!!! We came to reception to ask for a taxi, and (surprise surprise) the receptionist could not get through to a taxi firm! He told us to wait, causing me to have to call the restaurant to change our reservation!! Eventually, we told him to forget it and just walked out, hailing a taxi on the way. When we got back, we got almost no sleep because the window in the room was literally right on a road where people were walking up and down and shouting until early in the morning (I appreciate that this, at least, is out of the hotel's control, but include it to demonstrate what a terrible experience I had in your hotel)! The next day, we got up to find that there was STILL NO HOT WATER!! I went to reception to complain, and YET AGAIN, had to spend a long time trying to convince the receptionist and the maids that I was not, in fact, lying and that there was no hot water! Again, we had to go out without properly showering! I decided that there was NO WAY I was going to allow my girlfriend to spend another night in this disgrace of a hotel. As such, we found another hotel that had the BASIC AMENITIES that this hotel clearly struggles with. We returned to the hotel and I told the receptionist that we were checking out because I was disgusted with the room and the lack of hot water. He shrugged as if he didn't care at all... Although he did give a grudging apology. While I was there, other guests came in to complain about the hot water and were told that it would be fixed hopefully in a couple of hours!!!! Then I was told that I had to pay the full amount for staying in the hotel even though I was checking out after only one night (of the 3 nights booked) there!! He did, however, say \"We won't charge you for what you have used from the mini-bar though\" (we didn't even use the mini bar!!), as if this was something I should be very grateful for!!", "Date": "January 15, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "4.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Carlisle, England", "Title": "\u201cGreat Location & Staff\u201d", "Author": "mumandgirl", "ReviewID": "UR34288147", "Content": "We stayed here for three nights - we were initially thrown by the outer renovation work, but when inside it didn't disturb us at all.

Although we were greatly saddened that our team did not win, we were delighted by the fact that Rome is such a beautiful city. Very interesting. It seemed that people through the years have molded their modern lives around the ancient structures of the city- very well preserved. Now to review Hotel Ivanhoe, I would recommend this gem of a hotel to visitors of Rome. It is very good value for money. Europe is an old civilisation and unless you are staying in the outskirts of oldie worldie city, you will not find modern building structures/ hotels anyway. What is the point of paying an arm and a leg for an old building to sleep in when you can use that money for many other holiday treats. Hotel Ivanhoe's interiors has had a thorough re-furbed in the last 2 years. The rooms, common areas and hallway are all looking polished and new. The linens and towels still have the fresh feel to them. The room we had on the 4th floor was a good size. I like the way they have the wardrobes hanging on the wall, hence, freeing more floor space. The bathroom looked clean and modern. No moldy presence that you find in old hotels. Ok, the shower cubicle is on the small size. My husband and I are average to smallish size and we did not find it impossible to fit in the shower cubicle. However, for super size visotors, it can border challenging to maybe impossible. Hmmm, I recommend walking all around Rome to be able to fit in the shower cubicle then :). At present the hotel is covered in scaffolding which frightened me upon our arrival. However, a lady coming out of the hotel very calmly assured me it is not bad as it looks. Indeed, once inside the hotel, there were no sign or sound of construction apart from very muttered noise mid day. But hey, we were long out and about exploring in the day time. Surely the hotel's exterior works will be done and ready by this summer time. Location- superb. From airport, take train to Termini central station, costs 11 euros. At termini, keep underground and walk towards the bus terminal where you will find the metro line. Take line Blue line B heading towards Laurentina. Metro cost is 1 euro. Alight on the first stop- CAVOUR. When you get over ground, you'll be on Via Cavour. Look for the other Metro Sign (right in front of you - this is the opposite Metro direction) and cross the road. Down the steps into Via Urbana. turn right and 30 m to your left is Hotel Ivanhoe. it has a caffe with outdoor seatings on a platform atatched right outside the hotel's foyer. The reception staff we have met were all friendly and spoke many languages. Eleonor from the reception gave us a perfect instruction to get to the Vatican on the day of our arrival and stored our suitcases for us (as we have arrived early before check-in time). We have found Al fresco restaurants and cafe/bars close by. Explore and you'll be pleasantly surprised by what is around the hotels. We were fascinated by the LIbrerias everywhere that doubles up as drinking bars/clubs at night. You can walk the whole of Rome and find a historical site at every turn. Close to the hotel is the Colosseum, Forum, Campidoglio, Vittorio Emmanuelle Mounument. Just across Cavour is the San Pitro in Vincoli which has the shackles of St. Peter and the marble statue of Moses. Of course, walk towards Termini and you'll find Santa maria de Maggiore. A must to Rome visitor, take the Metro to the Spanish Steps, enjoy the scenery. We found a bar on the left hand side of the steps (as you go up) with spectacular view. Down at the bottom of the steps, walk via Condotti and enjoy the posh designers name, even if you only do window shopping. Walk along Via Corsa to Trevi Fountain and then head to the Panteon. This shuts at 5 pm. The Panteon faces a lovely quaint Piazza with lots of al fresco restaurants. You must dine here and take a photo with the Pantheon behind you. Tables are lit with candles by 8 pm and buskers of world class talent performs in the Piazza. Food and wine is good and what more, the atmosphere will make your dining experience magical. No one is in a hurry dining in Rome. Take your time, stay as long as you please. The vatican tour is a whole day affair. It only costs 8 euros to get in Vatican Museum and free to go in St. Peter's Basilica, but missing the queue is worth the 40 euros you pay the tour guide touted just as you alight the Metro at Ottaviano. The guides are well informed and makes your appreciation of the art work and history present more enjoyable. That's all for now. Arriverdeci!

I went to an internet cafe and selected Ivanhoe, it did not have great comments on TA but it had great reviews on Venere. I followed my instints. What could be worst at this time? I called them and they had a room for us. We walked from Via Veneto to the Ivanhoe. It was almost half the money of what we were paying at the other one, it was safe, quiet, and beautiful. Now I underestand why most people call it a little gem. The location is excellent, at walking distance to everything in the ancient city. We took a taxi to the vatican and it was only 7 euros. With the money we saved we were able to get a taxi to the airport (40 euros) They have a full time staff that made us feel at home. Yes, the shower was small but I was ok with it. The room was extremely clean and decorated with good taste and everythink looked new. The breakfast was the best that we had in the whole european trip. The girls up front were so nice and informative. The romms are not extremely big but this is standard in europe. The rooms had every thing you need.

Although I wasn't going to be too fussy being in Rome for one night, the place was a lot better than I expected and I have stayed in a lot less appealing hotels calling themselves 3 star or higher. The room and decor was immaculate and in fact all the areas of the hotel including the lobby and breakfast room were very polished and professional with a very pleasant staff on hand too. I felt really comfortable here and considering the place has a roof garden to enjoy drinks (for a 2 star hotel!?) and is right within the action, two minutes from Cavour Metro station and very close to the Coloseum and Roman Forum, this place was a real 'find' and I was delighted with it. I'm not going to tell you it's luxurious and has all the trappings of wealth but for a budget hotel?

We were adviced this hotel by a travel agent. Due to lack of time I was not able to check this site for reviews, but...below my findings. The hotel is the 3-star rating worth. Eventhough everything is extremely small (especially the shower, which caused many laughs by us) it was all clean, simpel and it was all there. shower, toilet, sink, bed, closet, tv etc... However...it was very noisy so hard to sleep. Also the TV does not really work and has none of the international networks on. Also NO internet in the rooms. Futhermore breakfast is a joke. You only get from everything 1. (1 croissant, 2 slices of bread with only jam, 1 drink and coffee) so if you are a big eater...then this definetely won't do. Furthermore the people were very helpful and friendly. Also the hotel has a very nice Cafeterria where we hang out and had our extra breakfast :-) .....however they close at 8 pm...so you can't hang here. Location is perfect, walking distance from the Colleseum and the Forum! But...i won't stay here again. It was all ok...but not worth the money.", "Date": "September 12, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "1.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Seattle, WA", "Title": "\u201cStay away if you value taking showers or baths!!!\u201d", "Author": "thomaabi", "ReviewID": "UR18149208", "Content": "This hotel is small and just a few blocks from the Colosseum and a metro station. When I say small I mean really small. I'm a 6'2\" american weighing in at 220lbs and my main problem with this hotel is it's bath rooms - they are literally water closets. I first stayed in a room with a tub - probably 3 shoulder widths by two shoulder widths (you'll soon see why I use shoulder widths for measurement-the kind the tailer would measure and nothing extra). BUT this tub had a hug graduated step right in the middle of it. I think it was meant for you to take a shower while sitting down. I dreamt the same night on my rock hard bed and thin slice of pillow that I would die in the same bathroom having accidently slipped. The next day I switched rooms and got a regular shower with a rigid sliding curtain. Now this one was 1.5 shoulder widths long by 1 shoulder width wide. The water handle control was right where my tummy was and I had to make sure I didn't breathe in deeply or I would shut off the water! To lather up I had to turn off the water, open the rigid curtain and turn around. For 160 euros a night I find myself in the shower adventure of a lifetime. On a positive note they provide breakfast in the morning but all it is is dry croissant, bread, toast, and whatever coffee you like. (The coffee in Italy is awesome, and applies here also). If I wasn't staying with family I'd check into a hostel or maybe re-budget and get a better place. This place isn't for big people like me or even people half my size - you really have to be a midget to enjoy this place.", "Date": "July 22, 2008"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Hotel Ivanhoe", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g187791-d650664-Reviews-Hotel_Ivanhoe-Rome_Lazio.html", "Price": "$77 - $183*", "Address": "<address><span rel=\"v:address\"><span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">Via de Ciancaleoni 49 - Via Urbana 50</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:postal-code\">00184</span> <span property=\"v:locality\">Rome</span></span>, <span class=\"country-name\" property=\"v:country-name\">Italy</span> </span></span></address>", "HotelID": "650664", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/ProviderThumbnails/dirs/b2/bf/b2bf27caf3d059c43465bb62d18864937large.jpg"}}
