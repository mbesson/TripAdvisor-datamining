There was no hot water and the beach does not look like anything on line. You have to push back a huge rusty gate,manuever down a small cliff to get to the trash strewn beach.Once there it is almost impossible to swim. The water is extremely rough with 15 foot waves and a rip-tide. Stray dogs ran all around the resort and no one cleaned up after them. My kids have flea bites all over their legs,the room was loaded with fleas. There is no internet or cell phone service because the resort is blocked by a \"mountain\".

I head read reviews and was a bit worried about what I had gotten myself into. Turns out I had nothing to worry about. The room was clean, if not a bit musty smelling (which was quickly fixed by opening our patio doors.) There was a small fridge, ancient looking coffee pot (you do have to buy the coffee from a vending machine) and iron. The room is great sized. The wardrobe in it is very nice and roomy. The entire wall of doors/windows was fantastic (which had a regular sliding glass door lock and the metal pin that slides through both doors that is very typical of a sliding glass door lock.) Toilet worked fine. Lots of towels. Clean sheets. Zero cockroaches or other bugs were seen in our room. No mold, either. Maybe we were just lucky? The pool was clean, except right after a massive storm. Then there were bugs in the pool. Go figure. It's true that there are turtles being kept in something that looks like a fenced off fire pit. It's pretty filthy and there are a lot of turtles in there. I felt bad for them. No, the fountain didn't work, but I didn't see any exposed electrical wires anywhere. There is no highway you have to cross to get to the beach. Where do people get this? Or that there's traffic on it?? There's a road that is barely more than a bike path, which is blocked off to vehicles, that separates Costa Dorado's property from the beach. If you go down to the beach from Costa Dorada's back gate, you have to do a bit of careful manuvering down the sand/rocks to get to the rocky beach. Or you can walk 3 minutes to the left and walk directly onto the gorgeous, beautiful beach (where it is completely rock free. I have pictures to attest to this.) I did like that there was a shower type thing (like they have when you leave most beaches) when you first walk back onto the property so you can spray off the sand from the beach. The only time I was afraid was when I was swinging on the hammock, reading, and a giant coconut dropped from the tree the hammock was tied to. This prompted me to go back in my room and read. Otherwise, you're not supposed to be on the grass. We never ate there so we can't attest to the food quality. There is, however, a restaurant right down the street that has amazing coconut flan. The pool supposedly closes at some hour every night, but both nights I was there I was in the pool until 2 AM. No one said a word to us. The game room wasn't open the first night, but it was the second night. And other reviewers are correct in saying the resort isn't close to any of the \"main attractions.\" It makes it quiet with mostly secluded beaches! We were glad to be so far away from everything else! The hotel staff were by no means rude. They helped us when we asked, but left us alone otherwise. We were given neon colored bracelets to wear (like you get at a club) but as soon as I saw that some of the Puerto Rican guests weren't wearing theirs, I took mine off. I had it on for less than 6 hours. No one said anything to me and I left and came back to the hotel at least 3 times a day. There are no real parking spots to the hotel, so you sort of make them up as you go ad hope everyone else follows suit. The parking lot does flood when it rains. Oh, they do charge $3 a day for maid service. Really, I have no complains with this \"resort.\" Would I call it a resort? No. A decent hotel on a crime ridden island? Yes. It's on a beach and tropical. That's the feel I had from the hotel. Would I stay there again? Only if it wasn't so expensive.

I also heard that Villa Monta\u00c3\u00b1a (in Isabela) is also a good hotel. Don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t stay if you want to save money. Rincon of the Seas and Rincon Beach Resort are better. Also there are many guesthouses in Rincon with excellent service. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m a surfer who lives in Ponce, PR and believe me Costa Dorada is the worst.

This is the first thing that comes to my mind, a resort?? Who named this place a resort? Areas are dirty, all the rails by the stairs are so full of rust that I'm surprised they have not falled off. In the bar by the pool the very rude waitress charged my husband who is american $4 for a small perrier water. When he told me (I'm puertorican) I went back and she got very nervous so gave me $1 back, charging him more because she thought he was a gringo tourist. My husband only stayed 10 minutes inside the pool because it was so filthy you could not even see the bottom, an old and rusty jacuzzi by the pool full of bugs, the kids pool dirty and full of bugs also. Now if you're shocked wait until you hear this! The rooms are nothing like they have in their advertisement. An old, cheap and dirty mattress that would not stay in place, sheets had old stains God knows from what, a/c was blowing in my face but that's how the room is arranged. Coffemaker yes with 2 cups and one of them very dirty yeak! oh but no coffee....yes you have to buy the coffee in a vending machine for the price of $2.....the shower made me gag because it was so dirty and ants all over the walls, curly black hair by the toilet!! we both have ash blonde hair. No guides in the room to where was the restaurant located, if they had room service, ammenities located or nothing. My husband and I had to look for everything by ourselves and then they have so many rules like no food or drinks in the rooms, no visitors, etc...When they told us that in the reception we felt we were going into a prison. All this for the price of $169.00 dollars per night. With this kind of money we could have stayed at a 5 star hotel. We will never stay there again and I am going to make sure these people get visited by the Health department. My husband says any motel would have been better.

We always travel with my children and my mother so the villa worked out well. Everyone had there own space. Since it was still the off season it was relatively quiet. The down side of this is that not all of the amenities were available during our entire stay. (The villa cabana was closed during the week as was the gift shop). We deemed this a small price to pay for the home style comfort and convenience we did have. We will definately be going back.

We paid $130 for a room that looked like a cheap hotel room (a la Motel 6).

Most of the staff were rude to us, because we were Americans. Although the grounds were beautiful, the restaurant was totally over-priced for mediocre food. We were forced to pay $9 for a breakfast buffet and were not given directions about food tickets or bracelets to wear at the resort pool. we felt we were treated badly because we were Americans and will never stay at this so called \"resort\" again. There were many Puerto Ricans spending their holiday weekend at the Resort the same night we were, and they were given instant attention and extra care. We were not even given a high chair for our daughter after making a request. When 2 other Puerto Rican couples came to dinner with small children...they were brought high chairs immediately.
