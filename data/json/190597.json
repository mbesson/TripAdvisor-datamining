We were also given very useful maps of Berlin. We stayed in a lovely spacious comfortable room with a separate toilet and shower rooms and a great little balcony. Although it was within a very short walk to the main road of ku'damm it felt very homely. The breakfast was lovely prepared by the ppl who run it in front of you every morning and although they had set times it was very flexible. It had a good selection of fresh fruit salad, whole fruit, nuts, muesli, selection of cereals, yogurt, fruit juice, cheese, cold cuts, boiled eggs, a good selection of teas and coffees. Coffee and tea available all day and night at no extra charge and there is a help-yourself bar (at very reasonable prices) with nibbles (crisps, cheese puffs & pretzels) available even when the reception was closed after hours and a chart where drinks consumed were noted down and paid for at the end of your stay. The breakfast room could also be used as a living room which is where the bar was in the evenings. Unfortunately the old style 'cage' lift was broken for the whole duration of our 5-day stay as they were waiting on the rare spare parts to arrive and with the hotel located on the fourth floor of a block of apartments it was a little bit of a workout going up and down the stairs, great for burning off nibbles at bar! Not so great when carrying heavy suitcases up the stairs but we were offered help. Upon check-in a key to the downstairs main door is also handed over with room key. This hotel was a great option for us as we met up with friends and their two children so at night they would put kids to sleep next door to us and we would socialize on our balcony. By no means is this a 'regular' hotel with a lobby and large hotel facilities, room service and all the bonus, no gym, no pool but we did not need any of that and it was a very pleasurable safe, clean stay at reasonable prices. Rooms were cleaned daily unlike the balcony, a very small minus. Another small minus, could not get the wireless internet although owner supplied us with password and only had a signal around the reception area. Luckily we were too busy to mind. Location is great! There were bus stops and metro stations within a short walking distance as well as restaurants and shops. All in all a very good choice.", "Date": "July 17, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "The Hague", "Title": "\u201cFantastic little hotel near Kurfuerstendamm\u201d", "Author": "prasenberg", "ReviewID": "UR106658484", "Content": "I don't like big chain hotels, I like my hotels to have some character. It doesn't get any better than the Hotel Art Nouveau in Berlin. Located on the 2nd and 4th floor of an apartment building, it oozes atmosphere.

Shops, including restaurants, are nearby. The rooms have a small TV, excellent and free wifi, a small bathroom, nice beds and a beautiful desk. They are maybe slightly smaller than you'd expect, but they were large enough for me. The hotel serves breakfast and in a nice touch: you can get a drink or some food at night too.

The two of us have stayed at the Hotel two other times and felt that we were returning home again. It is great to feel that you know the hotel and the neighborhood. Christine and Gerd are wonderful hosts and are always available to suggest museums and other activities and have a wonderful list of restaurants, stores and nightclubs in the Savignyplatz area. The hotel is well situated since it is near 3 S-bahn lines and a U-bahn stop is only a few blocks away. This time we had a few problems and Gerd was always available to get boots fixed for us or obtain over the counter drugs we needed. We were able to tell him what we needed and it was available on our return at the end of the day. The rooms are very tastefully decorated by Christine in an electic manner - a few antiques, cute sayings, modern pictures by up and coming artists, wall hangings, and vibrant colors on the walls. The rooms are very spacious- this time my husband and I were upgraded to a suite and our kids had regular rooms. The beds and the linens are high quality and it was hard to get up and get going in the morning. Since it was the Christmas season, we had a special treat one night - Gluhwein made by Gerd (as my son said, lots of alcohol just like he liked it) and Christine's homemade Christmas cookies. When we arrived, Gerd made us a special cocktail to toast our arrival and he gave us suggestions for our visit to Berlin. He also had a suggestion for a restaurant open on Christmas Eve when most of the restaurants are closed. The joy of staying at this Hotel is the pesonal service. Christine and Gerd truly want you to experience Berlin and they go the extra mile to make sure that you have a wonderful experience. They are happy to make reservations for you. They find out what you are interested in and then go the extra mile to help you enjoy your visit. It is a much more personal experience than staying in a big hotel. The honor bar is also a big plus - it is fully stocked with wine, beer and soda and juice. If you would like something else, you tell them and they will get it for you. When we were there in 2009, we were there for Father's Day (same day as Himmelfahrt) and they gave all the fatherss little bottles of sekt to celebrate the occasion. At the end of the day, this is a great place to stay because of all the personal service but if you need a lobby and room service, try a big hotel. PS - This December Berlin had snow - the Christmas Markets were magical with all the smells, food, wine etc. And all the Christmas lights.

The owners of the small property are very friendly and go out of their way to help you with your travel plans.

On my last visit they recommended a special lunch deal at the Michelin-starred restaurant in the Swissotel. It was an extrordinary 3-course meal for about 25 euros. They also sent us to Rogacki, a fabulous Berlin seafood bar known only to locals. Very off the beaten path and inexpensive. Example: three fresh Normandy oysters and a generous glass of white wine for a mere 7 euros. I saw quibbles in a previous post about small TVs, no fresh juice, and lukewarm coffee. If those things are really important go to one of the boring, impersonal chain hotels where you'll pay an extra 20 euros for breakfast...but the TV will be good.

The hotel is almost on the corner of Mommsenstra\u00dfe and Leibnizstra\u00dfe and is a 10 minute walk from the S-Bahn Station - Savignyplatz. The Hotel itself is located on the 4th floor of a beautiful art deco building. You go up to the 4th floor via an old parisian inspired wrought iron lift and are greeted by the front door of the hotel. The hotel is run by Mr and Mrs Schlenka - who speak perfect English and are very friendly and helpful. We arrived late on Thursday evening (day before Good Friday) and they made provisions for us to collect our keys from the Sushi Bar on the ground floor. The next morning at breakfast they greeted us and welcomed us to Berlin. We stayed in the Japanese Room (Room 1) and it was very comfortable indeed. A large room (around 16 foot square) with a small en-suite bathroom in the corner. The bed was SO comfortable, and it was so light and airy. The only bad thing I have to say about it, is that the duvet was so warm and snugly that it was hard work to get up in the morning! It was so comfortable! Breakfast is included in the price and is traditionally German - meats, cheeses and bread as well as cereal and yogurt. All very nice indeed! In the evenings, there is an honesty bar which contains beer, juice, soda and champagne! Other people have written that staying in Art Nouveau is like staying at a friends house, and I totally agree. The whole place is so welcoming and friendly - it really feels like home. Close to the hotel are some very nice restaurants. The whole area including the streets Bleibtreustra\u00dfe, Mommsenstra\u00dfe and Ku'damm have some really nice places to eat. We ate at Mey on Bleibtreustra\u00dfe - a Turkish restaurant. There is a big Turkish population in the city and you can get some really fine food. It was a really nice meal - lots of meat so vegetarians may want to give it a miss. We also ate in the 12 Apostles restaurant, a basic Italian restaurant that is famous for its pizzas named after the 12 apostles. This place is opposite the S-Bahn Station on Savignyplatz - but I reccommend you make a reservation, its very popular. Also near the station on Bleibtreustra\u00dfe is Ali Baba, a basic pizza and pasta restaurant that sells really nice slices. Its also very popular because its so cheap so get there early! Travellers Tips: If you fly into Berlin Schoenefeld airport (East Berlin) take the S-Bahn Train (S9) (S=Schnell B=Train) to Spandau and get off at Savignyplatz. The hotel is a 10 minute walk from this station. Alternatively, you can get off at Zoologischer Garten and get a Taxi to the hotel. Zoologischer Garten is one stop before Savignyplatz. The fare is 2,10 Euros. Get your tickets inside the airport or inside the station. Once you leave the main airport doors, the station is 400m across the road. Look out for a big green 'S'. Eating: There are lots of places to eat around Savignyplatz. Ali Baba, Mey, 12 Apostles, Lubtisch but they get very busy so I recommend you book. Trains: The public transport system is excellent in Berlin. The S-Bahn and U-Bahn run frequently over a 24 hour period. The closest train to Hotel Art Nouveau is Savignyplatz. People Watching: On our last day we spent the day in Scheunenviertel which means Barn Quarter. It was traditionally a Jewish area in Berlin and is in the 'Mitte' district. We took the U-Bahn (underground train) to Orienburgerstrasse and it brings you out right in the centre of the district. Here you will find numerous restaurants and bars. We drank in Studio 54 which is in an old warehouse that was used illegally for parties etc in late 1989 when the wall fell. We also ate in Da Da Falafel - a big hit with those on a tight budget and they were possibly the best Falafels I have ever eaten. Not far from here (30 min walk) is some pretty cool shopping outlets like Addidas Originals and Puma. Also there is the Hackescher Hof, a big shopping warehouse which is home to lots of different shops. Here you will find a shop dedicated to Ampelmann (Traffic light Men). The cool little red and green men can be found on just about anything from keyrings to T-shirts.

Everything else is, well, just a hodgepodge of disparate styles. We stayed in the \"suite\" called Peter for a week. It's the strangest suite I've been in. One enters through the kitchen and the fold-out bed/sitting room is in the kitchen as well. Looking at the floor plan in the breakfast room, I noticed that some of the regular rooms were larger than our suite. Also, if you stay in Peter, don't plan to sleep past 8:00 during the week. There is an elementary school next door and the kids raise quite a racket first thing in the morning. If 8:00 is your wake up time, no need for an alarm clock. Closing the double windows blocks out the noise pretty well, but then you lose the fresh air. The breakfast buffet is okay. I've had better and worse.

A good sized living room with wonderful chaise longue and modern bathroom and a bedroom to die for - all minimalistically furnished with a mix of classic antique and modern pieces , but with ample storage space and a stunning bed. Unlike many hotels, we were not pushed into the breakfast room before 9AM and on to the street by 10 by the cleaners - instead you could have breakfast any time up to 10:30 and the cleaning staff came to service the room when it was convenient for you to have it done! I'd recommend it to anyone looking to slow the pace of their trip down and relax into life in Berlin. With great local restaurants like Tavola Calda and the numerous options on offer in the bustling Savigny Platz and it's off-shoot streets only 10 minutes walk away, you are never far away from your brunch or evening meal! Another 15 minutes on the S-Bahn takes you to Hackescher Markt where your evening can really get into full swing. I'll be back in Berlin soon and I'll be back at Hotel Art Nouveau!!", "Date": "July 27, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "4.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Brooklyn, NY", "Title": "\u201cExcellent Value.

The owners are very friendly, helpful and generous. The breakfast room offers free coffee, tea and snacks 24/7, and an honor bar (reasonably priced). The only downside is no air conditioning, but heat waves are rare in Berlin. The rooms are comfortably but do vary in size and design, so it's better to request a specific room from their website.

After reading reviews, we made reservations at the Hotel Art Nouveau. Fifteen days before we were suppose to stay at the hotel, our plans changed, and my husband immediately called to cancel our reservations. The staff person (who later we believe was the Hotel Art Nouveau owner) said, Good! Thank you for calling and letting us know and we hope you will stay with us later. There was no discussion that we needed to follow-up with a written cancellation and we trusted all would be well.However, our next creditcard statement included a charge for $250 for both rooms we had reserved. We contacted the Hotel Art Noveau. The owner immediately told us we had no proof of ever calling. When we contacted the phone company and provided proof of a call on the date we had told him we had cancelled, he said that proving that we called did not provide proof that we had cancelled the rooms.The Hotel Art Nouveau owner also told us to look on their Web site and at the bottom of their emails where it says in small writing all cancellations must be written HOWEVER, while all other reservation information is in English and German, the written requirement is only in German at the very bottom of each screen not easy to find. When we pointed out this fact, the owner agreed it was misleading and said that he would no longer communicate with us about the charge.Our concern is how many non-German-speaking travelers have made reservations with the Hotel Art Noveau and then cancelled by phone only later to be charged for their rooms and then forced to pay ..... I warn all those who seek to stay at the Hotel Art Noveau to be extremely careful and not become victims to unscrupulous business practices.", "Date": "October 1, 2003"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "5.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "London, England", "Title": "\u201cHad a great time a the Art Nouveau\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR1275746", "Content": "We had a reakky good stay in this delightful family run hotel in a quiet and convenient part of Berlin.
