OK Jebel Ali is the last stop on the Metro, but its so cheap to get there, \u00a31.10 from the city, that it is'nt much of an issue. Takes about an hour to the city, but much less for the 'sights'. Rooms were adequate, particularly if you're the up and out type, and the beds were very comfortable. Like all easy facilities, you pay extra for the 'luxuries', for example room cleaning, towels changing etc so its up to you. Our additional bill came to 0, so you can see what we were like. All in all I would recommend it, only drawback being if you want a cab to anywhere back towards the city it starts off going the wrong way due to the motorway system and can be \u00a35-6 before you start going the right way. Use the Metro.", "Date": "January 30, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Dubai, United Arab Emirates", "Title": "\u201cBest value for money\u201d", "Author": "Rodeoankie", "ReviewID": "UR121754192", "Content": "Hi I stayed 2 nights at this hotel, and was on business, since our client was in Jebel Ali. I can simply say that if your needs are limited to spending a few nights in Dubai, and if your work is based in Jebel Ali area, then this is the best bet, unless you are a 4-5 star lover. Both the hotel & its rooms (including bathrooms) are very clean and well kept. The std. rooms are small, but, adequate to spend a night, the TV has 4 free channels (including Dubai one english movies channel). Bed is comfy, sheets/duvets are good. There's a safe and a study table as well. There's an in-house restaurant (Stefafano's) that serves very good and fresh food, and has a great affordable menu, and a very welcoming owner. There are vending machines as well for beverages and chocolates (2-3 AED). Internet is avlb for 10 AED/hour or 15 AED for 6 hours, with a validiity of 30 days, and 8mbps speed and available via wireless in many rooms, depending on the floor. Great benefit. The only negative is accessibility with city, unless you are ok to walk 700 meters to the metro station. Trying to go back to Dubai in a taxi can cost a fortune, as the taxi will go towards Abu Dhabi to take a U-turn which is 6-8 km ahead. So, better use metro. Would be good if the hotel could have a shuttle car at least to the metro stn. All in all, a good, no hassle experience. Will recommend to anyone who needs to spend less and live basic in dubai for upto a week.", "Date": "December 15, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Location": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Service": "4", "Rooms": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Paris, France", "Title": "\u201cBedbugs and more...\u201d", "Author": "Xebec S", "ReviewID": "UR118163852", "Content": "I returned this week to the easyhotel, as my initial stay in May was enjoyable and beyond expectations in terms of price and cleanliness.
