The hotel is about walking distance to main Orchard Street, about 10 minutes and 15 mins to nearest MRT station. With this said, for those who hates walking, the hotel offers frequent free shuttle buses to many must see places in Singapore which is a bonus for those who are on tight budget. The hotel is also connected to Tanglin Mall which is great as they have fast food court on lower grounds and supermarket. For a quick hunger fix, it's very convenient. The mall also had a few reputable cafe's and restaurants. Not to say that the hotel did not have good restaurants , we just ate out as that would have saved us money. We did however had breakfast with them and they had a good hot and cold selections which catered for all nationalities- well almost! My daughter and I took a cab from the airport which cost us around $28SGD-$30SGD. The hotel charges twice as much. You can also take the MRT from Orchard Station for less than $5 straight to the terminal or call one of the private serviced airport shuttle buses for $18SGD. The service we received from Traders was great. They were hospitable and amazingly surprising from what Singaporeans are known for.

The bed is on the firm side, but we did sleep well. Room noise was low. The walk to the main part of Orchard road was a bit far, but we did it many times, or took a taxi for $4.00 SGD.

The ability to come back in the evening have a drink, eat some quality snacks and just relax with a great view was something we looked forward to each day. We ate well outside each day so that a snack at night was enough. The club breakfast was so-so, we like a good breakfast to start our day in a strange place.

The amenities in the room are good, expect 'brown' wood decor which I think makes a small room look smaller, however we understand that they are under upgrade soon, personally I think they need it as the carpet was looking shabby. Swimming pool area is very nice, we did not have time to try the gym area. Rumpoles bar is small and quaint, expect dearer prices there. The first two nights on our floor there was a room on our level that appeared to have leaked water into the corridor and hence had that wet carpet smell. I was tempted to check out because of the smell however the staff operated to air out the corridors and rectified this problem well. Operating lifts were efficient and were quick, they had good indicators as to which lift you needed. Door men, check in/check out services were very efficient, staff were very helpful, and the lobby area looks amazing especially with the christmas and chinese new year decorations. As to location wise, taxis in Singapore are relatively inexpensive, there is a free shuttle bus to Orchard road which is easy to use. We went on the hippo buses to tour Singapore city and there is a convenient stop just outside the Traders Hotel across the walking bridge. If you stay at the Traders, you have the convenience of walking to the botanic gardens which is great, however you will need a shuttle bus to get to the Orchard MRT/Orchard road.

You can get to the hotel in various ways \u2013 you can take the MRT and walk from Orchard station but it will be a bit of a walk if you are dragging along a big suitcase. The best budget way is probably to take a bus that goes to Tomlinson road which is basically just around the corner from the hotel. We arrived at night after a long flight from Europe so we decided to just take a taxi to the hotel and that cost 30 Singapore dollar at night (prices will vary if it is during the busy period or not etc). Check in was fast and efficient and we got room 1513 on the 15th floor. The hotel was opened in 1995 and you can see that the hotel is starting to age a bit. The room we got was smaller than the rooms at e.g. Traders in Kuala Lumpur but I guess this is a general issue in Singapore. The room itself had a king-size bed with just one large duvet which worked out fine. The room was with light color wallpaper and a carpet on the floor. Due to the small room and the light walls you could see that people had bumped into the walls and left marks here and there. Apart from that there was room to put down one suitcase \u2013 the other one had to be placed on the floor. There was one chair but no table but there was also a desk and a chair. The desk included quite a lot of stationary and I don\u2019t think I have seen that before (stationary like scissors, yellow pen marker etc). The bed was quite comfortable and from the side it was possible to control the fan speed of the air con (but to control the temperature you had to use a knob on the wall) and the lighting in the room. There was a flat screen TV in front of the bed and some sort of strange \u201cart work\u201d hanging over it. The view from the room was to the pool on the 4th floor. There was also a mini bar behind a strange wooden door which sort of covered it \u2013 it contained just a few drinks but as we were staying on club level we could get free drinks in the club lounge all day. The wardrobe included some hangers and some drawers and the wardrobe also contained a small safe. The bathroom was really, really tiny \u2013 and with one sink, one toilet and one bathtub there was basically just room for one person in there. The bathtub had a shower option and a shower curtain prevented water from splashing everywhere. This is not my favorite shower solution but it worked. As at Traders in KL there was also a range of amenities ranging from shampoo, body wash to a comb, hair band etc. There was also a bit of smell in the bathroom \u2013 nothing really bad but maybe it was the smell of a damp shower curtain? We got several bottles of water each day complimentary but it is also possible to drink the tap water in Singapore. Internet is now free on all Shangri-La and Traders hotels and we did have to log in every day with room number and a password but it worked out pretty good even if we had several devices connected. The location of the hotel is not bad at all \u2013 located on Cuscaden road it is 650 meters from Orchard road. On Orchard road you have to walk another 400 meters to get to the Orachard SMRT subway station. But if you want to take the bus there are also bus stops nearby. There were always taxis around and they do run on meter. There is also a shuttle bus that takes guest to the Orchard road SMRT station every hour. We had breakfast in both the lounge and at Cafebiz (on the ground floor). The lounge is located on 17th floor and the breakfast here is not as lavish as in Cafebiz. In the lounge you can get some cereal, bread, a few hot dished, eggs made according to your wish etc. It provides a breakfast with a view in more a more quiet environment. The lounge is also the place where you can get afternoon tea or evening cocktails if you stay at Club level. The evening cocktails were served from 5.30 to 7.30 pm and also includes some snack food \u2013 but remember there is a lot of good food to eat in Singapore so don\u2019t eat too much in the lounge ;-) The girls in the lounge were helpful and nice but we didn\u2019t really use the facilities that much. The lounge seems to be in need of a bit of an upgrade \u2013 and how about replacing those uncomfortable chairs by the window ;-) The breakfast at Cafebiz is more lavish and typical for 4 and 5 star hotels in Asia. Here you have a wide selection of basically everything that you can imagine for breakfast and a bit more ;-) It is of course much bigger than the lounge and nosier. On the 4th floor there is a pool and it can be worth a visit if you want to cool down a bit as it is more or less always 30 degrees in Singapore. Right next to the pool is the gym and it contained new equipment it seemed like. There is also a spa connected to the hotel and a Swedish type massage for an hour cost about 100 Singapore dollar. Conclusion All in all I\u2019m quite happy with the stay at Traders hotel. At 330 Singapore dollar (250 USD) + taxes, the hotel room was quite expensive but Singapore hotels are expensive it seems like. The room was on the small side and the bathroom was really tiny \u2013 but at least we had access to a good breakfast and the option of evening cocktails. The service at the hotel is very good and the location is not bad at all \u2013 but it would have been better if it was a bit closer to the subway station. I wouldn\u2019t have any problems with recommending this hotel to friends and family.", "Date": "November 30, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Mumbai (Bombay), India", "Title": "\u201cLovely hotel and excellent service\u201d", "Author": "437Sarkar", "ReviewID": "UR121181739", "Content": "Newly renovated room with many channel to chose from TV.

My room however, although clean, was very small, and the furniture was old and outdated. The room was sufficiently small and the furniture and decor sufficiently drab that I actually found it slightly depressing while I was there. All in all, this hotel often represents great value - but it shouldn't be confused with most of the 4 and 5 star hotels in Singapore, because it is not on the same level. So, if you are budget conscious and it is available at a good rate, go ahead and book it - you won't be disappointed. If however the rate is on a par with other 4* and 5* hotels, as it sometimes is, then my recommendation would be to book another hotel. For example, both the Regent and the Orchard hotels are very close by and they are in a different class.

Hotel rooms - With the family, we usually take on the the Suite deals, which offer free berakfast, liunge access and a nice suite, so everyone fits in. The suites ar espacious, clean and offer the usual 5-star amneties.

I initially looked at booking us a cheaper hotel but as it was my partner's birthday thought we would upgrade to Traders. Prices were definitely not cheap but I had been to Traders in KL and thought it was worth the extra. I was very disappointed when I arrived. Pros: The location was fine, about 10 mins walk to Orchard road and the MRT. There's a good shopping centre next door with decent shops and coffee. Lobby was nice, plenty of cabs and we ate there twice and the food was good. Pool was fine, never too busy and plenty of sun beds. The room was always clean and the bed was king size. Cons: Room was very disappointing. We were on the 6th floor apparently looking out on to 'the garden,' which was in fact a bare strip of landing with a few pot plants, we were also looking straight out at a tower with a small view of the pool. When I booked, it said superior rooms were on higher floors (with views), but apparently this was only if you upgraded to their Traders Club at $88 (plus tax) a night. The room was tiny, literally room to walk around the bed and a small bay window, which was taken up by a desk. It's in desperate need of a makeover, very beige and brown. The bathroom was fine, but again tiny, you really couldn't have two people in there at once. Food and drinks are pricey at the hotel, to be expected I think though. (Head out and explore the shopping centre food courts, they were fantastic!! Really authentic. We particularly enjoyed Ion Mall). No decent bar area unless you have access to Traders club floors. (We loved the skybar at Marina Bay Sands, it's a must). If you're staying at this hotel (not in Traders Club) for anything but the location and for business, be prepared to be disappointed.

The hotel is towards the eastern end of Orchard Road and a short walk from some tremendous shopping opportunities (if that is what you are into!) and is connected to the small Tamblin Mall. Our room wasn't the biggest hotel room I have stayed in and I am sure that some guests, particularly from North America where, in my experience, hotel rooms are huge, might find them a touch 'cosy'. However, we work on the principle that you sleep in the room on holiday, no0t live in it so it was quite adequate. There were all the usual refinements and we had a view over the pool area. There is a pool which isn't ideal for swimming but is more of a leisure pool to relax in and around. Towels are available from the kiosk and there is poolside service. Breakfast is self service buffet but there is plenty to choose from and caters for western and oriental tastes. Eggs are made to order and the service was attentive but unobtrusive. We did have a late night snack in the Rumpole Bar and while the food and the service were fine, we did find the bar a little soulless with no international sports on the TV (I do like to follow the English premier League, much to my wife's disgust, while abroad!). The one area where the hotel excelled was its staff. I simply cannot fault them. Always friendly and willing to go that extra mile to please.

I arrived tired from a very short overnight flight so my tolerance level was at a low ebb. Check in was efficient, and I had pre-booked a non smoking room. When I walked in to it I could detect a stale tobacco smell and rang reception to ask for a change. They said they would send someone to freshen it up, which they did (almost immediately) so it then smelt a bit like air freshener! A day later, as I write this review, it still smells a bit old and smoky and musty, and I guess that's the point. It is a bit old and musty. The bathroom is a bit tired; the desk and furnishings are a bit worn. The hotel was built in 1995 (I think) and I wonder if there has been a major upgrade since? The location is arguable, and as you will discover when you ready the reviews, some people think it is fine; others don't. The fact is it is NOT as central as many other hotels in the area, but it is only just out of the zone. It really won't kill you to walk for an extra 10 minutes and it might help the calorie count! On the plus side, there's an iron/ironing board in every room AND there's even a washing matching/dryer facility on a few floors so you can launder your own gear if that's what you enjoy doing. The most positive experience, for me, was the pool and health club. I expect not everyone gets to use these facilities as I had them pretty much to myself....for three hours! There's a large outdoor pool, an excellent, modern steam/sauna/jacuzzi facility as well as a decent gym and a spa (I didn't use this). You can use everything (except the spa) and I encourage you to do so. For a hotel of this age and standard I was really surprised to find such a high quality facility. The restaurants are good and Rumpoles Bar is fun, though sadly you won't bump into Leo McKern. If you're on a budget there are heaps of other places nearby offering lower prices, as well as numerous supermarkets where you can buy wine, beer, sandwiches and pretty much anything else you might want.

Such a shame really, as this place - while it has many positives - is exactly as my title suggests. I have stayed in many fine hotels (many for a similar price) in SG, but this place does not deserve it's current status. I arrived in the wee small hours after an overnight flight, and no sleep for 36hrs. Foyer was pleasant, and the staff amenable. I had pre-arranged an early check in, yet I was informed (after I signed the check in documents) that I would be paying for two nights accommodation, not one. I have done this many times in the past, and not once have I been charged for the privilege. Not impressed so far. Wearily made it to my bedroom, having walked through a *very* smelly, smokey hallway - you see - they put me on a *smoking* floor! The bedroom was shocking. Absolutely tiny - there was barely enough room to swing a proverbial cat, see my photo. There's literally 30cm between the bed and the TV/minibar fridge unit. To be fair, after my complaints about the double charging, the duty manager called me and discussed - we came to an agreement to only charge half the normal rate. Still stinks, but hey, I'm not paying my expenses. The furniture in the room. The only redeeming feature was the supremely comfortable bed. The office chair was stained and well past it's best, stains on the carpet, a sink that wouldn't drain, and a room with a view to die for - wall to wall concrete. Multiple cigarette burns on the desk. Curtains that don't fully close. Ok, so enough negatives. Here's the positives: 1) The breakfast - perhaps among the top ten buffet breakfasts in Singapore 2) Amicable staff 3) Location - this hotel adjoins the Tanglin Mall, lots of good shopping, and is right on Orchard Road.

They offered us the upgrade as well but we thought it was a bit step price at $80 per day for breakfast and a cocktail, so we decided not to take this option. (There is a Starbucks down stairs and also a few bread talk places in the MRT you can get nice pasterys for around $3) We requested a non smoking room and on arrival at our room you could really smell the smoke. I rang reception and asked to be changed, and she said would you like house keeping to come and air it for you. I stated that this would not help the room as it was a extreemly strong smell and requested to be changed. After waiting 5 min in the room, we rang back down stairs as we did not know what was happening. They said someone was on their way up with a different key to a different room. We decided to wait outside for the new room key. About 20min later we had still not had anyone come up so, I decided to go back to reception. On arriving at reception there was no apology and a cold attitude for us wanting to change our room, along with no mention that we had already requested this. So we got a key to a room on the 7th floor. This was a slightly smaller room but clean enough. Well we thought, the toilet didn't work. We tried flushing this several times and with no avail back on the phone to reception again. We did not want to wait around for this to be fixed, and hoping that we did not have to change rooms again. So we went out and about and hoping that we would return to a room with a working toilet. We did, as it was fixed. The main thing was that we had no follow up from staff saying was everything ok, or no apology again. This really surprises me for a Shang Ri La hotel. The room was a bit old and dated, with old fittings, no flat screen tv and a really old air con turn dial (I am being picky but since we came from Bali which the accom was A+ I suppose it was a bit of a let down). In the hall way there was rips in the carpet etc... All in all it is not a bad hotel just dated, and their staff need to pay a bit more attention to the guests with problems.

Flying SQ, my wife and I decided to stay a few nights in Singapore, it being sale season. Knowing a bit of the lay of the land of Singapore, we took the 36 bus from Changi and got down at the Regent, which was a short walk to Traders. It had a couple of bus stops (Regent, where only the 36 airport stops, Aft Tomlinson Rd and Opp Traders Hotel) making easy getting around the city. It was also connected via bridge way to Tanglin Mall which proved to be very convenient for picking up some groceries and munchies. Upon check-in they did not have the room type I reserved (I booked a king and they only had a room with two single beds - so what's the point of making a reservation 2 months in advance?). Hotel was a little tired looking and room a bit dark. On more than one occasion, we were awakened by noise from next door and one can easily hear street noise. Thankfully, the property is on the quiet side of Orchard, so very few street traffic. Bathroom was minuscule, but water pressure and temperature were spot on good. There was a free and regular shuttle to and from various areas of interest. No need to book, just wait at the lobby, hop on the appropriate bus and hop off your destination. They also provided schedules of estimated pick up times. Very convenient! We took the Orchard Rd shuttle twice and saved on transport costs. Free wifi in room and in the lobby. Connection was fast and reliable. Did not avail of dining options in the hotel so could not comment on that. Check out was very efficient (Singapore style).

And there are bus stops accross the road - I would recommend to everyone going to Singapore to use their Public transport (although the taxis are really reasonable and very reliable) - you can get an Ez-link card and $10 will take you a long way - no need to walk long distances in the humidity and the rain, when buses can take you virtually everywhere.", "Date": "April 1, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Melbourne, Australia", "Title": "\u201cLovely Hotel\u201d", "Author": "KarenMcKay", "ReviewID": "UR101708935", "Content": "We stayed at the Traders Hotel with my daughters gymnastic team - each room had 1 adult and 1 teenager.

While the perks of the club level have been good the primary hotel functions have been below our standards. The room is very small and cramped. It would be ok for one person but for a couple with baggage it is very tight. Our room keys have failed three times and since we had to switch rooms during the stay it appears not to be a problem with just one door (Why swtich rooms - well becuse we landed late they had already given our reserved room to other customers the first night.) The televisions are old, which would not be a problem except they tend to get kind of frozen and loose the signal every 30 minutes or so. We have also found that housekeeping does not seem to keep a regular schedule on this level so it is difficult to know when to be in the room or away.

When I stayed with the family, I paid for a suite and we had a great experience. Most recently, when I traveled for work, there were a few things that let it down. When I arrived to check-in, they insisted that I have a smoking room and one with twin beds, neither of which were what I'd booked. I also am a member with the Golden Circle and wanted to put myself on the 'Trader's Floors' so I could have access to the lounge during the day. This was something they also said could not be accommodated. After a while, they managed to get me into a non-smoking room with a king bed and on the requested floor so it all ended up being ok. The major issue ended up being that they could not get me connected to the Internet and I spent over two hours waiting for various technicians to come and try and help me. The final outcome was no Internet in my room because I use a Mac and they did not know how to set it up. Despite my best efforts, I could not get it working either (but I've never had an issue elsewhere in the world). This was considerably frustrating as I really needed to be able to access email and Skype for work purposes. However, the 'Trader's Club Lounge' gave me this access, and although it was not private, it was good enough. Despite this slight setback, I had a good stay overall. The pool area is really lovely and gets full sunlight during the day hence making the water nice and warm. The gym is a pretty decent one and was enjoyable to work out in. The staff were what I'd expect for a Shangri La or Trader's Hotel - very professional and mostly helpful. The food was excellent as usual.

The strange thing was that you have to use the shower room which is located inside the spa - very nice for swimmers as you walk through a pleasant lobby, but perhaps not so nice for spa users? The reception staff were also very helpful - we were only supposed to stay 2 nights, but decided to extend it for a 3rd day (as is happened to be our wedding anniversary) - one of them spent some time talking to my husband and giving him tips as to what to do to make the day special. The hotel is around the Orchard Road shopping area, about a 10 -15minute walk to one end of it - if you plan to walk the whole length, then you end up quite far from the hotel and may need to get a cab back The only negative point would be that the lobby is really small - there's no space to sit and relax there, as it was always bustling with people checking in and out.", "Date": "December 24, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "London", "Title": "\u201cSmall rooms but great service and excellent location\u201d", "Author": "CaraKiwi", "ReviewID": "UR89658135", "Content": "Me and Partner really enjoyed our stay the Traders Hotel, Singapore.

Check-in was quick, efficient and very courteous. Our room on the 12th floor faced the rear of the building overlooking the swimming pool and this is recommended as it is quieter than rooms to the front. The bedroom had an excellent Queensize bed with a firm mattress which I prefer. Internet is provided by both network cable in the bedroom and wifi in the lobby. Both are free. The bathroom, although a little on the small side, is well equipped, clean and stocked with a good variety of toiletries. Bed linen was changed daily which is a nice touch. Breakfast variety is excellent and quality was good, with various influences available including Eastern and the more traditional Western fare. The surroundings convenient to the lobby where breakfast is served were very clean and the staff pleasant and helpful. We got a deal which included breakfast and airport transfers. If you haven\u2019t got breakfast in the deal, it will cost $34 each to eat in Traders. Cheaper options are available in the Tanglin Mall which is attached to, and to the rear of, the hotel. The swimming pool and leisure areas were clean, very functional and a welcome diversion from the warm, balmy weather during our stay. By turning right out of the hotel and going over the pedestrian walkway, one can access the open-top hop-on/hop-off bus tours which pass by every 30 minutes or so. This is only about 50m from the hotel. Prices vary from S$18 to S$33 depending on which package you choose. For getting around, the underground Metro system (the MRT) is very good. Be advised that the nearest MRT stop in Orchard Road is a good 12-15 minutes\u2019 walk. A two-day unlimited tourist pass cost us S$26 each, with $10 refunded upon return of the card after use. In summary, this is a very good hotel which I can thoroughly recommend. It is a little way from the harbour and old colonnial areas, but if you use the MRT and hop on/off buses constructively, all areas of this wonderful city are accessible.", "Date": "December 12, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Alnwick, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cGood location, nice hotel\u201d", "Author": "boydsmad", "ReviewID": "UR88767545", "Content": "Good location for the hotel - walkway through to Tanglin Mall, 10-15 mins stroll to Orchard Road amd 10mins to the Botanical & Orchid Gardens.

We were offered an extra bed, however there really wasnt any room for an extra bed in the lounge or the bedroom and when it turned up it was a single camp bed. As mum and I are close we didnt mind sharing the king sized bed. However, if we had minded there was no twin room for us even though that is what we had booked. One of us would have been on the very comfy king size and one of us would have been on the single fold up camp bed! This aside it was a very comfortable stay. We had the buffet dinner in the restaurant one night which was extensive and good value, breakfast in the Traders Club is limited in hot options but was fine for us. For people who want more hot options they can choose breakfast in the restaurant instead at no extra cost. The nibbles and drinks (wine/beer/standard spirits) in the club in the evening were great, even though we only got back in time to go on one of our 3 nights.

There were a lot of people by the front desk, and while there were about 5 people manning it, the queu was about 3 people per. I waited about 10 minutes before my turn. I booked through hotels.com and specifically requested for a king bed and a room that is far from the elevator. After a busy work week, I felt I deserved a quiet stay for the weekend. The front desk clerk ( a young man, who by the way looked bored to death with what he was doing)advised me upon check in that they only have 2 single beds put together located far from the elevator and that their king room is near one. I said I will choose the room far from the elevator. The bell hop and I went upstairs and after seeing the bed, which to me looked quite uncomfortable, I decided to go down again and request for another room. I lined up again and this time, a lady (unfortunately, I forgot to get her name), assisted me. I told her about my request and she said, they do have a king room and it is far from the elevator! She reassigned my card key and up I went to my new room which had a fantastic view and is really far from the elevator, which I loved! Breakfast was fantastic, loved the selections. The internet was fast and did its purpose. The bed was comfortable. Toiletries were provided and service was prompt during certain occasions when I asked for additional towels. Check out was quick.

Location - This hotel is strategically located not too far away from the hustle and bustle of Orchard Road, in a quiet obviously high class residential area with luxury apartments and a number of hotels. Approximately 10 minutes walk down to Orchard Rd, and not too far away from the Botanical Garden. The hotel also provides a very efficient shuttle service plying to and fro from hotel to city centre, including its sister property, the Shangri-La Singapore. It was also fairly easy to get taxis from the hotel's driveway. The hotel is also linked to the Tanglin Mall which is more of a family oriented mall, with sufficient outlets for us business travellers who needs a breather from our schedule and refuse to join the crowd in Orchard Rd. Some nice restaurants there and a well stocked Supermarket that caters to expatriates. Service - Service was indeed good - a team of ever helpful staff and always with a pleasant smile. Nothing seemed impossible for them, even when it was obvious that they were facing a busy day due to high arrivals and departures. Room service and other requests were prompt and the housekeeping in the room was good too! Unfortunately due to hectic schedule, did not get to use other facilities, but did manage to peek into their club lounge, fitness centre and a look at their pool. The free internet in the room was also very good and speedy! (Requested for extended broadband cables, however this was not available - good to bring your own if you like to use your laptop in bed..) Room - Have read several reviews mentioning the room was small, but personally I found it cosy and just nice.

The hotel offers a free shuttle pick up and drop off to the Wisma Atria mall which is attached to the Orchard MRT. However the wait was horrible! The lobby looked decent.

To make matter worse, our room was SWELTERING HOT. Apparently when there is no activity they turned off all ac and lights, and that made the room smelled even more MUSTY.You can imagine yourself in the sultry July weather in Singapore. We had to slide our key into the slot for the AC and lights to work. So we had to wait for at least 30 minutes before we can feel the AC. So we escaped right away. When we returned the room was only slightly cooler. the AC did not work fully. It was not cold at all, in fact I was sweating. And not to MENTION THE TV!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! It was that horrible THICK TUBE TV you barely see no more in a hotel that positions themselves in the SGD 250/night category. What was I paying for???

There is a taxi stand at the front of the mall that always has taxis waiting. Having the mall attached to the hotel is a huge plus. It is not really a mall in western point of view, no department stores here - it's small and charming with a good selection of small boutiques, 3 toy stores!, a lovely supermarket, health food store, pharmacy, food hall and cafes. The cafe on the same floor as the entrance to the hotel is a great alternative to eating at the hotel. The food in the hotel is awful, breakfast is particularly bad. Even though it is a big buffer spread, food is unattractive and not tasty, coffee is awful. I would not pay for the hotel breakfast (30 sing dollars per person), mine came with the room rate, but I went only twice. I would whole heartedly recommend this hotel to people planning to use it as a base to sleep in, to those who do not plan to relax much in the hotel itself, as it is reasonably priced and is in a good location. A word of advice to families traveling with children: hotel rooms are so small that fitting a baby crib will be a challenge, a roll away bed for an older child is impossible.

But at night walking wasn\u2019t bad, and felt safe too since the streets are well lit (I walked back around 11 pm every night). I would have taken a taxi at night too (because I was tired), but taxis were few and far between at that time from Orchard Road MRT/ION mall area. There is a Starbucks and mall next door (Tanglin Mall), not a great mall but very convenient, with pharmacy, money changer etc. The money changer gives pretty good rate too, almost on par with what you would get at Mustafa (the best rate I found in Singapore). I took airport shuttle service (not provided by the hotel) to get to the hotel which was cheap (S$9) and efficient. Couldn\u2019t get it when going back to the airport so took taxi which was 3 times more expensive (s$27).

It provides great service, great (albeit small) rooms, good (though not great) location, and some very good rates, without all the marketing hype that you commonly see with other hotels of its stance. This hotel is of great value without much sacrifices to quality and should be considered for all from budget travellers to execs. The hotel may not have the impressive grandeur gates or the marble lobby areas. In fact, the lobby at the Traders is often lined with trolley bags that the concierge is looking after for its horde of guests (many of them on package tours). The bustling lobby stretches into the restaurant sitauted right in front of the front desk where you will often see people lining up to 10m to grab seats for breakfast (in the morning). It is one of the busiest hotels and for a good reason. Hence, if you prefer serenity and personalized service, look elsewhere. The hotel's popularity leads to its few (minor) kinks. The staff are hard working but are unable to be 'warm' as they need to quickly move onto the next task without time to 'connect' with guests. An example of this is at the breakfast area. The staff have (obviously) been trained to fold up the napkins and place them on the seats while the occupying guest is out collecting food. They would do this so quickly and professionally that they would go from table to table like robots folding and placing napkins on a frenzy. I applaud their enthusiasm but sometimes it's more about connecting than getting things ticked and out of the way. Such was witnessed across the hotel. Because the staff are busy, they are less attentive (not unfriendly, just less attentive). Minus this minor wrinkle, everything else was satisfying. The beds are very comfortable and the TVs are new. The room is on the smaller side but provides all the necessities to get your work done and unwind. They provide free stationary as well as descent bathing amenities. Requests are met quickly (i.e. extra towels, empty mini bar etc) and done by a professionally trained group of staff. Bathroom is a bit small (no separate shower) but is nothing short of a descent 5 star bathroom. The water pressure is top class. In terms of location, it is a fair bit away from the main Orchard road. This can both be a positive and a negative. For those that would like to be close to action but not in the middle of it, this would be a great spot (it is in the same neighborhood as the St. Regis and the Regent Hotel). For those that wish to have everything laid out on the doorstep, Traders might be a bit too far (no MRT stations nearby either). It is very close to the British, Australian and the American embassies, however. Breakfast spread is very descent and the taste is of high standards. Check-in and Check-out staff were very professional, greeting each guest and taking the time to speak to them regardless of how busy they are. I did not get to use all the facilities (club lounge, swimming pool, gym etc) but judging from the way that the rest of the hotel was kept, I have no doubt that they are maintained extremely well. A hotel of this class would typically be a 3 or a 4 out of 5 depending on the price and its perceived glamor. For Traders, however, with its understated nature, its attention to service level than crystal chandeliers and its low price tag, it deserves a 5. Nowhere else can you get this level of service at same amount. NB. The closest way to get to the Orchard MRT from the hotel lobby is to turn LEFT. The tempation is to turn right onto the main Tanglin Mall and to walk around via the big Orchard Road, but don't. Turn left and walk down the little lane until you reach the end. From there you can turn right to reach the MRT station relatively quickly.", "Date": "March 17, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Wembley, Western Australia", "Title": "\u201cFine, affordable hotel\u201d", "Author": "ABSViews", "ReviewID": "UR58771128", "Content": "We arrived quite late at night and were upgraded from a king bedroom to a suite which was a lovely start to our stay.

The gym and health club offers massage, with complimentary jacuzzi, sauna etc. I will definitely be booking here again. I reckon it is good value.

The location is 10' walk from the closest MRT station (Orchad) and 5' from Orchad road.

Probably four and a half. It's features outweigh a few minor inconveniences. Overall, it's a nice relaxing place to stay in Singapore - and a good hub to explore Singapore from. The staff were all friendly and helpful, they took our luggage up and down and the nearby Tanglin mall was excellent. Positives: + The supermarket and cafes nearby in Tanglin mall were as good as supermarket you find anywhere else in the world. It has everything. In addition, there's a food court down there with a wide variety of foods and also a cafe, where we saw many people have breakfast in the morning. Coffee, eggs, toast all appeared to be available. You don't need to go outside, you go to Level 2, and there is a walkway from there to the mall. You can get everything like milk, cereal, salad ingredients, meats etc. A real bonus. + We loved the pool. It's generously sized and fun to swim in. We saw many people enjoy those facilities. Close by, the gym looks to have all sorts of equipment and the change rooms have a spa and sauna inside. There is also a hospitality room which we took advantage of since there was a gap in time between our check out and our flight in the evening. + They provide a shuttle bus, which goes between the hotel and Orchard MRT station. Take careful note as to the nearby shops to the drop off point. There is a Nike shop and Wisma Atria. When coming out of the MRT, look to exit out of the side where there is a 7-11 shop ~ not the side where there is a shop called Bobbi Brown. + Great location for the botanical gardens. + Room is very neat and clean, very well looked after, excellent room service. Negatives: - While it's only about 10~15 minutes walk to Orchard MRT, that walk in the Singapore heat and humidity can be a bit exhausting. As mentioned, take note of the shuttle bus times, which run every hour. On the upside, once you get to Orchard MRT, during non-peak times, getting to the hotel shouldn't cost you more than $5 SGD, in peak times, it shouldn't be more than $10 SGD. We used taxis here or there to save us from walking in the heat. In the evening, it can be a pleasant walk back to the hotel. - While they provided LAN internet access, we couldn't get this to work. However, there were a few wireless networks provided by the hotel and while we got very low signal in our room, it did the job for us. The wireless in the hotel lobby works well. So we didn't really chase up the problem too much. Initially we thought we might get to this hotel by using the MRT, and that might be ok for a single traveller with little luggage. However, the transport from the airport to the hotel only costs $9 SGD per head and it's a nice ride in. It wouldn't be that fun swapping at City hall with a few luggage bags. Perhaps if you're travelling with more than 2 people it's a better option to taxi it in. On the whole, we enjoyed our stay in Traders. Perhaps next time, we might consider staying in a location closer to an MRT station and that too one of the interchange stations such as City Hall and Dhoby Gaut. However, we would be comfortable at traders too, since now we know that the supermarket is nearby. Singapore is a great place to visit, neat, clean, easy to get around - so many food options.

Once in, they took charge and checked us in. Room was nice and they welcomed us with complementary strawberries. Next day ALL the towels were missing, no shower cap, and none of the toiletries replaced. Amazing! To top it, there was a bill of cup noodles from mini bar which we had not used. I called reception and they reverted the charges & replaced towels. The hotel shuttle to Orchard road was a small mini bus which gets full and hotel staff advises you to take a walk.

We were given a room that smelt very smokey, so we called reception and were given another room within 15 mins - very impressed. No trouble at all. This hotel is never going to delight you as much as the Orchard Shangri-la would but for it's price, it's a great bet for somewhere clean, modern and adequate when you're not going to be spending a great deal of time in your hotel room! The pool is great - really big and open with a lovely lounger sun-trap area surrounding it. Hotel bar isn't anything to write home about but there are plenty of bars near Orchard. Sampled the food which was fine and price not too bad. Singapore is terribly expensive any currently due to their currency strength and the UK's currency weakness! That's life! 10 mins walk to the TOP end of Orchard road and I'd say about 20 mins to the Orchard MRT. Felt perfectly safe to be walking back to the hotel late at night. It's gonna take you about 30 mins to get to Clarke Quay via the MRT and about 10 mins by taxi to Chimes for example. I'd say an hour start to finish to get to Sentosa. One other thing .... I left my camera memory cards in the hotel room safe only to discover my error when safely back in the UK.

We stayed ont he Trader's Club Floor. (Room 1732). The room was nice, but there were a few drawbacks to the room, upon entering the room, the closet stuck out from the wall about 6 inches. so you had to avoid hitting your shoulder on it weach time you entered the room. Also there was an armoir holding the Television, which was not a flat panel but a standard Box one. This limited the space to walk past the bed to the desk to less than half a meter between the bed and TV. Had they installed a Flat Panel on the wall, this would have increased the room size dramatically. Also the mini-bar ws over-priced even for Singapore (about 5 sing dollars for a can of soda??) The extra cost of staying on the Trader's floor (45 Sing Dollars USD) was well worth it, for the benefit of the Cocktail and Canape hour, held every evening from 530-730 pm). The Breakfast served in the Trader's Club lounge was also excellent. The only missing item was \"made-to-order\" eggs. Otherwise the peace and quiet that was had there as opposed to the general dining area in the Lobby was perfect. I thought we were to receive a daily newspaper, but never did get one, nor did the offer come through to press my husbands suit upon arrival. The bathroom was adequately stocked, but was very small, you had little room to move in it, maybe 1 sq meter between the commode, sink and tub.

I must say i was rather disappointed with their service, especially since I chose to stay in the Traders Club, which was advertised as to have \"a higher standard of accommodation, personalised service and a host of special privileges and amenities\" for the frequent traveler (quote from their website). The hotel appeared aged but rooms--smaller than expected--were generally well kept up; location not central on Orchard road but fit my purpose. To make a long story short, on Day2 of my 4D stay, my room had a leak that was not fixable and I had to move--not once but 3 times (I forget!) since I had some specific requests--THAT'S why I chose the more expensive Traders Club rooms instead of one of their regular rooms!! So after spending about 1-2h repacking and moving around and re-unpacking, you would think that the hotel would be bending over backwards to apologize for this. Yes, I did get a phone call from the manager to apologize for the inconvenience, but that was IT.... Nothing special or 'personalized' about the service!! To be fair, the quality of the food (bkft & evening cocktails) was quite good, but the service was definitely disappointing, especially given that this was Traders Club, especially given that this was Singapore, service city of the world as they like to think.

Previously, we had considered Traders a higher-priced hotel for business travelers at the extreme end of Orchard Road, but in late July, it offered the best value compared with other Orchard Road hotels: a discount for advance payment and a rate that included free broadband access but no breakfast (there are so many low-priced breakfast options in Singapore). Most of our shopping was at the Orchard Road area near Somerset MRT station, and connection to Somerset by bus was easy on buses 111, 123, and 174. On the return trip by bus, 111, 123, and 174 will drop you on Grange Road right across the street from the Traders. We were in room 1108 with a good view of the pool and the Shangri-la Hotel on the horizon. We were impressed with the little details in the comparatively small but efficient room and bathroom. We had 4 large suitcases and carry-on bags, and we stored them in the room without problem. There are small glowing lights on the switches that turn on night-lights under each bedside table so you can find them in the dark. There is an area in the center of the mirror in bathroom that is mist-free. There is a bedside clock that lights up when you hold it (amazing that no one tries to steal it). There is a refrigerator but no freezer, but we left our ice packs at reception, and they were brought to us fully frozen when we checked out. There were no noises in the hall or from neighbors even though the neighboring rooms were occupied. Floors and ceilings don\u2019t transmit sound. The TV was inside of a wooden cabinet that seems to direct sound to the bed. When one arrives at the bank of lifts, one lift usually is open and waiting to receive riders. Tanglin Mall includes a food court and supermarket in the basement, and it is connected to Traders by a pedestrian bridge that is open from 10 am to 10 pm, but you can enter the mall by other routes before 10. The free broadband connection had reasonable speed, and it was always reliable. The cable outlet was on the writing desk facing the window, and two electrical outlets were available on the side of the desk. There is a flashlight in the nightstand. The cable TV channels included HBO. It is possible to control both the wind and temperature, but we had a bit of a problem making the room frigid enough so we could sleep under the rather heavy single blanket that was wrapped in a sheet. When we checked in, the reception desk gave us permission to check out two hours late on our check-out day. There seemed to be a roaming supervisor around the reception desk who helps people when all stations are serving guests. We noticed that rooms were being cleaned in the late afternoon and that most requests were handled by the operator instead of by individual departments such as housekeeping. Checking in and out was fast and easy. We did not use business facilities, fitness center, restaurants, or the pool, but we found that Traders was an excellent value for shopping and tranquility for recovering from jetlag after a long flight across the Pacific.", "Date": "August 2, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Los Angeles, California", "Title": "\u201cAN EXCELLENT PRIZE\u201d", "Author": "CCMom123", "ReviewID": "UR36072464", "Content": "We stayed at Traders Hotel Singapore as part of a prize won on \"The Price is Right.\" The staff was consistently very welcoming and friendly.

We saved a fortune doing this as we didn't thne have to eat out in the evening and pay out for a meal for 3 everynight. The canopes were superb and the choice of drinks really good. Good location and only a 10 minute stroll to Orchard Road MRT. All the staff were really nice and check in and check out was smooth and painless. Swimming pool and gym facilities were also good and the room was really clean and comfortable. The breakfast is probaly the best i've seen for choice, just incredible. I cannot praise this hotel highly enough and i would definately stay here again if i were visiting Singapore.

Taxi's aren't expensive so if time is not on your side, grab one but be warned it is very hard to find one when it rains, as they get pre-booked. When I visited Singapore 10 years ago I found it very expensive and I was on my first salary, this time compared to London prices I didn't think it was too bad, food prices are different depending where you go, wine is very expensive, can be \u00a350 a bottle, though beer etc isn't too bad. Things to try, the Singapore flyer is great, Botanic Gardens are beautiful and go to the Orchard house. Try the Jurong Bird park, it\u2019s a bit out of the centre but worth the travel, China town is great day or night for eating or buying things to take home. The keys are nice, Boat Quay is the best, Clarke key is very different to before now very modern with just bars.

If you want to try a great shop for silks and dressing gowns etc, go to TANGLIN SILK STORE, Tanglin Shopping Centre, 19 Tanglin Road.

If you are walking, the nearest MRT is Orchard and will take you 20 mins walk to get there (quite a reasonable pace). If you don't want to walk, you can take a taxi (but bear in mind Orchard Rd is a one way street so if you are catching a taxi back to the hotel, you have to go to the next street parallel to Orchard). One tip is to print out a bus map, there are several bus stops around the hotel and it is much better taking the bus than the MRT. The bus system is not very clear and even the locals don't really know what to catch but there should be a bus map on the website which is a very valuable tool in knowing what bus goes where. I only found this out on the last couple of days of my trip and if I had to do it all over again, buses are definitely the way to go. But be sure to pick up an ezlink card so you don't have to fiddle for the correct change for the fare. Location is a bit out of the way but still okay if you leverage the buses. Bus #36 (bus stop in from of Regents Hotel which is next door) takes you to the airport (costs $1.90). If you have one suit case this should be OK as the bus should be quite empty at this pickup point. Bus #190 (bus stop across the road from hotel) takes you to Bugis, Bus #7 (bus stop across from Tanglin mall) takes you to Chinatown. Practically any bus will take you down Orchard Road (its quite a long strip) and to city hall. The singapore tourist board is across the road from the hotel so you can drop by and ask for information. If you catch the MRT, on weekends, there is a free shuttle from Douby Gought (?) to Chinatown and Little India.You can alight at city hall and there is a free shuttle to Suntec Mall and Central point shopping centre. The reception is quite unhelpful... they don't go out of their way to assist you and to some extent they just point you to ask their colleague rather than find out for you which I expect from a 4 star hotel.

(usually fine chocolates, cake, samosas, spring rolls, fruit/ veges and dip and biscuits but varies by the day) Another bonus is free internet, business services, daily newspapers and breakfasts during your stay. Breakfast at the hotel is fairly expensive if you don't go for a club suite, but the food is excellent. It's an international menu with anything you could hope for served. Otherwise this hotel is next to Tanglin mall which has a McDonalds and other cafes and a food court downstairs- there you can also get great food. The rooms were a decent size, very clean and contained every toiletry you could want. The pool was large and great for a swim. The hotel also has gym and beauty spa facilities.

(about a 5 minute walk) However we opted for the SIA hop on/hop off service which leaves every 30 mins from directly across the the road- about 30 metres away.

We'd booked our room through Travelbag, but weren't wildly impressed. First of all, the hotel is right on the very outskirts of the central shopping district/end of Orchard Road, and not as central as we'd been led to believe. Its proximity to the beautiful Botanic Gardens was a lovely surprise however - well worth a visit even in the humidity. The hotel seemed very pleasant on arrival with an attractive reception area, and we couldn't fault the service - welcoming, helpful and accommodating. Although we'd arrived on an early morning flight, our room was immediately available to us, and housekeeping promptly provided a travelcot for our 20-month old son. However, the room was really very cramped - it would have been a tight squeeze just for the 2 of us, but with an active toddler added in to the mix, it was just far too small. The bathroom in particular was almost ridiculously compact. The outdoor pool was a definite plus, as a way to revive ourselves after a long flight. Rather than breakfasting in the hotel, we ventured the very short distance to Tanglin Mall, just outside the hotel's back entrance (door to mall is by the lifts) and had a great brunch at Oomphatico's restaurant. On the day of departure we had an expensive but very delicious snack from the hotel's ground floor bar/restaurant before we left, although we would have had a much better value meal in the basement level food court in Tanglin Mall, but we didn't discover this until too late. We took the opportunity to do the Night Safari, but the tour operator suggested by the concierge, Luxury Tours, had a long and complicated transfer service which meant that we spent more time in transit than at the zoo itself (our time there was also curtailed by the need of some of the group to return for outward flights, but this wasn't pre-warned). Overall, there was nothing actually wrong with the Traders Hotel, but because of the lack of space in the room, it was no more than adequate for our needs, and we hope for a better experience at a different hotel booked for our return journey.", "Date": "October 29, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "3", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Brisbane", "Title": "\u201cAffordable accommodation in leafy, pleasant location\u201d", "Author": "pragasam", "ReviewID": "UR21087956", "Content": "We booked through Creative Holidays (stay 4 nights, pay for 3 deal, with 4pm check-out on day of departure).

It was well appointed but smallish, as others have mentioned, but not out of the ordinary for high priced real estate cities. Our room was clean and well serviced by housekeeping. The bed was one of the most comfortable I've ever slept in. Our room was at the end of the corridor and quite quiet. The food at the breakfast buffet was excellent as was the room service spaghetti and meat balls that we ordered for our toddler. The hotel is connected to a good mall with an excellent grocery store in the basement. We found it very convenient to the Gleneagles Hospital complex, to which we were able to walk. We were just around the corner from Orchard Road but off the beaten path enough that we didn't have any traffic noise. All the staff we encountered were courteous, friendly, and efficient (even when they were delivering some most unwelcome news, described below). The free Wi-Fi in the common areas of the hotel was speedy and reliable. Our one sour note was on check-out. On arrival, the front desk clerk told us that breakfast was included. Our reservation had not made any mention of this added bonus, so we were pleasantly surprised. On check-out however, the same clerk informed that our wonderful buffet breakfasts were not, in fact, complimentary but S$138 for two people for two days. She claimed she had never told us the buffet was complimentary. The hotel management responded to my email of concern quickly but have been slow in rectifying the problem. In the end they gave one of us a 50% credit for the breakfast charges, so their error--which I'm sure was an innocent mistake--ended up costing us S$69.

Tanglin Mall next door is currently doing some work, not really sure what, but ..... they begin work aroungt 6pm and finish around 7pm. If you are in a pool facing room on a lower floor (as were my parents - room 709) the noise is not condusive to relaxation. What is worse is the noise around the pool. It is at time unbearable and if swimming underwater you can actually feel the vibrations of the building work going on a few meteres away - see picture. In addition during our stay the sauna steam room and jaccuzzi was out of action due to refurbishment - though this should be completed now. We complained to the hotel management who offered us a basket of fruit by way of apology for our inconvenience. We acknowleded the gesture but suggested someting a tad more expansive on their part would be more in order! The girl we spoke to was at a loss so we suggested maybe being allowed to access the executive floor anf the executive longe and all its attributes. SDhe said she would have a word with her supervisor. This took two of our five days to accomplish, but finally we were given permission to do this. The hotel did say as they had received so many complaints guests were allowed to use the facilities at the Shangri La, but that is not next door!!!! If you are considering using this hotel and its pool area over the next couple of month's, I really would reconsider. If on the other hand its just a base to explore Singapore,m go ahead and book but make sure you don't get a pool facing room on a lower floor. Otherwise, I'd have no hesitation recommending this hotel.

It's a short walk away from the lovely Botanical Gardens, and the hotel provides a local jogging map - great for stretching legs and refreshing eyes after a long-haul flight. Hotel staff were uniformly polite and helpful, and the room service meal I ordered was delicious and well-presented, with a fresh orchid spray. It's true the room was not enormous, but it was very comfortably and stylishly appointed, with decent quality toiletries in the bathroom, fluffy robes and waffle slippers, and an enormous television. The hotel's outdoor pool area was also attractive, not super-luxe perhaps, but perfectly adequate. I second the previous comments about the breakfast buffet - it is outstanding, particularly the selection of tropical fresh fruits. Easy walking distance from the Singapore metro station on Orchard Road. There really was nothing I didn't like!
