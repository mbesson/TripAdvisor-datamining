Full marks on that. The area is quite busy, as you'd expect--but the hotel is situated in a somewhat quiet corner--and that was indeed a pleasant surprise.The rooms are spacious (which is a treat in Paris, also a tad expensive) and in particular, the housekeeping and the concierge are very helpful. The gym located right in the centre of the hotel was, also, I thought a good idea. But I needed to check out a bit early in the morning at about 6.30 a.m. to catch a connecting Air France coach to CDG airport --which stops very close to the hotel, too. I was told the previous evening that I could ask for a parcelled breakfast to be provided. I did call up both reception and the breakfast guys to make my request. All seemed fine till the next morning--when during check-out I was told that all they could provide me was some coffee & biscuits. Breakfast started at 6.30 a.m., so it should not have been too much trouble ( given my request the evening before) to provide me something a bit more. The staff speak good English, so communicating is not a problem either and most of the front office staff are helpful too.", "Date": "April 6, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Sleep Quality": "2", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "chester", "Title": "\u201cFalsely advertised - no air con\u201d", "Author": "lynda82012", "ReviewID": "UR126904745", "Content": "We've just returned from a 3 night stay at the above hotel in March 2012. It was an unusually hot period of weather and on reaching the hotel lobby we were overcome by how warm it was inside - but were impressed by the lobby area. The first part of our problems was at check in. We arrived shortly after noon. We were advised that the room was in the process of being cleaned and would be available in 30 minutes. Since we didn't deem that too much of an issue we waited as we wanted to get changed etc (we were impressed with the 2 free Macs on offer to surf the web during this time). The internet was free but you had to log in every 20 minutes to release some more time. We used 2 lots of 20 minutes and went to check back in. We were advised that the room was ready but needed to be checked. We were told that would take 5 minutes and he would come back to us. After waiting another 15 minutes we went back and were told the staff still had not checked the room and there were a few frantic phone calls to the chambermaids. We were finally checked in 1hr and 20 minutes after arriving! No drinks etc were offered. Had they told us it was going to take that long we would have left our bags and not wasted our time. We were not impressed by this service and nor the heat of the bedroom (4th floor) on arrival. We quickly changed, turned the \"air con\" on and closed the curtains to deflect the sunlight. On our return at ~ 11pm the room was unbearably hot. Due to the long day of travelling we went to bed but had to open the window to Paris' noise. The bed had a thick duvet on too. The \"air con\" was non existent. On Sunday we had room service which we couldn't fault (although it was just cereal, yoghurt and croissants + drink, no option for cooked breakfast or preference to cereal / yoghurt flavours). On leaving the hotel that morning we complained about the air con to the front desk. They advised that they had no air-con! When we said it was on their website (and is still on their website) they said we were mistaken. They do not have air con. They advised that a fan would be delivered and I asked for thinner bed sheets. On our return that evening we noticed they had shut the window in the room but had supplied a fan that was very ineffective (the temperature in the room was in excessive of 20 degrees even in the evening). The \"bed sheet\" supplied was a blue fleece blanket that still had 4 safety pins in it from housekeeping and did not fit the kingsize bed. On Monday we were out to Disneyland and went down for breakfast at ~8am. We were shown to a table, and on getting up to get provisions, someone else was shown to \"our\" table. I then asked for another and was directed to another table - on getting there I noticed a pair of glasses so someone else was sitting there. On going back to the waitress we were shown our 3rd table, but again whilst we were up another couple were sat there. In the end we picked a random table as we had nothing to leave behind on the table to acknowledge we were sat there. Why this 4* hotel does not use a \"reserved\" tab or another means of allocating tables is beyond me. We also had to ask for coffee which took 10 minutes to arrive. We were severely displeased with this service and would not recommend the hotel breakfast. I reported the continuing issue of the hotel temperature quickly before leaving Monday morning and was told that there was nothing more they could do. We arrived back Monday evening approx. midnight and thankfully the room temperature was slightly better - this was down to the weather and nothing to do with the hotel services. Tuesday morning we booked breakfast for the room due to the problems experienced the day before. This breakfast was not to the same standards as Sunday - the mixed fruit selection was only pineapple and fewer croissants. We checked out Tuesday - and it was rather business like. There was no personal touch asking about our stay, it was simply \"have you used the mini-bar\" and \"goodbye\". For a 4* hotel I would have expected so much better. The room was rather tired looking (I believe other rooms were renovated from other reviews), no air con, 1 hour 20 mins to check in (when other guests were checking in fine) and also on 3 occasions we saw staff smoking right outside the main entrance - certainly not a nice look, especially when 1 was a chef in his whites. Overall very poor. I would not recommend this hotel to anyone going in warmer months. Why they advertise air-con and not supply it is false advertising and there was no customer service from staff. It certainly is not 4* and definitely not worth the advertised price. The TV supplied was ~ 20 inch and only had BBC World and CNN English channels. Again not what I would have expected for a 4* as we have experienced better in Europe but thats a side as the TV was only on first and last thing of the day. It is however very convenient for Gare de Lyon and Notre Dame areas.", "Date": "March 29, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Beirut, Lebanon", "Title": "\u201cBest & Perfect Hotel in Paris for its exceptional customer service, excellent location & great quality versus price!\u201d", "Author": "NACH112", "ReviewID": "UR126288216", "Content": "Hi everyone, I stayed at this great hotel in Room 209 with my wife & 12 year-old daughter from 4 till 15 March 2012 & we truly want to thank all the great staff of Novotel Gare de Lyon for making our stay a very enjoyable & truly satisfactory experience indeed. First, the Hotel has a very classy & nice historical look from the outside as well as a very modern & beautiful look from the inside & is ideally located very close to Gare De Lyon, which has endless metros & RER\u2019s & TGV\u2019s (Including line 1 of the Champs Elysees & RER A of Galeries Lafayette & Printemps) that can take you anywhere in Paris & in France & beyond. Second, it is the closest hotel you can get to the Air France Shuttle Bus; especially since most taxis refuse to take you for a ride if your hotel is not far, even if you have 4 bags!!! Third, all the well-trained & highly professional staff truly go beyond your regular expectations in terms of customer satisfaction; which reminded me of the great customer service of highly reputable hotels in the U.S. Fourth, the check-in was very smooth & they have 4 speedy & modern lifts, which means no waiting for elevators to reach your room, which you will find extremely modern (with safe & hairdryer & free coffee & tea facilities) & big compared to other European Hotels, who even charge much more for their rooms! Plus, the great thing is that the bathroom had both a bath tub as well as another shower tub; in addition to a seperate toilet! Fifth, the free in-door heated swimming pool was great; especially after a long day of endless walking & stair-climbing in Paris & the great thing is that it was always clean & the Hotel even provides you with towels & lockers, which only costs you 50 centimes or half a Euro, & which you even get back once you re-open your locker :) Six, the open-buffet breakfast was great & very delicious; especially the fresh omelets & mushrooms as well as the delightful \"pain au chocolats\" & various delicious cakes & fresh fruits. Also the experienced lady that draws on faces of children as well as the experienced balloon-man who makes you any form of balloon imaginable were both an added bonus to the breakfast. However, I would have surely preferred if the breakfast during weekdays can still be served until 10 am like in weekends as opposed to 9:30 am; especially that we all like to wake up late during our holidays! Anyway, the good thing is that Continental Breakfast can be ordered to your room in case you wake up late! Here I want to especially thank the waiter who brought, especially for us, a tray of fresh omelets & \u201cpain au chocolats;\u201d since, we came one day later than 9:30 & that was before we knew about the breakfast hours! This is surely customer service at its best :)) Seven, we highly appreciated the fact that my 12 year old daughter\u2019s stay & breakfast was totally free; which is awesome; since, most other hotels in Paris, which I have checked (including Mercure & Ibis) start charging children whose age is older than 11 years old!! Eight, I read some reviews, which stated that the room is hot! Well, I found that it was warm rather than hot & which is great; since, it was very cold outside! Moreover, I advise them to do like I did & which is to kindly ask the reception or Housekeeping to provide them with thin covers rather than the double one, which is usually available. As for the beds, they are very soft & extremely comfortable :) Nine, I read from other reviews that the hotel takes a charge for the adapters (20 Euros added to the bill): Well here I just want to say that it is totally refundable upon checking-out when you return the adapter of your iPhone or iPad charger for example, like I did! Ten, we highly appreciated the fact the WiFi inside the room as well as in the lobby were totally free. In addition to 2 iMac\u2019s in the lobby, which were also free :) Finally, we would like to truly thank the great Hotel Manager as well as all the great staff of this wonderful hotel for making our trip exceptional & highly enjoyable, & we want to specifically thank Mrs. Fares, who personally phoned us several times during our stay to make sure that everything went well & also visited our room to inform us how to reach the Police Station, after my wallet was stolen from the metro & Thank God that the French Police, which I truly thank very much, were able after only 1/2 an hour to capture the thieves & return my wallet! Thanks again to Novotel Gare de Lyon & to the excellent comments of the readers of Trip Advisor, which encouraged me to stay in this hotel in the first place (I also advise the readers to book directly through the hotel website since you get the best deal!). We will surely stay at this special Hotel every single year & maybe more than once a year; especially that you can never find in the wonderful city of Paris, all these great amenities & great customer service & excellent location with such a great & affordable price :) Best Regards, From a loving family who adores Paris :)", "Date": "March 18, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "2", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "London, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cGood hotel, avoid restaurant\u201d", "Author": "Fifi7700", "ReviewID": "UR124990980", "Content": "We stayed here during the February half term break with our two young children.

Breakfast was at 5 am and consisted of a packet of biscuits and some coffee though I imagine a better breakfast occurs later.

The hotel lobby, looks very impressing with the exposed concrete surfaces, the rooms are very clean and absolutely modern! The bathroom was the most modern I\u00b4ve seen so far. It had the funny feature of a glass wall separating the shower from the bedroom and by pressing a button you could make the window foggy and by pressing again clear and transparant. No clue what you woudl need that for, but it\u00b4s funny. The room is also equipped with a nice large flatscreen TV and a NESPRESSO machine (complimentary 3 capsules, one of them decaff.)! The breakfast buffet was pretty good as well. The only bothering thing was the capacity of the breakfast room. There was a queue of at least 25 people ahead of us. Fortunately it was Sunday, it was a family trip, not a business trip and the waiting time was only 15 minutes. In return we were not chared for the excellent breakrast buffet that would have costed us otherwise 16 Euros. When travelling with kids, you will find a nice play corner with lots of video games and some wooden blocks to play (Kapla). The service was not soo great. As I\u00b4ve mentioned the waiting time as pretty long for the breakfast and we needed a 3rd set of towels, because there was 3 adults in the room, but only 2 sets of towels.

The breakfast is free for kids - and that makes it worthwhile overall. It is a great breakfast at the end of it all with crepes, eggs, different types of breads. The high-point for me was the choice and selection of tea that was available! Dinner is an expensive affair - a basic meal was 70 Euros for the four of us.

When we booked the hotel (online), I did not realize the distance between the hotel and the sites (Arc de Triomphe, Tour Eiffel, Notre Dame, etc.). It is a little distant - too far to walk, unless you really like long walks, but the metro station is located right next door in the train station and the metre in Paris if efficient and convient to all locations. Being right next door to the train station on a side street also has some disadvantages - some rough looking characters hanging around the side exits of the station and consequently the hotel doors are locked at night - you have to wave at the front desk personnel to get the doors opened for you if you arrive/come back late in the evening. Don`t take this as a big negative - I did not feel unsafe at any time, just not the best of surroundings. Would consider staying here again.

I was also a bit disappointed the telephone did not work well and although I was told technicians would fix it...it was not. For some reason, I could call the receptions but incoming calls were not passing through. One night I could use Skype instead (internet is free) but it wasn't working well as the bandwidth is certainly not enough for video calls. I also didn't realise the breakfast was included. A good thing but I have never been really impressed by the breakfast. Coffee is placed in pots on your table, so it's never really hot nor tasty when you pour it and if you come late for breakfast, you may have to check on other table to find a pot with some coffee left. I'd much rather an instant coffee machine in the style of Nespresso machines. The orange juice is taken from concentrate juice mixed with ice which I do not like in the morning - not in any way as good as fresh orange juice, or, at least Tropicana/Innocent juices. There also are some pancakes but these are left under a red light which may improve their looks but does not keep them warm. Anyhow, apart from that, there is a good mix of fruits, yoghurt, pastries and other cooked breakfast food available, so if quality may not be great, at least there is a bit of variety. Overall, I was a bit disappointed as I did not have the time to enjoy the gym or swimming pool; I still think this is a good hotel, with a good location.

The Novotel falls into the latter category. We were thankful for its proximity to the Gare de Lyon because we arrived on the 23.30pm from Milan and walked over the road from the station. The next morning, the breakfast buffet was limited in choice, especially if, like me, one has a dairy intolerance. Although prominently displayed is a notice saying either satisfaction or refund, when I mentioned it to the receptionist all I got in return was a shrug a few casual remarks about that being the way breakfast was.

It was prefectly located, right across the road from the Gare de Lyon, very very close to both the Open Top tour bus stop, and also to the Air France bus transport to CDG(just so you know you do not have to be traveling on Air France to use this service, I believe the cost was 16 or 17 euros per adult and about 8 euros per child). The room was clean and nice, and the kids especially loved the hotel's little children's room located just to the side of reception and VERY nicely placed near the two free (and very nice) computers for use. So i could check on my emails from home and tell everyone how much fun we were having in Paris while also being able to keep an eye on my little ones).

This Novotel (a subsidary of the French ACCOR) is located within 1 minute pedestrian zone walk from Gare de Lyon railway station, thus providing an excellent, safe and easy access to the METRO and SNCF rail. Additionally, it is a 2-3 minute walk from several bus stations, including the most unreliable (we came to find out) Les Cars Air France airport bus /shuttle (line 4). You will not be able to get a TAXI without having it called into the hotel, unless you prefer to stand in a long line at the Gare de Lyon entrance. The neighborhood is understandingly busy, even though the immediate area near this Novotel is pedestrian (rear), appeared very safe and quiet (there was some construction noise in the rear room starting at 8am punctually). Even Gare de Lyon is very clean and business-like. There is a manned METRO booth at this station, eliminating the need to use automatic vending machines, should you need a more complicated or multi-day ticket. There are at least 5 large banks with many ATMs in the area, including BNP Paribas a short walk across the street from Gare. We found three Patisseries and at least one Boulangerie nearby (10 minutes walk) with an average quality and the usual Parisian fare. There were two decent size grocery stores within a 4 minutes walk. The hotel is a gray clean concrete block /steel-window building, standing about 10 floors tall and roughly triangularly-shaped, with the Novotel signs visible from all directions and on all walls. It appears modern and well taken care of. The front desk staff spoke English, was pleasant and helpful. The environment was business-like and comfortable. The service was prompt as was the checkout. The rooms were smaller in size, modestly equipped but with plenty of storage, clean and adequate for the four of us as we literally only slept there. The window did not close properly and required additional effort to secure which on the second floor caused us a slight anxiety. There was a sufficient size SAFE LOCK in the room. The bedding was clean. The swimming pool was narrower in size but plenty sufficient for a recreational swim and play.

The toilet is separate, which is great in a family of four. All in all quite a good room, had it been to the back side of the hotel, where there is a pedestrian zone. Had we know that fact, I would have asked for it. Unfortunately the room was to the front / street side and we had to close for the night, as bypassing cars in the small one-way street would have waken us up. The air condition made the climate comfortable though. The ground floor pool was a hit for the children not so much for the parents, as the kids rather wanted to get back to the hotel for the pool and no longer see anything downtown.

If you're leaving with metro or RER, we faced a big problem in buying tickets, as the machines would only accept coins, no banknotes and no credit cards. The queue at the only service desk was very long. We bought several individual items at the station in order to get some coins for paying the metro trip to the Eiffel tower. The wait time at the Eiffel was even longer, about 2 to 3 hours, also very long wait at the one pillar where one can use the steps instead of the elevator. I later checked the advance tickets on the Internet site of Eiffel. They were sold for almost two weeks. So get your tickets well in advance, if you'd like to go up on Eiffel tower ! Going to Disneyland is quite easy, as trains run every 10 minutes and it is a 40 mins ride to the terminal station of RER train line A4 (Marne-la-valee). The drawback here is that you enter the park only with the public at 10 am, when the guests of the Disney hotels are already in for 2 hours, have done already some rides and booked there Fastback tickets.

One of the primary factors in our choice was the availability of pull-out sofas for our children. The hotel is located right by the Gare de Lyon train station, with ready access to the RER and Metro. It's easiest to access the hotel via Sorties 9 or 11 from the station. The signage in the station, however, is abysmal, and maps usually are located nowhere near where you really need them. The room was of adequate size, while the toilet was very small. The toilet lever had to be flipped a second time with every flushing to make it stop running. There were no washcloths in the bathroom (which seems to be common in Europe), only hand towels and bath towels. We were usually not replenished with enough towels for a family of four, but it wasn't hard to track some down. There was somewhat limited closet space, and no iron/ironing board (which also seems common for Europe). The double bed was large and comfortable, and the pull-out beds drew no complaints from my kids. I believe all of those were recently replaced. As with many large, older buildings, the air conditioning is on a chiller system. This means the entire hotel has to be switched at once from heating mode in the winter to cooling mode in the spring. The hotel had not been switched over to cooling mode, so the air conditioning was not functioning. It was a particularly warm week in Paris, so the room was quite warm. The window opened, but there was no real ventilation possible without propping the room door open. We could not, of course, do this at night for security reasons. The room was passable at night with the window open. There was a disturbance at the hostel across the street one night, and the noise prompted me to call the front desk to have it addressed. Other street noise was not as bad, but still noticeable. I'm sure it would have been fine with air conditioning on and window closed. There is complimentary WiFi in the room, but it is only suitable for email/chat/ and general surfing. If you want to use Skype, you'll probably have to purchase one of the higher-bandwidth connections. The staff was generally courteous; one night I was trying to print out online tickets for the Eiffel tower.

Was really surprised at how nice the hotel facilities are. The room was actually a very good size with a comfortable bed, nice bathroom (the small toilet room was not a big deal), good shower by European standards, and a nice view out back facing the train station. We got a very good rate on orbitz which included breakfast. Unfortunately breakfast was pretty bad and extremely crowded and chaotic. It's much better to head out to the street where you can get much better food, esp. if it is not included with your room. The regular rate for breakfast is 16 euros in the hotel. It's probably not worth 5. If this hotel had better service I would have rated it higher. I generally don't pay much attention to service, but this place stood out for the wrong reasons. Our room safe kept malfunctioning. The first time it broke someone came up right away and fixed it in 5 minutes. The second time, a couple of days later, no one came after 20 minutes so I called down again. W/o any provocation, the woman who answered the phone rudely told me someone would be up and nearly hung up on me. Then no one showed for an hour and a half. When the person did show up, they fixed the safe, then told me it wasn't broken, implying I should not have called for help. Not the way to treat your guests. The second service issue was equally strange. I had read b/4 we arrived that the fridge has sensors in it, and it is pretty obvious. But when we checked in, there was actually one open space in there so I opened it and put a bottle of water in there. A couple of days later, the maid removed our water from the fridge, replaced it with one of the hotel's beverages, and threw our bottle away. Not only that, they remotely locked the fridge from the front desk after they threw our bottle away. I am not making this up. I went down to the front desk and told them what happened. The woman at the front desk pretended she was completely clueless about what happened, but did conveniently unlock the fridge. One side note, every time I approached the front desk, I had to repeat myself b/c no one seemed to understand English very well. The location of the hotel is actually not bad at all. You can walk to downtown if you like to walk. It takes about 30 minutes to get to Notre Dame. And in addition to the subway and train connections there are many buses that you can take advantage of, if you are not too fond of the subway like us. You can actually go down to the information booth in the subway and they will not only tell you what bus to take, but print out bus directions for you. Bus 87 will take you to the Eiffel Tower. We bought 5-day Visit Paris passes which were well worth it. Another huge advantage to this hotel is that you can take the Air France shuttle line 4 basically directly to the hotel. The bus stop at Gare de Lyon is about 50 yards from the hotel front door. This will save you alot of money if you are on your own, and a bit less if you are travelling with someone. A roundtrip ticket on the bus is 26 euros, if I remember correctly, and a cab is about 55 euros one way. We had to take a cab when we arrived b/c there was a one-day AF bus strike. Oh, and there are bicycles for rent literally right out the front door - if that's your thing. The Gare de Lyon neighborhood is not bad. There are many restaurants within walking distance, including several where you can carry out. None was particularly worth mentioning. On a good note, many of them are open very very late if not all night. And even though the hotel is next to the train station, it is on a very quiet side street. Our room, no. 334 I believe, faced the train station which was nice. The station is far enough away that you don't hear anything. In fact, you're so far away that you can't get a really good look at the trains, although it is still a very nice view. All in all, this place could be alot better with a better trained staff. For gym buffs, there is a very nice gym, and also the lobby has two apple computers with free access to the internet. You have to pay for access in the rooms.

The toilet was separate and very small space to get in. In our room we could and did open the window; it got stuffy otherwise. As we were accompanying an African student unfamiliar with European restaurants, we decided to have both dinner and breakfast in the hotel. The dining room looks towards the station, providing interesting views for our guest. A straightforward menu which was identical in the 3 Novotel on this trip. Service was friendly but perhaps too swift as they coped with a full restaurant that night. Breakfast was also busy. Buffet style. The cut fruit was mostly tinned but the were bananas, apples, and fresh tangerines. Two types of sliced cheese, but no fish. Bread was mostly baguette. Unlike Novotel in Poland, breakfasts in French Novotel are not very imaginative. There is a narrow swimming pool but we did not use it. We paid EUR 170 for half board for the room with two people.

That would be my ONLY complaint. The location was perfect - we caught the open top bus not far from the hotel the first day and the second day, the weather was so lovely we walked around the entire city. It is BEAUTIFUL and the people were SO FRIENDLY and helpful (traveling with children and a pram is often difficult in London, Paris, etc. because the tube/metro are not pram friendly). It was perfect for our little family and I would definitely stay there again! We recommended it to friends who were traveling to Paris just a few months ago and have small children - and they will be recommending it to their friends because it fit their family just as well!", "Date": "July 2, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Columbus, Ohio", "Title": "\u201cGreat hotel with Awesome staff!\u201d", "Author": "Ohionotes", "ReviewID": "UR33333261", "Content": "I highly recommend this hotel for ANYONE, but especially if you are travelling with young children.

Even though we had already checked out of the hotel, we returned there to get our car. The front desk staff was SO HELPFUL!

We were very pleased. This hotel would be good for Business, families or couples traveling. This is a modern hotel with more amenities than most Paris hotels. They include shampoo, shower gel, soap, instant coffee, tea bags, a large serving pot to heat water, in-room safe, hairdryer, TV, free internet in the lobby and more. There is an exercise room and indoor heated pool. The pool has separate men\u2019s and women\u2019s entrances. Each has lockers, towels, and its own bathroom with a shower. The hotel is in a great location. It is next to a large train station that can get you anywhere. You cannot hear the trains at all. This is a safe neighborhood. We were walking around at 10 pm with no worries. There are many restaurants in the area especially across from the steps to the train station. The hotel front desk staff is very friendly, knowledgeable and helpful. They speak fluent English and other languages as well. Have them give you a map of Paris with the attractions. The map is helpful and can give you ideas of what to visit. They don\u2019t have a converter for all countries electricty. Buy and bring your own if you are coming from the USA or Canada so that you can charge your camera batteries and other items. The hotel has 3 types of rooms: Superior, Executive and Suites. The Superior rooms are Full size bed, Full size with sofa bed, Queen size bed or Queen size bed with a sofa bed. All these are the same price so ask for the Queen size with sofa. I didn\u2019t see an Executive or Suite room. We had a Superior room that had the Queen bed and sofa. It was nice, roomy and had a comfortable bed. The bathroom had both a bathtub and shower. The toilet is in a separate spot. The hotel has a cafe and a restaurant. Both are expensive. The regular breakfast is 8 Euros for just a Croissant, cup of coffee and glass of juice. The full breakfast is 16 euros. Many local restaurants are open for breakfast and much cheaper. Here is what we did. Go out the front door and walk straight down the street (with train station to the left). When you get to the corner there is a Patissiere/Bakery straight ahead. Just cross the crazy intersection. We would get ready in the morning, put on a pot of water to heat, and go get breakfast at the Bakery. Croissants are less than 1 euro, and quiche is 1.95 euros, other bakery items are not expensive. They heated and then wrapped up the quiche. We took our food back to the hotel, made coffee or tea and ate our quiche (still warm). They also sell sandwiches and bakery items cheaper than anyone else. All items were delicious. To get to the metro go out the front door and turn right. Go to the corner and turn left. Just ahead is the closest metro stop. The actual train station has many levels and can get you to other metro routes and trains. You can get to the train station easiest from the hotel back entrance. At the train station we bought the 5 day, 3 zone Metro pass. This will get you to all the popular Paris attractions. They can also give you a metro map. You can buy a one day pass to zone 4 to get to Versailles, or another zone to go to EuroDisney. If you go to Versailles on Sat or Sunday you now have to pay an extra fee to go into the gardens because they turn on the fountains twice a day on weekends. It was not worth the 8 euros to see the fountains spray water, I recommend going on a weekday. We did go up to St. Dennis Basilique (still in zone 3). Beautiful church with many kings and queens buried there. Also not crowded. We bought the museum pass. It was not worth what they charged for it so I would not buy it again. It didn\u2019t include many museums that we came across and we still had to stand in line in most places. You should note that Paris restaurants include the tip. It is included even if not shown on the receipt.

The room is clean and very spacious for Paris particularly if you get one of the queen bedroom with a pull out couch for another 2 people.

So, if you are tired of getting one of those \u2018charming\u2019, tiny, old broom closets that called itself a hotel room, this is a welcome change. I would imagine this to be a great deal if you are traveling with kids, which is not our case. The bathroom is interesting. It has separate bathtub and shower stall. The toilet is in a separate adjacent room the size of an airline toilet. The whole setup is a pre-fab, efficiency module plunk down into a corner of the room much like those you find in crusie ships. The swimming pool, while not large, is decent and unexpected for a city establishment. It is opened 24 hours. Given the hotel is right next to a major rail station, the environment is a bit down market. Not really an issue if you use the place as a base for sight seeing using the metro. Getting to metro is interesting. As previous posters have mentioned, if you got yourself into Gare de Lyon station itself, it is a huge maze with long walks and not easy to find directions. However, Metro line 1 is really very close (less than 5 mintues) if you know the way. (a) Face the reception desk at the lobby, (b) Exit to hotel on the right of the recption desk (c) Walk straight out into the small street and to the main street (d) turn right at the main street and you should see the red Metro sign a few meters ahead of the Chinese restaurant (which is actually not bad at all). The train track is just down the stair case. Basically, the metro is less than 5 minutes from the hotel \u2013 if you do not go into Gare de Lyon.

There is also free internet in the foyer. The hotel pool was open 24 hours which I thought was fantastic. We used it when we came back from dinner at midnight and it is perfect if you want to relax after arriving on an evening flight. Don't worry about noise. The pool is below the foyer and isn't near any of the rooms and we heard no noise at all. The gym was still open at 10pm but was closed when we came back from dinner. Be careful about eating in restaurants near the Gare de Lyon. Prices are very high to take advantage of those coming form the Air France CDG shuttle bus and the TGV trains. At one restaurant we sat down and were told that unless we were ordered 4 pizzas we would not be allowed to eat there. We could not believe it and went to a great all night takeaway/ pizza shop. Prices were very reasonable, they were very fiendly and they were proper pizzas. You can sit outside as well! As you leave the hotel go straight ahead and when you get to where all the motorcycles are parked turn right onto boulevard dideroit. If you want to eat at a restaurant I would recomment taking a metro two stops east on the metro line 1 which is a nice area with alot more restaurants. There are also fast food shops like McDonalds and Quick. There is a velib station near the hotel and I would recommend using this if you want to hire bikes in Paris. It's great but be aware that you will have to pay a \u20ac150 deposit which will take 5 days to go back to your bank account. The only negative about the hotel is that in contry to what one of the previous guests said, it is unlikely that you will see the TGVs from your room. We asked for a room with a view of the trains and the receptionist was very helpful but understandably because of the curved shape of the building there are only 4 rooms on each floor which would definately have a view of the trains.

There were a couple of local supermarkets nearby within a 10minute walk, so it was good to get some supplies. The train station itself was great for lunch, with lots of baguettes, pastries, drinks available. The hotel and rooms are very modern, bed was huge and comfortable, water pressure excellent in shower. My main disappointment is the level of noise that could be heard eg every door that closed (slammed shut) around us could easily be heard. At one point early in the morning I wondered what a particular noise was behind my pillows thru the wall - I then realised someone was stirring their coffee vigorously with their spoon in the room next door. For a 4 star hotel I guess I expected to be a little bit 'cocooned' from noise. We were far down a corridor so we at least did not have to put up with any nearby lifts (that would 'ding' each time reaching a floor). The restaurant was quite pricey and although we tried to entertain the waiting staff with our limited French, there was a lot that was lost in translation - however the Front Desk lobby staff were always more than helpful, had excellent English and more than happy to assist with our touristy questions.", "Date": "June 4, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Cambridge, UK", "Title": "\u201cFantastic family hotel\u201d", "Author": "RAECambridge_UK", "ReviewID": "UR16507464", "Content": "Having read other reviews on this site, we decided to book this hotel for the swimming pool, as we have children aged 8 and 9 (if weather was miserable we would occupy them and if it was hot, we could cool off!)

The children were happy! But as the bar is very close to the games room - we were very happy too! Rooms were not large, but had separate loo to the bathroom and very comfy beds. Breakfast was good, as long as you left yourself time to eat it - they started clearing up bang on time! The hotel is very easy to find - metro line 1- and within easy access to everything in Paris.

I really wished I'd read my last review in more detail as I had forgotten just how warm and stuffy the rooms in this hotel are. In fact the whole hotel is like it! I think I got lulled into a false sense of security because we (as a family) stayed in 3 different Novotels last year and generally had a good experience in all three. The rooms are clean, the locations are generally very good and the breakfasts are excellent. This time however, the warmth and general stuffiness of the room was almost unbearable. We happen to have a clock with a thermometer and it was reading between 25 degrees and 26 degrees the whole time we were there (it was 8 degrees outside). The climate control is actually a fan (nope its not air-conditioning, its a fan which sounds like air con, but does next to nothing to reduce the temperature of your room when running at full speed). We slept with the window open which wasn't quiet but at least we had a trickle of fresh air circulating. Now it may be we were unlucky with the rooms again but having spoken to a number of other guests, they complained of the same thing. When we actually complained to the staff, they were less than interested. Admittedly there was little they could do but their attitude was frankly Parisien! My advice is if you are planning to stay here, take a fan with you. It will make the stay all together more pleasant. My advice to Novotel is either install Air-Con (I'm sorry but there really is no excuse not to have it) or provide ceiling or desktop fans. Oh yes and on the last morning, we queued for 15 mins for breakfast. There were alot of families staying in the hotel...maybe someone should have realised. They all looked hot and bothered as well!!!", "Date": "April 20, 2008"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Novotel Paris Gare de Lyon", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g187147-d197486-Reviews-Novotel_Paris_Gare_de_Lyon-Paris_Ile_de_France.html", "Price": "$184 - $313*", "Address": "<address> <span rel=\"v:address\"> <span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">2 rue Hector Malot</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:postal-code\">75012</span> <span property=\"v:locality\">Paris</span></span>, <span class=\"country-name\" property=\"v:country-name\">France</span> </span> </span> </address>", "HotelID": "2515246", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/01/bf/c9/3c/piscine-interieure-chauffee.jpg"}}
