Nice property, great beds, friendly staff; it's just the logistics that mess this place up. RESERVATIONS/CHECK-IN: I made a reservation here on 1/28, after doing my homework here in the lovely TripAdvisor-land as well as Yelp. Later in the day, I saw that they had a lower special rate in celebration of their 2-yr anniversary. Made the new reservation and canceled the previous one, getting email confirmations for everything. Once I arrived at the hotel 3 weeks later, BOTH my reservations were canceled --?! The Asst. Manager had to be called in to fix the problem. After a 15-20 minute wait, he found a room. Being a former hotel employee and an avid traveler I know that when you wait for a room to become available it's either a) a room that needs housekeeping or b) a room that's been pulled from their \"do not sell\" repair inventory as a last resort. I believe it was the latter for us, as there were a few technical issues with our room (203), which was by the elevator and ice machine. That said, the room overall was decent. Here's the weird thing: it's not the end of the world, but even though the manager was pleasant enough, he never apologized for the mishap with the reservation or for the wait. :( PARKING: Yup. As everyone complains, parking does suck. Oh well! Even though I could've paid the $30/nt parking fee, I chose the streets. I'm used to navigating for parking as an Angeleno (LA). Keep in mind there are literally only 10-12 parking spaces available around the hotel heading north and south on SW 25th Rd and 5 spots on Miami Ave., so read the signs carefully. We saw two cars getting towed during our 3-day stay. (It is odd there's so little street parking, but the neighborhood is really nice and quiet.) I'd suggest they either reduce their fee a smidgen ($22 vs. $29) or maybe strike a deal with Miami Parking Authority for LOT #23 just a few feet away (right now I think it's registered decal-only parking). Just a thought, if the GM is reading this review. :) AMENITIES: Beautiful space! Great pool area; in fact, the pool area was the main reason I chose this hotel. Comfortable poolside seating in great condition, waterfall, firepit, cabana-style seating with flat-screens. Very nice! Though we didn't eat at the restaurant, we did order food from the bar and room service. Basic food items, mostly appetizer-type dishes (calamari, flat pizza, etc.). Rooms are tastefully decorated and fairly clean (a few noticeable scuff marks along the walls, as well as a broken bathroom door handle and minor other issues) with super comfortable bedding. Hotel has a small fitness room, but we didn't use it. STAFF: Super nice people! Doorman Jairo was awesome!! Thank you to Soy, the bartender, who has to multitask as bartender, waitress and room service attendant. Front Desk staff was friendly too, as well as the housekeepers. Asst. Manager Evan was a bit aloof, but polite. OVERALL: Like I said earlier, this place has plenty of pluses, especially its physical attributes; but for a hotel of only 60-65 rooms it should be run like a tight ship. Given they just celebrated their two year anniversary, I truly hope they'll get a better handle on things for two more years.

However, I feel compelled to detail our recent experiences at the Hotel Urbano, as it the first time I have been dissatisfied with a property for which the consensus view appeared so positive. Our family of four adults stayed at Hotel Urbano for two one-night visits. I chose this hotel because the negative comments on this site were mostly about things that did not concern me (such as the high cost of valet parking) and the positives were persuasive. The first visit, we had connecting rooms. One room, 214, was very good; the other, 215, turned out to have a nonfunctional toilet, poor water pressure in the shower and a general air of neglect. Both rooms were quite quiet despite being eye level with I-95 (the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153city view\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd), and had excellent beds; so we were content to share the toilet in room 214 and we managed just fine for the night. We decided to return for the second stay, assuming the inadequacy of room 215 was a fluke. An apologetic manager gave us vouchers for a free breakfast for that return stay as well, a level of service that also reassured us that all would be well. Unfortunately, for our second stay, we found both rooms 301 and 303 to be sub-par because of a throbbing mechanical noise. I see now that one other review has already noted this problem for room 301; similar noise was also audible in room 303, room 325 (which was offered to me as a potential switch), and also apparently in 302, as the occupant of that room came into ours to ask if we had a noise problem. It may be that sort of noise would not bother some people, but I could not get used to it and could not sleep. The water pressure in both 301 and 303 was inadequate, too. Very disappointing. I am sorry to have to give this hotel a poor rating, because the staff members were very nice, the beds are really comfortable, and the location is very convenient; if all rooms had been like 214, the venue would represent good value. But one room out of four being good is not good enough for anything better than \u00e2\u20ac\u0153poor\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd.", "Date": "January 31, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Location": "3", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "pittsburgh,PA", "Title": "\u201cAverage at best\u201d", "Author": "pghfoodie", "ReviewID": "UR123755586", "Content": "Ok location.

This place is only acceptable as a place to lay your head down for a night before going out on a cruise or something, not for an extended stay. It most closely resembles a nicely decorated MOtel than a beautiful resort-like oasis. It resembles a Howard Johnson Hotel from the outside. But it wouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t take much work to be what they desire to be. My major suggestion for this place is as follows: They need a manager with a strong presence to make sure everyone if properly trained and completing their duties continually. This person needs to be able to address guest concerns/questions. The current staff cannot. The place is so tiny. The manager should just be doing laps around this place and whip everyone into gear. They need to offer real food selections for lunch and dinner. Most of their current items could be prepared in an EZ bake oven (not a joke). Also, they need to drop their inflated parking charges. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a more detailed description of things: Safety/Health Concerns/Security: The drinking glasses: They weren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t cleaned for days. I had been drinking Coke from my drinking glass, and the maid overlooked it for a few days. Finally, I noticed my drinking glass was re-wrapped in clear plastic, like its partner glass. However, when I unwrapped the drinking glass, it had not been cleaned, just re-wrapped. I could see the Coke syrup stuck to the bottom-inside of the glass. There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s no doubt that if I had not unwrapped this glass it would have been presented this way for the next guest. Dangerous gauntlet: This small room left no place to leave luggage. The only solution was to leave the luggage within the regular walking path to the bed, to the bathroom, and to the front door. I tripped over my own luggage several times on middle-of-the-night bathroom visits, stubbing my toe each time. So did my wife. We had no other place to put the luggage. Decapitation: The bathroom door is a slider. When you open the bathroom door, it slides to close the closet. When you close the closet, it opens the bathroom door. My wife was removing her jewelry from the closet\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s safe. When I exited the bathroom, the door slid open and nearly slammed into her head. I never thought that I had to be so careful opening a bathroom door. Who would? Note: the bathroom door also has no locks. Shower temperature: The shower temperature knob is not properly aligned. Sometimes \u00e2\u20ac\u0153cold\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd is \u00e2\u20ac\u0153hot.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Sometimes \u00e2\u20ac\u0153hot\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd is \u00e2\u20ac\u0153cold.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Usually, the area right between hot and cold was SCALDING hot. Then, one day, we coldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t get any hot water no matter where we put the temperature knob. I complained to the front desk about this, explaining everything above. They fixed the problem so that it was back to the original problem- scalding water when you have it set for \u00e2\u20ac\u0153barely warm.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Electrical burning smell: at midnight one night, my wife and I simultaneously smelled a burning electrical smell in the room. I went to the front desk to report the issue. The woman at the desk called security. I walked back to my room and saw security browsing the internet on the lobby computer. I asked him if he was security. He followed me to my room, and sniffed around like a bloodhound. He said that it was nothing. The woman from the front desk followed. She said that if it gets worse to tell her and she\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d switch my room. I know there was a bit of a language barrier with the security guard, but as he left the room, he literally said, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Be quiet. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s nothing.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd He said it with a smile on his face, but the words themselves were quite rude. Temperature: Sneaky Sneaky Thermostats: This thermostat has motion sensors. When you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re out of the room, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not keeping it cool for you. Also, when you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re sleeping, it shuts off when it doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t detect movement. I read the manual for this thermosat to learn how to bypass these features. Press the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153power\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd and the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153cooler\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd button simultaneously and it will bypass these features for 48 hours. Also, there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s no doubt in my mind that this thermostat lied about the temperature by about 5 degrees. After reading the manual, I found that the thermostat actually does not begin blowing cold air again until the temperature is \u00e2\u20ac\u0153off\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd by 4 degrees. In other words, if you set the thermostat for 65 degrees (the minimum), the air won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t start blowing until it reaches 69 degrees. Take into consideration the fact that the thermostat lies about the temperature, this means that the temperature gets to nearly 75 when you set it for 65. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not my idea of comfort. The pool is too warm. Feels like a hot tub (not much of a complaint, I know). Hidden Fees: Parking: Parking is $25 + tax. $30 per day total. Too much money. I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t care if everyone in Miami charges for parking. That doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t make it right. I was informed of street parking somewhere in the area. This street parking was impossible to find. Don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t bother. I asked the valet the following question: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153If I find street parking one day, how does the hotel know that I did not park the car using the $30 valet service?\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The valet didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t understand. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153In other words, today is Monday, suppose that I want to park in the street on Tuesday. What time do I need to get my car out of the valet and drag it out to the street to avoid the parking charges.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd He responded by telling me that he doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t know the answer to my question. I then asked how they figure out who is in the lot and should be charged each day. He said, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We count the keys at midnight.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd I responded, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153So at midnight are you charging me for Monday or for Tuesday?\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd He didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t know the answer. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Complimentary Continental Breakfast\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd: We booked a package which included this. However, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a scam. It covers a bagel or muffin, and a juice. However, there is then a service charge which is just about what it costs to buy a bagel, a muffin, and juice. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m not exactly sure what a service charge is. The tip? Either way, the waitress told me that my \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Complimentary Continental Breakfast\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd would cost me $2.50. If you find the right waitress, they will actually take your complimentary continental breakfast card and apply $10 to each of your meals from the real breakfast menu. However, she will make it clear that they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re not supposed to do that. I actually had a pretty good breakfast when I found someone who would do this. For my wife and I, it totaled only about $10 after tip- and we ate pancakes and juevos rancheros. Incompetence: Upon checking in, Nelson gave me our \u00e2\u20ac\u0153complimentary continental breakfast\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd card. He gave me only one card. I said to him, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t my wife need one too?\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd He told me that the card is good for two people, though it doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t say that anywhere. I triple confirmed this with him. Can you guess what happened the first morning? Fast forward to the next day. I asked Nelson why the complimentary continental breakfast card stated that it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not good for room service, yet his said differently upon checking in. He said that he would check on it. He disappeared. Literally, he disappeared for the rest of the day without responding to me. I was waiting by his desk. Luckily, someone else (who also didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t know the answer) was able to address me and roll her eyes at the fact that Nelson had done a disappearing act. The woman at the counter had to ask a waitress if the card applied to room service, and I found out that the answer is, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It depends on who the waitress is.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m not exactly sure how you find that bit of information out when you call for room service the next morning, nor am I sure I understand why this is my responsibility. We just decided that we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d eat elsewhere. The maid was not returning our pool towels regularly after taking the dirty towels. There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s signs that missing towels will cost you $30 or so. I called the front desk to explain that I need these replaced and shouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be charged. She said she\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d send some towels down instantly. However, an hour and a half later there were not towels delivered to my room. I stopped by the front desk and she told me that they were drying my towels and she\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d deliver them to the pool for me. I heard another story from someone who did not have their towels replaced and the maid pulled a disappearing act when she agreed to replace the towels. This hotel boasts of a beautiful fire pit that resides outside near the pool. I never saw it lit, not once in our week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s stay. One night, I asked Nelson if he could light it for me. He had to call for backup- a manager who never responded to his radio calls. I realized this was a lost cause, so I asked the bartender. He was very friendly, and said he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d light it for me. We walked outside together. He brought a remote control and bbq lighter. He tooled around for about five minutes, with me standing three feet behind him. He stated, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It worked for an hour yesterday,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd and he retreated inside. He never came back out to try again, sent someone else back out, apologized, or explain that he gave up, nothing. He just pulled a disappearing act. Ask the girl behind the bar what the price of a glass of Scotch is, she\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll say \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t know. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m not the bartender.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Ask the guy at the front desk a front desk related question and he will tell you he doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t know because he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the valet. Overbooking?: While I was staying in this hotel, many were complaining that they were overbooked and they were \u00e2\u20ac\u0153bumped\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd from the hotel. I must say, the place was EMPTY every day except for the last of our stay when a conference was there. The dates in which the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153overbooked\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd parties were supposed to have stayed at the hotel were completely EMPTY. I would be surprised if there were ten rooms booked in the hotel until five days later. For me, this actually made for some very peaceful time at the pool. But those other people got the short end of the stick. Housekeeping: I explained the towel and drinking glasses already, but there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s more to say. First, she disregards the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153do not disturb\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd sign and knocks anyway. I had a can of soda explode in the fridge and I cleaned it myself using one of the washcloths. It looked really nasty. I guess that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s why the maid left it on my bathroom floor for two days. No backup toilet paper left in the room. Headboard had someone\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s \u00e2\u20ac\u0153headgrease\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd on it. Food: Good breakfast menu. However, there are only 5 things on the menu for lunch and dinner, and they are all what you would consider finger food or appetizers: Caesar salad, flatbread pizza, wings, coconut chicken, jalapeno poppers, calamari fritters, and a shrimp roll. Make a dinner out of that! There is absolutely nothing else on the menu. The menu has recently been scaled down. There is no \u00e2\u20ac\u0153chef\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd here. Only \u00e2\u20ac\u0153cooks.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Big difference. Room accommodations: This hotel does not come close to offering the accommodations of any three star hotel I have ever visited. We paid for the largest upgrade available, the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153King Lanai.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The room boasted of a private deck with deck furniture, and direct access to the pool, fire pit, and cabanas. You couldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t sit on the private deck. It was in desperate need of an umbrella. The room was tiny. Too small for a king-sized bed. There is no place to put your luggage so that it is out of the way. You have no choice but to put it on the floor. No luggage stand, though some of the standard rooms do have this. Ours didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t, nor was there room for one. We had to put our stuff right in our walking path. The closet has a safe in it that is mounted a foot off the ground, so you can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t put the bags in there. There are only three SMALL draws, so you can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t even unpack more than a day\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s worth of clothes. You have no choice but to live out of your suitcase- which you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll trip over. The bathroom is not large. There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s no wonder why telephone representatives do not disclose the square footage of the room. It barely fits the bed. Sound: Room refrigerator can be loud with a high-pitched sound. Air conditioner can sometimes sound like a faucet dripping. If you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re on the first floor, you will hear people in the hallway during conferences (at about 8am). You can also hear some lobby noise and pool noise- but it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s faint. Overall, not a tremendous issue here. Attention to detail: I hate toilets that have the wrong shaped toilet seat for the bowl. Round toilets should have a round seat, not an oval one. If you think this is trite, try sitting on the wrong shape and get back to me. It dramatically decreases the open space in which you can do your business. Televisions in the two outdoor cabanas often times do not work, nor is there a remote control to use. You have to stand on a chair and play with the cable box, usually to find out that it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not working. Outdoor lights, which are on \u00e2\u20ac\u0153stakes\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd in the concrete, are crooked and unsightly. Straws, bottle caps, leaves, all over the pool deck, and even in the pool- yet there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s nobody in this place to even be creating this mess. Waitress service: Nobody comes outside to see if I want a drink while in the pool or sunbathing. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not uncommon for me to drop $50 poolside. They should try to make a few dollars through service, not from nickel and diming me on parking. Decorations: Decorated with that \u00e2\u20ac\u0153art-deco, ultra-modern, Soho\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd styled furniture. I happen to find this type of furniture to look cold and uninviting. The valet stand smell like unlit marijuana. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not the bushes (like he told me). It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s marijuana. The manager should get out from hiding, make him walk a beat from the valet stand to the front desk, to the bar, to the restaurant, to the pool area. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s so small, this is probably about fifteen steps in each direction. Someone needs to properly train the staff, be available to address guests\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 questions, and to hold staff accountable for sub-par service.", "Date": "August 22, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Guayaquil", "Title": "\u201cLITTLE BUT VERY NICE\u201d", "Author": "cpazmino", "ReviewID": "UR116942828", "Content": "Little hotel and rooms.

From the moment we arrived, we knew we had found a great option for future stays in the Miami area. We have traveled extensively to many types of hotels and the Urbano now rates as one of our favorites. The staff is incredible. We were always greeted warmly at the front door and by the staff assisting at the front desk and at the bar. There was a timely and friendly response to any requests we made during our stay. We really enjoyed relaxing at the bar and poolside throughout our stay because the hotel feels like a calm oasis. We met other travelers who also shared their delight in having found this place. Victoria and Aaron at the bar and Alicia, Nelson and Marcia at the front desk offered helpful advice including places to go during our stay. As other reviewers have mentioned, the hotel is in a residential area and is not convenient for walking to restaurants. It is, however, convenient for driving short distances to restaurants in Brickell and to the South Beach area. After spending a day at the public beach (not overly crowed the weekend we were there...and a very pleasant experience) and eating at a South Beach restaurant (restaurants lining the road in front of the beach are ridiculously expensive and have a carnival-like atmosphere with proprietors calling out \"deals\" to entice customers), we were happy to be returning to our hotel away from the fun but crazy atmosphere of South Beach. Other things to consider when booking this hotel include the fact that although the shower is large and the bathroom space is more than adequate, there is no tub. The restaurant breakfast menu is fabulous with huge portions and decent prices but the lunch/dinner menu is a short list of bar food - very good bar food but not a lot of options. However, we felt perfectly comfortable ordering food to be delivered from area restaurants to our poolside table at the end of the day. Others did this as well.

I have worked in hotels and I am a very picky hotel person so that being said I did a lot of research before choosing the Hotel Urbano. I liked the price, the location and the art boutique theme, and I was not at all disappointed upon check in. The best part of this hotel is the staff, everyone is VERY friendly and very polite. We were checked in promptly, our room was ready, and our car was parked for us. Yes you do have to pay for the valet every night but it really is the safest and easiest way to have a car and stay here. The room was spacious and beautiful. Tastefully decorated and the bed was SOOO comfortable. The bathroom was a great size - we did not have a tub in our bathroom so if you are someone who likes a bath double check this when you make your reservation. There were pool towels in the bathroom and everything was clean which is something I automatically check. We had a couple of cocktails by the pool and Robert was excellent - he made my fiance a delicious pina colade, had him try it first to make sure it was good. We also had appetizers one night also out by the pool and they were very good. Breakfast might have been my absolute favorite part. Everything was cooked fresh and it was sooooooooo good. I highly recommend the huevos rancheros - I can still taste them now.

We had 2 days reservations early July and after 2 weeks at Urbano's while in Miami. In our first stay, we had issues with the check in, while they said the check in time was at 3pm, we arrived 3:45 and they told us they didnt have any room available and we had to wait 1 hour to get our room. Then when we tried to shower at night, there was not water pressure in shower. The next morning we complained and they promissed to have mantainance to check it, when we got back at night, what a surprise! we had to shower with help of plastci cups as there was still no water pressure. Next morning was even worst, and when mantainance came, they told us we had to use another bathroom in another room... When we left, my husband complained to the general manager and asked to get us special attention as we would be back in 2 weeks... What a surprise when we got back, the doorman already told us there was some issues with our reservations... they have olversold the rooms and when we got there at 8pm with 2 little kids ready to take a shower and go to bed, and no room available!! they offered us a \"sister\" hotel near dadeland... which is 30 minuts by car... We said we couldnt as our whole family lives in Brickell ave and that was the whole point to stay at their hotel, to be at that specific location. We asked for any hotel at brickell and they wouldnt do anything, just the old same lime \"we understand... no sir, you do not understand as you havent been travleing with 2 kids. The only thing we need a hotel to have is: good shower, clean sheets and good staff. The hotel failed in this 3 basics requests. We had to solve our own problem calling the Marriot hotel and getting ourselves another reservation and they will pay for the one night. Even so, we will have to wait 7 days to get a check in the mail... and how sure can we be that they will even do that? will update the post if we dont get it.. thats for sure! The lesson they should leanr is to focus on basics that the hotel should have and not in happy houirs, bar man, decorations... this is not your core business. and I do not think they will be in business for too long if they keep doing things this way.", "Date": "July 17, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cGreat Art boutique Miami hotel\u201d", "Author": "Miami_traveler2011", "ReviewID": "UR115376915", "Content": "I have stayed here twice.

Wow, what a great hotel. I arrived just before the kitchen closed and the staff knocked themselves out to make sure I got my food. The next morning the staff were very helpful about everything. More than helpful, I got the feeling that the managers at the Urbano managed to create a really tight team that included everyone from the doormen to the night bartender to the cooks to the front desk staff. I know how hard it can be to build a service team like that so I really appreciated it. My only regret is that I was traveling by myself and I couldn't share this great little hotel with my wife. After my business meeting I took a dip in the pool which has been done very nicely. Also, the bartender made me the best Manhattan I have ever had.

The king size bed was fabulous, with overstuffed down blankets and a rollaway that was comfortable for our 7 year old son. All the furniture was new. They even provide large pool towels.

Hubby described the comfort of the bed and bedding as the best he'd ever experienced. However, after a while the down duvet was too hot and not necessary in a warm climate.

And during Labor Day weekend both Loews and the Fontainebleau were sky high in pricing. Prices of course vary across the map-in Miami Beach you can pay big $$ for a lousy 50\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcArt Deco\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd hotel or decent $ for one that surprises you. Hotel Urbano is of the second category-casual South Beach style elegance with a staff the loves its hotel and who treats the guests who stay there very well. The staff makes this hotel, and they are very proud of their little hotel as they should be. While it isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t in Miami Beach proper, once you walk through the doors you don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t care-a hotel this nice would cost 3 times the amount in South Beach. Hotel Urbano is south of downtown Miami about a mile, along the Biscayne Bay coast. Truth in advertising, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 2 blocks away from I-95 and one block away from Rickenbacker Causeway, the main highway to Key Biscayne. Google map it and you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll see what I mean. The address of the hotel is 2500 Brickell Avenue, Miami, Fl. It is in a very nice and quiet neighborhood. No rooms face I-95 and the rooms that face south to Rickenbacker causeway are masked by some very nice foliage so you won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t see the expressway unless you get a east facing room, and then it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s minimal as you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d have to look pretty far to the right to see it. We came from the Miami airport, so from there, you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll travel I-95 to get here. You\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll see the Hotel Urbano sign to your right, once you get to 25th Road and Brickell. The entry is a small stone paved semi circle Drive. A bellman is available to park your car and bring luggage upstairs. The front desk area is small and right off the entrance. When you walk in you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll see the front desk to the left and a gorgeous view of a pool and cocktail bar straight ahead, as well as the dining room to the right. The signature of this hotel is its art-lots of original works, some for sale, in the South Beach eclectic fashionable style. Its clear someone put a lot of thought into its design and ambience. The front desk was very nice-we booked a King size city view, through our \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I Prefer\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Preferred Hotels guest program for $72 dollars a night with breakfast, using our Visa Signature card as this was their promotion with Hotel Urbano.. Anyone can do this on the Preferred Hotels website-it just gets you better deals than Priceline or Orbitz, and without the subhuman class treatment one gets booking through 3rd party websites. Our \u00e2\u20ac\u0153city view\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd room faced some non-descript apartment building to the east, overlooking the drive way into Hotel Urbano. We ordered some cocktails from the bar, and asked if we could be moved to a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153pool view\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd room. Much better. Our first day here was the Sunday of Labor Day weekend and we were booked for 7 days. Had we been here Friday, I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t they could have upgraded us, but they had a lot of check-outs with the weekend ending so we got our \u00e2\u20ac\u0153complimentary upgrade\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd-second floor room . To be honest, you don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t really see downtown Miami skyline from here-what you see above the palm tree line is 4 high rise residential towers to the north, and the furthest tower is about a \u00c2\u00bd mile from downtown, and the pool. The bellman moved everything to our new room while we went in to go have dinner in South Beach (about 8 miles away to the north and east). When we returned, everything-our bags and clothes were placed exactly as they were in the old room-impressive! Not only that but later we discovered one of our cell phones was left charging in the old room. No problem-the desk supervisor brought it up herself. So by then we knew we were also dealing with an honest, competent staff. We avoided the exorbitant $24 a night \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Valet parking fee\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd by parking on the street. We had a Volvo convertible rental car and there were no problems parking \u00c2\u00bd block away. When you visit South Beach or Ft. Lauderdale, just be prepared for the sticker shock on drink prices-beers can be $6-$8 and Mojito\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s $10 to $20. Some of them-especially on the Ocean Avenue happy hours-feel very watered down. And there are some tourist trap restaurants you want to avoid like the Carlyle (where the movie \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The Birdcage\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd was filmed). Horrible food and service. I actually found the Trip Advisor restaurant forum to be very helpful. We found a fantastic Cuban restaurant called Yuca on the Lincoln Road Mall. through the Trip Advisor forum. This mall and Espanola Way in South Beach are fun to explore! The pool itself , at Hotel Urbano, is small. It goes from 3 feet to 5 feet in a matter of 30 feet or so. But they make the most of it with 4 cabanas, lots of chaise lounges and lush landscaping. You\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll even find palm trees that actually drop coconuts! Nice music piped into the pool area-very sophisticated. The pool and the room photos are exactly what you get when you get to Hotel Urbano-no website puffery there. This hotel reminds me a great deal of the Ambrose in Santa Monica-incredible once you get within the 4 walls, in a nice residential neighborhood, but driving distance to the beach. Here are some our our high points an low points for Hotel Urbano: Pluses- Free Hi speed Wifi throughout The staff-especially Erika, our breakfast server and bartender Breakfast Maid Service-it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s excellent Fitness Room D\u00c3\u00a9cor Pool/Ambience In room safe, coffeemaker, Ipod docking station and flat screen TV Neighborhood Access to downtown, South Beach, Key Biscayne, Coconut Grove, Key West, Fort Lauderdale, the Miami Airport and Coral Gables is great! Minuses- The \u00e2\u20ac\u0153service charges\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd on every order Very slow kitchen The feeling in some places of an old Hampton Inn The price (and size) of the cocktails No baths-only showers Limited closet space The constant reference to Vizcaya by the management in the Trip Advisor posts- not everyone is interested in visiting Vizcaya In closing, I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve been a Trip Advisor member for several years and once you get past the people who destroy hotels with their opinions because the didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t get an upgrade or one staff member treated them rudely, this is still a great forum. I take posts from people who have posted 10 or more times more seriously than single time posters\u00e2\u20ac\u2122. Most important is to Google Map any place you are looking at-especially in South Beach-I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve never seen so much trick photography to make a hotel look bigger or better located than I have when we were looking to stay in Miami Beach. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m glad we passed and we had plenty of money left over to enjoy the sights without breaking the bank.

To get to downtown, we would just walk across the street and catch the B bus (48 runs only on weekdays) to 14th Street, and then hop on the MetroMover to take us around downtown. To get to south beach, we took the aforementioned MetroMover to Government Center and got on either the 120, C, or S bus which took us straight there. We would spend most of our time outside the hotel anyway so it's location wasn't an issue. We went to Bayside, South Beach, Jungle Island, etc. and when we were done made our journey back.

We booked our honeymoon very last minute (day before we left) and really picked this hotel as a place to sleep and a base for our suitcases before our cruise and we really scored! Much more than a place to sleep........very helpful staff, happy staff who say hello and actually want to help you, fantastic pool area with lots of comfy loungers and tables, fire pit with armchairs at night, great rooms which provide pool towels and stunning art everywhere. We arrived and as we only had 2 days in Miami before our cruise we hit the shopping mall asap. Hotel advised the best mall, opening times and arranged taxi - we were sent to the Aventura Mall and hotel advised nice places to eat in the mall. We hit the shops but because the hotel resturant was nice we decided to return to eat rather then pick up some food court food. Huge burger and ice cold corona sitting by the fire pit at the pool was exactly what we needed after a whole day flying from the UK and a whole night shopping in the mall (we got this level of service even at approx 11pm)!! Bliss! Next day we were advised again by the hotel to hit Ocean Drive, where Dash Miami was and to head to Lincoln road after Ocean Drive for more shopping - all advice was briliant and we followed everything they said and had a great Miami experience! That night we challenged the hotel to find us a glam, fabulous place to have dinner and drinks as we were on our honeymoon! The receptionist called many many many places to find us somewhere who 1. was open on a sunday night 2.allowed non residents and 3. super glam enough. She kept in contact with us and she did not give up until she found us something! Great service! She found us the Delano and drinks by the pool at the pool bar. If you know Miami, you know what an amazing job she did getting us in there for dinner on the patio! Transfer to our cruise was simple and the hotel arranged a flat rate taxi to take us to the port - all hassle free! Thanks to the Hotel Urbano we had a fantastic honeymoon! Our hotel which started as just a place to sleep turned out to be brilliant and actually made the Miami 2 day stay before the 7 night cruise as memorable as the cruise itself!

While the accommodations and the hotel grounds were very nice, the service is absolutely and undoubtedly subpar. We had difficulties from the time we arrived. Our reservation, which we had booked a month before directly through the hotel website could not be found. We did have a confirmation number and after some searching, it was located. We were told our room was not going to be ready until 3:00 pm (it was 1100am) but we could check in and leave our luggage. They swiped our credit card and all but they did not assign us a room. We came back to the hotel around 1100pm and were then told that one of the rooms was ready, but the other was not. For the other room not being available, several excuses were given. The first that it was not in the system (even though when it was finally found I did not have to provide my credit card or information again); the second, that we had shown up too late; the third, that they had water damage to some of the double rooms, that they had to be taken off line and that I would be given a room with a king sized bed and a sofa bed. When I expressed reservations about this arrangement, the front desk person simply said I could come and see the room and if was not to my liking I would be free to then make arrangements elsewhere. Seriously, at 1100 o'clock at night!! No apology was offered for the fact that if the rooms were truly out or order, it should have been mentioned at 1100 in the morning when we first arrived, not at 1100 o'clock at night. We were left wondering if the rooms were indeed out of order or if our room had simply been given away to someone else. My sister voiced a more forceful objection and they agreed to comp our breakfast the following morning. Between her and I, we switched rooms so my party of 3 went into the double room and her party of 2 took the king sized room. Sunday, the day of departure we stood in line for over 20 minuted to check out. The same guy from Friday night was there. When we reviewed the bill, we found we were being charged for valet on the bill for both rooms. We had traveled as a single party in one car even though we were split in 2 rooms. We explained this to the front desk person who did not take our word for it, but made us wait in line again until someone from valet came to vouch for our information. Check out took close to an hour!! Frustrated, my sister and I voiced our concerns regarding the poor organization and lacking customer service. The front desk employee became argumentative, deflected responsibility and we almost had to tell him to be quiet so he would listen to some constructive criticism we provided regarding how to make check in more streamlined for the customer as well as how to improve their customer service and customer experience. Although this hotel has good food, a great location and is nicely appointed, we will not stay there again and will not recommend it.
