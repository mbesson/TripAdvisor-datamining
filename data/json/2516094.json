Parking spaces are limited. Once we got to the hotel, the desk service guy was rude. He did not attend to us for quite a wait. I believe my husband& i waited for about 5min until he looked up at us. All he was doing was texting. We checked into 2 non smoking rooms for the a night. We requested a room for disability because we had my parents with us. They're room was nice& spacious. Easy for elders to get in/out of tub. it was up stairs but no biggie. There was no problem at all with their room. When we checked in the room, it was nice, spacious, and it seemed to be clean. my room seemed to look tidy as well but once i lied on the bed, i notice a long strand of blonde hair. I do not have blonde hair i have red/black hair. I freaked and good thing the maid was right out my door. She was gladly to change the bed sheets, blankets, and pillows. Nothing else seemed to be wrong. However, do bring slippers. The carpet there is disgusting. Its so black and it smelled a bit. It is in a ghetto neigborhood and do be aware it is across the street from a hs. teenagers loiter all over the place. Dont let your guard down to be robbed or smoke blown into your faces. The door bolts are weak. the side of the doors looked like it be pried opened. But with our stay nothing happened. The pool outside was disgusting. the water was green. birds all over it. nasty. Its funny though, maids are consistency around the premises. hanging around in the laundry room. just saying. But they were nice to allow a customer to use the hose to wash his car. The promised breakfast. DO NOT RELY. the office was not even open until 11am (good thing they didnt charge for late check out. it was their fault for not being open). Oh and my mother left her traveling bag at the hotel. most hotels would call and let us know if we left something. Unfortunately, they dont care much for their customers. My mother didnt notice her bag was missing until the next day. i called in as ask for it they gave me a hard time and when i went to pick it up the same receptionist made me waited until he was done texting. in general you get for what the paid for. honestly would not recommend this place to anyone unless its only for 1 night.", "Date": "April 25, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Markham, Canada", "Title": "\u201cExcellent location, comfortable rooms, great front desk staff\u201d", "Author": "SoaringDiva", "ReviewID": "UR126921310", "Content": "We arrived at mid day and got the last Kingsize bed on the second floor which was very comfortable. Very good budget hotel. Two most amazing things.... location, location, location Sunset Blvd W just W of Highland Ave. Within 2 minutes you are on Hollywood Blvd. The second was the front office staff. He gave us a tour map and since we had a car we did the tour bus route that took us through Bel Air, Beverly Hills, Brentwood, Rodeo Drive and onto the Santa Monica Pier. Excellent afternoon. Circq du Soleil is on the Santa Monica beach - did not attend. Watched the surfers, fishermen (crabs & Lobsters) and the buskers performerances. We drove back, parked at the hotel and walked Hollywood Blvd. and checked the stars. Sleazy and just like Niagara Falls Ont type entertainment. The second day he gave us printed google maps to go to Universal Studios - what a blast... a must see in LA. The King Kong 3D show was amazing. Spend some time at Universal's Citywalk and mall and at night we visited the Grauman Theatre. Impressive but not exciting. The next day we spent on a drive through Griffith Park and checked out the Observatory. Need at least 1/2 a day on this activity. We were closest to the Hollywood sign and it is very visible. The view from the Observatory is incredible. Spent the night roaming the streets of LA and souvenir shopping. The only negative about Rodeway Inn.

The Rodeway Inn was just a few blocks away and about 1/3 the price of the Roosevelt, so I chose it based on other positive reviews on Trip Advisor. I have good and bad things to report about the Rodeway Inn. Let\u2019s get the bad out of the way first: my biggest negative is that this place is incredibly noisy! In all fairness, there is nothing they can do about it. It is located right on Sunset Boulevard, which is always busy. At night I became more aware of the constant noise caused by the steady scream of firetruck, ambulance and police sirens. How can there be so many emergencies going on all night long? Top that off with constant helicopters doing something overhead, idiots on motorcycles giving it full throttle to get to the next stop light, big throaty trucks that vibrated my room, cars with stereos so loud I could hear them in my room\u2026 well, you get the picture. Don\u2019t expect a nice quiet place to sleep. The shape of the motel may serve to capture and reverberate the road noise. Continuing on the topic of noise, the walls in this Rodeway Inn are very thin. About 12:30 AM the second night I heard the phone ringing in the room next to me just as I was drifting off to sleep. The guy finally woke up and proceeded to have a long, loud conversation and I could hear every word he said. About an hour and a half later some drunk person was banging on a door nearby, demanding to be let in. Ear plugs are a good idea if you stay here. I really appreciated mine. After a restless night you can expect either donuts, croissants or other sweet pastries as a main dish, little boxes of mostly sweet cereals, and milk, juice, coffee and fresh fruit for breakfast. On my last day the bananas looked like they had been up all night, too. They set it out once and once it is gone it is gone. It is served in the tiny registration office so you\u2019ll want to take it back to your room. The walls looked fairly recently painted and there was crown moulding on the ceiling, but the furniture needed replacing. One of my chairs had a big rip in seat. Now, on to the positives: it is an inexpensive place to stay in Hollywood. There are lots of restaurants and shopping nearby and you are just a couple of blocks away from Hollywood Boulevard where there is always something going on. It does have location going for it. Be sure to check out Off Broadway Shoe Warehouse just down the block. They must have the world\u2019s largest collection of shoes at discount prices. I bought three pair. After I checked in I asked to be moved from a tiny king bed room to a double queen room because I needed more space to set up a backdrop and light to shoot some interviews. They were accommodating about the move but charged me $10 more per night for the larger room. I have to say the person checking me in was friendly and helpful. My bed was comfortable and the maid did a nice job of tidying up every day. It surprised me that the toiletries included trial packages of Breathe Right Strips (maybe to help keep snoring noise down) and even hair goo for men, as well as a travel size tube of toothpaste. I suggest they also include a set of earplugs. They left ample soap and shampoo, but no lotion or conditioner. Towels and washcloths were standard issue. The bathroom was clean and had a nice size shower/tub. There was plenty of hot water but the water pressure was very low. My towels and bedding looked clean but they seriously need to clean the carpets. Every time I walked barefoot over the carpet and got into the shower I left dirty foot tracks on the wet tub. I spilled a little milk one day and when I tried to blot it up with a washcloth the washcloth turned black. So, if you have toddlers I\u2019d keep them off the carpet as much as possible. There is free, fast wi-fi and it is very easy to connect. There is coffee service, a microwave and a small refrigerator in the room. I had to disconnect my refrigerator at night because it became very noisy. The airconditioner worked well and was quiet. The TV is an older CRT model, not a flat screen, but it worked OK. There is a tiny work desk. There is no closet; only an open area to hang your clothes. There is a small swimming pool, but I didn\u2019t try it. They kept it clean. So there you have it. If you want to visit Hollywood and are on a budget, it is among the least expensive places to stay. They try hard to make it look nice, the maid service is good and the beds are comfortable. You\u2019re within a 5 minute walk of the center of Hollywood Boulevard, have lots of restaurants and shopping nearby. If you just need a place to sleep and can handle the traffic noise, it is a good choice.

Parking was available as soon as we drove in. There was about 4 vacant spaces and parking was free of charge (great!). The location is excellent. It is basically 1 block south of Hollywood Boulevard \"walk of fame\" and the theatres. This was great for us as it was in easy reach and a little quieter to stay at away from all people traffic of Hollywood Boulevard. There are some handy eateries very near by this hotel too. iHop and Mel's Drive-in Diner were great for breakfast and there is a handy In-N-out Burger across the street as well as a Pinkberry frozen yogurt a little further down the street. We arrived late at about 21:30 after a long drive. The check in staff were friendly, polite and prompt. They issued us with the electronic chip-type keys and explained the usual checkout and breakfast times. Our room (214) was on floor 2 with the usual open motel-style hallway. The 2 beds were very conformable, if not a little small for double beds. The room was a nice size for the 3 of us and very clean and tidy. There was great free Wi-Fi and an average CRT TV with some cable channels, but we didn\u2019t use it for much other than news/weather. The whole hotel and site looked like it had recently had a very good renovation, everywhere was spotless and decor was smart and tidy. The bathroom was very clean and smelt fresh. Free toiletries were also provided. The pressure of the shower could've been a little better. The in-room wall-mounted AC unit was a bit noisy and not too effective. There was a fairly small swimming pool in a fenced off area of the courtyard next to the car park. The pool water was clean and there were some patio chairs and shade on the poolside area. Great to chill out in after a long day looking round Hollywood. A complimentary breakfast was laid out in reception each morning 7am-9am. It was very handy to grab & go and included items such as cereals, apples, bananas, orange juice, fresh milk, fresh brewed coffee, cookies, croissants and a donut selection. It was handy to have first thing before heading out although I would advise collecting your breakfast early as it is pretty cleared out by 9am!

This hotel is in a very good location, about a 5 minute walk to Hollywood Boulevard where you will find the Walk of Fame, Chinese Theatre, Mini-supermarkets, Souvenir shops, Hooters and other bars and restaurants. It is however, quite a distance from the main bars on Sunset Strip and you will need a taxi as we found out the first night. We started walking and after 45mins, still could see no bars, so we flagged down a taxi and it still took an extra 10mins by car. (be prepared, taxi's are not easily available).

The location is great, although somewhat shady at nightfall. The inn looks like the sort of establishment a secondhand car dealer would bring a prostitute to on his lunch break. The thick pane of glass between guests and staff in the office was unnerving, and indicative of the safety of the area. At first glance, our room appeared clean. The television had poor reception (although this isn't a huge issue) and there were fridge and microwave facilities. The room certainly wasn't anything fancy, but was definitely adequate for the price. I was feeling very pleased with our decision in the morning, when we noticed something crawling across the bed. Upon closer inspection (and comparison with images on the internet) we discovered it was an adult bedbug. I caught the bug, and brought it down to the office in a cup. The guy in the office wasn't apologetic, but was fairly compliant in allowing us to check out early. I was assured I would receive a refund, and was told to go a couple of inns down the road to the comfort inn where they would 'look after' us. The guy behind the desk there was rude, and refused to look after our baggage while we returned the hire car. We have been pedantically careful about bedbugs, and fortunately had kept all our luggage zipped up on the tiled area. Irrespective of this, the next 24 hours (at least) was spent washing all of our clothes, and wiping down and brushing all our baggage. I realise that tourists bring in bedbugs, and this is not the hotel's fault. But the way in which the establishment deals with the infestation indicates whether the establishment is negligent or not. After checking in to another hotel (dont worry..we left our baggage outside, and cleaned all of it thoroughly!!) it took multiple phonecalls to negotiate a refund as the manager was never there. The woman I spoke to was very unapologetic, and told me they had 'inspected the room and found nothing'. I felt as though she was implying that I had fabricated the entire issue, and that they had no intention of treating the room. I dread to think of how many people's luggage could potentially become infested. I have since received a refund, although it is clear i will not be refunded for the night i stayed.

THEN we went to the bathroom. There was a GIANT hairball on the floor, there were short and curlies on the hand towels hanging on the rack, the tub was the blackest tub I had ever seen, and there were suspicious stains on the bed sheets!! We only stayed a few hours before checking out, and that was in the middle of the night!!! Later around 10 AM we went back to the hotel to talk to the manager about possibly getting at least some of our money back. The guy, was so indifferent to our complaints, offered up an incredibly weak \"sorry\" and wouldn't refund any money. It was as though this was a normal complaint there. I had even taken pictures of all the complaints and showed him; he just shrugged his shoulders and said he would talk to housekeeping to do a better job...like that was going to help us out at all!!!

I had no problem checking into the Inn and the desk attendant was nice enough to give us the option of what room we wanted to stay in. We stayed in room 215. We were pleasantly surprised with the room. It was a good size room with a king bed, mini fridge and microwave. It had a nice little table with 2 chairs. Although the room smelled a little musty, we simply opened up the window for a few minutes which got rid of the smell. The bathroom was adequate and large enough to allow 2 to 3 girls getting ready. The bed was comfortable. I was too tired to hear the outside noise but my girlfriend (light sleeper) said she was able to hear quite a bit of noise from the street. The Inn is right on the street so it's expected. The Inn had a small pool which was a nice touch if you have little ones. You have to remember that the Inn is small to begin with, so it was surprising to see a little pool. It also has a pool side table. The Inn is perfect for sightseeing and simply going back to lay your head. If you're planning on spending your vacation in a hotel, this is not the hotel to do it in. The room was great for the price we paid. We've decided that we will come back to this Inn if we're going out to Hollywood to have a good time. Although the parking lot is a little on the smaller side, there is a parking lot, which is a bonus.

It is located right on Sunset Blvd which is a very busy street 24 hours/day and the parking lot is cramped (they actually repainted the parking spot lines so that more cars could be cramped in and I was constantly worried that someone would knock the mirror off my car at night although that never happened). This is definitely not frequented by business people (I saw mostly construction workers and young tourists). When I checked in wearing my business suit, carrying my laptop, and asking for a quiet room, the guy at the front desk felt so badly for me that he gave me the keys to both of the available rooms and told me to see which one was quieter and whether \"the toilet works.\" That was nice of him but says a lot about the motel. The rooms smell like sewage, the bath tub and toilet were scratched up, and there was obvious dirt (even a footprint) on my bedsheets. There was a burn mark on the carpet in the shape of an iron and the furniture was filthy. This was when I almost left. But since it was late at night and I had an early interview the next morning, I stayed. The neighborhood is moderately safe (I felt ok as a solo female walking across the street to get a sandwich but I wouldn't go much farther than that) and, amazingly, you don't hear much street noise once you close the door and turn on the fan. I also went out and bought an air freshner to disguise the sewage smell. The free WiFi is pretty fast and I actually slept well all 3 nights there (despite sleeping fully dressed because I didn't trust the dirty sheets). Continental breakfast consists of doughnuts and coffee ONLY. Overall, I feel like I was lucky to have slept well at that place but I certainly would not stay there again.
