It had a lovely cosy element in the reception room where we were introduced to Bruno who works at the desk and is a true gentleman and an absolute delight to talk to if you ever get the privilege to meet him. Because the hotel has no carpets you do hear footsteps from other guests movements in their rooms or along the corridors, but this wasn't a major issue. The bathroom was small but extremely clean and well maintained on a daily basis. Our room was tastefully decorated in Venitian decor, but there was no tea making facilities. Breakfast consisted of breads, cold meats, cheese, cereals, fruit and hot bevereages. It's not possible to have a cooked breakfast, but we were snacking on local produce on our daily tours around Venice so we didn't let that become an issue. The hotel is situated extremely close to St. Marks Square but you don't hear any of the hustle and bustle from crowds outside, but the bell ringing from the nearby Basillica was a wonderfully unique touch to our first visit to Venice.

I believe that the dear older gentleman working this night desk's name is Bruno (?), and he was so helpful! He was born & raised in Venice and asked us if we wanted dinner recommendations. (On a previous trip to Venice, the restaurant recommended to us was pricey--though delicious). We took Bruno up on his offer, and let me tell you, you can't go wrong. Given the hordes of pricey tourist trap restaurants with poor quality, its often hard to find a really good meal for the value. Well, Bruno made reservations for us on 2 nights at 2 different restaurants in his neighborhood (where he lives, not works). It was a quieter, less touristy area. Neither restaurant was crowded but both were excellent...and inexpensive!! (I'll look for my notes on the restaurants later, but both places were waiting for us when we arrived and offered exceptional service, quality of food, and wonderful prices). It was great that we were off the beaten path. The second restaurant even made their own pastas, and the \"homemade pasta\" menu changes daily.

Good food and atmosphere at a reasonable (for Venice!) price. Location of the hotel is ideal - less that 80 yards to Piazza San Marco - and not much further to a vaporetto stage. As a general comment - budget an amount of money to take to Venice for your holiday - then double it - and you shouldn't have to try to find too many cash machines for the second half your stay.

The receptionnist seems nice at the arrival : you believe him to be a true Venetian, loving his city, and wanting to share all the things he likes in the city. So when he recommends a restaurant, by being held by a family, you go there thinking of it as being the true venetian restaurant, not the typical tourist restaurant. We went there, and it was as far as possible from what we thought it would be : a noisy restaurant, with techno music, televisions everywhere, ... On the good part, it is not expensive. But when the waiter asks you who recommended you from the hotel, you understand that the \"truly venetian hotel receptionnist\" is tipped for your choice of restaurant. So I would not recommend this hotel. On the other hand, I would recommend the far better Hotel Santa Marina, which is really cheaper (the nights were 100 EUR per night, compared to 160 EUR for the Firenze), and in a very calm neighbourhood, with almost no tourists.

But, if you're visiting this amazing City the location of the Firenze is perfect. You can see the domes of the church of St Mark and the Campanile di San Marco from the roof top terrace in St Mark's square. San Marco is less than a minute's walk from the hotel. When finding the hotel you need to be looking down at the pavement to spot the only obvious signs to it or look up above the shop fronts (we walked past it twice). The hotel is nothing special and the rooms are quite small (the bath in the 'bathroom' we had was more of a deep shower tray than a bath!) but if you get a room on the fourth floor you have the bonus of a private balcony. The decor is typically Venetian with tacky glass wall lights and pastel coloured painted walls, though the hallways and floors are done in attractive marble and everywhere is reasonably clean. The low point is definitely the breakfast. The fruit juice just isn't, and the coffee is undrinkable. If it doesn't come inclusive, go elsewhere! The staff were friendly and recommended two good restaurants: Vino Vino, which is at Ponte delle Veste (next to La Fenice Opera House) and does good lunches and has an excellent selection of wines, as you would expect with that name. The other was Ristorante Anonimo Veneziano at Calle del Fruttariol (near Teatro 'La Fenice'), which provided an excellent dinner for about 70 euros for two with wine. The owner (or head waiter?) is very welcoming and speaks excellent English. The other tip I'd like to offer is about the three famous, and famously expensive, coffee houses in San Marco - Florian, Lavena and Quadri. We only went in the later two and made the mistake of ordering regular coffees in Quadri, which manages to be wonderfully opulent and shabby simultaneously, as at 8.50 euros it was still just a coffee, albeit quite a good one. At Lavena (Wagner's favourite cafe, apparently) we decided to splurge on a 10.50 euro Cheri Cheri - a coffee with cherry brandy, amaretto, thick, thick cream and black cherries that were also soaked in kirsch, which was an absolute masterpiece and very almost worth the cost. In fact it was so good we had to go back for another the next day! I'd suggest you try any of their speciality coffees as I'm sure they are all equally as good. A word or warning though!

The Hotel is a smart little hotel in a very central location. It is spotlessly clean and the staff are pleasant and helpful. The mini bar is cheaper than the local bars and the room we stayed in was small but pleasant although at first we were given a room that had no window and was the size of a cupboard. Breakfast was a dissapointment as there was very little food and what there was left a lot to be desired. Small white rolls and processed cheese ! Also in the picrture it looks like you eat on the roof top terrace but you don't instead you eat in a very small dinning room on the first floor - although it is pleasant enough in its self. Overall not a bad hotel in a good location - so long as you dont mind staying in St Marco !", "Date": "June 26, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Swansea, Wales", "Title": "\u201cGreat location\u201d", "Author": "PostcardSwansea", "ReviewID": "UR7591262", "Content": "We chose this hotel for the location and couldn't have been more pleased - the only downside to being so close to San Marco was that it was sometimes a little noisy in the street outside at night. That said, it wasn't enough to deter me from staying here again. The ferry to / from the airport is no more than a five minute walk away. The whole hotel is small-scale, but our room was spotlessly clean, if tiny. The roof terrace is a great bonus - good for picnic lunches! We would have appreciated a lounge area as there wasn't really anywhere in our room to sit, although the breakfast room was available during the day Make sure you take a map and print off directions as it would be near-enough impossible to find this hotel's entrance without some clue as to what to look for.", "Date": "May 12, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "3", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "England", "Title": "\u201cHad everything we needed\u201d", "Author": "Rostler", "ReviewID": "UR5782019", "Content": "Very convenient for the Water bus from the airport.
