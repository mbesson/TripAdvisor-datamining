Liked their wines quite a bit as well. The spa is amazing and we had excellent massages and facials. The pool and spa area is large and was never full, although it was a beautiful day outside. We had Sunday brunch buffee at their Siena restaurant. Very good and reasonably priced, especially for a resort buffee. My only issue is that the beds are on the hard side. Also want to respond to the person who wrote on here that they aren't keeping up with maintenance, etc. Um, the resort is only 5 years old and looks great. The downside right now is that they are building a new wing. The construction starts early for a Saturday morning but then, that's why they were offering the amazing deal.

What a grand facility. Everything was perfect. We were treated like royalty. I cannot say enough. If you call him, my husband will not stop raving to you about how wonderful everything was. We live in San Ramon CA and have visited Hawaii, Arizona, Oregon, Anaheim, Donatello, Opera House, Fisherman's Wharf, Seattle and lots more of the Shell sites in the last 8 years, but this was the best. Just a 45 minute drive to the Garden of Eden and we are just now finding out about it. We spent the entire day on 03/30/2012 in the Spa. It was my birthday and we had a couples exfoliation, massage and lunch in the Spa with Victoria giving us great service. Francisco tended to my husband's every wish and the therapists were remarkable (Jennifer, Edith, et al). We spent 7 hours in there. All of the women at the spa front desk went overboard and killed us with kindness. Caitlin put together the couples package for us two days before on the phone and we were very happy with what she did. We went to dinner in Yountville at Bistro Jeantry and returned for room service by Ulrecht (from Haiti) who sang Happy Birthday to me in French and presented a chocolate cake with a candle that he lit. We had decafs with it (great coffee in the rooms, by the way, not any cheap stuff!) We went to sleep with a movie on one of five free Starz channels. We woke up to room service breakfast and went to Saturday 8:30 am Mass in the Chapel. What a splendid facility and the visiting priest from Chicago was so warm and caring. My husband did the readings to the sparse congregation. (Perhaps you could advertise it better in the hotel, as we were the only ones there for Palm Sunday Mass on Saturday at 5:30.) After morning Mass we went back to the spa for another day of lazing around doing nothing but sauna, steam, relax, massage, facial Bellisima, lunch, champagne, pampering, apples, tea, sauna, spa, relax. We walked back to the room in our robes and got ready for Palm Sunday Mass and then ate at the Siena. Rafael gave us fantastic service from 8:00 to 10:30 as he catered to our every desire bringing us appetizers and pairing wines to every dish. He was great and so was the food. The manager came by and talked with us and we complained about Yelpers together. We got a free DVD and popcorn from the front desk and had a nightcap in bed after spending time in the spa in the room. We had a hard time waking up on Sunday and finally made it back to Bistro Jeantry for a lunch from 2:30 to 5:00 and back to the Meritage when we realized that we had yet to visit a winery. So we went the the Trinitas on the property and closed the place down and walked back to the room for another night of DVDs, popcorn room service and heaven. The very best part of all: we hadn't been on vacation for a while, so we converted our points to Spa dollars and Dining dollars.

No staff at the front to greet or assist with check-in. The Front Desk Agent was efficient and provided a very good explanation of the \"resort\". The rooms were average. We found the beds uncomfortable as described in other reviews. The windows overlooking the pool were dirty (dirt, water stains, bird droppings) and didn't allow us to enjoy the view of the pool. Our room also provided us with a view of the back side of the property where the hotel GM and other staff members would stand and smoke cigarettes while they watched the construction project go on next door. One morning I watched the hotel GM smoke his cigarette, put it out on the ground, and then kick the cigarette butt into the flower bed. Nice touch. I know it was the GM because I saw him later in the stay and I asked the staff who he was. Back to the room; when set on cool, the A/C fan made a noise so we just slept with the windows open. Siena made for a poor dining experience. The staffing levels were poor (as stated in other reviews) and the service skills of the staff were worse. Unfortunately, we had the same server for breakfast two days in a row. Both days, she poured coffee on the floor as she wrote down our order. The spills stayed on the floor during the meals. On the second day, after our order was placed on the table, we asked for our check. The check didn't arrive until after we completed the meal and we had to ask for it, again. We had more poor service examples but these make the point. We planned to eat there more often but the train wreck service and average food drove us away. Try Mustards Grill in Yountville. It was awesome the 2 times we went. We also had fantastic meals at Cyrus and the Wine Spectator Restaurant at CIA. My wife did enjoy the spa treatment. In my opinion, they call it a \"resort\" so they can charge a \"resort fee\". It has a bar, a restaurant, and room service. It has a pool and a hot tub. There is a spa. However, most high profile hotels in large cities have these amenities and they don't call themselves a resort.

Except for really good tomato soup, the food at the restaurant was average though the price was reasonable so it wasn't all that bad. We were there on Groupon making it a really good deal. Full price puts it on the expensive side. Two problems. The first was a function of my expectations. I thought that since it was at a vineyard it would be charming. Instead, it was a bigger resort accessed through an industrial park. The second was we were told to go to the concierge for a free gift which was a wine-tasting pass for two along with some good information about the sights. It ended with an offer to sit through a time-share pitch. I am pretty good at resisting so they backed off but I did find it bothersome. Besides the normal wine-tastings, you may want to check out the Oxbow Market, a cool upscale food court. I liked the Venezuelan restaurant, Pica Pica.

What was frustrating is that we were standing at the desk for a fairly respectable amount of time and she did not acknowledge us.

Oh and Greg was not the only rude concierge (it seems like a pre-requisite to being hire there is \"do you hate people and life?\" \"hired!\") We came down around 5:30 to get the free shuttle and this lady is sitting in front of her computer, ignores us for a few minutes, this was our interaction: Us - \"Hi, we want to take the shuttle to downtown Napa for dinner\" Lady - \"yeah 6pm\" (doesn't even look up) Us - \"Do you recommend any restaurants? Lady - \"you don't have a reservation!!!\" (rolls her eyes) \"good luck\" (turns back to computer an ignores us. WTF! A helpful concierge would have told me about 5 restaurants that are great and then offered to make us a reservation. \"good luck\" lady this is your JOB! Added bonus, we checked out and had an extra room service charge on our bill. We didn't make the charge, and it took 20 minutes to sort it out. The guy at the front desk was nice and apologized profusely, but that the cherry on top of a dreadful weekend. If you are looking for fake charm, overpriced small rooms, an obnoxious client\u00c3\u00a8le and rude concierge service all in the middle of a parking lot and no where near anything in Napa (inspite the \"centrally located\" advertisement) then the Meritage is the hotel for you.", "Date": "February 13, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Salt Lake City, Utah", "Title": "\u201cA lovely weekend vacation\u201d", "Author": "mike f", "ReviewID": "UR124453086", "Content": "Such a wonderful spot and so close to SF too.

It is in a commercial area which is strange driving in, but once you're on-property it's fine. Our initial room was in the Merlot building. Gorgeous, spacious suite with an outdoor patio. Fridge, microwave, washer-dryer, the works. Only one problem. No Wi-Fi. Since the building is pretty new I am sure they will offer Wi-Fi in the future but no Internet access, for a business traveler, simply doesn't work. Long story short, we're moved to a new room in the main building. Nice-sized room, but no microwave nor patio. Great view of the pool, vines, and entrance to the Trinitas wine cave. And, with Wi-Fi, a superb room indeed. Side note here: the staff is phenomenal. Manny at the bell desk was not only absolutely helpful in bringing all of our luggage from one room to the next, he also was kind enough to go retrieve some toiletries I'd left behind in the first room due to not being able to focus because the fire alarm was going off inside the whole Merlot building (story for another time, but it wasn't me. Honestly). The bar in the main building (don't know if it has a name, just off the lobby on the left-hand side), true to form, provided excellent service. Our server was there whenever we wanted to order another round, or dinner, but never hovered. Nor did she appear so busy that we were forgotten, and the place got pretty busy as the World Series was being broadcast on the telly above the bar. Room-service breakfast: we each ordered the Eggs Meritage. Like Benedict, but atop a disc of polenta. Again, great staff interaction - they were friendly to a fault and let us know exactly how long it would be before our food arrived. Great folks you have, Meritage, hopefully you pay them well. Breakfast was good - not phenomenal, but overall 3 stars. The Trinitas wine cave: there was a special business function in the wine cave where three local wineries were offering tasting - the cave is gorgeously lit and very cozy, considering its size. Great venue. There was a special dinner afterward for thirty folks (no invite for me) and the long table, set with snow-white linens, glistening flatware and glassware and gorgeous tapered candles looked striking. What an amazing spot for a special dinner! Perhaps next time... Room-service dinner: I ordered a green salad, Steak Frites and Jack Daniels bread pudding. Green salad: good stuff - mostly greens, few beet chunks, few halved cherry tomatoes. Nice light dressing. Steak Frites: holy hell. Gooooood stuff. I am a meat elitist and turn my nose up at anything that even hints at fat and gristle. This hunk 'o' meat was perfectly prepared, sliced, and honest to goodness, I completely cleaned my plate. The frites: thin, perfectly cooked, some were translucent in all their glory. Wow. The only disappointment was the bread pudding. On the dry side, it could have used about 5x the sauce. I tasted apricots. I tasted good bread pudding egginess. I did NOT, however, taste Jack Daniel's. Anywhere near the plate. No hint of bourbon warmth, nothing whatsoever. If I'd know I was going to get plain old bread pudding, I would've gone with the chocolate. Argh. I know that dessert can be iffy for a kitchen as it is overall omitted from the meal, but for those of us dessert-lovers, it can make or break the meal. It is, literally, the last thing your patrons are going to taste before they leave your restaurant and as such, it needs to be \"holy-crap-I-want-to-wallow-in-this\" good. My bread pudding was lacking. Things to keep in mind: this location is not Napa-proper. It's south of the general \"Napa\" area and not really centrally located to anything other than the industrial park. That said, these folks did a great job with the location they chose. From our third-floor room, the view is nothing but big, azure pool, wine cave, and vines as far as you can see.

From the start we had problems...On our first attempt to make reservations, my husband was put on hold and hung up after being on hold for more than ten minutes. We both have little patience for businesses that do this, but still went back for more. While on trip advisor\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s website, we clicked on a link that offered deals for The Meritage, called the number provided and once my husband realized he was not speaking to the hotel directly, he politely explained to the person on the other end that he would prefer to speak with the hotel directly and would call them, this person said, \"F_CK YOU\" and hung up on him! Now we realize the hotel is not fully responsible for this, but this is a company that makes reservations on their behalf, which means that they are representing the hotel. After all of this we still decided to make reservations. While speaking to the reservationist we were put on hold once again, for her to verify that she could match the price that we saw online, normally this wouldn't be a bother, but it took a while and if you are the reservationist on regular basis, this should be something that you are aware. We check in without incident. That was probably the most pleasant experience. The first morning of our vacation, we are awakened at 6:30AM, by a chirping battery from the smoke detector. It is very frustrating to be awakened that early while on vacation. The hotel is responsible for staying up to date on the maintenance of smoke detectors and such. Food at the hotel bar was bad at best. Worst of all, the concierge desk was downright rude and unfriendly. One thing that I thought was unusual is that when you entered and exited the hotel, they would give you direct eye contact but not speak, unless spoken to and unresponsive to a friendly smile. This is in direct contrast to what I accustomed to from a concierge desk! All these minor things on their own would not have been a big deal, but when you add it all up, it makes for a less than desirable stay. In the end I complained to the manager on duty, who was pleasant, but somewhat full of excuses. We were given a fifty dollar credit, of course to spend back at the hotel, which I have mixed feelings about.

Arriving late in the afternoon we got there just in time for the free wine tasting offered in the wine cave at 5 pm. Along with the wine tasting was unlimited amounts of gourmet cheeses, fruits, and crackers. It appeared as much tasting as one would like to do was accommodated. Back at the room we were given a wonderful bottle of red wine that is now one of our favorites and we will look for this wine for purchase in our home state. Two bottles of complimentary water are left in the refrigerator for guests each day and valet parking is free (or should I say included in your $15 a day resort fee). Our room was lovely, every inch decorated beautifully and not one speck of dust or anything out of place. Our bed was comfortable and the pillows just right! The furniture was lovely, the closet and bathroom space were more than ample. I particularly loved finding this hotel is savvy enough to accommodate women by providing a wall mounted magnifying make-up mirror in the bathroom- WOW. We opted for no view thus had the new building under construction outside our window but we weren't in our room much and we didn't hear any particularly unsettling noise from it. I LOVED getting up each morning and walking the paths around the vineyards and my husband found it easy to use the business center with free internet. The food in the restaurant was very good, we had my daughter's rehearsal dinner there and everyone was very happy with our entrees, especially the sea bass. The downside if any is that the gorgeous but very large wooden doors used to enter the double sinked bathroom shower area and then one more to enter the private commode area seem a bit in the way but doable to work around. I was confused why the shower fan was in the private commode instead of the large room accommodating the shower and it came on everytime one used the commode and it was loud enough to be annoying for those brief moments. To keep the bathroom steam free we left the bathroom door open to the bedroom area. I would stay there again in a heartbeat and would recommend it to friends. The shampoos, soaps, and lotions provided were butter based, very nice. It is only a short drive to downtown Napa and on into the wine country. The office park setting made zero difference to staying at this resort other than entering through it to find the resort. Some of our wedding party stayed next door at the Vino Bello when the Meritage became sold out and it was lovely too.

Although the photos make it look spectacular, its in the middle of an industrial park, far enough away from the luxuries that Napa has to offer, however the hotel does run a shuttle service until 10:30pm @ night. When we arrived, we were told to see the concierge for our 'welcome package'. This 'welcome package' was actually a sales pitch for a timeshare option and if we joined a 90 minute meeting, they would give us a trip to Hawaii, etc. We thought it was a totally bizarre way for them to start us off at the hotel. No directions were provided as to where anything was. Room was spacious but we didn't realize it until the next day that they had booked us into a handicap room (which we didn't need). The shower and the makeup mirror were oddly strange heights. When we attempted to call down to discuss, we were kept on hold for almost 10 minutes and finally when someone answered, we were told a manager would speak with us...it is now day 3 and we still haven't heard from the manager and we've been to the front desk 3 times to complain about other issues we've had here. The customer service is lacking - although they are courteous and willing to help, they never actually resolve anything at all. We had booked a car service for the day and when they arrived to our hotel, they were told that we were not listed with the hotel as guests. When we discussed this with the front desk, again we were told management would get back to us and still nothing. They did offer to look into changing our room and suggested we pack up our stuff before we were to head out for the day, but due to the staff suggesting to our wine tour service that we were not registered here, we were unable to gather our items before we left since we were late. Also every time we tried to call the concierge from our room, we were directed to another guest's room who was getting call after call looking for the front desk. Obviously some glitches they need to work through. If you want a hotel that caters to large conference groups, this is the spot to go to. Its a nicely decorated Holiday Inn. With so many places to stay in Napa, keep doing your research unless you're into this kind of hotel. Not worth the value - spa is grossly over-priced and they also charge a resort fee daily which, given there are no immenities that warrant it. They even charge an additional fee of $25 to use the water therapies at the spa - which is a joke. Although the spa is nice, the writeup of what is available makes it sound over the top. This is a hotel posing as a resort. Don't be fooled. The beds are also lumpy and way too soft. When I went to the spa for a massage, my therapist told me that the number one complaint from guests is the mattress and poor sleep due to terrible mattress quality.

We finally settled on the Meritage Resort and Spa, as it looked very nice and wasn't going to break the bank. I have to say that the setting of the hotel was not exactly what I expected. It is located in a quasi-industrial area just off the highway and is a fair distance from downtown Napa. However, the hotel does offer a free shuttle to take to you and from Napa (until about 10 pm). The hotel itself is very nice, and rooms were spacious and modern, with comfortable beds. We were given a complimentary bottle of wine, which was a nice touch. Additionally, they offer complimentary tea and coffee in the lobby, which is nice if you need a little pick me up throughout the day, There is a lounge and a restaurant on site. The restaurant served a very good breakfast and dinner, however they seemed very short staffed every day we were there. Our breakfast took over an hour to get two days in a row and the people at the table next to us (who arrived before us) never even received their food at all. The staff were very nice and were extremely apologetic about the wait, even reducing our bill by 50%, which we appreciated. One thing I took issue with was having to pay the hotel's mandatory' resort fee'. This hotel hardly qualifies as a resort in my opinion. The pool, while nice, is nothing special and there were few other amenities to warrant this charge. That being said, there is spa and a wine cave that does tastings on site. There is also a trail behind the hotel that winds through a vineyard and looked as though it would be a lovely walk, however it was closed the entire time we were there, which was disappointing. C'est la vie! The hotel seems to host quite a few conferences, and I think it would be a great venue to hold meetings.Staff was very friendly and helpful, and our fellow hotel guests were lovely as well.

We booked through Hotwire for a fair price (after the taxes and resort fee are added). Upon arrival, Jonathan at the front desk informed us we were being upgraded to a deluxe room with patio. I asked about the huge construction project going on next door and was informed they don't commence work until 9 AM. When we arrived at the room, we realized were assigned a double queen with a balcony overlooking the full construction project (now wondering what we would have had if we were not upgraded). A couple minutes after our arrival at the room, Jonathan at the front desk called and asked what we thought of the room. I informed him that I thought we would be assigned a king bed as I am 6' 6\" and a queen would not work for my wife and I. After being on hold for a couple minutes, he stated they were out of king rooms and reiterated that construction does not begin until 9. Jonathan informed us the concierge had a gift for us.

It appears the Hotel is lacking in overall management and Customer Focus. Here are examples of why I say this. On the first night went to the lobby bar to have a drink, waited over 20 minutes without even an acknowledgement of the bartender. And the bar only had about 5 customers in it. We left and drove into Napa to get batter service. Spent over $ 400.00 at the Spa, the attendants in the dressing rooms were great, however no hot water in the showers and only comment form front desk we are working on it and we will take a little off you bill, still have not seen that. Went to the restaurant for breakfast, waited 10 minutes to be seated, again very few people eating at tables most of the tables were empty but still had dirty dishes on them. After being seated took 15 minutes to get have our order taken, then another 30 minutes for the food. This was a simple breakfast not full meals. Service very slow and not customer focused. We decided to go to the wine tasting room. All over the hotel were notes (even on the room key) go to wine tasting 2 for 1 if you are staying at the hotel. The next day I noticed out invoice and they changed us for two wine tastings. I went to the front desk to ask about this and the front desk said\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd I can print your invoice and you can walk over there and ask them why they charged your wrong\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, once again lack of customer focus.

Rooms with beautiful views of the vineyard, people relaxing by a luxurious pool, and sipping wine while playing Bocce Ball. Well don't let that fool you, the Meritage is nothing of the sort! Those pictures were taken at cleverly placed angles to make you \"think\" you're looking at a spectacular place to get away. The truth...It is nestled not in a valley, but in a business park! There is a \"small\" vineyard on the back hillside, but above that is a highway, and to the side of the resort is another highway. On the entrance side, your view is of the business park and powerlines! Upon entering our room, the first thing I noticed was the worn carpet. Beyond that was a basic room...nothing that made you feel \"special\". The complimentary bottle of wine that came with the room was simply placed on the counter next to the coffee maker and ice bucket with a presentation that was no different than a complimentary bottle of water. As I proceeded to the window to see our \"view\", my heart sank. Our \"view\" was the end of the parking lot. Beyond that was an ugly, fenced construction site, complete with a green fence, bright yellow temporary power poles, a dirt lot, heavy equipment, and a new building under construction. Beyond that was the business park, and several large satellite dishes. If we craned our necks to the left, we could see the end of the vineyard, and the cars passing on the highway above. In conclusion, if you want a quick place to stay en-route, or a quick place to stop with the kids, this would be fine. But if you are looking for a romantic wine country experience...don't bother!

I have visited Napa/Sonoma about 6 times and all I can say is that there are many other places to stay with more character that will give you a truer Napa experience. As another reviewer points out, the hotel is located in an industrial park and has the feel of a Hampton Inn or Holiday Inn from a distance. I was immediately put off by the location and surroundings. All I could picture was tourists getting off a big tour bus ooohing and ahhhing. Once inside, the hotel is definitely clean and nicely decorated but that's the problem - it feels like it was overly orchestrated by a decorator and doesn't have any real charm. Basically it feels like a big conference hotel that's trying to be a small cozy Napa hotel. The room was small and when we upgraded to a room with a view for $20 more, we were given a corner room with a high wall that blocked our view (and that was also covered in bird poop). We asked to see another room and while the front desk was very polite and accommodating in showing us other options, a similar room with a shared balcony (thanks but I don't want to share my girls' weekend with strangers) did not suffice so we stayed put. Thankfully they agreed not to charge us the $20 although they certainly tried. The good thing is that if you're in Napa you're hopefully not spending much time in your room so if you're just looking for a place to sleep and not spend a lot of money, this hotel would be fine. One of my friends did use the spa and said the massage was fine and the surroundings were also just \"eh.\" The pool looked clean but we never did sit outside b/c we were too busy visiting wineries. Linens and such were fine and there was a bottle of wine in the room (also just \"eh.\") but that didn't stop us from sampling it one evening. We did have the brunch on Sunday morning b/c it was easy but there are definitely better places for breakfast. It was fine but I wasn't overwhelmed. So I guess one's enjoyment of this hotel depends on what kind of traveler you are...if you like a hotel with character and charm nestled in the heart of Napa this is not it. If you're a wide eyed traveler easily impressed by overdressed hotels located in industrial parks then this would likely impress.
