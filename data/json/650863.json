Since season starts around Easter. I made a reservation well in advance for 4 days on their website for a price, I would have been easily been able to get a 3 star in the same neighborhood or a 4 star a little far. My reasons of booking this place: - Good reviews on Tripadvisor, usually Tripadvisor has helped me pick the best hotel all the time with reviews from user, however this time not sure what happened. The place turned out to be useless based on the kind of reviews found on the website. - Distance from Termini, YES! this hotel is located around 200-300 meters from Termini station, whereas there are many (actually too many) other hotels in the same neighborhood which are byfar lot better than this place. - Both the receptionist (one in morning, other in evening) don't speak or understand English at all. It was nightmare communicating with them. - Wireless connection has charges 5 Euros per day and you'll have to come down to the reception area in order to access it, so you cannot actually access it from your room, since there was no network on third floor, not sure if that was the case with other floors too, however that is what the receptionist told me. - Complimentary Breakfast: I don't know what to say, all I can say is there's nothing for free and its nothing special here too and no buffet don't get excited when you see that word. Rest of the things about elevator, etc. has already been mentioned by other people. I would highly recommend not staying at this hotel please, since you have lot of other better options.", "Date": "March 23, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Edinburgh, UK", "Title": "\u201cGreat budget hotel, plus breakfast in bed!\u201d", "Author": "DavidandBrigid C", "ReviewID": "UR121909179", "Content": "Great hotel near the train station. The hotel is old (everything in Rome is old!), but really comfortable and a friendly staff. They opened a bottle of wine for us when we forgot our corkscrew. The shower was clean and had really good water pressure. It's on the small side, so if you're overweight, you will have to wriggle through the doors. The internet is an extra 5euros/day, but worked well. And breakfast! It's delivered to your room every morning at a time of your choosing (between 7-9) ... not big, just a croissant and a drink of your choosing. We had two croissants, a cappuccino, and an orange juice delivered at 8am every day (for the two of us). I never thought I'd have breakfast in bed at a budget hotel, but it was great. We stayed on the 1st floor (2nd US), so with the windows open it's a bit noisy. But the hotel is equipped with soundproofing windows when they are closed. With the blackout shades, we could have slept 14 hours if there weren't so many nearby sights to see.

I did not find apartments as an option on the major travel booking sites, but you can book it on their own web site. It was a spacious apartment with a large bedroom (we asked for two single beds), a living room area with dinning table, spacious bathroom, and kitchen area. It was nice to have a refrigerator during our stay. They brought breakfast to us at the time we asked and it consisted of the type of coffee you want (cappuccino, espresso, americano etc...) and a croissant and cookie things. It was so nice to wake up to a fresh cappuccino arriving at your door. We had air conditioning that worked great. The staff was very helpful.

It\u2019s old, rooms are tiny, staff speaks english only a little, and some of them doesn\u2019t seem to speak english at all. And all of them can forget english if then want - when I wanted to pay my stay with credit card on check-out, I\u2019ve been told, that they had \u201cproblems\u201d with it. And a woman on reception suddenly stopped to understand english. So I had to pay in cash and spend almost all of my money. So-called \u201cbreakfast\u201d is a small cap of moderate coffee with a croissant and two tiny biscuits. This breakfast is very poor even for Rome, so the first thing we did after this \u201cbreakfast\u201d was a visit of a nearest cafe or McDonalds. As I already said our room was very small, there were no enough space even for our bags. Of course there wasn\u2019t safe box in room, but it was possible to leave values on reception desk. There wasn\u2019t air-conditioner in the room and a fan was almost broken, so I had to fix it first before using. Bathroom was very old with some strange equipment for saving water, so it was almost impossible to use toilet if nobody was in shower before it. And a shower cubicle looked like it was elder than me. Location is great, there is subway station near the hotel and It\u2019s close enough to railway station. Some attractions are close to hotel and you can easily reach many of famous places on foot. But the street in which hotel is situated is VERY noisy. From early morning and till late night you can hear great noise from number of restaurants, music, sounds of cars and motors. And it\u2019s impossible to close windows because of absence of air-conditioner, so you\u2019ll be slipping into oven. The only good thing about this hotel is it\u2019s price, so you could choose it if you don\u2019t want to spend a lot of money, but only if you\u2019re going to Rome in winter. I strongly recommend to avoid this hotel in summer.", "Date": "September 26, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cExcellent location, very nice hotel\u201d", "Author": "Marco_aragno", "ReviewID": "UR114744148", "Content": "The hotel is excellent! \u2013 friendly and helpful staff, nice rooms and awesome location!
