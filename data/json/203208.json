First of all it is very small hotel, very hard to find - tiny sign and at the time we went - covered by some sheets for renovation. it would be OK if they put some sings outside covers. but the issue for us was the water. if you want to have a shower you have an option boiling or freezing cold water, there was no way to set the water temp - very annoying. next thing - the noise. the hotel is located at the corner of 2 very busy streets, and all night and day the noise was really tiresome. you would need earplugs. rooms are tiny - but you can cope with that - at the and of the day you are outside. breakfast - OK, nothing special - croissant, bread roll, some spread cheese and jam, tea or coffee. there is air conditioning but it didnt work (november in rome is quite cold) but i would assume that in the summer - there could be a problem with it - looking at all facilities i dont give them much credit. so location - good and the rest - not so much.", "Date": "November 25, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "1", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Montreal", "Title": "\u201cHard to find worse\u201d", "Author": "Filipo76", "ReviewID": "UR10520608", "Content": "Stayed at Luxor for 5 nights.

The Luxor does not compare. The air conditioner is very loud and the hotel is off a very busy street so expect a lot of noise during the evening. Our room was on the 2nd floor and when we woke up in the morning our room stunk of smoke. We went to check out and discovered the night desk clerk was smoking away.

The restaurant recommendation we got from them was so great we ate there 3 times! They arranged for an affordable taxi to the airport in the early morning hours.

Hotel Luxor is well located, just off via Nazionale. Only 5 min walk from Termini and about 15 min walk to Trevi Fountain. The hotel room that we were given was very clean. The bathroom was spotless with lovely large soft white towels which were replaced every day. However, it was TINY. If you are a large person, do not stay in this hotel or you will be unable to use the toilet / shower facilities. The front desk staff were very friendly and helpful. However, we found it a little strange that the hotel could not provide an iron for use in the room. The breakfast was awful......we only went the first morning. It wasn't worth returning to on the subsequent mornings. Stale bread rolls, orange/pink coloured water instead of proper orange juice, tiny little ramekin bowls instead of proper breakfast cereal bowls, luke warm milk instead of cold milk for cereal. I can't comment on the coffee but the tea wasn't great....but that's a general problem in Rome rather than in this hotel. There's a \"despar\" grocery shop across the road on Via Nazionale....buy your breakfast supplies there :-) I found our room to be noisy. I could clearly hear activities in the adjacent room and the traffic on via Nazionale. There were a lot of channels on the TV but none in English....not even CNN!! Would I recommend this hotel? Well, that depends. It's location suited us perfectly and it was clean. It's expensive enough for what you get.....I wouldn't have considered it a 3* hotel.
