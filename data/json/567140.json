We were in a non-smoking room, but the adjoining room apparently was smoking. The beds were small and very uncomfortable. Free internet. Positives: Ten minute walk to the main train terminal Very low price Elevator Free Internet Very Clean Good neighborhood - lots of restaurants nearby Negatives: Small room Small uncomfortable beds We decided that we would be out of the room most of the time, so we would sacrifice comfort for location and price.

Nearby to good food, able to join bus tours, etc. The people around the neighborhood were not too bad, a few gypsies but otherwise I generally felt safe.

The elevator is manually operated, you must open and close the doors by hand, then only press the button once everything is ready. It was sometimes quicker to walk up 4 flights of stairs, but I enjoyed the novelty. The hotel can be hard to locate for the first time, you need to press the doorbell to get inside (extra security is OK with me) Check-in: The staff were a bit rough, but still helpful. Quick check-in Room: Small room. Air conditioned, but difficult to use. There are no blinds on the window, only a big solid shutter (ie either completely open or completely shut). This is probably just a \"Europe\" thing, I hadn't been to Italy before. The room smelt of cigarettes when I first arrived, so I left the windows open for a while which cleared the smell quite quickly. There was ample space around the bed for luggage. Not a huge room, but big enough for me. The bed wasn't too comfy, you get what you pay for... No noise from outside, very quiet. Facilities: None Breakfast: None included. There was food nearby, so this wasn't a problem. Tours: The tours offered through the hotel (brochures in the room) were very expensive, but on par with other tour companies.

I am not very demanding with hotels when I travel for tourism cause I don't spend a lot of time in the rooms, but there were a series of disappointments with this one that forced me to write this negative review. I hope I am being fair, it's nothing too bad, but I think travellers need to have a real expectation so as not to be disappointed as I was. - First problem is that I called them before travelling and asked the receptionist if they had wireless internet available, he said they didn't have it in the rooms, but that I could bring my laptop to the reception area and there I would be able to connect to a wireless network. That led me to bring my laptop in the trip which is always a hassle cause it's quite heavy. When I went to the reception with it in the first night, I saw two secured networks, asked the receptionist which was the hotel one (X or Y) and the guy promptly said 'it's X'. Then I asked him what the password was and to my surprise he said 'I thought it didn't require any password'; I asked him to check that information with some colleague or support, and he crankily replied: 'no, no, i have no idea what the password is and there is no one I can ask about it too, no one knows. I'm sorry I can't help you'. I found it funny and asked about the network and password to another guy, who was there the day after. Then he was clear from the beggining, that the hotel didn't supply any network, but that some people have already occasionally managed to connect to some unsecured network that was available by chance in the hotel area. Well, I found it all funny but if you think about it, it is extremely unprofessional of them to tell the costumer that they did have a network in the reception area. - The rooms: we had the bad luck of getting a smoking room which had a very strong and unpleasant stale cigarrete smell. The furniture was not new, as I read in another review. The room was small, with a tiny wardrobe, some yellow stains in the walls and even a small brown stain in the bedlinen. The floor is tiled, which makes it cold and there were no mats. - The bathroom: the shower had a drainage problem forming an unpleasant pool with water coming back from the drain, and the toilet seat was loose, detaching from the wall - everytime I sat on it, it creaked and I was afraid it would fall off the wall - and I am not a big person! - Internal noise: despite being turned to the back of the building and not on the main street, our room was extremely noisy, because there is no acoustic isolation between the room door and the hotel public area. The result is that although we were not next to reception, we could hear interphone and phone ringing, people talking, people walking on the tiled corridor, and even the cleaners would start their work early in the morning (8) and wouldn't spare guests from all sorts of noises like plastic, buckets, brooms, hoover, etc. - I didn't have the guts to get into the tiny and ancient elevator of the building, so if you don't fancy that as well prepare to climb three floors of stairs. - Finally, the breakfast: it is literally one cup of coffee and one tiny slice of sponge cake (I've attached a picture). If you want anything more in the bar, which is next door, you have to pay for it, at reasonable prices. I find it misleading to say they serve any kind of breakfast. It would be better for the hotel not to create any expectations regarding this because it is a bit shocking (you could see the look in everyone's face - 'but this is all'?!). Maybe the only thing I liked there was the location, because it's kind of close to termini station and has nice family restaurants in the area (there is one called 'Trattoria La Famiglia', which I highly reccomend). But the hotel has no signs outside and it took me about 15 minutes circulating the area trying to find it! All in all, as I said I don't give much importance to hotel rooms especially cause I usually travel for tourism and on a budget, but I think it is good to have the right expectations. Unfortunately based on the experience I had I wouldn't reccommend this hotel... I think it is worth it to pay some extra 20 euros and find a better place.

In the building, the Castefidardo hotel owns the third floor and another hotel, Lazzari, the second. The hotel is renovated, new furniture, clean bathroom, all that on 1 star hotel. The room was great, right across the front desk. Not very big, but ok, windows above the main street which was noisy but the windows were soundproofing. The TV was small and had just Italian channels. The bathroom was very clean, so was the room. Everything is new. The man at the front desk was an old funny man, he was helpful. The hotel has no internet, but there are some cheap internet points nearby. A quite big supermarket at 1 minute walking distance. Many restaurants around, but not all of them so good. watch out in Italy for coperto&services, they are both tips put on the receipt. Rome is a big city, that's wy for the colloseum and the roman forum you must use the public transport, but the hotel is close to the termini railway station, where you can find metro and bus stations. The hotel is close to the Trevi fountain and the spanish steps, also Piazza della Republica.

Since I bought the travel day pass, I took bus to the hotel (one stop from Termini). It would be better to ask people where the hotel located because the hotel was on the third floor of a building. No big sign of the hotel. Castelfidardo shared the same building with hotel Lazzari. We booked for Castelfidardo but we stayed in hotel Lazzari (5th floor). As the lift was old type, we climbed from first floor to third floor because the last user didnt close the door. Breakfast was not good.

The owners were very quick to answer emails before we arrived, and were friendly when we got there. Different story a few days after we left and discovered we left a couple of items of clothing in the wardrobe - no reply to our email, but that's travel, I guess!
