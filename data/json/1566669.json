NOT RECOMMENDED!\u201d", "Author": "Felix K", "ReviewID": "UR127547913", "Content": "PLEASE pay attention to other reviewers! One good thing from this hotel is the receptionist, Mr. Ahmed. The others thing are totally minus! I can truly say, that this is not hotel, but HOSTEL! The information that is written are not completely true. I traveled there with three friends, and according to the information, which I received by phone call, that I will get family room, with one big bed and two single beds. We got picked by one of the worker, Mr. Murat, who is acting friendly, but fake. They took us to the hotel and we met the friendly receptionist, Mr. Ahmed. All of sudden they said that the room are full and they transferred us into another hotel, which is also the part of AST Hotel. They said, that it is a new building with new furniture. We arrived there at 1 in the morning and we agreed to move, since we were very tired and need to sleep. The location of new hotel is quite far and we had to walk. The building is located near the vile area. And we saw that the building is not ready yet to be occupied. No internet connection, the floor is dirty and full of sands, the TV is not working, no BREAKFAST and the view is HORRIBLE! The more minus thing is that they gave us one room with one king bed size and one single bed and they suggest all of us to sleep there! We are not a PIG! We pay for it! And we have argued with the porter, and he is not very polite and really disrespect the guests! And to solve the problem that night, we decided to get our money back and find other hotel. But they offered us to add more room and it is used only for a night. We disagree and told them that we will move in the lunch time and still we asked for our money back. But suddenly we got information that we can stay at the main hotel at the lunch time. At 10.00 in the morning the porter knocked our room and asked us to get out, because the room will be taken by other guests. This is one of the prove of lack of service and hospitality! We argued and we left the hotel at 12.00 as agreed. Once again we met Mr. Ahmed, and with his smile and hospitality he welcomed us to the room that we order. The room is nice but the toilet is horrible. The water works very small. The view is horrible and you can not see the sea view as it is mentioned on the information. The breakfast is only bread with jams and coffee or tea. Then at night, the General manager of the hotel, Mr. Reis Tastan, talked to one of my friend with high tone in front of other guest at the lobby. He complained us, by making trouble. WOW! He is totally BLIND that his hotel is like a pig's cage! Dirty and smell awful! He argued with us and one really disrespectful thing is he insisted us to go out from the hotel. But we disagreed since he won't return our money! Shortly, I DON'T RECOMMEND you this hotel! But if you enjoy wasting your energy by arguing with stupid porter and general manager, they will welcome you. And one more thing, at the time I was checking out in the early morning (05.00), I saw three guests are sleeping on the couch. I believe that they experienced the same problem and they did not get the room! But yes, I have to say that Mr. Ahmed is really nice guy with pure heart to help people there! And yes, don't order airport shuttle from the hotel. order it at the agency near the hotel. The hotel will charge you 20 euro, while the agency will charge you only 5 euro!

Also it is ideally situated for all the city sights, walking distance almost everywhere. The breakfast is very tasteful and nicely untill 11 am., so you dont have to hurry in the mornings.
