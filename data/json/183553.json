This hotel was chosen for our group otherwise, after reading the TA reviews prior to our stay, we would not have stayed. There are good reasons that over 50% of the the TA reviews for this hotel are rated average or lower. The property is dirty on the outside and this trend continues into the interior of the hotel. The stairway from the underground parking upwards is one of the filthest I have ever seen in a Canadian hotel. The walls are dirty, the carpets copiously stained and the doors and door jams are disgusting. The hallway walls are dirty and beat up. Each of the rooms we stayed in (2 different rooms on 2 different nights) were dirty. Grimy fingerprints everywhere. Carpets that feely sticky. Hairs in the bathroom and shower. You just get a general feeling of uncleanliness and neglect. We looked at several other rooms that our group had and the problems are consistent throughout. The building and rooms are not properly maintained. Doors do not close or lock properly. Spackle coming off the ceilings. Water stains on the ceiling. Fridges that rattle throughout the night. Shabby furniture. Peeling wallpaper. The walls are paper thin and if you do stay in a 1st or 2nd floor room you will hear the folks above you. The hallways have uneven tile floors and the sound of any pulled luggage resonates throughout your room. We did not have the breakfast the first morning we were there but were aware that we would be leaving too early to have it. You may be able to get a bagged breakfast if you request it the evening before. On our second morning we did go into the restaurant and unfortunately, though some of our friends ate there, we would have gone elsewhere. It was just not an appealing place to eat. The morning that we did take the shuttle the airport the bus was nearly 20 minutes behind schedule and was full enough that it left a group behind at the hotel. I suspect that the shuttle is a 3rd party contractor so this may not be a fault of the hotel but if one is staying at this property for the shuttle you may need to be reassured that you will be able to get to the airport when you need to be there. Upon our return we arrived at 1 am and were aware that the shuttle was not operating. The cab fare is $15, with tip, from YVR. In previous experiences at other hotels in the area they will reimburse you for the fare. This was not offered to us. It does provide reassurance that there is a night watchmen, but the fact that they need one is disconcerting. One of our group had their vehicle broken into and a bag taken from the truck and a second bag was misplaced in another room while our friends were at breakfast. We have stayed at several other YVR area hotels and both the Holiday Inn Express and the Accent Inn offer similar amenities (free parking, shuttle, breakfast) at a similar price in a much, much different environment (clean, friendly, well maintained, safe, secure) that really this property should not be on your radar. It truly disappoints me to have to write this review but honestly this is a very poorly run hotel and the problems we experienced were too numerous to discuss with the front desk staff or management. In good conscience, and as a service to fellow TA readers and contributors, we would not recommend this property to any one, especially since there are many other excellent choices in the immediate neighbourhood.", "Date": "April 19, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "2", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cNo shuttle.

Location, shuttle service, cleanliness and choice of room styles was excellent. However, we found ourselves shaking our heads in confusion at some of the things we encountered. Begin with the highlighted \"wine reception\". I chose the hotel for the proximity to the airport, but the \"free wine reception\" swung my decision to the Executive Express. So, we checked in, rooms, as I say, were fine--lots of room for the four of us, and the included breakfast meant we would get away for our flight well rested and fed. Hmmmm. So, at the appointed hour, we wandered down to the lounge/restaurant and.....found it locked. So, we sat in the patio for a few minutes and eventually an awkward server turned on the open sign and let us in. We told him we were there for dinner, but could we also participate in the Wine Reception. He became a bit flustered, because the kids couldn't come into the attached lounge. He bumbled about for a moment and decided we could sit near the lounge, and he could bring us our wine. Okaaaaay. Then came the best part of the advertised Free Wine Reception. It was determined that we would both like red wine, which provided a choice of merlot or Shiraz. We chose the Shiraz, which turned out to be our bad luck, as.....they were out of Shiraz. So, from a 1/3 bottle of merlot, he squeezed two small glasses. Awesome. Then we placed our dinner orders,, and THEN,and only then, did he tell us the chef hadn't turned up yet. By now, we really would have preferred to pound our free plonk and gone elsewhere, but it seemed like the awkward server had really bonded with us, so we stayed put, the chef showed, and a really mediocre dinner was not enjoyed by the four of us. One other table of perplexed diners came in later, and the rush was almost enough to do the awkward server in, but he prevailed. He did confess to us that he wasn't a server at all, just worked at the hotel to help out his aunt and uncle. He was certainly pleasant, and he turned up on time' unlike the chef. The next morning, the awkward took a drastic turn to downright uncomfortable. Our awkward server was obviously at his day job, leaving the service of Free Breakfast in the hands of a brusque elderly Asian woman, who did such bizarre things as lock the door (yes, we had to knock, and another customer got up and let us in). As it was not apparent how the breakfast worked, the lady would yell \"I bring you sausage egg and toast, no menu!! You sit, I bring!!!\". Well, bring us juice, coffee, scrambled eggs and sausage, she did, as well as toast and jam, and for a free breakfast, it was good value. Fortunately, we got in and sat at a clean table and got our free breakfast. Those who came after us were not so lucky. No tables were being cleared, and by the time we left there were no less than 10 people waiting. Angrily. We thanked the harsh lady and made haste for our shuttle to the airport. Do book a room here if the rate is less than others in the area, or if you require a spacious/family room. Do not chose this site for the Free Wine reception or the Breakfast.", "Date": "August 3, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Location": "3", "Rooms": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cPoor service and even worse sleep\u201d", "Author": "Yelram", "ReviewID": "UR115377088", "Content": "The hotel staff were not overly helpful or friendly; the room smelled like old cigarettes; the bed and pillows were uncomfortable.

Great reception and very polite, gave us our room before the check in time, and others that arrived (not related to us) also got given their rooms early. The room was lovely and clean and had exactly what I requested, microwave and a fridge as I have a toddler who needs his warm milk first thing in the morning and last thing at night, very cosy, no noise, overlooking the car park and beyond, so I could see my friend arriving to see me off on my last day too which was great. The restaurant meal and service at dinner time was better than I expected too, had a lovely healthy dinner, and am looking forward to having my breakfast there tomorrow. My friend was also impressed with this hotel which is also nice to look at as you come in. Overall, I highly recommend this hotel, great value - only cost me $71 for the night plus tax which is not much, including b.fast, and for what we got plus the exceptional service, I have no idea why others complain via the reviews on here, but can only put it down to the fact that some people are never satisfied with anything and will always complain about something. While some of us appreciate a great service and here you get exactly that. The internet is only $5 for 24 hrs, though there is free access to a computer as you come in at the reception area too, well worth it. I also noted the airport shuttle arrive just outside the entrance of the hotel, very convenient, it does not get easier than this, and was told it comes every 30 mins from 4am to midnight, but get downstairs 10 mins beforehand to ensure to get on it when it arrives, can not be more fair than that, the shuttle to the airport is also free with the hotel booking.

It's the worse hotel condition I've ever had. From the pictures on the website, it looks so luxury and worth while to stay, but when you get there, it's totally different. There is only 1 elevator for the building and it is old; actually 'old' is not a big problem but it works in a weird way and it stinks.... that matters! The elevator always go down from Lobby (or the upper floors) to the basement (parking lot) before it goes back up. It is the type of elevator you could picture from the 60s-70s. Other horrible things include insufficient lighting and noise. There is no carpet installed so whoever walks with a suitcase and when there are people/teens running in the hallway (which happens everyday during my stay in both the morning and at night), you'd wonder if you ARE in a hotel or in a community center. One last thing I wanna talk about is breakfast. The receptionist just told me that it's included but when I got to the lounge in the morning (where he directed me at check-in), there were nobody and nothing you can related to 'breakfast'... so I just left and went somewhere else. There were no signs or information about any services so the only reason to stay at this hotel is to have a bed and a room to sleep in, that's all!! don't expect there is any service... this word doesn't exist or mean anything for this hotel...

This is in a city where smoking is not allowed in businesses. Then, I was told that they had no record of my reservation. I had forgotten to print out my reservation before I left the house so I asked if they had WIFI so I could look it up using my laptop computer. They did not have WIFI so I was told I could pay to use the internet kiosk and look it up there. I had no other choice but to pay to use their internet kiosk. Once I had retrieved the reservation number, the person at the desk tried looking the reservation up using that. I was told once again that there was no record of the reservation. At this point, a group of people walked in, smelled the lobby, and loudly complained about the smell before leaving to find another hotel. The person at the desk asked what the rate I had booked was. I told him and he looked at me like I was trying to steal from the hotel and reluctantly agreed to honor it. I was given a key to the room and went to find it. The room was on the third floor. The halway outside of the room was completely unheated (so it felt like it was outside) and it was January so it was really chilly. The hallway also smelled like a gym locker room. Fortunately the room did not smell bad like that and was heated. However, the bathroom was not very clean - the toilet had some dirt on the seat and there were hairs in the bathtub. The room was very big though and there was a kitchen in it which was great. I had booked a park-and-fly rate so I could leave my car parked at the hotel while I was away. At some point while it was parked at the hotel, someone tried to steal my car by trying to pull the lock out of the door. They almost completely destroyed the driver's side door with a crowbar.

The management simply shrugged and said they weren't responsible, and they had no insurance to protect us.", "Date": "February 10, 2004"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "2.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Hamilton, Ont.", "Title": "\u201cI had a horrible time..........\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR1557058", "Content": "Unfortunately, my vehicle was stolen in their open car park overnight. The carpark is quite dark, not properly lighted and hence a very decent spot for thieves to break in. And security there was very loose. In fact, the night I stayed, another car got broken into. The most problem I have was the security guard didn't take my case seriously in the morning nor did the front desk which made me really upset even more. The bed I slept on really needs to be replaced. I would say if you stay here, be sure not to drive your own vehicle there.", "Date": "January 19, 2004"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Executive Inn Express Richmond", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g154943-d183553-Reviews-Executive_Inn_Express_Richmond-Vancouver_British_Columbia.html", "Price": "$79 - $126*", "Address": "<address><span rel=\"v:address\"><span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">9020 Bridgeport Road</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:locality\">Vancouver</span>, <span property=\"v:region\">British Columbia</span> <span property=\"v:postal-code\">V6X1S1</span></span>, <span class=\"country-name\" property=\"v:country-name\">Canada</span> </span></span></address>", "HotelID": "183553", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/ProviderThumbnails/dirs/65/33/6533544b30680835fff946fa27e81cb85large.jpg"}}
