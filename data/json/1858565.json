Unique and beautiful interior with above average service. Room is very clean and spacious. Location of the hotel is not bad, only a few mins walk to metro station (if you are going to Universal Studio, the easiest way is taking the metro heading North Hollywood direction for 2 stops and there is free studio shuttle tram taking you to the theme park.) and about 20 to 25 mins walk to Highland Center and Kodak Theater. Be aware if you book their Highland Flats type room, you will be sleeping beside a night club and you WILL hear and feel the music base all night long. My husband couldn't fall asleep till 5 in the morning for the first night and he had to use ear plugs for the other two nights. If you are a light sleeper, spend more money and book the more expensive room that is facing the court yard instead. Also there are no view from this room type. We are on the 5th floor (the top floor) and all we can see from the window and balcony is the concrete side wall of the night club next door. Another complain I got is the water pressure of their rain shower head. the water pressure was so weak that i feel like I can never wash off the bubbles on me. The kitchen inside the room is amazing. There is an actual stove you can cook on and the pot and pan are all prepared for you. Living room is large and comfy, and I love the turntable record player. We played it every night before sleep and in the morning when we were getting ready. This is our first wedding anniversary trip and I wish it could be more perfect, but sadly the night club ruined it for us.

The room: Very nice, the room was as it appears in the photographs, large and roomy. The bed was soooooo comfortable as was the bedding and pillows. The bathroom was large as was the shower, but there was too little pressure in the rain shower head that the water barely dribbled out. I did ask for the room to be away from the nightclub nearby, but we were situated on the same street and it did get very noisy late at night, not so much from the music but from the clientele of the club outside while lining up to get in and when leaving the club. We had a balcony which faced Vine Street and a view of Capitol Records. A continental breakfast was included in our booking, but not worth it as it only included a coffee and a piece of toast or a muffin. There is a house car which we took advantage of for a trip to Universal Studios and a trip to the open air mall. The staff: The staff were nice, particularly Ellis who was lovely, very helpful and obliging and very polite. Location: I was concerned at the location before booking as it was a 10-15 minute walk to most hotels and restaurants and all the action but booked anyway based on reviews that the distance was no biggie. The 15 minute walk did grow a bit old very quickly, particularly after walking and touring all day and then venturing out again for dinner. More particularly at night when walking back and there were a couple of undesirable looking groups of people wandering about. Place to eat: 'Wood and Vine' just down the road on Hollywood Blvd, food is great. Place to drink: 'Five 0 Four' bar on Hollywood Blvd Tip: Take one of the open topped van tours around Beverley Hills and Rodeo Drive, a bit kitschey but a lot of fun Conclusion: While we liked the Redbury, I probably wouldnt stay there again, I would probably look at the Renaissance Hotel or the Roosevelt Hotel for a more central location for convenience only.", "Date": "March 30, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "St. Louis", "Title": "\u201cFantastic rooms, pleasant , but confused front desk\u201d", "Author": "glu", "ReviewID": "UR126944061", "Content": "The Redbury is perfectly located at Hollywood and Vine!

The valets were the nicest, most helpful young men, especially when we misplaced our cell phone. The front desk staff was extremely pleasant, but were clueless regarding the package we had booked. We are part of the I Prefer group-which is the reason we chose the Redbury. The front desk totally bungled our room type, our rate, our included breakfast, and early check-in/late check-out benefits. After several different clerks, and multiple phone calls, it all was fixed, but exhausted us. Then our room had a broken clock, broken safe, a non-functioning deadbolt, and a set of blinds that fell on my son's head. Room service was noted to be 24 hours, but you could not order your breakfast the night before. And when we tried to order at 7 am, no one was in to take the order!?! Our food arrived promptly, but without napkins. All of this was fixed with each front desk call, but we began to worry that the hotel was more focused on the trendy look, rather than good service. After the first 24 hours, the remainder of the stay was without a hitch, until the bill came and charged us for our free internet. It was promptly corrected.

It's probably one of the most unique hotels that I have stayed at because it was a converted apartment building and our studio suite was a very spacious 750 square feet. The kitchen area was cool but we really didn't have any use for it with such a short one night stay. The bed was very comfortable and we were still able to get a good night's sleep even though our room was facing a building that was a nightclub. When we got to the room at 2 in the morning, the club next door was still going strong. The music wasn't too loud so we were able to fall asleep pretty easily. The bathroom was very nice as well. The shower was spacious and had a rain shower head, which was very relaxing. Suprisingly I also made use of the washer/dryer combo. I had some clothes to wash and I was able to get that done. The room service was very fast and the food was good. It was probably the fastest that I have seen.

Huge high ceilinged suites with marvellously decadent decoration and a four poster bed. Each room is equipped with a vintage record player and a selection of albums! The kitchen is beautifully equipped and the bathrooms are great. Each room also has a spacious balcony.

Of course all this comes at a price (overnight parking is $37!) and the rooms come at around $320-$350 a night, but in a way it is excellent value for money and nothing here is done on the cheap. There is even a washing machine hidden away in one of the cupboards. The one draw back is perhaps the noise. Avoid the rooms that give onto the club next door on the North side. On my first night there was a live concert going on until midnight. Luckily it was a great concert which we enjoyed without having to pay for tickets!

I got the 2 bedroom suite and boy was is huge! Its true... size does matter. But not only was the size of the room amazing but the decor was chic. Leather sofas, flat panels in every room, king and queen size beds that were ultra comfortable. The record player was a nice touch but was skipping when I first turn it on. I quick call to the host desk and they immediately sent someone to fix it. Service. Service at Redbury is probably the highest reason why I was so please with my stay. I am not a night owl nor do I know any hollywood nightlife. So I relied a little bit on the hotel on their recommendations. First of, they recommended a restaurant called Saint Felix, which was absolutely fabulous, when the restaurant below couldn't accommodate our party. Then knowing that it could be difficult to get around and get in at some of the venues, I again turned to the hotel hosts (one of which was TJ who was the most accommodating) and ask for suggestions and they gave me some recommendations and they made some calls and they got my group in with serious VIP treatment. My boys were out for a good time to spend a night with a certain gentleman who will be taking his vows to be with the woman he loves.

The staff at reception were always friendly and helpful. Susannah was so kind at check-in and really made us feel at home straight away. Now to the best part of this hotel, the rooms! they are definitely some of the largest, most spacious hotel rooms I've ever stayed in. They have an apartment feel to them, including a full, modern kitchen, retro lounge, balcony, open bathroom and huge shower with great amenities. We stayed on the 2nd floor, and the balcony just looked out the wall of the building next door, but we didn't mind as the interior was so amazing, we mostly just stayed inside anyway. The nearby nightclub was a tad noisy one night but was just as expected for staying in Hollywood. The bed was amazing! Probably the most comfortable bed in all the hotels I stayed in across the U.S. Lastly, Cleo, the restaurant on the ground level was fantastic, great staff, unusual but fantastic tapas style food, very cool, classy, hip crowd. Loved eating there! Would highly recommend this hotel! Its worth the money if you want the space and the experience of staying in a very arty, new, clean and luxurious Hollywood hotel with fantastic apartment style rooms.", "Date": "December 17, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "new york city", "Title": "\u201cRocker-Chic Hollywood Hotel\u201d", "Author": "fashionlvr", "ReviewID": "UR121830041", "Content": "The room is very spacious and beautifully decorated.

We even had guests over for pre-dinner drinks and appetizers and all were impressed with the hotel and room. The washer/dryer is very slow but I did a wash load every night and switch it to dry during the day. We had freshly laundered clothes daily and no pile of laundry to do when we got home. There is a very chic/cool vibe to the hotel. They have a phonograph with an assortment of LP 's.....i really enjoyed that. Very centrally located for shopping, dining and sight seeing. My only 2 complaints are the room service was not up to par with a luxury hotel, and my room was facing a night club which was a bit noisy.

The location is great for Hollywood - walking distance to a number of bars, restaurants and tourist spots. When entering, it can initially be a little confusing as the restaurant is on the ground floor and hotel check-in is up one level. Once I found the reception desk I had a smooth and courteous check-in. I also started to notice the atmosphere around me -- everything is dimly lit with lots of dark wood and interesting artworks. It's like being in a Scotch-sipping private members club of yesteryear. I read that a renowned photographer helped design the place and it shows -- the lighting is perfect! My room (The Hollywood Premiere Flat) was also pleasantly different. It's designed like an apartment, complete with open-plan kitchen, washer-dryer, large four-poster bed and lounge area. There's a walk-in shower and large vanity area. The balcony has a nice view. My favorite touches included the very-well stocked kitchen (food and alcoholic beverages amongst other things) and the old fashioned record player with its assortment of twelve-inch records! Basically, it's the most perfect hotel room imaginable to host a party - which is what I did! The rooms also have very good sound-proofing - you couldn't hear the faintest murmur of my party from outside in the hallway! I would most certainly stay here again.

Within walking distance from Chinese Theater, Roscoe's Chicken and Waffles, Metro Red Line, great trendy restaurants and many more. My husband and I really didn't need a car during our stay here. We stayed in the Vine Flat with a view of the Capitol Records Building. The room was very comfortable and a nice amenities. I liked that there was a kitchen so we had a place to stash our leftovers from any restaurant we ate from. I also liked that there is a washer and dryer. I didn't get to use it but is very convenient. The bed was ridiculously comfortable. I felt like we were sleeping on a giant fluffy cloud.. AHHH! The TV had DVR and some premium channels... awesome! The only awkward thing about the layout of the flat was the shower. I think its kinda odd that from the bed you can see a blurry outline of the person taking a shower on the other side of the wall. It's okay if you are with your significant other, but what if your staying with some friends? If you want to take a shower, you would have to turn on the light in the shower. The problem with this is that if there's someone sleeping in the bed (on the other side of the shower wall) the light shines brightly on them. All in all, I totally recommend staying here. The staff is very friendly and the housekeeping rocks. I do recommend staying on the higher floors for those who are light sleepers. It did get a little loud at night with the late night crowd roaming the streets. You can hear all the conversations on the street even when all the windows are closed.

HORRIBLE Management!\u201d", "Author": "Fieryembers", "ReviewID": "UR118841917", "Content": "I originally wasn't going to write a review about my customer service experience...just ways the hotel could improve...but because I still haven't received a response to my email to management I'll have to post it all here. I stayed at the Redbury for an entire week at the end of April so I feel like I got a good feel of how this hotel works. I vacillate between anger at my horrible customer service experience and actual ways the hotel can improve so this review will try to be as levelheaded and fair as I can make it. I hope that the good and bad will be taken as ways they can improve their service in the future! Let's start off with the good! The Good: -Beautifully decorated and huge! A real rock star meets old Hollywood vibe.The smallest is 750 square feet! The bed was soft and comfortable! -There is a DVR in each room so I was able to tape my normal shows and watch them in my vacation downtime! -Location Location Location! It is a one minute walk to the Hollywood and Vine metro station and only a block away from Trader Joe's! -Delicious smelling lotion and shower gel! The Bad: The Cleaning Crew. The maid service times were very sporadic! One day it was finished by 10:00 am other days it hadn't been started by 4:00 pm. I'm quite sure my sheets were not changed every day and the last three days I was missing a top sheet! Other than that the one time I was in the room while she was cleaning-she was efficient and courteous. Individual Coffee Machines. -I understand these are popular nowadays...but really! A six ounce cup of coffee had been almost drained by the time I went to enjoy it on the balcony. I know I used at least 3 coffee pods every morning. A coffee maker would be a lot easier and much more economical! Speaking of coffee... I requested splenda and coffee pods everyday from the cleaning staff (underneath the note I left a generous daily tip) and everyday it was ignored (even though they sure didn't forget the tip) LOL I had to go get the coffee pods myself from Cleo and the front desk every few days. Just a suggestion... only having Bold and Decaf is not the way to go! There are entirely too many flavors to only offer sleepy time tea, decaf and bold coffee! The Bathroom -The rain shower is nice and all if you don't mind the lack of water pressure but the water never got steamy hot...more like luke warm. (I was in 312) -The sink is one of those really sleek flat ones that looks like it needs to be a prop in a sexy commercial. It's completely flat with small beveled edges.Would have been perfect for doing a line of coke in a music video. Not actually conducive for washing your face or brushing your teeth! My room not ready or properly checked! -The day I checked in they hadn't itemized the room properly and as I was unpacking two men (they were quite apologetic) came into the room to check out the minibar and such. -I had to return a DVD that someone had left in the DVD player. There was a vinyl record missing from one of the covers and an open bottle of your water sitting one of the end tables by the couch. Technical Issues! -The lighting system is ridiculous! Every night around 3 am the pot lights over the bed would come on and wake me up. I finally figured out how to fix it...after almost a week of staying there. Not to mention you need a diagram to keep track of all the light switches and what they turn on and off. At least 4 different sets in the kitchen and living room alone! The DVR and remote is way too complicated to work-and I'm a bit of a techie. It's one of those universal remotes and it's just confusing! (see picture) No Car Service as stated on the Website! -The car service...(one of the reasons why I booked The Redbury) was not available. That was a bit annoying but I was told that they would give me a voucher for a cab. Not exactly what I was hoping for decked out to the nines to go to a red carpet event but I didn't have much of a choice. Well I gave them the time and date I would need the cab and I get to the front desk and when I arrived they had no record of it. Sigh:( Luckily the cab company was \"right around the corner\" and it literally took a few minutes to get to Graumans theater but I ended up paying for the cab myself. The floor to ceiling Windows must come with a disclaimer! -Just a note for the single traveler and non exhibitionist couples...The white sheer shades that filter light so beautifully during the day...are completely transparent at night. I realized (around day five) (when the hotel filled up a bit more) that I could see entirely inside the rooms across the courtyard from me. Like everything! Yes, I'm talking to you certain couple. If there was a light on at all-I could see straight into the room. Please let people know that they might want to draw the black out drapes at night in the rooms facing the courtyard. I wish I would have realized this before traipsing around my room in my underwear or reenacting the entire end scene from West Side Story. (don't ask) A Billing Snafu Times Two (or Three) -The staff tried to charge me twice for internet access even though the terms of my booking offered \"FREE INTERNET\" -It took three weeks and a call to their billing department for them to release the 1050 (150 a day for a week ) hold on my card. They were apologetic about it but the excuse was that \"sorry that week hadn't been batched out properly\" -My last billing issue was the straw that broke the proverbial camels back! The Management! UGH! I was locked out of my room on a very early Saturday morning after being at a film fest for almost 16 hours. Long story short. (lol too late?) The manager was rude and treated me like a criminal. I told him that I had been billed that previous Wednesday for the entire amount of my stay (almost 1800 dollars total) and that I had checked my credit card balance that morning like I always do. He said their computer system didn't have any record of it and asked to see proof. (Really? Wow! What happened to the customer is always right?) I had to call my credit card company at 1:00am for them to say... Yes, I had been billed the full amount even though the hotel's computer was showing otherwise. The manager wasn't even apologetic! One faulty computer system and a very tired and embarrassed me later.... I finally got back into my room. The next day I considered leaving-but I figured the refund would be more hassle than it was worth. I even saw that same manager coming out of the Cleo restaurant the next day and he just looked right through me. The management was terrible, and if that situation had been handled with a bit more finesse I wouldn't have left with such a bad taste in my mouth! I expect MORE customer service at a smaller boutique hotel... not less! That manager really cast a pall on what would have been a lovely vacation and first time to Hollywood. On the bright side...all the front desk attendants were nice as they could be. I just wish things would have been handled differently! Well, that was my honest Redbury experience. I still have yet to receive a return email from management which makes me think that due to the amount of glowing reviews they just don't care about the few people who really had some major customer service issues! I hope this is not the norm and I my email was lost or something. Hope you can make an informed decision from this. Customer service is paramount to me so as a consumer you have to decide if style is worth more than substance! The bottom line?

And the Vinyl player in the room was especially cute. The bathroom had a very large shower and again, was very clean! The room also had a huge kitchen and washing machine & dryer. Now, to the cons. DO NOT, I repeat, DO NOT get their basic room. On the first visit, we got a room with the capitol record view. It's pretty much a view of the street which was fine for us. We loved sitting on our balcony and watching the passing traffic and people. However, on our second visit, we decided to save some money and get their basic room. What a Big Big mistake. The room faces a dirty alleyway, opposite a concrete wall which appears to be the outside of the club. Not only was it super loud, it was also very smelly on the balcony. Our room is probably not even a couple of meters across the concrete wall which makes the whole place feel depressing and claustrophobic. We desperately wanted to change room but the hotel was fully booked. So we sucked it up, kept our curtains closed day and night and checked out the next morning. Service: The service at The Redbury was very mediocre. The workers weren't rude or anything but they didn't seem to make that much of an effort. Other: The valet parking was expensive, but I think it's like this in most hotels in LA. We had Japanese room service on one night, small quantity, very average food and extremely overpriced! There is also no fitness centre on site. i think you can get a free pass to a public gym which is very inconvenient. Location wise, I think it was great for us (We are in our early twenties) but it's definitely not a place for family with kids or people who just wants to relax. It can get a little bit dodgy at night. Overall, the hotel didn't wow us.

Our one-night stay at The Redbury met our requirements with some caveats. We're glad we tried it. CITY GRIT: Accept that in this part of Hollywood, you're always within six giant steps of something grungy. Between The Redbury and scrumptious Juicy Burger or the Pantages, expect to step in a little pee and expect a couple of requests for a buck or a smoke, both within acceptable levels of city gritty. That said, even if you didn't book a view room (see CHEAPEST ROOM), you shouldn't have to expect in-your-face grit when you sit on your balcony. It felt like we could reach out and touch the adjacent Avalon, with its crumbling fa\u00c3\u00a7ade and stinky, noisy ally. Hey, Redbury - how about collaborating with the Avalon for a quick pressure wash and paint job? No? How about something well within your means to mitigate: (1) Add two more privacy panels to the two already hanging on the balcony and (2) clean up the pigeon poop on the balcony floor every now and again. CAB-RIDE CLOSE: This is a terrific base for concerts and theatre. The house ride was available when we were ready to head out to a concert at the Greek. Superior. GOOD NIGHT'S SLEEP: No complaints about the mattress or linens, nor did we experience the noise others did, possibly because we stayed on Sunday night. The too-low lighting and the bed's platform\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 not a match made in heaven, and I have the bruises to prove it. Redemption came in the form of superb quality blackout curtains on the windows and roller blind on the patio door. Nighty-night, sleep tight! CHEAPEST ROOM: Having booked the smallest size suite AND requesting super-early check-in the morning after a sell-out, I got exactly what I expected (thus the ugly balcony scene). The great thing for the budget-minded is that but for the balcony and square footage (ours was 700+ - who needs more?) the experience (amenities, service) is pretty even across the board. Queue up a little Dark Side of the Moon on the easy-to-use turntable, crank up the AC and the well-positioned ceiling fan, poke through the ample snack baskets, and settle in for some pre-event R&R. Every staff interaction - with valets, house car driver, front desk staff, barista - resulted in engaged, efficient service. NOVEL VIBE: With the exception of the front entry area and Cleo, this is a relentlessly dark space, with deep browns, reds, and blacks competing to dominate dimly-lit public spaces, and in so doing, hiding some really nice appointments and people (gosh, sorry, didn't see you sitting there in your black t-shirt on that brown couch under that 10-watt bulb). And where was the genius hand that dressed Cleo when it came time to do the suites? You know your suite is dark when even the long expanse of butcher block, glossy white kitchen cabinets, and crisp white bed linens can't make a dent. Unmitigated murk is a novel vibe, and we enjoyed it for a little while. Try it for a night.

Major kudos to my gorgeous valet my last morning who, after SuperShuttle left me high and dry, got me a taxi very quickly to get me to LAX.

One quick subway stop to Hollywood & Highland, where there is shopping, Grauman's, and the shuttle to the Hollywood Bowl (major reason I was there), and I hear the buses running along Hollywood Blvd will take you basically just about anywhere you want to get to.

Although not ideal, this was something that we could have handled as we could draw the sheer drapes and not worry about the view... We weren't planning to spend too much time in the room during daylight hours anyway. What we couldn't handle was the nauseating stench of cigarette smoke that gave me an instant headache. I specifically requested a non-smoking room when I booked our reservation, and when I called down to ask to switch rooms I was told that this was a non-smoking hotel, but that if we came back down they would get us switched to a different room. We then lugged all of our stuff back down to the front desk, never once offered a bellmen or any assistance with our baggage, and were given another key to a room on the 4th floor. \"Ok, whatever... Shake it off!\", we were thinking. We had dinner reservations and then tickets to a show after that. We just wanted to enjoy the rest of our one night stay in LA. We had reservations at Katsuya, which is literally a half of a block from the hotel, and also owned/operated by the SBE group. Dinner was great, but we regretted not having dinner at the Redbury's own Cleo restaurant... We heard nothing but great things about the dining experience there. Anyway, the rest of our night was great. We returned to the hotel around 11pm. We were happy, tipsy and ready to pass out. The beds were extremely comfortable... Beautiful pillows and linens. The rooms have a very homey feel, set-up more like an apartment than a hotel room. We fell right asleep and got approximately 2 hours of great sleep. Unfortunately, this was short lived as we were awoken around 1:30am by the loud thumping of music. We turned the TV on to try to drown out the music and eventually fell back into a restless, unfulfilling sleep. We were up at 8am the next morning kinda groggy and ready for a good coffee and hearty breakfast, but were again disappointed to find that the hotel didn't really offer much more than a continental breakfast. We decided to just pack up and check out... We'd grab something to eat at Waffle's which is great and just a few blocks away. So, upon check-out we were giggling because we saw one of the guys from the Travel Channel show \"Ghost Adventures\" which I like to watch before going to bed at night. He and his wife, with newborn baby in tow, were complaining to the front desk because he said that someone came into his room at 7:30am to take stock of the records for the record player in the room. He thought it was highly unusual and very disturbing at that hour. The girl that was helping us check-out was listing to their conversation and inadvertently re-charged us for our room, which was already paid for in full. Whatever - She apologized, reversed the charges and we were outta there. In short, the Redbury is in a great location, right off the 101 on Hollywood and Vine. It has a hip, funky vibe with dark crimson walls and giant illuminated pictures of starlets from the 40's and 50's... Not my style, but I'm sure it would appeal to others. The rooms are large and equipped like apartments with kitchenettes and washing machines. The restaurant, Cleo, is said to be very good. The layout of the hotel is kind of bizarre... No real lobby besides a cut-out of the wall at the top of the stairs. The staff and level of service is lacking, but I do believe that they have potential. Would I recommend the Redbury to a friend? Not MY friends. There are many kinks to be worked out.", "Date": "March 7, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "wisconsin", "Title": "\u201cVery Hip!\u201d", "Author": "mom2teenagers", "ReviewID": "UR98107008", "Content": "Very spacious room with kitchenette!

I hate almost everything about that vapid city. Unfortunately, I work in TV so that necessitates travel to Loathe Angeles several times a year. Double unfortunately, we mostly have to stay in Hollywood. That being said, the Redbury makes all those things more than bearable. First off the rooms are huge. We stayed in the smallest room available and it was 750 sqft. Giant kitchen, living room and a super comfortable bed with awesome sheets. The hotel itself is trendy and super designy but not in an obnoxious way. The hotel staff was friendly and helpful making us feel right at home. We normally stay at the W Hollywood across the street and while the rooms are nice there, the hotel as a whole is so sceney and obnoxious that every time you walk in the door you have to show your key and the doormen look you up and down. Not so at Redbury. It's just a super cool, low key (for now) place to call home when you are in LA. The food at Cleo's is awesome too. While the drinks are expensive, they are delicious. I highly recommend the Clemintina. I miss it. We also managed to get a stupendous rate, which I hope will not change much for our future travels. Are there some glitches...yes...the rooms aren't dark (as some other reviewers have mentioned) it's just that finding all the light switches is a little difficult. It took us about 5 minutes when we walked in to figure out where all the switches were and how to turn them on. And, yes, it can get a little noisy. The first night we were there the club next door was pretty loud. Luckily, the noise stopped at around midnight and our jetlag lulled us to sleep. There's no doubt in my mind (if the rates stay the same) this will be the only place I rest my weary head when I am reluctantly dragged in to the city of devils.", "Date": "January 20, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "St Louis", "Title": "\u201cFabulous service, fun rooms but dark spaces\u201d", "Author": "JillStLouis", "ReviewID": "UR88871519", "Content": "The concierge staff could not have been better.
