We arrived a bit early on check-in day- the check-in time is 3pm and they adhere to it. Although we had booked with El Tukan, they showed us a room at Moongate Hotel (a property beloning to El Tukan just across the street). We weren't happy at all with the room (very small, just one double bed, window directly to noisy 5ta Avenida, moldy smell in the bathroom) and asked for a different room. This one actually was at El Tukan, with two double beds, a balcony with view to the pool and a decent bathroom. Overall, we thoroughly enjoyed our stay at El Tukan; the breakfast buffet at El Ceiba restaurant across the road was more than adaquate, with fruits, yogurts, omelettes made to order and other breakfast items changing on a daily basis. The staff were friendly and efficient, rooms were made up everyday and towels changed. We didn't use the pool or jacuzzi, as the water there was a bit too cold for our liking. Included in the stay is access to the hotel's beach club, which is a couple of blocks away. There is a shuttle, however we enjoyed walking the short distance every day. We couldn't get any drinks from the beach club's bar, as we didn't have the all-inclusive bracelet, but the friendly waiters from neighbouring Kool Beach Club will get you anything you like. All- in-all, we can highly recommend El Tukan, however make sure you get a room in the main property, not at Moongate. We think it is good value for money and if you like to eat out at different places, the breakfast will be perfect for you.

It was the nicest of the three that had meal-plan/drink options. We originally planned for just breakfast, but we decided on the \"all inclusive\" red wristband deal, which was a bargain. $20 per person per day. Unlimited food at the three sittings, which was essentially all day. Basic drinks included (national liquor, beer & wine brands). All of this is in the restaurant across the street, which is very plain, but nice, and all of it was buffet, which ranged from very good to fair. Never went away hungry. Drinks were a bit light, but you just ask for double shots in them. Beer and wine is basic, but works. So, obviously not a high-end destination, but perfect for a scrappy no-nonsense vacation in the heart of everything. The rooms are basic in furnishings & amenities (for Mexico). The pool photo is accurate, and the center of all the rooms, representative of the feel of the place. The pool and jacuzzi are NOT heated, though! There is a restaurant and bar much nicer on the front, but there is a more expensive all-inclusive required for that, which allows you to eat/drink there and at other sister-hotels/restaurants. The beach club/bar is included in the red wristband deal, and made all the difference. It is about six blocks away, and offers nice lounge chairs, towels, and the same type drinks. There was a group of Florida girls we saw each day who easily got very drunk! (Good people-watching.) Surprisingly, there were other gay couples in the area which we did not expect. So much less an issue there - no one cares. Hell, we could've got married there if we wanted to. A couple issues that were problematic turned out to be not the hotel's fault. When a hurricane is approaching the town shuts down liquor across the board - nowhere for 18 hours! (Gasp!) I complained enough for a reduction in our plan cost and a second night eating at the nice restaurant (one is included already with the red plan.) Storm was windy, but not damaging after all. The second is the WiFi, which was maddening. Turns out we could not get a good enough signal anywhere except Starbucks, but still could not connect. This was especially odd because we had perfect WiFi service in the jungles of Costa Rica? Anyway, not really Tukan\u2019s fault. Beware roaming too. Tours are available in the lobby, and were cheaper than at the source when on the all inclusive. Almost half the price for Chichen Itza, and 2/3rds for the Coba Extreme. \u201cExtreme\u201d is medium to mild, btw. Lobby is not \u201cindoors\u201d, nor is restaurant and bar.

My friends and I were coming from different cities and wanted a cheap all inclusive in the downtown area. We narrowed our choices down to the Tukan and the Real. We decided on the Tukan based on a post from the hotel manager on trip advisor stating that guests were allowed to visit but that over night guests were required to pay 170 pesos. Our first night there a friend came to visit and was told to leave. The staff working was very rude. I explained to them what was posted on the website and that we had visited friends at that hotel before. Also one of the girls staying with us was arriving a day late due to her flight being cancelled. I asked if he could just take her all inclusive bracelet as we had paid for it and no name was assigned to it and we were told NO! In the end I paid the 170 pesos so that he could come and hang out in our room until we went out for the night. I was very angry with the attitude of the front desk staff. They were rude about the issue and dismissive. We had some other issues with staff and our room. Our room was really musty even for Playa. The room was not set up as we had expected. We asked for our room to be cleaned 3 times before someone came. We also reserved our rooms from the hotel website and then were told a different price when we arrived and the front desk said it was with tax\u2026 but we explained our final price did include tax. To be fair we were familiar with the hotel and did not expect an amazing buffet or amenities. We bought all inclusive mainly for the drinks at the beach club. The staff at the beach club were awesome! But in the end the buffet wasn\u2019t all that bad. The breakfast options were pretty good and the other meals were pretty basic. It was nice that the buffet kind of kept it more local than most all inclusives and actually had hot habanero sauce :) The hotel is in a great location and has a great beach club. We defiantly drank enough at the beach club to cover the costs of the all inclusive option but the service at the front desk will make me think twice before recommending this hotel or going back myself.", "Date": "November 2, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Curacao", "Title": "\u201cnice hotel, but if u have all inclusive for 50 us pp u get what u pay for\u201d", "Author": "Spinniecur", "ReviewID": "UR118962576", "Content": "Nice hotel, rooms are ok, service is pleasant but go only for the breakfast not for the all-inclusive.

By the way the all-inclusive deal I booked on bookit.com allowed me one dinner at a nearby restaurant, not the all-inclusive one. But I had to bargain for it because at reception they told me I could only go there if I stayed for 7 nights. I had to show the the voucher and everything to convince them otherwise. The beachclub who is part of the all-inclusive deal is not worth a visit either, there are much better beachclubs like Mamita's on calle 28 But overall don't understand me wrong, it was a great place to stay but for 50 us dollars a person the all-inclusive is not worth it.

Both times I had it booked for me by Tank-Ha, the dive shop I go with in PDC. I had read reviews of some people having problems being placed in one of their other properties (other \"boutique\" hotels in the area), or otherwise not getting what they expected, but we never had that problem at all. We were there a full two weeks this time, and also booked a room for friends for the first 5 days. We had rooms facing the pool; ours on the ground floor (easy walk out to the gardens/pool) and our friend's on the second floor. We booked the \"European Plan\", breakfast included, which we ate at their restaurant across the street. This is one of many \"budget\" hotels, but generally very clean, and certainly a convenient location. PROS: Good location, good value, clean, nice little pool area, free WiFi. CONS: Simple rooms, no ice*/fridge. The pool is small, but a nice little area. If you have a room on the ground floor facing the pool, it's literally a few steps from your garden door. 5th Ave is right outside. They are associated with a property on the beach; you can take their shuttle over there - we always walked (~.8km?). The breakfast buffet was fairly good. Not the selection you find it a large all-inclusive, but sufficient. The rooms are clean but simple (no phone, no fridge, no clock). You could get a glass or two of ice from the living bar, but if you want enough to keep drinks cold, you need to go out a few blocks on 10th Ave. to a convenience store (20 - 24 Pesos/basso). The air conditioners were effective, but since they were in-room, caused some noise, but not hard to get used to. The staff was friendly and generally helpful, as much as they could be. Example: the lounge chair on our deck broke the second day. Although we told the front desk (and I did say it wasn't urgent) it wasn't fixed when we checked out 2 weeks later. Our in-room water heater started to leak the second week. Although we were told someone would be in to change it the next day, it also wasn't changed when we checked out about 4 days later (but they changed the towels on the floor each day). On the other hand, I reported WiFi failure twice, and on both occasions, the desk made a call and a \"guy\" showed up and either rebooted the gateway and even climbed a pole to smack the antenna :) By the way, the WiFi coverage improved a to from 2010 to 2011; I had good coverage even in my room this year. I can't be too critical of their maintenance - it's Mexico (and I don't mean that negatively); if it's REALLY critical, they'll take care of it somehow; if it's not, live with it. One last comment about the garden area: 3 years ago we stayed at the Vista Caribe, 4th St., and although it was very close to the pubic beach, had a fridge, clock, phone, lots of room, we went back to the El Tukan this year mostly because my wife really enjoyed the pool/garden area, right out our back door, while I was away diving.", "Date": "September 1, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "3", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Service": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Washington DC, District of Columbia", "Title": "\u201cVery average\u201d", "Author": "ninitochka", "ReviewID": "UR116940757", "Content": "I stayed at El Tukan for 5 das in August 2011.

First off, we booked back in March and was given a description on the room that we would be getting. Which was nothing like we got. I know that things happen, but . . . . . We get there and they escort us to our room that was a block away the room was nice and modern, then they show us our first floor patio and we sere surrounded by an electric fence!!!!! Now I know Playa and this was just upsetting! We ask to have a different room that did not make us feel like we were in some kind of jail on our vacation and they said they were booked but would see what they could do. So they bring us back over the the main area of the hotel - which is the older section. They say that they have a suite available but it would cost an extra $20 a night. We agree to look at it. Walking there, it dropped to an additional $10 a night. We walk in and the room is right off the pool and no electric fence in sight, but the room is very well worn and dated and no way considered a suite. As we stand there deciding between the better of the 2 rooms, they tell us we could have if for $50 more for the week. So we take it, at least the electric fence was gone. On the positive side the room was very clean. One day they did not even bother to clean our room???? One day they only left one towel??? On our second day there, as we were getting ready for the beach, a HUGE cockroach ran across the floor and under the bed! You can call them waterbugs if that makes you feel better, but they are cockroaches. As we attempt to leave the room to notify the front desk, we open the door to be greeted by 100s of cockroaches running for their lives - large and small. The management decided to exterminate. To make things more interesting is that the iguanas were having a field day with all the roaches running around. How about a little notice. The grounds keepers thought is was funny as I ran screaming to the front desk because there were soooo many roaches running they were running across my feet!!!! One evening we went to exchange our beach towels for the next day. We had used them for 3 days and thought it would nice to have fresh ones. The man at the front desk told us to bring them by in the morning and exchange them then. So we come by the next morning and the new guy at the front desk started yelling at us and refusing to give us clean towels!!! Refusing!!! How do you refuse to give a clean towel, we were not asking for them daily. Needless to say, I stood my ground until we got clean ones. Then the food!!!! Other than the breakfast, which is hard to screw up, I would not feed their food to my dog!!!! Almost everyday, breakfast through dinner, they served hot dogs!!!! They put hot dogs in everything. I do know that this was not one of those high end all -inclusives, but give me a break. Other than breakfast, we NEVER ate there, it was terrible. One night we did get to eat with the people who spent more and that food was excellent! I just can't believe they get away with serving such a low standard of food to their other customers! The only enjoyable part of the stay was the beach club. They share space with the KOOL beach club and they have a great pool right on the beach. The beach bar that the Tukan is very small and offers only low end beer and drinks, but at least there is a place to lay at the ocean. The bar staff was always more than friendly.

So we know what we are talking about!We have done it all- 5 star hotels, 3 star hotels, all inclusives, backpacking,european plans, 4 crusies-we have tried it all! and...we loved El Tukan! 1. If you like the comfort of fancy all inclusive quiet resorts-this is NOT the place for you! this is a very cool hotel, with a lot of vegetation and with an AH-MAZING location- close to the beach, night life,restaurants and even to big supermarkets like Walmart and mega! seriously it has it all. If you like to party and have a good time and like the fact you don't need a taxi for ANYTHING, then this is the place for you. ROOMS: For a 3 star hotel this place is amazingly clean!We were seriously impressed!The rooms as well as the hotel grounds are impeccably clean!Keep up the good work!The rooms are very basic but very cute.Lots of closet space. yes, the rooms may be a bit louder (but only until midnight) if you are facing the street, but if you have a room facing the pool-no problem at all. BEDS: we had a queen size bed and it was huge, yes it was a bit hard but nothing you couldn't get used to. AIR-CONDITIONING: yes the air conditioning was a bit loud, but here is the catch!When you leave the room set the temperature to 20 degrees Celsius or so, that will cool off the room really nicely! then at night, when you are about to go to sleep, set the air conditioning to 25-26 degrees and the room will remain cool but the system would work for a minute or 2 and then go on stand by for 30 mins or so.This way you can sleep with no noise and still enjoy the freshness. During the day the noise didn't bother us at all. THE FOOD: we only had breakfast included and we must say it was pretty repetitive and not too much choice...but it was DELICIOUS!go to the omelet station and you can ask for any type of eggs or even better, ask for freshly made quesadillas with your choice of ham or chorizo, or both-amazing!some days food was better than others.they had pancakes, french toast, grilled ham and cheese sandwiches,empanadas,tacos dorados and a lot of delish fresh pastries and fruits.No cold cuts and cheeses though. for lunch and dinned there were soooo many restaurants around and really cheap too, we had no problems finding good food. THE BEACH: is breath taking. white sand and turquoise water. the beach club is great, with a huuuuge clean washroom and shower, and the best thing for us- at noon the DJ starts playing house music at the Kool beach club(which is adjacent to the el tukan beach club).the beach is a 10 minute walk from the hotel, and a very pleasant walk indeed. LOCATION: the best location ever!we never needed a taxi not even once!we walked to all the restaurants and bars , we walked to Walmart and mega, we walked to the playa del carmen port!If you want all the action close to you-this is the place! STAFF: was very friendly and nice.we had a few problems with our room keys(they got demagnetized) and our shower wasn't working one day but they fixed the problems pretty fast. NIGHT LIFE: i must say that this is a perfect hotel for party people. the hotel itself is quiet but the fun is just 2 blocks away! all the best clubs are literally 2 blocks away on 5th avenue and 12th street (the hotel is on 5ht av and 14th street). the clubs are amazing, from Mandala, to Blue Parrot to Pink Elephant and Coco Bongo. The fifth av restaurants and bars die off after midnight and then the party continues on the 12th street.

It included the use of the beach club, only 5-10 min walk away with free drinks until 5pm. The beach club had palm beach cabanas with loungers to use, and was right beside 2 volleyball nets, which we used during half of our stay. Location: excellent! Right on 5a where all the hotels, restaurants, stores are. The clubs are only 2 blocks away, so far enough to not hear them, but close enough to enjoy at your leisure. Walked about 8 blocks to catch the colletiva (crowded, local transportation, but with a/c) when wanting to explore areas outside of Playa del Carmen without having to purchase from a tour operator. Rooms: it's budget. But having said that, it's equipped with an a/c box (ie. noisy, so bring earplugs if needed), and a basic TV with cable to watch movies or sports. Yes, most are in spanish, but then you're in Mexico. And they chambermaids do a good job of cleaning it. Just be aware, some rooms can be musty smelling, so I would suggest to continually ask them for a new room, even if it's every day. Sleep quality: the beds are somewhat firm, but I like firm mattresses so it was fine for me. If you only sleep on softer mattresses, consider bringing a mattress pad; some of my friends had difficulty sleeping because of it. Again, if you need complete quiet to sleep, but need the a/c on, bring ear plugs. Buffet restaurant, La Ceiba: this was across the street and our one restaurant included in our all-inclusive package. Food was good. Nothing exceptional, but they did try to change the dinner options each day. I'd recommend checking out the grill station for the best option...especially if it's tacos or omelettes for breakfast. Chicken was always good, usually fish except when it was salted too much, but beef/ pork tended to be too chewy each time. Staff at La Ceiba were WONDERFUL!!! Young Manuel and Valentin were very helpful and friendly. Very accommodating, funny, entertaining and really enjoyed their jobs. Tips: Ask for a to-go cup if you want a coffee while you walk to the beach. Ask for a to-go container to fill up with fruit to snack on at the beach between breakfast and lunch, too. A la carte restaurant, Los Tulipanes: one night with reservations included for each week you stay. Menu options were small for all-inclusive, but food was delicious! Shrimp tacos highly recommended as a starter/ appy. Again, beef tended to be chewy (in my fajitias), so order one of the other mains, as my friends did. Server, Victor, was very helpful, and drinks from the bar were delicious (Mojitos, tequila). One thing that turned our dining experience into an unpleasant one though, was the older Manuel (manager?). There was a mix-up with the date of our reservation: we asked for Friday, but it was written down on Saturday's schedule. The manager, Manuel, decided to blame us for arriving on the wrong date. Even after the discovery was made, he decided to shove the piece of paper for Saturday into my friend's face, to show her the date, which was written in Spanish, in the corner. The restaurant wasn't full the entire evening. We told him we were sorry for the mix-up, but we did request for the Friday, and assurred him we wouldn't try to come the following evening for the reservations, and he could even scratch our name out on the list. He didn't like our answer, so made the rest of our dinner very uncomfortable and awkward by getting our bill dropped off before we even finished our drinks. On top of that, our server wasn't allowed to serve us anymore, so even asking for our dessert and waiting for 40+ min, dessert was never served. It became a terrible restaurant experience for us, which was unfortunate, as we were planning on coming back another night to order from the regular full menu (like lobster), since the food and service, up to then, was so good. Let's just say we never returned for any meals there, and even paid to eat at another restaurant to boycott it. Service: it could be better at this hotel. When checking in, they didn't tell us of what was included in our all-inclusive package, or where to go to get certain things. For example, we read our notes, so knew about the beach club, but had to ask around for directions to it, and also discovered after arriving there, we had to pick up our beach towels at the front desk. I would suggest they have a little check-list of what is included in your all-inclusive package, with a little map of the different areas, instead of the generic Playa del Carmen map. Also, they never gave us a beach towel card, even after we asked if we needed one (not a problem), but one morning when we went to the front desk to ask for towels, the guy asked for our towel cards and wouldn't give us towels, until we exhaustively explained to him no cards were ever given to us. Pool: it's small. If you have kids and don't want to go to the ocean because of the salt water or waves, then it's nice to take a refreshing dip in. There's free Wi-Fi, but reception in some rooms can be sparse. And you need to bring your own laptop or smart phone.

The service was good too. I was somewhat dissappointed with the room when we first arrived. Kind of plain, boring and a bit dated. However, we didn't travel to Mexico to just stay in the hotel so it wasn't a big deal. It was a standard room with a king size bed. The bed was very hard. Some people may like this but i like plush beds so I found it hard to sleep and was stiff in the morning for the first few days there until I got used to it. There was hot water usually for about 10 minutes. The a/c and t.v. worked fine. We rented the safety deposit box for $1 a day which I would recommend. My spouse's prescription shampoo disappeared from the shower area which was kind of wierd, but otherwise nothing else ever went missing. We didn't spend much time at the pool and never went in, but laying around the pool was very relaxing with all the vegetation around. If you want to tan though the sun usually limited with all the trees...and people quickly grab up the areas with sun. The beach area was often busy...found it hard to find a chair and usually had to lay on the beach for awhile until two came available. They also have wireless if you have your laptop with you.

After reading these reviews we had requested a quiet room and a queen sized bed. We were told 'no problem' come to the front desk in the morning to get a different room. Went to the front desk in the morning and they said 'there are no more rooms, come back tomorrow and see if there is a better room\"..Needless to say, this went on until Tuesday morning..each time the same answer..there are no rooms (even after we saw many many people check out). Service is absolutley lousy here. They will of course, upgrade to a 'premium room' if you pay $56 per night more - they suggested this each time..but would not accommodate moving us to a different 'standard' room. We eventually gave up asking and just had to live with sleeping in different beds (no snugs for us) We covered our heads with pillows each night as the band below our room was super loud and the walls super thin. It literally sounded like they were playing in our room! The standard 'all inclusive' only includes the buffet restaurant and none of the a la carte restaurants which was disappointing. The meals were repetitive and mundane..reminded me of a cuban all inclusive I went to last year at Lil Tuxpan. There was always something to fill you up, but nothing special ever. They never served tacos which is what I was looking forward to. We went out to eat about half the time. (you definitely NEED to check out Los Amigos at the corner of 30th ave and 26th street - it's SOOOOO cheap and tastey with a great little local atmosphere - 10 tacos, 2 pops and starter chips and dips for 74 pesos!) The rooms in this hotel were clean and bigger than I expected.....the beds were hard but sleepable. We always had hot water and satellite tv. We rented the security box in our room for $1 a day or so which was recommended. On the bus back to the airport we ran into people who 'used to' stay at this hotel but said it has gone down hill since the managment changed. They now stay at a sister hotel 2 blocks away called Playa Riel and said it's the same price but the food is much better and they have outstanding service. That's where I will stay next time too. The location is great - I would recommend staying in downtown playa del carmen rather than in the resort zone if you like to snoop around the area and people watch. As soon as you leave the hotel you are in the middle of fun shopping and lots of great little restaurants. We rented bikes and toured all over the city (rented bikes for $13 day at Carmen Sol on 30th avenue). It was a 10 minute walk to the beach but with the awesome weather..we didn't mind this jaunt at all. There were never enough lounge chairs on the beach and we often had to lie on the sand, but this didn't bother us too much. The pool and jacuzzi tub were very cold and completely uninviting..we rarely saw anyone there..don't go there for the pool! We had a great vacation in spite of some disappointments with this hotel.

First and foremost - if you think you're booking a room at the Tukan, beware that you may not end up actually getting a room there. We were placed in the Moongate, across the street - a FAR inferior hotel. There was no glass on the window, only wooden slats that could be opened and closed. There was a window directly behind our (very, very hard) bed, that opened onto the (busy and loud) 5th Avenue. We did not get any sleep our first night because of this, and when we requested a room in the actual Tukan the next morning, we were told it would cost an extra $120 to upgrade to a suite. We did upgrade, and this made a huge difference. Our new room was on the 3rd floor, with a balcony that faced the pool. All of the furniture was in good repair, the bed was slightly softer, the windows had glass, and the room was always very clean. One ceiling fan didn't work, and the remote for the TV didn't work, either - but the AC was wonderful. The housekeeping staff were excellent - we did not use the safe and didn't lose anything. Each day, the staff arranged towel art for us. However, there was very little hot water (not enough for a full shower, ever). It was also difficult to get a straight answer from the front. For instance, we attempted to arrange a late check out, and were given conflicting information, despite the fact our room was not needed during the time we were requesting. After fighting for the late check out, we won - but had to pay 100 pesos an hour for it (nearly $10/US an hour). Other than the front desk personnel, I enjoyed all of the Tukan staff. The restaurant servers could be hit and miss (but if you leave a small tip, your experience will be hugely improved - we did so regularly, and had servers coming to our table to take drink orders, etc.). I also noticed servers repeatedly carrying plates to tables for the elderly, which was nice to see. The bell boys are friendly, and seem to know more about the area (and speak better English) than the front desk staff as well. And I can't say enough great things about Marco, who arranges tours for you (he has a desk by reception). He is friendly, knowledgeable, speaks several languages, and is full of energy. He never expects or asks for a tip (though we gave him one on the last day, and he was extremely gracious). The location of the actual Tukan was great - set back from 5th, through a beautiful garden, that muffled the noise but kept the action close. The beach club was very crowded, and it is difficult to get a seat not in the shade. There were definitely not enough chairs - they were full before 11 am - and the beach club bar/servers were miserable. The beach itself is beautiful, but the sand is becoming rather dirty (cigarette butts, other garbage, etc.). The buffet included with the AI plan is monotonous. Breakfast NEVER changes, and the coffee is atrocious (the first morning, we actually had to spoon coffee grounds out of the cup). The fresh fruit is wonderful, however. Lunch is okay, dinner usually follows a theme. Nothing terribly exciting, and we ate out despite the AI plan rather frequently. And as another reviewer mentioned - the hot tub is cold. At least as cold as the pool. I went swimming in an underground cenote that was warmer than the \"hot tub\". All in all, it is doubtful I would recommend the Tukan to aynone, or return myself, thanks to the problems had with the front - which is disappointing.", "Date": "February 19, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Sleep Quality": "1", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "ottawa", "Title": "\u201c4th time at the El Tukan....definitely the last\u201d", "Author": "mrsbeasely", "ReviewID": "UR56512962", "Content": "I am writing this from the hotel today.

The hot water, ceiling fan and air conditioning worked very well and the room cooled quickly. There was a good sized television with cable. My room had wireless internet access but not all rooms do. They also have wireless internet access in the lobby. A good quality safe deposit box is available for $1 per night (you get the key and lock mechanism to insert). The room was kept clean and fun towel art was provided daily. The cleaning staff were helpful and responsive. The hotel grounds were lush, the location of the hotel perfect for exploring Playa, and it was ideal for me taking a Spanish course at the IH Riviera Maya school which was one minute away by foot. There is an inexpensive laundry next door (Lava Facil) if you need one and choose not to use the hotel's service. There is also a convenience store at the corner with sodas, water, beer, snacks, etc. I didn't do the all-inclusive but I ate at the El Tukan restaurant, which sits along 5th Avenue, and the food was reasonably priced and pretty good. I had the breakfast buffet there and the hotel/restaurant staff brought juice and took my order for omelettes (included in buffet price) cooked to order. The buffet wasn't massive but it had everything I wanted for less than 10 dollars. Prices for breakfast buffets were about the same everywhere. The location of the hotel in the center of the action allows you to eat at a different place for every meal if you wish. The hotel does not offer a refrigerator in the room unless you require it for insulin, etc. Though adjacent to 5th avenue, my hotel room was very quiet. There are no clocks or phones in the rooms so bring an alarm clock if you need to be up at a particular time. There were no bad odors in, or around, my room. There is adequate space for clothing in the armoire and drawers in the desk, also. There were only three hangers, so you may need those, also. The prices were better if booking through their web site, tukanhotels.com, than from other sites I looked at and much cheaper than booking at their front desk. Though within walking distance, a free shuttle runs from the hotel to the beach club regularly through the day, and returns every two hours. Their beach club is very nice with plenty of chairs and palapas and use of a pool there. I went to the beach at prime times and never had problems finding a chair or palapa but I didn't travel during the prime season. The pool at the beach looked nice but is not a pool for small children. Service was good at the beach club for drinks. Bring a bag to take to the beach and maybe take your lunch and/or drinks with you. The pool at the hotel was very nice with plenty of lounge chairs and a hot tub adjacent. I didn't try the hot tub but kids were having plenty of fun in the pool. The hotel gives you one beach towel and you can exchange it is many times as you like. I did check out Nina, their less expensive (if you can call 59/night expensive) facility on Calle 6. Their rate, including tax, was 35 usd per night. They were 8 blocks from the main hotel and pool and the rooms were a little smaller, tv's a little smaller, and the two rooms I checked out smelled a little of mildew to me. That smell may go away with the air conditioners on but I can't say for sure. The Nina had lounge chairs in a grassy garden area but you would have access to the El Tukan pool and beach club. If you were looking at a cheap place, it would beat the youth hostel which I didn't hear much positive about. It was a very international and pleasant group of guests in residence. Taxis are cheap within this zone of Playa so you could easily walk to Wal-Mart and catch a cab back to the hotel with an inexpensive Styrofoam cooler and some supplies/drinks. Whenever I went to the front desk there was always someone who spoke fluent English and French. To get there from the airport, if traveling alone without more than a rolling suitcase and a backpack, just take the ADO bus. It leaves from the airport regularly, is very comfortable, air conditioned, usually has US movies on the television, goes non-stop directly to the Juarez/5th Avenue bus station in Playa for about 100 pesos (about 8 usd) per person. Just convert 10 dollars to pesos in the airport. Convert any more money at better rates in Playa. It's a short walk to the hotel from the bus station, or you can catch a cab for very little money from the bus station. My only complaints were the usual Riviera Maya hard mattress, and the tile floor in the room could use a good scrubbing. The tile was mopped daily (I saw them doing it) and looked very clean but after walking on it barefoot for a short time, my feet were black. I kept my sandals beside the bed and outside the shower to keep on at all times. Overall, a great value and if I return to Playa, I'll definitely go to El Tukan.", "Date": "December 13, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "5.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Zimmerman, Minnesota", "Title": "\u201cAlready have a trip back planned\u201d", "Author": "Sandraminnesota", "ReviewID": "UR45464271", "Content": "Fabulous bargain, tropical setting.

The Moongate was closed and they put us up across the street at the Hotel Tukan, which is a nice looking hotel built around a lush tropical garden. The rate included a substantial breakfast buffet, and the Tukan Beach Club. The Beach Club was about 8-10 blocks away (they have a shuttle to the beach), a beautiful beach, and it saved us from paying $8/day for 2 chairs and a palapa. We could also buy drinks and lunch there, and did. The hotel is right on 5th Avenue (Quinta Avenida), which is pedestrian only and lined with shops and restaurants, etc. The room was OK, but very dim. When we turned on the one ceiling light we could barely tell it was on. You definitely couldn't read by it. We asked for a lamp and they gave it to us, and that helped. Also, there was no chair, but we brought in one from our patio, so that worked. And the bed was hard, but surprisingly not uncomfortable. The bathroom was fine, plenty of hot water, new fixtures, 2 lights in the bathroom vs. only 1 in the room, nicely decorated. So I got the impression that other rooms were much nicer than ours, and also more expensive. I can see in the hotel photos that they have more lights and look really nice. But since I don't know what the other rooms are like and how much they go for, I can't say if it is such a good value for everyone.

I had planned on going Apr.17-27 with a buddy and we booked the Moongate Hotel (a sister hotel to the El Tukan) across the street. We booked with Expedia and booked 2 double beds. On arrival, we were told we had a king at the Moongate which was totally unacceptable. They said no problem, we will put you in El Tukan the first night and in the AM you can discuss this with the manager. We went to the room (406) and found it was poolside with a nice deck surrounded by palms. This room was perfect! Upon entering the room, the entrance is separate from the sleeping area with counter space, cupboards, and a sofa. This was perfect as the first day we went to Walmart for a few supplies. Picked up a styrofoam cooler ($4), 1 cup coffee maker ($9), beer, Don Julio tequlia, Controy and margarita mix. Also some plastic spoons and large plastic cups for making margaritas. Who needs AI! I'd do about a 30 block hike each morning taking photos and return to enjoy the PM with a margarita on the deck by the pool. The pool was never crowded and there were always chairs available. I think most people went to the beach. Management allowed us to stay in this room the entire 10 days. I think the hotel uses the Moongate across the street as an overflow. The whole time I was there I never saw any guests entering or leaving the Moongate. The room was always clean with towel art every day but I made sure to leave 50 pesos on the pillow each morning for the maid. The room was always cleaned by 11 AM when I returned from my hike. All the staff I met were friendly and with a quick Hola whenever you saw them. Maitenance, security, front desk, housekeeping, it didn't matter, they all had a greeting and a smile for you. The hotel itself is in a prime location. Right on 5th Ave. but far enough north so you are away from most of the pushy vendors. From Calle 14 south to the pier you seem to run the gauntlet of vendors but this hotel is a couple blocks north of that and the vendors don't seem so pushy. You are surrounded by great restaurants, bars, and small hotels in this neighborhood. Dubai, Coco Bongo, End Zone, Tequila Barrel are all within a block or 2 and there is a great pizza stand across the street for late night snacks. This was my 4th trip to the Riviera Maya but my 1st time staying in Playa and not at an AI. After this trip, I will never stay at an AI again. My last 3 trips were at a 5 star resort, and if you're willing to give up a little pampering and amenities, this 3 star hotel has everything you need in a perfect location! I am already planning a 3 week trip for July and will definitely try to book El Tukan again. By the way, when we subtracted our airfare from the total cost, our stay cost $52CDN/night split 2 ways without the AI option.

Rooms: old, in dire need of maintenance and updating although the beds were comfortable. Nice to have hammocks on the balcony. We stayed at poolside which to me was the absolute best spot - room 401. No hair dryers, no coffee makers, no coffee to be had anywhere at hotel before 7:00 am (if you are an early riser). Cleanliness: Room cleaning hit and miss. Some days lovely towel art and sparkling floors. Other days a bit to be desired. Balcony area never once swept or cleaned so I eventually found a broom and did myself. Staff: Overall pretty friendly maintenance and cleaning staff. Excellent, friendly and diligent security staff...really felt safe. However front desk staff not so accommodating (except wonderful man who checked us in...didn't catch his name...only friendly one) they seem annoyed when you ask for anything...ie: I desperately needed an extra garbage bag to tidy up our room and I was told to go ask housekeeping...housekeeping didn't have any!! Never got a bag and gave up. One example of many. Grounds: Excellent very clean pool, well maintained. No pool bar or service. Food: Good breakfast. Lunch and Supper with plenty of mystery meat and potatoes. Rarely salads or any variation on fruit offerings: papaya and melon. Many people seemed to enjoy the food. I had a hard time. A vegetarian wouldn't make it at all. Mostly meat/potatoes/breads. I have never eaten so many buns/butter. Why no Mexican food!!!??? Also on the restaurant: they are militant about carrying a coffee or beer to your room-want you to use Styrofoam yet never have any available. A bit of a hassle with having to cross the street and the environment of the eating hall is a bit like a hospital cafeteria....no ambiance what-so-ever. I worked it out that the food budget we would have had without the 'all inclusive' would have been about $200 per day for our family of three and we could have had some pretty good food for that - not the same crud day in and day out. Location: Many people comment the 5th ave location is great, however I found it noisy. I will not choose to stay off of the beach again. It was a pain to get to the beach and then there were not enough chairs and as several people have mentioned-no food-not even nachos served at beach club. The \"all inclusive\" does not include water sports equipment, etc that is usually part of an all inclusive. General: Most guests are European it seems. Most guests very nice, quiet and reserved-in general a quite resort..no partiers in sight.", "Date": "March 30, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Calgary", "Title": "\u201cGreat Stay at El Tukan!\u201d", "Author": "FirsttimersCalgary", "ReviewID": "UR26683686", "Content": "My husband and I just returned from our first trip to Playa Del Carmen. We had a fantastic stay at El Tukan, and would highly recommend it! A few things to keep in mind: this is not a five star resort, so the food is okay, and the rooms are older. But if your looking to save a buck at a clean hotel, and still be in the centre of town, then its definitely worth looking into. If possible, try to book a 1bdrm premium all inclusive package. For the extra cost (approx. $200), it is well worth every penny. Here is what we thought: What we liked: - The room we were in (401) is clean... no bugs, mold etc... - The service is by far five star quality - talk to Marco when booking tours. He will find the best deals. - The location is right in the centre of all the action on 5th ave. Yet tucked away enough that the nights were still quiet and romantic. - The grounds are beautiful with lush tropical plants, and large palm trees. - With the premium package we had a choice between the buffet meals or a sit down meal at the little restaurant next to the hotel. And we could have free drinks at the bar on the hotel grounds. Well worth the extra cost! - We took our three year old daughter with us, who has food allergies. Marco arranged for us to meet with the manager at the buffet restaurant who put together a special menu just for her. I cannot express how much we appreciated that - esp. given that this is not a 5 star hotel! - Beach club is beautiful, with no rocks and lots of white sand. We had many people tell us that we had the nicest area of beach on the entire strip...and we believe it! - No line ups...ever! With only 133 rooms, you never have to line up for reservations or fight for pool side chairs. The beachclub is another matter..... Dislikes: - If you go with the standard package, you are limited to free food and drinks at the buffet only. There isn't really much of a bar, and the buffet food is a bit repetitive. But still very tasty, with a good variety. Again....go premium. - The pool is only 3-4 ft deep, and is rather small. Not good for those that enjoy doing laps. - Very little to do for kids. We didn't mind as our daughter is young enough to entertain herself with a bucket of sand. But I wouldn't recommend this hotel for anyone with older children that want to play at the pool, or at a kids club. - space at the beach is limited, so if you want a chair in the shade - go early! We always arrived between 10am -1pm and were able to find space...but it wasn't always easy. -the beds are hard hard hard....but apparently that is quite normal for Mexico. I would much rather a hard bed at a 3 star vs. cockroaches at a 5 star!! TIPS: - Go Premium!!! I really cannot stress that enough!! - Apparently this is very rare, but we saw a scorpian in the garden on our second night and nearly stepped on it. I would recommend keeping balcony doors closed...just in case of little visitors. When we told the hotel staff...the were all shocked as none of them have ever witnessed scorpians at the hotel. - The beach club is a bit of a walk away. But you can walk right along 5th ave. where there is tons to see on the way. If walking is not for you, there is a shuttle that runs regularily. Overall - this is an awesome place to stay, and we will definitely be back....but maybe without the little one next time.

We travelled with Signature Vacations on a last minute deal. There were aspects I loved about the trip and aspects I did not love...I hope this helps you make your decision. Loved: -King sized bed in a large, corner room on the fourth floor (I emailed the hotel directly to ask for a room on the quiet side, away from those travelling with children.) I was pleased with this room. -Hotel staff really try to make you as comfortable as possible. I was happy that most spoke english and that they said hi whenever they saw me and my partner. Marco, the concierge, was the most helpful and suggested tours and touristy things to do. I was surprised to hear him speaking fluent french to other guests-very impressive!! Eugento at the beach club is friendly as well as the other man who worked with him-I didn't catch his name though. They'll make you any sweet girly drink you can name. -La Cieba buffet restaurant staff try really hard to keep your drink filled and your empty plates cleared. Breakfast was my favorite meal there, while my partner loved the lunches. Ok selection-something for everyone but its an average buffet - good enough for all-inclusive. -The hotel gardens are beautiful and help keep the street noise to a minimum. Large palm trees and well tended gardens were beautiful, home to plenty of little lizards that may join you on the pool deck for some sunning. The pool is refreshingly cool to the hot sun. Didn't love: -We had a late flight and arrived at the hotel around 1:30am since Playa is aprox. 45minutes away. As a courtesy it would have been nice of the hotel to have something for us to eat/drink when we arrived. I know this isn't the hotels fault-for when the flights happen-but maybe if they prepared for late check ins the guests would feel a little better taken care of. -The beach club is easily 10-15 minutes away, and you have to basically leave right after breakfast to get a lounge chair/umbrella for the day. Like another reviewer mentioned, they only serve drinks. The food at the Kool beach club right next door is pricey. This is definitely something they should reconsider-even if it's serving fruit or buns, even peanuts. I liked the exercise, but some people will not like that the beach club is far from the hotel. -I am a messy person, and I find it embarrassing for someone I don't know to see my dirty underwear or my unmade bed. I don't need housekeeping every day, so I kept the do not disturb sign on the door. The day before departure the sign was up when we left and when we returned our room had been serviced. I found this very intrusive and annoying. -Our departure flight was at 10:45am and our transfer van arrived and wanted to leave at 7:00am. The signature rep said that departure would be around 7:15am so I was disappointed that we had to leave without eating breakfast. The front desk agent, at the time, seemed eager to have us check out and cut our all-inclusive bracelets off. I found this very sneaky-and chintzy. We ended up eating at the airport.

It wasn't our choice, we had prepaid a room at the Illusion Hotel, who overbooked and handed us over to El Tukan. Location: El Tukan is one of the larger Playa hotels, situated on 5th Ave, and taking up almost a whole square block. It is wonderfully quiet, though conveniently close to restaurants and bars. The beach: The sea is 2 blocks away; although that part of the shore is taken up by the marina. The actual beach is a 10-25 minute walk away, depending on how far you're willing to walk to avoid the crowds. The hotel reportedly provides a shuttle service to their beach club several times a day. The room: Basic, clean accommodation with tile floors (nice on account of the sand), shower, free beach towels, locked safe available for 1USD/day extra charge, and a nice porch with a couple of chairs. Get some mosquito repellent! No room phone. Most items are well worn, but the service staff is fast and courteous. To give you an idea, some towels are frayed, but the maids are ga-ga creative with the towel displays (swan, kissing swans, hearts, water-lily and even a baby shape on New Year's Eve). The food: We like to sample diverse, local food, and we'd rather pay more and eat out, than try an all-inclusive program. Nevertheless, the \"reservation hand-over\" from Illusion threw in free breakfast buffets which were OK (scrambled eggs, omelettes to order, fried plantaines, fresh fruit, waffles etc), though repetitious to tears after a few days, as expected. The crowd: El Tukan seems to be popular with several European travel agencies, hence an international, reasonably well-behaved, beach-bound crowd.
