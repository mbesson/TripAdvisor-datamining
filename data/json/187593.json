No doubt that it offered a great hotel experience for the English upper class at one time. Not any more. Whoever owns this hotel needs to make a lot of renovations if the extremely expensive rates are to be justified. (I may not have gotten the best rate, but at $700 a night, the apartment was vastly overpriced). The problem is that the hotel seems very old and only partially renovated. The furniture seems more yard sale than antique. Every time you open a drawer you wonder if it will close again, whether the knob will come off, whether it will just collapse. Contrary to some other reviewers I think the place was clean, but due to its age, it just looks dirty. They cleaned the carpets when my family was there, but they had the same dusty look after after procedure. The hotel keeps its AAA stars because of the services it offers, such as 24 hour room service, but frankly I think the owner would do better getting rid of the perks and just be a 3 start hotel at a more reasonable price. If Durley House wants to survive as expensive boutique class lodging, the owners really need to replace all the carpets and furniture. The portable air conditioners with hoses out the window need to be replaced by central A/C, or by something built in -- although if you look at the wiring closely, this might not be feasible (check behind the fridge!) . To add insult to injury they added a bag of pistachios to our charges after we departed (which we never consumed) but gracefully promised to remove the charge when I e-mailed to complain. But, of course, they actually never bothered to remove it. Not real classy. Square footage in this neighborhood is undoubtedly expensive, and they give you a lot of it, but in the end it is like staying in Grandma's house -- it is just feels run down feeling -- even the couches sag. Judging by the positive reviews, some people are very happy with the homey feel of Grandma's aging apartment that Durley House provides -- but if that is not your taste, you can do much better in London at a cheaper price.", "Date": "February 8, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Sollentuna, Stockholms Lan, Sweden", "Title": "\u201cWonderful stay\u201d", "Author": "584Thomas_H", "ReviewID": "UR119383701", "Content": "Durley House is the perfect apartment hotel in a very nice part of London.

We are quite well traveled and opt for first class air travel, 5 star hotels and do enjoy luxury thus we can be quite fastidious with accommodation and are fairly picky. We decided that the city of London demanded a boutique hotel and found Durley House situated in the middle of London on Sloane Street which is in the most wonderful central and not to mention completely chic location. We arrived late but were offered a complimentary beverage and shown to our suites without delay. This is an all suite boutique hotel and my Mother and Nephew were given a 2 bedroom suite which was rather huge by London standards and fully equipped with floor to ceiling windows from the elegant drawing room looking over the park. With a full kitchen, bathroom and two bedroom they were quite impressed. Whilst my partner and I had a one bedroom luxury suite which was most spacious again with kitchen and drawing room that again enjoyed views of the park opposite. This hotel is defenitely not modern day hi tech or minimalist and is more old world glamor at it's very best abound in history and delight. The bathrooms are well equipped with over sized towels and zen bathroom products whilst some may say they are dated I disagree and imagine that these are just how the bathrooms would be at Buckingham Palace, classically styled and fully functional with strong powerful showers which are great after a busy day in London. The Drawing room in our suite was ideal and the 4 of us had breakfast on our first morning delivered by the staff via a dumb waiter elevator in our suite, served on crisp white linen and consisting of pastries, toasts, selections of cheeses and meats, cappuccinos, orange juice, eggs Benedict and the most delicious pancakes! The internet worked well and was very fast as well as a selection of papers were provided each morning along with a full supply of current fashion, home and business magazines for you to read in the suite. The hotel foyer is small as one would expect but also has a very grand and comfortable reading library located to the right. Whilst Durley House may not be suited to everyone who may want modern technology and minimalist style this all suite hotel supplied us with the perfect home away from home whilst in London. We were most comfortable with more space than we required and completely central surrounded by style, shopping and sight seeing. The Hotel concierge even managed to book us a table for dinner at The Ivy with very short notice.

Garrett spent more then 20 minutes on our arrival making sure that we had all the right restaurant choices and that we were as comfortable as possible. He was spot on all 6 times!! The whole place is amazing and is by far my best Hotel stay in all of my 40 years of Travel.
