The hotel is 2 blocks or so from the beach, so you save $$ by not being right on the beach. This hotel has a nice swimming pool and beautiful gardens and has a pretty good restaurant for a great breakfast before hitting the beach. We found that you have to rent beach chairs for the beach, so we just parked ourselves at one of the beach side restaurants and ordered food and drinks once in awhile and had a great time. We took the ferry over to Cozumel and spent the day snorkeling. Rented a jeep and toured the island and then headed back to Playa del Carmen and found a beach restaurant to have a great dinner. Took the bus to Cancan and spent a few days before heading to the airport and home. The hotel was the Aquamarine and was very nice for the money. But if you don't purchase an all inclusive plan then you can not eat at the hotel. So we took the bus, which you catch right down the street and went into town.

The room was clean and could sleep 4, although that might be a bit cozy. The water pressure in the shower was not always strong but that may have been that way since we were on the 3rd floor. It didn't bother us much. If you happened to take a shower in the middle of the day, they might not have had a chance to wash your towells that had been removed when they cleaned the room. Luckily we had brought our own for when we went diving. I thought that the price was good for the spacious room that we got although I felt the room was a bit on the dark side. I was disappointed that this room did not have an outdoor seating area as most rooms seems to have. There was a place to hang a hammock inside which my husband actually used. If I were going with a group again, I would try to get rooms #9 and #10(1 double + 1 single). Room #10 has a real nice seating area, picture included. A few nights we heard noise from a bar down the street that woke us up, not good if you are a light sleeper. The bar scene seems to run from 12-6. My sister and her husband stayed in room #5. She thought the room was a bit on the small side and a little dark. The bathroom in this room was smelly. There must have been a problem with the the toilet seal. I wish that she would have said something because I think that she could have switched rooms (I didn't find out until the her last day there). Otherwise, I liked her room. She had a nice seating area (picture included) that had a table and hammock outside her door where we would all gather. Her kids stayed in room #1 across the mini-courtyard from 5. This was a spaceous room with a frig that did not work. Again, they should have told the management about this problem. This room had 2 double beds and a table inside. No real sitting area outside. Hammock rings inside. Management was very nice. The hotel is only 2.5 blocks from the beach. There is plenty of nightlife and lots of restaurants to choose from although La Quinta has alot of expensive places. Walmart is about an 8 block walk away for stocking up on water and snacks. I'm not one to hang out at the pool but it looked like a pleasant enough area. We enjoyed our stay and would recommend this as a good priced budget hotel. Parking: we paid $5 per day to park across the street behind a gate. That was very convenient as you might have to park a few blocks away otherwise, the area is pretty busy at night.

Gary had a vision and an energy about him that added to the experience. Sadly Gary sold it and the new owner is rather different. But the Casa Tucan still has something to offer the budget traveller. Stay in one of the more expensive rooms, as the cheaper ones without air-con tend to be very hot. It is worth spending a little more to be able to sleep properly! I didn't experience any of the bed-bug problems that earlier reviewers have mentioned, and very little cockroach problems, which can be a problem in any hot country. If you spray your room before going out of an evening you can probably alleviate the age old mosquito problem that plagues the tropics. When you return home late evening close the door quickly behind you, minimising the chances of mossies getting in! The restaurant was great and the portions are generous. I recommend the excellent nachos, and definitely have your breakfasts here as they are good! It is very good value and way cheaper than the 5th Avenida places. Anja's lovely smile stays in my memory.

Overall a good spot and pretty good value for the money.", "Date": "December 5, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "1", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "1", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "PERTH", "Title": "\u201cDon't stay here!!!!\u201d", "Author": "AUSSIETRAVELMAN", "ReviewID": "UR20009332", "Content": "We arrived from Perth, Western Australia, after a long tiring flight and wanted to shower and take things easy. The bathroom smelt like a gents toilet, which didn't please us, with a skid mark in the toilet bowl. The shower was so feeble it was laughable. It was almost impossible to shower with the weak spray. I tried to plug my iPod speakers into the wall socket but it didn't work. I tried the other socket and the sound kept crackling as the current or something is not working properly. The beds are old and lumpy , and we kept itching during the night. Mosquitoes were present in the room but my mains run mosquitoe repellent didn't work properly because of the electric problem with the sockets. The next day we ate in the restaurant at the front of the complex. When I was waiting to pay I saw cockroaches running around the bar area and behind the counter. The Mexican chef was visibly perspiring into the food as he made it. We didn't eat there again. The website mentions a pool bar but it was not working. You could tell by the place that it hadn't been working for a long time. The pool is not clean, and the sunbeds are mostly damaged and dirty. We moved room after 3 nights but found the same electric problems, and the bathroom only smelt slightly better. Even the bedroom had the same stale smell that we kept masking with deodorant and perfume. I wanted to speak to the owner about the room but he was never around. The Mexican man in reception said he is always out drinking and spends little time working there.

We were so disappointed. The place is not looked after very well and our room was shoddy. The sheets are very cheap and the shower was weak. The attached scuba school would start up around 7.45 every morning and wake us, thanks to the noise they make. But worse was to come. The bed bugs were very bad indeed, causing both of us discomfort. We got our rooms changed but the same thing happened again. Mosquitoes also like the rooms, maybe because of the neglected garden area. It was like a wild garden. There was also noise from construction. The pool seemed dirty so we didnt use it. The grime around the p\u00f3ol was quite bad, and you didin{t want to sit around the area for long. Cockroaches kept showing up in our bathroom and we kept showering them down the plug hole. It was an ongojing problem. Even the safe deposit room stunk of a stale odour and the nearby toilet for people using the small restaurant stank of urine. Every night a group of drunk old Germans who live there would turn up and sit near the entrance area, loud and obnoxious. They got on peoples nerves. The restaurant is nothing sp\u00e9cial with a limited menu. The two Europeans running it seemed fed up, adding to the lousy atmosphere. The small internet cafe is the worst laid out, claustrophobic one I have ever encountered. For tiny people only! It is like an oven. And it isnt cheap. We left after 4 nights and stayed at the superb Hotel Fusion, on the beach at Calle 6. It was more expensive but well worth the money with a great bar and restaurant.

I had previously stayed there in 2007 and thought it was pretty good value. But as soon as we arrived I knew things had changed for the worse. The first thing I noticed was how dirty and overgrown the garden and pool area had become. You have to bend down to avoid the branches and leaves, and the paths seriously need a proper scrub and the litter cleared. When we got to our room we immediately found 2 dead cockroaches and later 2 live ones which we managed to get out. Given the filth in the complex this is hardly surprising. The sheets had stains of the worst kind and the room smelled very stale and needed attention in a number of areas. It all pointed to neglect. However, there was tremendous noise from drilling and hammering that began every morning as the owner is spending money on new rooms being constructed which ruins the already crowded complex. He should be addressing the decline of the old rooms instead of building new ones. The man reeks of stale alcohol and makes little sense when you speak to him. He seems more interested in doing repetitive arm exercizes in the filthy pool than helping run the hotel, which got on our nerves very quickly. The pool is now absolutely filthy, full of insects, dirt and leaves brought in by the adjacent scuba school which uses the pool for teaching. Nobody bothers to scoop it all out. Cigarette butts and a variety of insects and old leaves await the brave swimmer. I noticed only the owner used it!!! Even the sunbeds are damaged and dirty. Everything needs replacing or urgent attention. The once pleasant adjacent restaurant run by a young German couple is not what it was. The old menus are grubby and the service is surly. I speak fluent German having lived there for 9 months and would sit and listen to the 2 owners bad mouthing their clients and making spiteful remarks behind their backs. They seem to hate every nationality. The food there is very mediocre nowadays. We checked out after 2 nights and spent the next 12 nights in La Rana Cansada on Calle 10 which was excellent. It also has the super Bar Ranita attached, which is friendly and great fun, run by Mexican girls.

Rooms are simple and clean, with a working fan and fridge. The service was ok, when our fan stopped working they came to take a look at it the same day.
