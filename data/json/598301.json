There are other hotels on this beach of far greater quality AND at a greater price! i am not going to trash this hotel as it met our needs. Just be advised that this isn't the Hilton. Now for this Hotel. My family and I found it adequate for our needs. Pluses: Cheap price, um... free wi-fi, it's on the beach, and did I mention it was cheap. The AC worked well too. Negatives: The hotel elevators sounded bad and riding them was an adventure. AND like everything else in Florida, you had to wait for one. The bathrooms were small and not well ventilated. At the pool, they frequently ran out of towels, and took forever to restock. And forget any towels poolside after 6pm. Cheap prices equal large groups as we had a youth group staying throughout the hotel and did THEY have fun! The beds could use an upgrade just like everything else here. I couldn't really tell you about the bar or buffet, but both looked good to go. The bar stayed open until 10 every night. The parking lot was covered so your car didn't roast while parked ($5 per night though). The rate I paid was dirt cheap. for the three nights we stayed, the cost was equal to one night according to the going rate so all in all, it was what I expected. Had I paid full price I would be a little upset. As I said, there are better hotels than this, how much to do you want to pay though? I am sure the place rocked back during the 70's and 80's.

Hotwire recently downgraded this hotel to 2 1/2 stars which I think is pretty much on par for the accomodations. I must add they gave me $125 in Hotdollars for keeping the reservation. I still had major worries about this hotel before today. I am typing this right from my hotel room. The bad: The hotel is a bit rough around the edges. Things are not perfect and are a bit outdated. The lobby could use some renovations to keep it up to day. Some new windows, new carpets, etc in the rooms would be a good idea to charge top rates. There is a beachside musty smell in the hotel but it isn't offensive and is extremely typical for beachside hotels. The pool is fine. There is no hottub only a kiddie pool . The good: Even though the hotel is rough the rooms are clean. Our carpets were clean but a bit worn near the bathroom. Everything works in the room. There is a microwave, mini fridge and coffee maker. The air/heater unit works great. The beds are comfortable and lean to the soft side IMHO. The musty smell in the hotel disappeared in the room. The hotel is directly on the beach as advertised. The location is excellent. So what should you expect to pay for a room? Well I am here in the offseason and paid $46 a night on Hotwire. Completely reasonable and I am happy to pay that rate. What is it worth? I would say at least $70/night in the offseason. We also were able to upgrade to a beachfront room after the first day for $10/night. The room quality was the same but the view was worth it. The beds were firmer in the beachfront rooms. Bottom line is the hotel really is not bad. It is safe, pretty clean and has a great location. Don't panic if you booked this place through Hotwire or Priceline.. Your vacation will be just fine. Just don't expect the Hilton. Expect a typical beachfront stand alone hotel and you will be happy happy happy.", "Date": "January 18, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "1.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Toledo, Illinois", "Title": "\u201cNightmare!\u201d", "Author": "Teddybear87", "ReviewID": "UR12447237", "Content": "This is a joke of a hotel.

The bathroom had a moldy, leaking vent that leaked on the toilet seat constantly (when you were sitting on the toilet, it leaked on your head!) Both rooms had disgusting floors.

First thing we arrived 2 days early and asked if we could check in early and extend our original stay to 5 days in total, this was not a problem I was told it would be $218 for 2 additional nights by the front desk man. He ran my card, told me a room number and then after 5 minutes of walking around like he was lost he come back and told me the rate just went up to $179 a night because it is race week and it would now be an additional $140 ontop of the $218 I just paid. I am a pretty easy guy to get along with however this was just plain dirty and underhand. After 10 minutes of telling him and his co worker that this was unacceptable and they cant bait and switch like that I demanded a manager. The manager didnt even come to see me however I was given the room for $109. The hotel from the outside isnt very pretty however once you step into the lobby it really looks good, the gift shop is very nice and they have a nice arcade with a good selection of games for the kids and the pool is very large and looks pretty clean as well. I have to agree 100% with the other people who have said their is a smell in the hotel, you dont notice it in the lobby however once you step off the elevator into the main hall (5th floor anyway) you definetly do notice it. The halls look okay, a bit run down but clean none the less. Our room was a let down, the door that takes you out to the balcony (fantastic view) was rotten on the bottom and once you step out onto the balcony dont look lean out over the edge because you will get wet from the dripping AC unit thats located on the floor above you, I also had some safety concerns with the balcony rails, they seemed very lose and didnt feel like they were secure. the side of the box spring of our bed had a huge stain (similar to a rust stain) all the way down the side of it, the bed was definetly old and had been in the room for quite some time, also the hairdryer in the bathroom had shorted out (probably the previous guest) the hotel promptly replaced the hairdryer once informed about it. Our toilet had a wooden wedge under it to keep it in possition however when you sit down on the toilet it would wobble around like it was going to fall over. Also the AC unit was very dirty and needed cleaned as well as the huge patch of mold in the bathroom on the ceiling. After my 2nd night, the hotel informed me that they did not have the hotwire request and I needed to bring them proof that I had paid hotwire, lucky I had my laptop and mobile printer ( we work alot on the road ) so I printed the info out for them and walked down to the lobby, when I handed the lady at the desk the info she looked at me weird and said there was no problem and I didnt need to bring i down. Speaking of internet, It was down more than up, My wife called the front desk and she was told that it would be down for a few days. A few minutes later it was working again. Very few of the hosekeeping staff speak or even understand english, my wife and i attempted to find directions to the guest laundy (which is located outside of the hotel near the pool) and I was told by a gentleman (housekeeper) that he did not know where it was. Overall I am very dissapointed with this hotel, It is not a 3 star hotel as advertised, The lobby looks 3 or 4 star however the rooms are definetly not.", "Date": "July 3, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "4.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Unknown", "Title": "\u201cFriendliest people I encountered in Florida.\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR5407336", "Content": "We stayed our first 6 days in Orlando at a supposedy 5 star resort and it was the most miserable place I've ever been.
