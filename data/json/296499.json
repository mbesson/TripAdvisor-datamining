The move actually turned out really well - arrived around 11:30pm so Alessio came to meet us at Piazzale Roma and walked us the 5 mins to the hotel. Great service from him. The place itself has good sized rooms, bathroom is small but wasn't a problem for us. The only issue we had were a leaky a/c unit and no hairdryer in the room, but both sorted quickly with no fuss. Location is the main selling point, easy to find when you arrive in Venice and is also pretty easy to navigate back to when roaming the Venice streets! Overall a good place to stay for a few nights at a decent rate", "Date": "August 29, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Service": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Victoria, Canada", "Title": "\u201cBest location and it had A/C\u201d", "Author": "BudgetTraveler010", "ReviewID": "UR117298272", "Content": "I had a difficult time finding a room in Venice that would accommodate our party of 4. I was travelling with my teenage daughters and didn't want to be separated in different rooms. When we arrived in Venice we really had nt idea how to get to the hotel but turned out to be close to the Rialto Bridge and the train station. One of the advantages of this hotel was that we didn't have to carry/drag our luggage though the winding alleys and frequent bridges of Venice. When we arrived we were greeeted by the Albergo who we had sent an email to the night before telling him of our approximate arrival time. In the ad for the hotel they ask that you phone when you arrive but we didn't have phones but we did have internet the night before and he was quick to answer. The room wasn't big but it was big enough for us. My daughers were happy with the bunk beds. The hotel is well situated as far as getting around the city. We were able to get to San Marco Square in about 15 minutes once we knew where we were going (thank you to the person who put arrows on the building!) We were also very grateful for the air conditioning in the room. Only one criticism would be that the breakfast that was included was not adequate. A coffee and a bun was about all there was offered, although the coffee was very good, it was not enough to start the day with. Other than that, I would definitely stay here again.", "Date": "August 26, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Zurzach, Switzerland", "Title": "\u201cGreat Location, Great Accommodation, in Venice\u201d", "Author": "kirley8", "ReviewID": "UR115443251", "Content": "I was traveling with my friend Deb and her 2 daughters, age 18 and 15. It was a real challenge to find accommodations that could handle 4 people in a room, let alone one in Venice. The Hotel Tolentini, was very accommodating. The room was a good size, king bed, with bunk beds on the side. We all slept very comfortably, we had a small fridge to keep the girls pop and our wine cold :) Also the bathroom was very clean, good supply of towels (bring your own shampoo and rinse, there were not enough for 4 girls). You were given breakfast coupons that you could use for a coffee (capachino or macciatto, or orange juice) and a bun or croissant, at a local coffe shop steps away under a tree in the courtyard of the walk way. The location was very easy to find from the train station, which was very handy as we had a lot of luggage to drag around and it was appreciated that we only had about 10 minutes to walk from the station (over a few bridges) to the hotel.

Anyway, it was what I had expected: a modest place near the bus station, the railway station and vaporetto stop. There're also some important attractions very near the hotel: Scuola di San Rocco, the churches of San Rocco and Frari etc. The room was basic, a little bit shabby and quite small. It hadn't been cleaned complitely before my arrival. The surprising thing was that the shower wasn't in the bathroom but in the room, although covered by glaswalls and curtain. There's no breakfast available in the hotel, but just around the corner there's a coffee bar. The street beneath the windows is quite noisy, so that might disturb some guests. During my stay of four days I just met the receptionist twice, so last day after having to leave the room I had to take the luggage to safe in the railway station (my plane left in the evening). Hotel ai Tolentini is not a good choice for a romantic holiday in Venice, but for those who want to move around it's a good option with a reasonable price.", "Date": "March 18, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Edegem, Belgium", "Title": "\u201cVery simple hotel in croudy neighborhood\u201d", "Author": "Dries2505", "ReviewID": "UR79192896", "Content": "We stayed there for 4 nights in (I guess) one of the cheapest rooms. 70 euros per night. Of course this is without any breakfast. On our arrival, the guy (he wasn't the owner) spoke that they can offer a breakfast at 5 euros per person per day, but when we agreed to it (at least for the first morning), he told us that it was better to take our breakfast somewhere near the San Marco square. So, strange that he offered us breakfast when he doesn't was to deliver it when you agree to it. For the rest, the hotel had just done some renovation and in the hallways you could still see the results of the renovation on some spots. We had a room which was just on top of the restaurant next to the hotel. So, saterurday night we had a lot of noise of their customers until 2 or 3 in the morning. Please note that from 6 in the Morning, Venice starts to come alive. The benefit of the room, was that it was supplied with 2 venitaltors to get some air circulation (it needed in the summer). The walls of the hotel are quite thin, since our neighbors left monday morning very early and spent the whole night chatting and packing.

I've heard there are actually two buildings to the hotel, so room quality may vary based on which building you're in. We were in the building where the reception is located, and our bathroom was pretty old-school, but everything was quite clean. The room was furnished in an Ikea style - nothing fancy, but all new and nice. Although the hotel is on a fairly busy pedestrian path, the noise was never a problem to us.
