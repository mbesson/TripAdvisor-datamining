It is not a hotel, its hardly a B&B,... but it is wonderfull. Only 5 or 6 rooms, all very pleasant and interesting, the smallest lobby ever where Zaiga spends her days on I think about 2 square meters,.. I would recommend it to everyone who doesn't need, like or wants a real hotel.

Absolutely the best thing about this accommodation is its location - literally around the corner from Spanish Steps (and Spanish Spetps metro station), 2mins to Via del Corso, 10mins to Piazza Navona and 15mins to the Vatican City State. Rooms are compact but it's a norm in Rome. It is also very clean since the place was only opened in May 2011 and everything is brand new. The white walls and decor will probably wear out quickly though. We stayed in iCube - the bed was very comfortable, changing lights were super cool and the room's only fault was the shower that kind of floods the floor when you are not super careful. iPad for the guest use in the room is a nice touch (WiFi worked well on all devices) and you are aloud to take the iPad with you while you visit the city. Zaiga who greeted and showed us around couldn't have been more helpful! I actually really liked the idea of a breakfast in a Cafe next door. The place is so close that even on a rainy day it wouldn't be a bothersome prospect. La Bouvette is a small Italian cafe where you can see locals having their cappuccino in the morning and espresso during the day. You can choose to up to three items per person, which is absolutely enough. For the two of us we had 3 coffees, 2 sandwiches and a cake to share. I highly recommend the place for anybody who like the minimalist and nontraditional hotel rooms.", "Date": "February 13, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cEXCELLENT!!\u201d", "Author": "flomus", "ReviewID": "UR123997266", "Content": "This B&B is more than that.

Very luxurious, we were in the best rooms with a great big Jacuzzi, but we think that for that price... They should make some easy improvement: in the rooms there isn't any possibility to make a coffee or a the, we had to ask twice to have enough towels for the bathroom, the hairdryier was badly working, and for breakfast ( in the lovely cafe at the other side of the street) you can only choose 3 products in total between drinks and food. The quality was very good but here we are again: for 400 per night they could give something more.

You enter through a door right on the street, climb a flight of stairs, and there it is. No Lobby or reception area. Ziaga, the hotel manager (owner) was there to greet us, and she was a delight, full of life and buzzing with energy. We were checked in in a jiffy. Thank you Zaiga for all the directions! The rooms we had was large, with a very comfortable bed, a large bathroom, a great shower with a built in jacuzzi. The room was cleaned on a daily basis to a high standard. Breakfast was at the Buvette (I Think), a typical Italian cafe, that was exactly 4 steps across from the Hotel's main door. You can choose any two pieces with a coffee, and the sandwiches were humungous, and very yummy Italian cold cuts. The location is absolutely perfect and unbeatable, right in the middle of everything. You can walk anywhere and everywhere, with the Spanish steps a stone's throw away and the Forum and Coloseum a mere 20 minute walk. So if you are looking to be out & about and enjoy toom, and come back to your own clean & comfy room, then I high recommend iRooms for its no frills convenience.", "Date": "December 17, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "5.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Ottawa, Canada", "Title": "\u201cFantastic hotel with friendly service!\u201d", "Author": "MaryMarie29", "ReviewID": "UR121393369", "Content": "I echo the other reviewers-- this place is great.
