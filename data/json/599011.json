The room was a very pleasant surprise, with fresh white paint, sublime decor, festive towel presentation, a spacious bathroom and comfortable beds. Though there was no natural light to speak of from the window to the backyard, it still felt airy and bright, and the thorough daily room maintance made it a joy to return sweaty and sandy from the beach every afternoon. Of course, the hotel offers little in the way of amenities, except for the coffee machine and couch in the tropical communal garden, and you have to go elsewhere for a pool area and breakfast, which are both on offer at the AquaLunas larger sister hotel further up the street, but were an unattractive option since you can get a better breakfast at the same price elsewhere in Playa (and have way more fun at the beach). What the AquaLuna does offer is a friendly, safe, quiet, affordable and excellently located base for those who wish to enjoy and explore Playa del Carmen and the surrounding area without blowing the budget. During our stay here we had absolutely no complaints, and found the hotel to be delivering on all of it's promises, thus being a hidden gem in a city where you often have to pay for more than you actually get.", "Date": "September 20, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Manchester, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cMuchas Gracias\u201d", "Author": "Gemma Q", "ReviewID": "UR117137093", "Content": "Couldn't have been more helpful!

You have to read what they did for me. So I am not big on doing these reviews but after this visit on my big birthday I had to write about what they did.

Second we get a nice breakfast and access to the Mamita Beach club with fresh towels each day. We get wireless or can enjoy the PC access in the garden coffee spot with nice chairs to unwind. Now the gal Rosy that did the rooms each day for us was a Gem already and each day we got fun little things done on the bed with towel designs etc. Now how they knew it was my Birthday I am not sure. I think it was the cards in the room but when we got back from or Yard glass Margarita run at La Parilla (a must) we come in the room and our bed is decorated like a cake. Yeahh a cake (see pic) not only that but ballons and banners etc roses from Rosy and a card signed by all the staff. What.. yeah... all signed this card. Up to this point they were already so wonderful and helpful with our queries of the area. Really this was so so very special for my special day.

Everyone we interacted with was VERY friendly, very helpful and really went above and beyond to make our stay enjoyable. On the day of our departure, one of the staff brought us sandwiches to take to the airport with us to avoid having to pay for expensive airport food. And, Marco was so welcoming and friendly and had such a positive energy. He really made us feel at home. The rooms were clean and simple, which is all we really needed. We didn't travel to Mexico to stay in the hotel all day. Our goal was to get out, experience the city, spend time on the beach and take an adventure. Aqualuna was a perfect fit. It was a quiet sanctuary for us to relax at the end of our days, off the main strip but close enough to easily access the beach and 5th ave. with a short walk. The room attendant kept our room clean and organized and added special touches that gave us a smile when we returned \"home\" each night. The breakfast at the sister hotel wasn't amazing, but there were plenty of restaurants in the area. We actually preferred trying new restaurants for breakfast each day versus eating at the sister hotel every morning. We really enjoyed Karma Bagels.

We left the hotel totally underwhelmed. THE GOOD The hotel definitely had some good points, all apparent right upon arriving to the hotel: perfect location and wonderful staff. The location on 10th Avenue meant being close to the action on 5th Avenue without actually being on 5th Ave in the middle of all the the hubbub. 5th Avenue is quite long, almost a mile I would say, and Aqualuna is roughly halfway down the street, making it very convenient. It's also two blocks from several beach clubs. There was some street noise at night but the rooms were on the back side on the building away from the street, and the courtyard filled with trees and plants muffled most of the noise. The staff was definitely the best part of the hotel. Very friendly and trusting with great recommendations on things to do in the area. They even lent us beach towels for the day after we had checked out! Aqualuna doesn't have a Spa, but they have a lady who gives massages at their sister hotel down the street and I highly recommend it. She was wonderful and at $70 for a 90-minute massage, you really can't beat the price. THE MEDIOCRE The room was \"meh,\" plain white walls and bedcoverings, flimsy closet and little shelf space. The room was definitely \"basic.\" The TV was teeny, but we never turned it on. A/C was good, which is important. The bathroom amenities were organic but the exfoliating soap was a little rough. THE POOR There were a couple of areas which really brought down our opinion of the whole hotel. The breakfast is not served at the Aqualuna but at their sister hotel about three blocks away. This was no big deal, they gave us a ticket which we turned in over at the other hotel. However, the \"hacienda style buffet\" was anything but. There were exactly four hot items, two of which were either empty or of questionable quality (ie, ham & cheese sandwich on sliced bread and billed as \"panini\"). There were three juice containers, usually empty, as well as serve-yourself coffee and milk (milk was also out), fruit, bread, and yogurt. There were some staff members running around but no one ever greeted us or ever approached our table in three days. Meanwhile, we saw them profusely welcome a large group that came in and offer to make them anything they wanted to-order. I did order a cappuccino at the bar, and it appeared on our bill at the end of the stay. On our last day we went out to breakfast, even though we had already paid for it at the hotel. The shower was another area that was disappointing at least, frustrating at most. It is a large rainshower, but the showerhead is so calcified that the water sprays randomly in all directions (\"like real raindrops!\" my husband said). It was impossible to get clean. Also the drain filter was loose and popped out once in the middle of a shower. Not to mention that the water never got above lukewarm. I tried to use the hose-like implement that was installed in the shower, in an attempt for better water pressure, but for some reason the water coming out of the hose was always freezing cold, regardless of the temperature of the water from the showerhead. The third area that I would definitely rate as poor was the bed quality. This was easily the hardest bed I've ever slept on, and that's saying something considering that I have traveled extensively throughout Mexico, land of firm beds. There were two tiny pillows. CONCLUSION I really want to recommend this hotel based on the wonderful staff who really made our weekend great, but I just can't. Even if we hadn't gotten the breakfast, I just don't think the hotel is worth the $80 rate advertised on their website this time of year ($100 with breakfast). Even if you just need a clean room, the hard bed and crazy shower make me have to give it a thumbs down.", "Date": "March 22, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "vancouver", "Title": "\u201cgreat service and location\u201d", "Author": "grandslam2010", "ReviewID": "UR100501678", "Content": "This hotel was perfect for us.

The Aqualuna hotel is small but I would give it a 5 star rating because if you understand what you are getting for the price it is top notch, one of the best hotels I have found. Because of my recent experience I am just going to plan another two weeks with them next year. The staff are great, you could not ask for a nicer group of people and clearly they are there to help you have a good experience. The hotel is only two small blocks from the beach and is safe and secure. You have a \"hard\" bed according to fat American standards, but you have to understand that the bed is built into the structure because it helps make it hurricane compatible. The mattress is good, you'll get used to it. Plenty of hot water, nice shower, clean bathroom, cable tv, mini fridge for my beer and juice, and in room air conditioner. They also have a pool at a sister hotel a few blocks away but I preferred the beach and ocean. What I learned in Playa was that basically you'll pay an extra $10 for each add on, pool in a courtyard, add another $10, on site restaurant, add another $10. Etc. It would be easy to double the price and end up paying for your own laziness. By that I mean, if you can't walk two blocks to a pool you are too lazy. If you can't walk across the street to one of many restaurants, you are too lazy. The location of Aqualuna is on a fairly busy street, 10 ave, so you will hear the morning traffic starting to build up around 6:30 - 7:00 am. But in the winter time the daylight is 7:00 - 5:00, so consider the wakeup traffic a plus, not a minus. You're there to enjoy and should not be wasting daylight. If you like to party late and sleep in, pick a more expensive hotel that is more isolated. If you like to get up and go, it is the perfect place. Just a short walk of one block and you are on 5 ave, that's the main cobblestone/brick walk where all of the shops and restaurants are. Remember that on the map the streets go in 5's, so each single block is 5 more than the last one. For example, 10 ave is only two blocks from the beach. It goes, 10 ave, 5 ave, beach. So the location of Aqualuna is really right where you want to be in the first place. Why pay more to be closer. Also, a lot of the shops cater to western tourists, so there is much cheaper and probably better tasting food in the higher numbered streets where you start to see locals eating. For example a breakfast on 5 ave, say $10, becomes $5 on 15 ave or 20 ave, and that's only 3 blocks!! Also, the same is true for shopping, find what you like but don't buy it, walk a few blocks \"away\" from the tourist zone, and you'll find better bargains. I'm not really a bargain shopper, but I wanted to point this out for all you considering Playa. In my opinion, don't bother renting a car, the bus system is top notch, large comfortable air conditioned buses drive every 50 minutes from Playa to the south like Tulum. The bus costs $4-5 depending on destination. Buses to and from Cancun run more frequently. My writing here is a little bit like a tourist guide, but I wanted to portray a low cost vacation that you can have by staying at a good hotel and using local knowledge. The Aqualuna hotel is now one of my favorites, if you're not a snobby spoiled tourist you'll really appreciate this jewel in Playa. You won't be disappointed.

What follows is a long list of what is great about the hotel, but here are a couple brief \"negative marks\": -Bed was very hard and this gave my b/f some back issues -Not enough pillows, though more were provided on request The Aqualuna is the perfect place for such travelers, who don't need a lot of hand holding but do need a good touch of elegance, European hospitality, and the basic amenities to make their stay relaxing. It allows you a nice home base from which to explore, knowing that when you come back from a crazy day exploring nature preserves, that your sparkling clean room with AC will be there waiting for you. At this hotel you don't get a bunch of things you don't need like a huge rec room or elevator, and therefore these are not factored into the cost of the room. However, laundry service, in-room phone, concierge, luggage storing, towel service, breakfast (at sister hotel), pool (at sister hotel), yoga/massage (at sister hotel) and organized tours are all available. The hotel is physically very attractive--a whitewashed Grecian island-esque building on the corner of Avenida 10 and Calle 14, it is within a minute's walk of the crazy pedestrian walk \"La Quinta\" and still feels like a world away from the commercial side of playa. There is a covered open-air rec area in the atrium of the hotel, replete with palms and other tropical plants, where you can get filtered water and make coffee, surf the internet, or chill out on the chaise (and smoke if you like). I should mention this area looks more like a hip club than like a typical hotel common room. The in-room amenities were delightful. The shampoo/soaps were all locally made and the Mayan honey shampoo smelled so good and was rich that I would have bought a larger size if it was on sale. The green herb-infused body was was also excellent and smelled a little bit like the aperitif Chartreuse. In our room, we were greeted daily with varying types of towel sculptures, including a huge towel swan complete with googly eyes. Clearly someone on staff has an inner artist manifesting in the form of towel design. Gaspar, our host, was exceedingly welcoming and accomodating and answered all of our questions, including that of street parking (we rented a car for our week in Mexico) and shopping (there are huge American style mega stores nearby). Just next door there are two cute taquerias to satisfy your snacking urges. We recommend the rice-less burrito. A little further South down 10th Ave betw 8th/10th c, there is a little taqueria/juice stand called \"Kiwi\" which has excellent huge $2 fruit shakes and really good tacos. At the end of our trip, we finally did succumb to the pleasures of the beach, which the hotel happily supports by its liaison with the Mamitas Beach Club (something like $5 for a beach chair and umbrella for 2 people per day). Mamitas is a little bit of a walk away but is a very nice and Euro beach. Great people watching and very nice swimming. We booked the room on Expedia as an package deal (with air, hotel, and car) and I found this to be a great option as we had very few extra costs to pay at the stay - just the beach club costs and an optional donation to the social services charity that the Hotel subsidizes (a very worthwhile cause, especially if you get the chance to visit any of the Maya communities further inland). Each night was about $45 in the off season of mid-May. What a steal! Sometimes they have sales on their website if you book direct ahead of time.

Um, with all due respect: duh. Playa del Carmen has developed very quickly, and now has plenty of overpriced, underperforming (or noisy!) accommodations, especially on the beach and on Avenida 5. Aqualuna is the perfect antidote to this. If you're an experienced international traveler, and looking for something that provides a great balance of quality, value and convenience, this is a really outstanding option. All in all, an excellent value, and we were mostly quite charmed by the attractive facility and nice people. Not luxurious, but well done. But if you're maybe new to places like Mexico, and prefer big chain hotels when you travel domestically, you'll probably prefer another option. Rooms are spacious and attractive, in the local style of whitewashed concrete or stucco. This isn't everyone's cup of tea, but seems just right for the beach. Desk service is very good and very helpful, but remember that it's a small hotel. For instance, they sometimes have to run around the corner to their sister property to process a credit card transaction. This is pretty standard for the developing world, but these guys hustle when they do it, explain what's happening, and apologize for the inconvenience. Just right. Why pay double or triple at a big resort-y place to save the 5 minutes? The rooms aren't plush or anything, but have all the basics you need, including Wi-Fi and a flat-screen TV. There's a safe big enough for a netbook, a fridge, etc. I think beds should always err on the side of firm over soft, but this one might be a touch firmer than is really necessary. Good, but stiff. Bathrooms are good. Power was reliable. They provide plenty of bottled water. The common areas are quite lovely and peaceful outdoor spaces to hang out. The location is outstanding, as it's just far enough off of Avenida 5 to be quiet, and just close enough to the services there that you never mind the walk. Also, it's far enough north to get past the tackier, busier parts of the town. The best restaurants and bars are very close by. (John Gray's is pricey, but well worth a visit. Wonderful lamb with Asian slaw! Plus, the taco van on 12th st. is super-cute, providing great tacos and excellent cheap breakfasts. ) Note that there is a road in front, and some rooms are close to the 'lobby', as it's a small hotel. So, if you're a light sleeper... just ask for a quiet room if you need one. I think we were in #8, which was interior and super quiet. We took advantage of the Yoga classes at their nearby sister hotel and strongly recommend them. The instructors are very nice, and technically are probably just above average, but the outdoor, upstairs studio is gorgeous: breezes, green trees, birds chirping. A glorious way to start the day. Also, the beach club access they provide gets you a nice chair & umbrella at a place a 15 min. walk away. It's nothing glorious, but a nice freebie. If you just want to swim, no need to bother with that: just walk straight to the nearest beach. But it's a nice place to spend an afternoon reading in the shade, or sunning yourself. If we had any real gripe, it would be the ditzy housekeeping. On my second day, I walked into my room hoping to use the restroom. The housekeeper was in the middle of cleaning. I used my basic Spanish to indicate I needed the bano. Instead of letting me use the loo quickly, she finished up for 10 min. while I waited in the hall. And she never pointed me to the now-obvious restrooms down by reception. Someone was also there on our last day while we were trying to depart. We explained that we were packing to go, and she just nodded and kept working. Had to ask her to leave and come back after we left. No big deal, but an inconvenience they could easily improve.

The hotel is situated on 10th, just one block from the busy walking street of 5th Ave. with its restaurants and stores. After you enter to the front desk, the curving paths, trees and plants and little seating area in white stucco make for a little hideaway from the bustle of the street. There you'll find bottled water, and a coffee pot. You are essentially still outside, as you proceed to the door of your room either on ground level or up an outside stucco stairway. We had 2 rooms separated by a little path, with a queen bed in each off this lovely courtyard. The rooms each featured a small, wall-mounted flat screen TV, over a little desk area; a comfortable, if a bit hard, bed with bedside buit-in tables/luggage shelves; nice painted-porcelain bowl sink area next to closet space with robes and a mini-bar and safe, outside a bathroom complete with walk in shower area and toilet. The hotel is a sister hotel to Karma hotel (just one block away, on 15th) and Hacienda Paradise (about 3 blocks away on 10th) where you can walk for your breakfast buffet. Although this hotel basically just has one front desk person, they seem to share facilities with the sister hotels. I think you can take a dip at the tiny pool at Karma or probably Hacienda Paradise's larger pool, as Aqualuna doesn't have a pool. The front desk will issue you a beach towel and they have vouchers for beach chairs and umbrella from Mamita's Beach Club, which you'll find off 28th after a walk to the white sand beach. They let us use the front desk computer for a quick check of email.

If you're looking for a more \"americanized, fast-food type of resort\" this is NOT your place.", "Date": "December 12, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Cape Town, South Africa", "Title": "\u201cLoved the Aqualuna\u201d", "Author": "vgriffiths", "ReviewID": "UR8266755", "Content": "We had a fantastic stay at Aqualuna. The friendly staff gave us excellent service. We stayed at two designer hotels on 5th Avenue but with all the noise until 3am, we decided to book in at Aqualuna for the remainder of our stay. They upgraded our room and gave us a discount. The building style is tastefully Mexican with a beautiful tropical garden. And its just a short walk to the beach.
