The bathroom was huge, by European standards... and even by spoiled American standards! The tub was full sized and deep! Towels were plush and oversized.

We were misplaced in a wrong room, and were just told to pack our suitcases and go to the reception. I would have expected them to offer to move for us.

It is unacceptable that they don't install heaters between the windows and the tables.

We spend a total of 2\u00c2\u00bd hours for a 3 course meal in a restaurant only half full. Steak ordered medium-rare was served well-done, but was replaced within minutes (another customer had to wait for his dinner then). Dinner was overall good. Breakfast was not impressive, but had a reasonalble variety of choices to pick from. Staff in reception was both arrogant and rude when I had to rush them for a taxi they clearly had forgotten to order. Initially they claimed that time was only one minutes past, when it really was almost 5 minutes later \"The computer says so\". I allmost was late for business meeting. Only one of 3 receptionists was allowed to call for taxis (Just imagine - they have a \"Taxi manager\"). I have no intensions of using the hotel again - mainly because of the poor service. I could have accepted all the minor mistakes - they happens, but not with this level of service. Before visiting Amsterdam, I was twice in UK and stayed both times at Hilton hotels.

The front of the hotel fares a lot better, but it is the side/back view you are first faced with when approaching the hotel. Inside the lobby and bar area it was a different story. Lovely warm feel with friendly staff. There was no queue for check in and it was all very smooth. Picked up a couple of drinks from the bar and headed up to the room. I booked an executive room, with late check out for 179euros on a Saturday night, direct through the hotels website. The executive room was disappointingly small and very worn around the edges, although overall it did seem very cosy, if a little hot.

However this year i must admit to being a bit disappointed. Firstly, the plus points. Location is great, entrance/bar etc are lovely, and all of the staff are extremely helpful and pleasant. The rooms again are always excellent, spacious, and very clean. The beds are also really good and comfortable. However, I did think this year that it looks as if it could do with a bit of an update. The furnishings etc (especially carpets and wallpaper in the corridors) are beginning to look a bit jaded and worn. Now - the food. We have eaten on a few occasions in the restaurant - but found that the menu barely changed from year to year. Yes it was good, but very expensive and not a great deal of choice. The breakfast however is a complete rip-off. Twenty two euros per person, and honestly very poor for half of that. We have tried it in the past and been not too keen, but as we were on a tight timescale our first day i chose to try the hot buffet - which was anything but hot. Sausage, scrambled eggs, bacon, mushrooms - all were cold (not just lukewarm, actually cold). We were in a hurry to get to an exhibition in the RAI that morning so really didnt have time to start complaining etc - we ended up just choosing from the continental buffet selection - which again is WAY overpriced for whats available. A very average selection of breads/meats and cheeses - not bad but nothing to write home about, and certainly not worth the price of a decent steak! If 2* hotels are able to keep hot breakfast options hot, then there is no reason why a hotel charging twenty two euros cannot. We chose to have breakfast in a variety of places over the rest of our stay - all far better in terms of quality and selection, and all for less than half the price.

Both not true. This hotel is located in a nice, seemingly very safe residential neighbourhood, but the hotel was a letdown. In terms of location it's definitely not as centrally located as I would have liked. I was only here for two nights, so it wasn't so bad, but if I had been here for longer the location would have disapponted me. It's a short 15-20 minute tram ride into the centre of town, but it's within walking distance of nowhere. There are not really any nearby restaurants, and nothing to do that's within a walk. I got the impression it was far more central, but this really is out there in the sticks. I would definitely have paid a bit extra for someone with more hustle and bustle if I'd known this hotel was so far away from everything. The hotel staff were nice enough, no problems, and helpful with directions. Amsterdam seems like a great place, only I think I would have soaked up far more of the atmosphere and had a much better time if I'd stayed somewhere more centrally located. The room itself was a real disappointment. It was no way five star. I have stayed in three stars that are better than this. It was small, the windows weren't that clean, and I couldn't even open the windows because they were locked. The view was nothing to speak of. Although there was a really irritating piece of metalwork right outside my hotel room. You see, there was a little park area outside, and they had this metal contraption there that was meant to be an art work. Every hour, on the hour, it would creak and ring it's bell for about ten minutes. Often waking me, and even in the morning this was simply annoying. The shower was a dissapointment too. Yes the water was hot, but the shower screen was loose, so after I left my shower to run for a bit so the water would get warm, I realised the whole bathroom was flooded because the shower screen had gaps where it had been attached. Luckily I was only there for two days, so didn't have to put up with a flooded bathroom for long. Even the kettle didn't work properly. I think it's the longest time I have ever waited for a kettle to boil - it took about 15 mins. All in all, this place was not what I wanted, I would have paid a bit extra for better, as I think I would have enjoyed Amsterdam far more. And just for the record, I'm not usually a complainer. I have stayed at many hotels and not really had a bad word to say about any of them. But...here...it wasn't the very worst hotel you could get...but it was certainly enough to put a dampener on my stay in Amsterdam. I think if you really want to see the city, then don't stay here.

The receptionist said that this is what they called a double room. I told her that no hotel in the world calls two single beds a double room and their terminology was incorrect and that perhaps they should change the wording on the website. (After reading other reviews it seems this trick is pulled quite regularly). She wanted to charge me \u00c2\u00a350 to upgrade to an executive room. I refused. Eventually she said we could move the two beds together and that for our second night she would move us into a room with a double bed.

I have never encountered this before. The next day our room took a long time to be ready. When we finally got the keys I noticed that it wasn't an executive room as it didn't have a whirlpool bath but it was in fact a deluxe room with a double bed (which is exactly what we had wanted in the first place). When we checked out, the receptionist tried to charge us for a dog in our room which was ironic! As we were getting ready to leave four poor jet-lagged americans had arrived and they couldn't find their reservation at the reception. They had to pay to use the internet to print out the confirmation of their booking. The reception staff were totally incompetent. I must add I found the restaurant/breakfast staff to be very helpful and friendly as were the bar staff. The same can't be said for the receptionist's who never smiled and rarely tried to help.

It looked like an intimate hotel, located in the trendy suburbs of the city. It was an atypical setting from the one had in mind from the outset of the trip The entrance of the hotel had small dining areas located outside and inside the building. The outside cafe' dining had linen clothed tables setup with wicker chairs. The wine glasses were displayed upside down, almost as if they were anticipating the arrival of people that evening. The table clothes flew up as an unpredictable gust of wind wafted on the clear summer afternoon; the table setups tried to protect the modesty of the legs of the tables, but all of the attempts were in vain. Another small bar was set up with crystal wine glasses on a clean, white table cloth. They looked like a row of clear, glass tulips. The inside dining room was totally surrounded by glass door walls that were opened up to expose the large cherry slat wood floor. One really had to look closely to distinguish the inside from the outside, as no barriers seemed to exist. And it was at this hotel that an American woman's inhibitions, in the sultry July in sexually liberated Amsterdam, that intense lessons in love all came together in an intimate tale of romance & self discovery. Amsterdam leveled the playing field when it came to sexual inequality women face in America due to Puritanical judgement. No one could predict that the trip would entail embarking on the most intimate journey, encountering a European man and their unexpected adventure full of life & love lessons. The inside bar was small, intimate and full of people, on business and vacation, from all walks of life. Just sit at the bar and join people you do not know, to get to know the lives of others, in order to enjoy the real life. One can always take tours of museums and site seeing when they are retired on a tour guide. But for younger people wanting to explore, eat, drink, party and socialize, then this true Dutch Hotel is a good start. We loved Jazz and wanted to go to the Bimhaus in the Red Light District - but it was always closed. I would avoid the area of Leiderstraat unless you want to go to a casual area with a loud noises. The Orleans House is a great bar and has an eclectic menu and beautiful architectural structures. Near the hotel is an intimate Italian restaurant, the Bella Vista. It has seating in and outside the tree lined streets; the food and service is excellent. The Bilderberg Garden Hotel also boasts having a five star restaurant, which I can verify.

The hotel offers excellent value and great five star service, particularly when compared with other smaller, more impersonal hotels in the center of Amsterdam. The rooms are spacious - in our experience more so than others, particularly the executive rooms. The breakfast was varied, plentiful & delicious. The hotel is not located right in the center of Amsterdam, however, it is only a very short tram ride away from all the main attractions. In our opinion, the hotel's location is a benefit since it means we have a 5 star hotel, with spacious rooms, at a very affordable price. We were particularly impressed with the hotel this time round as a result of the flexibility they offered when our flight to Amsterdam was canceled due to the snow at Heathrow. We'd pre paid our hotel reservation via Expedia back in Oct and booked at a rate which prohibited changes or cancellation. When our flight was canceled the hotel could have simply refused to help & we'd have been stuck having to pay for another reservation. However, they were very reasonable and helped us as much as possible. As a result, we were able to re-book with no penalty and thus, we were extremely grateful for their help, professionalism and flexibility in difficult circumstances.

We thoroughly enjoyed our stay at the Bilderberg and our experience of Amsterdam. We were fortunate in accessing a very good package deal at the hotel (inc breakfast on 2 mornings and 1 evening dinner for both of us) which in the main was very very good value for money. From Schipol airport, the hotel which is tucked away in a highly desirable Amsterdam suburb of pristine streets, tree lined avenues, tidy homes, delighful shops, tasty eateriees and tranquility beyond any that I has experienced in any other European city, is just a short bus ride/taxi ride away (Connexion Hotel shuttle is 15 euro per person which I thought a little expensive but worth it to avoid the hasstle) . The tram network is very close by and the city centre, museums, churches, cathedrals, galleries and all other places of interest are within a short trip - pick up a 24 hour tram ticket (7 euros per person)from hotel reception and save yourself a bundles of euros! Check-in when we arrived was conducted in an effortless fashion by a trainee receptionist and when she did have a slight problem the reception manager Zoe was on hand immediately to smooth over and rectify the minor issue - wonderful - we all have to learn and this young lady was certainly getting an excellent mentoring from the manager at reception! The hotel rooms are spacious and comfortable, nice beds and bedding (excellent pillows) with plenty of towels, toiletries, tea/coffee, information and use of robes and lounging slippers. Breakfast is a very adequate buffet giving plenty of choice in terms of cereals, breads (both sweet and savoury), fruit, hams, cheeses, yogurts, juices, eggs (although the boiled eggs are more cool than hot, but each to their own) and warm rather than hot are the sausages/musrooms and grilled tomatoes. I would love to be able to report on the quaility of the food in the restaurant in the evening but unfortunately even though we were scheduled to have dinner we didn't! I booked dinner for early evening, indeed we were so early, we were infact the first guests to present to eat. Eating off the 'set menu' (from the package) prooved impossible for me as it was less than expansive given that there was only 3 main courses to choose from - not bad you might say - but given that they were all fish dishes, not much good if you are allergic to fish as I am! The waiter did ask the chef if there was any additional choicewhich could be offered - there was, 1, which was 'beef tail' - not the best cut of meat and certainly not for my pallete. The only other option that was then offered was the opportunity to choose from the 'a la catre' menu at an additional charge - which given the cost involved in this 'upgrade', was nt an option at all. As my son was not going to eat on his own we decided to forego the 'dinnin experience' at dinner and on hearing this the waiter was absolutely incredulous and was clearly less than pleased, to say he was 'miffed' and had a little 'huff' to himself would be an understatement - but I am made or sterner stuff than that and was not about to be intimidated into selecting food that I knew i couldn't or wouldn't eat. We left and found a wonderful restaurant within 5 minutes walk where we both ate for less than the cost it would have been for 1 of us to upgrade to the 'a la carte' menu at the hotel. I don't doubt that the food at the hotel would have been superb (as at breakfast) but the chef needs to realise that offering 3 variations of one meat genre is not offering real choice. A little more training for the waiter in the finer art of customer care and speaking only when required to, would not go amiss. I would also recommend another wonderful 'eateree' , Cafe Leoitja very close by, as the best steak I have eaten in a very long time - mmmmmmmmmmmmmm! Checking out from the hotel was destined to be a problem as the receptionist was not prepared to provide for a discount for the inability of the restaurant to offer a suitable meal choice for our dinner, but I am afraid that this reviewer was not abut to accept that position. I asked for the opportunity to speak to the reception manager and as if by magic, Zoe (above) apeared - 5 minutes later - an agreed discount and check out copmpleted, tidyily and efficiently - WELL DONE Zoe! My ratings for the hotel are: Hotel overall - 9/10, Breakfast quality - 8/10, Dinner - no suitable choice of food on the 'set menu' and little flexibility make this a very poor 4/10 for me - but I believe that other reviewers may feel much more positive with good justification. Come on Chef - be aware that not all guests can eat everything! I loved this hotel dispite the issue above and Zoe does deserve special mention for her diligence, flexibility, efficiency and abilty to turn potentially damaging situations around effectively. I will reuse this hotel if not the restaurant 'set menu' package!", "Date": "September 27, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Liverpool, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cJust as good a year on.\u201d", "Author": "natbrad", "ReviewID": "UR77879991", "Content": "Excellent once again a year on.We got a great deal which included breakfast,which we found very good and kept us going until lunch.

Make sure that you familiarise yourself with maps because it is very easy to get lost and the Biderberg Garden hotel is a little out of the way. We got lost one evening and not many local people could help us out when we asked if they knew the hotel. PPl seemed to know the apollolann street near the hotel. But it is well worth noting the surroundings and using a map!!!!! Lastly, if you want to go to the museums make sure that you go really early or later in the afternoon. I've never seen ques so long! They were so long that we didn't visit them - very dissappointing! So we ended up spending our short stay drinking (expensive) beer and eating (expensive) food - However, largely because of the state of the exchange rate.

Considering I got it for $260 US for TWO nights (about 92 Euros/night, including tax!!) I really can't complain at all. We got off on the wrong tram and had a long walk full of expletives on the way there, but when we got there realized the actual stop is only about 3-5 min. Actually, even that is slightly annoying but really not bad. Upon arrival, there were no problems, and they immediately offered us an 'executive' upgrade for 25 euros/night, which I declined (this seemed slightly sketchy somehow) They also informed us that breakfast was 22 euros, but if you booked in advance it was only 15. I was hesitant, but it seemed convenient and we booked it. A good decision as the breakfast buffet is really excellent - everything from Belgian waffles to lox. No, it's not the best, best ever, but for 15 euros, was very lovely, friendly staff, and they didn't hit you with any extras. They even have free mimosas! In terms of location, the area is suburban and very lovely, but kind of far from the central area. Now mind you Amsterdam is small and frankly you could walk still walk here from Central Station in probably 30-40 min, but it would have been nice to be closer. Plus, if you are out past midnight (which I pretty much always am) the only way home is taxi, which ends up being in the 12-14 euro area. Would have been much nicer to just walk home. However, aside from that, the place is quite nice. Lobby is lovely and modern. There is a bar and very nice and chic eating area outside. Staff doesn't seem that well trained (I agree with other reviews on this) but generally friendly and helpful - certainly not overly so, however. One reviewer said the water pressure was bad - my shower had more pressure than anywhere else in Europe that i have stayed! Might have been because I was on the first floor. Rooms are not nearly as nice as the lobby - probably on the level of a medium-sized city Holiday Inn. But clean and certainly quite decent. Bathroom was spotless and nice lotions and such. One other sketchy thing - when I checked out, they had added a 6 euro 'internet booking' fee. I'm sure this is totally outside of the hotwire agreement, but it wasn't a lot and I was simply not up to arguing about it. I might call Hotwire and see what they say.

We were very late in leaving our room on some days and the staff always had the room ready when we returned. Turn down service was prompt and efficient. The rooms were spotless. This is the type of property to book if you don't want to stay in the loud and rowdy downtown area. I honestly don't know how anyone gets any sleep in some of the properties downtown. That isn't a problem here. The proximity to the Apollolan tram stop means you can be at the museum district in 5 minutes after boarding a tram, downtown in 10 minutes. Remember that trams stop running at 12:30 at night, so budget a 20 Euro Cab Ride and you'll make it back fine. Tell the cabbie \"Apollolan Tram Stop\" and they'll get you there. Finally, if flying out early in the morning inform the front desk and they'll have a cab for you. The price is $33 euros to be taken directly to the airport - a bargain when you're in a rush. Plan to leave for the airport 2-2.5 hours before your flight. It's a 15 minute drive. As for the room decor - somewhat chic. The pillows were too soft and large for my taste, but very nice nonetheless. Also, if you want two beds you might need to rearrange the furniture as the room we stayed in had two twins that were pushed together to make a king. We moved the nightstand, seperated the beds by putting a nightstand between them, and everything worked out. I am certain the hotel would have done so if we had asked.

After completing our airfare purchase, we went on Hotwire to find a hotel. As we all know, Hotwire doesn't display the Hotel name until after you complete your purchase, so there's always that element of a crapshoot as you push the go button. Went ahead with the purchase, which was in the $150/night range. Sure enough, up came the confirmation that we were booked in the Bilderberg Garden. I immediately came to Trip Advisor to see what I had gotten myself into.

Unless you are a college student or twenty-something looking for endless partying, why would you want to stay in the middle of a busy street with thousands of tourists streaming by night and day. The Bilderberg Garden is located in one of the most posh neighborhoods on Earth. The homes along the 2 block stretch (all 8 of them) to the tram station are some of the most amazing homes I've ever seen. Talk about elegant. There are two tram stations, each about 5 minutes walk away and it's two stops to the museum district, another two or three to leidseplein, a few more to Dam Square and a few more to Centraal Station. All told you can get wherever you want to go in 20 minutes or less, with plenty of interesting things to view along the way. The Hilton hotel is across the street and there is the Best Western Delphi down the block and at least one other small boutique hotel on the same block. I honestly feel the location is one of the major plusses of this hotel. It's safe and quiet at night, easy to get to and from and quite elegant in a understated, European way. Every inch of the hotel is absolutely spotless. The rooms are beautiful and the bathrooms are all marble with high-tech European fixtures.

The local cafes are great, everyone is very friendly, and the atmosphere is much more relaxing than the centre of town. You can also walk to Vondelpark, and there are loads of posh shops if you want to spend some serious cash. The hotel does look like a concrete box from the outside, and is quite incongruous considering the architecture in the vicinity.

Our room wasn't available on arrival, so we were given a free upgrade to a suite for the night (a nice touch of luxury!). Our executive room was very typical of executive rooms everywhere - standard room size with upgrades like a spa bath, tv, internet, etc. I couldn't fault it.

This time as we were planning on staying in Holland for a week travelling from one city to another starting with 3 nights in Amsterdam. We decided the cost was important and while we needed to read up on the reviews we also need a good deal otherwise our week away would get very costly very quickly. Big mistake I would rather have paid another \u00c2\u00a375 a night than have saved money to stay here and this is why:- Very remote location in a posh suburban area. We knew it was a bit out of town but did not realise it would be a 20 \u00e2\u20ac\u201c 25 min tram ride from the centre. The hotel itself looks like a 1960\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s concrete multi storey car park from the outside but I was kind of expecting it to look a bit grim after reading reviews on here. Our first sight as we turned the corner was of a huge group on staff on a fag break \u00e2\u20ac\u201c nice! Check in took 25 mins. There was no one else in the queue the girl just kept being interrupted and tried to give us a smoking room, it then took her ages to find a non smoking room. We finally got our room card key and found our room on the first floor. It was dark, so dark you had to switch the lights on to see. I am all for a bit of green but the trees outside out window completely obscured any natural light. As we were there for 3 nights we decided to ask to change rooms. Room number two was better but the road was quite loud and the window did not shut. Not just slightly open it was open quite a way it was clearly broken and would not shut. By now 1 hr and 15 min had passed and we were a bit annoyed. We were then told there were no other non smoking rooms other than an upgrade to an Executive room BUT we could only have it for one night and then we would have to move \u00e2\u20ac\u201c again! By now we were really tired and just wanted to get on with our holiday and agreed. The Executive room was hardly executive the room was basically the same as a standard room (ours was in fact smaller than the previous two rooms); the same bath only with a jacuzzi setting and better quality bed linen! However the room was an improvement on the last two as it had replacement windows that opened and closed and it was not dark. The next morning after a very average breakfast (hair in your fruit salad anyone?) we went to the desk to ask if we could stay in our room as we really did not think it was fair to move us again! An hour later we were told after much debate that no we could not stay there and we had the choice of one of two rooms that we had to wait until after 11am to see. More wasted time of our precious holiday. We chose the room, were told our stuff would be moved and went out for our day (just before lunch!) On retuning to our new room we were gob smacked to find that the room was full of cigarette smoke and I am not joking you could see it in the air! Where was it coming from? The air conditioning unit of course! After another 45 mins we were moved to another room that luckily for us did not stink of smoke. The manager said she did not know why the room was full of smoke and would have to get it seen to as other guests were checking in shortly (luckily them!) We were offered a free drink for having to change rooms 5 times which we felt was the least they could do. You go on holiday to relax and make the most of your time and we wasted hours trying to deal with very incompetent staff to find a room that was not full of smoke, really dark and had a window that shut (surely not to much to ask from a 5 star (hilarious!) hotel. On our last morning after another delicious breakfast! we came back to our room to pack to find smoke pouring out of the air con unit! We were dumbfounded and just packed as quickly as we could and left. We were asked if we had enjoyed our stay during check out and I couldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t speak as I did not know what to stay. We love Amsterdam, we had wonderful weather, we fell in love all over again with the parks, canals, friendly people, laid back attitude and the great museums but the Bilderberg Garden was a horrific experience that will never be repeated and I would urge others to think again before booking this hotel. The hotel has had a very cheap makeover and has lots of issues that need addressing. Whoever gave this hotel 5 stars from the tourist board was having a very off day indeed! We stayed at the Radisson in Amsterdam on Rusland during our last visit which was amazing.

It is approx 20 mins to the square in all directions, we walked a different way everyday which in my opinion is the only way to see everything in Amsterdam, I could not imagine staying in the Square. Dont forget that Amsterdam is similar to London, Paris, Milan etc, if you want to spend money you certainly can, The hotel sells some very expensive food, wine and fine cigars, they also sell some very good Heineken, lovely cheap white wine and standard cigars. More importantly they dont look down or upto you regardless of what you spend or how much you tip. If you are concerned about the American ladies review about the taxi drivers, book them from the hotel, they are cheaper, especially the drive back to the airport. Just book the hotel, we cant wait to go back.

Hotel is not near anything really. I am not sure why on the map and in reviews and on the website it says it's close to the musuems. I mean its not FAR, but it's not across the street either. 2. Since trains shut off at midnight, and you're not going to walk here from the main attractions/ nightlife, you are forced to take a cab. The cabbies are actually quite scary. One of them was so sexually offensive to us (to put it incredibly mildly) that we made him pull over and got out asap, after he grabbed 20 euros out of our hands of course, and I left my bag in the cab with 500$ worth of stuff (glasses, etc.). 3. These same sketchy cabbies will drive you around Amsterdam for a while running up the meter because they are so desperate for money. In the case of the very scary situation above, we probably would've at taken the cab to the hotel IF he hadn't been driving us in the OPPOSITE DIRECTION. I mean honestly, I felt we were going to some warehouse to have our kidneys removed. It was terrifying (once again, putting it mildly). 4. The restaurant, um, sucked. I'm from Manhattan and after reading the reviews expected something exceptional. The creme brulee was disgusting. The appetizer of venicen and cod was dilicious. the entree of sea bass was bland. For 40 euro, go someplace else, like THE GARAGE or BARK, both of which were booked all night when we tried to walk in off the street. These places are right near the hotel and open till midnight. The hotel told us everyplace closes at 10 except Bark. They should've told us about the GARAGE also (both places were really bustling and fancy) and made us a reservation or something but they didn't. Oh well. 5. The exterior or the hotel will not impress you. DO NOT expect a five star experience. Like the review below, maybe 3 stars. Overall, if you're a tourist, stay someplase else.

The first night, the room was really hot and we couldn't get the air conditioning to work properly, but we mentioned it to the receptionist the next morning and when we returned in the evening it had been fixed.

Many of the guests were obviously business people but we did not feel out of place, and the receptionist gave us a very helpful map and showed us the best places to go. In fact, that free map was more useful than many of the maps in the guide books as it contained tram routes, canal bus routes and shopping areas all on one page. It was a five minute walk to the tram stop and there were 8 trams an hour into the city centre - about a 15 min journey. We bought a three day tram ticket from the hotel and it was hassle-free after that.

As a Dutch-tourism-rated 5 star hotel, we expected a lot, but were told later that the Dutch star ratings are based on price more than services and amenities. It is a nice hotel, but if you are expecting a \"5-star experience\", look elsewhere--it is not posh by any means and is probably a 3 star in all honesty. Additionally, we found the distance a little too far from the city center for our liking. The hotel is nice-enough, but does not really shine in any area nor does it endear itself to its guests. As we were driven to the front door, we were taken aback by the construction along the entire front of the hotel--it did not look inviting. (Hopefully, the construction will be finished for future guests as it was neither attractive nor especially quiet. However, upon entering we found a Dutch-modern design, with inviting fresh flower arrangements throughout. Beyond the reception is a lobby bar with a cozy fireplace. We were fortunate enough to observe the pre-Christmas flowers arrangements and the Christmas themed arrangements: mid-stay, the numerous white rose arrangements were changed to red roses, and beautiful greenery and Christmas trees were on display. Our room, as the hotel, was Dutch-modern by design: stark, with lots of dark-wood paneling and simple dark wood built-ins and small leather furniture. The bedding was sleek, but the sheets were rough to the touch. Additionally, there was a problem with the TV, as it tended to turn off or become unusable at times, and the luggage holder collapsed upon first use. There are thoughtful touches, such as shoe-shine machines on each floor, in-room coffee service with a choice of coffees and teas, and a specific style of glass/mug for each of the beers/spirits in the mini-bar. But there are negatives, such as the below-average shower and water pressure (heat equalization), no shower curtain, and smallish bathroom. The service was polite, but neither polished nor especially helpful. The hotel is located in a quiet and rather upscale residential area, but the lack of lighting on the surrounding sidewalks at night may pose a problem for some. Finally, this hotel is not convenient to any tourist areas and we noticed that it was heavily tilted towards a business clientele. The tram stop is only about a 5 minute walk away, but the additional 5 minute tram ride to the museum quarter or the 10 minute ride to the Dam area was not especially convenient and made it hard to \"pop-in\" to the hotel to freshen-up during the day, especially in the rain common to the region this time of year. (The hotel was represented to be \"convenient\" to the city center, which we definitely did not agree).
