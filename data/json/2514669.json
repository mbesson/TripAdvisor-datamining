When we'd walk out the front entry and look right (West), you could see the entrance to Rockerfeller Center only several hundred yards away. Just past that was the iconic Radio City Music Hall sign. Directly across the street from the hotel was Bill's (GREAT burgers and of course beers). We walked to Broadway, Central Park and Times Square. We only took the transportation to a ballgame in NJ, to see the 9/11 Memorial and the Upper West Side. ROOM: It was very clean and spacious (for a NYC room). Had a very vintage, old NY feel to it (by this I don't mean it was nasty and run down...it was very well kept). If you want to stay the entire trip in the room, I'd say go somewhere else and pay 2-3 times as much. But this is perfect for the average traveler. STAFF: The entire staff was friendly, helpful and more than willing to point my wife and I to a great restaurant. OVERALL: I will not stay anywhere else from now on when I visit NYC. I was timid at first because of the price (roughly $220/nt compared to $400+/nt at other hotels in the area), but this place is where it's at.", "Date": "March 27, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "KELOWNA BC", "Title": "\u201cGREAT LOCATION & VALUE\u201d", "Author": "SCOUSERKelownaBc", "ReviewID": "UR124173444", "Content": "Recommended to us by friends and we were not disappointed.

We only had two nights in New York and as it was our first visit, it was important to us that we were near to the main places. The hotel is just round the corner from the Rockafella centre and from here you can take the hop on hop off buses. We went to see Cirque du Soleil at the Radio City Hall which is 3 minutes walk from the hotel. Taxis run past the hotel all the time so are easy to catch if you need one. As for the hotel itself,our first impressions were good. The staff were very helpful and efficient. West Club is an old building which I personally found enchanting. Our room was spacious, clean and comfortable. However I do agree with the previous review that the air conditioning is old and noisy. It didn't bother me as it drowned out any traffic noise.however this could be a problem for light sleepers. There is a lovely restaurant ,ballroom and jazz nights were held every Wednesday when we were there. to sum it up,this was a great value small hotel in a superb location. Would I stay there again?

When I opened the door of our room, it smelled so musty and moldy, we had to run the air conditioner for hours to make it tolerable. The clock was broken, we couldn't figure out how to work the tv, and the phone had no labeling to tell you which # to call for a particular service. For us, having a nice room is an important part of our stay anywhere. This is especially true for us in NYC, as we are both 'expats' and don't need to visit Rockefeller Center, etc. The meeting rooms are lovely and I wouldn't mind holding an event there, but that's not why we were there.

Kudos to Maria Cristina, our waitress, she is some of the best advertising any hotel could ever ask for. This hotel also doubles as the national Women's republican club, so lots of great public rooms and good meeting space as well. I was booked at the Jewel but ended up at 3West.

We had the king suite and it was massive. There is a king size bed, a double pull-out (that was fairly comfortable) and they brought up a roll away for our oldest (our little one shared the king with my hubby and I). So romance it was not, but for our group it was perfect. There were three closets - one in the bathroom, one in the hall and then one in a dressing area off the hall. The staff was always helpful and friendly. It was also very clean. This is not your typical chain hotel though.

I used this hotel as a backup while I was trying to get a cheaper hotel on priceline. As luck would have it, there was no inventory mid-week on priceline for our dates, so we ended up staying here. For some reason, prices for that week appeared higher than usual for NYC. As a result, the 3 West Club was one of the better bargains I could get at $214 per night ($247 w/tax) without a long list of negative reviews and scary stories. We were, however, a little hesitant because there were so few reviews, and we could find no other information about the hotel, even on their website. But, we decided to take a chance. Our flight to NYC was very delayed, so I called the hotel and told them we would be very late. They said not to worry, that they would never give a hotel room away when we had a reservation. We ended up arriving at about 3 AM, and they had a room waiting for us. We had a room overlooking W 51st Street on the seventh floor. If you are a light sleeper, the noise from the street could be a problem. We were so tired each night that it really didn't bother us too much, and I am a light sleeper. Overall, we were pleasantly surprised with the room at that price. If you are looking for luxury, services and amenities in a hotel, I don't think this is the place for you. However, if you need a decent, clean room in an excellent location, this is it. The room was not too small, had a good-sized closet, a decent shower, and a flat panel LCD TV with digital cable and tons of channels. At the time we were there, there was scaffolding on the front of the building, but that really didn't bother us - we didn't notice any active work (i.e., noise from construction) going on while we were there. Through the scaffolding, we could see Rockefeller Center across the street and St. Patrick's Cathedral on the corner. The excellent location of this hotel can't be overstated if you are there to visit many of the tourist attractions.
