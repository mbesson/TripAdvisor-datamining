The rooms are very clean and modern and the staff is friendly and helpful. This hotel doesn't have any fancy amenities, no pool, no downstairs bar, but no fuss! Room Service is available from the neighboring International House. The French Quarter/Bourbon is an easy walking distance and the only noise you will hear at night are few and far between people walking on the street below. They also lock the doors at night with room key only front door access so it's very private. My boyfriend and I stayed here two nights for the Crescent City Classic.

Simply put, for the price you won't find a better stay in all of NOLA... end of story. Visit their site and study the pics featuring clean lines, 21st century hipster sense of interior decorating, giant tubs, unfinished concrete floors, high ceilings and most importantly --elbow room!-- this is EXACTLY what you get folks. It's a hotel room that manages to feel like home the minute you walk in the door. Imminently stylish yet utterly simple and cozy. My girlfriend and I stayed there for three nights in January 2012 and enjoyed every minute...I knew the minute I put the key in the door, that I'd picked the right place for our NOLA adventure-- that's the best feeling in the world when you've just exited a plane and traveled a thousand miles to get there. There's absolutely no question where we are staying the next time we visit New Orleans. A week prior to our arrival, I had reservations at another well-known hotel in the French Quarter. On a whim I called the Loft 523 desk and spoke with Justin about accommodations and things to do in the city. What I received was an utterly authentic, patient and warm breakdown of the unique Loft 523 accommodations as well as local restaurant, music and art recommendations. I canceled my other reservations and booked with the Loft right on the spot. Later in the week, prior to our arrival I had the opportunity to speak with Stephanie and Justin at length about excursions and dining specifics-- they were both incredibly knowledgeable and generous with their time and sharing their personal experiences. Since I hadn't been in the French Quarter in over 25 years, I can't overstate how helpful and welcoming this was. Because of Stephanie and Justin, my girlfriend and I got to experience some much needed R&R, dining at amazing places like Bayona and Muriel's as well as going to some wonderful historic sites. Justin recommended an out-of-the way music venue (the Marigny Opera House) to me on our first night there-- it was probably the highlight of our trip and one of the most romantic, haunting and uniquely New Orleans experiences we had!

We had a room on the second floor above the club and we could feel the vibrations! This along with everyone talking\\shouting outside certainly kept us awake. The rooms are only single glazed so it was like all the people outside were in our room with us! The club is only open 3 nights a week, so if you are not staying on these nights you would be ok. The maintenance...overall the rooms are nice but there was a few minor points. The ventilation in the bathroom did not appear to work...in fact it was just a hole in the plasterboard ceiling where I assume a grate of some kind should have been. There was another small hole in the wall where I assume a towel hook once was. The shower also had mould in it, which is not expected at this price range.

The first is it's location. Only two blocks from the French Quarter, the location couldn't have been more perfect for us. We were close to the action, but not in the thick of it, which is exactly what we wanted. We were also within walking distance of some great restaurants, including Herbsaint on St. Charles, which I highly recommend, and we were able to walk from the Garden District back to the hotel one afternoon. Again, the location was a big plus for us. The second is the size and look of the rooms. We had the deluxe room, which had huge windows and a high ceiling, concrete floors and a really nice, lofty feeling that we loved. Our bed was super comfy and the music system was very cool (bring an IPOD, if you have one). And our shower, with dual shower heads, was massive. The third aspect, which is always a big plus, was cleanliness. Our room was spotless and housekeeping did a great job everyday. The downside - and for me this is a big one - was noise. Like many other reviewers noted, there is a club on the ground floor of the hotel, right off the lobby that's open several days a week, including weekends. Our room was on the fourth floor, but we could still hear the music and feel the thump of the bass into the wee hours of the morning. We could also hear noise from those who had stepped outside to smoke. Luckily, I had read reviews that mentioned the noise issue before heading to NOLA, so I brought ear plugs with me; and I'm glad I did. I used them two out of the three nights we were there. But, honestly, who wants to put in ear plugs when you're paying $130+ a night for a room? It was manageable, but certainly not ideal.

So when I found a great deal on the stylish-looking Loft 523, I was pretty excited for a change of pace from the usual type of hotel I stay in (the kind where you try to spend as little time as possible in the room). My hubby and I loved New Orleans and we loved this hotel. It was located within walking distance from the bus stop (we took the public bus from the airport). We were able to check in at about 10:30am after our red-eye flight from CA. We immediately loved the concrete floors and modern furniture. Later that night, about 1am, after returning from partying in the French Quarter, we discovered why they call it the \"We Will Rock You\" room - the noisy bar below was indeed noisy. But guess what? When we discovered the I-pod dock next to the flat-screen TV, we suddenly didn't care anymore. The speakers ROCKED, i think there was even a subwoofer! We played our tunes over the noise of the bar and had a blast. We were so sad to check out. This place even SMELLED good. I could live there! The staff was very polite and helpful. Our only slightly negative experience was the second night when we visited the attached bar, LePhare, to use the credit they gave us (I am guessing they give the \"We Will Rock You\" guests bar credit so they don't complain about the noise from the bar below). The manager kept making us move (3 times) so he could accomodate other parties. We asked how many times we would be asked to move and he gave us some attitude. But whatever, free drinks, so how can I complain (although I'm sure that's what he was thinking too). Go, enjoy, soak it up!

When I brought it up to the customer service manager Amiee Foret was extremely insulting with the way she handled the situation. To share with you the details of what occurred with my stay the shower in 2D apparently had a defect in it which caused the water to leak from the bathroom to the sleeping quarters in a short period of time. I ran the shower for less than four minutes so that the water could get hot and noticed that the water was leaking from the shower area to the sleeping quarters. At that point I placed towels throughout the floor to soak up the water. Unfortunately, I had my tan leather computer bag to the right of the bed where it was damaged. I immediately called the front desk and the overnight front desk receptionist was clueless on what to do. She attempted to call maintenance but they were not available at 11:30 p.m. so I suggested if she could provide me with another room. At that point she checked me into the room across the hall which was 2E. I was extremely surprised that no one offered to assist me with moving my belongings from 2D to 2E. On Friday morning as I was checking out I voiced my complaint to the front desk hostess and she immediately called Amiee Foret. Amiee was very nonchalant, I informed Amiee that I have pictures to show the damage that was caused to the room and I can show her the damage that was done to my bag and I asked her if she can come to loft 523 and I can show her what took place. Her statement was to me was why would I let the shower run for 4 minutes? I explained to her that I was waiting for the water to get hot and I didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t realize the water was leaking into the bedroom while I was shaving. Her statement was to me that that really doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t make any sense but she will have maintenance come and check it out. Once we disconnected from the phone call I spoke with the front desk associate, showed her the pictures and she advised me since Amiee refused to come to Loft 523 that I should walk to the International House where she is located and show her the pictures, so that is what I did. It took Aimee over 20 minutes to come out once I asked for her at the front desk, and when she arrived she was extremely rude and very reluctantly looked at the pictures that were taken on my phone. At this point she stated to me that maintenance was in the room and they did not see a problem, which made me extremely upset because she indirectly was calling me a liar. I asked if I could meet maintenance in the room because I was truly upset with this statement and I refused to be called a liar. At this point I walked with the head of maintenance and when I arrived to Loft 523 the maintenance associate checked the wrong room, he checked 2E instead of 2D. At this point I was extremely upset but myself and the maintenance associate walked into 2D turned the shower on and within 2 minutes the bathroom started flooding and it leaked into the bedroom. Maintenance then contacted Aimee and asked her to take care of this situation for me and advised me to walk back to the International House to resolve this matter. When I went back into the International House it took Aimee over 15 minutes to come and speak with me. Once she arrived Aimee stated that she will reduce the room rate by half. I explained to Aimee at this point reducing the room rate by half is completely unacceptable. Her statement to me was that she does not understand why this is unacceptable. I explained to Aimee that she has held me up for over an hour and a half to prove my case in addition I had to move into another room in the middle of the night and my bag was damaged not to mention she indirectly called me a liar. At this point she reluctantly informed me that there would be no charge for my stay.

We were supposed to stay there for Saturday night as well, but you'll soon find out why we bailed. We booked this hotel after reading all of the positive reviews on TripAdvisor. I pre-paid on neworleansonline.com because I received a better rate than booking straight through the hotel. I had paid for a superior room, but when we checked in, we were pleasantly surprised to get a deluxe superior room with the stone tub. The only caveat was that we were put on the 2nd floor. When I had called a week earlier to confirm my reservation, I was told that we'd be on the third floor. The reception guy told me that they were all booked and could only accomadate me on the 2nd floor, and assured me that the room is away from the club on the 2nd floor and should not hear \"a thing\". If you're on the 2nd floor (anywhere on the 2nd floor), then you're pretty much screwed because of the club downstairs. I mean, you can pretty much sing along to all the songs because you can practically hear EVERYTHING that is happening downstairs. As we were trying to sleep, we could hear/feel the bass through the pillows. The whole room was vibrating with bass. It wasn't so bad on Thursday night, but on Friday, it was ridiculous. Who thought that it'd be a good idea to build a loft hotel on top of a club?!? On Saturday morning, we went down to reception to ask for a room change, something above the second floor. We had to wake up really early for a 6am flight on Sunday morning, so a good night's rest was much needed. Reception told us that they were fully booked and were unable to honor our request for a room change. However, they did offer to discount our rate, which would have been great had we not pre-paid through neworleansonline.com. They did say that a standard room at their sister hotel, The International House, was available to us should we decide to move. Yes, of course, we wanted to move! We didn't want to listen to the \"I Love Big Butts....\" song AGAIN!! The International House Hotel is just a block away, so it wasn't that big of an inconvenience to schlep our stuff around.

As others have noted, the bathrooms were amazing. The tubs (pictured) really are extraordinary. We recommend that you don't take a bath if you are truly interested in NOT being converted to the merits of a ridiculously expensive tub. We've both had apartments that were smaller than the bathroom in our room. Did anyone mention the memory foam mattresses? That was some good sleepin'. We were on the 4th floor on the backside of the hotel. We heard zero noise even though we were there on \"Russian Night\" at the club. It is, likely, a good thing that we were not subject to bad Euro-techno at all hours.

I was disappointed, however, to get a room on the 2nd floor b/c I was concerned, from reading trip advisor, about the noise from the bar. There was no flexibility b/c I needed a room with a tub, since my partner who would be joining me for the weekend, had foot surgery and could not get her foot wet.

I have to say now, most of the reviews are right on. The good: The rooms were generally good. Super comfy beds and well appointed furniture. We started off in a larger Superior room, but moved to a smaller room for a larger window and balcony. DON'T spend the extra money on the larger room, the standard size room is more than enough, and the bathroom was actually a little better. More Good: We were in NOLA for new year's, the same time as the Sugar Bowl. This hotel was extremely quiet and a nice break from all the craziness outside. The front desk staff were all helpful and really nice. There's also free internet access. The Bad: Just like others have said, service isn't so great. The staff is shared with the I Hotel, so there is no staff in the hotel except the front desk person. The housekeeping was subpar. An empty bottle of water was never removed from the nightstand for our whole stay (I know it's obnoxious but I left it just to see). All housekeeping did was make the bed and change the towels. Coffee and creamer weren't replaced, things weren't straightened up. More Bad: Like another reviewer, we had problems with our toilet which wasn't fixed. I actually had to go into the lobby to use the bathroom in the morning! There were also issues with our billing, and my husband ended up getting charged about 4 times. Overall: I would stay here again if my options were limited, but I'd be sure to ask for a room facing the front of the hotel with a balcony or large window.

To give the pluses, the room itself was incredible and the staff, although somewhat limited, was fairly friendly. Unfortunately, the charm ends there. The website gives the impression that it is connected to the Ihotel, but except for the staff, we saw no evidence of it. For ex\\ample, we called the front desk on our first morning to order some coffee and breakfast. We were informed that they did not have room service. Needless to say, we were disappointed. The Loft bills itself as a cool and luxurious property. But they did not even offer a continental breakast that are offered at limited service hotels. Parking: The hotel charges $30.00 per night for valet parking, which is almost three times the amount charged by other hotels in the area. To make matters worse, they contract their valet service. When we called for our car on Saturday afternoon, we had to wait over 20 minutes for it to be brought to the hotel. Room Deficiencies: Our room came with a DVD player; however, there were no cables to connect the player to the television. When we talked to the front desk about it on Friday night, they assured us that we would have cables by the following day. Instead, they removed the player and did not provide a replacement. Also, the water temperature in the shower was tepid, and we could not adjust the position of the nozzles. Housekeeping: We left our room on Saturday morning at 10:00 in the morning, and retuned at 3:00. The room was not made. We wanted to rest before dinner, and asked the front desk to have housekeeping clean at 6:00. A few minutes later, the housekeeper called us on the phone and said that they had no housekeeping service after 6:00. Thus, we had o leave the room for 30 minutes while they serviced the room. NOISE: The hotel has a bar on the first floor. Despite the fact that the hotel was not near capacity, we were placed in a room just above the bar on the second floor. On both nights, we were kept awake by noise coming from revelers who were standing outside of the hotel after the bar closed. On both nights, we called the front desk to ask them to quiet the crowd. On both nights, we were told that there was nothing they could do about the situation. We considered writing a letter to the owners/managers of the hotel.

We loved the high ceilings. We loved the furniture and decorations in the room. We loved that the maid left music playing after she was finished. We loved the bar. Very sleek and nice and on Friday nights it was jumpin'. We loved most of all, the spoon tub. If you stay here do yourself a favor and just upgrade for the experience of the tub. Cons: The walls were a bit thin and you could hear people down the halls. At night there was a very strange swishing sound. I have no idea what it was, but I had a hard time falling asleep sometimes because of it. Lastly, Magazine street in between Gravier and Canal has too many street people that would stop and try to swindle you for money. It is best to take Camp Street up to Canal to get to the French Quarter. Restaurants: Pat O's always a favorite same as Cafe Maspero and Pierre Maspero's. Sweet Ginger (thai) was excellent. The coconut shrimp is supreme. The Bourbon House was excellent as well. We also enjoyed Johnny's Poboys (all though we saw roaches on three different occasions, yuck!)

It is more New York minimal chic than New Orleans charm, but it turned out ot be a nice respite away from the rowdiness of Bourbon Street. Upon our early arrival we were greeted by a very friendly front desk clerk who gave us a great recommendation for lunch while our room was being made up. When we returned, we were surprised with a complimentary upgrade to one of the penthouse units and a bottle of Champagne on ice (I reserved the room on their website, and mentioned that we were there to celebrate our anniversary, so they obviously took note!). Our room was beatifully designed with very contemporary furniture in a calming palette of neutral colors and textures. The attached photos show the great \"spoon\" tub (for two!) and spacious open bathroom, as well as the generous sleeping and lounge areas of the main room. There was a long and narrow rooftop deck for our exclusive use, but the humidity, heat, and lack of view made it a \"nice to have\" ammenity that was seldom used. Loft 523 is a top notch boutique hotel that provides great value at reasonable rates -- but there are a few things that irked us enough to withold a 5-star endorsement. First, the ultramodern plumbing fixtures look better than they work. Water pressure was low, at best, and tended to alternate between surge and sputter at all times. There was no water for the first hour on our first morning, which might have been a municipal issue, but the real annoyance came on the second morning: on a day that we just wanted to sleep in, we were disturbed from our sleep by banging/ knocking pipes in the corridor walls. I called the front desk and received an unaplogetic acknowledgement of the issue which took over an hour to be fixed. All in all, Loft 523 is a great hotel, but there are just some minor details that they need to be more attentive to. With only 18 rooms in the entire building, they should be able to offer a higher level service. Buy even with the minor shortcomings, I would happily refer other people to this hotel. The great location, super comfortable beds, great privacy, and well designed rooms make Loft 523 one of the more unique hotel destinations in all of New Orleans.", "Date": "May 29, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Service": "2", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "New York", "Title": "\u201cRelies too much on the cool room decor\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR3316516", "Content": "I give Loft 523 four stars only because the rooms are undeniably cool. The high, high ceilings and spaciousness of the rooms make up for a lot if you are a self-reliant sort of traveler. The king-sized bed was extremely comfortable, with a great chenille blanket on top for extra warmth. I have not slept so well in a while. The tub was extraordinary; don't miss taking a bath if you stay here. It takes a long time to fill up, and in our room at least the hot water took quite a while to get hot, but it's a great hedconistic experience. The bathroom, overall, is quite nice and very large. The towels are rough, though. Throughout the room, the lights are all on dimmers, so you can set the level that fits your mood. Keeping the temperature in the room steady was a challenge, but that's New Orleans. There's a lot of variable humidity. The climate controls were very responsive, and there was a big ceiling fan in our room with adjustable speeds which helped cool the room off in a hurry. The chaise and chair provided were uncomfortable. The television swings around so you can watch from bed or the other side of the room, but the other furniture was so stiff and unyielding that we watched from bed most often. The floors are concrete, which is surprisingly cool and comfortable on the feet. As far as noise, we were right over the bar and facing the street and were not disturbed at all. However, the bar was closed the first two of the three nights we were there, and we live in Manhattan, so we're used to street noise. I must say, I was tensed up about the third night having read all the reviews that mentioned the noise from the bar, but there simply wasn't any. I didn't have to use the earplugs I brought in anticipation. As stated before, there are no facilities in the hotel at all. If you want to order breakfast you have to put your order in at least two hours in advance. Dinner room service is brought in from the restaurant in International House around the corner, the sister property to Loft 523. We did not order any room service at all, nor did we drink the coffee in the room (take the walk to Cafe du Monde instead; it's worth it). There is also very little information in the room itself. There is the ubiquitous folio in the room, but when you open it, expecting to see information about the area, the hotel, etc., there is very little. What is there is an unfortunately long paean to the design of the hotel, etc. We also found it difficult to get information and assistance from hotel staff. Although no one was rude or unprofessional, it seemed like there was a \"bare minimum\" aspect to the service. If you are the kind of person who doesn't need pampering and can ask for exactly what you need, you will be fine. Do your research before you go. I think this hotel needs to step it up a notch. The level of personal attention and service needs to match the excellence of the room design. It's a smashing concept for a hotel, but everything else falls slightly short of expectations. I'd be curious whether the International House has the same minimalistic approach to customer service. I still recommend Loft 523. It is in a good location, within a short walk from the French Quarter and the Aquarium. There is a mission around the corner, so some impoverished-looking people are often hanging around on that street.

Granted if you don't like that type of music in the club, a light sleeper, or go to bed early in New Orleans, you are not likely to enjoy it due to the pounding beats vibrating through the building (we were on the fourth floor and heard sounded like we were just one floor above it). We thought the rooms had the right touch and we felt that it was very private in every manner there.

Stayed for a four day weekend. While the chic minimalist decor was cool (entire hotel is no more than 20 rooms), this small hotel is really a nightclub in disguise. In the lobby bar, the hotel operates a nightclub with live DJs every Friday and Saturday night--music until 3am. When we called at 1am on Friday night to complain about the Hip Hop party (loud music and pounding beat that shakes the entire hotel) we were told that there was nothing they would do about it and they refused to stop the music. They said that the Hip Hop party is a regular feature of the hotel. If you are unlucky enough to have a room facing the street (about half of the rooms) you were forced to listen to the noise from the crowd gathered downstairs at the velvet ropes. The crowd noise was almost as noisy as the music. We were unable to call downstairs to complain because the only front desk attendant left his post to hang out at the bar--there was no one at the front desk for half an hour--providing no hotel security whatsoever. When I arrived in the lobby to search for the front desk attendent at 2am there were two other guests waiting as well. The hotel management was completely unapologetic and said that the bar is an important part of the business--a rather crazy answer for a hotel. Preparing to go out to dinner the following night (Saturday at 7), we noticed that go-go dancers were arriving with DJ for another party. When we inquired, we were then told that in addition to the Friday night hip hop party, there was a 70s party every Saturday night. Somehow the hotel management forgot to tell us this when we experienced problems with the hip hop party the prior night. The manager then rudely told us that we could switch hotels to a hotel near the airport because the entire city was booked an there was nothing else at any hotel including the hotel they owned--International House. Throughout the entire weekend management was rude and unaccomodating and lied about the situation. We inquired what we were not informed of the nightclub situation when booking the rooms, the manager finally admitted that the nightclub noise has been a problem and that they might tell guests upfront in the future. We subsequently learned that the nightclub also hosts various parties on other nights as well. There are so many decent hotels in this city--why would you choose one that values it's nightclub business over its hotel guests and makes no attempt to accomodate at all. Just off the top of my head I would recommend these hotels that I have stayed at: W, Omni Royal Orleans, St. James, Omni Royal Crescent, Fairmont, Ritz-Carlton.", "Date": "January 11, 2004"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "2.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cLike dating a supermodel...\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR1545674", "Content": "Yes, this is a beautiful hotel, but aside from that there is nothing.

Loft 523 is a very unique property. Just look at it s website and you ll see a hotel unlike any other. That s their draw. That s why I stayed with them. However I wish someone had cautioned me about the following:As mentioned in a previous post, the bar/dance club can get quite loud (and it's not jazz). The second floor would be tough for all but the deepest of sleepers. Even on the fourth floor, I was hard pressed to get to sleep before 2am due to a combination of music, shouting and car horns. I heard partying continue on the street until past 4am! Cars would cruise on by and compete with the DJ on who had the loudest system. I was even able to hear a woman s footsteps from four floors up very poor soundproofing. Try to get a room in the back if you don t plan on partying the night away.WARNING: beware of their valet parking. It is outsourced and the service robbed me blind. On top of the $26 per night cost, the parking attendants will go through your vehicle and steal anything of value. They took all the change from the center console (including a couple bills hidden for an emergency), a couple CD s, a knife I m still trying to assess all that they stole. Make sure you clean out your vehicle or they will. And for you International Hotel visitors they utilize the same valet parking company....", "Date": "December 28, 2003"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "5.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "uk", "Title": "\u201cFor the hard to please!\u201d", "Author": "redarmy", "ReviewID": "UR1377922", "Content": "I truly enjoyed my three week stay at Loft 523 in \"The Big Easy.\" There is a great sense of privacy at Loft 523.
