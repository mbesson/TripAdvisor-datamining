The hotel was very clean and pleasant, and the staff were always helpful especially Elburto on reception who was there on our arrival and helped us out with a map and good directions to town. We found the Hotels location to be ideal for us and we walked most of the time into Central Rome and used the Hotel shuttle service a couple of times, the driver was a very pleasant man. Breakfast was enjoyable however the coffee from the machine was not too good so we asked for one at the bar and they were happy to oblige. The pool was not available for use due to being out of season and we had to pay extra for the sauna. The roof terrace was a lovely space to take a bottle of wine and olives (not from the bar only peanuts available) and was underused by the rest of the residents.

Got a very good deal on the hotel through Expedia. And at that price, I cannot complaint. Its not the best location in town - but it has decent transport links. The metro is literally around the corner. The bus stop for the 990 is 2 minutes away. The bus runs every 10-15 minutes right up to midnight and starts and ends at Piazza Cavour (a fifteen minute ride) which is a convenient 5-15 minute walk from most of the tourist traps. Tickets cost 1 euro each way (or four euros for the day) and must be bought before boarding (from the tabacchi just under the metro station). The \"free shuttle\" is a bus capable of carrying 8 persons. The hotel building and rooms are well maintained and clean. The rooms are starting to look a little dated, but not yet scruffy. Surprisingly, there was no airconditioning in the rooms. When we asked about this, we were told that the weather is good enough to just open out the windows! The rooms are BIG by european standards - and fitted in two single and two kiddie beds. Breakfast is an uninspired affair with concentrated juice, powdery coffee, scrambled eggs that taste like sponge, bacon swimming in some liquid. The restaurant does get better for the other meals with quite a decent menu. (We dined there thrice. The first and last times were fine, but on Easter night the hotel was understaffed and the staff was over-worked. The meal took the better part of 45 minutes to turn up and there was a noticeable drop in its quality) There is a terrace lounge which is quite neatly done, but wasn't operating a service this time of the year. This is one of those places where nothing is perfect, and yet, not wrong enough to whine about. With a little better service, comfier rooms (with a working aircon) and a vastly improved brekky, it would deserve the fourth star that it claims.", "Date": "April 13, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Glasgow, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cGreat service, clean,quiet\u201d", "Author": "pablos19", "ReviewID": "UR127701355", "Content": "Stayed here with my wife & two children, the only negative that we have is we would have preferred pure fruit juice in the mornings, rather than concentrated with our breakfast, but otherwise we had an excellent weeks stay.

We found a deal for 4 nights in the Tiberio, without knowing much more. When we arrived we saw a very nice hotel (compared to others in Rome, from what we looked at) - but at a place that seemed far from the city center. It was, indeed, a bit far, but after eating Pizza & Pasta there's nothing better to do than a walk back. The hotel seemed clean and comfortable, and the room was nice as well with a big window and a comfortable bed. The main attraction, for us, was Umberto, the night clerk at the desk, that was very nice, helpful, and charming. The minute he found out it was our honeymoon he sent us a big bottle of wine to the room, on the house. The following day (Seeing as we didn't want to drink) we decided to send the bottle back. When he heard about it, he said that he'd find something to suit us. He sent us a charming fruit & candy basket, and we simply fell in love. All in all our stay was very nice, we can definitely recommend it. Downside - location, but although it's a bit far from the city center, it's pretty close to the Vatican, and well worth the quick drive. Make sure to know your way back though, because it is somewhat in a back street (we enjoyed the walk but got pretty tired on the way back, luckily we had a map).

The ones I must particularly refute are as follows: 1.The hotel is within walking distance of the city centre but is located in a quiet suburb - I was travelling with my mother (who won't mind me saying, is no spring chicken) and we found the stroll easy. 2. There is graffiti on buildings surrounding the hotel but that is true of everywhere in Rome except the Vatican walls! It is ridiculous to take graffiti as some sort of indication of the comparitive safety of the area. We walked about the area at all times of the day and night and felt perfectly safe. 3. The free shuttle to either the Vatican or downtown is a real boon and is always prompt. 4.The breakfast buffet is the usual continental style and although nothing to write home about, there is a decent selection and plenty of it. 5. All the staff are helpful and will try their best to help you with any queries or problems. 6. There are some very nice places to eat near the hotel - particularly if you are wanting to eat where the locals do and get an authentic experience. I would especially recommend La Sagra del Vino on Via Marziale. The owner is wonderfully friendly and is equally happy to either let you choose for yourself or make recommendations. Finally, please go to this hotel in the confident knowledge that there is nothing to worry about. I appreciate that some people have unrealistic expectations and that this can colour their view of an entire stay and that some people are very easily pleased - I am neither, praise where it is due only. PS If you suffer from a non visible disability such as deafness it is vital that you take proof of your disability with you to places such as the Vatican and Colloseum as it entitles you to non-queing free entry for you and your carer.

The room was very clean and had a beautiful veranda that would have been great in the summertime. Let's face it folks, you CANNOT EXPECT AN AMERICAN BREAKFAST OUTSIDE OF THE UNITED STATES! I had no complaints about the breakfast, and frankly thought it was better than some of the complimentary buffets you find in the US hotels. I mean, do you seriously book based on quality of bacon and eggs?! RIDICULOUS! Most Italians don't even EAT bacon and eggs for breakfast so why the heck would they know how to make them?! We ate dinner at the restaurant in the hotel several nights and the food was good and appropriately priced. We didn't run into any trouble with the shuttle, in fact, the drivers were very good and enjoyed practicing english with us. I think the sign up is a great idea because you don't have to wait around in lines. As long as you plan out your trip and sign up for shuttles appropriately, you should have NO PROBLEM. We even walked all the way from the hotel to the OTHERSIDE of Rome, by the Colesseum, and back. It's not a terrible walk, and you should probably be doing it from all the gelato and pasta you eat there anyways. Never once did I feel unsafe walking in the neighborhood. I thought it was nice for a city neighborhood. I mean, it's not a gated community (though it does have a gate) but it certainly a FAR cry from HOOD. I think it is important to note that Italians are NOT going to go out of their way to cater to you. Many people confuse this culture with being rude, it's not that they're rude, they are just matter of fact and direct. Don't expect to be groveled upon, they do what theyre supposed to, they aren't going to care about your life story, sorry...Also, don't try to butcher their beautiful language, but don't expect EVERYONE to speak english.

Ok some hotels are not up to expectancy for some people but this hotel is fabulous. We have not been away for six years and my husband booked this for our 5th Wedding/honeymoon as a suprise for me, so this was very special to us. After he told me i thought i would do some research and read some of the reviews and after I had i was in tears as some of them were absolutely awefull ie, rude staff,terrible food,disgusting rooms and worst of all BED BUGS!!!. Obviously with all of this I straight away emailed the hotel Manager Mr Angelo Celentano who asked me to read the overall reviews and not just the bad ones and assured us out stay would be perfect. Mr Celentano you and your hotel and staff made our holiday, a lovely gesture of champayne for our anniversary was unexpected but so kind, the rooms were spotlessly clean and airey, the conditioning was on all night (much needed as it reached 99 degrees) and oyur staff were very helpfull and polite and funny. Breakfast was well, 5 star and plenty of it. We were spoilt by the size of the bed, it was huge and not one sign of anything sharing it with us,lol.Oh and go up to the roof top terrace, amazing veiws and so relaxing after a days walking and hot sun. The area surounding the hotel was very quiet and you could walk to the Metro in 10 mins and everything is in walking distance if you wish to do so. fill up your water bottles for free at the various water fountaind dotted around, water is safe to drink and is ice cold which was a much welcome relieve. We found it cheaper to walk around on our own and nor with a guide and saved us lots of money wich you will get through like water. If you go to ST Peters DO get there about 7/7.30 am we did and had it to ourselves barr from about 70 people for an hour or so and were first up to the viewing point in the dome, be warned though the view is breath taking but its 750 steps to climb, worth paying an extra 2 Euros to pass the first 200 steps.Taxis, if you book a taxi to the hotel you will be charged straight off from where it had come from so it could work out very expensive, its cheaper to get the Metro and pay 4 euros foran all day metro/bus ticket or 1 euro to where you want to go on the metro. All in all a very special and beautifull holiday thanks to my wonderfull husband for organising it and Grand Hotel Tiberio. Final word, DO NOT be put off by the bad reviews, Ok, hotels cannot make everyone happy and I have stayed in a few I have not liked in the past but Grand Hotel Tiberio is one of the good ones, so go with confidence and enjoy every bit of your stay.

The main problem with me was the location. It's in a neighborhood of apartment buildings, more than a mile west of Vatican City.

I never tried the bus, since I didn't want to wait at a bus stop for awhile, and also I wasn't sure how to properly buy the bus tickets at a tobacco shop, etc. I'm sure it's simple, but I preferred walking. Still, it was a long walk. The Metro can quickly get one to the heart of Rome, but the metro doesn't go everywhere. For example, if you wanted to visit the Pantheon, you would need to find the right bus that goes there, or else be prepared for a long walk, or take a taxi, which would be expensive. I think if I could stay a week in Rome I would become familiar with Rome's bus system, and then getting around the city would not be a problem, but if you are staying just a day, as I did, it becomes a bit more problematic. In other words, if I went back to Rome, and was just staying a day or two, I would try to find a hotel within walking distance of the sights I wanted to see.

The lobby staff were for the most part helpful, but it seemed like we were bothering them when we asked for basic things like directions. I think they need to remember that they are in a service business and most visitors are not used to getting around in a country where perhaps they don't speak the language. The good news is that English seems to be the unofficial second language so most people you speak to can actually help you to get to where you want to go. While there is a pool, it is a small one and well suited for young kids to cool off in (3 ft deep). But, if we were to do it over, this hotel is really too far away to feel like you are near the main attractions in central Rome.

The breakfast was standard and not too terrible...although their juice machine produced a red fruit punch instead of orange juice which I found amusing. We had dinner there one night at the hotel and paid way too much or substandard food. The wine was good and cheap though! We vowed not to eat there again but we came back to the hotel one afternoon to shower and change for the evening and found ourselves stuck inside due to pouring down rain...normally we would've sucked it up and gone out in the rain but it was day 12 or travelling and we just weren't up for the challenge...needless to say we were stuck with room service for dinner.

This hotel is listed as a 4 star but I would find it hard to give it a 3 star rating. We arrived in Rome early evening on the 25/08/2008 staying for 4 nights. I arranged for a private transfer to the hotel with Airport-Shuttle.com which I had found on the net, no problems there, the driver didn\u2019t speak English but that was ok, it\u2019s about a 30 minute drive & cost us \u20ac90 for the return trip, you pay the driver cash, a taxi is about the same price & it was worth it for a ride in a nice Mercedes. When we arrived we were advised that our room was a basic one but there was an upgrade available, a superior room which also had a balcony (room 509), seeing both we decided to upgrade at an extra cost of \u20ac35 per night, this room was advertised as \u20ac295 per night on the hotel charges list so it should have been a good one. The electricity works by inserting your room key in a slot on the wall, ours worked with or without the key so that was a good start. Now for the bad bits, the shower head was all rusty, the shaving mirror had a crack the full length of it, the floor was wooden and every time you went out on to the balcony the edging strip came away, the kettle lead didn\u2019t reach the power point so you had to stand it on the floor to use it, house keeping cleaned the room daily but I still found personal items that the previous occupants had left behind & they should have replenished the milk etc each day but they didn\u2019t. This is a good one, there is SKY TV in the room, I was told there was only 1 English Channel but the cheek is they charge you \u20ac5 to activate it, I have never paid for TV before and I wasn\u2019t going to start now. The air conditioning was working but it makes a hell of a noise, you couldn\u2019t sleep with it on and with it off all you could hear was a low droning noise which was almost as bad, I\u2019m glad we were only there for 3 days I couldn\u2019t put up with it for two weeks! We took a look at the gym but all we found were painters redecorating the area by the lift. The good bits, the hotel offers a courtesy bus to take you into Rome, it leaves at 9:00, 9:45 & 10:30 with a pick up at 6:00pm if you need it, the minibus holds 8 & fills up fast so you need to book it at reception the day before, early. When I say they will pick you up at 6:00 it was more like 5:40 and they don\u2019t wait so I would get there by 5:30 if you don\u2019t want to miss it. You can get the bus (990) It takes about 10 minutes and stops by the Vatican wall, you get the bus tickets from the local bar, tobacco shop, you can\u2019t get them on the bus, the nearest bar is out of the hotel and turn left, at the bottom of the road (50 yards) turn left, its 30 yards up on the left, the tickets cost \u20ac1 for a single trip of up to 75 minutes or \u20ac4 for an all day ticket, to validate the ticket you put it through a machine on the bus, it\u2019s a little yellow box in the middle of the bus, the drivers not interested and we didn\u2019t see any ticket inspectors, (right or wrong if you buy a 1 trip ticket and don\u2019t validate it as we didn\u2019t you could use the same one all week, (this is what we were told the locals all do!) The bus stop is out of the hotel and turn left, at the bottom of the road turn right and it\u2019s 30ft down on the right, just down from there is a small supermarket where you can get milk etc, the rooms have a fridge so it will keep, its open until about 8pm I think. Being August most of the little shops in the area are shut but you can find the odd one open, we ate at a small pizza shop one evening and it was very nice, 2 drinks 2 large pieces of pizza and a Arancine Siciliane, (meat and rice thing a bit like a scotch egg without the egg) \u20ac10 the lot. Just walk past the bus stop to the bottom of the road, follow it round to the left and its 100 yards up on the left. There is no shopping centre as we know it in Rome, there is a large centre with over 200 shops outside Rome but you need the bus to get there, (well worth a visit) take the 990 from the hotel to the Vatican, cross the road and take the tube to the railway station, then get the 38 bus to the shopping centre, you can\u2019t miss it when you get there, it\u2019s called PORTA DI ROMA, when you leave the centre get the bus at the same place you got off as it does a full circle back to the train station, I would get a day bus ticket for \u20ac4 as it covers all bus and underground travel. It\u2019s a lot easier than it sounds, trust me. There are several things to look out for when using the restaurants and shops, the closer you are to the Vatican the dearer they are, and they add a service charge, they added \u20ac5 to our \u20ac22 bill so be ware, a bottle of water costs \u20ac0:60 if you get it from the small supermarket at the Trevi Fountain to \u20ac2:50 by the Vatican, a standard can of coke is \u20ac1 - \u20ac4:00 depending on where you get it and half a larger was \u20ac6:00. Eating on the hoof is always cheaper and just as easy and will cost you a lot less. I could go on all day with this so if you have any questions please e-mail me: joe@jhoward7.wanadoo.co.uk and I will see what I can answer for you.

The staff was helpful and courteous. No problems there. My only dislike about this hotel was it's location. This was my first time in Rome but I felt that this hotel was kind of far away from the main center of town. It was fairly close to the Vatican but pretty far from everything else. The hotel does offer a nice shuttle to the Vatican and one other stop closer to town. We took advantage of this once. There was a bus stop nearby but you have to figure out the bus system which is a little confusing. The nearest metro station is about a 10 minute walk. It's very easy to use but does not get you to all places. We had to take taxi's a couple of times which were a little expensive.

We had a bath with shower, the shower was great but we ended up with water all over the floor. In terms of location, we walked rather than use the local transport. There are some very good nearby restaurants, which we used in the evening. In the day we walked to the Metro, except for the days we went to the tennis and the day we walked to the Vatican museum. The walk to Cipro Metro is approx. 20 mins and its uphill on the way home. On the downside, we had numerous problems with our room or should I say rooms, which is why I had to give the hotel the rating I did. Its a shame because this could be a great hotel. I would advise people to check that everything in the room is working before they unpack. In our first room, the lights didn't work so they fixed that immediately. Then we set off to go out and the door locking was broken, so we ended up moving room. In our new room, we later on discovered that the air-con was broken, which we weren't happy about, being British and not used to hot weather! The air-con never got fixed in the 3 nights we were there and it did really annoy us, we found it just too hot to sleep. Oh and the final problem was our safe ran out of batteries. To some extent, I do think we were just unlucky. We were part of a group of 6 and one couple had no problems while the other couple had no air-con either. So in our experience, 2 out of 3 rooms had no air-con, so if this is important to you, check it when you arrive.", "Date": "May 14, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Northumberland", "Title": "\u201cVery nice hotel\u201d", "Author": "Doppelgangers", "ReviewID": "UR7237287", "Content": "We were a party of 10 couples who stayed at this hotel in February 2007.

On first impressions this hotel is in a quiet residential district but very hilly roads and a little isolated. The rooms were decent with double glazing but the bathroom only had a small shower. The breakfast is good compare to the Grand Ritz, with scrambled eggs and bacon. Freshly made coffee / tea /chocolate. The location is not brilliant altought there is the train FR3 stop Appiano right behind the hotel. The trains are infrequent, and stop early at night 10pm max. On our first night we caught the MR2 bus (in place of the metro routes) to the train stop Valle Aurelia, but discovered the last train had departed 15mins ago. Thought we could walk it back to the hotel, but got terribly lost...ended up asking a local restaurant to call a taxi for us.... didn't get back till 11:30pm. Definitely not a good idea to stay here if you want late nights out. All in all I would give this hotel an upper 3 star if minus the breakfast + service.

However, if you want somewhere convenient for the centre of Rome, then I'd look elsewhere. The hotel has a very contemporary style, which we loved. We wanted to be close to the Vatican (it was a 15 minute walk) and we wanted a quiet location away from the hussle and bussle. We also wanted good connections into the centre of Rome. The hotel perfectly matched our requirements. The beds were the most comfortable that I've ever had in a hotel, and I've done lots of travelling! However, the neighbouring area is spoilt by the amount of graffiti and posters on the walls. This is the case throughout Rome, and the authorities really need to tackle this, as it is very off-putting. Having said that, the area is very safe to walk around at night. If you decide to stay here, the local train station is a 2 minute walk around the corner, Trains go to Rome every 15 minutes and are very reliable. The station is called Via Appiano, which is one stop away from Valle Aurelia metro. There are lifts in both stations, which is handy for baggage. Breakfasts were very nice indeed, plenty of tea and coffee; scrambled aggs and bacon, selections of cereals and fruit, and a wonderful selection of pastries. The only let-down was the dinner. I had salmon in orange and mint sauce which I was really looking forward to, but it was too dry and a big disappointment. Hence, we dined elsewhere for the rest of the holiday. A nearby restaurant that we highly recommend is the Isola Della Pizza in Via Scriponi. You don't need to reserve , but it is very popular, so you may have to wait for a table.

I was seduced by the nice breakfast and good rooms (and the price). To be honest I would not stay here again. The rooms were fine (although our electricty kept breaking and we were unable to get the lights on) the breakfast was very average - I was expecting far more after reading these reviews, it was well presented and ok if you like eating cakes and sweet pastries but that aside nothing to write home about (great coffee). Location was poor, too far out, there was a train station right next door but by the time the train came in (every half and hour) it was easier to walk down to the Vatican and get the metro from there. This was pretty fast (and took about 10-15 minutes to walk down there). The Bus was very regular, really good but if I went to Rome again I would stay in the centre, Near the Collossium or Piazza di Spagna (Spanish Steps). The hotel had lots of tour groups staying there as well as Business people. If you were only staying for a night or two it is worth it...but if you are there longer and want to go sightseeing in the day and then nip back to get a shower and change before going out in the evening it is just too far...takes hours to get all the way back and then out again.!! The food places around the hotel were not much cop...they shut very early...even turned off the music to get us to leave quicker. The hotel do not serve food after 10pm as well.....! The centre of Rome is still alive and kicking at this time. Overall its a nice hotel, decent rooms, very good service, but too far out!

As I read some bad reviews about overbooking I sent an e-mail to the hotel 4 days before our trip to double-check and in one day I got a written confirmation from the general manager of the hotel that they couldn't wait to welcome us and of course, everything is OK with our booking.
