On the down side, the room i got was tiny and very poorly insulated against sound from the 2 neighboring rooms , in addition the fire door to the 3 rooms on the top level had no damper resulting in a loud bang avery time someone came or went.

I had booked online thinking a three star guest house near Oxford Street couldn't be all that bad. We weren't planning on spending much time in the hotel so thought that even if it was basic it would be fine as long as everything was clean and in decent condition. To be fair, the room seemed clean, it even smelt of bleach! It was not however in a good location nor in great condition. The room was at basement level, right next to the kitchen and the corridor stank of curried food. In the morning after the one night that we stayed, the tiny bathroom smelt like a fried breakfast and there was lots of rattling of crockery and cutlery and staff conversation right outside our bedroom door as the breakfast service was underway. The rumbling of nearby tube trains and trucks on the road outside added to a less than tranquil environment. The lighting in the room was dim and the carpet worn. The double bed was quite small (in both directions!) and we both had sore backs after sleeping in it. There was only one plug socket in the room and no full length mirror. The fittings in the bathroom were ancient - the window blind was damaged, the shower cubicle was small and the fixed shower head pointed directly at the shower curtain (hanging from its rusty rail) which resulted in flooding of the bathroom floor. In addition, the water drained from the shower tray so slowly that you ended up standing in three inches of water after a minute or two. We couldn't wait to get out of the hotel after staying the one night and just left early the next morning. Nobody asked us about our stay when we handed over the key, or even realised we were leaving a day early, and nobody at the hotel has been in contact with me since to ask. They got our money so they probably don't care. I think I have only stayed in one other place ever that felt as tatty and miserable as this hotel.

The bed is not a full size single, and the length of the room is the bed with a well placed wall mirror to give the appearance of depth. I could sit against the wall and put my legs across the bed width ways and my feel would touch the wall in front of me. A padded cell offers more freedom. I could physically touch both walls length ways at the same time. The en-suite is private, which is a plus, but it is small. I think this is fine considering the (lack of) size of the room. The shower head didn't work properly: it was broken at the head which meant that the water sprayed out in any direction and as the wall attachment had broken you had to hold the shower in your hand to shower at all. This is bearable, just. The previously mentioned are singularly annoying but collectively they become a joke. I wish I could say that the issues I had with the room stopped there.... The floor was sticky! Actually sticky. I don't mean the bathroom, I mean the actual bedroom carpet and I advise anyone who is staying there to not walk around barefoot, keep the shoes and socks on at all times! The bed sheets were not clean, or if they were, they were not adequately so. The bed was well made upon arrival (which suggests an admirable dexterity considering the size of the room) but when I pulled the sheets back I had to remove a number of hairs and other bits and pieces, it was not pleasant. I was convinced when sleeping that the bed was incredibly itchy and this did not make for a comfortable sleep (this may have been psychological, but based upon the condition I found the sheets in, I don't think so). The mattress also has a very high lip to it, which is quite uncomfortable, and seeing as the bed is not as wide as an average single, if you make any motion to turn over, you will feel this hard and high lip. Be warned. The bedroom door is not a full sized door-way either, which I suppose is to be expected considering this is a glorified broom cupboard. It is about 1.5ft wide, so keep that in mind. Perhaps the most disgusting thing was discovering some old, dirty male underwear on a shelf above the door, and goodness knows how long that has been there for. It really was the straw that broke the camel's back and I remember ringing my friends to describe the cell I was currently in finding it amusing (if I hadn't of laughed I would have been in tears). The hotel, or rather the cabin room I stayed in, is over priced. London is a very walkable city and one can easily get about quickly and without complication. If you are wanting a hotel that offers you a great location, the Hallam - on paper - offers that, but I would imagine there are better hotels around (in fact I know there are). If you do not know London and feel unsure about getting a hotel slightly further away, never fear, it really is easy to get around and I would suggest this over this hotel any day. I won't be staying there again. There were some positives, however, and it would be remiss of me not to mention them. The staff were all very friendly, always smiling and wishing the guests a good day/evening/night etc. The breakfast was a choice of either a full english or a continental (cereals). This is served promptly upon your arrival in the mornings in the hotel's basement. It provides enough to start your day. A weird quirk is that you have to leave your room key at the desk whenever your leave the hotel, even if you're popping to the Sainsbury's local for 2 mins. I suppose this means they know you're out of the room and can thus 'clean' it. Who knows. I won't be staying there again, nor will I recommend it to others, but it has provided me with a number of stories to tell my friends.

The third room still had a bad shower, bed was to short en still not clean. Tired of having to move my bags, I stayed in the last room.

I know I can get a better deal from a chain but I wanted to feel safe walking back to my hotel after an evening seminar at Birkbeck University. The warning that the room was a 'cabin room' was welcome honesty, which I took as a guide to the nature of the proprietor. This was a mistake on my part. As I was on business I only needed space to sleep and a bathroom. The room was the size of a cupboard and the rail for hanging clothes was higher than the door (in order that the door could pass under it), at 5'3'' this was very difficult to use. However, there was a bed, bedside table, a box of tissues, a window, a phone, a tv, cup with tea and coffee. The kettle was missing, so I called reception and on the second call they did send someone up with a kettle and a hair drier. With these two items added to the bedside table there wasn't room for anything else at all. The bedhead was extremely grimy cloth and the bed was not a full size single. The tv remote attached to the table had no batteries but they had provided another remote so the tv could be used. Although the view was fire escapes and offices, the windows (room and en-suite) did open for air. There was also a fan heater (which I didn't try) which propped the bedroom door open. The bedroom door was not a full-size door. The door from the hall opened into a space which was just adequate size to allow the door to be opened. This led to a tiny bathroom and the bedroom. I had a small backpack with me and had trouble getting into the room because of the restricted space. The doors had no interior locks at all (just opened with key from outside). I could touch both walls (room width) and there was just room to squash my bag (think school-backpack size) at the end of the bed (room length). It was a difficult space to get dressed in. The toilet seat was horrible. It was badly dis-coloured and had chips in the plastic. The shower head was too high for me to reach and not adjustable but I could remove it to hold (but couldn't reach to put it back). The shower curtain was the plastic, never washed and moldy kind. The cold tap did not work at all. I would have liked to avoid the shower (indeed avoid the bathroom full-stop) but you can't spend a day in London and not need a shower. The shower got very hot, which seemed good at first but it went on to become scalding (after I'd got soapy, of course). The temperature adjustment did not work at all. I tried all settings, while trying to hold the red hot metal shower-head away from me (remember I couldn't reach to put it back on the wall). All settings were scalding hot (even after waiting a while for a change in temperature). I tried turning the water off, waiting and turning it back on - still scalding. Decide to resort to trying to rinse using the tiny sink - but there was only the hot tap. Managed to get 3 glassfuls of warm water over my hair before this tap was scalding hot too. The hand towel was not clean - grey white. However it wasn't paper thin, so if they just gave the towels a boiling wash (they could even do it in-house with the temperature of their water), they could have acceptable towels. Unfortunately the sheets also needed a wash, the last person had brown hair and wore make-up - not facts you want to know from hotel bedsheets unless you are a forensic with CSI. The wall socket below the tv did not charge my phone - so it was a good job I can wake up without an alarm as my phone was dead by morning. It was also a good job I was dead tired because the room (14) is next to the lift shaft. After seeing the inside of the hotel I had opted to walk up to the 3rd floor as I didn't hold any hope of the lift being regularly serviced. Unfortunately others did not share this view and used the lift all night. In addition the bed was too small to move much (no problem of falling on the floor though as there wasn't enough room for a body - second thoughts: I could have got jammed between the wall and the bed and been there until the next guest checked in). Breakfast was a worrying thought. As it was inclusive my expenses would not stretch to buying alternative food and I had no idea if lunch would be provided at the seminar I was attending. Hence I made my way to the basement to eat. It was a relief to find it was edible. The crockery wasn't very clean (the person behind me asked for it to be changed) and my milk jug was only okay if I didn't put my reading glasses on. The tea was hot. There was one menu outside the dining room and a lady took the order. A choice of three cereals which were served to your table (no breakfast buffet); cornflakes, muesli and barnflakes (their spelling not mine). There were eggs, sausage, bacon, tomato and toast. No juice, white bread only and my eggs were scrambled. With the exception of the sausage (the cheapest of cheap sort) it was hot and passable but the cooked food arrived almost at the same time as the cereal (you could not have complained of slow service). All the other guests in the dining room were non-British European and I felt embarrassed that this is their experience of London hotels. I didn't complain because the proprietor (it seemed to be family run) must have known of these issues already and I would have been wasting my time with nothing to gain. I'd paid in advance. Unsurprisingly they didn't ask if my stay was comfortable or any other such departing enquiry. There's potential if they could be bothered: Wash the sheets, towels and shower curtain properly, fix the taps and water temperature, change the toilet-seat before it gets shabby and provide an interior lock.

It had got caught on a nail sticking out of the door and make quite a large hole!! We came back to what we named the \" flee pit \" we went into the reception area to collect our room key to find the man asleep on the sofa!!! Going into breakfast the next morning we we'nt expecting much. A lady who was dressed very scuffy handed us a menu, whilst cleaning our table she wiped all the crumbs on to the chair!!!! I would NEVER stay at this hotel again, the staff were extremely rude, the hotel was dirty, dark and very unwelcomming.

We have to travel up and down to London over the next 12 months at regular intervals for medical reasons. Bearing in mind the cost of this for flights etc we wanted to keep the accommodation 'reasonable' and in the right location. Therefore, the Hallam Hotel was priced really well and in the right area for us, so we booked. I have to admit that it was booked at short notice...so other than look at a few pictures online.....I didn't check on here first!! Oops! BIG mistake! So, we booked Feb 27th - March 2nd.....at a cost of \u00c2\u00a3253 for bed and breakfast. We are not naive, and realised that for this price, the hotel would be a bit dated, but expected it to be clean. We are not fussy or typical moaners...just expect what we pay for...and this is a 3* Hotel so we did expect it to be 'okay'. When we got to the hotel, we were soaked through and just wanted to dump our luggage, get dried off and get a warm drink...but as we walked into the hotel, our hearts sank as it was dark and gloomy and not the cleanest! Anyway, the next thing that alarmed us was the notice displayed on the desk stating \"We do not accept responsibility for personal items/luggage in this hotel\" or words to that effect. That wasn't a good sign.. we asked if there was a safe for guests...and there wasn't! Hmmm... We got the key for our room....and went to it. As we went into the room we just ground to a halt and stared around in dismay! It was GRIM!!!! All I will say is look at the photo's I'm adding to this review and make your own judgement about it. My partner told me he wasn't sleeping in it, and neither was I! So, the drowned rats went back to reception and asked for a refund. I told the receptionist that the room was like the Temple of Doom and that we were not sleeping or leaving our luggage etc in it! We were told it was POLICY that we couldn't get the money back. After a long 'erm..debate.....the outcome was that we could see the pictures online before nwe booked. Our argument was that the pics must have been taken years ago....and obviously when they had a cleaner!!! We said that it wasn't that we just didn't bother about staying there, but that is was poorly advertised and we weren't getting what we were paying for..or had seen true pictures of! We ended up in a debate about this 'policy' and it not being on display for guests to actually read. He then offered us another room..so we thought we'd check it out since we were there. I got to the top set of stairs and the cigarette smoke nearly knocked me on my back..it was disgusting. I couldn't even venture through it to get to the room...so went back and gave him the key back! Anyway, we got a refund for the 2nd and 3rd night but lost the money for that night. The receptionist told us to take up the complaint with the people we booked through. At that point, I took the key back, and my camera, and went back to the room and took a selection of photo's to support our complaint!! We took the chance and walked the streets looking for another hotel rather than sleep in that one. Eventually we got somewhere but cost nearly \u00c2\u00a3400 more (DRAT) but as it was the cup final day etc...there was literally \"No room at the inn!\" so we had to take what we could so we could get comfy. Needless to say we were hacked off and I complained to www.booking.com who liaised frequently with us...but we got no further with getting that 1st nigt's money back. Therefore, I feel that it is only fair to let others be fully aware of what they may encounter, should they consider booking the Hallam Hotel. We are back in London this week...but definitely not staying there!!!!!", "Date": "April 11, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "London, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cNot sure what all the complaining is about?\u201d", "Author": "fairyy", "ReviewID": "UR100989602", "Content": "I booked to stay in the Hallam Hotel for one night with my boyfriend as we had come to see 'Blood brothers'.

They offered me another room to the other side, but I had to wait till next afternoon and pack and leave the room I already got, by 11 am in the morning. I was too exhausted to do that, had had very exhausting experiences in the Airport and with the busfare to central London - and I had just packed everything out and was only staying for three days, so wouldn't spent my time on all that packing and waiting for another room. My best advice is: Buy earplugs! Because the construction work had been going on for two years already in one building and now they were building a whole new one next to that... So the receptionist said he reckoned it would take at least three more years before done... Furthermore, the hotel itself was under construction, making a new section of new rooms - right next to my room on the fourth floor (actually it was on fifth floor, but that's another story). Next issue, the hot water didn't work. It was too cold to use the first day, and the next day, after I had mentioned it, it went too hot. It was actually burning! I mentioned that, too, but after coming home 9 in the afternoon to discover it hadn't been fixed yet, I now saw a certain pattern; because the minibar, that I was depending on using as a fridge due to allergy, so I can buy and make my own sandwiches and keep milk fresh etc, hadn't been fixed either. It didn't work from day one, and I of course mentioned that at the same time I mentioned the water... I was going in the theater on the third day and now being on the second without \"decent\" water, I knew I had to push the hotel in order to fix it NOW. I didn't want to show up with dirty, flat hair or without having taken a decent shower, poor \"neighbours\" to sit next to me in the theater, if... The hotel did try to make the water, but I had to wait until 1 o'clock in the night, before they finally realised they had to offer me another room - with working water - to shower and wash my hair in. By that time I had gotten a little cranky, I admit... I was tired and had to dry my hair in the mittle of the night, it was four o'clock before i finally could lay my head on my own pillow... And knowing I would have to listen to this noise from the construction works four hours later, wasn't appealing to my \"good spirit\"... If the hotel get these things to work, the water issue and the fridge AND remember to tell on their website about the construction work, it's a fairly decent hotel.

The room I got to shower in though, was a \"true\" double room with a real double-bed and it's own shower, and space enough for it's own washing-basin placed at the end of the bed, a large mirror and lots of space in common.

We were very disappointed and decided never go back again to this hotel. Most of all because of the service! We were tempted to book this hotel because of its location. But the Hotel itself did not provide what we paid for. It wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t a cheap one too and we regret booking this Hotel. We made the reservation weeks ahead for us and for a few more family members. We were 3 couples. When we arrived one of the couples got a room down in the basement. It was horrible room and smelled so bad and so we asked the reception to change their room but they didn't even though we made our reservation weeks ago. So they decided to go find other hotel because it was impossible to stay there. We were all tiered from our journey and took them all afternoon find other hotel at such a short time. The hallam hotel manager did not care their guests had to leave because of their fault. We had to stay because we could not afford to pay extra money for other hotel at the last minute. Than after wasting half a day of our trip in helping our family member to book other hotel we settled down in our room only to find out in the middle of the shower that it was broken and the water wasn't warm. We notify the reception and they send someone to fix it. The next day the shower broke down again in middle of the shower!!! We asked the reception again to sent someone to fix is as soon as possible and they said they would, only they didn't and didn't let us know. We found out about it when we took a shower!!! When we asked why wasn't it fixed they said they could not get hold to the man who was supposed to fix it but tomorrow it would be fixed for sure. Can you believe this??? We were only for 5 days and they took their time!!! Than at night it was cold and the hit wasn't working so we asked them to turn on the hit. They said they would and we waited...and waited...and when we didn't feel the room was getting any warmer we called again the reception and complained about their attitude toward us so they did us a favor and sent to our room a small radiator which was too small to hit up the whole room. We began to realize that this hotel was a low quality one and there was no point in complaining about the problems we were having to anyone. But when we checked out we told all about our stay in the hotel and about how members of our family had to leave and the manager ignored us flat out!!! He said \" thank you for your staying in our hotel\" and that was it. He ignored us while talking with him!!! How rude of this men! He completely looked the other way pretending to be busy!!! He was very rude and offensive and for that kind of behavior we told ourselves never go back to Hallam hotel when visiting in London again! It is worth pay the extra money and book hotel that respect itself and its guest. A hotel that it's maintenance works spotless. We deserved to get what we paid for and we didn't. Our advise; don't be temped to book this hotel, its not worth your money by far!!! There are many other hotels near by that are much better that this poor hotel. For example the Astor court just next door.

We checked in around 9 PM on May 25th for a stay of five nights, and we were out the morning of May 26th. In retrospect, we should have left immediately, late hour or not. The room was on the ground floor just behind the reception area. I had booked this dog in early December, informing them we must have a non-smoking CLEAN room, as one of us has asthma. After dragging and squeezing the luggage through two entry doors, we entered the worst room I've had the unfortunate experience to witness in over 36 years of world travel. The carpeting was stained and filthy, with hair and microbes piled up in the corners. Besides being miniscule, it had a dank odor, which I still am unable to mentally identify. The shower/toilet area was the size of the heads on a sailboat, complete with mildew and mold on the bottom sides. The shower head was broken, so it dangled over the handles. The headboard was velvet tuck and roll, which was quite handy for collecting years of dust in the crevases, which is ideal for an asthmatic. The window was open, and feathers, feces and debris from the local pidgeon convention was a pleasant touch, not to mention the view was over the back alleyway and buildings. If you've seen any classic old mystery movies, the dark alleyway scenes were shot from this window - no doubt about it. The coffee pot was left partially filled with \"water\" and was unfit to use. Now here comes the clencher....as soon as we'd rectified ourselves to tough it out for one night, about three minutes into the bed, the entire room began to rumble. I honestly thought there was an earthquake for several seconds. This went on for approximately every two minutes for about 2 hours - perhaps longer. Turns out this establishment (or at least our room) was directly over the metro system. The bed was so small, I ended up partially lying on the nightstand, knocking the telephone off the hook, which sent off a dial tone that I mistook for a smoke alarm. In summary, as the old adage says, \"You get what you pay for...\" If you want a good location, there are three other hotels right in the same area (we went to the Holiday Inn).
