The hotel is located on a 10 minute walk from the MTR station in a quiet neighbourhood of the city. So it could be ideal for sightseeing. However it could be much more convenient if the hotel is situated closer to the MTR and near a centre station instead of the terminus station. The hotel itself has rooms which are very boutique stylish. The service is great and also the included breakfast was good. At breakfast you have four choices (A la carte). We arrived our first night late at night so we ordered room service. This food was also good and not expensive. The rooms are a little bit small, but so does every room in Hong Kong. The bed was excellent and the whole room was clean (instead of hairs in the shower). The room is perfectly planned out, after every little thing a lot of thinking has going on. This rooms are so well designed. You have a big tv, a dvd player, a safe, a fridge, a desk and much more all in a small room. There is also free wifi, which was pretty fast.

As said before we stayed there for 5 nights and we found the hotel excellent, the rooms were clean and had free bottled water and a wonderful strong shower which is always a big bonus. The bed was on the hard side but everything was clean and there was even a nice little 'chill' couch for you to enjoy the harbour view. We had stayed in the deluxe harbour view rooms which is slightly more than the other rooms, but I think the unhindered view of the harbour was worth it. The concierge desk was friendly enough and the porters were fine also and always greeted us when we returned. The location of the hotel is also quite good, 10 minutes walk to Seung Wan MTR and there are plenty of characterful restaurants and the surrounding areas are of the 'old Hong Kong' style.

Also, there was only a glass door on the toilet so pleasant viewing for anyone else in the room (NOT)!! The only wardrobe was a rack hanging from the ceiling.

The positives: Price / value for money: for about 80 Euros per night including breakfast for two and free internet you wouldn't expect much in Hong Kong. But actually you get a very nice room with cool furniture, a big TV + DVD Player, decent toilet amenities and even a cooked breakfast. Oh and there is even a water boiler in the room and some tea bags and instant coffee. In short all you need. Location: One metro stop from Central station, right on the water, really not much to complain. It could be a bit closer to the metro but it is easily doable on foot and there are also plenty of trams going there and the stop is right behind the hotel. The view: We got upgraded for free to a harbourview room which gives you a nice view. Would I have paid the extra 40 Euros per night (that we were asked to do when checking in to get the room we got in the end for free as they didn't have anything else ;)? No, I don't think so. But with the big panorama window and the bench right on the window it was very nice. Internet: Very fast, easy to connect and for free! Unfortunately still many other hotels charge for that and the speed is very often not great. So thumbs up for Hotel de Edge if you want to get some work done. Neutral: Breakfast: You have a choice of 6 different breakfasts which are served, so no buffet. The quality was good (especially really good coffee!) but you had to wait quite some time and the quantity was not huge but acceptable. Size of the room: Well this is HK, so it is quite tiny. As a result there is not much wardrobe space, and for the two of us it felt a bit cramped. But of a couple of day it is adequate and the big window gives an impression of more space. Entrance of the hotel: Doesn't look very fancy, you could easily miss it. Also no lobby to speak of, but didn't bother me. The negatives: Bathroom: very fancy bathroom but all with glass front (not frosted!). No problem if you are on your own, but if you are with a second person, no matter how 'close' you are I do not like the fact that from where ever you are in the room you have a direct view of the toilet bowl through the glass door. No way to hide. I was as said with my wife but there are still things I do not have to see ;) We in the end created some privacy using a couple of towels. Looks like the hotel had pity with us as on the second day we found a shower curtain that could be pulled in front of the glass door of the toilet which was a helper. Still I don't understand why not at least the lower part of the door is not frosted or made opaque in some way. Ventilation system: Through our ventilation system we got a strong smell of cigarette smoke, must be from one of the neighbouring rooms.

Its has a very odd aroma to our western noses :) There is lots to see and do, but enjoyed Hong Kong DisneyLand very much :) One thing i will say is when you arrive go to the Hong Kong tourist board in the Airport and ask them to write the hotel address down in Chinese, we used the airport express this is very economical way to get to the city fast! The only thing we found is there is normally a long queue for taxis in the Airport Express area. We found it much quicker by going upstairs, do not try and get a taxi from out side the station this is for set down only. We only found this out because of some very kind resident. If you cross the road and queue outside the IFC mall you will get a taxi in no time! And they are very cheap! And last of all HONG KONG is an amazing city!!!", "Date": "February 25, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Dusseldorf, Germany", "Title": "\u201cjust perfect\u201d", "Author": "Jane H", "ReviewID": "UR123827319", "Content": "I almost didn't book it because of the mixed reviews here and because I thought it's quite expensive, but this hotel is really very, very good - the design of the rooms, the furniture, the breakfast (choices and taste), free DVD rentals, the service of the people working there, etc. It's maybe a bit tough to find because the entrance it quite small and therefore a bit hard to see, but that's just the way it is in Hong Kong.

Higher situated rooms are much better! The whole hotel is very small, every floor hosts only 4 guest rooms, but you can also say \"pitoresque\", because they cared for all furniture details very well. The style is quite cool and modern! Having 4 rooms on 30 storeys leads to another problem: In \"rush hour\" you have to wait quite long for the lift! Breakfast is usually included in the price, but there is no buffet and ONLY 1 free drink is part of the arrangement. E.g. beside coffee you have to order and pay orange juice separately. The hotel staff is one of the very best I have expierencend in my last 10 years of business travel! Very personal, one guy e.g. speaks fluent german! Rooms are clean, and you will have some cookies every evening, with some cold (?) tea. The walk to MTR is 10 minutes, but you could also take a tram, which costs only 2,3 HKD!

The property is in a very narrow, tall building so many aspects are miniature, from the two small elevators to the lobby, located on the second floor, and the slim restaurant. The rooms that face the water have amazing views of the harbor. Located in the Western district, which specializes in dried seafood commerce, you might notice a subtle odor of fish outside, but not in the room. The rooms are very well appointed, and much attention has been devoted to using every bit of space wisely. Coming in after a long flight, a luxurious feather comforter, feather pillows and guest robes were a welcome luxury. A mini-bar, glassware and a coffee-maker were tucked into a corner cabinet. There were plenty of horizontal spaces to place suitcases and a window seat looked out over Victoria Harbor. A 40 inch flat screen TV, DVD, MP3 player and free Wi-Fi rounded out the room. The bathroom shower had an amazing amount of pressure, very welcomed to wash away jet lag. One challenge is that it can be a bit hard to find since the front door is in a narrow building among other narrow buildings. The entry leads into a small foyer, while the reception desk is located on the second floor. It\u2019s in an area where the roadway can be confusing. In addition, it is new so cab drivers may not be familiar with it. Go armed with directions provided by the hotel and spend some time with a map before you arrive for best results. Glo restaurant, on the second floor, served an excellent breakfast, made to order, rather than the ubiquitous buffet. Ingredients were fresh, and the food was prepared with care. Service was good.

The bed was cosy. Although the bathroom was small it was clean and bright. The Hotel is located on Hong Kong Island on Connaught Street West which is sea facing . It is across the road from the Macau ferry terminal. As you can imagine the view from the window is terrific. You get to see the sea/river between Kowloon and Hong Kong island, buildings in Kowloon, the harbour to the west and the beautiful green hills of Hong Kong.
