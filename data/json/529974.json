The breakfast is very standard, there is a choice of cereal, yoghurt, iced croissants, bread, ham and cheese and apples. The hotel was only 10 mins walk from the metro station so it was very easily accessible to the centre of Rome, the Coliseum metro was only 2 or 3 stops away. The room I stayed in was fine, it had a balcony and air conditioning, it was an average size, the bathroom was really clean and the room was cleaned everyday, it also had a tv but no tea or coffee facilities The only negative about this hotel is the area it is in - Garbatella. As soon as we arrived and walked out of the metro station....it was very smelly and the area was absolutely covered in rubbish, there is not a lot around. There are a couple of pizza restaurants that are cheap to eat at but I wouldn't recommend, also no one speaks any sort of English in this area it is a very typical Italian suburb.", "Date": "March 7, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "VAUX ROUILLAC FRANCE", "Title": "\u201cPleasant hotel with helpful staff\u201d", "Author": "Linda T", "ReviewID": "UR125506630", "Content": "We only had a two-night break in Rome and the hotel was well situated, only 3 stops on the metro from the Colisseum (the metro is easy to use).

Only one hitch - the room fronted the main road so there was traffic noise until quite late and then again from around 6.30-7.00 in the morning.Bathroom a bit small and maybe needed some \"freshening-up\".

We got a Groupon deal which included breakfast and was great value for money. At first, we were given a tiny room on the corner of the 1st floor (109) but when we asked to change this the receptionist obliged and we got a good-sized room (108) which looked out onto a road but was fairly quiet. The rooms are clean and airy and have satellite TV, a fridge and air con but no tea/coffee facilities - luckily we were prepared though! The bathroom was OK with a good shower. The continental breakfast was very nice with a good selection of cereals, yogurts, fruit, etc. We were also served glazed croissants which were delicious! For dinner, there are a few nice restaurants in the area and the city centre is very easily accessible. As with many places in Rome, the staff were friendly, helpful, and spoke very good English.

Hotel is located outside the centre in lets say \"calm area\". Rooms are smaller but for two persons its enough. Rooms are clean, and good equipped with TV, small refrigerator and AC. Our room had a balcony with a view to old houses. Hotel is near the local road but in the night traffic is not so huge and sleeping is comfortable with closed windows. Staff would like to be assisted, we have met only one time with receptionist who was not able to say the word in English, but it was late when we\u00b4ve arrived so we are suppose that he was only in night service. Breakfast was in common style - no problem, we did not have the dinner there so we cannot do review.

For Rome it was also quite cheap but that's because it is located 5 metro stops from the main sights so as long as you don't mind that then I would recommend this hotel without any real issues. Negatives: Air con was a bit dodgy and traffic outside was quite loud- In the winter I don't think either of these would matter as the rooms are double glazed but we just didn't close them to get some breeze. Breakfast is basic but did us. In short good value hotel a little out but Metro stop is only 5-10 min walk so that wasn't an issue for us.", "Date": "September 26, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Sofia, Bulgaria", "Title": "\u201cExcellent and affordable small hotel in a very nice neighborhood\u201d", "Author": "VladoNik", "ReviewID": "UR109786745", "Content": "The place was really nice and cozy, the personnel were very kind and basically everything was as we have wished it to be on our stay.

The hotel is an excellent value for money. It is situated in Garbatella, which is a quiet place with all kinds of shops nearby, I mean ALL! It's a nice and picturesque place away from the hustle and bustle of central Rome and the awful neighbourhood of termini. it is only 5-7 min from the metro station (yes I timed it and I m not fit!and it is easy to find even for me that I m a woman ;)) which is never crowded! and 2 stops from Colosseo (the only station u will need if you want to go sightseeing in ancient Rome)and 4 stops from Eur if you have a business meeting. Clean hotel with very kind and helpful staff. Yes it is a bit old but it is renovated. The breakfast is basic. In my previous stay in Rome I stayed in a hotel in termini which costed 50e more, it had the same breakfast, the same rooms, worst staff ever, drug addicts at the threshold and the awfully crowded termini station.

We reached Rome from Barcelona around 10 PM in the night and we took a shared cab from Fiumicino Airport and it took an hour to reach the hotel. We were happy that there is someone at the reception to receive us and they are English speaking (which is blessing for us). First impression, a very nice hotel in a quiet residential area. Reception was nice and check-in was very quick say around 5 minutes. Hotel has 4 floors with breakfast and reception on the ground floor and it has 2 elevators. We were little disappointed that there is no elevator for 4th floor (where we have given room) and we had trouble taking our huge bag one floor up. Room was clean & nice with some antic kind of look; it was small & good enough for two and for that price. All basic and needed stuff like TV, Aircon, heater, hair dryer and with safety locker inside the room are available. Shower cubicle in the bathroom is too small and it\u2019s not easy for someone who little heavy. There is NO restaurant in the hotel and no room service too. They serve only breakfast in the morning and apart from that nothing else. There is a small pizza store just outside the hotel and the food isn't great. Couples of eating places mostly take away near to the hotel. Breakfast was good with sweet stuff and cold meat. Best thing about this place is its very near to the center of tourist center. There is metro station nearby called \u201cGarbatella\u201d (blue line) and it takes 20mins walk from hotel. It is 3 stops away from the great Colosseum metro. All major attractions are in the metro blue-line and if want to go to Vatican, need to change to red line at Termini and Termini is regional/international train station. We had no trouble reaching the hotel or walking from Metro station to hotel even at 9 PM night and the roads are mostly empty at nights.", "Date": "December 9, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Cromwell New Zealand", "Title": "\u201cRecommendedxr\u201d", "Author": "pariol1", "ReviewID": "UR83578863", "Content": "Hotel Derby is a haven of tranquillity and friendliness away the frenzy of central Rome.
