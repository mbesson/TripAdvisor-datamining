We dropped our stuff in the room quickly because we wanted to explore the Fortress, did not return until much later, exhausted. It wasn't until we returned that we realized we were in a room that must have been used for prostitution - since I found a half-empty liquor bottle, price tag for negligee, disposable razor in the bathroom.....Not to mention no phone, no remote. My husband was already asleep when I discovered all of this, so we stayed the night. What they called a \"balcony\" was just a metal rail outside the windows. The Plaza below was noisy all night and the trash removal truck came at 4:00 am with VERY LOUD commotion. When I told the front desk the next day what the situation was, they said \"You weren't supposed to have that room\" - that was it.

The house is a very old structrure, very clean. We stayed in room 304 because we wanted a balcony. The room was very comfortable, enough space for my boyfriend & me. I only stay for one night, but next time I visit the area will definitelly stay longer. The price was right and if you compare it with other others in the area is exellent!. We didn't use the restaurant, since there were plenty of alternative around the hotel. In front of the hotel there is plaza with kiosk, taxi stop, a pharmacy and even a Marshall (just in case you forgot something at home). If you are taking a cruise from San Juan, this is a perfect hotel for before or after your cruise. The staff is not very friendly but we really didn't need anything from them. I think if you are looking for a luxury hotel and you are willing to pay the price for it, them you can stay in a different one. Old San Juan is a very old city and the structures are 100 of years old, you should not expect the same as when you visit Spain or any old country.

Since we had no way to call the front desk, my husband ended up having to make several trips up and down the stairs to get some of the issues resolved. The hotel was sold out so their only answer for the water problem was to offer us use of another room which was not being used because the front door often got stuck in the locked position trapping people inside the room. To which they once again laughed and said good luck. All in all, it was a horrible experience! We weren't expecting much since we had been there before but this was outrageous.
