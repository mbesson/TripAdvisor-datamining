They replied immediately. I did not regret booking this hotel because it is beside the Jordan Station or MTR which saves you time and energy because you will do a lot of walking in Hong Kong. It's hard to get around when your hotel is far from the MTR.We stayed there end of August and they reserved a De luxe room with 2 double bed for the 4 of us in one room, with a prize of just 1280 HK$ per night including a great buffet breakfast for 3. You will enjoy their breakfast with variety of food from ham, salad, cereal, dimsum, noodles, fried fish fillet etc. They all taste good!The room is surprisingly big although it has an old fashioned design. I heard that hotel rooms in Hong kong are very small but this one is not. The double bed can accomodate 2 people very well. And the room has a lot of space for moving around. I just don't know if this is also the case with their standard rooms...It includes a long sofa with table, a small meal area with 2 chairs and another table, a big cabinet with surprisingly a metal Bank Safe for money or jewelries. The toilet has a bath tub with no hair dryer, but good enough. So be sure to bring your own hair dryer but request for an adaptor for their socket. They also supplied us with fresh towels on a daily basis. The staff are okay, some are arrogant but most of them are accomodating with your questions.

The former should be updated in terms of the design, which is by the way an indespensable one for the edifice. Location wise, is very comfortable. Situated just beside the Jordan MTR station, very convenient for the future and existing clients and shoppers.

But it is very well located in downtown Kowloon on the bustling Nathan Road. You can walk to the Star Ferry terminal and nearby museums etc in less than 15 minutes. It is less than one minute's walk to Jordan MTR Station for rapid connections to Hong Kong Central and the whole network. The airport bus (line A21, cost HKD33 - do not take the more expensive so called flashier airport buses) stops virtually outside the hotel. And you also have nearby the bustling night market on Temple Street, with some decent and cheap open-air restaurants too (do visit 'Temple Spicy Crabs' - excellent!).The hotel's facilities are not extensive - no gym, sauna or such like. But the rooms, while not large, are clean and well kept. The staff were friendly and efficient with us. And the buffet breakfast in the modest looking 10th floor restaurant is surprisingly good, and is a snip at only HKD60 plus taxes.
