The price of the room was $69 and though the rooms looked fairly nice at first at 3 am we were woken up by the sound of banging and screaming in the room directly next to us. Our ghetto neighbors were banging furniture and screaming. The fight was frightening, so I reached for the phone to call the desk only to find that the phone did not work. I personally walked all the way to the desk to request that the hotel staff check on the occupants of the room next to us, they complied, moving us a few rooms down the hall. At that point we tried to salvage what was left of our night. In the morning we woke to find a very large dead cockroach right in front of our fridge and it looked like it had been their for some time. Finally we made it downstairs to enjoy the continental breakfast, which was set up in a with visible drywall and a sheet covering the rest of the construction area. The food was laid out on collapsable metal tables, and the tables in which we ate were surrounded by stain covered chairs. Needless to say we did not stay and eat there.

We selected the hotel based on price and the central location. We drove up to the hotel in a torrential downpour. Thank goodness for the covered portico. When we first checked in, we were given a room on the first floor at the very end of the hallway. The room was in the renovated section of the hotel. The bathroom was really modern and fresh. The bed was comfortable and felt clean. We had a refrigerator and small microwave. It was a really nice room, until the air conditioning unit broke at midnight. Since it is Phoenix and hot, it got really uncomfortable quickly in the room. We called the front desk but there were no more king rooms left for us to move into. We didn't mind moving to a double for the night, as long as they could move us into another king the next day. I think to make it up to us, they offered to move us into the suite on the fourth floor. It sounded great, but we had no idea that the room was nothing like the one we were leaving. The suite on the fourth floor was, to put it mildly, a huge dump and slightly scary to boot. The two rooms were not renovated since 1970. The carpet was horribly stained. I didn't want to walk on it in my bare feet. The bed sagged and the air conditioning kicked on and off for no reason. The dropped ceiling tiles were stained and a few were actually hanging off onto the armoire. I was extremely uncomfortable in the room and had a terrible nightmare in that bed. I refused to stay another night in there. My husband was not exactly pleased with having to switch rooms yet again, but the next morning after breakfast, I requested that we get switched to another king room, preferably on the first floor, since that was the only floor with the renovated rooms. We got another renovated room and actually enjoyed the rest of our time there. The breakfast was the same every morning - eggs, sausage, pastries and cereal. I didn't think it was all that fresh or that good, so we only went twice during our stay and skipped it the rest of the time. The small pool was packed with kids and so we opted not to fight the rugrats for a spot that wasn't getting splashed. The location is pretty close to the Metro Center and we were able to navigate around Phoenix pretty easily from there. The location did seem a bit sketchy but it is a freeway hotel. I don't think we would stay there again, especially if we can afford Scottsdale the next time. The renovated rooms are really nice but I wouldn't want to take the chance of getting one of the non-renovated rooms. And don't take them up on the offer to be moved to the fourth floor suite.

It's located in a vast wasteland of shopping centers (the \"MetroCenter\" turns out to be a shopping center that looks like every other shopping center in the country) and abandoned shopping centers that have turned into mega-churches. It's a fairly long ride to the airport, especially in Phoenix traffic, which is dreadful. There's a small pool with what I guess was water in it -- but I wouldn't risk swimming there! The staff was generally clueless -- one spent most of his time hitting a computer keyboard as hard as he could, complaining about the keys not working and had no idea how to get to the Frank Lloyd Wright house (though the advertisement for the hotel lists it as \"nearby\" -- it turns out it is on the other side of town).
