{"Reviews": [{"Content": "Horrible--do not stay I booked a room here several weeks in advance by telephone and even called a week prior to my arrival to confirm. When I got there, the clerk had no record and the hotel was fully booked. When I asked to speak to the manager, the most shockingly rude woman I have ever spoken to told me to get lost, and denied that I'd ever made the reservation. When I told her I had given a credit card number, she shrugged and said I must not have been available when they tried to confirm. Unbelievable. I have experienced mix-ups in hotels before, but never have I been subjected to such rudeness or gratuituous hostility. STay away from this place.", "Date": "Dec 10, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR647166888", "Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Business service": "1", "Cleanliness": "-1", "Check in / front desk": "1", "Overall": "1", "Value": "1", "Rooms": "-1", "Location": "2"}, "Author": "goanywherenyc"}, {"Content": "Mouse in La Salle!! In the beginning of my stay I found this hotel to be quite pleasant. It is very affordable, convenient, and appears to be nice. For the most part, the staff was kind and helpful. However, I would not recommend this hotel to anyone because there was a mouse in my room on the dresser. When I reported this to the front desk attendant, he was helpful and asked me if I wanted to move to another room. Trying to give the hotel the benefit of the doubt by telling myself- maybe it's just an isolated incidence of that one mouse in that particular room, I took him up on his offer to move to another room on the opposite side of the hotel. While in this room I again saw a mouse, this time it tried to run up on the bed. It became very obvious to me at this time that this hotel was not the one for me, and I wanted to alert other people about it as well. Both of the front desk attendants that I spoke to separately told me that they did not know of the hotel having mice, and that it may be due to the construction in the area since Hurricane Katrina. Whatever the reason, I know I will not be staying in this hotel again, and I advise you do the same.", "Date": "Aug 2, 2006", "ReviewID": "UR797916995", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "2", "Overall": "2", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "sdyoung04"}, {"Content": "Cheap sleep in the Quarter My husband  I call this our cheap sleep in the Quarter. We've stayed several times. It's more of a European-style hotel, meaning that some rooms share baths, mostly there are no frills, and there are various sizes and layouts of rooms. We will return because the price is right for a hotel at the edge of the Quarter. Our rooms have always been clean and the staff was very nice. We first stayed there 13 years ago and again about 5 years ago. We have not been recently, but will consider staying again sometime.", "Date": "Apr 6, 2005", "ReviewID": "UR812816023", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "3", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member"}, {"Content": "\u9289\u5b28\u5131\u9289\u7b3a\u5051\u9289\ue042\u5142\u9288\u6052\u4f05\u7ef6\u5fcb\u4ed2...   showReview(21747581, 'full');", "Date": "May 27, 2004", "ReviewID": "UR101236154", "Ratings": {"Service": "-1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "-1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "0", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "-1", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "lass="}], "HotelInfo": {"HotelURL": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g60864-d528248-r11471556-La_Salle_Hotel-New_Orleans_Louisiana.html", "HotelID": "528248", "Price": "$88"}}
