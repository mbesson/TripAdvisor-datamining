{"Reviews": [{"Content": "Satisfied! I stayed at this hotel on a stopover from Baltimore to Hawaii and since i had spent most of my funds on my Hawaiian vacation i was forced to stay at a budget hotel instead of a big brand name one. I can say i was pleasantly surprised by the all start hotel. It provided basic amenities and was a clean place. I have no real complaints about the hotel. The only way i could see this being a bad experience is if we had expected to get more for our money. We knowingly booked and expected a budget hotel and thats what we got. Anybody expecting anything else is in for a real disappointment.Hope this review helped.

The upside is that the rent is $150 weekly for a shared bath arrangement, and the desk is manned 24/7. They also have a communal kitchen, which is really a counter, sink and an oven/stove.For the price it's probably one of the better deals in SF if you're on a serious budget.The usual disaffected Indian Patel SF monopoly runs the joint, so service is unfriendly and spotty.-k", "Date": "Dec 15, 2003", "ReviewID": "UR227747793", "Ratings": {"Service": "-1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "-1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "2", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "-1", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member"}], "HotelInfo": {"HotelURL": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g60713-d291695-r8668066-All_Star_Hotel-San_Francisco_California.html", "HotelID": "291695", "Price": "Unkonwn"}}
