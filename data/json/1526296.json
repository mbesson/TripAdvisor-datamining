Rooms are simply furnished but functional and clean. Rooms have A/C, small refrigerator and TV. Free wireless is available throughout the hotel. Safe deposit boxes available. \"Happy Hour\" each afternoon in the lobby at 1700 features tea and biscuits. Hotel IS hard to find initially. If arriving via any method other than \"Metro\" as listed on the hotel website http://www.otelmartinenz.com/index.html (for example via taxi from Taksim Square) do the following: go to the Lalelei tram stop on Ordu Caddesi (Cd) (a cab driver will be able to find the tram stop, but not the hotel). Walk west (downhill) on Ordu Caddesi about 200 meters to Fethi Bey Cd/Koska Cd. On the north side of that corner is the Crowne Plaza Hotel and the Lalelei (Tulip) Mosque. Put the Crowne Plaza Hotel behind your left shoulder and the mosque behind your right shoulder and cross Ordu Cd to go south (downhill) on Koska Cd. The hotel will be about 100 meters from the intersection, on the right, up a flight of stairs (hotel marquee is high up on the entrance portal). The full breakfast on the seventh floor terrace is excellent and the view of the Sea of Marmara is fabulous.", "Date": "September 8, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Glasgow, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cNice hotel\u201d", "Author": "skhan786", "ReviewID": "UR116035376", "Content": "Stayed at this hotel for a week, the location was great, just a tram away from all the historic places..

It is obvious that hotel is renovated, so accommodation is ok. price of the hotel comparing to quality is great. Keep in mind that guests of hotel are mainly Russians and Ukrainians (possibly shop owners) so they can be pretty noisy (packing, unpacking .... quarreling). Breakfast is not quite good, but if you are not picky person should be ok. Service at lobby basically do not exist.... there are numerous small things which can be annoying, such as missing parts in bathroom, very small TV, not properly organized room, but i underline, for its price, it is great.", "Date": "March 19, 2010"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Otel Martinez", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g293974-d1526296-Reviews-Otel_Martinez-Istanbul.html", "Price": "$92 - $147*", "Address": "<address><span rel=\"v:address\"><span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">Koska Caddesi No:6</span> | <span class=\"extended-address\">1 Laleli</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:locality\">Istanbul</span> <span property=\"v:postal-code\">34130</span></span>, <span class=\"country-name\" property=\"v:country-name\">Turkey</span> </span></span></address>", "HotelID": "1526296", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/ProviderThumbnails/dirs/07/d9/07d9342017f765f949920678ea535bdd1large.jpg"}}
