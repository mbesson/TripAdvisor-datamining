We asked for our money back and they said they wouldn't give us that night back even though we had only been there for 15 mins.

My fiance and I stayed in a very nice hotel for the entire week before coming here. We wanted an extra night on the weekend in order to go out. Every where was either booked or so so expensive (and after paying a lot to stay the week, we didn't want to spend much more) but I would have payed another hundred dollars on top of the 130 we already paid instead of staying here. We are younger (20's) and I didn't think I would mind that much staying in a less nice place. I honestly felt scared for my life after seeing some of the people staying in this hotel. I always triple checked our hotel room door to make sure it was locked. Now on to the room... The second I walked in I began laughing hysterically because I didn't imagine the room could possibly be thatt bad. The ceiling was splattered all over with what looked like dried blood. Our TV I think was from 1980 and glowed bright green on every TV station. Our A/C unit did work, but it also looked like it was from 1980. The bed, to my surprise, was clean and there were no stains on the sheets. The bathroom blind was broken and pieces were jagging out randomly and it wouldn't go up or down. Being a small girl, I probably would have barely fit into the stand up shower. It was a very small square built into the wall. Thankfully we had already showered that day at our other hotel, so we never had to use it. The toilet was almost on the ground so to sit down on it I felt like I was falling over. The carpet was stained here and there and I never unpacked anything and kept our bags on the dresser. The room above us was awake and screaming/pounding on the floors and walls until at least 3:30am. We were thankfully out and up that late but I would have been infuriated had I wanted to go to bed sooner. It was definitely an experience which I will never be repeating again. Thank got it was only one night. Please just spend the extra money and go else where.

Talk about bait and switch. My boyfriend and I stayed over Labor Day Weekend 2008. The outside was dated but pretty much matched the surrounding hotels. At a second glance we noticed that many of the hotels, that were not part of a larger chain, were dated. (or run down) Like I said, the outside was dated but the lobby was nice. There was a tropical theme with palm trees inside. Nice front desk, seating area and coffe area. We were under the impression that we made a good choice. There are several buildings on site. We were in the main building just off the street. Granted there was a one story walk up with a wrap around porch to the lobby. That should have been a clue. We were on the third floor with no elevator. Once we made it to the first flight of steps beyond the lobby, everything changed .It was as if we were in the twlight zone. By the time we made it to the second floor with all of our bags, my boyfriend said that the hallway reminded him of \"the Shinning\". The carpet changed, the fixtures changed and so did the smell. It was like being in an old attic or grandma's house. Our room was a HOT MESS!!!! The room did not have peep hole like most places. There is a sign outside that stated, no guests after 11pm. (we did not see that on the way in). They also do not forward calls to the room after 11pm. That was not a problem and I will tell you why later. We had trouble with the key. When we got the room open we just stood there with our mouths open. We had a corner room with two windows. Mind you, the front window was a side by side window. One side was so dirty that we thought that it was raining. The other had broken blinds. Our room faced the street so that made chaning at night very intersting. The side window had a window unit air conditioner that appeared to be about 20 years old. All the windows had pull strings to lift and lower the blinds but no rod to vent the blinds. It was either all or nothing. The carpet was so old and dirty that we decided not to walk on it. We purchased attitional towels and the Tshirt factory and used them as mats on the floor. There were no hangers, ironing board, iron or alarm clock. The phone was mounted to the wall similar to a kitchen phone at home. We both have cell phones, Thank God!! The phone looked like it could use a good swipe with a clorox clean wipe. It was yellow. Not sure if it was purchased yellow but it was yellow now. The fire alarm was yellow and hanging from the ceiling. The sprinkler was covered with dust however, that was the least of our worries. The ceiling tiles were bent, covered with what looked to be grease and ill fitting. I asked my boyfriend to look up there for cameras. We were scared to sleep on the bed. We purchased two woven blankets for 9.99 each at the Tshirt factory to sleep on. My boyfriend laughed at me when I asked him to check under the bed for roaches or mouse traps. He did not find anything but I would not have been surprised if he did. I had a hard time closing the bathroom door, which by the way only had a knob on the inside. A vintage glass knob to be exact. There was a hook and circle to latch the door locked. It was similar to a porch latch. Good thing that we are close, we kept the door open all weekned. NICE!!! The sink was being held up with a rod similar to a broom stick. There was no stopper in the sink. I looked down expecting to find some jewerly but only found the lid to someones toothpaste. The mirror was like something from a funhouse. As I tried to do my makeup, I noticed there was a wave in the mirror. I just gave up. The outside bottom of the tub had rust. Not exactly sure how a tub can have rust on the outside, but it did. The floor was covered with vinal with a brick motif. UGLY> The toilet paper was on the back of the hopper because the bar that holds the roll was missing in action. We refused to use the towels or wash cloths because we could not tell if there were \"really\" clean. I am sure that they were but it was gross. The tub did not have a stopper so if you had small children you could not bathe them in the tub without some difficulty. The shower head had rust or mineral deposits on it. We purchased addtional flip flops to use as shower shoes and left them in the trash before checking out. We could not avoid taking a shower. Luckly we had anti=bacterial soap. We did avoid using the sink to brush our teeth. We used bottled water and mouth wash to rinse. There was a three drawer white dresser that appeared to be new or newer. We never unpacked. We removed the drawers and placed our bags in there. It was the cleanest thing in the room. There was a wall mounted small wicker mirror. similar to a teenage girls room, across the room that did not match a single thing in the room. It really was not easy to used because of the ackward location and lighting. Speaking of lighting. There was one overhead light. No table lamp. The bedroom light looked like a porch light. The bathroom light was just a bulb without a cover. There was a tv, that worked well and a remote. We purchased a can of Lysol at the store and sprayed everything...including the remote. The television was on top of a small fridge. We did not know what to expect on the inside the fridge. The bottom shelf on the door was missing the rail. The inside cabin had two shelves. I assume that when it was new the shelves were white plastic coated. Now the platic was peeling and had started to rust. We purchased drinks and left them in the bag. We quickly found out the the fridge worked better than the AC. Our drinks had ice crystals inside. That was not a problem. It was hot outside and our drinks were cold. The front desk said that there was a pool on the property. We decided to check it out trying to make the most out of a bad situation. Again, we stood there with our mouths open. The water did not have the sparkle that other pools had. Nor did it smell like chlorine.. I guess it was clean but it did not look refreshing. The chaise cushions were dingy and did not match. There was a coca-cola machine. that was a plus but we did not use the machine or the pool. I wanted to cry. I had envisioned a great romantic weekend and I was so turned off. My boyfriend suggested we change cloths and hit the town. I suggested getting a tetnus shot. He laughed but I knew I was being a bratty princess. He was being a good sport so I quickly changed my attitude. He did take me to the store to purchase supplies to make the place liveable. Like I mentioned, we purchased Lysol, towels, blankets, Napkins, cups and flip flops. Our bargin hotel turned into a money pit. After we checked out on Sunday we walked around to inquire about prices at other hotels. After I got home and unpacked I started to look for reviews so that we did not have the same horrible experience. We were going to go back in three weeks for the Sun Festival but today we decided not to go. We are going to plan a weekend in MD/DC Six Flags area insted. Next year we are thinking about Ocean City, NJ instead of MD. I really wish we took pictures. This place is something that you have to see to believe. On the bright side, we did have a parking pass and a short walk to the boardwalk.
