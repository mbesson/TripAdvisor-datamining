We booked a the all inclusive package which included meals, massage, and best of all day trips to our choice of locations. (We actually booked 3 multiple 2 day packages). The hotel is in an excellent site, a very short walk to the center of Ubud but yet across the road from rice fields. We had the pool view room. Beautiful pool. Statues all over the site. It is actually a small quiet hotel. The driver Komang was a wonderful person and drove us wherever we wanted to go in a brand new car. If you are going to Ubud we would very strongly recommend this hotel.", "Date": "Jun 15, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR261736256", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "3", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "5", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "MrDonnie"}, {"Content": "Lovely !

We decided to stay in the Ubud area, away from the crowd in Kuta Beach.Sahadewa Resort is a relatively new small hotel, with only 20 odd rooms. The room was nice and comfortable - aircond, tv, phone. The hotel was compact, but still managed to have a typical Balinese garden. The location is just outside the more touristy Monkey Forest Street, but still within easy walking distance. Less noise and crowd, but not too far from the restaurants, galleries, shops etc. Hotel runs a scheduled shuttle around Ubud. Sunset over the rice fields across the hotel was picturesque.Service was typical Balinese friendly, but not intrusive.Breakfast was included - American or Indonesian. Loved the fruits. Didn't try their other meals so couldn't comment.There's a spa in the hotel, but the Zen spa a short 2 minute walk away was much nicer and better value.For food, the famous Dirty Duck Restaurant is 5 min walk away. Try their crispy duck. Right across the road from the hotel is an Indian restaurant - Indian Delites - that served quite authetic Northen Indian food.The hotel's internet service is yet to be set up, although the PCs are there ! For internet access, just cross the road, right beside the Indian restaurant.Overall, a good choice if you prefer peace and quiet, rather than crowd and nightlive. For that , might as well go to Kuta", "Date": "Jul 17, 2006", "ReviewID": "UR626798718", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "4", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "KCCheah"}, {"Content": "\u59d8\u6751\u6e69\u9287\uff43\u4ef8\u59d8\u693c\u4f00\u9287\ue042\u501e\u9287\u4ff1\u4edc\u9288\u64b1\u4eb1\u951b?#x201d;   showReview(19161470, 'full');", "Date": "Jun 19, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR819350582", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "-1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "4", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "lass="}], "HotelInfo": {"HotelURL": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g297701-d584499-r17351325-Sahadewa_Resort_Spa-Ubud_Bali.html", "HotelID": "584499", "Price": "$69"}}
