Rooms were large, very clean, location was great and most of the staff were very helpful. Small complaint, maybe my fault for not understanding that Yorkville is very trendy and equally expensive area of Toronto, but wait staff at the Bar, ESPECIALLY THE BARTENDER, left much to be desired. Maybe because we were not in suits & ties, but the bartender was Rude and Arrogant to the point that we left after 20 minutes and there was no one in the bar, so it's not like we were unfairly taking up any of his time. The major complaint... temperatures in the rooms. I understand that we had unseasonably warm weather for March 16-18 and that it takes time to get an A/C system up and running, but temperature in both our rooms ranged from 78F to 82F (25C-27C) ALL NIGHT despite trying every setting possible on the in-room thermostat. When hadn't fallen asleep by 4:00am, went down to lobby to inquire. The desk clerk said it shouldn't be that hot... but couldn't offer help. Lucikly another hotel guest was behind me checking out, and indicated he had the same problem for 3 nights, had spoken to maintence and indicated all you could do is turn the thermostat completly off, as even when set to 60F it would still be pushing warm air into the room.. desk staff didn't know anything about this solution. Once turned off, room temperature dropped to 75F but nothing more could be done.

If your stay involves activities in \"uptown\" or \" Toronto north\" meaning Yonge/Bloor/BayAvenue /Sherbourne sts , you simply cannot beat the value offered by this hotel. Its not perfect by any means, but for what you pay its a bargain compared to any other hotel in the immediate area classified as a 4 star. The rooms are spacious. The mattresses are very comfortable with excellent quality linens and pillows. I opted for a suite upgrade for an extra $60 and it was worth every penny. Over 600 sq ft of living space with french doors separating a beautiful living room and the inviting bedroom. Mini fridge, Keurig coffee maker, 2 large flat screen tv's, and a nice sized bathroom with plenty of counter space. You can book this hotel through some internet sites and then opt for the upgrade as I did. Overall I paid $140 with breakfast included! Instead of the buffet I ordered room service which was on time and very good. PARKING> Ok.., from what I learned parking is at a premium anywhere in downtown Toronto. If you are parking here on the weekend, you simply have to enter throught the parking entrance to the Bay and hotel at the rear. I paid $10 for one night....not bad. I believe the rate changes during the week days. The staff are incredible here. They go all out to ensure your stay is an enjoyable one. Very friendly ,and helpful to answer all questions regarding points of interests and restaurants in the vicinity. Save your money and stay here. You will not be dissapointed. I stayed on the fifth floor and there are only 6 floors here. I always try to book as high as I can staying in a hotel as I find it quieter. Everything you need is close by including a 24 hour minimart right behind the hotel. Public transit is at your door. The Bellman is always ready and always polite. I will come back to this hotel.

The biggest challenge was the parking. 24 hour Valet parking is $35 (plus tip every-time they park and retrieve the car), and the alternatives are few and far between. There is an outdoor lot across the street and to the left that charges $10 flat rate from 6pm to 6am and another indoor lot on Charles Street, two blocks over that is a bit less.

I didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t handle the booking myself it was handled by the company who\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s function I was attending. I did however call the property ahead on the day of my stay to advise them of my Marriott Platinum Elite status and was assured that they had made a note of it. Two very simple things I like \u00e2\u20ac\u201c a HIGH floor and extra pillows \u00e2\u20ac\u201c which are both in my profile. Needless to say on check in at 1:00am \u00e2\u20ac\u201c I got neither! I was allocated a 2nd floor of a 6 Floor property, and the room was located about half a block walk from the elevators. Thats what I remembered about my last stay there, the never ending walk to the room! I have stayed here before, and it is not my hotel of choice in Toronto. On arrival there was no one t assist with luggage and car valet was not to be found. For $35.00 per night I expect a car valet to be there and at least a doorman to greet you and assist on arrival! Especially at 1:00am \u00e2\u20ac\u201c I mean it wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t rush hour! I had to return to front desk after my check in to drop car keys! After complaining to the GM the next day about the valet situation \u00e2\u20ac\u201c that was in fact swiftly addressed and my reservation was obviously flagged and I didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have any more issues with the valet. Valet parking is $35/day \u00e2\u20ac\u201c they don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t tell you about the Self parking which is available below the building for $17/day! I felt the least that they could do was to waive the parking fee for the first night!\u00e2\u20ac\u00a8 I don't consider this a luxury property. It has the standard features of a slightly old, full service Marriott and feels a little worn. The Concierge lounge is truly mediocre, with equally mediocre offerings. I was quite surprised as management informed me the hotel was over sold, but certainly the Concierge lounge [located on 6th floor] was not busy any of the peak times I went there. Lobby is functional but certainly not opulent and you definitely know you are not in the best hotel in town. The hotel is in fact very ordinary. It does have a great convenient location. The rooms are quite plain, but I had a large room, I wouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t describe it as the best view \u00e2\u20ac\u201c looking straight into another building and when I have stayed before I had equally depressing views. A lot of the rooms have a view of the interior courtyard. Room was however very comfortable and functional -- Great bed and \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcOK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 bathroom, a nice size desk, flat screen LCD TV. One thing I had never seen before anywhere is was a card advising that you can decline housekeeper service for some Marriott points - certainly I would not do this and find nothing worse than arriving back at my hotel room to a room that has not been cleaned. In fact the next day after leaving at 9am \u00e2\u20ac\u201c my room was not cleaned until 2:30pm! Some positives: - hotel has a good location and a fair price - direct connection to the shopping centre and self-park - The subway is just downstairs - There was also a small, but good market beside the Marriott .

From the very beginning the service was amazing! They pick the best of the best when hiring for their front desk because those ladies were the best concierge staff I had ever met. I had booked with Mariott Rewards which got me a discounted rate (only $126/room since it was a Summer weekend!) and even though it was one of the cheapest rates, I had requested 2 queen beds in each room (which didn't actually come with the room rate we were paying since only 2 double beds were included) but they still gave it to us. Usually when you make special requests at the time of booking (like extra towels or extra pillows) most hotels don't cater to those requests but the Marriott gave everything I requested. I asked for extra towels and extra foam pillows and all were in the rooms at check in. On top of that, the rooms were beautiful! Modern and spacious with comfortable beds. I had also mentioned to the lady at the front desk that it was my birthday since she asked what brought us to the hotel and a few hours into our stay someone brought up a platter of crackers, cheese & fruit with a birthday card attached! Talk about service, no hotel would ever go out of their way to make that extra effort to make their guests feel that special. When we got back from the partying (around 3am) we asked the concierge what time check out was and she said since we were coming back so late from partying she'll let us check out at 1pm instead of 11am free! She didn't even take down our room number so I assume this is a service they provide all guests which I personally find amazing because the one thing I dislike about going to hotels is that I need to wake up at a certain time to check out by 11am (which usually is too early for my liking). To top it all off, when we were walking out of the hotel at 1pm on Sunday the lady who checked us in said \"Happy Birthday Ms. Thomas, have an amazing day!\". She remembered my name and that it was my birthday! They have hundreds of guests check in everyday and yet she remembered my name! It blew my mind that service could be THAT good at a hotel.

The front desk staff were extremely helpful and pleasant (even going so far as to look around for ice cream places that were open late one night). The concierge was extremely friendly and also very, very helpful. She helped us to find family-friendly restaurants and helped us to navigate the subway with ease. All of the other staff we encountered were equally cheerful and pleasant - right down to the gentleman who brought us extra pillows and blankets. I think in many cases, you get what you give in regards to treatment from others. The rooms were larger than I anticipated for a big city. They were immaculate and very comfortable. Bath & Body works toiletries were a nice touch as well. One thing that would have been helpful to know in advance is that you cannot get a roll-away bed in a room with two queens. I wish I had known this prior to check-in. However, my youngest is 4 1/2 and we made a \"bed\" by pushing the two chairs in the room together. He fit well, was comfortable and thought it was \"cool\", thankfully. The hotel was quiet at night - no slamming doors, no noise from other rooms, just the faint sound of the subway passing below (which no one else noticed, until I was nice enough to point it out). There is no pool in this hotel. However, with so much to do nearby, we never missed it. I also was pleased that the hotel was never crowded feeling or super busy, even during our weekend stay. The area that the hotel is located in is wonderful. It is very clean, safe and filled with everything you could want nearby - the subway entrance is next door, a market across the street, plentiful restaurants (high-end to fast food) and a short walk to a charming neighborhood where we enjoyed handmade ice cream (Summer's Sweet Memories) later one evening. The hotel is also within easy walking distance to the Royal Ontario Museum. I questioned whether this museum would be interesting to three young boys, but let me tell you, do not miss it. We spent the entire day on the second floor. As an adult, I would love to go back to Toronto, just to visit the rest of the museum again. As for parking, use the public lot on Asquith street, just behind the hotel. Unless you plan on lots of coming and going in your car (which is completely unnecessary in Toronto), it's much less expensive than using the hotel valet. Also, be sure to check the rack near the concierge for coupons for many of the area attractions. You'll be happy to save some money after buying food in this city.

When we raised these issues with the manager, we were told that people had been smoking in the stairwell and therefore they were not false alarms and we were offered 5,000 Marriott points and the extra charge for our kid's rollaway bed was removed from the bill! Not good enough Marriott...this hotel is a disgrace to the brand and you need to do better. Secondary to this: the room was fine, housekeeping was good (and their job was made especially difficult by the constant disruption) but could not be sure as to the true nature of the view out towards Bloor as the windows were so filthy.

Starting with the front desk, you will be greeted by friendly, caring staff who will make every effort to ensure your accomodations are perfect.

The front desk is up-to-date on events occurring within the city, both current and upcoming. Please give Tamara, Sergio, Carol and all of the other staff my warm regards when you stay. For those who have access to the Concierge Lounge, you MUST meet George. He is one of the crown jewels of this hotel. George oversees the lounge in the evenings and maintains a clean, friendly environment with delicious appetizers (actually, you could make a meal off the appetizers). He was quick to enquire about my day, and then truly listened when it was \"one of those days\". The Bell Captain and staff are also fantastic. Victor will double-check to make certain that all of your luggage arrives safely from your mode of transportation to the lobby, as well as when you leave back safely into your taxi/limo.

The only downside to the room - it was kinda dark because it faced an inner courtyard. I was in the 'cheap' rooms, I guess. You could probably pay more for an upgrade, but for my rate I was thrilled with what I got. I'm so glad that many hotels are no longer gouging customers. The internet wasn't free, but it was a reasonable price ($13.60), and this hotel only charged taxes and a 15% service fee (gratuity) for room service. (In recent years, hotels had been charging an additional $4 delivery fee for room service, and then having a space for a tip in addition to the service fee which made room service way too expensive). They didn't have a space for tip on the room service bill because they already included it which I really liked. At the Toronto Marriott Bloor Yorkville, room service was very affordable!?!? I'm still in shock. The gym also had no views/not even a window if I recall correctly, but it was decent (very clean and new equipment). Next to the gym, there was also a coin-operated laundry.

The floorplan of the rooms is like a maze.... we had to walk quite a bit around the buidling to get to the room. Because of the design, the walls were thin and not sound-proof... get what I mean?? We can hear people closing & opening doors... hear them talking... hear them using the tap.... sighh... After my kids went to sleep.... hardly an hour later, there was this FIRE-ALARM that went off!!! It was a slow beat alarm, meaning it's just a warning. But it went on for more than 15 mintues before any announcement was made to thru the PA system. People were coming out of their rooms and talking loudly... wondering to evacuate or not, people slamming doors, etc... At last when the announcement came, they told us it's under investigation... So in total it took more than 20 mins for this whole drama. Not good when you have 2 cranky & sleepy kids, was someone toying around with the system? It announced that the alarm was triggered from the 20-something floor... but the hotel just had less than 10 floors. Huh??? what the... Why took so long to announce the cause? It could have prevented people from slamming doors or talking loudly outside the hallway. Alarms are good for the protection of the people... but this system is weird. A few days later when we came back from Niagara and were shopping along Bloor street, we saw firetrucks outside this hotel again!!! Whoaa... another false alarm?? come on! I complained about the lack & slowness of the announcement to the Hotel Mgr the next morning and he was also not friendly.... he didn't give me a \"customer-friendly\" answer or respond in the way that I'm used to when I stay at hotels that has an international brand.

It was a sentimental journey to the city where my parents met and were married. This weekend would have been my parents 50th wedding anniversary. The hotel was just perfect for our needs and I would highly recommend it. It is located in a very stylish, safe part of the city - in walking distance to museums and higher end stores (though we are not shoppers.) You can also access the subway through the lower level without having to go outside which was nice on the rainy days. There is also an underground shopping mall on that level. We arrived on Thursday evening and checked out on Sunday. We stayed on the concierge level in two of the executive suites and they were fantastic - very roomy, stylish, comfortable and clean. There were refrigerators and safes in the rooms. The beds were very comfortable. We had a late supper in Matisse and it was very tasty. I highly recommend the very tasty Mezze Dip appetizer. We also had breakfast in the restaurant and the buffet was generously supplied with a good assortment, including very heathful choices. I used the gym several times and it was much larger than many hotel gyms I've used before. It didn't have a pool, but I was looking for cardio and weight equipment, so that didn't matter to me. I like that Marriotts supply free throw away (if you want) headphones for people who forget to bring their own along. The staff was very friendly and accommodating from the valet and front desk to the housekeeping and restaurant staff. I decided to self park our rental car since we weren't going to be using it again until departure. The cost per day for valet parking (which gives you unlimited in and out access to the car) was $35. Self parking was $22 per day during the weekdays and then dropped to $15 per day for the weekends. Anyway, the valet was kind enough to let me follow him while he parked another car so I would know exactly where to park. I thought this was very nice, since the hotel wasn't going to be receiving the parking income from us. I would recommend asking about adding a breakfast package on to your hotel rate. It added $15 per person to the room rate. If you buy the buffet separately I believe it is $17.95 per person. Tip - There is a Longos supermarket next door to buy fruit, snacks and other foods if you want to make a picnic or have snacks for the room. Final Tip - We decided to fly into Buffalo, NY and rent a car and drive over the border. It saved us about $600 by doing this (3 people). It also gave us the chance to stop by Niagra Falls and a couple of vineyards along the way (and there are copious vineyards in the area). We did learn after the fact about Porter Airlines who flies prop planes out of the small airport in the city. They fly to Boston, our home city, and would have been a great deal if we had known about it when making plans.) Okay, that's it.

I chose the Bloor St location because I was able to use my Cat 1-4 free night stay certificates here and because the location was very convenient for some last minute Christmas shopping (Yorkville was a little less frantic than the Eaton Centre) and dinner out with friends in Rosedale. For our paid stay after Christmas, we chose the Bloor St location because it was a little less expensive than the Eaton Centre location was beside the Avis location where we'd picked up our rental car. Our first room was on the Concierge level and for our second stay we were on the 4th floor. There is nothing special about the Concierge level rooms - and the lounge was closed during the week before Christmas. While the rooms were large and well-equipped (love the comfy Marriott bed), the rooms and hallways feel cramped (low ceilings). Our second room was not as clean as the first. While there is nothing to complain about regarding the decor in the rooms or reception area, there is nothing remarkable about them either. This is a standard, smallish Marriott that is in good shape although not up to the minute in terms of its decor. There is a fairly well-equipped gym although it also feels a bit cramped because there are no windows. Because the lounge was closed, we were given coupons for breakfast in the lobby restaurant. Breakfast was a fairly good spread (although the eggs were almost cold on our second visit). We had an exceptionally helpful waiter on our first morning, who went out of his way to make sure we could get a complete selection of breakfast items even though the buffet was supposed to have to shut down - we'd been told by reception it closed at 11 when in fact it closed at 10:30 (which was when we arrived). Staff on the desk were also friendly and helpful. Would I stay here again? It would depend on price compared to the Eaton Centre location and whether I was in town for work or play. For a leisure stay, I'd probably choose the Bloor St location only if it was priced more than $15 below the Eaton Centre location. If I'm working, I'd probably choose the Eaton Centre Marriott or downtown Residence Inn. I'd definitely choose the Bloor St Marriott over the Courtyard (and the Bloor Marriott often is the same or not much more expensive than the Courtyard) or the Renaissance Downtown (which often is more expensive than either the Bloor Marriott or Courtyard - and not worth it, in my opinion).", "Date": "December 29, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "2", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "London, Canada", "Title": "\u201cAlright Hotel, Noisy Courtyard\u201d", "Author": "upsidedown_i", "ReviewID": "UR86528476", "Content": "We enjoyed the location and decor of the Marriott Yorkville.

This also included valet parking and buffet breakfast each morning. Our experience far exceeded anything we expected right from booking the accommodations with Carlo to the turn down staff at night. Not once in 3 days did we see anyone, staff or guests, with an unpleasant look on their face. We were greeted every time we passed reception with a the appropriate comment (have a good day, good night, welcome back) and a giant smile. When we asked for recommendations for places to eat they were always eager to help and were bang on with their suggestions. We took the train to Toronto and were able to hop on the subway and get off steps from the hotel. Everything that we wanted to do was either a 5-10 minute walk or a quick subway ride. So, we didn't use valet parking but did have experience with their staff as well. We stored our luggage before check in and after check out. This service was convenient and trust worthy. The buffet breakfast was a great start to our day. It was actually a full breakfast with eggs, sausage, bacon, potatoes, fruit, cereal, juice...the works. Again the wait staff were super friendly and the food was very tasty. We checked and the cost was about $15 which isn't unreasonable for a weekend breakfast included the best orange juice ever at a hotel. By the way I asked what kind it was because I wanted to buy some and the server told us it was a special Marriott blend that couldn't be bought --- darn! The room we got was extra special because of our prize and was located on the concierge level and had a king suite that was a place I could live in permanently. There were 42\" TV's in both rooms, a walk in closet and of course a very comfortable king size bed. If you are looking to be pampered for a weekend without a budget definitely pick the concierge level. You have special privileges in a private room that is like a hospitality suite including a couple of computers if you need one. There is turn down service each night that includes chocolates and they serve a cheese platter on the night of your arrival. I did 'peak' into a regular room and it had the same decor and was very clean. We quite often travel to Toronto but have never thought to stay downtown, all that has changed now! Marriott Bloor is our hotel of choice the next time we go to Toronto.

It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s on the northern edge of downtown and surrounded by restaurants and business offices. This older hotel has only 6 floors and is surrounded by business offices, so nice views are hard to come by. Next door is the Hudson Bay Company and TTC Subway station, great to get anywhere you need ($2.50/ride). Across the street at the corner of Bloor & Church is the Grace Hospital Health Centre, with a large paid parking lot ($10/Day on weekend & $30/day weekday). Proceeds from parking at the health centre go back to the hospital and is comparable to the hotel's $30/day. The lobby is small and serviced by a single restaurant/bar. There appears to be three elevators but only two were operational during my 3-night stay. Internet cost $17/day and I worked out at their gym daily \u00e2\u20ac\u201c nothing too impressive but it did the job. There was no pool but saunas are connected to the change rooms. My room was rather large (approx. 650sf) with a single king size bed. Granite counter tops and modern furniture are standard throughout the hotel. The flat panel television is larger than usual and provides a good amount of channels. The carpet looks new but the wallpaper is not. Nothing stood out in terms of style and rooms lacked a polished touch. During busy periods, you can hear your neighbours next door when they speak as the walls are thin. Pets are also allowed and I heard barking throughout the night. Staff members at the hotel are friendly and did their best but never seemed that busy. The hotel doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t seem to get as much business as some of the other hotels downtown. Room safes are provided for your valuables but there is no mini fridge. The temperature control never worked during my stay but held at a comfortable 73F temperature; fine by me.

It may not matter in the end to some, but if i shop a star rating & pay for it in accordance, i want it to be real. This one is a bit overrated. From the get-go, we stumbled upon a very lost check-in female clerk that didn't book the right number of beds for us. After taking multiple, clueless looks at our reservation voucher, she got the rudest manager, an petite Asian woman named Elizabeth, to second her in what turned out to be a disastrous (first-time) Marriott customer service experience for us & a show of insufferable intolerance by a Marriott's managing staff member. I would be tempted to call Elizabeth a 'b*tch' but my Mama raised me better than that... so I won't & have pity for her sad, angry heart. Of course, having booked our room with a third-party hotel room provider, Elizabeth was quick to conveniently say that they had nothing to do with the error & that we would have to seek for the third-party to solve it. That would be true IF i didn't check & got my official confirmation number with Marriott's direct reservation service (located in Miami) who confirmed, twice to my request, that 2 beds were indeed booked (3 weeks in advance) with other simple, less important, demands that were also grossly & uninterestedly overlooked. Basically, the hotel screwed this up for us & in a stride of really bad luck for Elizabeth, the customer behind me had THE SAME PROBLEM & was quick to enter the conversation, supporting us, understandably worrying about his own troubles ahead, with the possible & most likely identical outcome. We did NOT stay for that showdown. Then, in a manner that I could only relate to psychological & uncontrollable distress, Elizabeth tried to shut us, raising her voice saying, & I precisely quote: \"I am so sick of dealing with you both that I will bump down somebody else's room to a single bed & give it to you\". She added, mockingly: \" They will just have to deal with THAT when they check in\" (relating to the other, now bumped-down, customers). This is unspeakably displaced anger that no paying customers want to hear & a service 'faux-pas' worthy of unemployment! Even though I was happy to receive what I generously paid & asked for in advance, I was stunned & sadden for the other people that were now tricked with our problem & the person behind us who was also stuck in a ONE king-size bedroom with a party-of-4. We just moved on, deciding to try & enjoy our weekend in Toronto & let the mean woman suffer her job out. We had no energy for that. The room was very average with a view on old buildings. I would say that it was no better than a 3-star room. It was fairly clean & rather new, if not 3-star, not much more. The beds were comfortable, clean & soft. The room service was rather quick & friendly. The rest of the stay went smoothly & we did not see Elizabeth again, grinding her teeth at other poor unsuspecting tourists. Surprisingly, there is no pool in the hotel. I've been to 2-stars hotels in Mexico that had rooftop pools. This one doesn't have any. I've spent my weekend wondering where they got their star-ratings from & I am still clueless to how. I stay frequently in hotels (3, 4, & 5-stars) & I just can't figure it out. The hotel is quite well located & in a safe area. Access to the subway is footsteps away & it is to walkable distance to downtown. There are tons of very average & steep-looking Asian & Indian restaurants around & it is located in an older residential part north of downtown (Yorkville) that is slowly being transformed into a trendy neighborhood, yet that is for now quite ugly & need tons of work to be done. If you are looking to be stunned by the beauty & trendiness of your surroundings, please go elsewhere. Though I enjoyed my stay in Toronto, I would NOT book with this hotel again, & since this is my first stay at a Marriott, I would probably pick another hotel chain too.

It is right above one of Toronto's busy subway stations and surrounded by shops, restaurants and attractions. Inside there is a pleasant enough lobby and adjacent to it the Matisse restaurant. Having said all this however I have to say that my stay wasn't as pleasant as I would have liked. When comparing it to stays at the Marriott Copenhagen and the Jw Marriot Grand Lakes orlando, it fell a bit short of expectations. I'm a Marriott rewards member and generally favour this chain above the others for its customer service across properties but at this stay it was not up to par. I am a blind guest who requires a tad more attention when staying at a hotel and while this Marriott did assist me; I felt like I was being tolerated rather then being viewed as a valued guest. My room although large was a room for a wheelchair user; I guess blind/ wheelchair its all a disability to the front desk and gave me this room. I in turned asked for a regular room but when I said I was staying only one night, the manager stated the hotel was full. Yeah right, maybe so but as a Marriott rewards member they could have tried a little harder. There was nothing really wrong with the room but I would have prefered a bathtub rather then a walk in shower. Other then that minor quibble the room was comfortable and rather large. It had two sitting areas, two queen size beds, the vaunted 42 inch flat screen TV I didn't actually measure it and even a fridge which I had requested prier to arriving. It also had the plate of chocolate truffles and fruit which I requested prier as well. I guess for one night it wasn't bad. There was also a coffee maker and safe which were easy to use even for someone who is completely blind. I had a great meal at the restaurant Matisse which was rather quite affordable. My waiter offered to read the menu although by his tone it sounded like he wasn't thrilled to do so. The restaurant wasn't full at all so I wasn't holding him up in any way. It was the little things like these that really got to me. When i requested an escort upon chekc out, I was told I had to wait and to call back in ten minutes. Screw that and headed out myself. I wanted to try the fitness centre but time did not permit that in the end. I was told it was good with a sauna and changing facilities. Check out was a tad frustrating as the woman couldnt' get her printer to work. I merely wanted the bill read out to me and have each charge itemized. I did get this in the end. I guess to sum it up, while there was customer service it felt it was carried out by automatons rather then flesh and blood employees who were happy to be working in this profession.

I reserved a studio room (small suite) and specifically asked for it because my mother needed a walk in shower and this was almost the only hotel I could find in the area I wanted (near Bloor) that had an accessible room with two beds that was not a basic standard (read: small) room. The room was wonderful, large, clean and quiet (it faced Bloor street but despite construction little or no noise). For those who want a view: even this room didn't have much of a view - only a bit of Yonge street in the distance, and a large high rise across the street. Most of the rooms in the hotel face a central courtyard - again no view. But, we didn't come here for a view. We were more interested in comfort and location. The room had a small seating area with couch and chairs, and large walk in shower with higher toilet seat (accessible) and as well as two closets (one with a lower bar for those who are in wheelchair) and door had two peepholes - again a lower one for those in wheelchair. The spaciousness of the room was impressive. I also liked the toiletries (Bath and Body Works aromatherapy). Finally a lotion that was thicker than water and actually lubricated the skin. We had a very good price (almost half of what was quoted for a suite in a recent review) and it included complimentary breakfast (made via Marriott website). The staff were the most outstanding feature of this hotel - they were friendly, courteous, helpful and because the hotel is smaller than many others they remembered us day to day. One example: I asked someone at the front desk about printing my airline boarding passes, was directed to the concierge and later on the person at the front desk asked me if I had managed to get them printed - she wanted to make sure. Amazing! The valet service and the restaurant staff were the same way. Housekeeping was also great (room cleaned promptly, and saying hello and smiling in the hallway as we passed by). As others have noted, construction makes it a bit difficult getting around if you are using a car, but not impossible, and I was told construction would be done by this fall, so won't be an issue for much longer. The location is also a great feature as others have noted, with the Bloor-Yonge subway and the shopping underneath the hotel. The food in the restaurant was fine, although I think a different menu with some lighter and more vegetarian options would be my preference. I don't always have room for a large entree. Although I came here for leisure, I can see that this hotel would be fine for business. I made good use of the gym (well equipped).

I have been to Toronto many times before and this is my favorite part of town to be in. That said, I must mention that the hotel became a Marriott fairly recently and was under varoius owners before that (including a Radisson during which time I stayed previously). In its most recent reincarnation as a Marriott changes were made made to the hotel some good, some not as good. I will detail these now starting with the cons and getting this out of the way first. Cons: 1)The building housing the hotel is now a mixed-use hotel condo development with the condos occupying the upper floors and the Marriott hotel occupying the lower six floors (the sixth is the Concierge Level). What this means is that the views from the rooms in the rear (where my room was located) are decidedly urban (surrounded by other tall buildings rather than a sweeping panoramic view. When I asked about another view at reception, I was kindly told that the best rooms were in front of the hotel overlooking Bloor Street and that these were suites currently going for $450.00 Canadian! The remaining rooms were in back like mine or overlooking a charmless dark courtyard - the lady at reception said that I would not want one of those rooms; I appreciated her honesty on that point. So don't stay at this hotel expecting a panoramic view unless you choose a suite. That said, this issue was not a big enough deal to negatively impact my stay or prevent me from returning in the future. You are in a big city after all. . 2) Please note that if you plan on staying at this hotel in the near future that Bloor Street which fronts the hotel is under construction. If you are planning on spending a great deal of time in your room, I would suggest staying in the back of the hotel. The noise was audible but not awful, and then again this is an issue which would bother some people but probably not others. However think twice about staying in a courtyard facing room - if the staff steered me away from those rooms, that must say something, I think! On the bright side it looks as if the construction is winding down, so this may not be an issue for long. 3) Internet access is very expensive. If you connect in your room it costs $13.95 for 24 hrs. If you use the computers in the business center you must swipe your credit card and be charged a $5.00 minimum or 49 cents a minute. However, using your own computer in the lobby and restaurant is free! Why is it that most higher-end hotels keep charging for this service while midrange and lower-end hotels don't. Marriott, I enjoy staying at your hotels whenever I can, but this issue was a turn-off! On the bright side the business center computer does allow you to print airline boarding passes for free. 4) Breakfasts at the hotel are on the expensive side. $17.95 for the buffet and similarly high a la carte pricing, I would recommend the mall below the hotel in the morning (more on that below). I did have dinner at the hotel one night, which I very much enjoyed - sure, it was expensive, but the quality of the food and the service made this worth it. The restaurant by the way is called Matisse and is a beautiful, atmospheric room with paintings of the namesake artist all over the walls. Now for the pros and there were many: The rooms are spacious and beautifully furnished in a chic, modern style with elegant wood furniture and extremely comfortable beds with an abundance of pillows to choose from. I've always had a great sleep in Marriott beds and this hotel was no exception. The room also had an in-room safe (wish all hotels had these) and the biggest flat-screen TV i've seen in a hotel room. The chairs were super comfortable and the bathroom was the nicest I've seen in a long time - not huge, but generously laid out with knick-nack shelves on each side of the sink, high-end toiletries and a huge decadent showerhead that was a dream to use! The lobby is rather small but intimate at the same time - once the construction is over it will gain much-needed space. For now, guests must walk into the lobby through the valet park- ing entrance on the side - not a big deal but it takes a little getting used to. I must also mention the service at the hotel which was exemplary and courteous at all times and very helpful with any inquiries I had regarding either my stay or with sightseeing options in Toronto. Lastly, the Marriott's location is unbeatable. It is in Yorkville, one of Toronto's best neighbor- hoods and the building is located directly above the city's biggest subway stop and a network of underground shopping malls so that you have all-weather access to transportation and shopping without even going outdoors if you wish. To easily access the mall from the lobby, walk toward the elevators and make a left before you get to them - you will see a glass door which will lead you to either the stairs or elevator to the mall. Once down there the subway is to the right and a food court to the left where there are several places grab a quick and cheap breakfast, lunch or snack. Past the subway (to the right of the door leading to the mall there is also a Starbucks serving coffee, breakfast and pastries. Also in the same vicinity is Shoppers Drug Mart store open 24 hours. Apart from this you have acess to a variety of other shops and services right under the hotel and then you hop on the subway to anywhere in the city you want to go - can't be beat. So, despite some of my personal observations stated above, I would heartily recommend the Marriott Toronto Bloor-Yorkville as a handy and very comfortable base to explore Toronto, one of the most fascinating and freindliest cities in North America. I hope that your stay at this property will be a memorable one. I will certainly keep the hotel in mind for future visits to Toronto. I am sure it can only get better.", "Date": "July 23, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Texas", "Title": "\u201cGreat Hotel Great Location\u201d", "Author": "Texan24", "ReviewID": "UR34091919", "Content": "Went to Toronto to spend a few days for Gay Pride.

I was in town with some friends for the World Baseball Classic at Rogers Centre. Even though it is a ways away from Rogers Centre, the hotel is connected to an underground shopping mall and the subway line so that made it convenient to get to Rogers Centre and other places. Check in was fine. We arrived around 6pm and were going to valet park but the valet guy told us it was $10 to self-park and $30 to valet. I'm not sure why they mark up the valet cost so high because it was really easy to self-park. The ramp garage was big and the elevator led right into the hotel. The room was really nice. Clean, spacious and decorated very tastefully. It was nonsmoking and had 2 queen beds, as I requested. The beds were very comfortable. Only complaint about the room was that it was boiling. I turned the thermostat down to 60 and it did nothing. This is the second time I've experienced this at a Marriott - I stayed at the Marriott Eaton Centre in Toronto about a month prior and I had the same complaint. When I made my reservation, I had also requested a room on a high floor and extra towels. There were several extra towels set on the bed for us when we walked into the room, but our room was on the 2nd floor - just down the hall from meeting rooms and banquet halls. Fortunately, nothing was going on at the hotel that night so noise was not an issue. The hotel was in a great location. It was centrally located on Bloor St, surrounded by shopping and restaurants. Just a short walk away ($6 cab ride) was the neighborhood of Yorkville which had great bars and restaurants. We hung out at one that was recommended by the bellman. It was called Hemingways. Really inexpensive and good food. The hotel's restaurant was under construction so we did not eat there. We ate breakfast the next morning at Over Easy which was great, and several blocks from the hotel walking. Just a month ago I stayed at the Marriott Eaton Centre.

A quick call to the front desk and a concierge was at our door in minutes carrying our luggage to a new room. In addition they provided us with a free breakfast voucher for the troubles. The new room (King delux) was clean, very spacious and very very clean. The bathroom was spotless and pleasant to use. Room was very quiet and peaceful. Bed was very comfortable but if you don't like feather pillows you have to ask for others to be sent up--no problem. Breakfast was awesome. Buffet style with many non-conventional gourmet choices such as fresh fruit and cheeses, variety of healthy cereals, eggs., bacon, western sandwiches and a personalized chef to create custom omelets and waffles. One of the better breakfasts I've ever had. But good thing for the voucher or I wouldn't have payed the $16 per person. This hotel is a stones throw from Young street and the busy downtown shopping district. However, we were weathering out the biggest snow storm of the year so we opted not to go outside. Cool enough is that this hotel is located directly on top of the underground Hudson's Bay Center. A short flight of stairs down from the lobby and your in this underground mall. Not much to see or do here but it is directly connected to the subway. On Saturday we caught the subway under the hotel over to the Eaton's Centre and spent the day in the \"Underground City\" exploring and shopping. Never even needed to bring a jacket or go outside at all. Sat night, again down to the subway to the ACC and the leaf's game. Right there with no difficulty. Plus the hotel staff are amazing and always willing to help you find your way (maps provided). All in all this was a great weekend away and this was a superior hotel as far as we are concerned.

Usually when I stay in this area, I stay at the Intercontinental but the Marriott I found to be more welcoming. I believe the hotel had just received an extra AAA star to bring it up to a four star property. I think the service was great and was part of the reason for the upgraded rating. I opted to go with valet parking for the weekend which gave me the flexibility to come and go as I please. The fee is $30 which is quite standard for central Toronto. The best part of the hotel is the location. There is a subway station in the same building and a shopping mall. There is also a great many of high-end boutiques on Bloor St. and in the Yorkville area. You should be able to reach everything on foot unless heading further south to the Theatre district or Eaton Centre. In the warmer months, you could reach the South attractions in the city in about 20 minutes. One thing that I thought was great about the hotel was the pet-friendly policy. This was the first time I had brought my cocker spaniel with me on a leisure trip and the staff made me feel very welcome! Most hotels (I assume) that are pet-friendly allow pets but would rather not have them on the property. The desk staff and housekeepers all stopped to pet my dog and all seemed genuinely happy to see him. There is a non-refundable fee of $50 for small dogs, which is valid for the duration of the stay. I think this price is fair, as the alternative of putting him in a boarding facility would have been even more expensive for the two days. I would say that if you have a dog, the Marriott is a great option! The room was very large and clean with a mundane view of adjacent buildings. The TV is a standard 25\" unit and the washroom was nicely appointed in marble. The bed, was not as great as other four star properties I have visited and I found that the largest pillows should have been smaller. Other than that, I had a good night sleep. The other thing I noticed was how nice the housekeeping staff was. Whenever I left my room to go for a walk with my dog, they would all give me the biggest smiles and say hello. I thought they were very nice! There is also a business centre on the first floor if you need to connect to check email etc. I believe there were two computers and then two extra spots to hook up your own laptop.

We went with self parking which cost $10 a day. Finding your way from the parking garage to the hotel lobby can be confusing, it felt like we were walking through a maze as there were no signs on the walls or doors telling us which direction to go.

However, Bryan treated us very well; he upgraded our room from 1 king bed to 2 queen beds with no problems (there were 3 of us traveling) & gave us a very nice room (room 105). He also gave us a map of the area & showed us how to get to the Air Canada Centre from the hotel. Our room was very spacious & clean with updated, modern d\u00c3\u00a9cor.

Complimentary items included: A newspaper, coffee maker with coffee & teas; Bath & Body Works Orange Ginger Aromatherapy toiletries \u00e2\u20ac\u201c lotion, shampoo & conditioner; a shoe mitt, shower cap, a little baggie of Qtips & cotton balls, and 2 bars of soap. One bathrobe was also available for use. We all had a great nights sleep, the beds were very comfortable! Our room also had a TV inside a console, a desk, & 2 chairs & a table (with a few local magazines) near the window; the view from the window was a pleasant garden walk way. In room internet access was available for a fee (we didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t use it so I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m not sure of the cost), a business center was also located on our floor but we didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t use it either so I cannot provide information on it. Before heading to the B Boys show we took a walk down Younge Street (which is next to the hotel) & grabbed a bite to eat - there are many shops, restaurants & bars on Younge Street, all within walking distance of the hotel. If you are staying in Toronto for a few days I highly recommend getting a subway Day Pass ($8.50 CAD) which is good for 24 hours of unlimited subway & street car transportation.

The Concierge Lounge is managed in the evening by a girl named Joanne who was very nice and gave lots of great tips for around the city. Since the hotel is connected to both The Bay shopping area and has direct access to both Hertz and Avis rental cars. Very convienent. Minuses: The set up of room was not fully thought through. The desk is perpendicular to the television that is hidden inside the television armoire. So you can't watch TV and work at the desk unless the desk is wheeled to where you can see it. BUT, then the phone with speaker function and provided internet cable is so short that you can't bring that along.

Lastly, if you're in the Inner ring of rooms, your views are all of other guests windows. On top of that, the windows were somewhat opaque, so even in midday, with the sun fully shining, the room was abnormally dark.

Right outside the hotel, there is more top rated shopping on Bloor Street West and Yorkville. After a full day of sightseeing, it was wonderful to come back to my quiet and peaceful room.

Not too bad, but if you have trouble walking or do not like walking I strongly suggest the subway. If you manage to get a room on the first floor, there is a roof terrace there that can be fun to sit on at night and checkout the stars. There is an LCBO located directly below the hotel. When you're in the lobby to the right of the desk there is a door labelled shopping or parking, something like that. You go out there. Skip the elevator, take the door to the left of it and go down into the shopping centre. Hang a right and you will pass the Bay and the LCBO will be on your right.
