My room was located on the 18th floor, King bed was comfy and room spacious. Cleanliness was never and issue. The only issue was with the A/C.

We went here because we could use a corporate discount and even though I am Mexican, my friends are not, so we figured an American-style hotel situated right next to the US Embassy would be a safe bet. In terms of security, which was a concern for my American friends, it's a completely safe location and, like I said, the US Embassy is right next door, so (depending on your point of view) it's pretty well guarded and convenient in case of any emergency. The location in general is excellent. It's right on the Paseo de la Reforma, the main avenue in Mexico City and it's right smack in front of the Angel de Independencia statue. The Turibus bus tour ha a stop right across the street, so that's convenient as well (although doesn't stop all that regularly). We actually walked to the Zocalo from the hotel and it took us about 20-25min. It's right in front of la Zona Rosa, with cute restaurants and bars (and gay bars if you are so inclined). But I really recommend La Condesa which is also really close, the bars and restaurants were fantastic for a real Mexican experience. In terms of taxis, the hotel usually gaveus town cars which were easily 2 or 3 times more expensive than regular taxis, so buyer beware. I really recommend getting the number of a local taxi station and just calling them. It's not recommended to just hail a taxi on the street in Mexico City. In terms of the hotel, yes it does look a little old, but that wasn't too much trouble. I got a haircut and had a beer in the bar and both were ludicrously overpriced. You can get much cheaper harcuts and beer acriss Reforma in the Zora Rosa. But in general, I thuught the hotel was overpriced. It was our fault for getting a business hotel, but if I was paying that price in the US, I would be fine with it. But charging that amount (About $120 US dlls per night) is extorionate in Mexico. I fI return, I would stay at the NH in Zona Rosa or the Marriot nearby on Reforma. I didn't think the price was worth it as a tourist. This is not a complaint about the serice.

The hotel is a little old and worn in some spots, but the beds are amazingly comfortable and always in tip-top shape, and the other furniture like tables and chairs always seem to be in fine condition as well. Where one notices the wear is more in places like the bathroom, where the tiles are occasionally cracked, or the chrome is worn off the faucets around the edges. None of this lessens the comfort we enjoy at this hotel; it just seems lived in. The thing that really shines about this hotel, as others have noted, is the professional, attentive and friendly service. When problems arise, we find them to be dealt with swiftly and without a fuss. On our most recent stay, we were upgraded (SPG benefit) to a Reforma-view room where the air conditioning just did not function well. The lowest temperature we could get in the morning/afternoon in the room was 75 degrees, and that was with the curtains closed to block out the sun. We called the front desk and a person from maintenance arrived in less than ten minutes to fix the problem. He tinkered with it and told us that if the temperature did not decrease in 20 minutes, we should call down to the front desk and notify them that it was still not working. Unfortunately, whatever he did failed to fix the problem, so we called down. The same man arrived and upon seeing that it wasn't getting any better, called to the front desk and had us moved to another room down the hall that he had already confirmed to have a well-functioning unit. He even helped us move all our things from the first room to the second. I was also impressed by an experience I had with room service, where the person I spoke to noticed that I had ordered items from the vegetarian section of the room service menu (a nice new addition since our last stay), and informed me that the tomato soup that I ordered (not specifically listed under the vegetarian menu) was normally prepared with chicken stock, but if I preferred, they would be happy to make it with plain water. It's a great waiter that looks out for you like that, but it's amazing with someone from room service does. Because of the service, we try to stay at the Sheraton Maria Isabel every time we're in Mexico City. At times, the rates are high (weekends are cheaper than weekdays, and certain holidays are also more expensive there), but we feel like it is our home away from home when we are in the Distrito Federal. Many of the employees (especially the bellhops) have stayed on for several years, and recognize us on sight and greet us by name when we arrive. The wonderful guest relations staff always sends us a welcome treat, such as a plate of fresh fruit, even though we are hardly high-rollers, just frequent guests. I'd recommend this hotel highly, although I'd suggest trying to plan your stay around the weekend when it is cheaper. The Reforma-view rooms are well worth the price difference if you can afford them, and club-level rooms are also a good value because they include a nice buffet breakfast in the exclusive club lounge. It may be that the club-lounge breakfast is not available 7 days a week, as is the case with many hotels. If paying extra for club level and hoping to make use of this amenity, be sure to double check. A note on SPG benefits: while the upgrades may not be spectacular, the entire front desk staff seems to be well-informed about SPG procedures and always gives room-type upgrades and late check out (4 pm) to SPG Gold/Platinum members unless they are especially busy. Standard SPG members will be placed on special SPG floors.", "Date": "November 21, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Acapulco, Mexico", "Title": "\u201cReliable and well located.\u201d", "Author": "archibalda", "ReviewID": "UR120684742", "Content": "This hotel has an excellent location and although well past its glory days is still very comfortable.

Upon arrival I noticed little had changed in the lobby. Although large it is rather dull, uninviting and with low ceilings. Its proximity to the US Embassy (next door) was not particularly reassuring from a security perspective and the presence of highly armed police in the area also made me wonder but then Ineeded to remind myself that this is Mexico City. I was in a room on the top floor of the tower furthest from the lobby (Floor 22). My room was rather dark and cluttered and the bathroom is just of a very unusual design where the toilet is annexed off without a door and the bath is oddly placed with only a small gap to climb into it making it very colostophic. Also the light directly above the toilet was broken when I checked in however it was so late I decided not to report it until the next morning as I just really wanted to sleep. The next morning I attended the buffet breakfast and my goodness what a feast. Wonderful layout of fresh fruit, cold meats, juices, cereals, yoghurts, hot mexican dishes, bacons, sausages, eggs and an omlette counter. It was wonderful and a bargain also. When I returned to the room I found that it had already been made up despite not a sign of housekeeping anywhere, they seemed invisible the entire length of my 6 day stay and didnt make a noise but always had my room done quickly. I also noticed a little note in my bathroom apologising for the broken light assuring me that it had been fixed....ID FORGOTTEN TO REPORT IT! So very VERY impressed by this! The TV was flatscreen and contained a fair number of english language news, movie and general channels. I found all the staff I encountered to be extremely friendly and chatty. One porter particularly eagre to learn some irish phrases from me. The gym was particularly impressive with a good range of top of the range Life Fitness equipment although I do think the temperature could have been a bit cooler. Also the location is of note, despite my initial concerns about security in the area I found Zona Rosa to be a lively and safe place to walk with numerous wonderful restaurants within walking distance and of course the Silver Market which I enjoyed. There is also a Starbucks just off the lobby which was hand it you wanted a coffee and to go online for free. My only serious gripes with this hotel was the room service. I had ordered the Nachos and expecting a typical plate piles high with nachos and all that comes with it (and like I have similarly had in other Sheratons) I was disappointed to receive a meagre plate of just 17 small nacho chips with a little bit of cheese and guacamole added! All for the handsome price of almost \u00c2\u00a315!!! It was one of the smallest yet most expensive meals I had in Mexico and I felt very short changed, especially in the home of the Nacho. Also the wait for the lifts was almost excrutiating. With a bank of 3 lifts only 2 at best were working. I was on the top floor so was always left waiting. On one day only one lift was working, I waited 15 minutes for it to arrive at floor 22 and then it stopped at almost every level on the way down even though after about 7 stops it was full. It took me a total of 25 minutes to get from my room to the lobby! When 2 lifts worked the average was 5 minutes which is still totally unacceptable. But apart from those two negatives I still had a wonderful stay. The staff were exceptional and although the rooms could do with an overhaul (especially the bathrooms) it was an excellent Sheraton experience!

Seeing other hotels reminded me at how impersonal, large and generic these big hotels are. The staff really did their best but when you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re in a city for a short period as a tourist, the experience can be so much more when you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re staying somewhere more personable. Check-in was taking forever and a member of staff eventually escorted me to the Platinum level guest area which is a nice room off of the main lobby. A member of staff graciously checked me and I was whisked to my room. I was hoping for a room upgrade or at least a nice one but it was a throwback to the 1990\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s \u00e2\u20ac\u201c browns, old furniture, dark, chipped bathroom furnishings and boring.

The hotel is located very close to some embassies and generally considered to be quite safe. There are also plenty of western bank machines and immediately across from a large HSBC office. Behind the hotel are a variety of nice street stalls and on the other side is the Zona Rosa, a vibrant gay and going out area. Taxi from Mexico City airport is 152 pesos one way, pre paid which was nice and secure from the airport. The hotel offers a car service for 150 pesos which are immediately available and secure. The concierge described the cars as just 30% more than the radio taxis. The cars were convenient and made trips easy. Not a lot to say about this hotel.

I was very tired so I decided to treat myself to a nice meal on room service of shrimp cocktail, tenderloin steak and a glass of best red wine. I was told I was not allowed to have vegetables with my steak as it only came with chips so I had to order a separate portion of veg!!! When the order arrived I was presented with a small piece of steak with the rest of the plate covered with chips, no sauce - nothing - not even ketchup or mustard on the side and a plate of boring steamed vegetables with no flair whatsoever.

Lobby computers allowed 30mins per day but wasn't clear that it was 30mins straight, so after I used it for 10mins then went back in the evening the hotel wanted US$20 for one day access in the lobby. Lazy security at the front, they had 2 metal detectors with 5 workers standing around but made us line up to only go through 1 detector.

The hotel was beautiful, sophisticated and a nice place to stay in on weekend nights with its bar that has different types of live music. The cover is steep though, about $15 USD and the drinks expensive, $6 for a cerveza. We ate breakfast at the sansborns next door almost every morning. Great huevos rancheros and huevos con chorizo. The staff was great and made every effort to please us. The bathroom I was told had no A/C and I was told this was normal. This turned out to be a nuisance because who likes to sit on a toilet and sweat? The room's A/C was weak and never got as cold as we wanted. This was attended to 3x and never resolved to my comfort. We were allowed to check in early (8am), a plus. Try the tacos across the street from sansborns. They were the very best in all of DF, we ate there daily. I believe it was called Jaliso taqueria or something similiar. We are originally from guadalajara so these tacos were just like the ones from home. Save some $ and drink the little bottled waters next to the sink. They are free and replaced daily. The larger bottles next to the mini bar are $5. We went to the XOXO (convinience) store around the corner and stocked up on bottled water for the weekend. This is way cheaper than the mini bar. Desent sized rooms and bath area. One day I could see my chapstick on the drinking glass, after turn down service, which led me to believe the maids did not replace the drinking glasses. A new set was sent no problem. A starbucks is downstairs but we drank chocolate at VIPS in zona rosa instead. This hotel is always bustling during the day with business like persons and the starbucks keeps a nice buzz to it.

What a superb location!! Literally across the road is the Zona Rosa (or otherwise known as the Pink Zone - Gay area) and situated on the roundabout of Angel of Independance (one of Mexico City's landmarks). Zona Rosa has a mixture of venues including straight, gay, fast food, fancy restaurants, cute little bars... what a lovely tree lined area which is so diverse. A 10 minute walk down Paseo de la Reforma in the opposite direction to Zona Rosa and you will lead to a grandiose parkland area just past Torre Mayor - a fine example of Mexico City's modern day architechture. Further along is the zoo, intermixed with historic buildings housing various museums. If the historic centre is where you want take the subway or metro from Insurgentes (only about 10 minute walk through Zona Rose). It will cost you $2 pesos - that's only around 20cents getting off at Zocalo (there is a change of train along the way) - this system is one of the easiest systems I've come across. You could spend days around Zocalo and the old part of town - I wish I had of had longer... But anyway, getting back to the hotel.

I think you'll love it or not really be satisfied depending on how much you pay. The conference was charging $243 a night to stay at this hotel and when i was ready to book all the rooms were sold out. I booked directly through the Sheraton website and I got it for $190/night - and with that I got the \"romance package\" which meant I got a bottle of champagne and lovely cheese plate delivered to my room at check-in and 2 full \"american breakfasts\" delivered each morning. Since it was just me I asked them if I could get one breakfast and one dinner instead and they said that woudl be fine. Each american breakfast cost $19.00 US so that was a good deal. I was very happy with the hotel for what I paid. My room faced the angel of independence which was very pretty but a bit noisy. I didn't mind the noise b/c I liked the view - but if you want quiet you may not want to face the angel. My room also didnt have a mini bar or fridge which was a pain b/c there was nowhere for me to keep soda/beer, even the bottle of champagne they sent up, cold. I saw another room and that one had a mini fridge so you may want to ask for a room with one if that is important to you. There are lots of little shops right outside the hotel (\"oxxo\" is like their \"7-11\" and they sell cans of soda and cans of beers/coolers for around 80 cents each) - so it makes sense to buy some and keep them in your fridge. There are no ice machines on the floors - you have to phone room service and ask them to bring up ice if you want any (and end up tipping them) so it's better to have a fridge. As far as the location it was great. I felt very safe walking around. I am a woman and I was travelling alone and I had no problems at all. You can walk up the reforma to chapultapec (not sure if i spelled that right) park which is only about a 10 minute walk and that is really pretty. There is lots to see and do right around there. The turibus which costs $10 and takes you all over the city (double decker bus - you can hop on and off - your 'pass' lasts 24 hours so you can catch it one evening and do a spin around and then take it the next morning and get on/off as much as you want) is right outside the hotel in the circle with the angel so it's very convenient. The american embassy is right across the street - so in the mornings it is very crowded with longs lines of people (locals) waiting to get visas. There are 2 doors to the hotel - the pretty swanky one right in front of the angel and the \"back door\" where the people wait for the embassy and also where there is a local taxi stand. If you are going to be taking lots of taxis it is better to go out the back door of the hotel and catch a local cab from the taxi stand (they are the regulated ones \"sitio\" with meters, so they are very safe). It will be much cheaper than the hotel getting you a cab from the front door. If you go out the back door there is also a liquor store and a few convenience stores right there so it's very convenient to buy drinks/snacks rather than getting them from the hotel. The lobby is very nice and there is a lobby bar with about 6 computer monitors right there in the lobby bar. You get 1/2 hour free internet a day with your room. I didn't know this - the hotel staff didn't tell me - another guest told me then when I asked the staff they confirmed that that was right. Paying for internet for the day is very expensive so if you don't have a laptop but just want to get on for 1/2 hour it's great to sit in the piano bar and use it. There is also a cheap internet place outside the 'back door' too. The pool is gross. Really. I can't believe they even have a pool like that. I will post pics of it - it's no wonder they don't put pics of it on their website. If you are looking for a hotel where you are going to hang out by the pool this is not it. The pool is tiny and the walls are all chiping and they have that fake green carpet thing that is all soggy and gross. The weather was too bad to swim but I just went up to take a peek at it and I\"m glad I did. If I had my kids with me they wouldve been really disappointed. The hotel offers tours to the pyramids and all kinds of places. The prices are actually really good. It was cheaper taking their tours than booking them through the conference. I took the tour of the pyramids and the lady of guadeloupe. It was really really nice. It cost $35 US for the day to take you to both places on a nice air conditioned coach with an amazing guide (that didn't include lunch - they take you to a tourist trap type of place for lunch you have to pay yourself but it's really not expensive and it's still fun). You can either pay the hotel in pesos (350 pesos) or US ($35 US) or charge it to your room - but if you charge it they add another 10%. There are a bunch of different tours though - so as at the concierge if you are interested in that. My big piece of advice - and I wished someone had told me this - is that they take dollars 10 to 1 for pesos. Everyone I met took USD (from the street vendors, to the restaurants, etc.) and if it costs 120 pesos they would say $12 USD. However, if you go to the bank to try to change dollars to pesos you are only going to get an exchange of 9.85 so you'll end up losing as opposed to just paying with dollars. I really lost out b/c I brought travellers cheques with me. The hotel cashed them which was convenient but that was just at a rate of 9.77 to 1 so I lost quite a bit as opposed to just bringing the US cash. I took them to the bank to cash because they were advertising a rate of 9.85 but they said the rate of 9.85 was for US CASH, not travellers cheques, and there is a service fee for travellers cheques and the exchange would only be 9.74. I took them to the American Express office (which was right across from the hotel) to try to cash for dollars rather than pesos but they said that Mexico law prohibits giving out US cash and if you change US travellers cheques you can only get them back in pesos. They gave me a bit of a better rate - 9.79 - but still not as good as 10 to 1 so I wish I just brought cash. As far as the hotel goes it was a great experience. Great location, very friendly staff. They would ring your bell for no reason and say \"do you need anything, do you have laundry to take down\" etc. etc. If you don't like being bothered then leave out your \"do not disturb\" sign - otherwise they will ring quite often just to check it. but i found that nice. The room was very clean, nice big flat screen tv. very comfy beds, nice bath products. 4 free little bottles of water a day. The food was good. I got pretty tired of it after a while and it's very expensive - but as I had the credit it was good for me. When I checked out they gave me a bit of a hassle saying that I should not have gotten a dinner credit and only the 2 breakfasts and they were trying to charge me for all the dinners I got. I explained that their staff told me I could do this and they were aksing me the name of the person who said that etc. etc. A bit of a pain esp. as I was splitting a taxi to the airport with someone else so they were waiting on me. Finally they just removed the charges (as they should have), but I had to talk to the manager and spend a bit of time doing that. Ultimately, though, they stepped up and did the right thing so I can't really complain. Overall great hotel though. The Zona Rosa, the gay/lesbian little block is right across the street. Very nice little area - lots of shops and restaurants. The park with the museum of anthropology and other museums and market etc is, like I said, about a 10 minute walk. Very good location. Everybody was very polite and friendly. I speak ok spanish so that really helped. Very few people spoke english.

This is when I noticed the water sitting in the pipes. This is not a good thing for families with little kids. The closets are too small. I took a piece of soap and rubbed in the bottom of one of the glasses and put water in it to see if the maid would change the glass.

The service is well below 3rd class quality, the personnel were a little inept, and the security and safety were below the standards. This review is based on the fact that this is a Sheraton, an US hospitality enterprise, and the return in satisfaction compared to price/ rate. The rooms are small, not that comfortable, with not enough closet space and not well lit. The sound proofing and sealing was very bad. Noise travels easily from room-to-room, room-to-hallways, and the doors-to-frame do not seal well. The negative results were expected. Room service was friendly but above all not very customer service oriented. The hotel restaurant, Manhattan Deli, had the worst customer service I ever experienced. They did not like to take phone orders, hung on calls, had the orders wrong, were never timely, etc, etc. In terms of security, I had the terrible of experience of people attempting to gain access to my room in 5-times while I was in it. In 1-ocassion the security guards did not even bothered to investigate, in another incident took them 20-25 to respond to my room. Bear in mind, the security guards (5+) are always hovering on the lobby. Twice, room service walked on me without knocking the door or ringing the bell while checking for room availability. The evacuation charts are very confusing since they display several dots showing where you are standing. It seems that a template was prepared and used for different locations. I contacted the management in several occasions to point out my terrible experience, and they did not show much concern. Two individuals from my party abandoned the hotel before the end of our stay in disappointment.

It's also a good base for tourists wishing to explore more of the City and surrounding areas. I wasn't lucky enough to get a room/suite/mini-city in the 'Towers' of the hotel, so my 'regular' room in the main building overlooked the eternal queues which snake to the visa and consular section of the US embassy next door. The room was a little tired; not exactly in desperate need of renovation, but a bit of a refresh. Standard Sheraton fayre, really! Furnished with two queen beds, had four people occupied the room it would have definitely been a tight squeeze. There was an adequate wardrobe which houses an ironing board and iron plus the safe, which fitted my laptop perfectly. The bathroom was fine, with the toilet tucked away and the bath/shower partially concealed. Sufficient space for all your toiletries and plenty of towels provided, plus hairdryer. My big bugbear with this place is that they charge for ameneties/facilities which properties of this standard should not be doing. There is a coffee maker provided close to the minibar/mini-fridge, but the two coffee bags provided are charged for as part of the minibar list! Not acceptable. I'm not a gym-buny unfortunately, but access to the gym is also chargeable unless you are paying certain rates, (I'd enquire and get something confirmed - in writing - if this is appliccable to you). The rates quoted to colleagues varied a lot, too, so find this a little hard to trust. I also don't think its unreasonable to provide at least one bottle of water free of charge; tap water is apparently drinkable but not recommended. Three bottles are provided, but yep, you guessed it, at a fee. Staff are friendly enough but it all feels a little perfunctory, as if they are just going through the motions.

For 2 nights I was awaken by some moron in the other room blasting his TV at 3 am and 7 am. 2) Cigarette smoke. There is the smell of cigarette smoke on my non-smoking floor. For some reason, foreigners here love to smoke and can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t stop. So I ended up with a very bad sore throat because they couldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t stop the cigarette smokers on a NON-SMOKING FLOOR. 3) Horrible desks. Some idiot, who made the desk table, put a METAL BAR right near your shin (I kid you not!). So I would constantly hit my shin on the metal bar! It was unbelievable. Why would you construct a desk with a metal bar across the legs? If you want black and blue marks, stay at this hotel. 4) Bad beds for tall people. The sheets are NOT FITTED. This is an ongoing problem with a lot of hotels today. These idiots think most people are 5\u00e2\u20ac\u21229 and under. 5) Window wouldn't close. My window couldn't close all the way, so I had the monsterous machine noise sounding outside my window all night. I already changed rooms, so I couldn't bother them again. Again, the people at the Sheraton, with the exception of one manager, are extremely polite and efficient. However, I warn you that you may not have an enjoyable stay. Imagine trying to enjoy beautifu Mexico City on 4 hours of sleep - it's not fun. When you're in a foreign city, you want to be able to REST, RELAX, and SLEEP. This hotel is really worth: $50 a night. I paid $80 which was too much. The reason it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s currently selling at $175 or more is because of the oil companies causing world-wide inflation and havoc. Something has to be done about gasoline cars or everything will be overpriced. We must pass laws for electric cars soon or the world ends. But I digress.

I booked my reservation through my company's travel agent thus receiving the corporate rate for an executive \"suite\" room. When I checked in I was told that my corporate rate only guaranteed me a standard room, when I asked why, I was told that this was what my corporate rate allowed. I didn't argue too much because a) I had arrived late and b) I was really tired after having worked all day since 6 am and had just flown in from Monterrey from an event, all I wanted was a hot shower and a warm bed. I got to my room and to be honest, the Holiday Inn in Montreal, where I stayed at during my last vacation was better than the shabby room I got. When the bell hop showed me around the room, he turned on the lights from a faux drawer in the night table--it promptly fell down when he moved away. I looked up the hotel and the amenities that a \"standard\" room is supposed to have and I have yet to find the bathrobe, or VCR in the room. I got a blowdryer but only after I asked for it at the front desk and whad to blowdry my hair next to the coffee maker as ALL THREE outlets in the bathroom did not work. The one thing not listed in the amenites section was a weight from Weight Watchers which was broken. And to make things even more interesting, the floor I was staying on was in the process of renovating at least 3 or 4 rooms, so in the mornings I was greeted with the pleasant smell of paint and/or other smells. Also, the walls were so thin, I could hear what my neighbor in the next room was watching and I believe this was in part due to the fact that the control remotes are programmed not to go below a certain sound level. The front desk staff was helpful depending on who I spoke with. When I wanted to change my room I called ahead from my room and was told I could change to a higher floor at no extra charge but when I went to the actual front desk I was told that I would have to pay $150 IN ADDITION to my corporate rate which did not make sense at all since I wasn't going to be in the tower that looked out onto the avenue and where the rooms were more expensive. I later found out that they had a number of conferences and groups showing up the day after I checked in thus the shortage of rooms. I agree with the person who posted that they felt nickel and dimed during their stay: $14 per day for internet use?! $10 to use the gym?! $5 for using the coffee pot in the room?! why not just add these fees to the room rate? On an up note, a Starbucks in-house and really, really nice, professional, trustworthy and efficient taxi drivers were at my disposal and let me in on a few of the things the city had to offer.

The hotel does offer a small rooftop pool, although I did not get a chance to use it as my free time was so limited and the one time I could have used it - the hotel announced it was closed due to work being done on the conference floor it is on. TV has very limited international channels and had no free movie channels a la HBO or Cinemax. Internet access in the business center was $7.00 for 30 minutes - but you could walk a few blocks away and find Internet Cafes for $1.00 for an hour. That said, the bed was comfortable, bathroom and closets were spacious. However, just could not overcome the feeling they were trying to get every possible nickle out of me so I think I will stay at other hotels in the nearby Zona Rosa next time I go to Mexico City on business.", "Date": "April 26, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Manzanillo, Colima, Mexico", "Title": "\u201cExcellent hotel, great service, pet friendly\u201d", "Author": "nico_mbe", "ReviewID": "UR4694472", "Content": "I ended up in this hotel for a one-night stopover in Mexico City on a rather unusual journey... although we would normally have stayed in an airport hotel, I was travelling with my parents and their two dogs and this was the only hotel we could find in the whole of Mexico City which welcomes pets! The price was a little beyond my normal budget, and although I qualified for a negotiated rate I could not get it because the hotel was completely full (and that says something, since it is a huge hotel, around 750 rooms I think) But the service was first class and justified the money spent. Sheraton offer special Sweet Sleeper Dog Beds but none were available that day, so at check-in I was upgraded by the very courteous and friendly receptionist to a suite on the 14th floor (Towers section, like executive floors) with a beautiful view of Reforma and the Angel of Independence. I was there a few days after the Cubans were expelled. Whilst I strongly disapprove of the USA trying to apply its laws extra-territorially, I can't really blame the Sheraton management and staff for taking the decision to expel Cuban trade representatives on the orders of the US Treasury Dept. The management are just trying to run a good hotel and look after their guests, and happened to get caught up in a political row. It's not the hotel management's business to fight the US government, and the Cubans were no doubt well aware they were inviting controversy by choosing an American-owned hotel right next door to the US embassy for their business trip. Fortunately, there's a lovely piece of well kept lawn just in front of the US embassy and both dogs were able to do their business there after their 14 hour flight from Europe, in full view of the US guards and Mexican police. We ate dinner in one of the hotel's restaurants. Dinner was average and I would say overpriced. I would say there are much better dining options in Mexico City, but we were only there one night so of course it was convenient. Breakfast, on the other hand, was excellent, a real buffet feast of every type of breakfast you could imagine. The location is very central, but Mexico City is so big and spread out that you really need to choose a hotel near whatever you want to visit. If you are going there as a tourist, the location is great, near the Zona Rosa and historic centre. This is something of a classic hotel. At the time it was built, it was the largest hotel in Latin America. It has quite a history, being named after (if I've got my history right) Maria Isabel, wife of Sir James Goldsmith, and the daughter of Antenor Pati\u00c3\u00b1o, who built the hotel. Pati\u00c3\u00b1o was famous for, amongst many other things, the Las Hadas Hotel on the beach in Manzanillo. But there are no doubt more modern hotels which would be much more convenient for the newer business districts like Santa Fe. Still, this was one of the best city hotels I have stayed in in a long time, if not the best. I will certainly return.", "Date": "March 19, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "4", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Miami, Florida, USA", "Title": "\u201cOverall a nice experience\u201d", "Author": "Miami2", "ReviewID": "UR4594342", "Content": "I thought the rooms were large, well-decorated, with ample closet space.

Not too many shops to browse around, but it was nice to walk around with the touritst and locals. The place was bustling with life and excitement. Do not take the hotel taxi. It costs us $20 just to go to the Santa Fe Mall, which is 20 minutes away, but then again we are Puerto Rican and Filipino descent and could mix with the crowds so for fair skinned travelers you may have to be cautious. Anyhow, a great hotel that is smack in the middle of the business district with its wide and beautiful avenues that are perfectly safe to walk on at night because of the heavy police presence, just not enough shopping for women. In the springtime, there were these beautiful trees that i don't know the name of that were all blossoming with lavender flowers so the avenues looked really great.
