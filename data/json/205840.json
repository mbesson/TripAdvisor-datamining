The shower was awsome, just what you needed to get you started for a long day of walking. The room was clean and everything we needed was there. We couldn't get on the internet but didn't worry too much as we were far too busy sightseeing. The bed was a little hard but nothing like the one we slept in at the last hotel we stayed at, no springs in the back this time. There was extra pillows and blankets if you needed them. Breakfast: Excellent, plenty of choice, lots of it and really good quality. The waiters were very polite and helpful. All the staff were very helpful (especially the gentleman on reception in the mornings) and their English was very good. Nothing was too much trouble. I have been to Rome before with my husband and wish we had stayed at this hotel. This time I took my daughter for her 21st birthday. We had a wonderful time.

First trip to Rome so had no idea on the area or anything else and we were pleasently surprised on many fronts. First, the hotel itself was very nice. extremely well kept, clean, and everything worked. The staff was excellent. Very friendly and attentive. The front desk gave us several dinner recomendations and while I know it is common for this to be an arraingment between the two businesses rather than an actual great place, that is up to you to visit the recommended restaurent, check it out, have a look at the menu etc. We found two great places through the hotel, and several on our own. The Hotel has a bar just off the front desk that opens at 5. Nice little place with a great bartender. Expensive, as are drinks anywhere in Rome. (except wine) Vodka cocktail was 12 euro, (about 15 bucks) Although I had a few there, I also went round the corner and bought a whole bottle for about the same price as one drink. The room we had was on the second floor and was a \"standard room\", they do have an upgrade which was a little bigger. Our room was fine and actually was one of only three or four that have a small balconey, which we found great. Bed was a little hard, TV was pretty limited for english, and the shower was extremly small. Basically a tub/shower, but short and very narrow. You are definetly showering solo here :) --- Must say however, very clean, good water presure and hot!! Found the location to be very good. About a 15 minute walk from Termini station, the main train station, a Metro stop a block away, buses, taxi very plentiful. Also found the area very busy and safe both during the day and during the evening. We were out as late as 10 or so after dinner and found no issue at all with the people out and about. The actual Termini Station area, as I said about 15 minute walk away was a little sketchier.....the area around the hotel was fine, in fact 2 very high end hotels, St Regis Grand, and The Bernini are within a block. Many restaurents within a 10 minute walk in any direction and we walked to many major attractions. Trevi Fountain was about 15 minutes, and we walked to the Colosseum which was about 35-40 minutes but worth it because we saw so much along the way. You can take the Metro back. There is a Metro Station accross from the Colosseum, and one a block from the hotel. Would highly recommend this hotel based on comfort, value, staff, and location.", "Date": "April 11, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Leicester, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cWonderful Hotel in beautiful Rome!\u201d", "Author": "Swee_Swee_23", "ReviewID": "UR127541880", "Content": "Me and my boyfriend were booked in for 4 nights here at the Hotel Mascagni. The hotel was booked through Travel Republic and was sorted however there seemed a slight miscommunication somewhere. We went to check into the hotel of our 1st day and were told unfortunately there had been a mix up in our booking between Travel Republic, the agents and the hotel and they were expecting us the following day. Right, not a great start. In all fairness I don\u2019t think this was any fault of the hotel and I have contacted Travel Republic requesting an explanation for the situation. The gentleman at reception was very apologetic and explained how this was going to be resolved. The hotel had arranged for a one night stay at the Hotel Victoria. The hotel arranged for a taxi to take us their immediately, a contact name and number for who we needed to speak to at Hotel Victoria and explained that the next day we should leave our bags with Hotel Victoria and by the afternoon when we were to return to the Mascagni, our room would be ready with our bags already there. And true to their word the next day everything was sorted and they went out of their way to thank us for being understanding and gave us a complimentary bowl of fruit, a large bottle of wine and a lovely room at the back of the hotel which was pleasantly quiet. So I would not let this blip effect my overall perception of the hotel. The members of staff were friendly and polite. The room spacious, clean and smartly decorated, the bed very comfy and wooden shutters and heavy curtains meant no cracks of light in the early hours of the morning (so make sure an alarm is set if you need to get up early!) The bathroom was clean and spacious, good shower and the towels changed every day. The breakfast selection was tasty and nicely presented; don\u2019t expect to have a big fry up -there was scrambled egg and some small sausages but plenty of fruit, breads, pastries, fresh juices, cereal, jams etc. The Mascagni is a perfect location, right near the metro termini station \u2013 I would advise anybody to get the airport shuttle bus, this drops you right at the metro termini station and if you stay here at the Mascagni you can walk to the hotel no problem meaning you save loads by avoiding getting a taxi to and from the airport. The hotel is the perfect spot for walking to the Trevi fountain, a main road of shops, restaurants, the Pantheon, and other attractions. A short trip on the very easy metro for a euro at a time or 4 euro for a day ticket gets you to the Colosseum & the Vatican City in no time. There are only 2 lines on the Rome Underground so much easier than our London Underground so definitely use it you need too! Overall, me and my boyfriend had a wonderful time in Rome, it\u2019s a beautiful place, the Hotel Mascagni was lovely and I would definitely stay here again and recommend it to friends and family.", "Date": "April 9, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Florida", "Title": "\u201cNice Hotel - Internet Policy\u201d", "Author": "oneton60", "ReviewID": "UR127384556", "Content": "Nice rooms although somewhat small to be a triple.

The room was spacious, very clean and the bed comfortable. Breakfast was adequate. Not quite the range that I've had before in similarly priced hotels in Rome. Ok so back to the internet. For a start the wifi connection did not reach into the room so one had to go downstairs to the bar area or sit outside in an 'internet zone' in order to connect. Connecting problems aside the issue then became trying to load anything. Good luck with that. In fairness to the reception, they were sympathetic and one did try and restart the router to get it moving again but this was only a temporary boost. So overall - perfectly adequate.

We booked a taxi from the airport online before we left and it cost 40 euro, worth it to be driven directly to the hotel in around 40 minutes. We booked a superior room, which although not large was adequate and tastefully decorated. We requested a quiet room and were given one on the fourth floor, with a balcony at the back of the hotel overlooking a church. We slept well and were not disturbed by noise. The heating in the room can be controlled, so although the hotel was very warm we could turn the heating down in our room. We had a courtesy tray for tea and coffee and the slippers, robes and fluffy towels were welcome. The room was comfortable, kept very clean and linen was changed daily. The shower was powerful and the water hot. Although WIFI was free it was not possible to connect in the room and we had to go into the lobby area. The breakfast room is charming and the breakfast staff friendly and attentive. Breakfast suited our needs very well. Each day we had fruit and yogurt followed by scrambled eggs and toast or pastry. (If you expect full english you will be disappointed.) The hotel is located opposite the expensive Grand Regis hotel in quite a nice neighbourhood. On the first night we walked 15 mins to the Trevi fountain. The walk to the Roman Forum is about 25 mins or 2 stops on the metro which is a few minutes walk from the hotel. It is a long walk to the Vatican but we enjoyed it. We had to take a taxi back from the Vatican due to a public transport strike and it cost 20 euro. We booked a tour of the Colosseum and the Vatican with Angel tours and can highly recommend them, our guide Lindy, was superb and really brought things to life. On the first night the hotel recommended Target restaurant behind the hotel, we found it disappointing and did not go there again. We liked La Fontanella Sistina near the Piazza Barbarina, 5 mins walk, which is simple, served good fresh food at a reasonable price. We also ate well at Monti near the termini station.

We weren\u2019t let down, excellent B&B hotel! The air conditioning is the best I\u2019ve ever experienced, beds firm but comfortable, staff couldn\u2019t be more helpful and courteous, especially at check in. The bar on the ground floor is small but the bar staff were very sociable, the breakfast waiters and waitress were also very friendly. Whilst the breakfast area itself is a bit small for the size of hotel it was comfortable and the food was very good. Situated near the Termini station and the nearest metro of Republicca we found it in an ideal location to explore Rome. Big thumbs up from our family for the Mascagni! On arrival at the airport quite late at night we headed for the station however we opted to catch a minibus instead, at a cost of 70 euros for four of us (compared to 56 euros for the train) we got to experience a Rome taxi driver at first hand, interesting! We also picked up the Roma pass, definitely a must to get you into two sites and to cover the Metro. As others have said you can pretty much walk anywhere from the Hotel. We visited in August, it was hot in the late 30\u2019s. Our tactics were to get up at a reasonable time for breakfast and walk down to the chosen sight of the day. By lunchtime we were ready for a bite to eat so invariably found a good restaurant in the area we had visited (Piazza Navona and the square by the Pantheon being our favourites) then catch the bus back up to Republicca. We\u2019d then spend 2-3 hours in the hotel room cooling down before opting to go out again for the late afternoon and evening. Favourite restaurants, Ristorante Esperia on via Firenze off Via Nazionale (heading down from Republicca it\u2019s on your left), Trattoria Al Pantheon in the square. All in all a fantastic long weekend from Fri to Tues. On the last day we did the 110open bus ride and realised it was a mistake to leave it to the end. With the option to get on and get off at selected stops we should have used it earlier especially as the 50 euro ticket for a family of four (2 adults and 2 under 18s) lasted for two days. Finally as I\u2019m sure you would want to, you can\u2019t miss the Vatican, but do as my wife did and book your tickets on-line in advance to avoid the queues, it was very busy, use the metro to get there and get off at Ottaviano.

Great location near the Republica Metro station and close to the Termini RR station. Good walkable location to most attractions with the Vatican a short 20 minute Metro ride away. The rooms are very tastefully appointed. A/C worked fine. Bathroom was large. Very clean and quiet room. There are 6 floors plus the main floor, approx. 6-8 rooms per floor. We had a high floor (6th) facing the rear so noise was not a problem. I would imagine that a 2nd floor room facing the street would be a bit noisy but the windows seemed to have very good insulation. Breakfast was very good, not a large buffet type but perfectly adequate for the scale of the hotel. Staff was very accomodating at all times. There is a small lounge and bar area on the first floor but the is not the type of hotel where one would be looking to hang out in the lounge other than for quiet relaxation. Do not attempt to bring your own glass of wine as this is a no go. Also, as consistent with smaller hotels in Europe, there is one small elevator. Patience required or get your exercise. In any event, it is a very nice change of pace from your larger scale hotels.

I will try to explain everything with fact and without emotion, because my experience was so utterly horrifying and strange that it should not require emotional emphasis. I checked in to the Hotel Mascagni with my two friends E and K (both women my age). The man behind the front desk (Luciano \u2013 I will never forget his name \u2013 Luciano) checked us in \u2013 this included photocopying our passports - and we went to our room. My friend K immediately put her things (wallet, checkbook, passport) into the room safe because she had them on hand. My friend E and I took a moment to take off our shoes, etc. When we went to open the safe, however, it would not open, even with the code. We called down to the lobby for help, and Luciano said he would send \u201cthe boy\u201d up (\u201cthe boy\u201d was the bellhop Giuseppe) to fix it. No one came for some time, so we decided to hide our passports in a drawer under some papers because we hadn\u2019t eaten all day and we were starving. We went out for a quick bite and walked around, returning two hours later. When we returned, Giuseppe followed us up and opened the safe. K\u2019s items were still there. However, when we went to get the two other hidden passports out of the drawer to put in the safe, my friend E\u2019s was missing. We searched the entire room before realizing that it was officially gone. Just hers, mind you \u2013 mine and K\u2019s were still there. E called her parents, both seasoned attorneys, and they advised her to call the police and file a report. We went downstairs to talk to Luciano, telling him the passport was missing. \u201cThat is impossible! You have clearly just lost it. Look again.\u201d (He sent Giuseppe up with us \u2013 he lifted up beds that we had already checked under, moved furniture we had already checked behind, and when we asked what to do next, he just shook his head and left the room.) We went back downstairs and asked Luciano to call the police. He tried repeatedly to deter us from this. He wasn\u2019t the best English speaker, so E tried to get him on the phone with her father, who speaks Italian rather well. He refused. Finally, he called the police. NOTE: It is important at this point to note that while my friend E and I do not speak Italian incredibly well, we understand it well. So we understood everything he said while speaking in Italian on the phone. While on the phone with the police, he did not report the passport as stolen. Rather, he said that \u201cthree little girls\u201d had \u201clost\u201d one of their passports. I can understand not wanting a police report with your hotel on file, but he essentially called the police and told them to not come because we were being \u201csilly.\u201d He said, \u201cShe tried to put me on the phone with her father, how ridiculous is that? What would that do?\u201d He repeatedly got the facts wrong, and although we corrected him many times, he didn\u2019t seem to care about the actual details of the story. Here\u2019s a gem from this phone conversation: \u201cWe are like a family here, we would never steal. I can understand if it was a ring, or a hundred bucks, but a passport? And just one passport?\u201d (So, just to be clear, you would never steal unless it was money or jewelry. Classy.) He hung up and told us that a police officer couldn\u2019t come \u201cbecause no force had been used.\u201d To this day, I am not aware if this is an actual thing in Rome. But I\u2019m fairly certain that the fact that he had not actually reported the crime that had occurred is why they didn\u2019t come. He then started talking to someone else on the phone, presumably the manager of the hotel. Still unaware that we understood everything he was saying, he said, in Italian, \u201cI\u2019ve got the little one and the fat one here.\u201d Now, I am overweight. But he is apparently in the industry of hospitality, and even normal human beings know not to call people fat right in front of them. That was it for me \u2013 I immediately got onto the INCREDIBLY slow Internet and started finding a new hotel. He had burned this bridge. At this point, it didn\u2019t matter if the passport did turn up; I wasn\u2019t spending another second there. I called the company I had booked with, and immediately demanded a refund. They promptly called the hotel, and Luciano proceeded to tell them the story that we \u201clittle girls\u201d had \u201clost\u201d the passport, and we were just being silly. My friend asked for the copy of her passport he had taken, and when he handed it to her, he said condescendingly, \u201cHere you go, try not to lose it!\u201d We went upstairs and packed our bags. As we got in a cab to go to another hotel, we turned to Luciano. \u201cBy the way, you should know that we understand Italian. And I heard you call me fat.\u201d I said this loudly enough so everyone in the hotel lobby could hear. Very movie-moment. He denied it. He vehemently denied it. But then, as we put our things in the taxi, he came outside again and said, \u201cWell, anyway, you are the more bigger one!\u201d and scampered back inside. Without my friend\u2019s passport, we had to beg a hotel to accept the photocopy so she could stay with us. We ended up staying in an incredible hotel (the Hotel Splendide Royal), which cost more, but was worth it because they salvaged the rest of our stay in Rome. The passport never turned up, as far as we know. They took down our contact information, but never \u201cgot back to us.\u201d They still got away with charging us one night\u2019s stay because of the cancellation fee. It also took them days to contact the booking company back to authorize our refund (as, I suppose, a final \u201cscrew you\u201d). I ended up spending a lot of money to try and fix this disaster. This was, without a doubt, the WORST hotel I have ever stayed in. Look, if you really want to stay here \u2013 like, if your life depends on it - go ahead.

We spent our first five nights in Italy (2/14/03 - 2/19/03) at the Hotel Mascagni. We thoroughly enjoyed our stay at this fine little hotel. The staff were all very friendly, helpful, professional, and knowledgeable. We had requested a quiet room on an upper floor and received just that. We were on the 6th floor overlooking the dome of a beautiful old church. Our room was small, but comfortable. We had a good bed and adequate storage for our things. The bathroom was immaculate and very well laid out. I really came to appreciate the steam radiator in the bathroom after the second day of walking! Every night I'd draw a steaming hot bath and soak for hours in the very cozy tub listening to the nice sizzle of that radiator (it was freezing temps at night) while I read up on whatever we were going to do the next day. I could have stayed indefinitely at the Mascagni. The complimentary breakfast was the exact same every day, but it was very nice. Eggs (runny one day, to hard the next), cereals, pastries, fresh fruits, good coffee, and juices). We met a variety of people from all over the world, which was very nice (very few Americans). Another bonus about staying at the Mascagni is that it is right around the corner from the Piazza Repubblica and the Metro station. We bought a one week pass and took buses and the metro all over the city, multiple times a day (the pass was $12.40 euros for the week, a bargain!). The station being so close allowed us to travel afar more spontaneously than we would have had it not been so convenient. The only negative was the smoking (and it is why this is a four star instead of five star review), which is a negative about the entire country of Italy evidently. When people in neighboring rooms smoked (and they all did), WE smoked. I have asthma and this really did put a damper on my stay. Evidently the ventilation system ties all of the rooms together even though there are individual thermostats in the rooms. That said, we would definitely stay at the Mascagni when we return to Rome.

The metro is close by, bus stops outside, the train station not far, so we are very glad that we had the opportunity to stay here and would highly recommend.", "Date": "May 23, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Rancho Santa Margarita, California", "Title": "\u201cNice small Hotel\u201d", "Author": "Parris", "ReviewID": "UR108247975", "Content": "My husband and I stayed here for 4 nights during Easter week this year.

I am a 25 year old male, and my girlfriend is 24. I've broken the review down into a few key things. LOCATION The location was fantastic. It's about 5 minutes from Termini station, and only about 2 minutes from the Repubblica metro station (Metro only costs 1 Euro per journey!! BARGAIN!). We easily walked to all of the major sights (with the exception of the Vatican). It's a leisurely 15 mins to Trevi Fountain, 20-25 to the Pantheon, 30-35 to Piazza Navonna. These times are based on when we knew our way, when we were first looking for these places I would probably add another 5-10 minutes onto the above. Also bear in mind we were stopping and looking at things on the way. Everywhere you walk in Rome (at least where we walked) was lovely, so the walking time for us was no issue. ROOM The room was really nice, lovely bathroom, fairly spacious compared to others we looked at online. We only stayed in the standard room which meant there were no tea making facilities, which was a big problem as my girlfriend needs her tea! We asked a few times for hot water (she has her own decaf tea bags) and this seemed to caused huge issues, like it was a bit problem to ask for hot water. The room was also WAY TOO HOT!!! I can't describe how hot it was. It was either a choice between not being able to sleep with the window open because of the traffic noise from outside, or struggle to sleep because it was baking hot in the room. (Worth noting, there is practically no noise from the outside world with the windows closed). The cooling system in the room was about as useful as a chocolate teapot. The beds are very hard, which I am not used to, but it was actually quite comfortable. SERVICE Overall the service was very good, although as above, asking for hot water seemed an issue. One of the porters/concierge guys was a bit scary, and quite intimidating, but everyone else was great. When we arrived we were given a well rehearsed speech about where to go, and were given a map showing all of the main sight seeing locations. BREAKFAST Breakfast was good, as expected really. I just stuck to croissants and jam all week :) OVERALL I have pointed some negatives out above, but these are very minor, and overall the hotel is really nice, the location is great, and the price was good for us.

What a disappointment. We booked this hotel directly through the Hotel Mascagni website. We had high expectations for both the staff and rooms. We normally book with 5 star hotels only, especially in Europe, but the glowing reviews on TripAdvisor made us choose Hotel Mascagni over other hotels in Rome. The only reason why I would recommend this place to anyone is because of its location, but there are so many hotels in the same area that even this is not a good enough reason to stay here. My family of 5 (2 adults, 2 teens, 1 young child) stayed in #406, the family room. We were under the impression that this was a suite, as most \"family rooms\" we've booked in Europe have been. It was actually very small, with space for just one king bed and a sofa bed, practically touching each other. The \"in-room dining area\" is about 18 by 24 inches of a vanity mirror in between the closet space. Once we were situated, we found the room to be dirty. There were toenail clippings on the floor, among other things. The shower is poorly designed. For a \"four star\" hotel and an average of 240 Euros a night, the least we could have asked for was a clean room. Coming from a 5 star in Barcelona, we were quite shocked with the service and the cleanliness of this hotel. Not only were the rooms dirty, but my family was offended by the reception staff. We left for a day trip to Pisa, and one of the staff members asked more than one member of my family if we were leaving without checking out as we were walking out the door. I'm sure they do not ask all of their guests this when they leave for sightseeing. It made us feel uncomfortable, as though they did not trust us to stay at their hotel. When we returned, another staff member rudely asked if we were staying at this hotel, even after having given us the keys to our room. He then proceeded to demand our \"documents\" and proof of our stay from across the room, in front of a full lobby and other hotel guests. We had already been checked in for 3 days, and we had pre-paid in full! Not only is this inconsiderate, but it was embarrassing for my family. We do not understand why we were treated this way. As for the concierge, I've never heard a concierge say \"I don't know\" as they do at Hotel Mascagni. We had dinner where they recommended and did a tour as they recommended; both were poor experiences. In our frustration, we decided to forego the concierge's supposed expertise and had our final dinner in Rome at another hotel nearby-- everyone there, from reception to the servers, was personable and knowledgeable in contrast to those at Hotel Mascagni. We left this hotel with disappointment and regret over our choice for our short stay in Rome. Our experiences here were enough to have a negative impact on our vacation. It is difficult to sleep well and enjoy yourself when you do not feel welcome or secure. As a business owner with TripAdvisor listings, I know the impact one unhappy customer can have on potential business, but this review is not an exaggeration. I hope Hotel Mascagni does not treat all its guests the way they treated my family.

Since I was travelling in March, which is a low season in Italy, hotel was half empty and was selling rooms with nice discount. However the manager at the reception considered his \"honor\" to remind me every morning and evening in exchange for my requests or complaints that i got a perfect price and usually people pay more for this room and used to show me each time what is the usual price. Guys, if u sell at this price - shut up and provide service, and do not complain u sold it for less! First morning - around 11 am I was in my room when a cleaning lady without any knocking simply entered my room!!! I have never seen that at any hotel, even 3 star, in any country of the world! I left at around 11.30 am, but when I came back around 7 - my room was still not cleaned! when i complained - the manager said that I was in my room and they could not clean!!! though he saw me leaving at 11.30!!! Then, wi-fi and computer use were indicated as free at the hotel. When I asked for login and pass to access, the reception issued me the login and pass, yet the price was indicated as 15 euro. They did not charge me, but the traditional phrase from manager \"you pay lower price than usual and your internet is still free!\" was of course included into our conversation. Also first day I was a bit surprised to see 2 twin beds in my room as I put a request for one king size bed. The guy who hepled me with the suitcases asked to wait one minute for him to go to reception and check what he could do. Well, that minute was 30 minutes - because I left in 30 minutes and the guy still did not show up!!!! The blankets in the room were dirty, and I merely enjoyed some previous guests' hair on them!!! Fantastic about this hotel were also the construction works that they started every morning at 9 am BUT finished at 11-12 in the morning... Considering that in Italy you only go out in the vening around 9 pm - and come back not earlier than 12 or 1 oclock, and respectively want to have some rest in the morning - it was unbearable to wake up to this noise!!!!! The rooms overlooking the street are especially the ones to avoid - there's a road leading to the square and it gets extremely noisy already at 7 am, and windows hide nothing of this noise. I can go on for dozens of more \"details\" like above, but to cut it short - there are much nicer hotels for better money in Rome, and being located close to the Termini station and metro is in no way the compensation for one of the worst services I experienced in my life.", "Date": "March 8, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "London, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cCharming, affordable hotel recommended for sightseers\u201d", "Author": "MrR0bin", "ReviewID": "UR57713036", "Content": "Our stay at Hotel Mascagni was very pleasant and enjoyable.

The location is close to the train station (great!) and is mid-distance from many of Rome's sites. My friend and I walked to everything... but a couple of the sites will require you to walk 45 minutes or more. The Colliseum (10-15 minutes walk) is the closest site to the hotel followed by the Pantheon area (20-25 minutes walk); If you're not a big walker, you will want to take a taxi or bus to some of the locations (for those who only want to walk 10 to 15 minutes everywhere try finding a hotel near the Panetheon (that seems pretty centrally located). The hotel's lobby is not going to wow you (it's tiny compared to other hotels its size) and has no restaurant -- while there is a bar on the second floor, I only saw some hotel employees spending time there. Breakfast (also on the second floor) was the best we had while in Italy and included hard-boiled eggs, scrambled eggs, salami, ham, yogurt, granola, cereal, fresh fruit, pastries and -- we counted -- about 40+ items to choose from. The staff was friendly and immeditately asked whether we wanted cappuccino or coffee or tea. We got 15% off of the rooms for visiting during the off-season and then we got an upgrade to what I hear is their nicest room (601) for 20 Euros (normally 40 euros) (so we payed 120 Euros per night for four nights in what I believe is their best room (I overheard someone on staff say that)). The room 601 was in the back of the top floor overlooking some other buildings and a cool dome-like structure -- it was very quiet. Our room had a couch area (nice). The bathroom shower has one of those partial swivel-glass doors that seems common in Italy and so water would get on the floor (but this seems common in Italy (at least on our trip)). My only complaint about the room was that it was a bit warm and had a very slight smell of a smoker (the smell of smoke was closer to the room's front door and so it didn't bother us in bed)...we ended up sleeping with the windows open because we couldn't figure out how to get the air conditioning to work. Wi-Fi access is available in the rooms (though it was spotty) and also on the second floor. If you don't have a computer, they have two nice iMacs on the second floor. There are a couple of decent restaurants near the hotel but I recommend you venture out to other neighborhoods to find as good food at cheaper prices. The thing that put my review over the top (to 5 stars) was when the front desk guy got us a private taxi to take us to a very early flight and he packed us a to-go breakfast bag of yogurts, fruit, breads, 2 hard boiled eggs and more -- that was a really nice send-off.

If nothing else their reception desk people are great. Luciano's smile is always shining and he is eager to help with whatever you need. Here my positive experience with this hotel kinda stops. I call this a 'shoe box hotel' because this is how I felt being there. All spaces are so small, you sometimes need to lean against a wall to let another person pass by. Room is actually fine, but nothing special to write home about. The other reviewers are right - the bed is stiff. Worse, though, (for me) was that the pillow was very thin. Bathroom is very small. The worst about the bathroom is the shower. I already said once in my reviews that a proper working shower for me is half victory for the hotel. The shower in my room was a shock therapy. I can't figure out why, but the temperature of the water goes in a cycle from very hot to refreshingly cold. I figured out this cycle and dived in at moments when the temperature was tolerable. We reported this to the staff and in the evening the water flow was stronger, however the temperature cycle remained there. On top of that because the bathroom is small, they tried to fit everything in there, so after you take a shower, your whole bathroom is completely soaked (and I am talking about a 5min shower - you cannot take more than that with this shock therapy). Gladly they have an adequate supply of towels to throw on the floor. Other issues are: - wifi does not work properly in the hotel. There is only one spot where you can get a fair signal. They don't charge for wifi because of the signal issue. I was warned that the signal can go off any moment, but then it would come back. - breakfast is simply poor. The selection of cold cuts was shrinking by day. In our first breakfast they had mortadella, pancetta, turkey ham and cheese. On the second day mortadella was missing. On the third day pancetta disappeared. So we went outside for a breakfast because the choice was really bad. Always cold cooked eggs, cheap orange juice concentrate (very sweet), train-quality coffee... the bottom line - they should work on breakfast. Charge me more, but give me a good selection and fair Italian quality. Here is an example that gives good description: on the second day I saw a waiter standing over a bowl of cereal flakes with a spoon and he was going through the flakes as if looking for something. I wouldn't eat cereal in this hotel. Good - location. Although I'd prefer to be closer to piazza venezia, but I admit the room prices most likely are steeper there. You can pretty much walk to most great places in Rome (aside from Trastevere, perhaps). Bottom line - if you have a good deal (eur 100-150/night), perhaps it's a good compromise (after all most go to Rome to walk the streets and not sit in a hotel room). But if you are paying EUR200 and more, find yourself another hotel.

There are a high number of incidents in Rome.) Something that I really liked about this place was the day I checked out. I had an early flight, so I checked out at about 3:40 am. On my way out, the guy behind the desk gave me his breakfast. I could tell it was his because he had it already wrapped up in a bag for when his shift would end. Now I didn't plan on taking it, but he insisted. It was very nice of him to do so, so I did. But that stuck out in my mind the kind of generosity and customer satisfaction the staff brings. Another thing I wanted to mention is that I didn't book any tours through the hotel (largely due to the fact that family and friends warned me that booking tours through hotels in Rome can cost you -- meaning that the hotel pockets your money and if they set up the tour, you still have to pay for it.) I did, however, find the same company my hotel books the tours with at the train station behind terminal 23. I booked my tours from there, but they still picked me up at the hotel.

The first thing we found out from the man at Reception was that \"there has been a big problem\". We were then told that we would have to stay at another hotel as the Mascagni was fully booked. No one from Expedia or Hotel Mascagni thought it would be a good idea to let us know about this. We asked to see the manager to work it out. No. The manager was unavailable. We reconsidered as we now just wanted to get on and enjoy our holiday. We asked to use their internet connection to double check the hotel that they were recommending. No. The internet connection was broken (later, the story changed and the passwords to use the internet were locked in the managers office and he didn't have the key ... ). We found our whole experience talking to the man at reception to be very frustrating. He was rude to say the least. Rudeness defined in this case as being an unwillingness to listen to (and to talk over) anything we had to say; an unwillingness to put us in contact with the manager; and an unwillingness even to apologise. He even seemed to joke about it when phoning the other back-up hotel. Excellent. The last thing you want to have to deal with having just landed. When we expressed our displeasure at what had happened. He told us to go away for about two hours and he was sure he could \"sort everything out\" to our satisfaction. How he was going to do this? I have no clue (either you are fully booked or you are not). Also, he said that the manager would be back by then. We went away based on hope. Though it was difficult to enjoy Rome with the uncertainty of what was going on in mind. Not least, this disrupted our itinerary as we did not plan to come back to the hotel until the evening. So, we came back two hours later. Had the problem been solved? No. Was the manager contactable now? No (and never had been throughout the whole trip). This struck of a lack of professionalism. Why make a problem worse by interrupting our day? Just be honest. We then took the risk (really there was no option) and went to other hotel as suggested. It was a clean hotel, but definitely more of a business setting. So, our romantic holiday in Rome was turned into a business trip. Furthermore, the \"upgraded room\" they gave us was facing one of the busiest shopping roads in Rome (Via del Tritone). Very noisy, loads of traffic. On the second floor, the hotels so-called \"sound-proofing\" was next to useless. Given that there were heavy buses stopping at a bus stop outside, we were treated the revving-up/slowing-down of buses late into the night and early in the morning. Peaceful and romantic this was not. Their breakfast left much to be desired. Very dry chocolate croissants, hard bread, and crunchy toast were definitely not the order of the day. So, to conclude, we enjoyed Rome, but regret choosing the Mascagni Hotel. Their organisation appears to be all over the place.

It took us about 45 minutes walking to get to any of the sights or to areas where we wanted to be. But we found many hotels on charming streets in charming (but busy) areas from which you could reach almost any of the sights within 10 minutes by foot. Many great restaurants to choose from, but not near the Mascagni. Hotel Mascagni staff sent us to an area frequented by only tourists, and the higher-than-normal prices reflected the clientele. Just check a map, find the train station and ask yourself whether you want to be there. The charm of Italy is not in or near the train station.

The rooms are a bit larger than what you would expect in Europe. Great location for getting around Rome. Many things are within walking distance.

The members of staff were really friendly and helpfull, what I like about the hotel is that it had class with the touch of the old. The hotel was really clean and the breafast was nice and fresh. The location of the hotel is great, it's within Walking distance from everything you need to see and from the airport you can catch a train which takes about 30 mintues and then the walk to the hotel is about 10 mintues.

However, the staff was very gracious and put us up at a sister hotel (Hotel Beverly Hills) for the first night and moved us back for the other two nights. The room was a nice size and was quiet as it faced the back of the hotel. Special kudos to the concierge staff, especially Luciano, who was extremely helpful when extra care was needed. His recommendation for a restaurant (Tre Moschettieri) was excellent.
