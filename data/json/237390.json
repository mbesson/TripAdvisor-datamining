I think we paid \u00c2\u00a380-85 for our room. Location is really excellent - very central, being in the San Marco section of Venice. Room was much better than we expected. Very nice comfy bed in a smallish room (but fine for us backpackers). Room was nicely decorated with a thick shag brown carpet and high ceiling. Bathroom was fine though shower cubicle was very small (and I'm not a fatty). Breakfast was remarkable for the bad as well as the good. I don't recall ever having such vile coffee, but the small croissants were unlimited (I limited myself to 5), and there was a nice selection of yoghurts (I had two) and some fairly cheapish cheese and ham (I also had some of this). The orange juice I could have sworn had been watered down. Such a large breakfast meant not having to stop for a \u00e2\u201a\u00ac20 snack prior to lunch - well worth keeping in mind if you find the prices (more expensive than Zurich or Lichtenstein) somewhat heart-stopping. I could hear someone snoring from another room, which was quite bizarre, as aside from that I heard no other noises. Staff were very Italian and very friendly, though one of the receptionists (there were two when we walked in) had a black eye. I asked if they'd had a falling out. He said 'no'. One other point - given that every time I stay in a hotel I see a number of guests (including us too usually) wanting to leave their bags prior to check-in or after check-out, I find it incredible that most hotels (including this one) have such an insecure service for this. Yes, they had room for bags to be left, but the total lack of any security for them would have left me quite nervous had I had anything of any value left behind (eg Murano glassware - btw, Murano's even better than Venice). And another security point - why did we have to leave our keys with the reception every time we went out if all we had to do was say our room number in order to have our keys returned to us? What sort of security is this? At least ask for the name under which our room is booked. Regardless, I'm still giving a score of 5 owing to the location, price and fact that the hotel is actually rather nice.", "Date": "April 8, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "East London, South Africa", "Title": "\u201cCentral and good value for money\u201d", "Author": "AliS82", "ReviewID": "UR126639448", "Content": "We had a bit of a battle finding the place, but I think that was more a case of the language barrier, fatigue and not preparing properly.

Very central!!! Overlooking the canal where you can hear the gondoliers singing. Things to note are that it is closer and simpler to get to from the Rialto vaporetto stop. We made the mistake of getting off at Zattere and took an hour to reach the hotel as we got lost in the alleyways. We had the deluxe room, which was large and beautifully done. The bathroom was small, but that is true for anywhere you go in Italy:) But it served the purpose. We paid 120 euros a night in the peak season i.e. July,2011. Breakfast was included. Breakfast was rather nice with cold cuts eggs to order the works. It was not like an American buffet, but served a lot more than regular continental breakfast served at hotels generally all over Italy. The breakfast room was also quite nice overlooking the canal. The negatives - We reached there around 9:30-10am, and has requested for an early check in but once there they refused to let us check in till 2pm. They promised us a canal facing room but did not give us one. The staff was not helpful. They spoke some English but did not seem willing to help with anything. (directions, food recommendations etc.) Fortunately they let us leave our luggage at the hotel till 2pm. We were in Venice only for a night and decided we did not want to ruin our moods as the hotel itself was nice. Would definitely recommend it . But the staff at the reception really needs to be little more customer service oriented. In fact we saw this in all the hotels we stayed in Italy - Rome, Naples, Venice - customer service is really missing at the reception. They are just not bothered. But Venice itself is soo gorgeous that it helps you forget all the negatives. Its a city to get lost in.

A modern bath that even had a towel warmer (where can I get one of those??). The staff was extremely helpful, giving patient directions to lost travellers! San Marco is a five minute walk, as is the Rialto Bridge shopping area. Location couldn't be much better, although our room windows opened onto the alley off the front door - so we had no view.

The Hotel is perfectly situated along a smaller side-canal from the grand canal. The easiest way to get there from the Marco Polo airport is to take the orange Vaporetto line and get off at the Rialto, if you know the way it takes about 45 seconds to get to the Centauro Hotel from the drop point. The hotel itself was very easy to find, we just went into the alley right next to the bank that is located next to the Manin statue. We lived on the top floor (third) and had no issues with either noise, bugs or heat/cold. The room had air conditioning and an electronic bug zapper (which we never needed). The TV is quite small and the only english speaking channel is CNN. From our room we could see the two bridges of campo Manin and the Rio Ter\u00c3\u00a0 degli Assassini street and from our windows we could also hear the somewhat cheezy singing of the gondoliers. From the hotel you have the Rialto, grand canal, San Marco's square, Accademia, Fenice and the Guggenheim very close by, it is in a sense the perfect location without being too crowded. The staff (which were made up of about 6 people during the 4 nights we stayed there) are all very friendly and helpful. Although when we asked about ATMs we were misunderstood and told that there were non to be found in all of Venice! (don't worry there are about 10 just around the corner). The map of Venice supplied by the staff is nothing I would recommend, it lacks all sorts of details and will get you lost in a hurry. It's preferable to buy a proper map of the city for a few Euros in one of the tourist stalls. The Hotel does not provide any internet or computer services, the only real drawback of the hotel together with not offering any room service. The majority of the guests seemed to be french and in older than 50 but there were the odd younger couple aswell, as a consequence the hotel is very quite, even during the morning breakfast rush hours. The breakfast was nice, you get yoghurt, a pick of different marmelades, butter, cheese, ham, rolls, croissants, grapefruit and orange juice, serial, fruit and so on and the breakfast staff will make you any coffee you'd like. Everything is clean and tastes great. The room itself was a little on the small side, but considering it's a 14th century building you'll manage. If you have trouble using stairs though, the Hotel is rendered useless (along with the rest of Venice for that matter) and getting to the third floor with 40 kg of luggage can be quite a challenge for someone who isn't fit. The hotel is also fitted with smoke detectors and escape routes located by your hotel door. Our room had a mini fridge and it's content was quite cheap for once. If you emptied it you wouldn't have spent much more than 10 Euros by my estimate. On the last day we stored our bags behind the clerks desk without any issues.

It was the perfect place from which to enjoy all that lovely Venice has to offer. The rooms were small (this is, after all, Europe) but had high (at least 10 feet-high) ceilings with exposed wooden beams -- a very nice touch. The attendants speak good English and were very helpful, both before and during our stay, with directions and restaurant reservations. We had a very pleasant stay. Unfortunately, check-in was a disaster. Although we had corresponded by e-mail and telephone after we made our reservation, they'd managed to lose our reservation by the time we arrived. Thank God (and Rick Steves) that I brought a print-out of the confirmation e-mail; otherwise, we might've ended up sleeping in Piazza San Marco! Seeing that we did indeed have a reservation, the agent scrambled to accommodate us. He said the hotel was full but they had a suite of rooms in another building where we could stay. This was worrisome because we had had a nightmarish ordeal in Rome several years ago that began this same way. With the assistance of an incredibly nice bellman, I lugged our stuff the few blocks to the other building. As promised, the rooms in the other building, though isolated from the hotel, were in fact nicer than the rooms in the hotel. Our check-in ordeal, however, was not yet over. Right as we began to unpack and my wife prepared to take a shower, there was a knock on our door: apparently, we were to stay in the hotel after all, not this building. Stunned, we gathered our belongings and made the trek back to the hotel, where we were taken upstairs to the room we had booked in the first place. Needless to say, this ordeal was not welcome after the long transatlantic flight. That said, once we were (finally) checked in, we had a great stay. The room was excellent, and the staff very helpful. I'm guessing this comedy of errors was atypical of this hotel, and it wasn't reflective of the high level of service we received before our arrival and after we were finally checked into our room.

I did not accept the alternative hotel, grumbled a bit to the management, and they put us in one of their best rooms in the end.

Contact the hotel directly for good rates. A phone call might get the best results, but email is good too. Hotel Centauro saved our trip to Venice! Unwittingly, we booked a room at a \"hotel\" that was really guest rooms in someone's house. The owner had taken in a family of 4 w/o reservation before we arrived and gave them our 3 person room since they were a 4 person family. We were not happy being mushed into a tiny 1 person room with 3 twin beds and no room to walk - we had to stash our luggage under the beds! This hotel was just around the corner and had a room available. Andrea was very friendly and gave us the same rate we were paying at this other person's guest room w/o breakfast. Sadly, Andrea was the only nice and helpful staff we encountered. I can only give the hotel 4 stars because of his unfriendly co-workers who seemed suspicious of us, possibly because we were Americans who arrived with no reservation. Most of the hotel's clients seemed to be European families. While it is true there is no elevator/lift, it is probably because the Centauro is located in a historic building in Venice and obtaining a building permit for them would be a nightmare. If you are fit enough to bring your luggage all the way from the train station and again from the main canal through the Venetian calles to the hotel, than you can probably manage carrying the lugguge up the stairs and through the halls (it is not a big hotel). The hotel itself is just as it appears on their website - small and elegant with marbled floors, stairs, and counters. The breakfast room was welcoming with a beautiful view of the canaletto the hotel is on. Beverage service is provided (they even will make cafe americano if you ask) and we found a nice selection of cereals, croissants, yogurt, meats and cheeses, some fruit, and even hard boiled eggs. We had to change rooms once during our stay because we came without reservations. Our first room had a marvelous view of the canal with passing gondoliers en canto, the second had a view of a fine Venetian wall complete with pigeon staring at us. The benefit of the second room is the absence of gondolier singing in the evening as you try to go to sleep. The rooms were both nicely decorated in Venetian style with a chandelier to make you feel elegant in your surroundings. The bathrooms were modern and very clean. A warning: while on the second floor we opened the window to enjoy the sounds of passing gondoliers in the early evening and a mosquito got in the room. The rest of the night we kept waking up from it buzzing in our ears, but we could not find the darn thing. We liked the hotel enought that I booked my family there on a visit to Venice the next summer and we had no complaints except that the staff is not very friendly. also, thier friends called the hotel directly and were able to get a suite with canal view for less than my aunt's double room which was suppose to have a view of the canal, but did not have a full view.", "Date": "September 21, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Southampton, UK", "Title": "\u201cGood choice\u201d", "Author": "portos", "ReviewID": "UR5475801", "Content": "We stayed in the hotel at the end of June 2006. Our room was on the second floor (third level). The absence of the lift was a bit irritating, since the stairs are steep. On the bright sight the location of the hotel is excellent, staff is very helpful, and it is very reasonably priced. The room and the bathroom were very clean, breakfast was good as well. Make sure you come to the breakfast room earlier rather than later, since the choice of food reduces with time.", "Date": "July 17, 2006"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Centauro Hotel", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g187870-d237390-Reviews-Centauro_Hotel-Venice_Veneto.html", "Price": "$106 - $360*", "Address": "<address class=\"addressReset\"><span rel=\"v:address\"><span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">S.Marco, Campo Daniele Manin, 4297/A</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:postal-code\">30124</span> <span property=\"v:locality\">Venice</span></span>, <span class=\"country-name\" property=\"v:country-name\">Italy</span> </span></span></address>", "HotelID": "237390", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/ProviderThumbnails/dirs/c1/6d/c16d0952382f591b05d481b2f152ccfb1large.jpg"}}
