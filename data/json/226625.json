We have stayed in various hotels - but we were happy to return to it. Our choices are made very much by price and also by using these reviews, so we're aware of the importance of being honest and impartial. This hotel was excellent value for money. The service afforded by all staff in this hotel, was by far of a level one would expect from a hotel costing far more, yet it was so personal and in no way was it contrived. We had booked a standard double, but on checking in we were surprised to be offerred a free upgrade to a superior room, situated in a new area of the building. This is an annex, and, although we thought it a bit odd, initially, that we had to go out of the main hotel and two doors down, this feeling left us immediately, when we were taken into a beautiful bright room, spotlessly clean, and although overlooking the road called Via Boncompagni - which is the fairly busy road leading onto the Via Veneto, you could barely hear a thing - being quite high up, but also due to the quality of the window glass. Breakfast was taken in the main hotel on the 7th floor in a roof terrace conservatory - affording amazing views over the city - even as far as the Vatican on the clearer day. A substantial spread was offerred the usual continental style - fresh rolls, meats, cheese, jams, cake, etc, and there were endless fresh cappucino's and espressos made to order. Having made our own way to the hotel by train and taxi from the airport, we discovered that it would have been cheaper to let the hotel organise our transfer. The gentleman on the desk (Gianni) ordered us a taxi which arrived ten minutes later and was sure to remind us to check the fixed price before travelling and also ensured we knew the name of the firm providing the taxi, thus ensuring that his clients were correctly taken care of. It's little things like this that stay in your mind. We will definately use this hotel again, next year when we make our annual trip. Thank you to all the staff who made it so comfortable and pleasant.", "Date": "April 20, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Larisa", "Title": "\u201cGood Location\u201d", "Author": "Ioannis C Posted by an Easytobook.com traveler", "ReviewID": "UR127916527", "Content": "Small room but every day was cleaned .

Our flight was in at 10.30 am, booked Romecabs for transfer. Driver was waiting as promised at the \"orange meeting point\". She was holding folder with my name on it. Confirmed name and destination. Had very little english which was fine as I am not much of a small talker anyway. Took us to the hotel and pointed out a few sites on the way. Took just under an hour to get there (from Da Vinci FCO). As we were too early for check in, the staff of the hotel advised room would not be ready for a while which we understood. He gave us a map of the area and took our bags for safekeeping. Afraid my map skills are as good as my talking skills ...... headed in a direction that I hoped would bring me to a main street, eventually it did. Hotel is not central as advised on web sites. You will WALK A LOT to see all. Headed for what I would call a square and saw many open top buses. Took one of these (think the bus chain was called stop 110) as thought this would be the best way of getting my bearings. The charge for the tour was E18 but the ticket was good for 48 hrs. Headphones were also provided. There are different lanuages spoken so you need to select the correct language (4 for english). Full tour lasted about 2 hrs and you can hop on and hop off if you wish. I stayed on to see all the sites, so next day I could walk to them. Got back to hotel, room was ready. Asked for the state tax amount immediately (E3 per person per day of stay - ie. 2 people staying for 3 days = E18). Advised to go ahead and our bags would be dropped up. This was done immediately. The young man also showed us how to work the a/c. The room was very small and the decor would probably be considered old fashioned but it served its purpose. The staff were friendly any time we meet any. Room was cleaned every day, clean towels provided, very good shower (again small but powerful). Breakfast was in another hotel connected by steps (could not use the elevator in Veneto for breakfast room) - no big deal just had to go to reception from your floor go down a few steps climb a few steps and get another elevator - in was on the roof top (covered by glass), beautiful views, it was served from 7 to 10 - cold meats, cheese, bread, rolls, juices, yogurts, croissants, jams, cakes, tea & coffee available, again sufficient to keep you going for a few hours. The shops are divane, there were sales on 50-70% off, I recommend bringing an empty bag for check in, you will shop till you drop. Food and drink are expensive there. In restaurants, there is a service charge added onto the bill, think this was 21%, it is then up to you whether or not you want to tip. Good english by most of the waiters. Sights are fabulous, well worth the visit. To sum up - tips - bring comfortable walking shoes - you will do a lot of walking bring plenty money - you will shop a lot", "Date": "February 17, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Toronto, Canada", "Title": "\u201cGreat value and location\u201d", "Author": "Toronto_JF", "ReviewID": "UR123835991", "Content": "Walking distance to many of the must see attractions.

Despite recent renovations, there were still small chunks of plaster off the wall and raw plugs visible so a little TLC is needed to keep it up to standard. Breakfast was through in the adjoining hotel Romantica up on the 7th floor so the views were excellent. During the warmer months, I guess they open up the terrace which I'm sure is a great advantage. We found the breakfast to be more than adequate (for Europe) but suggest you get them to make your coffee to order (capuccino/expresso) rather than take the ready made stuff. It was a little away from the main attractions so we opted to stay out all day and only return later at night.

However i can say that this is an average hotel with good location and very good service from the staff. Room was a little bit small but very clean..you can smell it!! The housekeeping department did a great job! Every day they changed our towels and linen...Bathroom updated and carefully cleaned. Our shower had a jacuzzi which we enjoyed much! Our room didn't have a view (interior room) but we didn't really care as when you are in Rome you will be for sure all day out for sight-seeing! This hotel from the web site looks a bit better but that's ok...not very disappointing.. Breakfast was ok...not someting special, no hot dishes like eggs bacon etc...but they offer also capuccino for free...I am sure that (after so many days of checking availability & rates through internet for hotels in Rome) I made the best choice...and this because I had a tight budget (max 85-90 euro per night B/B-which for Rome hotels believe me is little money) and I wanted a centrally located hotel so we can do everything on foot. However almost outside of the hotel there is a bus stop which you can use to be transfered in many areas in Rome. Hotel Veneto has a sister Hotel just next door (at the corner) called Romanico Hotel also 4 star but looked much better and glamorous (and more expensive)! They share the bar and the SPA area. In Romanico hotel breakfast is served on the roof top, better area than the breakfast hall of Veneto Hotel. Hotel is located approximately 3 quarters from Via Veneto and about 7 minutes walking distance from metro Barberini and 10-15 minutes from Piazza Di Spagna. We enjoyed the tour of Rome all on foot!!! Quite tiring but enjoyable too!! Be careful! Colosseo, Roman forum and Paltino close at 15.30!! But they issue a ticket for you (12 euro) valid for 2 days.

The hotel is located in a relatively convenient location however all the major sites are at least 45 minutes away by foot and the transport system in Rome is quite poor. This may not be too much of a problem in the cooler months but when the weather is hot ( most of the year) this is quite far. I found all the staff, apart from one lady at reception, to be abrupt and disinterested. On arrival, we were waiting for several minutes while they located out reservation (made by our travel agent) and were told that we had to pay \u20ac25 in cash immediately due to a taw by the city of Rome. This and the price of all the extras (WiFi \u20ac5 per hour) left a rather bitter taste in our mouth.

We then walked in to the already occupied room on two rather shocked people who had been asleep in bed. No apology was offered (to us or the poor shocked people in the room) and it was seen as not a problem. It was also very hot while we were there and the air con in the room was quite ineffective. We had been told not to put the temperature below 18 degrees otherwise it would stop working. We did so and found that the room we more like 25 degrees. Unable to make it any cooler. There was also quite a serious leak in the bathroom, and following a five minute shower was protruding into the bedroom. We had to use all but one of our towels to stop it from covering the room. Staff did not respond to this problem in any way. We had paid for breakfast which was alright, but there was no fruit and the coffee was poor. I had just come from a three and a half star hotel in Paris following a very enjoyable stay. It was really very disappointing to come to this hotel, pay more and have such a negative experience. I travel quite frequently and have never left a negative review about a hotel before but this hotel was really very disappointing and I felt that we were charged for things that should come as standard, particularly in a four star hotel.

When we arrived we were told that room in the main hotel will be available next day and meanwhile we were given room in the next door building. It meant we were unable to unpack. It wasn't very big deal as we came only for two nights, but still a little bit inconvenient. As we booked only room without the breakfast, we were given as the compensation for the inconvenience, two free breakfasts on the roof terrace. The next day we arrived at the reception early in the morning to check in in to the other room. We were under the impression that we will be given the room straight away. Unfortunately room was not ready until 14.00, so we left the luggage with the porter and went sightseeing. We were offered two complimentary welcome drinks in the bar, which we happily ordered after the whole day walking. As we stayed one night in the room next door to the hotel and one night in the main hotel, I can do some comparing. Both rooms were the same size, quite small but big enough if you do not plan to stay the whole day in the room. I have to admit that both were very clean, and I am a clean freak. We had good size and very comfortable bed in the first room, unfortunately I cannot say the same thing about the second room. Bed was smaller and as I turned over the whole bed always moved a bit as it was on wheels. Decor of the both rooms was not up to my taste at all, but it is a personal thing. Furniture was gold and with over the top decorations. A/C worked perfectly in both rooms, which was very important as the weather was too hot. We had a shower door missing in the main hotel room. There was only the door frame left were used to be a shower door, so it was replaced by the simple shower curtain. Showers were very powerful and fancy in both rooms, even had a shower jets for a massage. Unfortunately we were unable to use it in the second room. As soon as we turned it on, it blew the curtain away and whole bathroom got flooded. I am an average person and showers were too small to even turn around. There was also a make up mirror hanging of the wall with the electric wire exposed and broken floor lamp. For all these little details I just mentioned I would not give a four stars to this hotel. On the positive note: hotel was very quite and we did not experience any noise in the corridors or other rooms. Breakfast was really tasty, buffet style, enough choice. Fruit, yoghurts, cereals, ham, salami, cheese, vegetables, even selection of cakes. Great start of the day on the roof terrace. All hotel staff was really helpful and polite.

While it is in a fairly central part of Rome, it is not nearly as central to many of the tourist sites as it looks on the map. I don't mind walking, but it was often pretty long walks to get anywhere, and there's barely a subway in the old part of Rome. During the summer months, this might be a great location. For one thing, it is very close to the park, so if you want to run, etc. you are in a great spot. Also, in the summer, walking 35 minutes to get to places like Piazza Navona isn't a big deal at all. During the winter, it is a bigger deal because of the rain, etc. Also, during the summer being away from the worst of the crowds might be a nice thing. Overall, though, the Via Veneto hasn't been the place to be since the 1970s. Rooms are nicely decorated. They are a small though, even by European standards (the smallest we saw in all of Italy). The walls to the hallway are very thin, meaning that hallway noise comes into your room unfortunately. Breakfast was good. They have a great espresso bar where they can make you cappuccinos etc. too and a pretty good selection of fruits and pastries. Unfortunately they charge you quite a bit to even get poorly made eggs. The view from the breakfast room is quite nice. If you are interested in wireless, you'll probably be disappointed to see how much they charge. Everywhere else in Italy had either free wireless or very cheap wireless. It was enough at Hotel Veneto that it wasn't worth paying for.

We were met at the airport by a very pleasant driver who pointed out various landmarks on the way to the hotel. The staff were all very friendly and helpful during our time there, exceptionally efficient and very smartly turned out. They were all a credit to the hotel. The room was decorated in a flambouyant way but we loved it. The bed was very comfortable and the room was pristine in its cleanliness. The only complaint we would have was that we could only get CNN as an English TV station so missed the news morning and night - BBC news would have been better for us but that's just us being picky as you don't come to Rome to watch telly after all. Breakfast was fantastic with a great selection of cereals, meats, cheeses, bread buns, fruit, yoghurt, cakes and pastries. Never ending supply of tea/coffee/juice/water and staff would make you a cappucino, latte or whatever if you asked - it was no problem. The staff kept all the food and drink topped up and tables were cleared efficiently. We paid to go up to have breakfast on the roof top terrace one day - 5 euros extra but well worth it on a nice day. We found a nice restaurant 'Il Pomidorino' a short distance away where the staff were again great and the food was very pleasant - fills with locals which I always take as a good sign. It wasn't cheap but was certainly reasonable for Rome and the steak and other meats were good portions. I can also recommend 'Lotti' for ice-cream and cakes on via Sardagna nearby. The hotel's location was very good and a short walk to the Spanish Steps, Trevi Fountain and such like. The Coliseum etc,etc are also within walking distance. I have bad joints and managed to stroll everywhere. Rome is a very, very expensive city - \u00a34/\u00a35 for a tea or coffee is standard and a basic pasta lunch of 2 dishes with 2 drinks like coke or water doesn't leave you any change from \u00a325. It was certainly a lot more expensive than when I had been before, although some of that will be due to the pound/euro rate.

When making our reservation through last minute, two free tickets to the colosseum were advertised. However on arrival staff told us this was only when a delux room was booked which was not made clear on the advert. This was also brought up by another customer at reception before us. After complaining about this the hotel staff offered to upgrade our room as a gesture of goodwill and offered us two complimentary drinks. However when we arrived in our room it did not look anything like the pictures advertised on the website. The room was tiny with a small window and a view that consisted of 3 outside walls. If ours was a delux a room I dread to think what a standard room was like. The 'double' bed was made up of two single beds pushed together and the bathroom was like a closet. When we also claimed our free drinks we were overcharged for others we purchased. After ordering three glasses of wine and a glass of amaretto the total bill came to 28 euros. When we produced our free drinks card the waiter minused 10 euros for two glasses of wine which meant that one glass of wine and a glass of amaretto came to 18 euros. If one glass of wine is 5 euros then thats the most expensive amaretto drink I have ever had in my life! complete rip off. The reception staff were unfriendly and unhelpful, not once did they make me feel like a valued guest. From their responses to other negative reviews I can also see that it appears that the guest always appears to be at fault which from my experience I can probably guess that is not the case. The only positives were the hotels cleanliness and one of the porters managed a smile whilst we were there.

The staff on the front desk weren't rude or stand-offish, but they weren't particularly friendly either (perhaps because of the strong smell in the reception area, where the was an over-enthusiastic amount of fragranced oil in a display). The waiting staff in the breakfast room were very pleasant, and the food itself was great (tip - ask for an espresso rather than drink the coffee available in the self-dispenser). All in all, the hotel was disappointing value for money. I wouldn't go back - having compromised location in favour of what I thought would be better value for money, I feel we were let down.

It Is located in what seemed to be the financial district, however close to via veneto... lots of modern/chic bars and restaurants. The hotel is currently undergoing renovation work, but it didn't interfere with our stay. Nice interior of the hotel, very clean and evidently been recently improved. Concierge are very helpful in bringing luggage up to your room. The room we stayed in was a double deluxe bedroom (no 307) with jacuzzi bath and massage shower... don't be fooled into thinking you will have a big bathroom, it was very small and they have fitted too much into a tight room! Bath was just about big enough to fit one, but even that was a squeeze. Fixtures and fittings are luxurious, just a shame that there was the odd unfinished final touches that would have made it perfect (e.g. Towel rail plumbing fitted, minus the actual heated towel rail.) The bedroom -It had lovely marble floors and the features were typically Italian... very romantic! we were told it was a king-size bed... yeah pehaps in size, but two single beds put together and dressed like a king-size bed. Decor comprised of golds, creams and reds... very warm and cosy feel. Mini bar reasonably priced, and in room safe was a good feature. One downside to the bedrooms are that you can hear a little too much of your guests next door, above and below, walls are paper thin! Services - Mmmm..... room service - not strictly true, unless you are only thirsty and fancy a drink from the menu! Breakfast room is not as advertised on websites on top floor with panoramic views of rome, due to renovation we had to use a room on ground floor witch was a little disappointing, but i'm sure when renovations are over breakfast would be back on seventh floor. One last piece of advice... Don't take the hotels offer upon a private car from airport for 60 euros, white taxi cabs only cost a fixed price of 30 euros from airport into anywhere in centre of rome. We made the mistake of this for convenience, however the driver only knew our name and not the hotel we were staying at, so as you can imagine... the non english speaking driver and the not so good speaking italian passangers made for an interesting trip!

Also available were Italian TV, French and German. For breakfast we had to go to the breakfas room which was on the top floor of the hotel. For reading previous reviews and the hotels description, we had been informed that breakfast (during the summer months) was served on the hotels rooftop terrace, so when we discovered that the rooftop terrace was not open and was instead full of old outdoor furniture was a surpirse! We had been looking forward to eating outside in the heat but this never happend. There was no explination as to why this was closed or anything from the staff. The breakfast in the indoor room was average. Tea, coffee, fruit juice, ceral, bread, pastries. Nothing was available which was hot. Its a small room and a tight squeeze. The tea and coffee are not out of a macine, but are out of jugs which the staff have to continually change as when we went up, were mostly cold or there was not hot water/cofee/milk remaining. We just ate and go out as quickly as we could. Its an avarage hotel in a avarage location. Anyone visiting Rome should know that there is alot of walking and in the summer the heat can be un-bearable! The hotel did its purpose and was somewhee to sleep.

Thankfully we spent most of our time out enjoying Rome so it wasn't a complete spoiler. The location of the hotel was pretty good and within walking distance to central Rome. Metro and bus services also nice and handy. Around Via Veneto is very attractive place filled mainly with Bank offices and swanky restaurants close by. It was very quiet at night, and we felt fairly safe walking along the street. Firstly the good points of the hotel: The hotel staff were very helpful checking us in and handling our baggage when we arrived late after our flight. The free map was very useful. Room sizes are fairly generous. Good size bed. Our standard double room had a 6' bed. The roof terrace looks great (if it were open during our stay). I should point out that most of our hotel problems during the stay have been because the builders have been round doing various things. Most of this should go away once they're finished. This has caused the following: Roof terrace closed. Drilling during the daytime. Wet paint all over the place. New fire doors installed in corridors (during our stay these were left without doorhandles over night). WiFi not available due to refurb? (so we were told anyway). Refurbished rooms partitioning lets a lot of sound through walls. Half way during our stay a very vocal group of people occupied rooms either side of ours, due to the thin walls, the singing in the shower sounded like it came from our own bathroom.

I think this is probably due to the fact that the hotel has undergone a pretty extensive rennovation and we had a newly rennovated room. The rooms are small and sparse but what is there is elegant. Marble floors throughout - the bathroom was all marble and very nice! It even had heated towel racks. Our room had an armoire for clothing (with a safe and mini bar) and a plasma TV on the wall. On the down side, the bed was pretty hard. At least a few of the hotel staff speak English, which was helpful. The bar/lounge area has also been rennovated and is quite an elegant place to have a drink. The breakfast room on the roof has great views. The breakfast itself is nothing to write home about, but it's adequate and nice option if you don't like to eat a really big breakfast. Check out the roof terrace at sunset for a beautiful view of the city. You can even see St. Peter's dome. The location for Hotel Veneto is great. Via Veneto is a block away. From there, you can easily walk to the Spanish Steps and the Trevi Fountain. A block in the other direction from the hotel is the Villa Borghese. We walked from the hotel down Via Veneto to the Piazza Barberini almost everyday to use the subway. When we were visiting in February, we got a rate of 120 Euros per night. Sounds like it goes up quite a bit in the summer, but then again, all the hotels in Rome do. In Rome, Hotel Veneto is considered both a 3 and 4 star hotel...the 3 star is the old part and the 4 star is the new part.

We didn't even recognize the hotel because of the scaffolding, and yes, just like another reviewer you couldn't open your window because the scaffold prevented that. The room was old, dingy,and depressing. The a/c didn't work. I guess the mold and the a/c vent that surrounded the stuff were just props.

No wash cloths in Europe.

There's also a Tabachi shop next door to the coffee bar for bus tickets. As for the rates - this is Rome, and lodging is generally expensive.

There were plenty of resturants and cafes within a 5 to 10 minute walk of the hotel. The area was very safe. We were two woman who walked back late at night and there was never a problem. Also the hallways in the hotel are monitored by cameras. The breakfast was good. There was ceral, croissants, rolls, italian bread, and yogart.

The metro stop Barberini (line A) is only 10 minutes walk away providing you with a simple and quick connection to the Vatican and Saint Peters. Our room was spacious and contained mini bar, satelite t.v. (bbc world and cnn) plus air conditioning and en-suite bathroom which had both bathroom and shower.

Finally, on the first day when we arrived the hotel had a slight smell i.e. stale... we enquired what this was and the receptionist informed us that it if it rains excessively then the water levels rise and unfortunately many buildings in the area have this problem... they are working on it and are pressurising Rome council to do something!

I am sure it had not been redecorated or refurnished in 20 years or more. I literally saw nothing, in the room or around the corridors and stairs, which was not scratched, tatty or broken in some way or other. If I'd been paying for a backpackers hostel I'd have been fairly happy - but I was paying for a suite in what I expected to be a quality hotel. The air conditioning worked 25% of the time and when it did it gave out a loud buzz. Needless to say we got zero sleep. It's perhaps revealing that when we checked out early the receptionist asked no questions whatsoever. We got the distinct impression our early departure was commonplace.

Having read many positive but also some very negative reviews of the hotel on Trip Advisor, we were unsure as to what we would find when we got there. What we generally look for when we go on a Citybreak is a clean, comfortable hotel in a good location, and good value for money. At just over 100 euro per night, the Hotel Veneto fitted the bill perfectly. We didn't encounter any of the problems experienced by some other reviewers. Our room was on the second floor, at the front of the hotel. There was traffic on the street outside (amazingly enough), but when you closed the window the noise was minimal. The air conditioning worked fine and we had no problem sleeping. The room was clean, had a large comfortable double bed, spotless sheets every night, and a sparkling bathroom with a good powerful shower. TV reception sometimes wasn't great, but so what, we didn't go to Rome to stay in the room and watch CNN. The hotel has a beautiful airy breakfast room with views over the city. What you get for breakfast varies in hotels all over the Continent but we had no complaints about what we got here- a good choice of cereals, a variety of fresh croissants, breads and preserves, with cappuccino made for you on the spot. Yes, the fruit juice was from a machine (but so what, it tasted OK) The staff at reception were not a problem either. Personalities obviously differ, but any time we asked someone at the desk for advice, they were more than willing to help. They were also efficient and friendly without being obsequious. In fact we found Italians in generally in the streets and on the buses very helpful. I would describe the situation of the Veneto as borderline central. From the hotel it's a 12 minute walk, mostly downhill, to the Spanish Steps ( and a further distance to most of the other principal attractions). It's a lovely walk on a sunny Roman summer morning, but at the end of a hard day's sightseeing, coming uphill, rather more tiring! However, there is a bus from the centre which stops on the Via Veneto, 2 mins away from the hotel. We did walk home late at night though and felt completely safe. From reading the other reviews, it's obvious that some people have had genuine problems at the Veneto, but in our opinion, and from our experience of the hotel, much of the criticism is unreasonable and unfair. On our last evening, we threw our coins in the Trevi Fountain, which traditionally means that we will be going back to Rome again.

We had booked a double room through its website, as had 2 friends with whom we were travelling. We were given a cramped, stale-smelling room (305) with a view of the other internal walls of the hotel. This could have been bearable had it not been for the broken airconditioner and the bathroom, in which the toilet was almost right up against the side wall and the bidet was BUILT INTO THE SMALL SHOWER CUBICLE. As the water was so slow to drain, the water rapidly filled up to the brim of the shower basin, so whatever filth remained in the drain came up too. As a result one had to balance on the raised sides of the cubicle which was downright dangerous. Our friends' room (319) was nice, albeit smaller, with a nice new bathroom and a street view. From seeing other guests complain about their rooms it is clear that although the type of room may be the same (single/double etc) the rooms themselves are not the same and it is a lottery as to what you will get. The reception staff are quite surly, though Gianni and Nicola were OK. The one guy who seems to be the one most commonly referred to in other reviews was Paulo, who was rude, racist, and clearly yearning for a better job. When we politely complained about the room, the shower and the aircon, he just said 'This is a 3-star hotel, what do you expect? It's not going to be perfect'.(!) He said the hotel was full so we could not change rooms, but he'd send someone to check the aircon while we went for dinner (which he did not). The next day we spoke to Nicola who said they were not full and to change rooms would not be a problem. We changed to room 418 which was large, had a nice new bathroom, and was still the same room category we had booked. Breakfast was very mediocre so we brought in our own cheeses and cold cuts. Roof terrace was closed and the hotel was not offering a dinner service.
