It was a shame that this was closed over the weekend, but ample alternatives close by.

We were a little worried about the security of the room considering it is across the road from a home depot store and we noticed a lot of people lingering around the area when we checked in, but we had no issues. Upon checkin we were given our room keys and the tv remote (you had to return it upon check out). Once we got in the room we were pleasently suprised at the size given the price, big open style bathroom with the option of shower head or hand held, a fridge at no extra cost, and a comfy bed and clean, one thing it was missing was an alarm clock. The location is a little bit further than expected to get to the hot spots in Hollywood, but considering we were there for 3 nights and going to Downtown LA for the basketball for 2 of those nights we didnt really mind. The only downfall we had was from the attitude from one of the people at the front desk. Checkout is not until 11am, and considering we were leaving for Australia that day we wanted to use all our time wisley as our flight was not until 10:45pm that same day so we wanted to be organised. At about 10:30am we got a call from the front desk asking us why we hadn't checked out yet, then we got told that checkout was at 11am which we already knew. My fiance had rang the front desk the previous day and asked if it was okay for us to store our luggage there and had explained that we had 4 big suitcases (LA was our last stop on a month trip to america) and our flight was later, they had told us that there would be no problem storing our bags there and were quite nice about it, until we checked out. We handed back our keys and the tv remote to the rude person (not the same person my fiance was talking to the previous day) and then asked if we could store our bags, he looked at us blankly and said \"theres no room, we already have too many bags\", we explained that we called the day earlier and they said it was fine. He replied with an attitude like it was too much hassle and asked us how long our bags would be there for, then proceeded to open the door and told us \"well come on, im not going to carry your bags for you\", we didnt expect him to anyway we were just waiting for him to tell us where to put them.", "Date": "February 18, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Melbourne, Australia", "Title": "\u201cGreat room excellent bed\u201d", "Author": "Sas2744", "ReviewID": "UR118682820", "Content": "I just stayed at the dunes inn on sunset blvd, I was a bit apprehensive about this hotel prior to trip but was pleasantly surprised, the newly refurbished rooms were terrific, as I've a bad back beds are always a worry but the new beds were so good firm but with a pillow top that cushioned the back perfectly, the owners are in the process of revamping all the rooms, the hotel isn't new but money value you won't do better, I also liked the idea of an on site restaurant which offered a good variety from not so healthy to healthy prices were good, and room service was available, they also had a lounge and being close to 7 eleven and a couple of other handy shops, it was also serviced with public transport and pickup for tours, so don't expect the ritz but you won't do better for a comfy bed, clean room, room service and a handy restaurant, I would go back without hesitation the owners were welcoming and very easy to talk to.", "Date": "September 28, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Location": "2", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Service": "1", "Rooms": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "The Hague, The Netherlands", "Title": "\u201cWorst hotel my family ever experienced\u201d", "Author": "Ron B", "ReviewID": "UR118239623", "Content": "The smell in the room was not healthy, the bathroom was full of dirt in the cormers, the matress had a big brown spot and we stopped wondering what it might have been.
