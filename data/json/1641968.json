The hotel is very central and this is what you need for a short visit. After reading some reviews I was worried that we could have ended up in a very tiny room. But to our surprise it was spacious enough with a double bed. That said once at the reception I've over heard a client complaining that the ceiling at her room was way too low for his very tall boyfriend. (So I guess we just got lucky!). The staff is polite and did its best to find an alternative room (don't know if they managed it as I was leaving to get some food). my biggest complain about this hotel is its lack of breakfast facility. OK, it has a vending machine at the reception but I like warm food in the morning !!!!

We're a lively couple in our mid twenties but are both mature professionals when we're not relaxing on holiday! We stayed here for 3 nights and can only sing it's praises! A lot of reviews complain about hotels in Amsterdam being small with steep staircases and very small rooms. This is true, but if people were to research into things before booking with high expectations, they would soon find out that all buildings are like this as it's how they were originally designed! May I also point out that in Amsterdam, you get what you pay for. If you're away on a break, surely you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re out making the most of your time away and only wash and sleep in your room? Anyways, the staff at the reception were nothing but polite and helpful. We arrived at around 5am on our first day, knowing full well that check in wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t until 2pm. The staff informed us that our room was waiting and that we could check in immediately. The room (110) was spotless and we even had use of a safe (that was free of charge). Maids cleaned the room every day without fail and bags and belongings were untouched. The bed was comfortable and the shower was amazing! Hot water was always piping hot from the second the tap was turned on! The hotel is located on a busy street on the outskirts of the Red Light District. The street can get a little busy at night (as to be expected) especially of a weekend. We were fortunate enough to have a room located away from the street. In terms of location, this hotel is extremely well placed! Just a two minute walk to Dam Square in one direction, again the other way for Central Station and again for the Red Light District. My only criticism and I am being really critical! Would be that the window in our room didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t fully seal along the bottom (less that 1mm gap \u00e2\u20ac\u201c so nothing to worry about in terms of security) however, it did mean that at night when it got cold, there was a slight draft if the wind picked up. The extractor fan in the bathroom was not electric, so after a hot shower it got a bit steamy, but was still quick to clear. Would we recommend this hotel?

After enjoying the first trip so much we were disappointed to be put in what I can only think is one of the smallest rooms in the hotel (room 100 above reception) this room was no bigger than the bed, and the door from the hall opened straight into the room, not ideal when someone is in bed and you want to leave. We decided to stick it out until the next morning when I went down to reception and asked if we could change, the staff on reception couldnt have been more helpful. He gave me a key to another room to see if I liked that before moving. It was a nice room but I had my heart set on the room we had the previous year, I returned to reception and asked if we could have that room, he advised that it wasnt available but if we packed our things and went out for the day they would move our luggage into the room we wanted. I have to say I didnt expect that kind of hospitality or flexability! We continued our stay in room 210, I must recommend that if you are booking a 'small double' as advertised, you request this room, you wont be disappointed! Although it is above the street we both managed to sleep well, but street noise could be a problem if you are a light sleeper.

To find our room we took the lift to 3rd floor - however, the room on the 3rd floor was up some very narrow stairs, left, right, up a step and along the narrow corridor.

Phone was not adequately marked on how to contact the front desk, but the information was in the book in the room discussing the hotel. There is a charge for the wireless internet in the room of about 6 euro a day, which is a bit high based on the price of the room when other hotels offfer it free. There are two computers in the basement which can be used for free to access the internet for 30 minutes if all you need to do is a quick internet check of email or check in for airlines. If you get a discounted price, the hotel is nice and probably worth the stay as the location for the city center is very good, but if you have to pay full price, other locations may be better.

The hotel is bang in the red light district and is fantastically located only 5 mins walk from Centraal Station so great in terms of getting from and to Schiphol airport and navigating around the city centre. Not within easy walking distance of the museum quarter (for those interested in the museums); a tram would be needed (nos. 2 or 5) from the station. Booked a standard double room. Compact indeed they are, but v clean and quirky. Beware - the first night I was given room 201 which was right next to the lift, which was noisy all night! Ear plugs were a life saver. Requested a quiet room if possible at the time of booking but there are never any guarantees this can be carried out so didn't create a song and dance about this to hotel staff. The 2nd night I was moved to 316 which was a lovely room overlooking the water but the room sloped (the whole building might slope) and the door to this room had a substantial gap cut away from it at the bottom so it could close! The sound proofing therefore wasn't great here either when other residents were hovering, entering and leaving neighbouring rooms on the same floor. On a huge plus side, the hotel staff were extremely friendly, professional and accommodating and did their best to resolve the problem with the room. The hotel was completely full the first night so I couldn't move to another standard double room and upgrading to a bigger room would have been another 100 euros per night which I opted not to do. Overall, sound proofing aside, this was a convenient, clean hotel to stay in for a couple of nights. I would rate it 'fair' in a category of small contemporary boutique hotels.

As we discovered Hotel CC is located on a narrow street in the red light district. This street is extremely crowded, noisy and in the morning covered in mess from the night before. Hotel CC is a rabbit warren spread over four floors, there is a lift to the third floor, what is totally confusing is that your room maybe on the third floor but having left the lift, to get to it ,you may well go up and down a series of narrow and in some cases very steep stairs. None of us managed to find the stairs from the first floor to the lobby. The first room I was allocated was on the top floor under the eaves the only area where I could stand up straight was in a strip down the centre about 4 feet wide.In fairness on complaining I was allocated another room at the back of the hotel which was much better. The decor in the rooms is good cool whites and greys, the bathrooms are all fitted out to a high standard, in room facilities are also good including high quality towels etc. All my colleagues were amazed at the sizes of the bedrooms & bathrooms - they are diminutive!!! There are only 3 hooks in the rooms to hang jackets - no wardrobes The beds are also exceptionally short. There is no provision for breakfast. The only staff we saw was one person on reception.

Whilst this hotel is right in the midst of the red light district, you are only minutes from Central Station and Dam Square, the back of the hotel faces over the canal that runs along Damrak. We travelled with friends who had a room on the ground floor and we were on the third floor up in the eaves of the hotel, both of our rooms faced into the middle of the hotel so had neither a street or canal view, but this was not a problem. Neither of us had any problems with street noise at all, which was astounding given it was such a busy weekend. We booked through trip advisor and opted for the \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcLuxury\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 room, and we had a real treat, having read lots of reviews and having been to Amsterdam before we fully expected the rooms to be small, but we actually found our room really well laid out and did not have any problems with the size. We did get a very special room which had a mezzanine level with the bedroom upstairs and a living area and the bathroom downstairs. We loved this room, but the staircase was incredibly steep and treacherous. One thing with this hotel, be sure to take a good note of where your room is, the corridors are like rabbit warrens, with steps up and down and doors to different corridors, the floor is a little wonky like most buildings in Amsterdam and there are beams to further bump your head on. One night we very nearly had to go to reception as we couldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t find our room\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6.. it seems that at night they close the various doors along the corridor. The bathroom of the hotel was lovely, it was more or less a fully tiled wet room with a rain head shower. No expense has been spared on the quality of the finish throughout. What is particularly nice is that the original beams are still exposed and really work well with the modern finish. The bed and linen was amazing, one of the most comfortable beds I have ever had in a hotel, with 4 huge pillows, a duvet and lovely white bed covers, it was hard to drag ourselves away from it to get up and going in the mornings. The hotel does not have a breakfast service although they do have a vending machine and a selection of drinks, sandwiches, snacks and hot drinks that you can buy fairly reasonably. This was not any sort of problem for us as there were many places to get breakfast right on the doorstep of the hotel. Unfortunately the hotel does not offer free WIFI, it costs \u00e2\u201a\u00ac4 for 1 hour and you need to buy a card from reception, you can buy longer cards if needed, although they do have 2 computers that you can use for free. We luckily discovered that Hunters Bar opposite the hotel offered free WIFI so we would have coffee and drinks in there to make the most of their WIFI (you need to ask them for the password). The hotel does seem to be incredibly popular so check in was not possible before 2pm, although you can leave your luggage with the hotel when you arrive and leave. All in all we were very very impressed with this hotel and will certainly return next time we are in Amsterdam.", "Date": "March 23, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Birmingham, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cRead This = The real Hotel CC = You get what you pay for!

Located 5 minutes from Central Station, 5 minutes from the Red Light District, 10 minutes from Dam Square and directly on the coffee-shop-strip you could barely be more central to the action. We were greeted with friendly staff who were happy for us to store our bags until check in time. Some exploration of the town later stumbled back to the hotel to check into our room and get ready for the evening. We had booked a small double and i can honestly say i was very impressed with its size. We had a double bed and flat screen tv, with enough storage for our 2 travel cases, and a wardrobe containing approx 10 hangers. It seems that our 'small double' was superior to what some others had experienced. The main draw back to our room was being on the ground floor, right on the roadside with the busy cafes and bars. When i walked in and saw this, i was dreading it. In actuallity the room was peaceful and quiet. It was only used for sleep and the noise levels were perfectly acceptable, and the town seemed to die out not long after we'd finished our night- no partying through the night as we expected. The only bizarre moment was when i opened the curtains (which we kept closed) and found someone leaning against our window from the street. However he was talking on his phone and at this close proximity i couldnt hear a word, so this can only be a positive... right? Anyway back to the clean, tidy, modern room. It was impressively comfortable with a top notch shower/bathroom. We left the hotel for dinner and enjoyed one of the many choices on our doorstep, followed by plenty of bars down this very same strip. Perfect after a day of lots of walking around the beautiful amsterdamian streets and canals. I would highly recomend this stay. The only improvement i would suggest is when you leave your luggage. The staff are happy to store your bags before or after your check in, however there is no form of receipt or ticketing system meaning that anybody could walk in off the street and say they left their luggage. They will be taken to the storage room and can take their pick of any bags they choose- an accident waiting to happen.", "Date": "March 3, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "York", "Title": "\u201cClean, friendly hotel with a great location.\u201d", "Author": "Gibbo_101", "ReviewID": "UR98534592", "Content": "The title says it all really.

Our room overlooked the canal and maybe thats why it was damp all the time - damp on the walls and you could feel it in the air.

The bathroom, while small, was really clean and functional and I have no real complaints about it other than it could have been a tiny bit bigger so you could brush your teeth at the sink without having to open the door to give yourself more room. The hotel's location really depends on what you want from Amsterdam. Be warned...contrary to other reviews it is not outside the red light district. It's slap bang in the middle.

Prior to our trip we read mixed reviews and so were pleasantly surprised by the hotel. One major downside is that the rooms are VERY small, the size of a box room in some cases. Our double room barely fitted us and our suitcase inside! However, it was of modern decor and was clean on arrival. The bathroom was much nicer, although the toilet and sink were in an odd position making sitting on the toilet very awkward! The shower was lovely, very warm and powerful. The rooms were cleaned every day and fresh towels and tea/coffee making provided. Only one spoon though. The reception staff were very friendly and welcomed us to the hotel every time they saw us. Our room (219) had brown masking tape over a ventilation duct and a nail sticking out of the floor! Not ideal. The location is great if you want to be near to the red light district and a wide choice of coffee shops. Not for those who wish to avoid this \"seedier\" side to Amsterdam. We walked to all attractions without any difficulty. Amsterdam proved to be very expensive (14 euro for the van gogh museum, 19 euro for the zoo) so be prepared to spend to see the sights. Overall we felt the hotel was of sound quality for the price we paid, however this was a discounted price! Amsterdam itself is a good getaway for a weekend but a downside is the price for museums if you are on a budget. We enjoyed the red light district- very bizarre but entertaining.

The CC sits next to canals, is in the middle of the coffeehouse district, near the red light district and a was a reasonable walk to the museum district so it was perfect for getting a quick taste of all the things that make Amsterdam a tourist hot spot. I got a standard double which was about as small as I expected from the other reviews. It was a squeeze to move about the room with my two suitcases and garment bag.

That said, the room was clean, the linens were clean, the water was readily adjustable hot and cold and it was quiet for the most part. I did have some rowdy revelers making noise rousing one of their friends a couple doors down at 3AM. I was also near the stairs which are wooden and a bit loud at times.

And, I'll say up front...this hotel deserves the 3.5 rating currently achieved via TripAdvisor, as I'm up for putting down a bet on very few hotels @ ~$150 (U.S.)/night getting a 3 or higher. In general, (from reading reviews and our onsite confirmation) rooms at all levels are expensive and boarder on crappy in Amsterdam. So, on to the review... It was our first time in Europe, so it wasn't super easy to find the place...but that's more to do with OUR lack of preparation. In any event, one of the first lessons learned in Europe was front doors (and initial appearance) are often deceiving. From the outside, and partially because of the cramped / sterile reception area....I thought we'd made a mistake. But, the room was small, tidy, and basic...other than the crazy 'loft' area for our bed. The staircase went like straight up (and I mean straight --- nearly 90 degrees) to the loft!! Quite a challenge in the middle of the night to use the toilet, but we managed. :) Another small aspect is the 'bravery' of a hotel choosing black carpet....while it might 'cover' some things...it also makes every tiny little fleck of lint visible. In short, I applaud the CC for keeping the black carpet pristine...in the hallways and our room! The bed itself was really quite nice....one of the nicest of our trip. The bathroom was small but functional (just like the room). However, our towels had a funky odor. They were clean, but sorta left us smelling faintly like...garlic? We didn't complain, as it seemed trivial. However, it was not the nicest part of our experience in the room. Oh, one amenity that I didn't realize was one until the end of our trip was having a hot water maker in the room for instant coffee and tea. Ours was a little grubby on the outside, but was clean enough. And, as it turns out, having a spot of tea before you leave your room in Europe is not exactly the norm. In all other hotels, we could get tea (just one cup of hot water and a bag of Lipton - yuck) for about $4 (U.S.) in the lobby. :( At night, we did not hear any street noise, but you can hear people getting in and out of their rooms...we could hear people in other rooms around us shuffling around and whatnot, but it turned out all of our hotels in Europe had that problem...you could hear noise from the hallways and movement of other people in other rooms. But, I give this a shoulder shrug in retrospect. The hotel is centrally located (pretty close to Central Station --- certainly walkable) and on one of the super touristy (BUSY) streets near (not in --- as some other reviews state) the Red Light District. Thus said, just a couple turns and you'll be fully exposed to some nearly-naked gals in windows...so don't be too shocked if you're trying to avoid that type of thing. (There are plenty of OTHER touristy/fun locations in Amsterdam, so choose your lodging accordingly.) Upon arrival, the staff wasn't rude, but sorta didn't really care that we were there. As they started to check us in, the staff had side conversations with each other, took phone call(s), and generally took their sweet time getting us checked in. Oh well. The gentleman was very nice about escorting us to our room via elevator....recommended for hauling luggage most of the way to the room only...should plan to use the steep and narrow stairs for most other journeys to/from your room. Those that complain the lift didn't get them all the way to the doorstep of their room should be aware than just about any hotel under $250-300/night in AMS is HIGHLY unlikely to have an elevator at all....just throwing that out there for the ungrateful. (We stayed two additional nights in AMS at the end of our trip in a similar accommodation without an any elevator at all....the CC spoiled us.) Overall, this was a great stay in a 3 Star Hotel (not talkin the Ritz here...3 Stars it is). I would highly recommend to friends, but maybe not relatives (if that makes any sense)? For the price and location, I certainly would not hesitate to stay here again. P.S. If you're into locally brewed beer, do not miss out on the brewery/restaurant (sign is shaped like a yellow and blue raindrop) that's just up the street a little ways. We spent 5 days in Belgium, and ended up liking one of their brews better than most of those in Belgium...I think the beer was called Willike...or something like that??? I know it was a Wit beer....do not miss (if you like that sorta thing).

The hotel itself has had a total renovation making it clean, sharp and modern. We were initially situated in the 'double special' rooms and these were extremely snug lets say! Following a breif chat with the guy on reception, he very kindly relocated us into twin rooms which had exponentially more room. He did this at no extra cost and even had our luggage relocated by the time we got back from our trip out that day. A very friendly, approachable and flexible service at reception. Excellent customer service. The rooms themselves are very clean, modern and inviting.

I had been looking into some of the other cheaper hotels that are further from the center, but felt as a single woman traveling alone it would've been a bit dangerous. The location of the Ce Ce was great, I stumbled right into the hotel when I left the train station. I booked a single room, and they aren't kidding when they say it's for only one person. I could barely turn around in there without walking into something. However it was perfectly clean and safe, and updated so I was very happy with it. Also the view at night from my window was amazing. I only had a small roller suitcase with me, but I think if I had anything bigger it wouldn't have fit in the room. And despite being in the heart of all the 'coffeshops', it was really quiet at night. I slept perfectly and didn't need the earplugs that I had brought. It also helps that I booked this hotel through my Citibank Thankyou network, so it was basically free for me to stay, which is even better!

After booking, I found the thread about the mysterious hotel CC and was very worried. Have just returned. literally landed an hour ago, and wanted to post my review while everything is fresh in my mind, so here goes from the begining... When we booked, via the hotels web-site which redirected us to Hoteliers, we booked 2 double rooms - 1 of which was to be accessable for a wheelchair user - and 1 twin. We also, to make sure as it was important, emailed the hotel and put our requests to them, quoting the booking reference given to us by hoteliers. After sending this email we received 3 requests for credit card information, however my email server had put these mails in my spam box, and as I only go through spam every blue moon, just before deleting it, I didnt find them until a few days before the trip. I emailed hoteliers to check, as we had arranged when we booked with them to guarantee rooms with credit card, but to pay cash in euros on arrival at the hotel. They said it was still the case, the hotel just waned to pre-check the card incase we did not show so they could charge the cancelation fee of one nights stay. However, the day before our trip they debited the credit card for the full cost of the stay. It wouldnt have been a problem if they had stated at the begining, that because they were offering a special 'opening offer' rate, it needed advance payment, but please be aware this may happen when you book. On arraval at the hotel, we were told that the room for the wheelchair user was a twin on the third floor ( not a problem because there is a lift, I thought) but then the man described it is only up and down a few steps then round the corner that might be difficult in the chair! We checked the other rooms we had been allocated, all of which were actually twins, and the one for the teenage girls on the ground floor was the only one accessable ( the third was on floor 4 - not served by the lift), so we took that, after a lot of trouble with the reception man to explain - he kept insisting the room on floor 3 was better, just mind the stairs. Once in the room, we had room 003, it was nicely decorated, and very modern in feel - but just small. There were 2 twin beds next to each other, filled with pillos and cushions, a nice crisp white duvet trimmed with grey covers. There was a large wall mounted flat screen tv, tea and coffee facilities, an free electronic safe, and a chair. Also, there is a phone to ring room to room, however in 2 of the 3 rooms we had the inter room service was not working. There were no wardrobes or drawers for clothes and no space to store them really, however, as we were only there for 2 nights it was no big deal to live out of our suitcase but for any longer - or a special occasion where clothes need to be hung - it may be a problem. In the bathroom, which again was small, there was a shower with glass panel seperating it from the toilet area and basin. It also had a hairdryer. The shower had a large shower head, and a smaller, hand neld shower attachment, so you could use either, as suited. There were soap and shampoo/shower gel also provided, although it was a bit gloopy, and not particularly nice smelling, but saves taking your own if traveling with hand luggage only, with todays restrictions on liquids in mind. As previous reports have stated, the air conditioning/heating cannot be turned off , just down and up. We had it on its highest setting, as it was freezing out. The room was quite cool, but did warm up, however we didnt turn temp down at all day or night. It wasnt too cold, but I would prefer to go there in the spring/summer than winter. Towels and bed linen, were clean and nice, and changed daily. There is a vending area in the reception, which offers drinks (soft and alcoholic - 2.50 euros for a can of heiniken) and snacks (1 euro a chocolate bar), and coissants can be bought at breakfast time and eaten in the 'eat and relax' area downstairs (not accessable by lift) down there there are tables to eat snacks or take aways that can be brought into hotel, and also a computer. The hotel did not have complimentary maps, so told us to look at leaflets for tourist attractions which may have maps, nor do they offer any sort of Concierge service - in fact when we were checking out and I asked if they would post my postcards - which were already stamped - they just said no, post box is near central station. The hotels location can be seen as a plus if you are looking to stay close to the nightlife of the notorious area of town, without being in the middle of it, but only 2 streets away from the moulin rouge. It would be more of a minus if you are traveling with children or older maiden aunts with a dodgy heart! There are plenty of cafes and bars on the street, as well as a number of coffeshops and some 'toy' shops - if you know what I mean. There are also several restaurants, including chinese, spanish, indonesian, argantinian and italian, along the street. The shuttle from the airport does not pick up at this hotel, so if you plan using this service, if you want a return, book to go go either the hotel Barbizon Palace (200m down Warmeosstasse) or Hotel Terminus (150m turn right then left) Cost of this is 24.50 euros. We asked for our hotel and the conexxions desk said we do not do return there and were going to sell us one way only - which works out more expensive, but the accepted return to other hotels as above without problem. The station is also within waling distance - about 10 min walk away (approx 350yrds). Would stay here again if I got the same sort of rate and request the room I have used before but also check by phone, and would expect my card to be changed in advance regardless of what they say.", "Date": "March 11, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "The Hague, The Netherlands", "Title": "\u201cGreat quality for city centre!\u201d", "Author": "damsqu", "ReviewID": "UR57961964", "Content": "As a regular visitor to Amsterdam, I can confidently say this hotel is great quality.

All in all this hotel was the perfect base for us for the weekend, in a great location - not too far to walk to all attractions. It was clean, modern & friendly & very reasonably priced for a city centre hotel. We will definately go back to this hotel & certainly would recommend to others. Great weekend!

It is on the strip that runs parallel to the Damrak and the back of the hotel has rooms that look over the hotel and the front of the hotel looks out onto the main strip that has lots of Coffee Shops, Cafes and places to eat. It is lively, some will see this as a bonus - others if you are going for a more cultural visit wont like it, you'd be better off staying near the museum quarter if thats what you are after. We couldn't have asked for a better location though! So central! The rooms are small but as far as I can understand spacious hotels arent so easy to come by in Amsterdam unless you are looking for something more like a 4* or 5* hotel, especially when they are in old buildings so I was expecting this. It is true though that if you were staying for a long period of time you may want a bigger room, but for 3 nights it was fine. I can agree the aircon isnt the quiestest I have ever heard but I didnt really see it as a major problem. There was no problem with the heating when we went, as I was worried it would be cold as people have commented on other sites that the heating was not working, but our room got quite toasty, which was good as it was freezing over there!!! The rooms were clean, bed was sooo comfy and warm! The shower was amazing. I really need a shower like that at home :) I loved the way the room was decorated. The whole hotel was clean and fresh. There was a lift which was a bonus. Clean towels every day. Bathrooms were lovely and clean and fresh, small, but i would rather have a good shower in a clean bathroom than some of the dirty showers i have seen in a big bathroom. with all those horrible shower curtains and dirty tiles! One word of advice, if you check in early, ask for a room with canal view, it will be quieter, as I mentioned it is on a lively street and the rooms on the front, you can hear some people in the street. They tried to give me room 101 when I first checked in but I refused this as it is on the ground floor, window to the street and I did not like this as there is a lot of people traffic on that street. The staff were very friendly and were so helpful when I asked to change rooms etc. I would definately recommend this hotel to people who are after the same kind of break as me, to discover the city warts and all as there is some hocking stuff round there, but not to older people or families as the area is very lively!", "Date": "February 23, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "2", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "liverpool england", "Title": "\u201cgreat location\u201d", "Author": "jessicasweep", "ReviewID": "UR56241437", "Content": "the location of this hotel was great the rooms were very clean as the hotel is new,however after the first night we had to be moved because the air con was making to much noise and it coludnt be switched off at all??and there was banging from next door because of building work in a restaurant.the staff were very pleasant and understood.the rooms were beautifully decorated and beds were very comfortable, we had quite a big room which was great for are 4 night stay.on are last day my boyfriend nearly got hit in the head by the lamp shade which fell from the celling and the towel rail near a came out of the sockett as i was getting a towel the night before!!attention to detail is needed!!!", "Date": "February 17, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Sleep Quality": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "County Antrim, N.
