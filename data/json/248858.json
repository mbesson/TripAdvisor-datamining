The breakfast included was served on the roof terrace and offered a great variety of pastries, juices, fruits, quiches, meats and cheese, including very good coffee. The location was excellent, surrounded by many restaurants, cafes and shops. Our room opened to the street below which only allows pedestrians or taxi's with permission, so other than chatter, you are not bothered by car noise. We were two blocks from the Spanish steps and easy walking distance to many other top sites. The entire staff helped in so many ways I'm not sure where to begin. We arrived with wet luggage/clothes due to a bad storm in Chicago where our luggage must have sat on the runway with the plane and they immediately helped with the drying process. Arriving at 9:00am Rome time, they allowed us to rest and unpack the wet clothing in a smaller room than our Junior suite which was still sizeable and decorated nicely. Every restaurant suggestion was excellent, directions even better for sites, walking, etc. We encountered a car rental problem when leaving for Positano, but they were able to correct and locate a new car which even took them extra time speaking Italian, so doubt we would have been as successful without their help.

There is practically nothing else good about this hotel, the entrance is tiny that you can barely see it if you are a few buildings away which scared us a bit, then you go into a very narrow long corridor to the reception, two people cannot pass side by side in this corridor, one day as i was entering the housekeeping lady was standing with her things and we spent a few minutes trying to pass by eachother without dropping everything we were holding or squashing eachother. The elevator did some weird noises as were going up and it is in bad need for renovation. The conceirge is not very informative or knowledgable about rests. or reccomendations, I asked her about a couple of restaurants which were supposedly famous she didnt know them, when I asked her for reccomendation for a typical italian restaurant she said she had to think about it and call me back and when she did she reccomended a rest that was close but average at best. We had also requested the pick up service from the airport which turned out to be more expensive than a taxi, around 15-20 more euros, he was standing with a barely legible sign with our name we spent ten minutes looking for him, he drove while talking on the phone and alot of people were honking their horns at him for his driving AND he ran an errand while we were with him taking us on a detour to be able to do that!! The breakfast they informed us we could have in the breakfast room or in our room we opted for our room, but that was a horrific experience, the coffee tasted cold and ugly (the first and last ugly weird tasting coffee I had in Italy), the croissant was not fresh, the honey was frozen, and the five jams they got us were all in one flavor! when I complained to the receptionist, I think she was surprised or didnt understand but the breakfast the next day was worse with the croissant worse then the first day and the same weird coffee I didnt have any breakfast and we ate it outside! Other than that there was basically no extra service that is usually associated with boutique hotels, or four star hotels, like bathrobes, or slippers, or nice shampoos or creams. Nothing extra that I expected. My mother described it like renting a tiny flat rather than a hotel room which I think fits. For me this is overpriced for what it serves and I would never stay there again.", "Date": "January 14, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Belgium", "Title": "\u201cPerfect !\u201d", "Author": "Sbavay", "ReviewID": "UR6176946", "Content": "I found this hotel looking reviews on tripadvisor, and choose it because of the good results, no regrets : staff very sympathic and helpful, situation very good, breakfast very varied.

We stayed 3 nights and couldn't have been more pleased. I'm a fanatic about researching hotels and in Rome there are many excellent choices, but this hotel turned out to be a terrific for us, mainly because of its small size (I am a fan of boutique hotels), central location, the friendly staff, and qualilty accommodations. We were upgraded to a junior suite and although I initially was concerned that it faced the street from the second level (first floor in Europe), the street is mainly a pedestrian one (except taxis are allowed to deliver you and your luggage to the hotel's front door) so there was little noise and the heavy draperies could be closed to block out light. The room and the bath were the largest we've ever had in all of our European travels and beautifully decorated in an Italian baroque style. Although that style doesn't reflect our personal design taste, it seemed very appropriate for our time in Rome. The ceilings were exceptionally high and the room and bathroom were immaculate and the king sized bed incredibly comfortable. We ate breakfast on the top floor. While not a roof terrace because it is enclosed, the massive windows make it feel like you are outside, looking over the rooftops. The food was plentiful and varied and typical of an Italian breakfast with mainly cold items, which suited us fine. We enjoy walking and were able to walk to most sites and restaurants. In fact, on the first morning, we walked to the Vatican to meet our tour guide from Angel Tours (only 4 of us in the group which was wonderful considering how crowded it was). We also walked to most other places we visited, including the Trastavere area (now that's a trek!) and back from the Colosseum. The hotel is close to the Spanish Steps and the main upscale shopping area. While we didn't do any serious shopping we enjoyed walking in the area and looking into the elegant and interesting window displays. We had excellent meals in different Rome neighborhoods, each of which we walked to at least one way. My only complaint would be a lack of internet service. While there was dial up internet if you brought your laptop, we had to go quite a distance to find an internet cafe to use to check our email. In all the other boutique properties at which we stayed, the hotel provided a computer on site for the guests.", "Date": "September 26, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "4.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Seal Beach, CA", "Title": "\u201cGreat Boutique Hotel\u201d", "Author": "jjtwo", "ReviewID": "UR5318073", "Content": "Stayed 2 nightat at the Hotel Daniel.

My husband and I travelled to Rome for a six days to celebrate my 50th birthday. The staff at Daniel's Hotel was professional and kind at all times. When I didn't understand how to use the room's telephone to make a collect call, a staff person immediately came to our room to show me. We spoke no Italian, but it really didn't matter, the staff spoke English and were always gracious. Our room, the bathroom, hallways, etc. were immaculately clean. Our white marble bathroom wasn't huge, but nicer than any international bathroom we have ever had. We wanted a small, peaceful, intimate, Italian hotel experience; Daniels hotel was perfect for us.Via Frattina is a great location, lot's of shops, very safe,area for evening walks. We walked everywhere, to the Trevi Fountain, to the (very nearby)Spanish Steps and to the Pantheon. Dinner at La Rampa, behind the American Express Building was a nice suprise, reasonably priced too. My only suggestion for improvement would be to spice up the variety of food offered at the roof top breakfast bar upstairs. The coffee, fruit, pastries and ham were delicious however.

We stayed there 9/3/2005 for 2 nights. It's a short ride by cab from the Train station* and a great central location. Daniel's is small, only 14 rooms, but is a 4 Star beauty. Via Frattina is a lovely, quiet, shopping street. Cars are mostly prohibited. So except for scooters, which are everywhere, Via Frattina predominantly has foot traffic. It is a short walk to the Spanish steps, and the Trevi fountain. It is a longer, yet do-able walk to the Colloseum. Our room, a junior suite, was beautifully furnished, clean and very comfortable. The bathroom was large, with a Jacuzzi and Italian marble throughout. Breakfast is served on the rooftop,which is enclosed with windows. You can see the rooftops of Rome from here! Daniel's also has very good cappuccino...order one with your breakfast! *You can rent a car cheaper at the Train station than at the Airport. We didn't use a car in Rome, but rented it there and traveled around Italy for a week. I would only recommend this for the brave. Italians drive fast, a lot of the roads are curvy, and gas is over $5.00 a gallon.
