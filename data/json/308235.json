We had a problem with the window but the maintenance guy fixed it once we called, roomservice is good. The hotel had a great advantage on the meaning of the view on Dubai Creek and it is just 400m far from Al Ras metro station which is a big advantage for us. As i said in the title it is just a 3 star hotel so i was not expecting more of what i got. The disadvantages were mainly the Night Club on the 10th floor.

As we had a 'jam packed' itinerary we did not want to pay for a expensive hotel, as we would really only be sleeping there. However as the hotel is rated as a 3 star, we thought we would still be staying in a fairly decent hotel. We looked at trip advisor before we travelled to Dubai and on the advice of other people we requested a room near the ground floor because of a night club on the top floor. Despite being located on the second floor we could still hear the music. It was also very apparent that 'ladies of the night' frequented the nightclub upstairs. This personally did not bother us as the girls did not approach us, and were friendly enough when we were in the same lift, but it is blatent and understandably may offend some people. Although a non smoking hotel, the entire hotel and our room smelt of stale tobacco. We moved onto Bangkok after Dubai and the smell still hung to our clothes. We believed there was also a problem with the air conditioning, it sounded as though it was leaking and the room felt damp. The room was very big, the bed linen was clean and towels were replaced daily, but despite claims of a refurbishement, our room (and the hotel in general) felt dirty and dated. For the price thar we paid for the hotel we were not expecting a luxurious room, however we did expect a basic clean room. Breakfast was included in the price of room, but we only bothered with it one day. There was not much choice, the breakfast cereal tasted stale and the coissants too. St George is loacted within walking distance of the Souks, and our room did have an excellent view of the creek. There are water taxis that can take you to the otherside of the creek to Bur Dubai which seemed to sell clothing etc a lot cheaper than the souks. St George is located in Deira, we personally preferred Jumeriah which is the more modern and deveoped part of Dubai. We are aware that hotels are no doubt more expensive in this part of Dubai, but my husband and I wished we had paid a bit extra for a better standard of hotel.", "Date": "November 12, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Service": "3", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Manchester", "Title": "\u201cavoid G&Ts at the St George\u201d", "Author": "GreavesManchester", "ReviewID": "UR82227489", "Content": "My friend and I called into the St George Hotel to rest and have a drink before beginning shopping in the gold and silver souk.

Gold market & textile market of Deira is located just about 5 minutes walk from this hotel. Also incase you need to visit Bur Dubai, which is other half of Dubai, this hotel is the ideal place. Since the Abra (small boat) can take you to Bur Dubai at a very cheap price rather than spending DRS 10-15 by a taxi. Breakfast is included in your package, which is excellent. The tarriff starts from about $60 to $150 & rooms are spacious & has fantastic view of the creek & market. It has a happening Bar & Rest as the ground level.

I wish they could have provided more than the standars eggs beef sausages and arabic beans - leaves little or no choice for vegans although my wife stuck to croissants and fruit. Now, if you're anything like my wife who likes shopping then you'll love the endless markets located just behind this hotel. More prominently the spice market. As gold is relatively cheap (not that cheap compared with India) you have the Gold Souk around the corner. Getting around is easy as you have the Abras just up the road to take you across the creek to Bur Dubai where you can shop in Meena Bazar. Cost is 1AED for 2 people.
