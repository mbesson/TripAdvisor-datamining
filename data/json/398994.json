Bathroom very basic though everthing works. Shower could be dangerous getting into and out of if unstable or elderly as no hand grips. The single bed was very hard and low off the floor. I will pay more next time for more comfort and for a/c. Very central, pleasent staff and good German style breakfast.

Positive is the location it is near S & U bahn and the metro and normal bus stop is adjacent to the entrance. The room and bathroom were very clean and the staff very friendly. The price was reasonable but not cheap. Negative was whilst asking for a credit card to hold the booking when we arrived we were informed it was cash only and had to be paid up front. This left us short of ready money. In the room the bed sat direct of the floor and hence very low. The room was very hot and the temperature could not be controlled. The stairway is uncovered old wooden boards and the decoration is much need of restoration.", "Date": "January 22, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Los Angeles, CA, USA", "Title": "\u201cGreat hotel!

The neighborhood is generally quite off of the main road (in Charlottenburg) and a nice tranquil park is located within 5-10 minutes of walking west. Hotel room was cleaned very well with nice tall ceilings and big windows looking into a central courtyard. Also had a very nice closet, TV, bathroom, and balcony. Breakfast was typical but fresh.

As soon as we arrived there the hospitality shown by the staff was AWSOME! We stayed in room 3 and had a good view of the private courtyard. The previous reviewer wasn\u2019t lying when they said the showers were good. You get to enjoy discounted bar prices and the hotel has a lovely Italian Bistro. Ask for their famous Blick Vodka & Coke. The staff even bring you complimentary snacks (Spicy sausage) to eat as you enjoy your drink. The rooms were comfortable and the location of the hotel means it\u2019s very easy to explore the city via local transport. Some good local bars and clubs in the area. The staff in the hotel will assist in giving you directions. Remember if there is a queue of young people, join it! You might end up in a very good exclusive club!!!!!!!!!!!!!!", "Date": "May 24, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "3.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Cardiff, Wales, United kingdom", "Title": "\u201cStag Weekend\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR3449450", "Content": "Stayed in the Hotel City Blick whilst on my stag do in Berlin. The hotel is on a busy road so don't expect to get much sleep, however when you bear in mind that the bars don't normally close til 8/9am then sleep wasn't really an option anyway! The first thing I'd say is that the rooms have obviously not been decorated since the website was done. However, if all you are looking for is a cheap place to stay then they are perfectly adequate providing you're not the type of person who like to stay in their room all day long. Beds are very small and also fairly old. However, the shower in the room was excellent and the bathroom was clean. Also if you'd like a room with a balcony ask for room 8. The hotel has a bar and restaurant attached and both the food and service in these were excellent, with the barmen being very friendly and also being able to give plenty of suggestions on where to spend the evening. There are a few bars and clubs within immediate walking distance or you can always catch the city train into central Berlin for 2 euros, with the train station also being within walking distance. At the end of the day you pay for what you get and if you're looking for somewhere cheap to stay with no frills then this place is pretty much what you'd expect. Saying that if I was going over again on a boys trip then I'd have no hesitation in staying here but I wouldn't recommend it if you're taking the wife or the girlfriend.
