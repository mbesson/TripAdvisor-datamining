Unfortunately, to get off the train at the Airport, you have to pay a special airport tarriff, so this is not a station you want go back and forth to. It was fine for us because it was our last night and we decided not to go down to City Central to see the fireworks. If we had, it would have been expensive to leave and come back on the train. We watched the fireworks from a little window on one of the upper floors.....saw only part of them....but at least we can see we saw them. There are several fast food restraunts right next door which was handy and in our price range. Staff was very nice and extremely helpful. We had a problem with our toilet, and someone came up immediately and fixed for us. We did not eat onsite or use the laundry facilities.

Breakfast is good and includes juices, cereals and toast with various spreads although it doesn't start until about 6am which is a pain if you have an early morning flight. A shuttle can be booked to drop you off at any of the terminals when you leave and only costs about $8 AUD. There are several fast food restaurants next door including Mc Donalds, KFC and Krispy Creme Donuts. There is of course cafes etc in the airport as well.

The only reason that I'd ever stay at this Formule 1 hotel is if I was catching a flight the next day. If however, like me, you just want somewhere close to several food options, within a few dollar taxi ride of the domestic and international air terminals, and don't want to spend a fortune doing it, then look no further. I stayed in the Formule 1 hotel in November 2011, with my wife and 2 children. We had a 6am flight to catch the next morning, so we caught the train down to Sydney, and got off at the Sydney domestic terminal station. From there it was a 10 minute walk to the Formule 1. Check was quick and painless, but not overly friendly. The young guy working the wasn't very friendly or welcoming, and my guess that was he was sick of of his job, or life, or both. Either way, after a long train ride with 2 tired children, no chit-chat suited us fine, and we made our way to the room. Yes the rooms are small. Yes the rooms are very basic. I like to call them the F.A. hotel chain (because you get SFA in the way of extras with your room). If you are staying for more than one night, I'd strongly urge you to look elsewhere. If, like us, you want somewhere clean, well priced and as close to the airport terminals as it is possible to get, then the Formule 1 fits the bill nicely. Our room had a double bed, and 2 bunk beds. The bathroom was obviously a pre-manufactured plastic cubicle that the rest of the room was built around, and was small enough that if you angled the shower head right you could shower while sitting on the toilet (which was pretty good fun I must admit). Luxuries in the room were completely absent. It had air conditioning, beds, an alarm clock, a chained down 34cm TV (as if someone would try to steal a 34cm CRT), and not much else. Our room had a single window with majestic sweeping views of a concrete wall. While on our holiday, I kept a nightly trip blog of our adventures. The hotel has no wired internet in the rooms, but it does have paid internet in the lobby, or slightly more expensive wifi available in the room, which I made use of. From memory it was a few dollars for half an hour. The hotel is next door to several food and coffee options. Krispy Kreme is right next door, and next door to that is McDonalds, and KFC is a few doors down from that. both Krispy Kreme and McDonalds have wifi available if you need an free internet connection. There is also a shuttle service to the domestic and international air terminals available. Starting at 6am and arriving every 15 minutes, the service costs $6 per adult. We had to be at the airport much earlier than 6am however, so we rang a taxi, which arrived on time, and worked out to less than $10 to get to the terminal. Much cheaper than a shuttle would have cost us. A tip: If you have more than 1 person, book a taxi instead of catching the shuttle bus. It will work out cheaper. *Much* cheaper if you have 2 or more adults. To summarise, if you're staying for more than 1 night, or you want a few luxuries or award winning service, then look elsewhere. You'll be disappointed, and you'll probably end up here writing a bad review at some point in the future. If however you only need a place to sleep, which is clean, functional, quiet, right at the airport, close to several dining options, and at an absolutely unbeatable price, then Book the F1 hotel.", "Date": "February 4, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "1", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "New South Wales", "Title": "\u201cDoes in a pinch\u201d", "Author": "SoCalexpat", "ReviewID": "UR123897901", "Content": "Did not expect more than a basic room.

The room was bigger than I expected and was dark and quiet, which would have made sleeping easy. However, thge bed was ordinary, to say the least, and was too lumpy to sleep perfectly in. The room had a tv, though the reception on some channels was bad. The service was also great and considering how cheap it was, service really didn't need to be anything special, but it was good to see the staff go out of their way for the customers. Some things were missing (we only got half a roll of toilet paper, no tissues, no tea or coffee, no shampoo or soap) but considering how cheap and close to the airport it is, I'm not surprised that some services were missing. Breakfast was also served, but I had an early flight and it wasn't open when I check out, but it shares a carpark with Krispy Kreme donuts and is right next to a Macca's and KFC. The best aspect of the hotel was how close it was to the airport, walking distance to domestic terminal and 2-3 min drive to international. Considering I lived 3 hours away from the airport when I stayed, paying $112 for a room less than 5 mins from the international airport (considering I'd already spend thousands on the holiday) the Formule 1 is perfect airport hotel to stay at. They also offer a shuttle to the international terminal, which was $6 a person. To conclude, the Formule 1 is not the best or most up market hotel I've ever stayed at, but the price/value is amazing for the location, just expect a cheap, basic room, nothing more.

You can walk to the domestic terminal in 8-10 minutes with no difficulty", "Date": "June 29, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Sleep Quality": "2", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Service": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Canberra Australia", "Title": "\u201cMake no mistake, this is very, VERY basic, you get safe, clean place but not value for money\u201d", "Author": "DRMB", "ReviewID": "UR114846214", "Content": "This is very, VERY basic accommodation. It is very \"bare bones\". You get nothing extra. NOTHING! It\u2019s like the rooms were made of fibreglass in a factory, the carpet sprayed on together with paint, and trucked to the site then stacked up together. I imagine this is also like a prison cell but more colourful. Some things to note: It is quite a walk from the Sydney Airport domestic terminal, especially the domestic terminal train station, especially if it is raining. Suggestion is to walk to the Terminal (Terminal 2?) where Virgin is and stay on that side of the road (that is keep the parking station on your left) until the road curves to the left. Then take the cross road on the right and walk one block. Do not go towards the motel with the carpark on your right. You end up having to cross 6 lanes of busy road with no cross walk or pedestrian crossing. This was so dangerous that I back tracked to the carpark and crossed over to the Virgin terminal and started again. Added about 30 minutes to the walk. This is not a short walk if you have luggage (why else would you stay here?) and it took 30 minutes from the Virgin Terminal. Take your own food, there is nothing close by except Dunking Donuts! The TV is very small but it provides noise and a few channels. There is no phone in the room. The room has like a double bed with a 3rd bed over that, and they take up most of th room in the hotel. You get no amenities, maybe only a small bit soap the size of a matchbox, and a few paper cups from memory. The shower and toilet are so small, the toilet gets wet when you have a shower. However, it was very clean and provided shelter for a few hours while waiting for the next morning flights to start (on account Sydney airport is closed overnight because of a permanent curfew) Considering the deals on the internet eg on What If or Last Minute there are far FAR better value hotels in downtown, EG consider on the train line that goes from Sydney airport the Great Southern, easy walk from the Central Railway station, or the many hotels at that end of Sydney, or others near Pitt St which are easy walking distance from the Museum station or the St James station. They also have the advantage of many pubs, restaurants, eating places especially around Dixon Street. Consider this ONLY if you are in transit overnight between the Domestic and Int Terminals, or vice versa, and have your eyes wide open about what you are paying for", "Date": "June 28, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Merriwa", "Title": "\u201cFormula one nights stay\u201d", "Author": "travellerMerriwa Posted by an Accorhotels.com traveler", "ReviewID": "UR114839568", "Content": "Budget accommodation very good bed not too comfy pillows really bad maybe need better bllankets on bunks kids slept cold otherwise was quite good for budget.

You certainly do not want to shower before bed, because the floor in that room will be wet all night and you won't have towels for the morning unless you bring your own. - There are no toiletries provided other than a bar of soap, so plan accordingly and bring your own. - You may be able to hear the planes, depending of course on which runway they are using. The hotel is near to the flight path for one of the runways (the short one which is generally used by 737/airbus a320 type aircraft as well as lighter planes). However there is a curfew which I believe starts between somewhere between 10pm to midnight and 6am, so you will have at least 6 hours without any aircraft noise. The good things - - Right next door to Krispy Kreme and Mcdonalds, so if you need food or a sugar rush or coffee you do not have to walk very far. If you want something to eat other than Krispy Kreme or Maccas, you can go to terminal 2 and get a larger range of foods to choose from. Bear in mind you will need to clear airport security to access that food court in terminal 2. You could also go to terminal 3 but they do not have as large a range of food. - A fairly short walk to the domestic terminals - when I say short, you would probably want to be wearing comfortable shoes and not carrying too much. - The beds themselves are reasonably comfortable if only you have a decent pillow. Would I recommend this hotel to a friend? Only in certain circumstances - and I would make sure to tell them the above so they can make up their own mind. If I had to recommend a hotel airport and budget was an issue, this would be the one. If they did not mind spending a little bit more, I would recommend the nearby Stamford.", "Date": "March 28, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Lincoln, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cCheap and value for money no frills\u201d", "Author": "raycrabb", "ReviewID": "UR58914837", "Content": "Was surprised as this was a new building, had presumed the opposite from reading other reviews.Our room was on the 5th floor it was cramped but clean, a little bewildering have a bunk bed above your head, for one night stay this was acceptable but would not like to stay longer.

Every time I stay there the rate seems go up, the last time it was $84 a night, but there is no charge for parking now so that's a plus. Its long corridors, cheap carpet and heavy automatic closing doors make for a noisy nights sleep. When the room doors close near-by you certainly hear them. But once you're accustomed to them, they are not a problem. Positives: Great value, close to airport, friendly and helpful staff, air-conditioned rooms, very clean rooms and linen, airport facing rooms have a great view, double glazing, next door to Krispy Kreme. Negatives: Noisy at night before everyone goes to bed.", "Date": "June 12, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Brisbane, Australia", "Title": "\u201cDouble glazed windows were great!\u201d", "Author": "Kyls40", "ReviewID": "UR7303347", "Content": "Very basic rooms, but clean, tidy and fairly new.
