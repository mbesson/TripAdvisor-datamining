We were there to see the old Venice, and the new, namely the International Art Exhibit, the Biennale, hosted by Venice every 2 years on the odd year. The hotel\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s location was ideal for the Biennale as it was situated between the 2 Biennale venues, the Arsenale, open to the public only during Biennale, and the Botanical Gardens, close to the lagoon. Hotel Sant\u00e2\u20ac\u2122Anna was pleasantly away from the rush and congestion of the Piazza San Marco, but within easy and delightful walking distance, about 20 minutes along the lagoon with all its wonderful views. The vaporetto stops were conveniently located: at the western end of Via Garibaldi to the airport and the Grand Canal, and at the eastern end over the bridge to Isola St. Pietro and Murano and Burano. A taxi picked us up steps from the hotel on the smaller canal off the St Pietro Canal. Many restaurants line the Via Garibaldi, as well as fresh fruit and fish sold from the boats a few feet from the hotel. We bought some good Veneto wine from a delightful little wine shop for 2.50 euros. We also used a grocery store and pharmacy. The hotel is run by the family of owners, and Walter was always more than helpful and patient, no matter how busy. Directions, taxis, anything was not too much for him. The breakfast served every morning, was more than adequate, croissants, yogurt, juice and delicious cappuccino or espresso. Our room, small of course, being in Venice, where space is at a premium, had a window looking out on a courtyard, a radiator for the damp when it rained, and an adjoining bathroom with lots of hot water for the shower. It was very clean and the twin beds we had were very comfortable. The furniture was antique Venice, including night tables, a small desk, an armoire and chairs. The cleaning attendants were pleasant, flexible and thorough. The hotel has larger rooms with a canal view, we booked a little late for them but my glimpse of one near us impressed me. There was also a pleasant lounge on the 2nd floor with a balcony overlooking the canal St.Pietro. The only issue we had with the hotel was occasional difficulty with the courtyard door. There was a buzzer system to gain entrance but it was a little idiosyncratic. However, someone always came quickly to let us in, in person. We had keys for the main hotel door and often were late coming back, but always before the curfew . Venice closes down early so this was never an issue. We would certainly stay at the Hotel Sant\u00e2\u20ac\u2122Anna again as it suited our needs and pocketbook.

What a pleasant surprise! Walter was so kind and helpful- he even booked my train reservation to Firenze - and the charm of the place completely captivated me. You arrive at a corte and tucked in the far corner is a door with a small discreet sign. When you press the bell and are allowed in, you are entering an enchanted garden- a small beautiful courtyard with Wisteria and other bushes. The reception was very welcoming and set the tone for the whole stay.The breakfast is the normal continental style but I never left feeling hungry although I am normally a full English( or Scottish) breakfast man and the service was faultless. My room was small but for the price I paid, more than adequate. It was slightly inconvenient to have to go to the bathroom but not that difficult once one got into the habit. The location is wonderful. The area is like a discrete village separate from the centre of Venice but only 15 minutes walk from Piazza San Marco. There are several good ristoranti within 5 minutes walk and a whole selection of shops including banks and post office. The views from the hotel of the Canal and chiesa San Pietro are stunning.and next time I come with my partner , I shall book a room with a bathroom ( Walter was kind enough to show me round) and know that I have still got a bargain and an unique hotel that is completely different to any other that I have previously visited.", "Date": "January 13, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Yerevan, Armenia", "Title": "\u201cMany thanks\u201d", "Author": "anna k", "ReviewID": "UR119594676", "Content": "I would like to express my gratitude to St Anna hotel for their kind hospitality, where you can feel real Venetian atmosphere. The hotel is really nice, furnished with old Venetian stile. The place is idyllic, because it is situated very near to St Marco square, and the same time far from touristic noise. The staff is extremely kind and helpful, everything is very clean, breakfast is very fresh and nice.

It's cheap (you don't get many Venetian hotel rooms for 50 euros a night) and adequate, so was perfect for our purposes. A travel cot was provided for our baby, the room was cleaned and the towels changed every day, the air conditioning was set at the perfect level to stay on continuously throughout our stay, and the owner and his mum were friendly and courteous without being intrusive (OK they don't speak English - but you are in Italy!). The drawbacks are the breakfast (excellent coffee but rubbish food) and the noise - we were adjacent to a room sleeping 6, and these 6 people didn't appear to want to sleep but to talk when they got back to their room late at night, and we could hear every word! The outside space is not maximised for use by hotel guests, but the easy chairs outside the hotel room were ideal for us to relax in when our baby was taking a nap. The hotel is in the Castello part of Venice, just off the bustling Via Garibaldi with its selection of shops, bars and restaurants (handy for getting a decent breakfast!). It is a 10-minute walk from the Giardini vaporetto stop, where you can easily get to St Marks and the Lido. You have to be back at the hotel by 1.00 a.m. as you are not given a key to the hotel. Overall it is a good, cheap place to stay if all you want is a decent room to stay in without paying too much for it.", "Date": "July 15, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "2.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "bruxelles", "Title": "\u201cA pity! This could be a better place!\u201d", "Author": "Loubat", "ReviewID": "UR5609758", "Content": "We wanted a hotel in Venice and we got it. This was August 6 and 7, 2006. Location is a long walk from San Marco but that's fine. Its in a quiet area, almost residential. Getting there was manageable - one boat ride from Piazzale Roma. What exasperated me and my companions is the overall lack of hospitality in this hotel and the lack of initiative to make guests feel a bit better, especially when all these could be done at no or little costs. First, its an old house. No problem with that. But, its like a huge entrep\u00c3\u00b4t of old, discarded furniture. There were furniture covered in plastic at the private patio (which could have been converted into a nice area with tables and chairs and parasols), overstuffed sofas covered in faded cloths at the first floor sort of lobby (which could be easily converted into a nice sitting room by simply choosing the right furniture and removing everything else - its a pity, those Murano candelabras are not put in better view or value), and more furniture under the staircase. The very small lobby at the ground floor is dark. Breakfast room is also dark, with one light not working. They don't even bother to update the wall clock. Breakfast is stripped to a minimum - one fresh roll, one butter and two croissants or toasts in plastic wrappers, coffee or tea or chocolate. And its only from 8-9. There is almost nobody to talk to or ask questions except the old lady who opens the door and who only speaks Italian. Acoustics are not very good neither. We can hear the other room, the bathroom and the church bells just beside. Welcome is not very warm and the impression we got is once we have paid and received our keys, we our left on our own. Okey, I must say that its generally very clean and the rooms are spacious, clean bedsheets and fluffy towels, firm beds, shampoos and soaps included.", "Date": "August 14, 2006"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Locanda Sant'Anna", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g187870-d621210-Reviews-Locanda_Sant_Anna-Venice_Veneto.html", "Price": "$90 - $185*", "Address": "<address class=\"addressReset\"><span rel=\"v:address\"><span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">C.te del Bianco</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:postal-code\">269 30122</span> <span property=\"v:locality\">Venice</span></span>, <span class=\"country-name\" property=\"v:country-name\">Italy</span> </span></span></address>", "HotelID": "621210", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/ProviderThumbnails/dirs/62/50/625048a2c08e5f130ebcd1a056d297991large.jpg"}}
