I came to do a course and I knew nobody in Montreal but I found friends fast thanks to the people working at the hotel who were like travel guides for me! :) Like most reviews I'm reading, I wasn't expecting much because it was so cheap.. but the area is amazing, it is heart of Montreal, the people who work there are super friendly and helpful, the manager is a sweetheart and the girl who works days is SUPER nice!! There is someone at the front desk 24h, they just got a nice spa which I didn't get to use yet, but maybe next time I'll get a manicure. Anyway, the rooms are VERY CLEAN, big, modern, I love the exposed brick walls, they look so classy, and the tis are all flat screen, everything is newly renovated and looks really nice! The cleaning ladies are very friendly too and I just felt SO SAFE staying there, especially considering the fact that I was completely alone. There's no room service or fancy lobby (actually the stairs look really sketchy when you first walk in but once you're past reception it's like the place transforms into an art gallery or something (although they do have some pretty nice - and I hear expensive artwork -in the reception area, but this place is a gem and for the price and location it is a deal anyway, but the rooms are so much nicer than a lot of other places I've stayed at that were more expensive. I love this place so much I want to go back, because it really felt like home!

I don't mind that there is a sex shop next door or homeless begging for money because this is downtown.. you're going to find them everywhere. There is also a corner store and a great chain restaurant within 10 steps of the hotel doors. In 5 minutes walking time you can be at the metro station, Place des Arts, shopping mall, grocery store and Chinatown.. I must recommend a bakery called Harmonie, they have delicious chicken teriyaki buns. You can easily locate this century old hotel by it's dark red sign on Rue St Catherine. Open the front doors to see the steep staircase leading you to the lobby. You'll be greeted by friendly bi-lingual receptionists who are here 24/7. The lobby has a cozy fireplace, bathroom, large metro and city maps, ATM (which was not working during our stay) and luggage room (which we used both before and after our stay without problems). The studio rooms are in the left wing of the building, through a small yellow hallway. Reminded me very much of a bachelor apartment. First impressions: painted light yellow, wooden floors, lovely high ceilings, three large windows (facing onto dirty roof) and lack of artwork. Small, basic room with double bed, sitting chair, small kitchen table, full fridge, stove, cupboard space and basic kitchen amenities. With a closer look you can tell the room was in need of some TLC.. for example the small stains on the walls or marker written on the blankets. Bathroom was very small with full bathtub, noisy fan, lots of towels and we had basic bathroom amenities in the mirror cupboard. There were extra pillows, a blanket and a cot located in the closet. There is also controlled heating in the room which I found quite handy. I would probably stay in a different room category should I choose to stay here again. The rooms with the exposed brick look much nicer. The website does indicate that there are both smoking and non smoking rooms available. There are no balconies/terraces.

PROS: - Cost ($75 plus taxes for 2 nights through Booking.com) - Location, yes it was in the seedier part of town but Montreal has really aggressive homeless people everywhere so you can't really avoid them. Hotel is located by grocery store, convenience stores, restaurants, bus stop, Metro station, short walk to nicer parts, not too far from Old Montreal. Because of the location, there is a bit of noise coming from the street (if you want quiet, don't stay downtown!), didn't bother me much expect for the crazy guy who played his stupid drum (yes, one drum) for 15mins outside the door. - Clean. I was scared of using the shared bathrooms but it was practically spotless. There were 3 on my floor and I never had to wait to use one of them. I barely even saw any people using them. - Room. Also very clean, towels & bedding were provided, a sink was provided in the room, lots of mirrors (for ladies with hair duties), exposed brick, high ceilings, ceiling fan. It was 20 degrees (celsius) when I went and the room stayed cool. CONS: - Check-in was fast and efficient but receptionist didn't really show me where the room or bathrooms were, had to figure it out myself. - TV was not working properly, asked reception staff (there only seemed to be one staff at a time) to have a look at it, he did and said there's nothing he can do. (What's the point of advertising you have flatscreens, when they don't work?) - No soap in the shared bathrooms. - Massive rip in the screen of the window; if a large bird wanted to fly into the room, it probably could have gone through that hole. - Too many stairs. Wasn't really a problem with me since my luggage was light and I was on the 2nd floor (although, it really was the 3rd) but could be a problem with some. - Noise coming from the upstairs room. Not sure if there was construction going on, or honeymooners who didn't take a break... - Reception did not have maps available for guests Overall, this is a budget hotel so expect a budget hotel, but a very convenient, clean, and pleasantly surprising budget hotel.

The Wi-Fi worked very well, even for Skype calls. But the room was too bright, even at night, I think they need to get better curtains! The staff was not very nice.

The staff did everything they could to make the customers happy and it was a wonderful trip because of that. Location: The metro is right there if you have a longer distance to go, but it is also walking distance to the busier parts of town. The metro is wonderful, by the way. very clean and very efficient and you don't feel like as much like a sardine as you do in NYC. The Room: The room we had was obviously an old apartment that was renovated, so I loved that we had a fridge and a freezer for our drinks (we had gone F1 weekend, so keeping a cooler with drinks was much cheaper) as well as our own bathroom (which is hard to find in this price range in an old city like Montreal). Parking: There is a lot right next to the hotel but it isn't free (i believe it was 10$), but there is also a parking garage in walking distance that was a little cheaper. WiFi: its is available to guests and when your not from Canada, its wonderful to have a hotel that offers that so that you don't get charged with outrageous roaming data charges. Warning: Just be aware that Montreal is all hills and stairs (it is a mountain). The only way to get to the lobby was to go up a flight of stairs.

We had tickets to a multi-day concert festival nearby at the Metropolis, and could walk there in two minutes, which was a major plus for us! The mall, complete with grocery store was just a short walk West and wasn't too far for us to walk right down to the waterfront. The subway station (St.Lauent) was very close as well, so if you wanted to venture further than walking distance it would be quite easy. The building across the street, and a lot of St.Catherine were under construction, so there was a little bit of construction noise, but it wasn't very noticeable to us. I guess whatever goes into the building across the street might make a difference as well. Staff The staff at reception were very friendly and courteous. The reception is manned 24hours, and you don't get in unless they buzz you, so we felt very safe about that. Room We stayed in one of their studio apartments because we wanted the kitchen facilities. It was on the second floor, and you have to go up and down stairs to get there, which is not a problem for us - good exercise ;) The room was VERY clean, even the bathroom (other than the shower curtain, but that's forgivable).

Had a great kitchen with all pots, pans, dishes, cutlery included. The kitchen had a full oven/stove, microwave, full size fridge/freezer, toaster, kettle and coffee maker.

The old flooring of the stairway and the hallways is very creaky, and even respectful guests make quite a bit of noise moving around. The noise made by the \"woo girls\" who seemed to be the most common hotel guests here was unavoidable. They sat around the halls and talked loudly to all hours. Not to mention the pervasive smell of cigarettes when you're trying to sleep (woo girls on the fire escape? coming up from the street? we weren't sure). There was no air conditioning in our room, so our only choice to avoid sweltering at night (bear in mind it's been a very cool spring - cold on the street) was to leave the street facing window open. Worst couple of nights' sleep I've ever had. On the plus side, the staff is generally pleasant, the place is clean and the laundry service was punctual. But the price we paid wasn't any cheaper than an HI and I've slept far better at any other hostel I could name. L'abri translates as \"shelter\" which was not our experience at all. We didn't feel sheltered at all from the noise of the street, the cigarette smoke, rowdy guests and creaky building.

First, the positives: its located right in the heart of Montreal, in a very lively neighborhood. Given its location, the rates are really good. Our room (a small self-contained apartment with a small kitchen) was clean and nicely decorated and had everything you might possibly need. The one big downside was that the room directly faced the street and the old windows didn't provide very good sound insulation. There was a lot of street noise from people walking around until the wee hours of the morning. Also, the street in front of the hotel, two sides had been closed off for road construction, and every morning some big piece of machinery would start tearing up the road right next to the hotel, scooping up big chunks of asphalt and loudly dumping them into a dump truck. So between the loud people outside until 5 a.m. or so and the road construction that started at 7 a.m., we didn't get all that much sleep. We would have requested a different room, but we know the hotel was full, so we suffered through it. In retrospect, I think I would have looked for a hotel that was somewhat outside the city but close to a metro station.

The staff is absolutely friendly and helpful, I found their English to be perfect to passable (Unfortunately I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve forgotten all my high school French).

The Abri du Voyageur is definitely running a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153hot sheet\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd operation (but not a brothel as one reviewer described). Mid- level prostitutes (not high price escorts but not crack ho\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s either) do bring in their clients for use of some rooms on an hourly (or less) basis. These rooms though are right near the front desk and access to them is directly to the lobby where guests check in and out.

Also if you do see them it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s only in this lobby, nowhere else on the three floors of rooms. Morning, days and early evenings they aren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t around.

We were only able to book a smoking room, but didn't smell anything as I'm very sensitive to cigarette smoke. The room was located on the second floor. Check in was easy and the person at the front desk polite. They recommended we park a a garage about a 10 minute walk. We would have had an easier time parking our car but the International Jazz Festival was basically at their front door. (GREAT location is you're looking to go to this). The room over looked the main street, which worried me due to the noise outside. However, the windows are double glass - we couldn't hear a thing! The room was really cute too, with exposed brick, and vintage looking furniture. The bed was comfy and clean. There was a sink in the room too, which made our stay easier with shared bathrooms. There were 3 really nice bathrooms on our floor. Only on our last day when we were checking out did I have to use one of the bathrooms further away from our room. We kept using the one right outside our door. Note that the other bathrooms were about 10 feet further, so its really not a big deal. The maids were really polite and offered fresh towels every day. They even provide little soaps, shampoo and conditioner - something we didn't use since we brought our own. but it goes to show that they're trying to be a nice little hotel. It was definitely a step above a hostel. I really enjoyed my stay here and would recommend going.

No breakfast, but then so many food places nearby and having a kitchenette that's no problem. The supermarkets are expensive compared to the UK but wonderful produce. Try St. Huberts for chicken dishes and in the local take aways poutine and beaver tails as (high calorie!) snacks - yum! Pitta pit is great for sandwiches and even subway is way better than the uk version. Micobreweries for real ales and Fouffes for a rock nightclub. Fab.

I am a (young) 45 year old female business owner that is in shape. You'll understand shortly why this info is important. I found this hotel on the Web. I shop first location then for price when looking for a hotel. I dont like spending a lot of money on a hotel room because you only sleep and shower there (at least that's all I usually do!!!) This place was less than half the price than the other hotels. And in my opinion well worth it. I did read the other reviews on TripAdvisor and I want to address both the bad and good that other people had to say. Its always intersting that people can have such conflicting opinions but be in the exact same place. Some times even at the same time!!! I wanted a hotel that was close to everything so I could walk. This hotel is centrally located: it is about a 10 - 15 minute walk to Old Montreal, 10 minute walk to the Quarter Latin/Chinatown and 10-15 walk the other direction to all the shopping. (OMGoddess is there SHOPPING! it is dizzying!) For what I wanted to do on this first trip to Montreal this hotel was perfectly located. Now - just where it is located: right on St Catherine and yes, people, there is a sex shop next door (I took a picture for you to see). And an Opera across the street. And Plaza de la Arts on the next block. If that is going to freak you out then stay someplace else. Yes, people brought children into the hotel. We all lived. The reception desk is on the second floor. You do have to go up two flights of stairs to get into the hotel. You will have to go up two or three flights of stairs to get to your room. This was not a big deal to me as I exercise for a living. To many people it would be a big deal to not have an elevator. I suggest you start a regular exercise program - then you'd have no issues with a few stairs. The room was clean. I did a shared bathroom which was clean as well. And so was the bathroom below which I used if someone was in the one next to my room. I would stay here again if I came to Montreal. The staff was very nice and friendly. And no, the place was NOT A BROTHEL. If it was I certainly didn't notice. And it certainly didn't affect (effect?) me if it was. If you want a fancy hotel, with an elevator, a spacious room with expensive linens, lotions and potions and fancy soaps, etc. this is NOT it. But you aren't paying for that either. So please don't complain if that isn't what you get. HELLO!!!!!!! Parking was not available on site. There is a $10 outside lot you can park in. I have a BMW so I chose to park in the Plaza De Arts secure underground lot for $15 a day located 1 1/2 blocks away. (Note: you cannot get into this parking area on Sundays to park but you can get out!! CASH ONLY) You can unload your luggage in front of the hotel then go park your car. Be sure to eat at Boccacino's on McGill College - awesome food both breakfast, lunch and dinner. And right next door is Les 3 Brausseurs (spelling) great beer and great food! Old Montreal is really beautiful. I enjoyed the shopping on rue St Paul much more than all of the junk stores in many of the underground areas. Sitting in the park is quite pleasant. I can't tell you about nightlife because I have been there, done that 15 years ago and I'm not interested in doing it again. Montreal is an extremely easy city to navigate. I used a map.

Yes, the bathrooms are shared, but I have never once felt that they were unsanitary or lacked \"hot water\", etc. I find that this hotel is fantastic for people of all ages and backgrounds, and since many European travellers stay here, it is a fantastic opportunity to meet new people from all over the world. The staff at the Abri du Voyageur hotel are fantastic--from the front desk staff, Carole, Nicolas and Diane in particular to the cleaning staff, Sylvie, Veronica, etc. As you can see, the staff put in the extra effort to make you feel like the Abri du Voyageur is a home away from home--so much so that they consistently remember my name when I walk in the door, ask what I was doing during the day, and make suggestions of daily and evening activities. Yes, the Abri du Voyageur is located in an area that historically has been rated as a \"red light district\"..but the area is changing drastically. I've actually enjoyed staying here because this area has been extensively written about by famous Quebec playwrite Michel Tremblay as \"La Main\"...this is a very historical area. With the changes in the area, this hotel is located right in the middle of the entertainment district. The last time I stayed here, I decided to stay in one of the studio apartments. How lucky was I to be able to walk out of the building and right into the middle of Les Francofolies, a French Canadian musical festival...right outside the door! I really don't understand people's lower ratings of this hotel. As I have said before, this hotel has a very European feel about it..and it is inexpensive.

He booked everything and assured me it was going to be a great place. My biggest thing is cleanliness, and this place did not deliver. I was grossed out first by the washroom. We could hear people having sex (loud and clear) through the paper-thin walls. When we found out our stove in the kitchenette didn't work, we asked to be moved (we had to go down the hall, down the stairs, out the building, around the corner, up the stairs and waited to be buzzed in to the lobby. You know the hotel is in an unsafe area when you have to be buzzed in to the lobby during rush hour). We were given a new room a floor up from the first. So back around the corner, etc, etc. When we got up to the new room, the bathroom was just as grungy and the bed had pubic hairs in it. We again demanded a new room. The third room was down the hall from the original. When we tried the door, it had been chained from the inside and someone said \"Hello?\" from the dark. At that point I decided we were finding a new hotel. Being Valentine's Day, we had to stay there one night as there were no other rooms to be had at a reasonable rate. The night we slept at this place I kept all my daytime clothes on for fear of touching the linens - so much for a romantic Valentine's Day! The next day we booked into the Travelodge, which was slightly smaller, but had the cleanliness standard I expect. It was only $100 more for the week and still close to everything. And best of all, we weren't given an already-occupied room! Moral of the Story: DO Believe the bad reviews.

The hotel is in a terrible area, but is walking distance away from most of Montreal's main sites (Old Montreal, the port, Chinatown, the Palais de Congres, etc). The bad: The neighbourhood is dangerous. Homeless people congregated on the steps of the hotel all the time and I had to step around them to get in. There are two nightclubs very close to the hotel, and the noise kept me up all night. The walls are very thin and I could hear everyone walking by and the person in the next room opening and closing his drawers, watching TV (my set didn't work because the reception was terrible), and talking on his cell phone. The bathrooms were gungy. There's two per floor. There's no elevator, so that's something to take into consideration if you want to stay here, and I also advise you to bring your own alarm clock if you want to be woken up on time.

I stayed in the suites section and had a large bedroom, kitchenette (with all appliances and conveniences - for those who want to shop and eat in occasionally), private bathroom and plenty of space. Portable air conditioner, TV included, no telephone and no internet capability in room - some kind of intercom was on wall but didn't have to use. Room was very clean and quiet for the most part. Not straightened up one day during my 9-day stay. Finding hotel was easy once you understand all the one-ways and maneuver the traffic (which is menacing). Arrival was hurried as parking in front of hotel is limited, then you walk up flight of stairs and quickly check in. Suites are around the coroner, and parking (private but very inexpensive) is a block behind. Once you get parked, you have to bring luggage back to the suites (roadwork going on and confusing entrance). I had a room on the 3rd floor and the climb was daunting. If you are elderly or have problems getting around, this is not the ideal setup for you. Parking was okay on weekends, however, weekday parking filled quickly with people who worked in the area. Sometimes have to leave key and have attendant park when space opens up. Not a big deal though. Conveniently located in \"center\" of town within walking distance to China Town, Old Town, and most \"tourist\" sites. Walking distance to all kinds of restaurants and major malls nearby. Yes, the area does look kinda seedy, but I felt pretty safe, and I wandered about all hours of day and night.
