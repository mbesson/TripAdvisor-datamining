There were bugs in the room and I had bites on me after staying there one night I ended up staying in another room which wasn't much better. I bathroom was filthy and the toilet was in the middle of the shower. I ended up putting one of the twoels on the floor and standing on it", "Date": "Aug 29, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR176170856", "Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Business service": "1", "Cleanliness": "1", "Check in / front desk": "1", "Overall": "1", "Value": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "2"}, "Author": "smileySydney"}, {"Content": "The worst hotel I have ever stayed in!!! I recently came back from a 3 week tour of the Mediterranean and this was one stop on our tour I will not forget. I am not a picky person and when traveling Europe I expect no frills. However, this so called 3 star hotel should be avoided. The hotel is situated outside of the core of Florence in a remote neighbourhood. The hotel is gated by a 12 foot high fence with 4 spikes nestled on top. The shower consists of a nozzle, toilet, curtain and floor drain. There is no berm or physical wall to keep the shower water in the shower. After every shower the bathroom is flooded. This layout was consistent with all rooms in this hotel (as witnessed in other tour members rooms). And yes... I said toilet!! The toilet is literally in the shower and impossible to keep dry if showering. The location is less than desirable, however a bus stop beside the hotel will take you into the core of Florence (until 11pm). The only positive was the grocery store beside the hotel, which is stocked with excellent wine, meats and cheeses. When taking into account the money spent on buses and taxis you would be better off staying closer to the downtown area in a more expensive hotel.", "Date": "Sep 23, 2005", "ReviewID": "UR681044465", "Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "2", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "1", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "mitchellja"}, {"Content": "Nice The Hotel Autopark is not in an industrial area. It is in the middle of a suburb. Make sure you take your confirmation info with rates on it. Otherwise, you will be charged the curernt rate. We were there during the Fashion show season. The rate on the room was over double what was on my confirmation sheet. Since I had my sheet we did not pay the unbelievable rate of 300 euros per night. Arrive during the day when the manager is there. He does speak English and understands the confirmation sheet with your rate. There is a grocery store behind the hotel. Buy whatever you need there. Otherwise, the prices at the bars - if they are open- is very expensive. There is a bus stop near the hotel that will get you downtown and back. When coming back, just stay on the bus to the stop where you were picked up. It is the last stop and the bus waits there. You can purchase bus tickets at the hotel. 1 euro each way. No need to search for a place to buy a bus ticket.The only thing that was strange here was the bathroom. The shower was in the corner of the bathroom next to the toilet. Just put the mat down and take your shower. Also, the bath towels were sheets not terry cloth. But they were clean and did the job.", "Date": "Aug 6, 2005", "ReviewID": "UR788979523", "Ratings": {"Service": "-1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "-1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "3", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "-1", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "dakbg73"}, {"Content": "El peor hotel en el que he estado   showReview(19485211, 'full');", "Date": "Aug 28, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR774959097", "Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Business service": "1", "Cleanliness": "1", "Check in / front desk": "2", "Overall": "1", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "1"}, "Author": "Anjocava"}, {"Content": "Nunca volveria alli   showReview(10058683, 'full');", "Date": "Oct 9, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR464044502", "Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "1", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "1", "Value": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "2"}, "Author": "LUNA27"}], "HotelInfo": {"HotelURL": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g187895-d577945-r19879172-Hotel_Autopark-Florence_Tuscany.html", "HotelID": "577945", "Price": "Unkonwn"}}
