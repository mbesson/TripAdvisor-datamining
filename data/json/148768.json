There are some good walking trails for exploring. We both liked it a lot and I even asked her to marry me while staying there, so it was a very special stay. Fast forward to 2010, we decided to go there for another 2 nights stay. It was a little busier this time, but not too loud. The first night we ate, they didn't have my first few choices off the menu. The second night, we went to the resteraunt and it was locked. I asked they lady at the desk and she said that they weren't going to be open because they didn't have many guest. We were told to drive to one of the towns to find food. My wife and I both thought they could have warned us, as it was already late and hard to make last minute changes when you have a baby.

It is fairly dismal in some respects, and stellar in others. Service: The establishment seems understaffed. There were gaps in the published menu and what food was really available. The food service was often behind schedule in starting for breakfast or dinner, with slow service. The breakfasts were fairly good, but the dinners were just passable insofar as table fare is concerned. Accomodations: The pool is usable, but maintenance is poor. It is up to the guest to remove the leaves and insects floating on the surface. The water was clear and cool, and the pool is large enough for lap swimming. The rooms have no air conditioning, there are no insect screens on the windows, and the bathroom facilities are aged and in need of some repair. However, the facilities did work. Cleanliness was okay and the rooms were cleaned and serviced during my absence while I was on business in Maricao during the daytime hours. I recommend walking around the compound and selecting the cabin/room you will stay in, as some are near sources of noise (like gathering locations for local parties) and others are near hotel garbage storing sites located behind some cabins. Location: This is where the hotel shines. It is on a cleared hillside in the tropical forest. The immediate grounds have nice paths and little gardens. There is a path following the periphery of the compound clearing boundary with the forest that is maintained, allowing one to treck on the forest edge. The path leaves the compound grounds near an old coffee processing machine, circles down near the tropical forest for about a quarter mile or so, traverses along the lower slope of the compound hillside and circles up hillside to re-enter the compound near the kitchen building. There are all types of insects, spiders, birds and lizards. I found a spider that has defied classification for a year. There was also a lizard lying dead near the office steps with a spider in its mouth, an apparent dinner that did not go so well. A dead mongoose on the path provided testimony to the mammalian creatures inhabiting in the area. Atmosphere: This place is reminiscent of the 1800s colonial compounds seen in old pictures. The setting, especially when in the vicinity of the cabins immediately adjacent to the restaurant building, seems to bring one back in time to a pastoral society where life is slower and the bustle of the modern world is missing. For someone used to camping and seeking a rustic and secluded night or two with a real bed, running water and available services, this place is great. I worked in Maricao during the day, but had I the time, a great day could have been had with an early morning walk along the path (I did this), a day of reading and viewing from the restaurant building veranda and an evening swim (I did this) before retiring early. I would recommend bringing a good book or two and a pair of binoculars. This would allow a person to have two or three days of peaceful, introspective adventure.", "Date": "September 30, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "1", "Check in / front desk": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "New York", "Title": "\u201cThis is one of those places that you leave behind as soon as you can.\u201d", "Author": "RobertGiacommetti", "ReviewID": "UR7671642", "Content": "I had been to this place about 15 years ago, and unfortunately, the place has become a dump.
