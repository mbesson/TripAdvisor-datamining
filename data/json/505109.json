The helpful staff and the hospitality were paramount to our Venetian visit. Every day a wonderfully smiling face came up with great sug-gestions for restaurants and the beach. The room was very nice and impeccably clean and we loved the wonderful buffet breakfast and the round the clock reception. The Lido surely was soothing and relaxing after a full day of walking in crowded Venice, and the beach just across the hotel street was exactly the relaxing and very quiet rest we needed, basking in the silence, the sand and the sea. We fully, fully reccomend it!

Italy. Dates: May 9 to May 17, 2008 We were delighted with our stay at the two-star Riva Mare, located on the Venice Lido. It is a charming, intimate and family operated boutique hotel. Our room was comfortable and tastefully furnished with a modern ensuite bathroom. A sumptuous continental breakfast is served buffetstyle in a large, light and airy room, that opens to an outdoor terrace. We enjoyed breakfast inside and then took our delicious coffee outside to drink in the shade of the awning and evergreens. The Lido jetty is just a short bus or taxi ride away and allows for an expedient watertaxi transfer to all that Venice and the surrounding islands have to offer. The frontdesk sells transportation tickets with great maps and suggestions for the best trattoria to have lunch or dinner. After a good sightseeing day come home to the hotel Riva Mare and enjoy a refreshing campari on the terrace served from the lobby bar. For us, this stay was everything we could have wished for to capture a delightful and memorable Venetian experience.", "Date": "June 1, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "4", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Nottingham, England", "Title": "\u201cNice clean place near a great beach\u201d", "Author": "Jasperdog_7", "ReviewID": "UR8508304", "Content": "We stayed here for 7 nights in Aug 07. The staff were friendly and spoke English. The room overlooked the tennis club and had 2 small balconies. It was clean, with parquet flooring, and sheets and towels changed often. The bathroom was small but modern. The beach is only about 50m away, and is sandy with a shallow slope into the water, with lifeguards present, so very safe. The only criticism of the beach is that it is closed from 7p.m. to 9a.m. every night, so romantic moonlit walks are out! Overall, a great holiday, with the hustle and bustle of Venice close but easily left behind for a quiet couple of hours on the beach.", "Date": "August 26, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Pilsen", "Title": "\u201cBeautiful holidays with children\u201d", "Author": "Michael003", "ReviewID": "UR8504104", "Content": "A small hotel,not far from beach.Very kindly people,all services in perfect quality.We were there with two children and hope,that we can come back here next year.", "Date": "August 25, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "3", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "3", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "London, England", "Title": "\u201cGood value Hotel!\u201d", "Author": "Travel_With_Dele", "ReviewID": "UR8405192", "Content": "Good value... very friendly family run establishment.
