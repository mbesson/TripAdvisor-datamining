{"Reviews": [{"Content": "Below average :( Location ; not so good. It is not located right infront of the beach. Its right behind a hotel. The main entrance of Harris Kuta is facing the backyard of a hotel which i think its weird. About 5 to 10 mins walk from the hotel entrance to the kuta road/beach. Hotel looks clean but the room looks old. The tv is smaller than any hotel i've seen. The shower head looks old and rusty, tub were not well maintain. Very limited toiletries provided. Only 1 small bottle of shampoo and shower cream each which is not enough for 2 ppl. 1 soap bar. And 1 shower cap. When i call and ask for a comb, they said is chargeable and cost around 20,000 Rps. Don't make sense at all, 20,000 Rps just for a comb?!!! Its ridiculous. Staff were friendly upon check in. But had a long face when checking out. She don't even smile or look at us when she talk. How rude. Breakfast were ok. But almost the same dishes every morning. Planning for a trip to Bali? Harris Kuta, not recommended. Mercure Hotel is far better with good location to all local attraction and restaurants there.", "Date": "Nov 22, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR367604730", "Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "2", "Overall": "2", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "1"}, "Author": "dumpling4"}, {"Content": "Great Hospitality       pool view 2", "Date": "Jul 9, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR801108675", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "kltraveler08"}, {"Content": "Harris Kuta was OK but could be better. From all the hype about the friendliness of the native people we found the first couple of days to be frustrating. The desk staff was only cordial. The guys who stand out front to greet and help you were more friendly. We didn't get our wake up call so we could be on time for our first day of touring. We notified the desk and then the tour guide who also talked to the desk. They claimed we just didn't answer our phone. It didn't get fixed and we had to get pretty pushy to get it fixed. There was also a funny water running sound when the a/c ran but they also fixed that by the second day.The breakfast buffet was disappointing at first but we found that out on the patio they will fix eggs to your order and had fresh pancakes or french toast. Stayed 5 days and found it to be decent for the location and the price.

This hotel is perfect for tourists who are in budget but still want to have an awesome hotel in Kuta area. The location is not as great as other hotels in Kuta, but its just about 5 minutes drive away from the crowded, famous Kuta Beach. So, location shouldn't be a problem, as along the street of Kuta, many cafes, restaurants, shops are located. Nearby this hotel, a 24/7 McDonalds located. The decoration is fantastic! Its so refreshing and modern. The welcome drink is also a nice touch. Service is excellent, the staff is helpful and very friendly. The room was nice, my room has a back door to the swimming pool are, as the hotel isnt so big, it feels like having the hotel! I went there during the euphoria time of FIFA World Cup, and at night, at the swimming pool cafe, they set huge screen for showing the games, so we could share our euphoria and having a great time socializing with other guests. The swimming pool is not bad, children loved it. They also have children playhouse, a nice one. The only terrible thing about this hotel when I stayed was (maybe I was just not lucky) I found a CENTIPEDE on the bathtub!!! That was super eerie! Luckily, the centipede was dead I guess, so I called the staff to clean it, that was just a super terrible experience, and that time I really had to use the bathroom, so I seek the public bathroom in the lobby and found the public bathroom was quite awful. Not smelly, but the door was quite disgusting to me. Huh.. But I think you really shouldnt worry about this. The hotel was super clean, besides this incident. Then, at night, when other guests return to their room, when they make a lot of noise, it can disturb your privacy. One night, I got back to my room with a lot number of people, and we were talking, and joking, and laughing like crazy, so the guest next door got out to tell us that he was disturbed. Haha. But from my personal experience, the room was great, I never got disturbed from noises out of my room.", "Date": "Feb 19, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR325017790", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "4", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "3", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "fredric_fd"}, {"Content": "excellent decor and service i had stayed before in Harris Batam, so when the time came to book my stay in Bali, and the Hard Rock was out of my budget, i booked Harris Kuta instead for 4 nights. from when we arrived at the airport at night, the hotel transfer van was already waiting for us, and there were no problems with check-in. in fact, though most hotels will normally allow guests to have only 1 key, Harris allowed us to have as many keys as we wanted. However, as we found out the next morning, one of the keys did not work properly, and the front desk staff were happy to fix the problem.overall colour scheme of the hotel (green and orange) was very vibrant and cheerful. we had no problems with the room or the bathroom, and had no complaints about lack of amenities as we only used the electric kettle to boil drinking water. at the beginning of our stay, we had a small ant problem, which was rectified by housekeeping the next afternoon, when we were out of the hotel. the beds were a bit soft for our preferences though, making it a little difficult to get to sleep. buffet breakfast was standard, nothing impressive, but still satisfactory. the small pancakes and omelettes were better than the slightly bland rice/noodle dishes served at breakfast (however, the nasi goreng ala carte was delicious and they served my daughter as many of the prawn crackers as she wished). i would say that the design/decor of the restaurant had a larger impression on me than the food.pool was alright, clean and large. my toddler enjoyed the stone slide in the kids' pool. however my teenage daughter fell and scraped her knee quite badly on the stone wall bordering one side of the pool- if you have kids make sure they do not have any similar accidents as the cut was quite deep and resulted in a scar. the staff were very prompt about the first aid kit that we requested though.one thing about the hotel is that they had shower rooms inside the waiting room (which smelled faintly of cigarette smoke), which we used after our surfing lessons to rinse off all the sand. other guests might have complained about the walkway leading from the beach to the main lobby, which, true, is not well lit at night, but the security post at the gate is very efficient (the guards will check all cars that go in and out). also there is a shuttle going from the hotel to the main shopping area, but if you miss the shuttle, it is not too far to walk, about 10 to 15 mins.overall, Harris Kuta is a good deal if you are not going to be staying in the room for most of the day, and if you are used to hard beds you might have some difficulties sleeping. location of the hotel is good and close enough to anything you might need (there is a mcdonald's nearby). the service makes up for anything the hotel might lack, though. i am planning a trip in march 2008 and will definitely consider Harris again.", "Date": "Dec 12, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR894512262", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "ilovetheopera"}, {"Content": "Simple, Unique,Friendly.. but dont accept a room with connecting door!
