I am shocked that it would be classified as three stars - one star would be overrating this place. Had we not been concerned that we wouldn't be able to find another hotel during the height of the tourist season -- we would have walked out five seconds after walking in. First of all, the hotel wasn't even open and there was a sign on the door to go down the street to another hotel (owned by the same people). The front desk employee was not helpful and almost rude when we asked questions. The breakfast room was crowded and very uncomfortable to sit in -- I HIGHLY RECOMMEND AGAINST THIS PLACE....", "Date": "September 17, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "1", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Aberdeen", "Title": "\u201cDisgusting\u201d", "Author": "Joyce12", "ReviewID": "UR7838135", "Content": "How this hotel has any stars I fail to understand. How it can even be classed as a hotel is a joke. On entering the place it is filthy and cluttered. There was a sewerage smell in the stair up to our room. The carpet in the room was filthy, taps loose in the basin. Your wardrobe was 3 hooks with 3 hangers. Basically it was disgusting and so bad that we couldn't even stay there for 1 night.

The 24 hour reception was good and made it feel secure. Staff were friendly. Breakfast was adequate though we chose to eat elsewhere after the first morning.

The bathroom is clean, spacious, confortable. The window is big with a nice view to the street and to the channel. Disadvantages: there is no cupboard for the clothes, only 4 hangers on the wall.
