From the moment I arrived at the hotel, I was treated like royalty. The room was incredible! Wood floors, floor to ceiling windows with electric drapes, top of the line electronics, iPad (used to communicate with the hotel for room service, valet, housekeeping and internet, etc) and iPod docking station, surround sound, extremely spacious, and beautiful decor. It seemed as though I was at a luxury high rise condo instead of a hotel. The staff was impeccable! They were friendly and went above and beyond to ensure I had everything I needed during my stay. Breakfast and a welcoming cocktail is included and they both were a nice benefit. There were so many things (pool, basketball, virtual bowling & skee ball, and spa) to do that I didn't want to leave the hotel. My expectations were far exceeded. The price is well worth it for this quality of hotel and Level service.", "Date": "March 20, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Tampa", "Title": "\u201cExcellent views, good service, valet needs work\u201d", "Author": "HVB", "ReviewID": "UR126406120", "Content": "We stayed here on Marriott points and were pleasantly upgraded at check in to a wonderful Junior Suite with amazing views (room 3826). Perhaps because my husband is elite with Marriott or that I mentioned it was his birthday in the email we received from the hotel a week prior to our arrival. The room was enormous and yes the water in the bathroom was pretty cool. The porter who brought our luggage showed me how to use the coffee machine, which made lovely coffee and the hotel was generous with giving at least 6 if not 8 coffee pods. I enjoyed several cups of coffee! The bathroom was large with a gorgeous light fixture and I enjoyed a bath in the immense tub after a long day of walking. We did not use the pool area although it was not very busy when we checked. The beds are comfortable of course. The ceilings reflect which was a little strange but not too detracting. The rooms are very clean and I loved the floor, it was wood! I hate hotel carpeting! The furniture was very comfortable and trendy looking at the same time. The little touches like Art books on display made this large room seem very friendly and homey. The ipad interface was interesting but I'd rather have a recommendation from a human as to things to do/ places to go, etc. We used it once to retrieve our car from the valet and it took 45 minutes to get our car. I was not happy at all. Valet is the only option. We did not make too much of a fuss about it though. When we got back to our room there was a small bottle of wine and chocolate covered strawberries with a Happy Birthday note for my husband which was a very nice touch, and also delicious. We highly enjoyed cocktails and dinner at db bistro moderne. I will review it separately but if you like good food it's worth it to go there. The noise in the room was negligible. I was concerned because the doors seem heavy and I thought they would slam but not once did I hear another guest. The welcome cocktail also came with some snacks in a nice lounge and the lady working there (I already forgot her name) was so delightful. When we mentioned we were heading out on a cruise the next day she offered to print us the weather forecasts for where we were going. The service level is outstanding. Everyone you encounter asks how your stay is and offers to help. The only weak link was the valet and expensive too at $35 per day! It's a great deal on points but we'd pay for a room on a return visit. It was an exceptional and unique hotel experience.", "Date": "March 20, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Charlotte, North Carolina", "Title": "\u201cBeautiful views with top notch room\u201d", "Author": "Joef22", "ReviewID": "UR125938329", "Content": "For starters if you have Marriott Rewards points this hotel is a must stay.

So smart of Marriott to pursue this niche boutique market, and launching a hotel in Miami was brilliant. You definitely do NOT feel like you are in a Marriott once you leave the lobby (the hotel is the top several floors of the JW Marriott on Biscayne Boulevard). It was exceptionally clean, which is no small feat with all the glass and stainless steel in the bathroom, and the basics as well as the other amenities were top notch. It can be a bit complicated to operate all of the technology - the alarm clock also turns off the t.v., which lives embedded into a wall until you invite it out with the touch of a button. The gym and other recreational options are also high end. We ordered room service on the hotel-provided iPad and were also able to use the iPad - which had a nice application installed that allowed us to easily request a taxi, call for our car, check in for flights, learn about local attractions, shopping, nightlife, restaurants, etc. The food was not exceptional as it almost seemed like the menu tries too hard to be avant garde, but it was fine and the welcome glass of champagne (one of many choices of welcome \"snacks\") was very nice. It is pricey but we used Marriott points to stay there - now that we know what we will \"get\", we are very likely to return. It is not near South Beach and is not a \"beach\" experience. It is a destination in itself and a perfect place to stay if you are just looking to take in Miami for a few days.", "Date": "January 9, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Chicago, Illinois", "Title": "\u201cI challenge you to set the alarm clock...\u201d", "Author": "gottdownunder", "ReviewID": "UR122696859", "Content": "You won't know how, but that's ok, you won't care.

It was simply perfect. Generally, when visiting Miami, we have stayed at the Ritz Carlton, Miami Beach. At first, we thought we would miss not being right on the beach, but, it turned out to be not that big of a deal. And frankly, we were so dazzled by all the technology and highly buffed wood in this suite, that we hardly noticed we weren't on the beach. If you were listening to me, you may have heard may say: \"I think this is the nicest hotel I have ever visited.\" Of course, we had the suite located on the 40th floor which over-looked Biscayne Bay on one side and magnificent city scapes on the other side--that made it very easy to forget what we didn't have. A bell hop led us up to the 39th floor reception area. Before not too long, we had complementary cocktails in our hands, and we were officially greeted by the hotel staff. Shortly afterwards, the conceirge led us to our suite, opened the door, and escorted us down a long entry corridor that also housed the half bath, and led to the living room. He immediately began a rehearsed script where he explained all the technology in the suite. He explained the B.O. televisions (there were 3 in the suite), the phone system, the stereo system, the electronic drapes, the electronically rotating tv stand, one of the 3 tvs hidden behind the bathroom mirror, the alarm clock that also doubled as a remote control for the bedroom television, the electronically colored and controlled bathroom faucets, and on and on! he also pointed out the jacuzzi tub and separate waterfall shower stall--everything done up in the richest brown marble (or granite, or whatever it was). There was also a security video screen on the door, and an electronic system integrated with the card key that turned on lights and signaled staff to enter the suite for servicing, or to stay away. There were also upgraded toilets (I believe Toto). There was so much going on that, at first it was a little intimadating and overwhelming--and fun!!! The suite was immaculately appointed and well thought out, from head to toe...just take my word for it. They did not miss a trick! Ultra modern, sleek and minimal, but, supple and rich, with buffed wood paneling everywhere, including the ceilings. So buffed that you could see yourself in it. We ate complementary breakfast in the 39th floor breakfast room, also beautifully decorated, every morning, surrounded by panoramic views of the city skyline and the waterways. the staff was delightful and well trained to accomodate guests' wishes and requests. They took really good care of us. I simply can't say enough about this experience. We truly enjoyed this experience from begining to end. We had dinner in the restaurant on the first floor--excellent. Sergio, the MBistro manager, noticed that we were not altogether pleased with all the selections on the menu, came over to find out what was going on. We explained that the menu in our suite was different than what was in the restaruant, and we had already decided what we wanted. He explained that they had just changed the menu, told us not to worry, and that he would take care of it---and he did. We bowled and played pool, and stuck our toes in the pool! We had messages at the spa. It was just great. We ended up spending a lot of time in the hotel because we were enjoying it so much. The only negative thing was staff was very slow at bringing ice. Then they would bring 4 or 5 buckets when they finally showed up, and they would also enter the suite before getting permission to do so. But, at the end of the day, these were both very small issues. This hotel is at the top of the list for us, and we will be returning soon.", "Date": "November 10, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Naples, Florida", "Title": "\u201cAbsolutely fabulous\u201d", "Author": "steven b", "ReviewID": "UR120355727", "Content": "What a find!

The bed was really comfortable with italian cotton sheeting. The bathroom had a large whirlpool bath, a separate large shower with overhead and wall shower heads. Really cool double sinks that lit the water coming out of the faucet either red or blue depending on the temperature plus a television behind the glass mirror. Ethan and Ryan at the concierge desk couldn't be more welcoming and helpful. The european breakfast was great, made even more enjoyable by the pleasant server Stephanie. These rooms on just 4 floors have their own bar, lounge and TV room areas should you not want to remain in your room. Also worth a mention is the exceptional cooking at the daniel butler restaurant. The $38 fixed price 3 course dinner is great value, again the waiters were first rate. The gym is very well equipped and it was great to watch the boats on the bay whilst on the running machines. The spa is also luxurious, Courtney a brilliant masseuse. I wish we could have stayed there longer. This is a hotel where paying that bit extra really is worth it.
