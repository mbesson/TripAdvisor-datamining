SERVICE - 5/5. Service was great. Nothing to complain about. Check-in was easy and fast. ROOM - 3.5/5. The room needs updating badly. The decor looks old, worn and from the 80s. The desk chair had rips in the leather and the bathroom needed re-grotting. Felt like a 3.5-4 star hotel. Wireless internet was at an additional charge (if not for my corporate rate) and local calls were also at a charge (though not much). Our room didn't have a view at all so our blinds were mostly closed. The room was fairly clean and was cleaned twice a day. VALUE - 3.5/5. With my corporate rate, they gave me a bottle of red wine and a bowl of fruit that was stocked daily. That was a nice, unexpecting touch.

The Dickens bar and restaurant downstairs at the hotel has sports TV, great food and service and a really bubbly atmosphere. Always crowded with expats, locals and tourists but not too crowded....just right! The rooms are compact but adequate and we usually stay in a Deluxe Harbour View room that gives a nightly 'light show' of the lit up buildings across the water in Kowloon. The hotel is in the heart of Causeway Bay shopping district and 100 metres from the MRT station. Restaurants are everywhere and Times Square has it all in terms of brand name shopping and the local shops do the rest.

Take advantage of turn down service. Fresh towels, water and a bathroom clean all part of the service. Breakfast at level one was very good. We paid extra however for Executive lounge on 31st Floor.

I very briefly popped down to the refurbished Dickens Bar and found it to be dark, cold and full of the same miserable and unhelpful staff on the planet.....I did a uturn and went straight up to the Terrace on the roof. This too however was a silly mistake as the bar staff here were totally incompetent!!!! Although the view was great (and the light show was taking place as we arrived) we were there for a total of 45 minutes before our drinks arrived. When we got there we sat down, there was only about 6 other tables occupied. 5 minutes later we had to ask the waiter who was standing beside me (less then 6 ft away) the whole time and never once bothered to acknowledge us for a drinks menu. Then after 10 minutes I had to approach him again to take our order because he couldnt be bothered approaching us again. Then 25 minutes later I asked where our drinks where and he disappeared to go look. Eventually another bar person came up to ask us what we originally ordered and then finally the drinks arrived. Then the most unusual thing occured, the same waiter stood over me until I signed the bar tab...I told him politely I would fill it in when I was ready to which he replied \"ok but I must stand here till you do\"! It was APPALLING service! The other major negatives about this hotel are the room decors which are so dated its not funny anymore, the lift waiting times and the cost of everything!

The rooms, well yes, they are not the most modern in Hong Kong for sure, and could use some work, but then again, everything works. Size of the rooms was ok, even in our room with the extra bed, we never felt too cramped. And the view was amazing, even with reclaiming work done at the front of the hotel. We ate once at the Dickens, food was nice, service good and the prices not too bad.

Everyone, down to the security and breakfast table waiters, seem personally pleased to looking after you (the only exception was one surly chamber maid, perhaps she was afraid of speaking English).

The rooms are in excellent shape, with super sound-proofed windows so you can't hear any of the din outside. We slept like a log on the king-sized bed with over-sized heavenly pillows, there's a sofa-seat in the window bay with probably one of the best city views in the world, plush and clean carpets (we don't often walk bare-footed in a hotel), large safe, flat TV. Spotless bathroom with powerful H&C bath/shower, decent toiletries. Only grumble: The TV seemed on the small side given this is a luxury hotel, a 42in+ would be better, and it oddly didn't swivel, especially given the comfy bay window sofa was a pleasant spot to sit and watch after a long day shopping, I had to drag/scrape the screen around. Also the TV channels kept pausing and blanking out with irritating regularity, it was like watching YouTube over a crappy broadband. Overall, if you want be in the middle of all the action HK has to offer, this is the best . Tourist tip: take the tunnel through the car-park to see the noon-day gun.

The room I had was a harbour view but on the corner so it was an odd shaped room. You can see by the hotel pictures it is a roundish hotel. The odd shaped room made the layout a bit odd but it is still useable. By Hong Kong standards it's a decent sized room. Upon check in the staff was very good. I think that is one thing that is Mandarin Oriental level. The time we were there it was quite rainy so it was good to see that the hotel had many umbrellas in good working condition for the guests. We were able to sample a few of the restaurants in the hotel due to the bad weather keeping us from straying too far away. Had a lunch buffet at the Dickens bar downstairs. Very good array of food and the place was packed at lunch. Had dinner at their Italian restaurant Cammino. It was a bit over priced but the food was good. Had the spaghetti bolognaise. It was excellent. Also had the breakfast buffet on their second floor that is open to the lobby and has views of the harbour. Good staff here again and a large array of food choices including a juice bar where you can choose the fruit you want mixed together and they juice it in front of you. It is not cheap but buffets at major hotels never are but this one was very good to go along with the cost. As noted above, the location is excellent. It is attached to the World Trade Center shopping mall which has some unique stores in it. Check out UNIQLO for inexpensive interesting clothing. It is also just down the passage away from Sogo and many other stores. That also means it is also very close to the Causeway Bay MTR station. It is truly just steps away from the hotel doors.

The only thing lacking was free internet access so we limited our time on line on our trip. If you don't bring an ipad or computer the only access on line is through the business centre at great expense.

The day cleaning was very efficient and usually done by the time we got back from breakfast. Breakfast was very impressive. There is a vast buffet with every cuisine catered for. You can be healthy or really go for it. The staff at breakfast need the correct day's ticket you will be issued with when you check in. All of the staff speak good English and a particularly helpful member of staff was Andisy (if I can remember to spell his name correctly) who got us extra large glasses of orange juice without prompting, saving us trips to and from the buffet.

This meal was much more expensive than those around and about in the area, but it was just easier to eat there. The food is European in style and was yummy. However we loved the street food and Dim sum restaurants where you can eat very cheaply. We both felt very comfortable and enjoyed our stay. We would stay at the Excelsior again and would recommend it as a good base for a trip to HK. A number of airlines use it as their hotel and I was informed by our flight attendant that the excelsior has been the base for BA for 25 years which is a credit to them.

We decided to go for an Executive room because of the added value and it really paid. We always remembered the Excelsior as a frenetic hotel full of Japanese tourists. Nothing much has changed except there are also a lot of mainland Chinese staying there. The Executive lounge on the 31st floor became our home-from-home during our stay. The staff in the lounge could not have been more helpful or charming. The lounge, where you also check in and check out, is open till 11pm and teas, coffee, soft drinks and beer are available all the time. But there is also a snack lunch service [say, soup, curry, cheese, fruit and assorted pastries], afternoon tea with scones and cream, more snacks and wine from 6-8pm. And it is all included in the room rate. This meant that we only had to buy one meal a day and hardly any drinks. During the week, we probably saved on food/drink costs twice the cost of the supplement for the room. We were also entitled to a 20% discount on all food and drink anywhere else in the hotel. How does Hong Kong in 2012 compare with 1980? Much cleaner in the street and harbour, no spitting, no more bargains eating out or shopping - everything seemed more expensive than the UK, very good public parks, still the same efficient public transport with the addition of the MTR and air conditioned buses, still very good and friendly service everywhere.

Many of the reviews mention the hotel's location in Causeway Bay - which is indeed a busy part of the island. The proximity to the many shopping delights HK is famous for, in addition to being just metres from the MRT, makes it great for visitors. The hotel is showing the wear and tear of its age though and could well do with a spruce up. My room was a harbour view king, good size with all the amenities. Wifi is pricey in comparison to many hotels of a similar standard. ToTT's on the top floor serves good bar meals as well as full dining and has a reasonable drink list and a happy hour scheme. Breakfast in the cafe on the 1st floor is okay, not outstanding given my many experiences of other hotels in Hong Kong. Dickens bar in the basement has Guinness on tap, and very helpful and pleasant staff. Checkin time involved a 20 minute wait in a queue, which had less to do with numbers of visitors attempting to check in at the same time and more with the time taken per visitor. Check out was fast and efficient. Be aware that as the hotel caters for large groups, the lifts can sometimes be overloaded and it can take some time to \"catch one\".

During my stay it was not helped by an enourmous Christmas Tree and a shed sized Gingerbread house, must admit they looked great. The staff however were very efficient and checking us all in and arranging to have luggage delivered to the room. Rooms: Very very VERY dated. Apart from the flat screen TVs and iPod docking station these rooms are in dire need of an update. The wood effect is very Ninties and the whole effect is very cluttered. The bed was comfortable enough however the pillows were very hard. I was also placed right beside the house keeping store room and was disturbed as early as 6am with chatter and noise from it. I could also here the person in the room next to me as I was given an adjoining room. I found the bathroom not to be the cleanest especially around the bath tub and toilet. The climate control in the room was not very effective. I could not get the temperature down to a cool level and the windows did not open. Alas I had no view this time around although I have been in rooms before with a lovely view of the harbour. Gym: Excellent gym with a spacious and well equipped layout. The staff were very friendly in offering to show me the facilities. However I though the charge to grab an apple from the basket on the reception counter was a bit much. (You soon learn that EVERYTHING is charged at this hotel). Bar: I went for a few drinks in the Dickens bar the first night I was there. I was APPALLED at the prices. I rarely expect to pay more then Dublin prices for a pint but my god they make Ireland look cheap in this place. On top of that the staff behind the bar are perhaps the rudest bar staff I have ever encountered. Not just this time but when I think about it, they have been rude everytime I have visited. On this occassion they just stood behind the counter busying themselves with cleaning glasses and not making eye contact with any customers until you literally had to shout at them to get any attention, and Im too polite to shout. When I asked what beers they had they simply shoved a menu in my face instead of just telling me, then disappeared off before giving me a chance to make a selection leaving me there for another 5 minutes before I could get their attention again. I have subsequently found a number of atmospheric bars in the area who do not over charge and actually have amazing views over the harbour so I shall be frequenting them instead. Lifts: The lift waiting times were terrible. I was on floor 12 and there is a bank of 4 lights which serve floors 1-19. One of these lifts was out of service for the length of my stay leaving 3 to barely cope. Rarely did I wait an acceptable time for a lift, I often found myself waiting up to 5 minutes and then when the lift does arrive it would be completely full and stop at almost every floor. I find this extremely frustrating. Location: This hotel is in perhaps the best part of Hong Kong. Shops immediately outside the door, right next to major shopping centers and markets, right besite the Causeway Bay MTR station, loads of restaurants nearby. Just a cab ride to all the night life spots...truly a brilliant location. Value: This is one EXPENSIVE hotel with everything costing extra. If you get a good deal then fine but if you get a similar deal at one of the better known hotels nearby I would say go to them. I have no choice, my company book me in here but if I had a choice I would probably go somewhere else. My last stay in Hong Kong was in the Kowloon Grand Bay and it was so amazing in comparison however its location did leave a lot to be desired. Overall it was a very average stay.

And what a big mistake that would have been. I have written four previous reviews for Trip Advisor, one of which was for the Holiday Inn Golden Mile in Kowloon, Hong Kong. As I wrote at the time, I couldn\u2019t really fault the hotel but also said that, only because of the continual harassment by touts for 24-hour tailors, fake watches, etc, I would probably go for a hotel on the Island side next time \u2013 and that\u2019s what I did. I could probably write a really long favourable review on the Excelsior but would, instead go with all the\u201dfavourable\u201d comments written by other reviewers regarding service, views, and everything else the reviewers raved about.

Furniture and decor need updating / the rooms smell musty (reviews of 6 November, 14 September & 30 August). It sounds to me as though they are describing a different hotel - not my experience at all. It\u2019s a good hotel (not the top of the line but still classy), service second to none, great value for money, has some outstanding facilities including the rooftop ToTT, there is a direct pedestrian (indoor) walkway to the adjacent World Trade Centre mall and NO TOUTS crossed my path on Hong Kong Island. The last morning before we checked out, we strolled along the harbour front opposite the hotel and took a water taxi around the inner and outer harbour. My partner, although she doesn't really like being on water, enjoyed it. Worth doing! Just one final thing about getting to and from the hotel and the airport. My partner and I eventually found that the easiest and least stressful way is by getting a return ticket on the airport link train to Hong Kong Central Station then get the free shuttle bus (H2) which drops you outside the hotel \u2013 vice versa too", "Date": "November 17, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Luxembourg", "Title": "\u201cConvenient location, good value.\u201d", "Author": "alcuin850", "ReviewID": "UR120683704", "Content": "Onlyk issue was I was not impressed with sound proofing between rooms.

Some of the hotels I have stayed in are international brand names 5-6 stars hotels to simple budget 3 star local hotels. However, with each trip, I try to make it a point of getting a room in Excelsior Hotel in Hong Kong. Why? 3 Reasons. Location, location, location.http://www.mandarinoriental.com/excelsior/ Firstly, it is not the most modern hotel you can find in Hong Kong. Excelsior Hotel is showing her age. The rooms are functional and rather out-dated by today's standard. The central air con hums a bit. The lobby, restaurants and facilities speak of an age gone by. Don't get me wrong. The amenities of this hotel are good. Just that it could use a major upgrading and retrofit. The hotel mainly see guests who are your tour groups, from China, Indonesia, etc. Air Crews and a small percentage of business travelers like me. So, what is great of this hotel. 1. Location: Overlooking Hong Kong Bay, get a room with the harbor view. The morning sunrise is nice to see and at night, with the lights turned on, the buildings across the bay seems to sparkle. Go up to ToTT's or Roof Terrace, on the top most floor of the hotel, and have a beer and enjoy this view as you unwind for the day. 2. Location: The hotel is right smack in the Causeway Bay area. Get out of the hotel, and you are at one of Hong Kong's busiest shopping area. Times Square is a good 25 mins slow stroll away and there a lots more shopping malls and stores as you take an evening walk to TImes Squares. If you are hungry, there are a lot of good eateries around this area, from your traditional Hong Kong 'tea rooms', Dim Sum restaurants, Japanese, Korean, Western food etc. 3. Location: Getting around is a breeze from this hotel. Hong Kong MTR station is only 15 mins away via a taxi, and 20 mins away to the financial district. Sometimes, during rush hour, it may take a while to get a taxi. Don't fert. Walk out of the hotel and in 10-15 mins, you are at Causeway Bay MTR station. Lastly, I always like the breakfast of fresh egg tarts and a good cup of coffee. Instead of your usual boring international breakfast buffet, I usually go to the ground floor to Expresso cafe for this hotel's famous Lord Stow's egg tarts and a strong cup of coffee. It only cost HK$80 for a nice freshly baked egg tart. So, if you are just in Hong Kong and your hotel is just for a place to sleep, then Excelisor wouldn't be a bad choice for you.", "Date": "September 20, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Location": "5", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "4", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Nottingham, England", "Title": "\u201cGood as a tourist base, not the best hotel I have stayed in in HK\u201d", "Author": "Samsiebabes", "ReviewID": "UR118232219", "Content": "We stayed here last summer whilst visiting my brother in law.

The Moment i got down from the transport the guy at the gate greeted me and also took care of my luggage by just handing over a baggage tag and asking me to give it at the front desk. It made me a bit worried but then thought such a big hotel there should be some co-ordination and also i saw others doing it. I went to the front desk checked myself in and they asked me for the baggage tag themselves. I reached my room on the 27th floor again a non-smoking one as i dont smoke, The view when i entered the room was amazing a huge room, very clean and the best part was the View from the window oh my it was amazing, it was facing the sea. The view made me stand at the window for he next 10 mins and observe the beauty of HongKong. In the mean time my luggage was delivered to my room which was amazing. The hotel traffic was comparatively cheap than other hotels and it included a free breakfast. When i say breakfast it was a whole range stuff that was being offered to you for breakfast and again the sitting area was awesome facing the sea. i could sit there the whole day and observe the beauty if i was asked too. Though it was a buffet breakfast there were people around to help you serve the same and they were so polite and helpful which i did not find in the last hotel i stayed. i was there for a week and everyday i used to go for my work and the moment i reach the door the guy at the door made a point to greet me. which is again not the case in many hotels in HK.

The sports bar in the basement of the hotel is a good place to chill out at the end of the day. It's informal and relaxed if you are want a beer after running around the city. The bar on the top floor 'TOTT' is very swish. We had a couple of drinks there on our last night and they sat us by the window overlooking the harbour (great view again!). The band playing were very talented. We ate at the chinese restaurant at the hotel. The staff were very pleasant and the food was good. The only thing I would comment on about this is that the table layout and the order of food are different from that in the UK. This was a formal meal and so there were extra bowls and spoons placed on the table which we were not sure what to do with! The prolem with this is that we spent much of our time looking at other tables to try and copy whatever they were doing, but it wasn't easy as they didn't seem to have the same stuff.

Having stayed in a large, well appointed Shangri La room in Dalian for the previous week, I was expecting soemthing similar from the Mandarin Oriental chain in Hong Kong when staing at the Excelsior. I was to be sorely disappointed. Upon arrival we were met at the front of the hotel and arrangements were made to transfer our luggage to our rooms. So far so good. We joined a long line for check in and after a lengthy wait I was called forward. I was booked into a deluxe double room and once we had gone through the usual formalities I was taken aback with the throwaway line \"by the way, it's not a double bed in this room it's two singles pushed together\". That's the sort of comment I might expect to hear in a Travel Lodge or Premier Travel Inn but not at a hotel that is part of the Mandarin Oriental chain. \"Is this ok?\" the staff member enquired. \"No, it's not ok\" was the fairly obvious response. I asked to be changed to a room with a proper double bed and was told this wouldn't be possible. I pressed more firmly and was told I could have a room with a double bed if I was prepared to wait for three and a half hours until 10:30pm. I told them this too was unacceptable. The check in staff refused to look at any other options and finally I was told that I would need to take the assigned room and change at a later date if I wanted a different room. After unpacking everything this was going to be a hassle so I took the original room and the unpleasant experience with me. The room itself was small, dated and a real disappointment for a hotel chain with such a good reputation. I was glad I wasn't having to pay for this. The bathroom was clean but had a grubby feel to it. The view out of the bedroom window wasn't bad. To add to the mounting disappointments, there was no free wifi in the room and fixed broadband was also chargeable. Not great for a business hotel. Breakfast wasn't included in the room rate so I didn't eat any meals in the hotel, instead opting for cheaper local options nearer the office. On the plus side the location of the hotel is very good and is probably its best point. Would I stay here again? Only under protest. This was my first stay at a Mandarin Oriental Hotel and as they say, you only get one chance to make a first impression. The Excelsior failed on that count.", "Date": "December 14, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "london", "Title": "\u201cGreat service\u201d", "Author": "slsLondon", "ReviewID": "UR89531885", "Content": "I've stayed at the Excelsior 3 times.

The irony is I was on the Executive Floor, and I would have expected a more premium room assigned for it. This is my 2nd stay in Excelsior after 4 years. During this period, I stayed in Shangrila, Marriott, Sheraton and Langham, all beats Excelsior hands-down. (The only compliment I have is for the staff in the Executive Lounge, read below) The room was the smallest among the 4/5 stars hotels I had stayed in HKG, though many people presumed that the rooms in HKG are small, but that's not entirely true. The nightmare is the TV ... it's the oldest and smallest TV I had experienced. It was a box TV and slightly larger than a 14inch. To make it worse, it was tucked away to the extreme right side of the room, while the bed was in the centre. I'm generally not a TV person, hence I decided not to create a fuss by demanding a change of room. Later that night, I tried to on the TV, and true enough, the remote control doesn't work from a far, I have to sit at the edge of my bed, stretch my hand to control it. Gave up immediately. The amenties are from Crabtree & Evelyn (I believe only for the Executive Level). The bathroom is clean. Compliments for the staff in the Executive Lounge, very professional, prompt and pleasant. The lounge was actually a better place to hang around than in the tired-looking room (it reminds me of the 80s). The food in the lounge was slightly disappointing too, had almost the rest spread for 5 days, especially the cut-fruits. I doubt I would return to Excelsior (unless the rest of the hotels are full) as HKG is a small island after all.

The hotel is located less than a five minutes walk from the MRT station if you exit from the Causeway Bay Sogo Department Store exit. Cross the traffic junction and in about 100m you'll find yourself at the World Trade Centre (WTC). From there, if you cut through the WTC by going up the escalators, there will be a sky bridge that links WTC to the second floor of the hotel. This reduces the amount of time exposed to the unbearably humid conditions during the summer. The Portugese Egg Tarts from the hotel's cafe (ground floor) are quite delicious and my personal favourite HK styled cafe, Tsui Wah is just a hop, skip and a jump away (in fact there are two). Tsui Wah's Pork Chop Buns and the \"Piglet Buns\" (direct translation) are highly recommended. Speaking of good food, the hotel's breakfast buffet for HKD178 per pax provided a wonderful selection of breakfast goodies enough to satisfy the tummy till mid afternoon. Note to hotel: The Excelsior should carry out renovations to all their rooms as soon as possible to revamp the slightly dated room interiors. Choose lighter wood interiors over dark cherry wood to help enhance the feeling of spaciousness inside the rooms.

Their food outlets seem pretty good too - there's a nice rooftop bar/restaurant with a great view over town, and the Dickens bar in the basement is friendly and atmospheric, and gets quite active when a game's on (I watched a World Cup Football match there). Close to the Causeway Bay subway station, and taxis are pretty reasonably priced anyway. Cab to Airport Express Central station costs about 35 HKD. Internet is expensive at 35 HKD/hour.

My mum was on a business trip and so we were allocated rooms on the executive floors. The rooms are spacey with a range of drawers and space to put clothes.

We were given free internet connection due to the purpose of our stay, but it was easily accessible and the prices were reasonable. Breakfast in the executive lounge was delicious, with a definite variety of food about! Also, as part of the executive lounge, we received lunch, afternoon tea, and snacks for free whenever! The staff in the lounge were wonderful, very polite and quick to learn names which made you feel special. I do recommend the upgrade, it may be slighty more expensive, but you do get what you pay for. Otherwise, there is a range of quick snack cafes to traditional restaurants around. The restaurants we visited were TOTT's which offers an exceptional view over the harbour and the traditional Cantonese restaurant. These were both of very high standard. There is also a bar/pub which is VERY BRITISH downstairs. Throughout the day it is filled with obviously British men and women, with football or rugby playing on the TV's and recognisable music playing over the sound system. This is a lovely 'homely' getaway from the hustle and bustle of Hong Kong. Other nights we ventured out to the centre of hong kong which is a very quick metro ride away. Most of the population chose to ride via metro, but it is not busy. It is very well sign posted, with LED lights noting which stop you are at and even which side of the carriage to exit! The prices are also AMAZING! I would recommend buying an 'oyster' card or as they call it 'octopus' card. They may not make it quite clear about the conditions, but we later found out after opting not to buy these, that they were a much better deal. You can travel the metro, the bus, the ferry and the tram with these cards, and if you do not use your credit by the end of your stay, you simply return to an information desk and they give you the money back which you have no spent! The hotel views look out upon the harbour which at night is a sight to see. In the day time, the heavy smog that hangs over Hong Kong does prevent you from seeing too far out. I definitely recommend the markets in Hong Kong, even if you do not buy anything, they are worth a wonder round. Especially the night market over on Kowloon. You can definitely find knock of brands for fractions of the prices, especially a lot of Polo Ralph Lauren! The hotel are also very helpful with troubleshooting. We left a laptop on the plane and realized when we got to the hotel. Luckily our airline crew were actually checking in at the exact same time as us, and they managed to give us the flight phone number. The hotel then took things into their own hands and did everything for us. We arrived at about 4pm local Hong Kong time, and by 9pm that evening the laptop was with us. The concierge and desk staff are very helpful. They can help with absolutely anything, and are very kind. I would gladly return to the excelsior hotel.

Island' for many years and is unequalled in location - both from being right on the very edge of the spectacular harbour (especially the night-time view) & in terms of the abundance of shops, restaurants, public transport and other attractions literally right outside your doorstep. Causeway Bay itself is a better bet than a Kowloon-side hotel in the writer's opinion and the whole ambience is fast, busy, exciting and above all safe. The hotel's restaurants are all first-class and not over-the-top expensive - dinner-buffet on 'Cafe on the First' is a real treat and extremely good value with an amazing array of varied & delicious choice, likewise the 'Yee Tung Heen' cantonese and 'Cammino' Italian restaurants. The basement 'Dickens' Bar' has a good atmosphere by night and does a geat lunch-time curry buffet for a tenner with a free drink !

This was a surprise holiday for her to a place she had always dreamed of going. So here we go... Check in, Is it me or does it seem to take an age to check in (anywhere) nowadays, however, we had just got off an overnight fight from London and were knackered, but it was worth the wait as they upgraded us to a full harbour view room. The Room What is it with these people who are consistently moaning about the size of rooms in the far east - where have they stayed before? I'd love to know. Do you go on holiday to recharge your moaning batteries. They're probably either Americans or business types who don't get out much. I didn't go to HK to stay in a hotel room all day. It was clean and well appointed with a 2 seater built in couch (beneath the full harbour view window!!), a single built in seat, a good sized wardrobe, mini bar & coffee making area, a large desk area that ran half the length of the room which my wife turned into her own makeup department with associated toiletries, (I had a small section for my one bottle of aftershave in the bathroom!) And if you were able to swing an asiatic lion around, you wouldn't touch the sides!! Oh and then there's the king size bed! Its plenty big enough. On the value side of things, the mini bar was very expensive (aren't they all) and so never touched. The Bathroom Always very clean. Power shower over the bath, always got hot water, shower curtain was spotless (even though you could tell it wasn't brand new). One point here is that a taller person may have trouble standing upright in the shower as the ceiling appeared low. Housekeeping Fantastic. The girls were extremely friendly and kept our room immaculate. I think our carpet was hoovered every day (that's for all you lot who like discussing dirty carpets on this site!). We always walked back into our room at night and it was as if we were entering the room for the first time. Hotel amenities Never tried Dickens Bar or any of the restaurants so can't really comment. There's a few shops in the hotel but we were so keen to visit the sights of HK, again we never visited. There is a small bakery shop on the ground floor (this WAS visited on several occassions, plus a few more that the wife was unaware of) that sells various danish pastries and cakes/sweets and the most delicious egg tarts. Reception Typical of your now common big hotel concierge. There were about 3 to 4 concierge staff on at the same time and this is where I marked them down on the service score slightly. Whilst they seemed very keen to service your request for information, they never really answered the question I asked - its as if they assumed they knew what you were going to ask, and then decided on the answer they would give while you finished asking the question and then answered with info' you didn't really want or understand, however I asume an allowance has to made for my northern UK dialect. \"MIke\" however, was fantastic and always answered with info' I was looking for (but he wasn't always on the desk), he even knew ALL the bus numbers to get around the city. Oh by the way, don't go everywhere by MTR, take the bus and really take in the city, or a tram, especially at night. Location I believe excellent, some may not, for the reason I do. It's on the less manic side of HK (HK island, not Kowloon). Its next to the impressive Victoria Park, far enough away from the central district to avoid the crowds yet close enough to get to quickly. Times Sq and all the bright lights of Hennessy Rd are all close by and the MTR is just round the corner. Hong Kong itself Amazing, we went for 7 days, no way near long enough, going again next year probably for 10 days to see all the stuff we missed.

Room is very clean with nice touch such as all our books were given a bookmark by the maid! But the best part of the hotel is its great location. Easy to get around and shuttle service provided to the convention center. Breakfast buffet is the best I had in HK and I had stayed in at least 6 other hotels in HK. Food is very fresh and tasty, very delicately prepared, not like other buffet breakfast but more like what you will find in a fine restaurant. Juices are fresh including custom juice bar where you can pick the fruits & vegetables you want for your juice. Service in the restaurant is very quick with beautiful view out to the harbor. The executive lounge is another great point about this hotel. Although small, it is very comfortable and great service. Wine and champagne glass are filled immediately and the canape is just to die for during happy hour 6-8pm. I don't even bother with dinner and just enjoy myself at the lounge at night. The best part, of course, is the dessert which is of the quality you only find at the best restaurant, easily costing $8 each and they have a different selection every night. With the breakfast buffet, light lunch, and happy hour, the lounge fee more than pay for itself, I highly recommend it. Compared to other HK hotels I stayed, Excelsior has the best service. It is very good value if you choose the club floor rooms. Seasoned travelers who seek a little bit of luxury and comfort will find Excelsior a great choice.

Last time we stayed at the Shangri-la in Kowloon (which was fantastic) so this time we decided to try to view of the harbour from the island. Plus we have kids now so couldn't afford to stay at the Shangri-la again. We had booked interconnecting side harbour view rooms with a guaranteed upgrade to full harbour view. However when we arrived the interconnecting full harbour view rooms were all taken. After some hard negotiating at reception we upgraded to a suite with two bedrooms on the corner of the 21st floor. The cost of the upgrade was very reasonable when you take into account that it included access to the executive lounge on the 31st floor with free buffet breakfast, all day snacks, drinks and cocktails included. Also the view from the lounge and the kids bedroom was amazing. We sat looking out of the window watching the boats going by for hours. It is also a good spot to watch the lazer show at 8pm each night. Our suite had a large double bedroom with a walk-in wardrobe and ensuite bathroom. The lounge was even bigger and there was a seperate bathroom in the hallway. The kids room had twin beds and an ensuite bathroom. The decor may be a little dated but the carpet was luxurious and there was a big flat screen TV in each room and a games console in the lounge. If you are staying in Hong Kong with your family then I would recommend a suite at the excelsior - after all with that view and all that space you can't go wrong. Breakfast was excellent. The staff could not do enough for us. We had a wonderful 5 nights at this hotel. We didn't eat in the hotel other than breakfast because there are so many other great places to eat nearby - try crossing the air conditioned bridge link from the hotel to the World Trade Centre for starters. To get about in Hong Kong you couldn't be better placed. The MTR station at Causeway Bay is less than 5 minutes away and the trams are just a bit further. If you have young children and can stretch to a suite then this is a perfect way to experience Hong Kong.

The reason being I wished to watch a particular play in Hong Kong on Xmas day and the by the time I've confirmed my trip it was too late for the tickets to be mailed to my house as it takes 10-15 days for overseas patron. Hence I emailed Excelsior requesting the tickets to be sent to the conceirge and be collected upon my arrival. My request was very promptly attended to and followed up by sending me acknowledgement that the mail has been received. One may think that it is expected of the hotel to provide such personal service; nonetheless I'm still very impressed by their speed and sincerity to serve their guests. Apart from excellent service, this hotel by Mandarin Oriental Group offers great location. Ladies, get ready to shop til you drop as SOGO and Patterson Street is just a 5 mins walk away. World Trade Centre (Shopping again!) is just beside the hotel with Starbucks facing the side entrance of the hotel. But I suggest to stroll down to Jaffe Road for a taste of milk tea in Hong Kong Cafes. There is a 7-11 store very close to the hotel in case you need something *ahem* urgent in the wee hours.. (to fill your hungry stomachs I mean). The nearest MTR exit is also of a very short walking distance. Airport express bus stop for bus A11 (costing only HKD40 per trip to/from airport) is also easily accessible. The hotel is also the only franchise in Hong Kong that sells possibly the best portugese/macanese egg tartlet from Lord Stow's Bakery minus the queue common at Coloane, Macao. Finally I'm coming to the rooms. I've booked a double room with side harbour view; but its not worth the extra price for the side harbour view. Perhaps one should just go for the full harbour view or just the city view. The room is very spacious and human intelligient (at least this is what I feel in comparison to the Venetian @Macao). The bed is not hard where hard beds is a common phenomenon in the SARs and China as other members have reviewed.

The public areas of this hotel are very well-maintained. My complaint is that there was a very unpleasant, moldy odor in the bathroom of my room, which seeped into the rest of the room, even with the bathroom door closed. Because the room and bathroom *looked* very clean and orderly, I assumed the smell had to do with some problem with the building's structure/plumbing (rather than a problem with that specific room), and I tried to ignore the smell for several days. However, after staying in the room for several days, I finally realized that the foul smell was coming from the shower curtain; I requested that it be changed and the problem was instantly solved. I really have a hard time reconciling how well kept the hotel was in general with how little attention the housekeeping staff seemed to pay to something as simple as asking \"what is that smell?\" and \"what can I do to fix it?\" without the hotel guest having to request that the shower curtain be changed. I am also disconcerted by the fact that the shower curtain had that smell when I first checked into the room, suggesting that the towel either had not been changed from an earlier guest, or had not been adequately cleaned between guests. Apart from that not-inconsequential issue, I was generally very impressed by the Excelsior. The location is very convenient in Causeway Bay, less than a 5-minute stroll to the nearest metro subway entrance (and you can take the train, with a transfer, all the way to the airport for much less than the cost of a taxi or private bus ride). The hotel's fitness room was one of the best-equipped of any hotel I have recently visited (unfortunately, the fitness room closed a little earlier than what would have been ideal). The housekeeping staff paid attention to such little details as leaving a separate bookmark to be placed in each of the books that I had left out on the desk! Fresh fruit and bottled water were replenished each afternoon. Rather than telephoning to ask whether turndown service was required, the staff respected the \"do not disturb sign\" and silently slipped a note under the door indicating that they had stopped by instead. All the staff with whom I interacted from check in through checkout were extremely efficient and gracious. The website description of the room is misleading in that it advertises \"these rooms are located on the 14th to the 27th and 33th floors, with partial views of the harbour and offer facilities including internet broadband and multi channel TV,\" yet the internet access required a separate fee (the multi channel TV did not), and this fee was not disclosed on the website. I have no objection to paying a separate fee for internet access, so long as the the hotel makes that fee very clear when the room is being booked. As for partial harbour view rooms, there was so much fog most days during my stay, and the view of the harbour was so narrow, that the additional premium for a side view of the harbour was probably not worth the cost.", "Date": "January 1, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Musselburgh, East Lothian", "Title": "\u201cExcellent Excelsior\u201d", "Author": "denise_carlyle2", "ReviewID": "UR23093088", "Content": "We stayed in the Excelsior for three nights as part of a tour we were doing of Bangkok, Hong Kong, Bali and Singapore.

It\u2019s not spectacular\u2026actually, it\u2019s far from it, but if you are looking for a hotel in the center of a bustling location, then Excelsior would pretty much fit that profile. The Arrival. Upon check in, we were told that the Club Level Non-Smoking Twin One Bedroom Suite did not exist, even though we were able to book it. The one bedroom suites only came with a king bed and only existed on a smoking level floor. Anyway, to make a long story short, we chose to go with the Club Level 1 Bedroom Suite on the Smoking level. They offered to push the two twin beds (that made up the King bed) as far apart as possible\u2026which was about a foot. Oddly enough, I read on someone else\u2019s review that they found themselves in the same predicament. Anyway, since we opted for the Club Level One Bedroom Suite, a full buffet breakfast, light lunch, and afternoon tea and cocktails were included. There was also complimentary bottle of wine, a large box of chocolates, fresh fruit, and Chinese tea upon our arrival. The Room. Tired and haggard would be a good term for the room. There were open electrical lines, ajar windows that couldn\u2019t close, peeling wallpaper, a not so cleanly toilet and very battered furniture. From afar, it was a very basic room, but when you actually start to sit and actually use the facilities, you\u2019ll find that it is high time The Excelsior goes through a major renovation. Please see pictures and decide for yourself. Let\u2019s just say it wasn\u2019t worth what we paid. Oh yeah. I almost forgot. The in-room safe was unbolted to the floor. Technically, I could pick it up and walk away with it. The Service. Everyone was extremely friendly and helpful. A trait that I was a bit surprised at since service and helpfulness are often not part of the \u201cvocabulary\u201d in Hong Kong. Most people could care less about what you wanted and care even less about trying to helping you out. The Dining. We only ate our complimentary breakfast buffet at the hotel and that was\u2026uh\u2026how should I put this nicely\u2026not so great. But breakfast was breakfast and if you just stuck to the basics: an egg, a piece of toast, and orange juice, then everything was OK. Let\u2019s just say it was wonderful to have a Starbucks across the street. The Departure. Check out was pretty normal. Everyone was courteous and professional. Hindsight, I think I could have done without all the complimentary gifts and amenities and preferred the same room at a more reasonable rate. The room rate was about HK$5000/night (approximately US$625/night). Honestly, I wouldn\u2019t stay there again since Park Lane is right next door.

The size of our deluxe harbor view room was fine (and larger than many European hotels) and a very nice view. The bathroom and tub/shower were on the smaller side but not tiny. Service at the desk, front door, restaurant (floor 1, breakfast) and lobby area was very good. The concierge desk was helpful and good, and always had multiple people working. Our longest wait for concierge assistance was a minute or so. Taxicabs were always available, and the wait, if any, was never longer than a couple of minutes. The hotel is located across a main and busy street from the bay and Noon Day Gun, a minute or so walk from Victoria Park, and near the entrance to the tunnel to Kowloon (thus relatively easy for cabs to and from the airport and Kowloon). The restaurant/buffet on floor 1 is nice. The breakfast buffet is terrific and large, with views of the bay. it was about U.S. $25, including the 10% service charge, . The coffee/muffin/fruit caf\u00e9 by the elevators is handy. Starbucks is steps away out the side door, on the ground floor of the adjacent World Trade Center. Dickens pub, downstairs, is nice. The hotel is adjacent to a bustling and bright (and large) shopping and restaurant area. This busy area is steps away out the side door and towards the back of the hotel. The World Trade Center is next to the hotel and literally steps away. The World Trade Center has floors of nice shops and good restaurants. We ate at good Vietnamese (Rice Paper about floor 4) and Korean BBQ (maybe floor 12) restaurants. The MTR/Causeway Bay is a few minutes away, on Hennessy near the Sojo department store. Times Square, the very nice multi-story shopping mall, is a 5-10 minute walk away. It has very good restaurants in the top floors. We purchased inexpensive cell phones (368HK) and local SIM cards at one of the many telephone stores on Yee Wo street (a couple blocks from the hotel). Very handy for keeping in touch with our group and friends. Useable on other foreign trips, with the purchase of a local SIM card. We were in Hong Kong for a week for the rugby 7\u2019s. We would stay at this hotel again, primarily because of the location and friendly and good service. Our two prior stays were at the more expensive Shangri-La (which is a great hotel, but in our view, not as good of a location). If you want a fancy hotel, don't stay here.

I've known about this hotel for a long time but have never stayed there on any of my prior trips in the past 10 years. I'm glad I finally found my way here. The hotel is quite elegant and the harbourview room I booked definitely met my expectation in terms of decor, size, and view. When I first booked the room, I was sort of afraid that the hotel room would be quite small. It turned out to be pretty large by Hong Kong's standard. The room I stayed in was 2808. I had a King size bed that was very comfortable. The room had a very good view of Victoria Harbour and Tsim Tsa Tsui, Kowloon. The bathroom could be a little bit larger and grander, but it was suitable. One suggestion is that they change the lighting to be more warm and match the lighting in the room. If I remember correctly, florescent lighting was used and I always feel that florescent lighting is a bit dull and lackluster. I love the seats they have by the window. Allows for one to relax and enjoy the view or lounge a little bit. A negative I would point out is the TV. It's very small. They need to upgrade the TV to at least a 32\" flat panel like the other two hotels I stayed at during this trip. It looks so out of sort to have a small TV in such a large and elegant room. Also, they need to improve their menu system. For some reason they did not have the option for you to review your invoice on the TV. The only two menu options were movies and changing the language. The internet service cost $130HKD (or around there) per 24 hour usage. It's not the best rate, but reasonable. The most I ever paid for 24-hour use of internet service was at the Hilton Park Hotel in Munich, Germany where it cost close to $40 USD. That was outrageous. Anyways, getting back to the Excelsior, the gym was a decent size and also had a lot of new machines. The location of the hotel is good and bad. It's good because it's about 2 blocks from the Causeway Bay MTR entrance (exit D, I believe), which is right below the Sogo department store. There are a lot of shops and restaurants about a block or two away. The 7-11 was a block away. Convenience-wise, the location of the hotel was excellent. Now, of course, being that it's located in Causeway Bay, the area is just too crowded. When you go back to the hotel between late morning and the evening, you must maneuver through a sea of people. I also noticed that there's a lot of smokers in Hong Kong during this trip, and they must have identified the area around the hotel as the camping grounds for smoking. It was just not a good experience for those of us who want some fresher air, even in an already smoggy Causeway Bay area. Finally, to get into the hotel, you are usually walking through the back of the building. With the amount of tourists that use this passageway, I would recommend the hotel make the area a bit more colorful and appealing. Add some murals or something to make the walk more pleasing. Despite my recommendations and negative comments, I would still definitely stay at the Excelsior next time I go there.", "Date": "December 27, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "2", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Essex, UK", "Title": "\u201cAverage Hotel\u201d", "Author": "Stephanie01", "ReviewID": "UR11240228", "Content": "My husband and I stayed at the Excelsior for 3 nights after a 3 week trip to Australia.

It is easy to buy tickets, recharge an Octopus Card and find your way around the stations. All are very clearly sign posted in English. It is also very cheap and saves your feet if, like us, you plan to do a lot of sightseeing. We tried the Chinese, Italian, ToTT's and Dickens Bar for food. Dickens bar wasn't to my taste, but hubby wanted to watch cricket. ToTT's is great. Ask for a table near the window as you can look out over the harbour. It's a real treat. The Chinese was lovely as was the Italian. Also try the Macau custard tarts from the coffee shop. One of the hotel doors leads into a small shopping centre. The local area is enchanting at night.

What set it apart was the courteous staff, the excellent amenities and most of all, the convenient location of the hotel. The Excelsior is located on Hong Kong Island in an area called Causeway Bay, it is the epicenter of shopping, great dining and nightlife. It is also very conveniently located near an MTR station, Kong Kong's subway system. What truly makes the hotel excellent is the way the staff will go out of their way to make you comfortable. A great example is our check in process. We arrived on an early morning flight -- about 5:30am. By the time we got through customs and immigration and arrived at the hotel, it was not later than 7am. Check in is not until 3pm. We prepared ourselves to check our luggage at the bell desk and wait until we had rooms so we could get some rest after our long overseas flight. When we arrived at the lobby desk we gave our check in information to the friendly English-speaking employee and were checked in immediately -- no questions asked. We were handed hotel room keys and within no time at all were resting quite comfortably in our room before 7:30am! All staff that we encountered spoke English to some degree. This greatly helped us ease into our transition while staying in a foreign country. The breakfast buffet they offer is a little pricey, but worth it! For those of us missing a western-style breakfast, their offerings were exactly what we needed to help us get over our chinese-cuisine overload! It had eggs, bacon, sausage, waffles, fresh fruit and french press coffee, all the comforts of home and it also had items from a traditional Chinese and Japanese breakfast. Top that all off with a fresh squeeze juice bar and you've got a world class treat! The Excelsior Hotel has a walkway into the shopping mall next door called The World Trade Centre where you can find small boutiques and great restaurants and even a video game arcade to entertain the kids or in our case, the kid in us all. If I have one complaint about the Excelsior, it would be the size of the rooms. We had a double room for two people and it had two twin sized beds crammed into a small space with a small seating area. The bathroom is a normal size with only one sink. The deluxe rooms may have been bigger, but you can see from the pictures that there is no wasted space in this room! Our view of the Victoria Harbor was worth the size of the room, however! To sum up, I would highly recommend the Excelsior Hotel to anyone vacationing to Hong Kong, especially if it is your first time in Hong Kong.", "Date": "August 24, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "2", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "UESyorkie", "Title": "\u201cYou get what you pay for... a good value in HK, not much else\u201d", "Author": "UESyorkie", "ReviewID": "UR8280228", "Content": "The Excelsior is a good value hotel; you can get to \"downtown\" HK island and Kowloon easily by bus or subway, as well as hop on a bus to go to the beaches, etc. on the other side of the island.

We decided to stay at here on the strength of previous tripadvisor reviews. On the whole I would agree with those reviews. The hotel is situated in a great spot smack in the middle of the Causeway Bay shopping area, where the MTR (underground) entrance is no more than 200 meters away. The hotel staff was excellent, very polite and attentive. Upon checking in we were offered a room upgrade (I think this is a standard sales speech) so we decided to pay the little bit extra and have a 'partial harbour view' room. We were not disappointed. This was my first stay in HK, and the views from our 23rd floor room made the 12 hour flight worthwhile. The room itself was quite large, very clean and very comfortable, however, the photographs used by tripadvisor / expedia, aren\u2019t old 80\u2019s photos which haven\u2019t been updated, the d\u00e9cor really is stuck in a time warp! The Hotel has two good bars. The basement level is where you\u2019ll find Dickens Bar, an expat haven of a sports bar, which is well worth a look. The second bar is situated on the 34th floor, a bar / restaurant called Talk of the Town or TOTT. The views from the lounge bar are simply stunning (if you\u2019re on a budget the best time to go up there is between 5 and 8 which is happy hour / buy one get one free). We didn\u2019t eat at the hotel because we wanted to get out and explore HK, that being said the restaurant menus looked good and there were lots of local people eating there. In addition to the restaurants there is an excellent coffee shop situated to one side of the lobby, we found this a great place to grab a muffin and a hot drink for breakfast. All in all we had a great stay at the Excelsior and I would certainly go back / recommend it to my friends and family.

In my opinion the hotel is predominately a business hotel (being used by a significant amount of airline crew and people passing through for work) with the majority of tourists opting to stay in the slightly better class and better located hotels in central and admirality. Not to say that this hotel isnt used by tourists but they tended to be coach parties stopping by for one or two nights. The location of the hotel (in Causeway Bay) isn't bad but if your a tourist spending a few nights in Hong Kong then the hotels in Central will be the ones that you will give you the lifetime memories not the the Excelsior. Some observations from my time there: - the hotel is ok but it needs updating. The rooms are small and decorated in 1980s style - staff are friendly and attentive and nothing was too much trouble (bare in mind I was there for 2 weeks so I suspect I was considered a VIP by the end of my stay) - eat in the restaurants once or twice, but in my opinion it was better and cheaper to eat out (there are hundreds of decent restaurants nearby in Causeway Bay - go to Times Square or even across the way to the World Trade Center - fitness facilities are poor (no swimming pool) but if you are into running then go to nearby Victoria Park as that is lovely - it always seemed to be hectic at reception. even though there seemed to be loads of staff there were still queues - the business centre is very expensive to use (i.e. internet). go round the corner to the local internet cafe and get access at a 1/10th of the price. all in all an ok hotel, nothing special. if i had a choice i would suggest paying a little bit more and staying in a hotel in central. you will go home much happier with better memories.", "Date": "March 12, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Canada", "Title": "\u201cGreat Location and Nice Stay\u201d", "Author": "glowbal", "ReviewID": "UR6922743", "Content": "The Excelsior Hotel is located at the busy shopping area of Causeway Bay. About a short city block away from the MTR Causeway Bay Station near the Sogo department Store. The hotel is at the action of both retail shopping and close to large shopping malls and stores. On the north side of the hotel there is front way a very busy highway and a small feeder road for access to the hotel with limited access. The west side of the hotel is really the main entrance which is a small unappealing one way alley coming from the World Trade Centre shopping mall. The hotel is frequented by airline crew. The lobby is clean, decent, and well kept. Overall it is quite acceptable for a four star hotel. The service was good and English was well understood. After check-in there is a hotel staff person escorting you to the room. The hotel is divided about half for non-smoking floors and the other half smoking. The smell of smoke in the lobby was minor and not overwhelming. The smoke smell in the non-smoking was not present or minimal. The room itself was very small, decent, and well kept. The rooms are adequate and nice and do not need much updating. Maid service was prompt and efficient. The bathroom could have used some remodeling and was considered a poor factor in the service of the hotel. Everything worked in the bathroom but it needed updating. The other problem related to the bathroom was the water knock. When people used their shower the pipes started knocking which can be heard from a considerable distance, for this issue the rating is downgraded a notch within the star grade.

It is clearly an airline crew hotel though - they have a separate reception area (which had more staff than the regular one), and I spoke to a few different crew in the elevators during my time there, and they were all automatically in non-smoking rooms with an upgrade apparently. So regular tourists beware - re-confirm your booking and be prepared for a fight. I should note my friend who was staying there was put in a smoking room despite the non-smoking request at booking, and a non-smoking room was only made available two days into the three day stay (I am guessing once the aircrew checked out), despite him also receiving a promise of \"9pm that night\".

That they are owned by the Mandarin Oriental chain only makes it worse, since the staff thinks they are working at the Mandarin, but without the training and resources to bump up the service and amenities to make a stay here memorable or enjoyable. Certainly, if someone was not used to staying at first-rate hotels, they wouldn't notice how young and unprofessional the desk, lobby and business center staff are here. It's hard to describe it, since the differences can be subtle to those not used to good service, but to see what I mean simply walk into the lobby of the Peninsula in Hong Kong, and walk into the lobby here. Not taking into account the physical differences, which are not worth comparing (the Penisula is a more expensive hotel) but it doesn't cost anymore for a well-trained, professional and friendly staff. The Excelsior stumbles badly. The rooms are way over-designed. They look like a designer's first job, with an attempt to include everything they'd ever read about for a \"hip\" hotel (which this is not). A glass window from the shower to the room (senseless in this setting), glass sink bowl (always messy looking), backlighting, cove lighting, hidden lighting everywhere -- there are seven different light switches just for the room. It's silly -- and all the built-in furniture, shelves, tables, sofas, closets -- everything is over-wrought and jammed into the space making a typically small Asian room even smaller. I never did figure out how to turn the backlighting off inside the frosted glass closet. The room redo's are likely new, since they are in pretty good shape, but it looks dated -- mid-1990s stuff. The business center looks like it was passed by when the rooms were upgraded --definitely 1980s looking -- and get this, a 20 percent surcharge for calling DHL to pick up my box of laundry I was sending home. Every hotel I stayed in on this trip called DHL for free. That surcharge was absurd. And when I complained about it (a US$120 \"extra\" charge for making a phone call!!) to the manager on duty, he said \"it's the hotel policy\". Yes, but it's still stupid, policy or not. And a real hotel, offering real service NEVER tells a guest with a legitimate complaint, \"it's the hotel policy\" shrugs and walks away. As an overall experience was the stay bad? No, but what irks me is when a hotel pretends to be classy and service oriented, and it is not even close. Just be honest, Excelsior, you are a pedestrian hotel.

I have stayed at a large number of other hotels on Hong Kong (little experience on the Kowloon side) and while there are other hotels which are truely wonderful in Hong Kong (the Island Shangri-la I love) when you factor in price and location (Causeway Bay has all the shopping and restaurants on your doorstep) I keep returning in the Excelsior. You may not have the over the top lobby, but if you want Great Service at an acceptable price, stay here. {an acceptable alternative at a similar price/location - see The Park Lane.
