I really liked it, and would recommend it to any serious budget traveler. I paid 65 euros, which included all taxes, for an exterior room with a large window, that I believe was double-glazed to block out street noise. At least I wasn't bothered by street noise. In late July, early August, all I really wanted was air conditioning and a private bath. And cleanliness. I got all of these. I also liked the location. Quiet, facing a beautiful park, but no more than a 15-minute walk to the more heavier-trafficked tourist areas. It's metro stop is Arc de Tirumphe, on the convenient No. 1 metro line. It's near Estacio Nord, which is great if you're taking buses to other areas in northern Catalonia, and France. And a stone's throw from the Chocolate Museum, El Born. La Ribera, the Caterina market, and walking distance to Barceloneta. Location t was one of the reasons I chose it. Yes, there was some noise at night. You will hear banging doors, but it doesn't last long, and at these pirces, you need to adjust your expectations. I recommendi this hotel as a great value for budget-conscious travelers, who might enjoy a more local, but still convenient, neighborhood. The hotel is really about 30 rooms above a very good, established traditional-style restaurant. You'll have to drag your bags up a flight of stairs, but both times I had to do this, help was graciously offered. I thought the restaurant was excellent. Tradtional, hearty , good food--huge portions at reasonable prices. Not chic and hip, but very good. The real thing. At least it seemed that way to me. I want to single out one staff member, whose name I believe was Yolanda--she's multilingual--English, French, of course Spanish, and likely Catalan, and goodness knows what other languages. So if I have your name wrong, you know who you are. She helped me enormously (my Spanish is limited), always with extreme graciousness, and really made my stay a lot easier. The hotel offers Internet service in the lobby. Ok, I think it should improve its ability to print boarding passes for passengers, but this is minor. Again, this is not the Ritz, or any other 5-star hotel. But if you're watching your budget, and like quiet neighborhoods that are still convenient, and safe, his is an excellent choice. I agree with the very positive Frommer reivew. A great value for the price.

Location is really good : around 30 minutes walk to the Ramblas, 20 minutes to Barceloneta and being next to Ciudadela Park is also a plus. Note that hotel is also close to Estacio de Fran\u00e7a, which is the terminus for the train that links airport to city centre. We used this train connection and were happily surprised that it was for free (don't know why). Rooms : there are 13 rooms, which are all situated on the first floor (level above ground floor, I mean). Note that there is no lift, so for disabled persons this will be a problem. There is no real lobby as such : you check in at the counter of the bar / restaurant downstairs. About 8 rooms look out over an avenue towards the park. Note that hotel has two room categories : rooms on outer side of the building and rooms on inner side. 'Exterior' rooms are more expensive (about 12 euros per night). We had 2 double 'exterior' rooms and I wondered if I would book these again : you have indeed a nice view, but on the first night we were woken up by loud voices just below. Somebody thought it were the garbage people who passed by. The three following nights, we did not have this problem anymore. Traffic noise is not disturbing, neither did we hear noise from neighbors. Note that temperature was still moderate : we did not use the airco so cannot comment on how silent this is. I believe that size and decor of inner and outer rooms is similar : limited ! Room size was around 18 square meter max. Our double bed was 140 cm wide, which is significantly smaller then our king size at home, but didn't bother us too much. Have to admit that bathroom was in good shape and shower working well. There are rooms that are a bit larger > ask for a triple room, but you will need to pay more. Normal rate 85 euro per night. We received a 10% discount without even asking for a discount. Probably we got that since we booked 8 nights all together. This rate did not include breakfast. A continental breakfast was available in the restaurant downstairs at 5 euro per person and included a small bottle of orange juice, coffee/tea, a croissant, two slices of toast and butter and jam. Too much bread for me : would have appreciated some fruit or yogurt... Taking into account that I searched a lot for affordable accommodation, but it was difficult to find an acceptable (clean and a little bit comfortable) room below 130 euro.
