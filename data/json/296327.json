I then heard on my room above heels clicking hard and objects being dropped. Freaaaky! The first night i was so scared i spent the night in the lobby by the restaurant which was closed.

The location is very accessible to the tourist spots, and even if the hotel itself is not that big, it's very tidy and it has a friendly and safe ambience. It's my family's first time in Turkey (they came from Philippines for my wedding)and I was quite afraid the hotel wont meet their expectations. My family was even surprised to arrive in the room exactly as I have seen it in photos (I think it's even better!); plus they did personalize some stuffs in advance like my request for a 3rd bed for my nephew at no extra cost, extra slippers and robes, and of course, all our 3 rooms' LCD TV has a welcome banner for my family! The rooftop breakfast is perfect, the food and location is amazing. :) The hotel price is quite high, but it's worth every penny you spend.

It's in a pretty nice neighborhood. The (small) rooms are clean and some have nice views of spectacular mosques. In the context of the prices of other Istanbul hotels, the value is pretty good. Some of the people who work there are very nice and helpful Real Problems: Some of the people at the front desk are rude and extremely unhelpful. When a friend of mine, a Turkish-speaking local, called and asked to speak to me, the person at the front desk refused to look up the room that I was in and connect her to me and hung up on her. The \"business center\" is pretty inadequate. There are 2 computers but one was broken the entire week that I was there and the working was was so obsolete as to be difficult to use at times. It was hard to use it also because with only one computer, there was a long line. The line was longer because hotel staff members used it to chat on Skype while guests waited. The hotel tried to steer me towards the buffet breakfast without mentioning that, while it is complimentary for most people, it is a whopping (and hugely overpriced) 20 euros for people who book through Orbitz. It's also the only hotel in that price range that I know of that reuses the boxes for the soaps in the bathroom (sanitary?). In all, the location is pretty good and value is pretty good, but there are real issues to be aware of. And probably not the best place if you need to do business (have access to a fax machine or scanner) or if you want access to the internet through a hotel computer.", "Date": "November 1, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Cedar Rapids, Iowa", "Title": "\u201cAn outstanding view of the city plus a competent hotel all in one.\u201d", "Author": "mjrg59", "ReviewID": "UR119541210", "Content": "A not-so-big hotel in a good location that affords a fantastic view of Istanbul from its dining room and terrace.

Bathrooms are extra clean with hot and cold water. (unlike many 4star hotels in Istanbul, this one is 100% reliable for being clean and comfi beds).

Breackfast is very rich including all sorts of bread, eggs, hot and cold varieties and juices and coffee or tea and the service is very fast and people are very friendly and polite. The location is a bit far from the historical area (20mins tram ride) but compensated with bus station, taxi stop and tram station litrary at the door step, in addition to the option of the yellow minibusses passing by the doorstep. The area of findikzade is alive, with plenty of groceries and supermarkets for water and treats shopping, in addition to a large and good shopping mall just at the adjacent back street (u cant miss it).
