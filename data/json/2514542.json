Another 1 star for a decent bed. It loses stars for 1- heating. Despite travelling in late March my room was cold in the evenings due to a ridiculous 'air brick' above the window that was actually simply a foot-long slot in the wall that went straight outside. The electric radiator was the only heat source and this was directly below the window and particularly its curtains - most heat just got diverted straight behind the curtains and outside through the air brick. 2 - internet. No wifi firstly, just an ethernet cable so no luck if you're relying on smartphone. Secondly, it cost \u00a310 for 24hr slow internet access, or \u00a315 for something approaching reasonable speeds (or claimed, didn't try latter). Its not 1998 any more, the internet is no longer a luxury you can charge ridiculous sums for! Luckily work were paying for me, but I was still horrified by the cost. 3 - Plugs. Or rather 'plug'. My room had one plug, and this was on the opposite side of the room to the bed. I presume people saying in the Docklands are on business, and its a safe bet most of these have both a laptop and a smartphone that need charging at the end of the day. Good luck with one plug! When I asked reception for a double plug adaptor they tried giving me a shaving adaptor before giving up. Also breakfast was lacklustre, and I can only assume who ever did the internal decoration was colour blind.

The room and ensuite were both very cramped though clean. You certainly couldnt swing a cat! The bed wasnt particularly comfortable and i was cold. There were no extra blankets and the heating did not work - they had obviously switched it off. I was very annoyed to discover there was no Free WiFi unless you went downstairs and perched uncomfortably in the foyer. a password was needed but not offered - and they appeared rather reluctant to provide it. You could of course pay for landline access in your room. I was most annoyed though to find the only food was either Chinese or their so called pub, both of which looked pretty grisly.

The rooms have a bathroom which would be more suited to a touring caravan, don't expect to be able to move around freely in them. The bed was large and lumpy with an ill fitting thin duvet.

My room 218 had what appeared to be dried spit on the wall to the left of the painting at foot of bed. Disgusting. We stayed here alongside some athletes who must be in pre Olympics training. They took priority in the dining room at both evening and what is described as \"breakfast\" Staff constantly badger you whilst you attempt to eat the expensive but small portions of food they give you, enquiring if everything is ok. I asked if the rest of the starter was yet to come... A blank look from an equally blank member of staff was the response. Don't be caught out if you take your own car there, it's \u00a310 to park there per overnight... The most embarrassing thing I saw was a member of the Malaysian Olympic team who was having breakfast, we saw that he wanted to take his with him and he made a bacon sandwich and wrapped it in a couple of paper towels and was just about to walk out with it when a member of the waiting staff pounced on him and shouted at him in broken English that he would be charged and kicked out of hotel if he tried to steal the sandwich. Truly awful behaviour by the staff. The full English breakfast was vile. Cold smoked bacon which consisted of more fat than meat, some nasty smelling sausages, boiled to death mushrooms and the most watery scrambled egg I have ever seen.

The shower had a plastic screen that ran around a circular track so that you enclosed yourself in a narrow diameter tube to shower yourself. Claustrophobic and impractical for anyone tall or wide. My 6ft tall normal build husband could not bend his legs sufficiently to soap his feet. There was also a lip to step over to get into the room, and another one on the bathroom - both easy to trip over. Our room had a connecting door to the neighbouring room through which it was possible to hear every word our neighbours said. Finally I felt this hotel (which charged more than, say, the Holiday Inn Express chain) offered very poor value for money. I think this is the only time I have ever felt the need to rate a hotel this way.", "Date": "December 7, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Chesterfield, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cGood value for money\u201d", "Author": "norman869", "ReviewID": "UR121072180", "Content": "Having read previous reviews of this hotel, we discovered many issues unfounded.

I have no complaints about the room except that the shower was powerless, it took ages to get your hair washed. Also, the walls were quite thin and you could hear everything from the corridors and loud voices from other rooms. There was not that much people on our floor though and we got a good night's sleep every night. The continental breakfast was better than I expected. It contained apples, croissants, rolls, bread, yoghourt, cereales, coffee/tea/juice/water etc. The breakfast was served in a nice \"restaurant\" with big windows. The only thing that bothered us was that the staff was a bit too eager to clean the tables and barely waited for people to finish. For example, one morning I was eating my cereales and held the cup in my hand. The waiter came and asked \"Finish?\" and took my plate away though it still had a bit food on it. It might be a cultural thing though and we got a good laugh from it. Overall the hotel was clean. There were some stains in the corridor carpets but they still didn't look dirty. The pub and cafe downstairs were nice. The staff was averagely friendly, not too enthusiastic but not rude. The access to central london was good as the excel station and bus stop were just across the road.

So, I would say the location is fine, especially with a decent price through one of the major websites. The hotel itself is clean and the room was fine, albeit cramped. Small rooms are fine for us but this one, i'd have to say is fairly poorly designed. Stay in a B and B Hotel or Premiere Classe Hotel in France and you'll find an all in one bathroom/pod which means extra room within the actual hotel room. This hotel on the other hand had a separate shower, separate toilet and a wash basin in the room corner. It still works but just takes up more room than is needed in my opinion...but then others may like this separate style....all comes down to personal preference. Free baggage storage was also good and there is a pub attached to the hotel, and a chinese restaurant and a cafe. We ate at the pub and it's standard English mainstream pub food...absolutely fine but not exclusive food. Internet was extra cash. No idea of connection as we just went to EAT in town and used the free wifi there. Anyway, as mentioned, the hotel was clean, easy to find, easy to get around and good value for an expensive city like London.

Luckily, in this case, any negative reviews were completely erased upon walking into the room. Now, first, I should let you know I paid, as near as makes no difference, \u00a350 for a superior double room with continental breakfast. Hence, excellent value. The room itself was small but cosy. There was excellent storage space for clothing et. al. and most importantly, in mid July, the climate control air conditioning was excellent, a quiet cool lulled me to an excellent nights sleep on a comfortable bed. The toilet and shower facilities were also quite small but, sufficient. Indeed, the shower was very modern and very good, and, as a larger gentleman, I had no trouble fitting into the room, fitting onto the toilet, fitting in the shower, leaning over the sink to brush my teeth. There was sufficient room and excellent facilities. There was also a kettle (or tea and coffee making facilities as they call it). Which leant itself well given that, after a day out in the city, we fancied a cuppa. The location of the hotel may be a tad inconvenient for some people who wish to stay in London, however it is a very short journey from Tower Gateway DLR station, to Customer House for eXcel DLR station, and the hotel itself is literally across the road from the exit of the DLR station, and I mean literally, you exit the stairs from the station and cross the road directly to the door of the hotel. It was a fantastic location for our purposes, and our off-peak travel cards for zones 1-4 (the hotel is in zone 3) was only \u00a36.30, 70p more than a zones 1-2 travel card. I must reiterate, this is off-peak travel cards, and peak travel card prices may vary. We also dined in the Ho Lee chinese restaurant within the hotel, and the food was lovely. Overall I would recommend this hotel for, mostly short breaks. If you are planning a weekend in London with your partner or, even on your own, and you aren't wishing to go pupping and clubbing late at night then you cannot go wrong with this hotel and, do search for the cheapest rates for this hotel because I found prices from \u00a349 to \u00a3115 for rooms at this hotel and, our room, which we paid \u00a354 for, was also available for \u00a3115, that's about \u00a360 difference, that's a whole other night.

It was also quite noisy as we had a room at the front and could hear the noise/announcements from the DLR rain station from 6am onwards! We also found that the bed was quite hard and uncomfortable.

The beds were small, and we had to ask for extra pillows each, but no great hardship and we both slept on them fine (but I was glad to get back to my double kingsize!) Breakfast was coninental style with plentifull if not varied fare on offer. You can upgrade to full English for \u00a34.

The room was very small and basic but was also clean and well-kept. We were happy enough with the standard of the accommodation itself but I would not want to pay any more for it. In terms of standards, expect something approaching a slightly jaded Travelodge or Holiday Inn, which hasn\u2019t been decorated in a couple of years but which is acceptable nonetheless. The cubicle toilet and shower block is, as some other reviewers have noted, a little odd but this shouldn\u2019t put anybody off; in fact the shower was very good. The staff were always pleasant and one very kind lady in the adjoining pub lent us a corkscrew to open a bottle of wine. Unfortunately what lets Custom House Hotel down is its location. While the area in the immediate vicinity of the hotel is busy enough at most times of the day to feel safe, the streets behind the hotel are distinctly intimidating. There is a noticeably run-down feeling to anything north of Victoria Dock Road. There are only very limited amenities, in terms of shops and services, in the immediate vicinity and the neighbourhood does not feel safe enough for one to explore beyond this. We found ourselves simply dashing from the station back to the hotel on most nights. This security problem was compounded by the fact that the hotel restaurants were severely overpriced, so we found ourselves very limited in terms of eating options. On the plus side, you could not be closer to the DLR stop so access to central London is really quite easy. Equally, if you are visiting the exhibition centre, then this hotel is located just about as conveniently as you could hope. What is more, the local \u2018Southern Fried Chicken\u2019-type shop is excellent value, though twice in one week is probably too much cholesterol for anybody!

Here's our comments on The Custom House Hotel. Location For ExCel you won't get cheaper or better located than here. It is literally just across the DLR railway bridge. It was perfect for us. Booking We booked through a value hotel website (bookings is the name). The room was \u00a359 a night which, compared with \u00a3100 or so for the bigger name hotels. The hotel's own website charged \u00a380 or so - therefore I recommend shopping around. Parking We drove down to London and used the hotel's own car park. They charge \"\u00a310 a day or part thereof\". We assumed as we were going to be there over a Saturday/Sunday we would be charged \u00a320 but they only charged us \u00a310. We were happy with the car park - as someone else mentioned, it's not the loveliest of areas and not worth the risk of parking in a side street in my opinion Rooms I'm sure there are large, airy rooms in this hotel. However, for \u00a359 we neither expected, nor got one of these. My husband remarked that it was probably the smallest hotel room he'd ever stayed in. The toilet was very VERY similar to those that you get on a plane - with plastic walls. The sink was in the corner of the room next to the bed. The shower, although built the same as the toilet was lovely and hot with a powerful head. The bed was extremely comfortable and we had tea/coffee facilities plus a tv. The room was NOT airconditioned. However, the heater worked and the room was toasty after about 10 minutes. If you know you only want to sleep in this room you will have no cause for complaints. Don't however, book yourself a romantic break here! Overall This is really a value hotel that we booked for convenience and price. In my opinion it gave us exactly what we were looking for. It was not a luxurious experience, but neither was it terrible. It was just adequate for our requirements. You will not get beautiful views from your window and you will not be overwhelmed by your surroundings. However, for what it represents, we had no complaints and the next time we visit ExCel, we would have no hesitation of using the Custom House Hotel again.", "Date": "January 22, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Bucks, England", "Title": "\u201cGreat Value\u201d", "Author": "RabbitRoamer", "ReviewID": "UR23673464", "Content": "This is a large and modern Hotel opposite the ExCel exhibition centre and Custom House DLR stop.

The room cost was \u00a349 booked on \"late rooms\". I normally wouldn't bother writing reviews, but I do enjoy reading them (how selfish - I know), however I think I need to put the reviews here in context, and please bear in mind the \u00a349 room rate. Why am I here? Well, I am visiting Excel, only staying one night and the hotel proximity to Excel is as good as you can get, just a road and foot bridge away. I visited Excel about the same time last year and stayed in the Ibis after having some really good experiences at the Ibis at Gawick airport, but the Ibis was full. (\u00a380 cost last year) The room very much reminds me of the Ibis to be honest, they also love slot in showrooms, except Ibis's is fitted to a better quality and the shower is much bigger, the Custom House shower is more of a token gesture! The heating didn't work in my room, however a quick visit to reception and a few minutes later a portable electric heater arrived in my room, not too much of a problem. Internet is still \u00a315 for 24hrs, exactly the same rate as the Holiday Inn at gatwick airport, so pretty much par for the course, although many other hotels are either \u00a310 for 24hrs or include some kind of movies + internet package for \u00a315 Have just eaten in the cafe, was thinking of the Chinese option, but after hearing bad reviews on here for the cafe, I thought I would give it a go and see how bad it really is! Double burger, with bacon, cheese, large salad, fries for \u00a37.95? Sounds good value to me for a hotel, and it was good value, bacon was really good (and i'm a fussy bacon type of guy). Cafe seems to serve motorway service station kind of food, but much better than the Ibis at Excel, certainly in portion size. So to sum things up, should you stay here if you are planning to visit London and the sights/sites? no probably not, its too much of a journey by DLR, but if you cant find anything in London and this place is cheap, and you can suffer an hours DLR/Tube into London then fine, but don't hang around the hotel, there isn't much to do here, and the TV is not much good. Should you stay here on business, and visiting Excel? Well, if the company you work for is yours, yes, who wants to waste money! If someone else is paying the bill, then no, get somewhere more expensive (Novotel/Ibis for example).

After looking at a few hotels, we came across Custom House Hotel for \u00a349.95 per room, which was the cheapest hotel in that area on the day of our concert. We read the mixed reviews on Trip Advisor and decided that the more recent reviews seemed more promising than the earlier reviews and we confirmed our reservation through the website Laterooms.com. The hotel is situated right outside the Custom House DLR station which was great however there seemed to be building work happening outside the hotel which we weren\u2019t informed about when we made our booking. When we entered the hotel the receptionist checked us in quickly. She mentioned that we had to pay on departure but we had to provide a copy of our credit card details to confirm our stay at the hotel which translated to me as payment in case we decided to do a runner! We asked the obvious question of \u201cwhat approximate times do the builders start/finish every day?\u201d and the hotel staff said they didn\u2019t know. Personally I felt it was a question a lot of people would have asked considering it was happening at the hotel and felt they should have had at least a rough idea. Thankfully it didn\u2019t really affect us as we were out in the evening and were leaving the next morning. The reception had lots of information for attractions and also a vending machine with handy items for guests during their stay such as toothbrushes, hair gel etc. The room we were given was a superior double room which sleeps 2 with breakfast not included. The room was en-suite, spacious, air-conditioned and clean. The beds were clean and comfortable and had 2 pillows with a spare pillow and blanket in the draws under the bed. The room had a wardrobe with hangers and a safe in the bottom of it which they hotel charges 2 GBP to use. There were tea and coffee facilities in the room with some biscuits, a TV with basic channels (BBC1 + 2, ITV, Channel 4, Five + TMF music channel), telephone, hairdryer, travel adapter & internet access which the hotel charged 15.00 GBP!!!!! The bathroom was quite clean apart from the toilet seat which had a rather unpleasant stain on it. The hotel provided us with shampoo, soap & a shaving port. The shower cubicle was pretty small as quite a few reviewers have mentioned but it wasn\u2019t really a problem. We checked out at 11am and we had to wait a short while but reception apologised for the wait and proceeded in checking us out. Unfortunately they decided to charge me more than I was quoted on the website. Thankfully I printed out my Laterooms reservation and showed them how much I was quoted and after a quick chat with her manager, the receptionist said they were willing to charge me the price I was originally quoted.

Stains on the bed valances and sheets,no literature,lousy television picture,very sparse tea/coffee making sachets ( 2 of each) water from tap tasted awful. We were on the 5th floor so heres a good one, i rang room service to ask for an extra pillow, the reply was - would i collect one from reception when i passed by. We returned to the hotel at 11pm and we had to ask them to open the bar so we could get a drink. Worse still at 4am they decided to take an overflow from another hotel, the people who got the room next to ours never stopped talking,singing and shouting until by 6:15 we had had enough. We packed our bags and checked out, so i cant comment on the breakfast because we never had it. We only stayed at this hotel because it was near the O2 arena, we would have travelled 100 miles on a horse and cart over a cobbled road to get there had i known this hotel was this bad.

The carpet in the room was stained and there was a sink in the room which was full of hairs. Behind the sink there was a build up of dirt/dust. We asked reception for another room but were told that there were no other rooms available. The bed was very uncomfortable with a very flimsy stained overblanket. The lighting was poor in the room. There were 4 hangars in an open closet for hanging clothes which were not strong enough to hold a coat... The coat kept falling down on the floor. We complained the next morning as we were booked for three nights. The reception staff were totally uninterested and simply advised us that no other rooms were available over the 3 days. We then headed off for breakfast..... the staff were unbelievably rude, did not even answer when asked for cutlery. The cooked breakfast room was too small for the guests so we were rudely redirected to a room at the end of the corridor which was even worse as they had no food left and this was very early..... People were standing around waiting for a seat, cutlery, cups. There was a coffee machine but no cups available for 20 minutes. After 20 minutes we left the breakfast rooms in disgust. I completed the customer service card left in the room and handed it into reception and asked if someone would contact me. Needless to say we never heard back from anyone.

Location We were at an event at the ExCel arena and this hotel cannot be faulted for location, it is literally across the road. I think it is the nearest hotel to the arena, which meant no messing around with taking tubes or parking. The hotel is located in a dodgy run down East End area. I chose to park my car on Ethel Street, which is directly behind the hotel, although I did so apprehensively. The morning after we saw another car's window smashed and plenty of suspect characters milling about, so I'd suggest biting the bullet and paying the \u00a310 daily charge to park in the secure hotel car park or park in the ExCel arena's own multi-storey for \u00a39 per day. Staff When we checked in, I encountered a strange situation. The receptionist presented me with a printed bill, which I found odd because I had already paid \u00a360 for the room through an Internet site a week previously. When I saw the new bill came to \u00a335, I was a little perturbed to say the least. When I mentioned to the receptionist that I had already paid for the room, he hastily said this was the 'wrong bill' and sheepishly took it away. It was obvious that he was lying. Although angry about being charged almost double the price, I would have settled for the truth rather than a lie. The restaurant and cleaning staff were efficient, but don't expect decent service or even a conversation from them. Food The Custom House Hotel's idea of continental breakfast is a choice of three cereals, orange juice, tap water, machine coffee, yoghurt and cheap bread, which was adequate but they're not going to get any Michelin stars here. To sum up, we only stayed a night and didn't spend much time in the hotel so if that's what you plan to do then it's fine. Plus it was the cheapest hotel in the area. But if you're planning to stay for longer than a night or like your creature comforts then steer clear of this place.", "Date": "November 28, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "1", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "1", "Check in / front desk": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "UK", "Title": "\u201cThe worst hotel in London\u201d", "Author": "eww", "ReviewID": "UR6155632", "Content": "This hotel is like a turd in gift wrapping. It looks fine from the outside, but inside it's disgusting. The 'superior' room that I was allocated had cheap, nasty furniture, a plastic sink screwed into the corner of the room and separate toilet and shower rooms made from moulded plastic that looked like public conveniences. The furniture made the room look like a ferry cabin and it was about the same size. It needed a good paint - or firebombing. The heater, table (again plastic and screwed to the wall), windowsill and telephone were filthy and there were some pretty dubious stains on the carpet too. The bedding was polyester. The 'continental' breakfast consisted of a choice of 3 cereals, some hard boiled eggs and cubes of cheese plus some yoghurts that were clearly not made anywhere in an english speaking country. A bargain for \u00a34.50. I was glad at least that the lock on the door worked, because the rest of the clientele were, quite frankly, terrifying. The staff were indifferent at best.

The bedding was good quality, tea and coffee in all rooms, bathrooms are modular pods, but clean and functional and although breakfast isn't great - it's what you would expect for the price. The best thing however is the LOCATION - We were attending World Travel Market at Excel. The hotel is 4 minutes walk from the main entrance - after years of travelling in from Central London which at rush hour can take some time and effort - it is fantastic. Any concerns around the hotel are pushed out of your mind. If you do need to go into central London you can be in Bank in 15 minutes or for the west end, change at Canning Town to the Jubilee Line to Green Park and it will take 20-30 mins off peak - ideal. All this for around \u00a360 per night incl breakfast - bargain!!!", "Date": "November 9, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "2", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Devon", "Title": "\u201cYou get what you pay for\u201d", "Author": "DavidinDevon", "ReviewID": "UR5920098", "Content": "The only saving grace about this hotel is the price.

Where to start?? Yes, it's true that this hotel is located across from the rail station......but it is a good 30 min ride to the center of London and it involves a switch to the tube. This hotel is too far away from anything! The neighborhood around it is very depressed with boarded up buildings and lots of trash everywhere. The room itself is ok.....except for no A/C and a very strange pre-fab bathroom. Kind of like you'd expect to find in a motorhome. The breakfast was ok but nothing special. I would never stay here again because it is just too far from ANY attraction. If you're spending so much money to visit London...why stay in a location so far removed from anything to see? There is nothing to do here at night and it didn't really look safe to venture out at night anyway. This hotel is so far from London that the morning we were leaving our bus driver was 45 minutes late because he couldn't even find the hotel. Don't stay here. I'm sure you can do better just about anywhere else!", "Date": "September 3, 2006"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Custom House Hotel", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g186338-d248796-Reviews-Custom_House_Hotel-London_England.html", "Price": "$93 - $310*", "Address": "<address> <span rel=\"v:address\"> <span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">272-283 Victoria Dock Road</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:locality\">London</span> <span property=\"v:postal-code\">E16 3BY</span></span>, <span class=\"country-name\" property=\"v:country-name\">England</span> </span> </span> </address>", "HotelID": "2514542", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/ProviderThumbnails/dirs/09/b0/09b02de43ee2a9b517670b52d989f2757large.jpg"}}
