The staff is really nice and accommodating - helpful if you need anything. BUT, for the price and reputation (we spent 300 for a king regular room)- it is disappointing. The rooms/hallways have a musty smell- almost like mildew. The bathroom/shower combo was super tiny, lacking what you would expect from a hotel of this caliber. The rooms were outdated - especially the bathroom. Also- I scheduled a mani/pedi in the salon - which felt old and outdated as well. For both services it was $100- would definitely not waste my money again on this. Thought it would be a greater experience being the El San Juan and all.

Think of a cross between the glass art of Dale Chihuly and classic Hemingway Key West. Great first impression. Next the room by the pool. Total econolodge motiff. Dirty towels behind the bathroom door. Black mold seeping out between ceiling tiles. Squishy bathtub(?). Filthy like I've never encountered before. An \"intimacy\" kit that my two kids found on the nightstand. Classy stuff. No vibrating bed though. We tried to make the best of it, kept our mouths shut and went to the pool. Totally mediocre and Spring break like. Not our type of place. We went to the beach. Overcrowded and not very pretty. Back to the room. We can't take it and pack up and leave. We tell the manager(nice lady)we're outta here and they put us in a suite in the main building. An improvement, the rooms much cleaner, but tired looking and in need of some touch ups. I call my sister in he states, whose been to San Juan several times, and tell her i need a place to eat. At this point im not risking eating here. She says there's a fabulous Italain Restaurant actually in the El San Juan. We're tired. We go there to eat. I'm absolutely floored. From beginning to end its a 10! An absolutely perfect meal. I swear I'm flying back to San Juan just for this restaurant. We had breakfast at Starbucks because Italian restaurant was closed and I just couldnt press my luck.

I just returned from 6 nights here and I would NEVER go back...nor would I recommend it to anyone! The place was grubby and the lobby bathrooms were filthy. They smelled disgusting and were definitely not cleaned regularly. My room was near the elevator on the 6th floor (although my Hilton Honors profile says that I prefer to be away from the elevator). There was a terribly annoying (almost like nails on a blackboard after 6 days) squeaking door behind the elevators, that sounded like it was in my room. It must have been used by the service staff because it happened all day and all night. It drove me nuts. I was told the hotel was full so I could not move. The pools were beautiful but it was very difficult to get a lounge chair. There was a sign near the towel house that said that pool staff would clear lounge chairs at 9:30 am...I assume to free up chairs that were not being used so that they would be available for others. I never saw anyone do that. As a matter of fact, there was a man's shirt sitting on a lounge chair for 2 days and no one ever moved it. The pool cleaner actually tried it on to see if he should take it but it was too big for him. He threw it back on the chair and left it there. I guess it would have been OK for him to take it if it fit, but it never crossed his mind to turn it into the Lost & Found??? The majority of lounge chairs had towels on them but were not being used. On the Saturday of my visit, it poured rain all day. I spent quite a bit of time in my room since there was not much else to do. The service staff spent hours in the hallways laughing and fooling around...they were very noisy. It was clear to me that most of the employees were more interested in socializing with their coworkers rather than doing their jobs. Guests were not their priority. Although the pools were very nice and they were cleaned every morning, on my last day at the resort, I saw some weird film/sludge near one of the filters. It was gross and I have no idea what it was.

When it came time to check out, they had no record of charging a deposit. Finally, after a 35 minute conversation with the front desk, they found the charge and then were supposed to put the remainder of the charges on my card. The receipt had my name, credit card number and signature on it. Traveling with six girls, I spent the time to split up the difference and each one was to pay me a sum. It is a cumbersome process. Two months after we return from our trip, one of my friends who had put down her card only to get into the room and had asked several times for it not to be charged, was actually charged the difference minus the deposit. With no signature, no conversation, nothing. Then, the hotel calls me with my friend on the line and says can we now charge your card instead of your friends with no mention of a credit card authorization form or other indication that I am in fact the owner of my credit card and can be charged. Other examples of rude staff include ladies at the Italian deli chatting with each other instead of fixing any food, even when you are standing there and waiting for your order.

I did not go to the casino, I walked through it. The hotel itself is clean and modern - rooms were very comfortable. My room on the third floor had a cement, enclosed patio to hide a very ugly view of the flat top roof filled with vents and a/c condensers. Bedding is great and I had three good nights of sleep. Bathrooms were beautiful and modern- well lit and again, clean. We initially asked for two doubles, but they did not have a room available, so my sister and I shared a king bed - not the end of the world, but not ideal. The pool area is beautiful and well kept - give or take a few cups in the pool at the end of the day. The property itself is stunning. The average rating is because they charge ALOT for EVERYTHING. You want WiFi - there is a fee; you want a beach chair - there is a fee; you want a pad on the old, beat up beach chair - there is a fee. This is a high end resort and the room rates should include these things- don't nickle and dime me. If you want bottled water on the beach, expect to pay $8 for it. There is no coffee maker in the room, so if you want coffee, you either order room service ( a pot of coffee was like $19 or close to that) or you endure a long line at Starbucks in the lobby, where you still pay 4 dollars. Meals in the hotel are very expensive - even lunch for two at the outdoor cafe (on paper plated and with plastic cups) ran nearly $80 - for salads and a beer. The resort crowd while I was there was also a little rowdy and rude - I like to have a good time, but there were people so drunk they had to be carried out of the pool area. And if you are there during an event - like a wedding or party, expect to be ignored by the wait staff. They are busy. Also, if you want a cabana or poolside seating, you will need to get up at 5AM to 'stake it out' by putting your stuff there - kind of a bummer. People stay in these things all day long then give them to friends, so don't expect to actually USE the beautiful seating shown on the website. One upside- if you are there for a short trip, the resort is about 7 minutes from the airport, so you can land at noon and be on the beach with a drink in your hand by 12:30. The beach itself is pretty and offers good swimming (there was seaweed on two of my 4 day stay, but that goes with the territory...) Cabs are not cheap. Expect to pay about $20 in cab fare to get there from the airport, and another $20 -$25 to get to old San Juan.

I have to say they had an awesome time! I got up every morning to have my ice coffee and oatmeal at starbucks.

Honestly, I didn't go to an island to sit by a pool with other screaming kids, so finding all the pool chairs taken by 7:30 didn't bother me. I came to see the beautiful beach. yes, there was seaweed, but most of it was cleaned up. what bothered me was the truck that came on the beach to clean it up while people were on the beach. that kind of thing should be done at 6:00/7:00 am. not 9:30-10:00! There were also other vehicles driving up and down the beach which annoyed me. the kids favorite part of the trip was taking a break from the beach and hanging out at the hot-tubs which were next to a waterfall. my kids met other kids there and took tons of pictures. lots of fun for them. probably not fun for the adults that wanted to be there. the other thing they loved was the banana boat ride. they took endless rides with other kids. their favorite place to eat was by the barbeque cart on the beach. He had hot-dogs, hamburgers, shrimp, chicken and talapia. and water bottles for $1.00. prices for food ranged from $4.00-$12.00. all very resonable. As far as the rooms, they were outdated and yes there were some stains and rips in the upholstery and linens, but kids didn't care and i was just there to sleep and keep watch. carpet in the hallway of the rooms smelled like someone had spilled champagne on it and there were stains there too. my kids loved the lobby. they would hang out there with other kids they met and take pictures, people watch, dance a little, and horse around. it was everything they wanted. they didn't want to leave. the price per night was definitely higher than the quality of the hotel. I also priced other islands and for $250 a night, and you get less for your money, so I don't think it wasnt so over the top expensive. would i go back, absolutely not. would my kids. of course. and as far as I'm concerned, it's all about the kids! :)", "Date": "April 14, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "2", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Tel Aviv, Israel", "Title": "\u201cDeteriorating Hotel + ($400 per reg room) Expensive + countless Scamy billing errors\u201d", "Author": "Sagees", "ReviewID": "UR127695287", "Content": "I flew to Porto Rico for My little brother's bachelor party. There were 10 of us staying in the hotel from Thursday March 29th - April 1, 2012 I can pretty much right a book about this one. This hotel just about got it all wrong. I give a short summery for those who dont have time to read the long review. The Good: 1. Beds are great! 2. Rooms are quite even though there is a huge party going on in the lobby every night. 3. The people giving out towels were really nice The Bad: 1. They got our reservation wrong. Both the number of rooms and the number of nights. 2. Rooms are EXTREMELY expensive for what you get. 3. The hotel is run down and falling apart. 4. Breakfast is $25 a person, its freaking porto rico. 5. Right by the airport, so planes are going over your head every 5 minutes 6. No chance of getting a pool chair after 9:00 am. 7. Hotel recommended an all day boat trip on \"traveler\" brand boat at $100 per person. Was the worst boat trip i have ever taken in my life. TRAP TRAP TRAP!!!!! 8. The hotel night club will not let you in without a button down shirt. 9. Really scamy charges come up from the mini bar, restaurant and other places. None of them took place and it take the hotel days to get back to you. 10. Shower cutain is 100% cotton, WTF?? it does not keep the water in and also gets soaked. 11. Any decent restaurant is a long cab away. More Details: The Bad: 1. They got our reservation wrong. Both the number of rooms and the number of nights. We booked five bed rooms with two double beds in each room. What we got was four bed rooms with some in king and some double. That meant some of our friends had to choose between sleeping in a king together, or sleeping on a cot. It could be worse, but at $400 a night, you have to be kidding me. We booked three nights and on the seconds night they came to check us out. For some reason they screwed up the reservation for several of the rooms and had them for two nights instead of three. Mind you the reservation was made as one. Actually, my dad organized everything. He confirmed and reconfirmed with the hotel several times before arrival. 2. Rooms are EXTREMELY expensive for what you get. The rooms are decent, but $400 a night is ludicrous. The bathroom is very small and the room is not that big either. The view was horrible from our window. As you can see from the photos, you can see the hotel rotting away in front of your eyes, not to mention an ugly hump is hiding the view of the ocean which is the only thing you are supposed to see in the first place. 3. The hotel is run down and falling apart. Check out the photos. This place needs a renovation ASAP. The lobby is pitch black. It's as ugly and non fitting a tropical resort as you can get. The hallways have 30 year old carpeting that smells. The rooms are in need of a serious make over, especially the curtains. The outside walls are rotting and suffer serious discoloration. 4. Breakfast is $25 a person, its freaking porto rico. Nothing more to say about this one. I didnt have it. 5. Right by the airport, so planes are going over your head every 5 minutes There is some convenience in having the resort close to the airport, but all that goes away the second you get to the pool or beach and are inundated with constant take off and landing jet noise. 6. No chance of getting a pool chair after 9:00 am. We were a group of 10 friends. Some got up early, others later. No one got to the beach before 8:00. But at 9:00 am, there is no change of getting a pool chare. They are all take. I dont know who takes them, but its seems that there are more chares than bends in the hotel. In any case, unless you want to get into a fight with someone who placed their towel on the chair at night to save a seat, sit on the floor. 7. Hotel recommended an all day boat trip on \"traveler\" brand boat at $100 per person. Was the worst boat trip i have ever taken in my life. TRAP TRAP TRAP!!!!! This was actually the low point of the trip. We thought it would be just the opposite, but just let the El San Juan surprise you it will not miss the opportunity to disappoint. This was not a cheap trip at $100 a person, so we thought it would be a nigh day adventure. It included transportation to and from the boat, snorkeling, all equipment, food and drinks for the entire day. The trip started at an early 7:30 am departure from the hotel. Not so night when you are on vacation. A very old large bus picked us up. We waited till people got on and then ventured further to pick some more people till all 50 spaces were occupied. Then we were off to the boat destination. The driver spoke up and let us know that i would be an hour from now to reach our point of interest. An hour?? Where is this place?? well it turns out the trip was an hour because the bus cant do over 35 MPH. I dont know how they let this automobile on the road. In any case, we arrive exhausted from an ever so slow bus ride. Some old hag gets on the bus and tells us we have to pay and sign some release from, so every person single file gets on a 50 person Q to pay and sign. That took another 45 minutes. You would think they could have freaking taken care of that on the hour bus ride!!!!???? Onwards. Some old hag greats us and starts talking in a very annoying teacher like tone. Everyone just wants to go back to the hotel at this point, lets cut out losses, and now we get this hag. She starts spitting out rules, dont sit here but sit there, do that but not this. And here is the most annoying one of all. She tells everyone that she values recycling, im sure we all do, but she continues, \"please keep your plastic cut for the whole trip.\" Are you F%^@ING kidding me??? So get this, there are 50 people on the boat, you have to fight for a place to sit, seriously, there is room for 20 people to sit, the other 30 have to stand. So we have to find a safe place for our crappy throw away plastic cup for the next 6 hours??? Then we start sailing, that was actually kind of nice for 10 minutes as the boat was finally on its way and at a nice speed. Then it started raining, and not a drizzle, a torrential downpour. We were all freezing cold and there was not room for everyone under the cover. We were really suffering, this was not about fun not fun, this was just suffering. Then we get to the first snorkeling destination and jump in the water ASAP, as the water is warmer than the outside temp. Guess what, there is no quarrel reef here. Its a freaking joke. There are no fish here either. This is tons of dead rock and sandy water you cant see much in. Lunch: not only was it a sorry collection of cheap, stale, crappy rolls and an equivalent supply of ham cold cuts, but we had to get on line to make our own Sh#@ sandwich. It took you 40 minutes to get through. All kidding aside, they must have spent $30 USD for all the materials for the food. A royal joke. Ill spare you the rest of the trip, it just got worse and worse until there was a mutiny and all 50 of us just requested to go home ASAP. Not quite done with this one. We get on the bus, soaking wet and there are two people missing. Turns out that two gals booked a back to back trip with this company and they wanted to cancel the second trip ASAP after they experienced what \"travel\" brand had to offer. They did not want to get on the bus before the manager got them cash back. So one of the employees had to trive to an ATM and get them cash. That tool another 45 minutes. And then all was had was a 1.5 hour bus ride back home. Why was it an extra half hour more than the bus ride their you ask, well, we hit rush hour :). 8. The hotel night club will not let you in without a button down shirt. We reserved a $500 table at the nigh club, thats right, $500/table minimum charge. Its Porto Rico which is apparently more expensive than NYC. I came down dressed with a Polo shirt and that did not make the cut. 9. Really scamy charges come up from the mini bar, restaurant and other places. None of them took place and it take the hotel days to get back to you. We had $500 of scamy charges comes from all sorts of places. a. The restaurant at the hotel. Extra charges of $200 from what the hotel found was the table next to us. b. Room charges for internet when we didnt even have laptops. and our phones were working fine on our US carrier data. c. Charges from ordering food and drinks from the lobby, when we never did that. All the charges were refunded, but it seems like the hotel tries to get away with this, especially with large parties. 10. Shower cutain is 100% cotton, WTF?? it does not keep the water in and also gets soaked. Every time i took a shower, the curtain was soaked and the bathroom floor was flooded. Also, the shower head is very cheap and does not slay in place. You have to magiver it to stay in one position and the water pressure is also aggravatingly low. 11. Any decent restaurant is a long cab away. There is no decent local food that is walking distance away. You have to get a long cap ride to eat decent local food, which is actually pretty mediocre anyway.", "Date": "April 11, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "New York, NY", "Title": "\u201cAwesome trip all around!\u201d", "Author": "rochelle4881", "ReviewID": "UR127684716", "Content": "I honestly do not know where all of these bad reviews are coming from.

The beach is five steps from the pool and you get fress chairs there as well! On our first day we didn't get to the beach until 3:30ish and were still able to get chairs there. How on earth can anyone complain about seaweed on a beach?! This is not the hotel's fault, it is mother nature's!! The beach was beautiful and the water was blue. There was a lot of seaweed one day while we were there, but again...how is this the hotel's fault? There is waitress service by the beach as well. And the pool is so close, we went from the ocean to the pool often. On our last day we did get the comfy chairs by the pool. I went downstairs at 8:00 am and several chairs were still open. The weekends were a lot more crowded, but it's the weekend! I will say, I did see the pool boys give aways chairs that had towels on them and nothing else, which is what should be done. You can't expect to put towels on a chair at 6:00 am and not come down until noon. The staff was all super nice at the pool and the food and drinks were tasty! Nothing seemed dirty to me and we were in the pool and hot tub. My only complaint would be that there were children in the hot tub. Brother Jimmy's: Awesome as well! Open air rooftop bar. It's a NY chain, but had a little Puerto Rican flair. The bar tenders were all super nice and funny! The Staff: Everyone I dealt with was nothing but nice! Everyone said hello when we saw them. Cabs were called in 30 seconds. My boyfriend and I mentioned to Josue when we checked in that we were there celebrating both of our birthdays and when we walked into our room Saturday night after dinner we had champagne, cake and chocolate covered strawberries waiting for us! Such a nice touch - thank you Josue!! Surrounding Area: The strip is nice and safe. There are not too many authentic Puerto Rican places though. It's all chains. We weren't there to eat at Chili's or Burger King. There were a couple of mom and pop type Puerto Rican places that were really good, but if you want authentic food, spend $20 and take the short cab to Old San Juan (there is a bus too). I had my doubts about the El San Juan based on the reviews, but I seriously don't know where they are coming from!

We booked through a third party, and the deal made us give it a try. I stayed at the Ritz Carlton with my family last year, so unfortunately, I did some comparing. It was not horrible, but the level of service is not up to par. My bed covering had a small blood stain on it. In my opinion, a quality hotel would not allow that to be used. It should have been discarded! On a few days, it appeared that housekeeping barely cleaned the room. They left washcloths in the shower, so I guess that means they never really washed the shower. The bathroom sink was not thoroughly cleaned. One evening we tried to get coffee in one of the restaurants that was in the Galleria, which is attached to the hotel. Although they were not supposed to close for another 20 minutes, we were told that their boss told them that they could close early, since there was no business. There was no place in the hotel to get coffee. We asked at the lobby bar if we could get coffee, and we were told that the kitchen area was closed. On another evening, we were impressed by the service at the lobby bar at the InterContinental Hotel. When we asked for coffee, the bartender went out of his way to get us a coffee, and was creative in getting us a to-go cup. We were not even guests in that hotel, but their bartender tried a little bit harder than our own hotel did. We never had the option of getting a chair by the pool, and it was not even a weekend. They do not have enough seating by the pool. There was a limited lunch menu at the pool. There was only one salad option. We inquired about where to shower if we needed to stay later on our last day, and we were told that some times you can shower at the tennis courts, but that it is not always open. You can shower at the fitness center, but there is a charge to shower and use the locker room! I have never heard of such a thing. Many folks like to go to the beach and take a later flight home. Usually the hotel offers a place to change and shower, without a fee. I know that I cannot compare this hotel to the Ritz Carlton, but at the Ritz, any time you pass an employee in a lobby, or by the pool, they give you a big smile and say hello. I often felt that some employees actually tried to avoid making eye contact.

I want to make this as simple as possible. I read the reviews before going to El San Juan and was nervous about the trip. Honestly, this hotel is OLD and really needs to be revamped. I bet it was a hot-spot in the 70's or 80's but WOW it sure needs some help now. If you can afford it- i STRONGLY suggest you to stay at The Ritz which is right next door. If i ever make it back to PR (which is doubtful...so many better placed to go <turks and caicos> i would stay in Ritz. We requested a \"renovated\" room based on reviews from other on Trip Advisors. However, \"renovated\" rooms are located in the towers and are prety gross. Postives on Room: -bed was very comfortable so we were happy with that. Yep, thats about the only positive. Negatives on Room: -YES (as others have said) gross moldy showers....we showered with flip flops all week. -No balcony -Scuffed furniture, dirty, old looking. Poor choice in decor!! - toilet flusher was hard to flush and shower head was also hard to turn on. If an elderly couple were in our room it would be very hard to turn shower on/off and flush toilet. -maids need to really clean in the crevices better....corners of room etc. There was hair on floor when we arrived. Skeeved me out. The concierge was very nice but other employees were not helpful. It was as if we were \"bothering\" them when we approached them with questions and concerns. POOL/BEACH: Postivies: -pool chairs are large and super comfortable - thats about it. Negatives: -some kids POOPED in the pool....and the guy scooped it out but there was no further chemicals put into the pool. Gross. -Weekend chair situation was A JOKE. My sister inlaw was up at 615am saving chairs. During the week you could go down at 7am. VERY BAD SITUATION with people reserving chairs. -Only 2-3 umbrellas at the pool....and it was HOT. They should get more umbrellas!!! -Beach had seaweed all over....stay by pool (if you can get a chair). RANDOM NOTES: -Brother Jimmy's on rooftop is AWESOME. Open air, good drinks, etc. Definitely check it out!! -Casino was decent. -Lobby bars are ok. -Prices of food and drinks were typical...you're on vacation so expect to spend $$$. -Walgreens very close which was great!!! - We took a one day flight to St Thomas (and St John) at 6am and returned at 7pm.

After reading all of the negative comments on TripAdvisor leading up to our trip, I was extremely nervous about what our experience would be. Now, to be clear, this hotel is completely different on Sunday-Thursday noon than it is from Thursday noon to Sunday afternoon. The weekdays are quiet and the bar area was completely dead. On Thursday night through the weekend, the bar area is packed, band is playing and Bravo is bringing in a ton of young people ready to party. (We met people who said that Saturday night was loud and crazy in the halls and they had to complain to the manager.) I can honestly say that our 5-night stay was fantastic. We stayed Sun-Fri on the 7th floor in the tower with connecting rooms. The rooms were clean, comfortable and quiet. For the pool area, you have to get there early to get a chair, especially on Fridays and Saturdays. The bar drink prices were standard for a resort like this but I did take advantage of the earlier comments and get some beers at the store across the street. (True story: Medella Light beers at the bar are $7 each with tip. They are $4 for a six-pack at the store.) The breakfast bar was good and clean and the service was fine. The beach area had stinky seaweed on it but you could walk down the beach and find clean areas. On Thursday morning, a truck came through and cleaned up the entire beach in front of the hotel so everything was clean for us. (Probably cleaning it up for the weekend crowd.) I booked excursions (ziplining, snorkeling, etc.) but did it all online before we went. Did not go through the hotel as this just increased the price. Overall, everything was great for us.

A week prior to our trip, the light went off, and we began to read all of the reviews and was terrified. We called our 3rd party to attempt to change hotels before getting there, but it was going to cost us more money. She and I decided to stick with our plans and hope for the best. Well, the day of the trip, she was unable to catch the same flight as my family and I (losing one night stay). My family and I arrived at the resort at about 11:25 or so. The lobby was BEAUTIFUL, something to die for!!! The check in process was great, and I was given $100.00 hotel credit.......yay!!! I booked the garden lanais room. Here's where the disaster begins.............we had to walk through what appeared like a jungle to get to our room. The building had an odor to it, and you could tell it was old. Even the elevator had an odor. Once I entered the room, my allergies immediately began to act up. The floor had to be full of dust and dust mites, there were some stains in the carpet, and the smell........that alone was enough for me. I called the 3rd party (whom I booked my reservation), and they called the hotel to have me moved to another room. We were moved to a city vista, which was actually worse!!! Mind you it is well after midnight, we are tired, sleepy, hungry and aggrevated. The white, was a dingy white; the bathroom toilet had pubic hair on the toilet; the shower floor had black stains in the caulk, ewwwwwww; the pillow on my daughter's bed had stains on it; the white sofa had stains on it as well. We had no choice but to stay there until morning. The kids and I slept fully clothed. That morning will on the phone with my 3rd party to change hotels immediately, I walked out on the patio (which appeared to be the roof or something), and there was an unwrapped condom on the patio. I was livid!!!! The hotel manager Yvonne wanted to move us to another room..........NOT!!! I want out!!! If their cleaning skills were subpar in 2 rooms, what in the devil made them think I wanted to try a 3rd?????!!!!!!! We moved to the San Juan Marriott, which was like Heaven compared to what we experienced the night before. NEVER AGAIN!!! To think this is a Hilton property and is ranked with 4 or more stars, is scarey. I've stayed at a better La Quinta Inn. Instead of a resort............this is more like the Bates Motel.

It seemed as if everything in the room was updated except the shower tiles. The on demand did not work as well. The pool was beautiful. One major complaint I have which Susan is aware of Is the availability of pool chairs with shade. The first day I went to the gym and then to the pool. At 7am... Yes 7am on a Monday every single pool Chair with the pretty white fabric overhang had towels on them except 3 as if they were taken. No guests to be seen but towels on every one except 3. I have dark skin and the sun gets very strong. You need shade. The other pool not with a pool bar has literally 2 umbrellas. Tuesday we set our alarms for 6:15am just to get a chair. We went down and nothing was available. Either they don't have enough chairs for their guests or guests are getting up at 6am, placing towels on chairs and going back to sleep. Who wants to get up at 6 on vacation?!?! The beach is very nice besides the 3 feet of sea weed when entering. Even though this is not the resorts fault they could rake the excess on the sand. Beach chairs are free umbrellas $10 each room charge. You are forced to buy the umbrella or You will bake. All the restaurants and pool bars are expensive. As to be expected, but this put A bad taste in our mouths. We split Half a burger at the pool bar, $13, it doesn't come with fries so that is an additional $5, one 8oz cup of coke loaded with ice, $4, one medalla light beer $5. It came out to about $34 with tax and tip to split a burger for lunch. Mojitos are $12 each, small plastic 8oz cups filled with ice. We dined at KoKo's next to the casino. It was excellent. Very expensive but delicious. We had two entrees and 1 appetizer no drinks just flat water. $77 around. The appetizer was scallops, it came with 3, for $18 for the appetizer alone. We dined at La Piccola Fontana the Italian Restaurant. One appetizer and two entrees $70. No drinks. Very good though. $20 can ride each way into Old San Juan. Go to Walgreens down the block Buy yourself the $10 collapsible Cooler and the 12 pack of medalla light cans for $9.99. There is an ice bucket and ice on the room floor. Eat at Mi Casita in the Ponderosa/Burger King Parking lot a block down across from Interconntinental. Or Metropol in the opposite direction a block down. Affordable, authentic, and delicious. It's just really ashame you have to put in time and work just to make it affordable. We gambled at the casino. Just the two of us were playing roulette. I played black and a number. My number hit and it was black. The dealer paid me on my color but not my number. I brought it to her attention and she played like she was confused. She eventually paid me. That was my last hand. I dont know if she was day dreaming or just trying to scam me. I brought it to the casino manager's attention. Upon checkout, we asked for a cab for two to the airport. A van that seats 8 pulls up. Two women standing next to us over heard us saying we are going to the airport. They asked us to split the cab to save us all money. The cab driver and the man that calls the cabs over who works for the hotel informed us since we told him two they will have to charge $12 for each couple plus $1 each piece of Luggage. We did not agree. It was supposed to be $12 plus $1 each piece of luggage. We were told The cab drivers are all in line and the other driver has to take the other couple. They all work closely together scamming one at a time. Instead of accommodating us, which we would have left him a nice tip they told us no after our luggage was in the van. The driver wanted his buddy in line to make the other $12. Even though Susan was very accommodating, unfortunately it takes more then one professional to clean that resort up.

There are a couple of chain restaurants in the hotel, the prices at the El San Juan are twice as high as the Manhattan locations. Second of all, the service is terrible.

I pushed back politely because my computer hadn't had a problem connecting to any other networks that day.

Essentially wasting our night out, our ability to enjoy the entertainment in the hotel lobby, and causing us to rush down dinner at one of their restaurants at a late hour when no one was in the restaurant and the restaurant was about to close. The concierge was neither apologetic nor helpful and was quite unprofessional. -In an attempt to e-mail Yvonne (manager) one week prior to the trip to book a tour for the Bioluminenscent Bay, we recieved no answer. On Day 1 of our trip we went to the tour guide desk to book the tour ourselves. She called one tour company who was booked and potentially had 4 spots available we would just have to wait for a phone call later in the evening to confirm that those spots opened up. This tour desk attendent never called us back. The following morning, all of the spots were booked. -Upon adressing these issues with the manager (Victor) he assured us he booked us a private tour for us (2 guests) the following day for the Bio Bay. We waited in the lobby for over an hour for our tour guide to arrive! We had the front desk call our tour guide and he was completely unaware that he was giving us a tour because the hotel had never confirmed the tour. It also turned out that he was just our driver-and as per the hotel's request he, the driver, was to \"keep quiet\" about the fact that they never really booked us a tour and that upon arriving to the Bio Bay after an hour drive he was to ask around to see if their were any spots available. If there weren't, we had just wasted a 2 1/2 hour trip in the car for nothing and would have to return the hotel experience-less. On our trip to the Bio Bay I called Victor to ask him if we indeed had a tour book. He played dumb, and when I told him that our driver told us that we did not have a tour he stated \"why did he tell you that, he wasn't suppsed to.\" We ended up having to wait another 2 hours for a 8:30pm tour when originally we were supposed to have gotten a 5:30 tour (although the staff and managers LIED about ever booking a tour). We were forced to have yet another rushed 30 minute dinner by the bio bay. -Rooms are outdated and NOT clean. -Never once was approached by hotel staff by the pool or beach for a drink or something to eat -Pool side food is overpriced and lackluster in quality. Although my comments are harsh, they are 100%true and I wish my trip and stay here upon no one, not even my worst enemy. The managers lied repeatedly to our face and refused to accomodate us or acknowledge how wrong they were in every aspect of our treatment. I hope that this will steer some of you away from staying here and may save some of you a lot of money and anger in the future.", "Date": "March 28, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "2", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "College Park, Georgia", "Title": "\u201cMold, Mildew, and Mismanagement--probably the worst Hilton in the US.\u201d", "Author": "TravelBeard", "ReviewID": "UR126803821", "Content": "If there is a worse hotel for the money in this hemisphere, I am not aware of it. Sadly, it would appear from my recent stay that all the negative reviews here on TripAdvisor are accurate. After I booked a junior suite at this hotel, I read the reviews, and to allay my concerns, I contacted Susan Wilkerson who is noted in a few of these comments. (For the record, I think it is odd that you have to petition a luxury hotel ahead of time to ensure you will have a satisfactory experience--but if that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s what it takes.. . .) To her credit, she sent back an e-mail a few days before my arrival, assuring me she\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d look after me--and told me she\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d get back to me on a few of my questions posed in my note. Not sure she ever followed up with anyone else at the hotel--my question didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t get answered, and goodness knows, my stay didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t go well. Several of these reviews mention that the lobby on weekends becomes quite a hot spot. Depending upon your viewpoint, this is either great or awful. In my case, it was so loud when I checked in, I had to shout so the front desk agent (once I found her--no one was apparent behind the front desk when I arrived) could hear me. The check-in was not great. I guess I might have anticipated a better welcome since I am a HHonors Gold member. Had to ask the agent about breakfast arrangements and internet--which are key elements of the benefits a Gold member receives. Made my way to room 827, and was surprised to find that the junior suite I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d reserved wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t what I saw when I opened the door. 827 was a standard guest room, not a suite. So I called down to the front desk, and the phone rang and rang. Second try, I finally reached the agent who\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d checked me in. Explained to her that I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d reserved a junior suite, and this did not appear to be a junior suite. Her response was that I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d actually been \u00e2\u20ac\u0153upgraded\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd--that this was a grande vista room and was better than the junior suite I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d reserved. How a room that is 250 square feet smaller and goes for a lower rate constitutes an upgrade is beyond me, incidentally. When I pressed further, the agent told me that the junior suite wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t very nice anyway, as it overlooked air conditioning units, and not much else. This room did have a partial ocean view, for sure, but there isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t even a walk out balcony. . .just a Juliet ledge. Finally, the agent told me that there wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t anything she could do anyway, since they were full. As I was at the hotel for two nights, I had no desire to move rooms the next day, only to check out the day after. So much for my contacting Susan Wilkerson beforehand to ensure my stay would go smoothly. Even had I reserved this category of room, the poor housekeeping and deferred maintenance issues in 827 underscore how distant from a luxury hotel today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s El San Juan has become. The decor indicates a recent renovation, but the condition of the room reflects neglect and insufficient housekeeping. The shower glass was dirty, the shower ceiling was speckled with black mold, and the toilet had brown stains that indicated it was not cleaned properly. The walls of the bedroom are marred, the metal legs of the desk were rusty, there were stains on the desk and on the floor. The hotel compendium had no hotel information in it, but rather was just a baffling collection of advertisements. The stationery is left over from when this hotel attempted to be a Waldorf-Astoria. (That would have Mr. Astor twirling in his grave, this hotel in its current state.) On the positive side, the bed is very comfortable and the shower pressure is good. Few rooms in this hotel, despite the beachside setting, have views of the ocean--and this one did. (If you require great ocean views to go along with high room rates, this is not the resort for you--there are no rooms above the 9th floor, and given the trees, etc., rooms below floor 7 likely have little water view). A continental breakfast is a key benefit of being an HHonors Gold member, and La Terraza is the indoor/outdoor buffet restaurant for guests. I went down for breakfast and was told that owing to groups, no tables were available outside and there would be a 20 minute wait. So I left, and walked around the outside of the restaurant, where there were 7 tables available. . .I went back into the restaurant, and asked to be seated outside given the number of tables that were there empty. Given that individual guests only have one choice for breakfast--it is doubtful that accommodating a group of 20 for breakfast at the only restaurant is a great strategy. It certainly isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t guest-friendly. The buffet is standard Hilton breakfast--$25 per person, and $10 as an upgrade from the continental certificate Gold members receive. While capable, the breakfast could be anywhere. . .little if anything marked it as uniquely Puerto Rican. If I wanted to eat breakfast inside, I would have stayed up north. But given Saturday morning\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s fiasco, it will likely not surprise to learn that on Sunday morning, was told, yet again, that I couldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t sit outside, because there was a group. My reaction was less stoic than the previous day\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s. . .and I stood my ground and told the hostess that I planned to get a table outside to enjoy my breakfast. The manager overheard, stepped in, found me a cup of coffee, and ultimately, I got seated outside. Such hassles, two days in a row, are uncalled for in a hotel where the going rate is nearly $400 a night and breakfast is $25 a person. The mismanagement obvious in the rooms area extends to food and beverage as well. The pool area is gorgeous, though the hotel needs to institute measures to enable all guests to have access to pool and beach chairs. While it is not unique to this hotel that guests feel the need to save large blocks of chairs first thing in the morning--El San Juan should institute a 45 minute saved time limit as some other resorts have in place. While the pool deck is large and lush, there appears to be few staff dedicated to serving guests. It should be noted that such poor service and worse upkeep doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t come cheap. My guest room retailed for $390 a night (I used HHonors points) and to add insult to injury, there is a 14% \u00e2\u20ac\u0153resort charge\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd added to hotel bills. What does this include? Access to the fitness center, daily lounge entertainment, and daily pool activities. Yes, a $55 additional charge per day doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t even include internet access. Ouch. El San Juan has a few great attributes--the hotel is just 10 minutes from the airport, and it stands on 14 acres of the best beach in San Juan. Otherwise the location is out of the way for Condado or Old San Juan, a $15 or $20 cab ride respectively each way. (The public bus is just 75 cents, but if you choose to take the bus, prepare to wait as the schedules are erratic). All in all, I can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t recommend a hotel that so lacks an attention to hospitality details, and charges you exorbitantly for such mediocrity. In fairness, the manager on duty and I discussed all these issues, and the hotel has invited me back for a return stay. Still, a hotel should get things right from the beginning, rather than have to make up for gross inadequacies. There have to be better places, for less money, in San Juan. As if all of this weren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t enough, management at the hotel agreed to furnish a two-night stay as a result of the shortcomings I have outlined here. Remarkably, it took me a month and a half to receive the certificate from the hotel, only after I followed up with the hotel\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s executive office--and even so, it took the hotel a whole week to answer my subsequent e-mail. The experience was bad, and the recovery attempt was tepid and slow--only serving to depress my already low opinion of this terribly managed, poorly maintained hotel.

The beds and pillows were very comfortable. We had a patio, but no view, we didn't pay for one so I didn't expect it. We arrived very early and the room wasn't ready, but the hotel held our luggage and we hit the pool/beach(most hotels have a 3 PM check in) . The Hotel lobby is large and has 3 bars, a lot going on on the weekends, starting Friday night. Very Lively! The Disco \"Brava\" is the place to be if you like to dance and have a good time. You can hear the thumping of the base in your rooms if you are on the lower floors, but I had the TV on and was so tired from my daily activiites it didn't really bother me. The restaurants are pricey, but very good. The pool is clean and enough room for eveyone,but you need to get your pool beach chairs early or you'll wind up at the beach. Not such a bad thing since it's a tropical Island! The swim up bar and beach bar drinks adverage about $10-$12, but that's what they cost in NY anyway. The local beer(Medalla) is 8 in a bucket for $32) Took a cab ride to Old San Juan twice, visited the Fort, walked around and visited many shops and had dinner at 2 great restaurants, Al Dente (Italian) and the Dragonfly(Latin Asian). The cab drivers were very polite and a shout out to Hery the concerige who calls the cabs. A really nice guy. There is a grocery store down the block called \"Pueblo\" and a Walgreens a few blocks away if you need drinks or snacks for the room. There is a Chili's accross the street and 3 nice local places called Lupis(mexican/Latin) Don Juan(Latin/American) and Piu Bella(lunch, breakfast, great Gelato!) Also a Wendy's, Subway and a Chruch's Fried Chicken a few blocks away if you something cheaper to eat.

Having read the negative reviews about the refurbished rooms, we requested Lanai rooms. Ons the first trip we got a garden lanai on the second floor overlooking the pool, and on the return visit we specifically requested a casita as they are ground floor and lead directly onto the pool area. It was obvious that the very pleasant girl at the check in desk did not want to give us a casita - I am a Hilton Honors Gold member and she whispered to me: 'but that's a downgrade!'. Both rooms were tired and could do with re-decorating - particularly the casita -but the beds were comfy, the showers were great, the TV was flat screen and the aircon was powerful. We were perfectly happy with our choice. You may want to know that there are no safes or fridges in the casitas. The pool areas are fabulous with the most comfortable, deeply padded sun loungers I have ever come across. You can help yourself to free chilled water at the pool which is a nice touch. The formal restaurants are very expensive, but as mentioned in a previous review do go to the happy hours at the Palms restaurant between 5 and 7pm where small plates are served at the bar for the bargain price of $5.50 each. Just two of these would make a generous dinner for most people. There is a reasonably priced Pizza restaurant in the hotel and if all else fails, there is a selection of more moderately priced outlets within easy walking distance of the hotel, including a Chilli's directly opposite. The casino has a good selection of slots and table games and together with the lobby bars made for a great night out which is obviously popular with more than just residents. One slight negative was that we didn't realise until our last night that drinks were complimentary in the casino - the waitresses were that difficult to spot!

To begin, we had basically perfect weather. Maybe a drizzle and a few hours of clouds over 8 days. Overall, we had a great time. Positives: -The hotel is literally 4 minutes from the airport and if you are coming from a U.S. city, there is obviously no immigration. So, land, get your bags, get in a cab and you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re in the hotel in no time. -Check in was excellent- very efficient. No lines and had our rooms ready in 1 hour, despite the fact we arrived well before official check-in. Everybody speaks English, but they also enjoy speaking Spanish w/ Americans who like to. -While hotel has been around for a while, it is still very nice. Lobby area is great (especially at night) w/ great pools and easy walking to the beach. The beach and water are pretty nice, but not as nice as some other Caribbean destinations. There was a lot of seaweed in the water and it often would end up on the edge of the beach. -The beach attendants are very helpful in getting lounge chairs set up. We gave a tip each time. -The Rooms are fine. Good size and beds are comfortable. Bathrooms are not anything special. They\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re small and showers are small and have not been renovated in a while. -Service was overall excellent. Room cleaning excellent. Great that you can get food/drink service on the beach and at the pool. Food at the pool/beach is reasonably priced, but drinks are expensive. -Lots of water activities available for extra charge right on the beach (jet ski, banana boats, parasailing, etc.) -There are a few places in walking distance from the hotel to check out. For lunch, dinner and ice cream/dessert. The Metropol restaurant a block away (towards the East) was good and reasonable. Also, an excellent find was a Pizza place (I think called Pizza city)- about \u00c2\u00bd mile walk on Isla Verde Blvd west of the hotel. Best NY pizza I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve had outside of NY. Go buy a pie or 2 and bring it back to the hotel for lunch. -There are a number of WalGreens and SuperMarkets very close by. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d suggest buying various snacks, drinks and chips to bring onto the beach/pool during the day. -Old San Juan and Condado beach area are just a cab away and have good restaurants. Negatives: -As noted, the rooms and especially the bathrooms are just OK. -Restaurants in the hotel are very good, but expensive, as are drinks at the pool and hotel. Breakfast buffet is not worth it. Get something at Starbucks or even outside at one of the places on Isla Verde Blvd. -While we and our kids had a great time, there isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t any organized activities for kids. No beach or pool soccer, volleyball, etc. -The gym is OK. -Also, as noted, the beach is fine, but nothing special compared to much of the Caribbean. -When leaving at the airport you need to go through an Agriculture check of your bags. The lines can be extremely long for this, the bag check in and security, especially on days that Cruise Ships are ending their weeks in San Juan. Be prepared for long lines and ask for a porter to expedite things (and should tip them). -Rainforest tour. We booked and paid for a \u00c2\u00bd day rainforest tour through the hotel/trip people at the hotel. It was fairly expense, it was a fairly long/bumpy drive and we only stopped at 3 spots. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d recommend renting your own car, get directions and do the trip on your own.

We had a fantastic stay there! When we booked our trip, we had carefully read the reviews and were not sure what to believe, so we contacted Susan Wilkerson to explain that I was recovering from spinal surgery and needed to be in a room that was away from the noise. Susan was fantastic throughout our trip, going above and beyond to ensure that we were comfortable and that our needs were met!! She even had a cheese platter and drinks sent tour room, but she went out of her way to be helpful, beyond that, even when we had assured her that everything was perfect! Kudos, Susan! While were there, my husband and I were reading some of the reviews and virtually pulling our hair out about them! Our reaction was: \"Huh? Is this a competitor hotel writing?\" Our room was perfect! It was pretty, large, clean (always!) and quiet, and it had a balcony/patio area (we were on third floor of the main tower), with a partial ocean view. The beds were really comfortable and I loved the ceiling fan, which along with the ample air-conditioning (a rarity in my experinece!), lulled me to sleep whenever I sank into bed. Our bathroom wasn't tiny as some others have experienced, it was fine, and there was always hot water. In terms of the maid service, I'd have to say that WE were the rude ones, b/c we frequently did not leave the room until after 4:00 PM; but, when we would see a maid in the hallway to then ask for towels, etc., they'd insist that they'd happily clean the room for us. This happened several times. Everyone has already remarked on the beauty of the grounds and pools/beach and I echo that sentiment. The pools were crystal clean, the beach was beautiful (and, by the way, it's public, so I was impressed by how clean it was for a public beach!), and the pool boys and servers were very helpful and friendly. How can people say that everything is overpriced at this hotel? The swim-up pool menu prices were: $13 for a burger, $11 for sandwiches, etc. We've stayed at resorts all around the Carribean and in Europe and we've never seen prices this low! Granted, drinks are expensive, but they are always expensive at resorts and you can buy liquor outside the hotel and drink on the beach, so that's an advantage in my mind to what I've been able to do on other resort vacations that were not all inclusive. I am really surprised that there are comments that are no other places to go except for the resort. This is simply not true. There are a myriad of options just next door to the hotel! For fine dining, check out the Intercontinetal next door if you are not happy with the many fine restaurants in the hotel (this is just one example); if you want to pass on the breakfast buffet, you can find extremely inexpensive options across the street from the hotel, next door to the hotel, etc.! There are a variety of restaurants on the strip just outside the hotel, so check them out! There is also a Walgreen's next door to the hotel -- a tremendous convenience. Now, I found these places with a spinal cord injury, so I'm sure you can find them if you just leave the resort! We also loved the verve of the hotel. We are in our 50's, so the club scene was not for us, but the lobby was magical at night, with salsa dancing and other types of music....electrifying even if you are just passing through. I can honestly say that we did not have a single problem during our stay, enjoying every moment of it! Everything was perfect! I would highly recommend the El San Juan and I'm not young :), so that's a high recommendation!! Thanks for everything, Susan!

I generally had an enjoyable time here. Negatives: You are trapped here and at the mercy of the hotel's prices. There are very few good restaurants around the hotel or places to have a drink. Of course, it is a resort so resort prices are to be expected. But El San Juan takes it to the next level. We ate breakfast here both days and opted for the cheaper continental breakfast. The problem? If you grab a larger plate from the hot buffet immediately next to the continental breakfast (rather the saucer - I am not exaggerating - that they provide for the continental breakfast), you have opted for the more expensive buffet. Also, items from the more expensive buffet are intermixed with the continental buffet, and you must rely on the hostess to explain to you what those items are, or - you guessed it - you have elected to pay for the more expensive buffet. This is an ongoing problem, as we were warned from wiser guests ... but we still were tripped up. The manager, Diana, refused to take off the charge. Instead, she was immediately hostile and implied that we had intended to conceal our \"theft.\" In the end, it isn't about the upcharge, but the generally feeling that the hotel is trying to drain as much money out of you in as many different ways as possible. Another issue - the rooms are not the cleanest. Surfaces had dust and dirt in the corners. The vinyl shower curtain had mildew on it. My suggestion - stay in Condado where the hotels have to compete with the other fine dining available in the area.", "Date": "March 17, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "2", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Sleep Quality": "2", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Utica, New York, USA", "Title": "\u201cNot worth the money!\u201d", "Author": "Shannon K", "ReviewID": "UR126237341", "Content": "This was our first trip to Puerto Rico and this resort came highly recommended from a friend of a friend.

It was not cheap to stay here and for what we payed the room should have been nicer, none of the rooms in the main building have balconies, which when we booked i was reassured several times that our room would have a balcony, well none of them do, so that was dissapointing. Also, although they claim the rooms have been recently remodeled, at a closer look they are dirty and in need of some care, I actually wore my flip flops in the shower i was so disguted by it. The walls are paper thin and i am not exagerating at all! We heard the couple in the room next to us arrive back at there room at 4am and we got to listen to them have sex, then at 8 in the moring we heard nose blowing, throat clearing and coughing, and we could also here every word they said to eachother, it was like they were in out room! Also, the fitness center was right above us so the treadmills woke us up at 6:30 every moring! We complained twice with no results. The first time i complained about the lack of balcony, when i as assured before i booked it that our room would have a balcony, I told them i wanted an Ocean Lanai room, they are seperate from the main building and actually do have balconies, but i was told that they were all full but they would contact us when someone checked out. Nobody ever contacted us. I also infomed them about the nasty bathroom, they sent housekeeping up but they really needed to sent up a contractor to remodel that tiny nasty bathroom! What a dissapointment. Also, the food and drinks were very expensive on the resort, $7 for a bottle of water, $25 per person for continental breakfast, what a joke! $60 for lunch at the pool, $25 for two drinks, unacceptable! The pizza place was awesome and reasonably priced! we walked to many different reasaurants off of the resort for breakfast and dinner everyday and the food was outstanding and affordable! We also found a man on the beach making hot dogs and hamburgers and kabobs, which were great!

The walls are very thin and noise is an issue. AVOID anything over (or even 4 floors up) from the nightclub in the Hotel. We made that mistake once, and heard the bass until the club closed at 4am :( Not bad if you're AT the club until 4, but that night, we went to bed early...or tried to! If you want to sit in the pool cabanas, it's easy to get one. If you want the more coveted \"swim deck\" by swim up bar, get there early! It's a bit more of a party and social scene, which we found fun! No umbrellas for shade in this area. Wouldn't recommend sitting there with kids, toddlers...you'll just make those who want to drink, be loud, and have fun all day...annoyed. There's better, shady, shallow pool areas for kids anyway :) If you prefer the beach, access is easy, chairs are available (first come first served), and you can usually flag down a server for drinks! Again, I haven't found another Hotel with these amenities. Restaurants are good. There's a starbucks and shopping too. Lobby has bands some nights, and people gather, dance, and drink at the main bar.

My review may be a little long, but I wanted to break it down for those who are thinking of staying there and also give a few helpful tips. Check-in: Arrived at hotel at @ 1pm, our room wasn't ready, check-in is officially at 4 but we were lucky to get into our room at 3pm. I had emailed Susan Wilkerson (front desk mgr) a few times prior to arrival to see about removing down bedding (I'm allergic), a fridge for meds and to request a room higher up away from the noise. Susan was very accomodating with these requests and put us in room 825, which had a side ocean view. Pool bars: While waiting for our room, we went outside to the pool area and ordered a light beer and a rum drink. The cost was $20!!! The rum drink was in a small disposable cup, maybe 7 oz and the beer was a small 10 oz can. From what I heard from friends who have stayed in the area, that is the norm for the bigger hotels to charge that much. I also noticed they had special food stations w/mini kebobs etc but no prices on anything. Even some of the bar menus didn't have pricing on them, which brings me to my next point below, EVERYTHING gets charged to the room, they will not let you pay cash or credit, it all gets billed to your room. I do not like this practice and not all hotels in the area do this. Restaurants in hotel: We didn't eat in any of them, though they looked good. See my seperate reviews for Platos Resturant, BLT at the Ritz Carlton, La Playita, Ciao etc... Casino: Being we are not big gamblers we went to the casino once, it was very nice and crowded. I played the slot machine once. Lobby: It's a gorgeous lobby with bars, lounges, a nightclub (Brava), on Friday and Saturday nights, it was jumping with entertainment. It's definitely a hotspot for dancing and music. Pool area: Be ready to get up early and duke it out for chairs, they are usually gone by 7am. You have to get your towels from the towel stand or towel guys walking around and stake your claim. If you do not return the towels you will be charged $20. The pool has a few hot tubs which were very nice and cabana huts to rent (not sure the cost for rental). The pool area in general is very pretty with palm trees and other tropical foliage. Listening to the coquis at night was cool. Beach: There are young men wearing aqua/turquoise colored shirts who work for the hotel they will get you beach chairs and set them up for you for free (we would give them a tip) but if you want an umbrella, it will cost you $10. There was never a problem getting beach chairs. The weather was mid to high 80's and the beach area was very nice. The first day there was tons of seaweed in the water but by the 2nd day it was starting to subside. We spent most of our days at the beach, only spent one day at the pool. There a people on the beach who sell hotdogs for like $2, frozen coconuts $5, sodas and water for $1 and further up the beach past the Intercontinental hotel there was a woman who sold delicious empanadas on the beach for $2. There are also a few stands on the beach w/people selling jewelry, hats, souvenirs etc.. I bought a few jewelry items from Iris' stand, she was nice and her prices pretty reasonable, but please note there is no price haggling here. Tower Rooms: Our room was very nice, a good size and had a sitting area, there are no balconies in the tower rooms but you can open the door to look out. The room was super clean and the maid was great, sometimes coming in 2 times a day to give us more towels and to freshen up the room. The bathroom could've used more shelves to put your stuff, some re-grouting on the tile floor in shower, hotter water (I love HOT showers even in the summer, but it was only hot when you 1st jumped in, then would turn lukewarm) and the way the shower was configured, you had to stand in it in order to turn the water on. We heard none of the noise from the lobby in our room, but we had a room that had an adjoining door and the walls were a little thin, lucky for us our neighbors were pretty quiet, but at times could hear them playing music and watching tv. Casita or Garden Lanai rooms: These rooms are seperate from tower, the Lanais were 2 floors and caistas were 1 level. They were close to pool area, I looked at one that a maid was cleaning, they looked nice but I would imagine you would hear all the lobby noise and the pool areas have music and sometimes a DJ outside. The Galleria: It's a small shopping center adjacent to hotel, has a Starbucks, clothing boutiques, pizza, Japanese restaurant etc... Prices a little high but again that seems to be the norm for the area. Hotel Staff: Everyone was very friendly and helpful, from Susan Wilkerson, the doormen, security, the maid, the beach/pool area guys, and Ramon at the towel stand who I had nice morning chats with. Resort fees: I know most hotels charge this fee nowadays but with the amount of money you are spending to stay there, I think it's a little ridiculous. Some helpful hints: I packed a small lunch tote type cooler in my suitcase. Went to Walgreens that is a block or 2 away, puchased 12 pk of beer, wine, bottles of water and ice teas for only 25 dollars ( a whole lot cheaper than buying that stuff at the hotel). We would fill up the cooler with ice and take our beverages to the beach with us every morning. I had also packed in my carry on bag granola bars, breakfast bars, trail mixes to munch on. There's is also a supermarket called Pueblo that is across the street and behind the building that Chili's is in that had a very nice, large selection of wine and beer. It's also a good idea to pack some warm weather clothes in your carry-on bag this way if your room is not ready, you can change your clothes and go enjoy the the beautiful pool area and beach.", "Date": "March 5, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "New Haven, Connecticut", "Title": "\u201cNot Great, but Good Enough!\u201d", "Author": "Don M", "ReviewID": "UR125656942", "Content": "I read a ton of reviews for this hotel before booking our trip, but decided to give it a shot despite many negative reviews.

We agree that the customer service was not spectacular, but it wasn't horrible either. Besides, we weren't expecting 5 star service at a 4 star hotel. For that matter, people should go to the Ritz right up the street. So, don't expect the staff to serve you like a king, but just know that you're on an island - where everyone is laid back as can be. And so it doesn't pay to act like a snob or be demanding. The food at Platos (few blocks up) was simply amazing. Metropol was just OK, and the Italian Cafe inside the hotel was really good.

I confirmed that we had a view of the pool and gardens on a high floor (my husband emailed with Susan Wilkerson prior to our arrival). We went to the lobby bathroom and changed (had I known about the Spa facilities on 10 we would have changed up there). Our room was ready at 2:30 pm, however it was not the view we had booked and then confirmed. We were on the 6th floor with a view of a disgusting roof of air-conditioning systems. I hadn't even brought our bags up, so I went down and complained immediately. Suffice it to say it took several emails, a credit, a cheese and fruit platter and 2 nights (3 days) before our room moved. They definitely do not pre-assign rooms no matter what they tell you, I watched families with 4 people being given King bed rooms. There has to be a better way. The room itself was reasonably clean, but definitely run down. Drapes were torn, paint was peeling in the bathroom. The grounds on the other hand were phenomenal. The pools and seating areas were well maintained. We had the same experience \"reserving\" the sunning beds on the back pool wall. I tipped, then was told that the hotel was too crowded, so I bolted down at 5:45 am. Again, there has to be a better way. The beach was nothing too exciting, it was very crowded, the seaweed was smelly. We sat on the beach for brief periods, but liked walking down the beach where things were less crowded and less full of seaweed. The lobby is unbelievable, and there is always action. We ate the buffet breakfast at the hotel which was always stocked and no lines, food was great. We also ate light breakfast from the Starbucks. The food at the pizza place was surprisingly good (pizza, burger, local food and gelato), but be prepared for a bit of a wait. Japanese was fresh and good, the Palm was eh - wouldn't recommend it at all. Things not to miss - the night kayaking in the bioluminescent bay, it is work, but worth it; the rain forest trip that includes swimming in the falls (bring a rain poncho and towels and wear sneakers); El Murro is amazing; Old San Juan - our best 2 meals were at El Jibarito and Mojitos. If we had more time we would have gone to Marmalade or Aguaviva. Pikayo at the Conrad Hilton was incredible. We went to the Bacardi factory because we wanted to get out of the sun for a few hours before meeting friends in Old San Juan. The set-up is beautiful, but don't expect to learn much.

We brought our kids over to this hotel around 12 noon and sat out by the pool (FYI they need to invest in more umbrellas for the pool...there were 2...yes 2 at the main pool which sucked for everyone else who had to bake). My husband went in to check at 4 and was told we have no idea when your room will be ready. I was very annoyed since I had emailed Susan Wilkerson prior to arrival to let her know our situation. I went to the front desk and asked for Susan and she came out and promptly gave us a garden lanai room. The room was quite large (room 366) had cathedral ceilings and a walk in closet. The bathroom needed to be updated but was clean. Traveling with our two kids it was fine. The balcony was nice for us to sit in the evenings but could have used a power washing. Susan also sent us a lovely cheese plate and chocolate chip cookie tray for our boys complimentary the following night. It was a lovely surprise. The pizza place at the hotel was quite good and we had a night in ordered a large pie for about $15. We bought wine at a local store within walking distance. It was a very pleasant experience. The staff was very nice. Laury at the pool was super nice and went out of her way to make us happy. The beach was covered in seaweed and they should've had that raked. I did ask one of the beach staff and they said a public truck was supposed to come by and they didn't. For what customers pay to stay here...they should have a clean beach. We did eat at the Palm steakhouse one night and it was TERRIBLE. I will review that separately.

I might be biased about this hotel because it was during that trip that I met my husband. My husband and I traveled to the El San Juan during Presidents Week as a second honeymoon. We read some negative reviews about the place, which was very surprising to me because my experience at the hotel 5 years ago was so pleasant. I am glad we ignored the reviews and opted to book our trip because we had an amazing trip and it was worth every penny that we spent. Because it was Presidents Week, the hotel was very crowded, but that did not have any impact on our vacation and we had a great time regardless. However, this week is the busiest week to travel and any major hotel or resort would be filled to capacity. If you are not willing to deal with crowds that it might be best that you chose another week to travel. Our room was beautiful and spotless and we had a great view of the pool and the ocean. We were on the seventh floor. I slept comfortably and I thought the bed was very comfortable. Sue Wilkerson, the hotel manager, sent us a lovely platter of cheese, wine, and champagne to congratulate us on our new marriage. It really made us feel special and we are grateful to her for her generosity. It was not difficult to get a chair at the pool, but we are early risers and were at the pool by 9 am. For others, there was some trouble. People reserved chairs and did not return to use them until later in the day or not at all. It might be helpful if the hotel staff was more cognizant of this and maybe cleared off chairs that were not in use after a few hours. Although I think the chair shortage is an issue at any hotel during this week, it is not fair to the guests who paid a lot of money to stay at the hotel and there should be better rules in place. The restaurants were VERY expensive and so were the drinks. We shopped at the Walgreens up the road to alleviate some of the cost. We ate at Koko one night and the food was spectacular and the service was amazing. We also at ate the sushi place, which was way over priced and the food was mediocre. Thankfully, there is a Starbucks in the hotel and we got coffee and a light breakfast there every day, except the first day. The lobby bar is so much fun and the entertainment is great! We returned to the hotel for the nightlife every night. It is the place to be.

Beautiful lobby, staff was pleasant. The bathrooms in the lobby and out by the pool were gross. Room was in desperate need of a make over. The bathroom had cracked tile and mold on the ceiling and in the vent. The bedding was ok but the bed was very uncomfortable. Too soft and I could feel the springs. We had a balcony and the slidding door kept falling off the track. Also you will hear planes taking off all day the airport is very close. I've stayed at the Intercontinental(next door to ESJ) and never noticed it as much as I did at the ESJ. If you go during Presidents day week beware hotel is at max capacity. If you want a chair at the pool get there early to get the best spot. I saw people out there at 5am(or earlier) saving their chairs. And what killed me was people would save a row of chairs in the sun and also in the shade but then take off for the beach. They would never return to those saved chairs but would leave towels and shoes or magazines on them. Making them completely unavailable for anyone to ever have those seats. Also if you like to have a drink by the pool be prepared to pay. $8 coronas and $11 pina coloda????? Not sure which is crazier the fact the hotel charges that much or that I actually paid it. I know the answer to that one. In either direction of the hotel there is a Walgreens. Go there and get your alcohol and save yourself some money. If you have the time catch a cab to Miramar and check out the restuarant Casita Miramar. It was a great place to eat and their sangria is really good. And there is a Fro-yo World(frozen yogurt) about a block away from there which is yummy as well. The hotel offers The Palm restuarant which is good but pricey. There is also a restuarant in the lobby that has pizza, gelato, salds etc... which was pretty good. The Verdanza hotel which is on Tartak(5min walk) has a restaurant called 8020 and we've had breakfast and lunch there a few times. It was good also. There is also a bakery ( I cant remember the name)about a 5min walk and they serve breakfast, lunch and dinner(I think). We had breakfast there and it was good. Their Lattes are were very good.

My wife wanted to do something special and Presidents Day weekend was clear in her calendar. It didn't hurt that it was fairly adjacent to Valentines Day. I read all the TripAdvisor reviews and went to the El San Juan with substantial fears about doing so based on the other submissions. I left very pleased-- we had a wonderful time. For those of you who are also concerned, I'll provide tips and address some of the concerns of other reviewers, so forgive the long entry. Hopefully you'll mark this helpful. The location is in Isle Verde, fairly close to the airport. It's not in Old San Juan (which is where we preferred to stay), but we were using HH points so we took it. Old San Juan is only 15 mins away by car, so it was fine. Our location afforded us some space away from the city, and a very lovely beach location. If we go back, we may try the Caribe-- but I have no hesitation to recommend the El San Juan to you or any of my friends. The room. There are some garden villas, as well as rooms in the main hotel. I understand that there is a \"new section\" to the hotel which has some renovations going on. We stayed in Room 621 and the room was very nice. The decor was colorful and inviting. The view stank as it looked over a parking lot, but we spent zero time in the room staring out the window anyway. (Views can be over rated unless you plan to just sit on a balcony the whole time.) I'll attach a picture below. It was great. Lots of reviewers talk about crappy bathrooms. To the hotel staff: I'll say that a good steam cleaning of the grout and a re-caulking of the tile would be a useful investment. But by no means was it a problem. The room was clean and the bathroom was just fine. Lots of reviewers complain about the elevators. There are three. One was out much of a busy weekend. Yet, we never waited more than 2-3 minutes to get an elevator. Much ado about nothing, I say. Hotel: Get the elevator to be reliable. Noise. There was none on the 6th floor. Lots of reviewers complain about this, yet it wasn't our experience in the least. The hotel is BUSY because it's a great place to stay. There is free Salsa music in the lobby on Friday night. There was more free live music on Saturday night (and a long DJ set featuring disco music for us 50-somethings). And on Sunday night, there was live Jazz. There are two bars in this area that serve affordable food, so this is the indoor hub of the hotel. Of course it will be busy and noisy-- it's a huge value. Hotel staff: Bravo! The pool area. When we first arrived, our room was not ready. (This happens when you check in at 2pm and the official check in time is 4pm. Suck it up.) They took our bags and we proceeded to tour the pool area and look for food. John, the pool area manager, saw us looking lost and gave us a nice tour of the grounds. Very kind of him. He tool us to the far bar/pool area (I think it's called El Canto or something) and we ordered lunch, due to his recommendation of the salads. The salad was great, but the cocktail wasn't. Apparently, when the bars run out of the nice tall 14-16 oz plastic glasses, they use the disposable 7oz cups. At $12, this is BAD practice. I was mad about it all weekend. Yet every other drink I had was the normal price, in a big glass, and was excellent. See Eric at the front bar for an exceptional pina colada. HOTEL: Buy more glassware. NEVER serve your customers in those crappy disposable cups. You owe us two drinks. The beach. Fantastic. Free lounges provided by the hotel. Local vendors doing their thing. It was pleasant and bug free. The view was great, the water was warm. God: Bravo! (Hotel staff-- you get no credit for this one. But thanks for the chairs.) The casino. It's small. But that's not why we went there. We did win $60 though. The service. The guy who checked us in at the front desk was EXCELLENT. Thank you, Carlos. Other than the people I named here in my review, the service was good but not great. The lobby bar needs more servers (HOTEL: the servers work on tips, right? so increase your labor slightly-- you're leaving money on the table). The restaurants on site are great, but expensive. The service there needs polish too. All in all-- a great getaway weekend. It was our first time in Puerto Rico and we'll be back. Next time, I'll lay around the El San Juan all day and enjoy the pool more. We were able to get in a tour of El Morro and the Bacardi plant, so that took much of our weekend.

Their staff is exceptional, including Carlos, who checked me in and Maria, who handled the keeping of my room. Both were attentive and caring to any needs. Take Carlos. Upon checking in, I told him that I had read some concerning reviews about what it was like to have a room close to the infamous Brava, the nightclub at El San Juan. I told him that 30 years ago, I would haven been partying at the Brava, but that I was 60 now and was looking forward to a peaceful and relaxing time at the El San Juan. Bless his heart, Carlos found a room for me on the eighth floor. He\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the best. Although even on the eighth floor I could still hear the base beat from Brava, it wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t that much. (For those who are unaware, Brava is the happening nightclub at El San Juan that appeals not only to guests, but to many locals in San Juan. They\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re open Thursday, Friday and Saturday nights starting at 10:30 p.m. and are open all night long with the music cranked up.) My room was beautiful and very clean. The colors ranged in a compatible spectrum from cream to green, and the look was very sleek. The floors were tiled and had a striated surface to make them slip resistant. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s easy to see why this flooring works for the El San Juan since it is easy to track sand into the room from the beach, even with the beach showers. The bathroom was adequately sized, and very quaintly decorated with small hand laid tiles throughout. Hand laid tiles is a lost art since they take an exceptional amount of workmanship, time and patience, so it was very warming to have the experience of having a bathroom with such wonderful workmanship of a prior time. One tip is to keep the folder that your room key comes in because it has a map of the El San Juan property on the back. I could find no literature in the room about what El San Juan has to offer, so I used this map as my guide. Dining at El San Juan is wonderful, although I must admit that I only ate dinner at The Palm while I was there. The bartender during the week at The Palm is wonderful and makes a great margarita. The Palm also has a satisfying menu of happy hour \u00e2\u20ac\u0153bar bites\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd for $5.50 a plate, such as steak sliders, chicken parmesan sliders, and other offerings. The Palm also has a great Arugula salad that I ordered each night, and wonderful crab cakes. There are a lot of people at the bar during the week, which is a lot of fun. The pool bar (Aquaire) is also wonderful. Eric there makes a great margarita, and Aquaire also has a bar menu during the day. El San Juan has three higher-end restaurants (The Palm, which offers steak and seafood; La Piccola Fontana, which offers Italian food; and Koco, which is Japanese.) El San Juan also has a small, attached shopping area to the left of the entrance to the hotel called the Galleria. In the Galleria is Galeria Pizza and Trattoria, which offers more moderately priced breakfasts, lunches and dinners. The attached Galleria also has a convenience store and souvenir shop (Viaggi) that sells everything from clothing souvenirs, to sundries, small cups of Ben and Jerry\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s ice cream, to a small selection of wines and beers. You name it, and Viaggi has it. For breakfast El San Juan has La Terraza, which is a relaxing restaurant with both an enclosed dining area and a dining area in an open air terrace that overlooks the ocean and pool. I really enjoyed the experience of having breakfast on the outdoor terrace, looking out at the ocean and enjoying the wonderful ocean air. As others have noted, the full buffet is $25, but I decided it was worth it with the tropical feel. As with any outdoor restaurant, however, you get to share it with any birds or other wildlife wondering by that are interested in eating breakfast, too. They won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t come to your table unless you leave, so if you leave, be sure to put a napkin over your food and you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be fine. A chameleon may also cross your path at El San Juan as you are walking around the pool area. It all adds to the experience, and I found my leisurely breakfasts at La Terraza and the tropical wildlife around the resort area one of the best parts of my trip. For those who want a more moderately priced breakfast, there are two Starbucks at El San Juan, one to the left as you enter the hotel, and one in the Galleria area. The Starbucks in the lobby is open during the morning and offers breakfast sandwiches and oatmeal. The Starbucks in the Galeria is larger and open all day. The pool area and ocean are beautiful, and be sure to see the Banyan tree that is to the left as you enter the pool area. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s so incredible. The only final comment is that anyone who visits the El San Juan needs to remember that this hotel is a very happening place, both for visitors and locals alike. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a very popular place to see and be seen. As with any such place, noisy neighbors, people coming back from partying (and having had a very good time), are very much a part of the fabric of being at El San Juan. The fact the floors aren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t carpeted and there isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t sound proofing in the Brava or elsewhere (such as sound resistant wall fabrics or paint), means that there isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t anything to minimize the sounds of other vacationers and nightclub attendees who are having a wonderful time. I got used to it after my second night, but if you are looking for a quiet, peaceful, low-volume vacation, a quiet boutique hotel may be more suited to you.", "Date": "February 21, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "San Juan, Puerto Rico", "Title": "\u201cBeautiful lobby\u201d", "Author": "ChanelCinq", "ReviewID": "UR124983728", "Content": "I didn't stay here but we came to drink, dine, and gamble.

CONCERNS - When I contacted Susan about request for high floor, etc....my room was downgraded from my booked Junior Suite to a regular room. I noticed and then had to talk with corporate to get my original reserved room reinstated....which it was. According to Susan, this may be a HH website glitch being able to book the Suite. - The rooms and amenities definitely reflect why this was downgraded to a 4-star property. First impressions matter and upon entering our very big room, the first thing we noticed was the large crack in our room window. The rooms are very bare and basic - no in room coffee or tea, small bathroom with no tub, no balcony (although our window had a door you could open), and most criminal of all is 4 straight days of twice daily warm showers. We took showers at all hours of the days here and never had a hot shower. - Major elevator issues at this property. First of all, there are only 3. Secondly, they were never all working and one day all of them were out so everyone was climbing up a set of staff staircases to get around. Average wait if they were working was probably 3-4 minutes. - As others have said, noise is an issue here. Honestly, I don't know how to advise getting a room that would be quiet. Based on reviews here, I requested a high floor (to be away from the club) and away from the elevators. Unfortunately, the end of the hotel away from the club is near the entrance of the hotel where everyone stands outside to drink/ smoke/ arrive as well as near the airport. So, while we avoided the club noise, we listened to all that noise every night and had to sleep with earplugs which reduced most that noise. - Not a huge deal, but it was interesting there was no guide to hotel services/ amenities in the room. - We had false minibar charges on our final bill which were promptly removed without question at the front desk (just make sure you review). - Concierge wasn't particularly helpful with explaining how the local bus works (bring quarters, they require exact change!) and we got much better info and maps from the Intercontinental concierge next door. - While we appreciated the HH Continental Breakfast....upgrade to warm foods is $10 more (plus additional taxes)...and really the whole breakfast area and selection is fine and basic but not like you would have at a 5-star hilton property.......and unfortunately their outside seating area is like being in the movie The Birds - many, many (25++) black birds (grackles?) and pigeons congregate in the outdoor seating. They perch on chairs and tables (yes, even the \"clean\" tables and dishes you eventually eat off of) watching you eat, and if you get up, they all get all over your table, in your food, in your napkins, etc. I guess it is nature but just not very sanitary. SUMMARY The outdoor part of this property is awesome and the location very good. Inside, I would say it is an average 4-stoor property with the type of issues you would expect there. I feel it was a decent value for my points, but I would likely try elsewhere next time.", "Date": "February 17, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Stone Ridge, VA", "Title": "\u201cBachelor Party trip to the El San Juan\u201d", "Author": "sbouldin", "ReviewID": "UR124682915", "Content": "A total of 8 of us flew down for my brother's bachelor party. We had a great time at the hotel. We had 2 rooms, with 2 beds in each room. The beds were very comfortable and the room was big enough for 4 of us. As others have said, the bathrooms are a disappointment. Very small and a shower that needed a lot of TLC. I give the rooms a 4/5 just because of the bath issue. Checking in was a breeze. Mara was awesome and was very nice. We got in early, so she had us check our bags and we waited for the rooms out by the pool and grabbed some lunch. The lobby of the hotel is amazing; huge and spacious with dark mahogany wood throughout. There are 2 bars and plenty of places to sit down and relax. At night, it turns into one big party and his packed with dancing and mingling. Also off of the lobby is a nightclub where hotel guests can get in free. You'll need some nice close toed shoes to get in though. FYI, the drinks in the night club are quite a bit cheaper then those out in the lobby bars. The pool area is what sets this place apart. It's awesome. 2 huge pools, plenty of lounges and chairs, 3+ hot tubs, swim up bar. It's awesome. Plus, you have direct access to the beach where you can rent jet skis, pick up some food from local vendors, or just veg out. I\"ve seen some folks complain about the beach, but I thought it was fine. The seaweed can be a bit rough on the feet, but they can't help that. Lastly, the casino is a lot of fun. Don't expect Vegas, but it was clean and had a good vibe to it.

I have been staying at La Concha, bit wanted a bit of a change. Overall I did think this hotel was hopping!! The check in was easy, the bar scene with Live musical bands was awesome and the staff was great!! i Stayed in an island lanai, and not the main hotel. I was upset at first being away from the closed up action of the main building. However, I heard from many that the main hotel gets very noisy with many people over drinking at the bars. So as it turned out the Island Lanai, which has older rooms and a small bathroom was very quiet. It was also very convenient to get to the hotel an beach. As far as food goes, the morning buffet breakfasts which run about $30 after they add in sales taxes that I never heard of, was a bit pricey, but convenient. I ate there every day because that food was great and heck ....it was right there! The food that they have at pool, the burgers, rotis chicken, and salads where first class, but the morning buffet should keep you full most of the day. I absolutely loved the Japanese restaurant at the hotel!! They have a $20 sushi lunch that was great, so we went back and had dinner there as well. Sushi is always expensive so Id say it was the right price. Was very very disappointed in the Palm restaurant!! Its the forst time I ever walked out of a restaurant complaining....so much so that they didnt let me pay the check! The place was 1/2 full yet the waiter service was horrible. My date ordered the tuna and hated it, while i orderd sirloin steak and was brought filet mignon....this after waiting 40 minutes for my soup!! Very disappointed and i wouldnt go back to the Palms...even at the zero price tag....its over priced. The casino was great!! Lively, fun, seemed on the level ...but i won so maybe im being a little to generous with my love of the casino. The pools and lounge chairs were great!! Only problem is that people put 2 towels on two chairs at the beach, on the private lounges, and on two chairs at the main pool. They cover six chairs and use them as they see fit, son you will see many chairs with only towels saving the seats....That part was bad, but if you go to the pool area by 10 you will have a good selection of where to sit. Over all... I love this place! Its only 7 minutes to the airport and there are many restaurants and a walgreen in short walking distance. Everyone at the hotel was friendly and also there to say good morning and welcome. I will definately go back in six months.....Great place", "Date": "February 13, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Milwaukee, Wisconsin", "Title": "\u201cFebruary 2012\u201d", "Author": "Nicole G", "ReviewID": "UR124535894", "Content": "I was at the El San Juan Feb 2012, duration of the trip was just over a week. The room: we stayed in the Garden Villas. 2nd & 3rd floors had nice balconies that faced the main hotel and one of the pool areas. 1st floors faced the same direction, but had a large walk-out to the pool patio. The room was very quiet. Our room was a king room, and had a small couch/living room/office setup, a large walk-in closet, large double sink plus extra vanity, and a small, seperate room for the toilet and bathtub/shower (the tub and toilet room was SMALL, bathtub/shower is standard). Overall it was nice (except toilet & bathtub which were cramped and dated), but nothing out of the ordinary, with the exception of the balcony which was a very nice plus. We constantly had issues with our keycard not working. It was probably because we had it next to a credit card or camera or cell phone, but as a tourist, that cannot be avoided :) The grounds: There were 3 pools on the grounds. The pool in the center of the resort had some tables set up in the pool. Lounge furniture and hammocks, an unopened massage area, and a outside bar (but not in the pool, about 20 feet from pool). This is the only outside bar I noticed, and closes at 6pm on weekdays, bummer. Closer to the beach area there was a very small pool, and a larger \"cool\" pool with all the amenities - cabana's, lounge areas, swim-up bar, small waterfall. There were at least 4 hot tubs spread out throughout the grounds. The part of the bar that is swim up is in shade the whole day with the exception of about 3 of the water-bar stools. The pool water is relatively cold, but once you're in, is comfortable (in the sun). the beach: The hotel provides beach lounge chairs to all guests and follow you and place them wherever you want. There are private owned, small, food carts that walk up and down the beach & you can bring beverages to the beach as well. The ocean water is slightly warmer than the pool water. the waves are smaller, but still large enough to boogie board. The shallow regions of the water are full of seaweed and other ocean crud - you have to go out deeper than about 3-3.5 feet in water depth to get to cleaner water. Something that was in the shallow area, washed up weeds gave me numerous bites on my legs and torso; like mosquito bites. there's jet ski rental, banana boat rides, and massages all available right outside the resort on the beach there. food/beverage: Our trip was NOT all-inclusive (don't know if any are here...) and food and beverage are quite expensive on the resort. For example, a short tumbler (one shot with soda) of their local rum (Don Q) was $12 each. We ate at the Palms, which was very good and filling. We shared a lunch at the swim-up bar (the yellow rice is really good). We went to the Japanese hibachi place once and absolutely loved it - our chef was better than other chefs we have had (Orlando, Vegas, etc...) - the food was cooked perfect & delicious. We liked it so much we made a point to go again, this time we had a different chef, who was sub-par - if had him the first time don't think we would have went again; the food and hibachi presentation was only so-so this second time. (the good chef had a left sleeve of tattoos.) There was a small shopping area inside the hotel, a pizza place with gelato, and the small casino - which has everything you need in a casino; it is small, but perfectly sized for the amount of people that go. The 2 bars in the lobby are absolutely packed on weekend nights. There was a lounge bar off the lobby, which I never noticed open. there's a dance club in the hotel, small, but a nice setup. Seemed like drinks were actually cheaper in there than out in the lobby (hotel guests are on a list and get in free; non-guests have to pay to enter). Pool closes at 9pm (midnight swim not an option sadly). And everyone does clear out of the pool by about 4pm. The staff was very friendly. Every morning the hotel completely cleaned the pools. There is Walgreens a block from the hotel, liqour stores, and if you head right out of the hotel to the right there is a whole LOT of different restaurants (every different ethnic cuisine just about) & small shops - they start about 2 blocks away, easy walk. The hotel staff was friendly and accomodating.", "Date": "February 13, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "nyc", "Title": "\u201cEnjoyable due to fabulous staff\u201d", "Author": "tripsaway", "ReviewID": "UR124405965", "Content": "The hotel is 'tired' and really needs a face lift.

La Piccola Fontana was exceptional...expensive....and very crowded. You feel like you are eating at your neighbors table! Nice to start up conversations but not so great if looking for a romantic evening. They offer a special menu during the week with a specially priced bottle of wine which was well worth it.

Between hearing the people coming off and on the elevator as well as the elevators CONSTANTLY zooming up and down it was annoying to say the least. The worst part however, was the bathroom! It was so ridiculously small that I'm not even sure why they had a door on it at all because it's not as if you could actually close it! The door opened right into the toilet, like the door just barely cleared the toilet! The sink was just a small pedestal crammed between the toilet and the tub.

On first glance, it looks luxurious and trendy. But ten minutes after I entered my room, I was already on the phone with housekeeping to sweep the floor. Here's the breakdown: PROS: 1. The lobby is the most happening lobby that I've seen in a long time....many many many people were there on Friday and Saturday nights. The dancing was fun and the live bands were great. 2. The staff were courteous....but not always helpful. Read the con below. We didn't encounter any rudeness at all. CONS 1. The rooms are nicely decored, but are in shabby condition. The shower especially needs updating. The size of the room was ok, but I see that many reviewers complain about the quality of the rooms. 2. Drinks were good, but very expensive! 3. There are no refrigerators to rent. I like to have a fridge in my hotel rooms for my own stash of drinks and fruit etc ...otherwise you spend a fortune on hotel drinks and snacks. 4. The pool is nice (please note that barely any hotels in Puerto Rico have heated pools), but I noticed that few chairs are actually situated around the pool! Most chairs had poor views. 5. The concierge was extremely unhelpful. All they want to do is book you something. They couldn't even give me information on a snorkeling beach! They just had information on a snorkeling tour. 6. I was upgraded to a room with a vista view, as they did not have any rooms with king size beds left. The view was ridiculous! Yes, we could see the beach, but the room looked out to the parking lot! Give me a break. Stay at the intercontinental, which is a 3 minute walk to the el san Juan. The rooms come with balconies, complimentary refrigerators, and have better views.

When we booked the trip we were under the impression that the hotel is owned by the Waldorf Astoria chain. We found out before our arrival that the hotel is now owned by the Hilton hotel chain. Having stayed at other Waldorf hotels we had been expecting the same level of service and attention to detail that we experienced at those hotels. We were a little skeptical after learning that the hotel was now owned by Hilton but felt, based on many of the TripAdvisor reviews, that we would be happy. Upon entering the lobby of the El San Juan Resort it was hard not to be impressed. The lobby is accurately represented on it's website and is very well maintained. We saw the difference when we got to our room. Although the room was clean, it wasn't immaculate. Little details like chipped tile and smudges on the white leather sofa as well as a few small tears in the drapes made it clear that the attention (and money for upkeep) is spent in the lobby. We liked that the hotel had several restaurants in the lobby including Koko (where we dined twice - the food and cocktails were amazing and Joe, bartender, was very friendly and very attentive), an Italian restaurant and a Japanese restaurant. We had takeout for lunch from the Japanese restaurant twice (the sushi was extremely fresh) and had dinner at the Italian restaurant our first evening (the mushroom risotto was delicious). We had been told by the hotel rep., when we booked the trip, that the lobby was a favorite spot for locals and tourists on Friday and Saturday evenings. It is \"the place to see and be seen\" according the to rep. Because of this he told us that the hotel was very strict about the evening dress code. Absolutely no jeans, shorts or tee-shirts after 7 p.m. Although my husband would not wear shorts and a tee-shirt in the evening, he had planned to wear jeans. I sent an e-mail to the hotel and called the hotel directly to confirm what I was told. I never received a reply to my e-mail but was told by the front desk that this was in fact true and that the dress code is enforced. I can tell you that nothing is further from the truth. Our first night, Friday, about half the men in the lobby were wearing jeans. On Saturday night, not only were the majority of men under age sixty wearing jeans, several were wearing shorts. These were non-hotel guests whom I saw enter through the front doors where they could have easily been turned away if the dress code was valid. The pool area and beach were nice but lacking the same attention to detail obvious in the guest rooms. These areas were also very crowded. On our third day, we got to the pool at 10:00 a.m. only to find all but one of the covered double lounge \"chairs\" was taken. On the beach, there was some litter (plastic cups and food wrappers) in the spot were the \"pool boy\" put our chairs. I thought he would pick it up after setting up the chairs. He did not. That would not have happened at a Waldorf hotel. The service of the hotel staff was very average. The front desk staff was friendly but not well informed about sightseeing in Old San Juan or restaurants and shops outside the hotel. The bartenders in the hotel lobby were poor at best both in timeliness and friendliness.

I picked this hotel because I wanted to be right in the heart of the action but it was not \"happening\" during the day and the rooms were gross.

The bathrooms have a lot of mold and dirty grout--I wouldn't take my flip flops off the entire trip. Service: the service was especially bad on our first night SOMEONE TRIED TO BREAK INTO OUR ROOM through the connector; when we reported this to the front desk and asked to move they showed no concern--no one from security ever contacted us to get a report or find out what went on. We asked to have our room changed b/c I felt unsafe staying next to the person that tried to break in (here's what happened: at 12:30a we were awakened to someone fussing with the lock on the connector door; not until I said someone is in here did it stop. But earlier, when we got back to our room after the beach, we found a guy in the hallway knocking frantically on the next room door, when we got in our room we found the connector door unlocked (lucky I checked) but nothing touched, not until the 2nd attempt did we realize the guy in the hallway was probably a lookout and the next door guy had already been in our room, we just got back early and \"foiled\" his attempt) Nonetheless, when we asked to have our room changed 4 times, they gave us no priority and no one went out of their way to try to accommodate us. I understand they were near sell out but we would have appreciated if they would have done more to have us moved earlier and followed up to make sure we got one of the 1st rooms available and then again after the move to see if everything was ok. No employees say hello when walking around, no sense that in general you are being taken care of or catered to. No \"hospitality\" at this hotel. EXCEPT: Angelo the bellman at the door was happy and cheerful, friendly and kind everytime we saw him. Everyone at the hotel should be like him! Spa: We went up to the spa to inquire about services and the girl didn't explain anything about the spa or treatments but just said \"when do you want to come--because we don't have anything now\"...um, we don't even know if we want to yet...better to get a massage on the beach. Pool: I wanted to stay b/c I thought the lobby is happening at night, it must be happening at pool during the day...not the case.

She came through like a champ. Put us as far away from the elevators as possible on the East side of the hotel. (The night club is really loud and people we spoke with whose rooms were on the west end of the hotel said it was very loud on Friday and Saturday night). Our room was fine. The bathroom is small and the shower tile could use a good scrubbing but nothing too bad. We had no complaints at all with the room. The beach is pretty good. The chair guys are very attentive and the wait service was decent. (If you want a great lunch, walk 50 yards down the beach to the Ciao Mediterranean Cafe. The lunch was definitely better than the ok lunch we got at ESJ). The food at the Piccola Fontana (the small Italian restaurant in the ESJ) was very good. Not cheap (nothing at ESJ is cheap unfortunately) but very good. If you're expecting a 5 Star Waldorf Astoria-type room you will be disappointed in the room.

It is a shame because people who read my numerous inquiries direct to hotel management with only one response from 6 weeks ago stating that they would review and get back to me. I'm still waiting Susan Wilkerson on emails sent on 12/19/11, 12/22/11, 12/29/11, and 1/5/12. The other couple that came with us has contacted Hilton and is also still awaiting a response. Extremely poor customer service on charge inquiries. The very short summary is that I stayed at the ESJ Hotel with my wife, 1 year old daughter and another couple from December 5 - 9, 2011. Prior to arriving, I called on December 2 to inquire on having adjoining rooms to allow for easy monitoring of our baby who naps 2 times per day. December 2, we were charged $95 from the hotel shortly after making the phone call without warning of this charge. December 5, we arrive at ESJ Hotel and we are assigned rooms across the hotel from each other. We mention we called on 12/2 about adjoining rooms and a crib. ESJ assigns us rooms next to each other but not adjoining which is fine but we also have to wait another hour for a crib to be delivered. Again not a huge deal but we did call ahead, were told we would have adjoining rooms, crib would be ready, and later (days AFTER checkout) finally find out that the $95 charge from 12/2 was because of the phone call we made requesting adjoining rooms. They stated the $95 fee was for the room change which was never addressed and not reimbursed and emails/phone calls to hotel management still haven't been addressed. Still awaiting Susan Wilkerson's response. The other issue was that we were charged $190.00 per night for our room which was $38 per night more than we had reserved it for. Our friends in the room next door, which was exactly the same setup and size as ours, were charged the quoted amount of $152.00 per night. Upon checkout, I inquired of this difference and the lady assisting us said she did not know and that we should contact the reservation phone number. I contacted Susan Wilkerson via email about this item as well on 4 separate occasions (see previous dates of emails listed above) and still awaiting a response. I can only assume that the difference was for the additional baby we brought with us. If this is the reason for the additional $190.00 in charges, it goes against Hilton hotels family policy as well as ESJ's policy. If I was charged for the additional occupancy, the room they put us in was not rated for (3) occupants. I should have been placed in a different room rated for this occupancy if this is the reasoning for the additional $38.00 per night. Did I mention that Susan Wilkerson still hasn't responded to our repeated email inquiries. The pools and breakfast were great and much of the staff were friendly.

The rooms like they were decorated with furnishings from Target. I think they were going for a minimalist, white theme but what they got was a sterile, plastic feel. The room was not soothing to say the least. We had a weird security issue where we returned after dinner to find our hotel room door wide open....anyone walking by could see our entire room. As far as we can see nothing was taken, thankfully we had our valuables in the hotel safe. We called security and got a very unsatisfactory outcome as their equipment was down and they were unable to tell us whose room key was used to enter the room. We demanded a room change and were given it but I can tell you that the front desk treated it as more of annoyance to them than an issue of concert to me.

There are some positives to the hotel such as the location on the beach is absolutely beautiful and the main lobby area is gorgeous. The chairs provided on the beach is a paradise for beach goers. For a Hilton I was surprised by the upkeep and service of the hotel.... Let me paint a picture. On arrival we had a room on the third floor and had to drag our luggage up three flights of stairs due to the elevator not working in our portion of the hotel. That's fine we can totally handle that. Then we showed up in our room and it was pretty but there was an open bag of chips that was left with crumbs in our closet. After discovering that we asked the front desk to double check the mini-bar to make sure nothing else was missing. At check out they tried to charge me for a few different items from the mini-bar, which we did not use. They thankful took the $50 purchases off my tab. Another disappointment was the jacuzzi heaters were down for three nights. My friends and I had a few active adventures and all you want to do is rest and relax in the jacuzzi. We had to contact the concierge to figure out what was going on and they had no idea when the heaters would be back up. We stayed 7 days at this hotel and had to deal with a leaky sink for about three full days. We originally thought that we had dragged the water into the bathroom somehow only to find the puddle in our bathroom every afternoon and morning after getting in from the beach. I informed the front desk and they sent someone to look who said they couldn't fix it till morning. Morning came around and the people who were suppose to fix our sink left and didn't do anything... I had to remind the front desk that our sink was leaking quite a bit of water onto our tile. It was just disappointing to have to deal with a leaky sink while on vacation. There wasn't even an offer to change rooms and the hotel was definitely not full. FYI it is a $20 cab ride to old san juan and the airport.

So that means no afternoon cocktails on your balcony watching the sunset...a huge negative in my opinion. Like 85% of the other reviewers, I had to request a room change during our stay. I am a Hilton Honors Gold member and upon check-in I am supposed to automatically receive an upgrade. After confiming this with the person who checked us in, we were given a room on the 7th floor with a view of a TREE! You couldn't see anything else, how is that an upgrade???????????? We went to the lobby, where we stood in line behind numerous other guests who were there to complain about their rooms as well. Even after expressing our disappointment in the view, we were only moved 2 rooms over so we got a slightly better view. We stayed M-F and the hotel was definitely NOT at full capacity. You would think being a HH Gold member that they would of gone above and beyond to please us. If you are a frugal consumer like myself, then DO NOT order drinks from the hotel. We ordered a pina colada and margarita from the hotel bar and it cost $27. These were very small plastic glasses. Instead, walk to the Pueblo grocery store (walk past the Chili's approx 1/2 miles and pick up your beer/wine there). There are no rules against BYOB to the beach. If you really want to plan ahead, pack a little lunch cooler from home that you can fill up with ice in the hotel and pack your refreshment of choice. Was also disappointed/astonished with the breakfast offered. Again, being a HH member I received vouchers for free continental breakfast. Even with the voucher, you have to pay an additional $10 to receive any hot items (eggs, pancackes, etc). If you are not a HH member, the cold continental breakfast will cost you $15/pp...if you add hot items it goes up to $25/pp. However, if you walk about 1/4 mile to Don Jose's Restaurant you can order pancakes for $2.95!! Speaking of food, we ate a La Piccola one night. Food was good, however very $$$$$. Don't expect to leave for under $100-$125 for 2 people. Our server Michael was very very friendly. To save some money go eat at Platos restaurant (again, only 1/4 mile from the hotel). We ate there 2 out of 4 nights. Great local Puerto Rican cuisine and really friendly staff. To get to Old San Juan, be prepared to wait up to 30 mins for the bus outside the hotel. But for only $.75 is worth the wait (you must have exact change). The ride takes approx 45 mins. To address the noise complaints I will say this. Monday through Wednesday we didn't hear a peep. However, on Thursday around 1:30 am I woke up and could hear the music from the lobby (all the way on the 8th floor)!! Bottom line, there is a reason why Hilton HAS NOT put their name on the property even though they own it. If you are use to a typical Hilton hotel, then don't stay here!

If you are able to get a good rate, grab it. If you've never stayed at El San Juan Resort, you'll wish you had the instant you step into the hotel lobby. This is one of the most unique hotels I've ever seen. Huge ceilings with antique wood frames and marble floors, style and glamour throughout. They often have life salsa in the lobby where people will dance. Also in the lobby, you'll find 3 completely separate and very stylish bars, each with a unique vibe that makes you want to stop and have a drink. A cozy little casino is off to the right, where you'll find a few blackjack tables, craps, and several slots. (They have $5 dollar minimum tables for guests who want to get more play out of their budget:) and free drinks are served while you play (by a gorgeous staff). The outdoor patio, pool, and beachfront are also where it's at. Several places to hang out, including rows of shady lounge couches, and a small pool bar with bar stools in the water. This pool area will make you want to drink, especially if with friends! Of course, drinks are around $11 each. By the beachfront, you can rent jetskis for $40 per hour, or get a massage in the sand. If you want real carribean cuisine, walk to Platos, which is 2 minutes walking to your left sangli exit the hotel. If you want to stay at the resort, there are SEVERAL restaurants within the resort, including a BBQ joint on the roof, Palm in the lobby (with a GREAT happy hour), as well as a few others (a Mexican, highly-rated Italian, and carribean place). There is also a small string of high end shops, souviner shops, and boutiques in the hotel. *They also have a small wine shop where they sell hand-rolled local cigars you may enjoy after a hard day at the pool :) They actually have an Enterprise car rental agency in the hotel, which can be convenient if you want to explore PR but don't want to hassle with it at the airport (note there are no kiosks for rental car agencies in the San Juan airport - you have to call them from numbers posted in the airport). The enterprise in the hotel opens at 8am... The basic rooms are set up in a spacious, lounge-like feel. White tile floors, low profile bed, trendy couch and sitting area. Clean rooms, comfortable bed. Isle verde is a $8-$10 cab ride to San Juan. It is really a relaxing and fun location to stay, even if your intention is to explore San Juan. An this resort has it all. I'm usually a little more practical with hotels, but I would easily spend the extra buck for a stay at El San Juan, because you really feel like a king in a playland at this resort and it's worth it, if even for 1 night. I paid $200 for 1 night in mid December. That was an awesome rate fir what I got. I know they charge a lot more in te high season... But I hope they lower it because there is a lot of solid competition in the area I would say a good rate is anything under $300. If this was useful, please click \"useful\" below.

Exactly a year ago we stayed at the Caribe Hilton and had a much better experience there. Our feelings not to return is partly due to simple personal preference: we prefer the tropical open-air and casual lobby/bar area of the Caribe as opposed to the ornate, overly air conditioned! lobby area of the El San Juan. We were also a bit put-off that there was a dress code in the lobby (but yet it seemed okay that young kids ran around playing tag and swinging on the beaded curtains of the swanky nightclub as visitors attempted to enjoy a quite evening cocktail). The pools and the grounds were very nice and comparable to the Caribe. Two things which we did like about the El San Juan over the Caribe is its location near many nice local restaurants and shops AND the very nice and wide beach area. As far as our room goes, we weren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t too pleased at the El San Juan. While the room appeared to be clean, it needed some serious updating. The beauty and elegance of their lobby in no way matches that of their guest rooms. But our biggest complaint was the noise level and the fact that we could often smell cigarette smoke (it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s supposedly a smoke-free hotel). We easily heard people coming and going from the rooms at all times of night and morning. [Incidentally, we left our San Juan trip and went straight to the Millennium Hilton in New York City to celebrate New Year\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Eve last night. That one-night stay really put things into perspective for us. It was SO, SO much more comfortable, sleek and amazingly quiet! Of all nights, I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m sure people were coming in at all times of the night, but we didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t hear one peep!] Since my husband is a Hilton Diamond member he has stayed at many different Hiltons and he felt (and I agree) that the El San Juan just isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t up to the usual Hilton standard of hotels. One cab driver in Puerto Rico put it perfectly: when it used to be a Waldorf, the rooms were very nice and worthy of the Waldorf name.

(Never mind that the rooms look over an acre of air conditioning units.) Moreover, screws were loose on many drawers, rust was on virtually every piece of metal (and rust stood on every treadmill in their gym), and the whole room, from floor to furniture, looked like formica.

It's certainly not the hotels fault, but some parents do not correct their children and let them run wild. The beach area was great. Umbrellas and chairs were provided for quest. Also, other water sports were available for rent. The bars and casino was great. I just wish the slot machines would have been as lucky as the tables!! We ate at all of the restaurants. They were very good. The morning Buffett is lovely and I just wish, again, that parents would correct their children. Playing bouncy ball indoors is inappropriate in a hotel of this caliber.

I expected it to be first class service and nice rooms. Overall, average to poor experience. Check in, we had to wait till 4 to get a room, the front desk gave us no information on the hotel, where to eat, any ammenties etc. Just handed us a key. Pros: Nice lobby, beautiful and historic Good location from airport and Old San Juan- quick cab ride $20 spent 2 days in town Casino good for a location in San Juan Pool is large and has nice chairs, hot tubs, good layout. Cons: Room is very modern which would be fine if it was clean! The furniture is white and filthy, bedspread was not clean, wallpaper falling off in bath, tile old in bathroom and shower all moldy, floors are tile and were filthy the maid never cleaned them the whole time we were there even after complaining. They also never cleaned the bathroom, just made bed and left towels. They are lacking information in regards to the hotel, restaurants, activites, hours of shops etc..there was no info book in the room. No info on wireless, room service etc..not usual for upscale hotel. Maid was cleaning rooms next to us at 830am moving furniture, loud music, singing, woke us up, very rude. Went up to my room on Saturday night and there were 5 policeman lined up in the hall guarding the room next to mine, they were hauling out people and allot of commotion going on. Not a good feeling. The beach even though I know the hotel does not control, was filthy. Cigarette butts, garbage everywhere, chairs old, police driving back and forth, just felt like a dirty city beach. Went down to the Ritz Carlton right next door, the beach there beautiful and clean and service excellent for same room rates. Overall, it is a party hotel where they have allot of local events and hot night club. I would not stay here again or refer my clients unless they wanted a total party hotel, not a place to relax and good service or clean rooms. I stayed at the Ritz a few blocks down for the same price, service excellent, beach clean and nice, pool smaller but plenty of chairs. Rooms clean and fresh.

When you first walk in, you think its just a hotel, but the grounds are set up as a resort which is exactly what I went for...pool, beach, swim up bar, whirlpool, etc. Very relaxing time and the fact that the hotel was not super busy helped. The room was fine, but the bathroom small, with a bit of need for maintenance with a standup shower only that can barely fit two people if you're looking to have romantic showers. Because the decor was mainly white, stains showed up on everything which if you're sensitive to that kind of thing, stands out. Walls are paper thin also so beware. There was an adjoining room and I heard every bit of conversation and laughter. From a budget standpoint, BEWARE. I specifically asked about fees upon checking in and was told that everything was paid for. All I put down was the incidental deposit of $200. Imagine my surprise when I got back less than a $100!! The resort fee of $21 a day was something I should have known according to the front desk. If I pre-paid for my hotel and flight via a third party, any other fees should have been mentioned upon check-in. As someone who planned for this trip and budgeted and spent according to my means, I was very upset and the hotel was unapologetic and unaccomodating. My rate plan did come with breakfast which was $25 a day so I guess they got their money back. Speaking of breakfast, $53 dollars for the buffet for two people, and its continental breakfast with a small omelette station, bacon, sausage, potatoes and mini pancakes. If you go the contiental route only, its about $32 for two people. There was no local breakfast option. You should consider walking down the block to the left of the resort for other options. Don Juan was good for breakfast, lunch or dinner. Avg plate about $12. Walgreens is also down the block so if you get your own drinks including wine, you'd save tons of money. Ice machine in the hotel and some plastic cups you'll save yourself a lot of money. Hotel is packed on thursday to sat. Band and DJ plays in the lobby and there's dancing along with two bars. This is what you see when you walk into the hotel. There's also a club in the hotel so during these nights, definitely not a family hotel. Miscellaneous details...hotel is 7 min from hotel which is nice. Cab ride about $14 to $16 without the meter. Cab to Old San Juan is $20. Hotel is on the bus route which is .75. Its about an hour ride, but not bad if you have the time and want to do something local. Went to the fort which was a great piece of history and went to La Bambanero restaurant on San Francisco St. Old school restaurant but you must try the Mallorca sandwhich (sweet bread, pressed with butter, cheese, eggs). All in all, a good hotel in a good location for friends, couples or solo.

I'd have to give the hotel a mixed review but since there is more good than bad, I'll start with the cons. 1. Personnel - While everyone was very polite, they do have a staffing shortage at times. We encountered a problem on Saturday night and the one person at the desk could not help mostly because she was on all alone, doing check-ins, answering phones, trying to do everything, and stated that she would be on all alone until 7AM. I asked her to call a supervisor but she said none was available to call. I would not expect ANY period without supervision from a Hilton hotel of this size. 2. The resort charge, at 14%, doesn't include much - the use of the pool and fitness center, facilities that used to be included in the room charge until a few years ago. This was annoying, but I realize tacking on resort fees is a trend many hotels follow these days. 3. Problems with the Wifi-it took several days and two technicians to resolve them, and only by disconnecting me from Wi-fi altogether and hooking up some other piece that I returned when leaving. Now home, I can't get my computer to recognize the Wifi in my house and have to pay for a professional to come and resolve this. 4. Unexpected charges - there were several unexpected charges on our bill - $2.00 a day maid service and $10.50 for the bellhop. Since only the resort fees and taxes were disclosed when I made my reservation, I had already tipped the bellhop $10 when we arrived and the maid $5 a day. I wasn't about to tip again for the same service. At first they told me they could do nothing, that this was the contract made by the person who arranged the wedding. After I insisted my contract was with them, not the wedding host, and that they never disclosed the charge or I wouldn't have tipped separately, they did remove the charges. There were also charges for using the phone, which I had them remove since I used it at their direction to call AT&T in an attempt to get the Wifi working, as well as a charge for breakfast one day at the hotel, which we never had. This too was removed. The pros: 1. Susan Wilkerson - I agree with previous posters who called her an asset to the hotel. Having read about the noise, I e-mailed ahead and reconfirmed my request for a high floor and was given a room on the 9th floor. Perfectly quiet, and the room was spacious, and despite other people's experiences, our bathroom was a reasonable size. The room also overlooked the ocean and the bed was very comfortable. 2. They did make good on my inconvenience concerning the WiFi. I used the business center several times while it wasn't working, and at my request, they took the charges I had to pay for that use off the hotel bill, as well as any charges for the little bit they did get our computer working. 3. The casino was just the right size - not overwhelmingly big but with plenty of variety and plenty of penny slots for those of us who aren't big betters but enjoy playing. 4. On Friday night the lobby was a magnificent display of entertainment and dance which was nice to watch at our own convenience, when noise was not an issue to us. This continued to a lesser extent on other days during the week. 5. The wedding set-up was lovely and they were able to make last minute arrangements to change seating when a short rain rendered the original area too wet to sit in comfort. 6. We did try several of the restaurants for dinner. They are overpriced in general, but each had a fixed price menu that was reasonable and with adequate choice, and by sticking to that, we got the good food and lovely atmosphere without breaking the bank. 7. Maid service was timely and adequate each day. They also provided turn-down service. 8. The two pools were lovely and I had no trouble getting towels or finding chairs. Would I go back again? Yes, but I'd ask ahead of time if any gratuities would be charged, make sure I get a high floor room again, and e-mail Susan Wilkerson again in advance.", "Date": "November 19, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "2", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Manassas, Virginia", "Title": "\u201cGeared towards nightlife, not a family hotel\u201d", "Author": "LGross13", "ReviewID": "UR120749351", "Content": "My family (my husband, 2 year old daughter and I) stayed at this hotel for a long weekend with a \"discounted\" rate, as we were part of a group staying at the hotel for a Sunday wedding. The resort fees and taxes are estimated fairly well in the confirmation email received after we booked, besides the $10.50 bellman charge (I have never seen a hotel that charges for a bell hop service in my life!) and the daily maid gratuity, which is mandatory, whether they clean the room or not. Having seen our room was not cleaned one day, we requested maid service from the front desk at 5pm. We came back to a dirty room at 10pm. At check-out they would not remove the maid gratuity for that day. Being that it was only $2.00, not something I wanted to fight over, but it shows poor customer service in my opinion. The front desk and concierge were never overly friendly or helpful during our stay. The staff working grounds maintenance were always smiling and greeting you as you walked by, and were much more polite than the staff that is supposed to be service-oriented. Knowing other people staying at the hotel, we got to see a variety of room layouts and we certainly got the worst room of the group. We were in the main building (which has been renovated with a modern decor) right next to the elevator in room 726. Besides having to hear drunk guests shouting all night (which I know is not the hotel's fault) the elevator cables would bang against the wall, directly above the headboard of our bed every time the elevator passed. Our room overall, was smaller than others we saw in the main building and the bathroom was SO SO small, you could not open and close the door without squeezing passed the door as it swung shut. There was no counter space for toiletries, and the small shower had no tub (it's hard to shower a toddler, a tub would have been more convenient for a family). Even in the bigger bathrooms I saw in the main building, there is no place to hang dry clothing, which I really think is an important function of a pool/beach hotel. None of the rooms in the main building had balconies. I heard from other people in our party that levels 5 and below heard the night club or lobby music (which is very loud in the evenings) in the rooms. The garden building had larger rooms, larger bathrooms (with bathtubs), a walk-in closet as well as patios or balconies. They were not renovated, so the styling was older. We requested to move to the garden building after the first night experiencing the noise level in our room, but we were told the building was full. If you stay here, request the garden building and sacrifice the style for function and space! The pools, beach and general grounds were clean and well maintained. I notice some reviews complaining about the seaweed on the beach, but I did see a machine raking it in the early mornings so at least they attempt to clean it. The beach is not fantastic for a tropical location, so if that it what you are looking for, choose a hotel on the east side of the island. The pool towels are small and dingy, plain and simple. There is a Walgreen's within walking distance, that sells beach towels for $4. A worthy investment in my opinion. The pool hut runs out of clean towels by the afternoon, so grab a towel in the morning and keep it! We made the mistake of turning our wet towels in too early on the first day, expecting to be able to get fresh towels for our afternoon swim. A note about the main building: cover-ups are required in the lobby. Personally, I don't see the need for the rule, but I respected it. But, I hated having to get my cover-up wet just to walk through the lobby, knowing there was no place in the room to hang it up to dry. The pool bar and restaurant was way overpriced, had bad food and bad service. The rum drinks (with not a lot of rum in them) were $12 and lunch items $12-$15, which wouldn't be so bad if the food was any good. We did not eat breakfast or dinner at the resort so I can't comment on those. There is a cafe close by ( http://www.yelp.com/biz/piu-bello-gelato-isla-verde ) that had good breakfast food at reasonable prices. There is a Mexican restaurant right next door to the hotel that may be tempting to visit, but we had horrible food and service there ( http://www.yelp.com/biz/lupis-mexican-grill-isla-verde ).

The wood rail outside the room looks like it has not been painted in years, the paint is cracking a peeling. There is a small table in the bathroom that is rusting. There are dust balls in the corners of the room, black spots on the ceiling (mold?). The beds do not have box springs. The ironing board is one of those tiny ones (1/3 size? Elf size?). They want to charge you $10 for a bottle of water in your room and nearly $6 for a 1.5 liter bottle in the gift shop; and a can of coke is $2+ in the shop (there is a Walgreens a couple doors down where you can buy goods for reasonable prices). I could go on but I am sure you got the idea. This is a very, very tired property in desperate need of renovation. And the staff is erratic, some are very lovely people and others are just downright rude; but even with the nice ones you can tell the training has been woefully inadequate. It is a real shame, Puerto Rice itself is amazing place and they are some amazing hotels here (La Concha by Renaissance, Hilton Caribe, and the Sheraton by the convention center \u00e2\u20ac\u201c which by the way is amazing if you are just here on business, unfortunately it is not by the beach).", "Date": "November 15, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "michigan", "Title": "\u201cDisappointing - Not as nice as everyone says\u201d", "Author": "hobiecatsailor", "ReviewID": "UR120580509", "Content": "I spent two nights at this hotel. Leading up to my stay I had high expectations of this property because I had heard nothing but good reviews about it. From the valet parking attendant to the front desk check in, I was unimpressed by the cold, unfriendly service I received. In comparison with the atmosphere of the Conrad Hotel in Condado, where I frequently stay during my trips to San Juan, the service was not measuring up. After checking in and making my way to my room, I did not like it as much as the caliber of room that I usually receive at the Conrad Hotel in Condado, San Juan. The bathroom in particular was very small in comparison and there is some noticeable wear and tear in the shower tiles. The bathroom was not clean upon my arrival and I had to call housekeeping to come to the room to clean it more thoroughly before I could use it. It took 1/2 hour to get the housekeeping staff to the room. Once they arrived, they had a attitude that was less than service oriented and I was given the impression that it was a hassle for them. The view from the room was looking down on all of the A/C units on the roof and there was a considerable amount of noise coming from them. The noise from the planes taking off and landing at the nearby airport continued throughout the day and night. If you are going to stay in Isla Verde just plan on hearing loud noise from the nearby airport, it is inevitable. There are several restaurants and shops within the hotel and this is nice. I also liked the fact that they have 2 Starbuck's locations within the hotel. This just is not my idea of a nice vacation...it felt cold, impersonal, and too large for my style.", "Date": "November 14, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Bel Air, Maryland", "Title": "\u201cFun Mini-Get Away...\u201d", "Author": "leebritt1022", "ReviewID": "UR120479120", "Content": "My sister and I (24 and 29 years old) from Baltimore, MD just recently visited the El San Juan Resort and Casino from November 6th-11th, 2011 (Sunday to Thursday). Overall, I would give this resort a 3 out of 5 stars. Food... We are both avid travelers and have seen a lot with tropical resorts. This was our first non-all-inclusive in a very long time. We figured for the price we could save some money and try not to eat as much as we would normally would at a all-inclusive type resort. Well, that was very true because the average cost of a cocktail was $10!!! Yes, $10!! and food was completely unreasonable. Our package came with a free \u00e2\u20ac\u0153American Breakfast Buffet\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd (which was a hassle to convince the front desk we even had) and that saved us $200 for the 4 nights- $25 PP per day. It was a good selection but not worth $25 PP. If you have a free buffet with your package I recommend you bring the print out or voucher with you as the front desk tried to tell us we didn't have it. They did honor our print out but we were not prepared to explain ourself in the beginning of the trip and then again at check out. As soon as we arrived we went to the local grocery store \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Pueblo\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd 5 minute walk and bought some snacks, water and alcohol. This was the smartest thing we did and was well worth it. We ate dinner at restaurants outside the resort as we couldn't see spending $$$$ for the restaurants in the hotel. We ate at some great places, Cafe Puerto Rico in Old El San Juan- that was amazing. Metropol Restaurant, 5 minute walk from the hotel- the best food ever! We just asked the server to order for us and it was so good. We tried to eat all the Puerto Rican foods and they were all delicious. We ate lunch at the resort- not much to choose from but it did the trick. We had a tuna pita, burger, grilled cheese... cant mess that up! Our favorite bar tender was Eric but he only worked on Sunday:( Jason was friendly too! Entertainment.... Since we traveled during the week entertainment was non-existent- NADA. The outside bar closed at 7pm, shops in town were closed early and there was nothing really going on. No entertainment at the hotel other then the casino and we are not gamblers... On Wednesday night they had someone playing the piano in the lobby but that was all. According to the locals everything happens on the weekends.... So be prepared if you are traveling during the week...The lobby was dark and not open-air so it didn't have the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153beach\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd feel. We wanted to be outside and hang outside but the bars outside by the beach and pool close at 7pm... Room... When we booked our room we had asked for 2 double beds. When we arrived at the hotel they had us down for a King Bed. I told them that was wrong and asked if we could change and they said they were completely booked and apologized. Luckily we are sisters and didn't mind cuddling:) We were shocked that they told us they were booked as the hotel appeared to be empty the entire them we were there. It was interesting to say the least. The room itself was great. Spacious, very comfortable bed and lots of pillows, down comforter and a sofa sitting area. The bathroom was small but did the job. We were only on the 4th floor so we didn't have much of a view. The maid service was great and timely. The ice machine on our floor was not working so we had to hit the other floors for ice and I don't think they ever had any intentions of fixing it. The AC in the room worked perfectly! No balconies though, that was a bummer. Beach/Pool... The outside pool area was very nice, spacious and maintained nicely. There was plenty of spots to relax and there was no fighting over lounge chairs. (like I said the place was empty). The bars didn't open until later and the music was smoothing. The beach area was nice when the seaweed was away. The crew didn't do a good job keeping the beach area clear and the seaweed smelled very bad. The ocean was warm and very pretty. Great long beach to walk along as well. The service at the pool wasn't great- when you think it would be since they are being tipped and we are paying $10-15 for a drink. We had to waive servers down- they wouldn't just ask if we needed anything or go out of their way. The hot tub was very nice, it felt like we were in a tropical paradise- it was hiding on top a hill and very relaxing. It rained a lot when we were there so that was our escape while we were waiting for the rain to pass over... The hotel was very generous with beach towels as well, we got two per person a day (they were so small) and the staff didn't mind. Activities... We heard from friends we met at the resort that the Bioluminescence and the Rain Forrest was a must but we had issues finding a tour company that would only pick two people up so it didn't happen for us. This resort didn't push excursions like the rest of them do so it was different in that perspective. We did rent a Jet Ski at the beach at the hotel (guys to the left) and it was super fun- rough but fun. It was $40 for a half hour and believe me a half hour is plenty of time:) We also both got massages on the beach, 30 minutes each for $45 a piece. Lisa was the message therapist and was amazing! So relaxing a must! We went to Old San Juan ($20 cab ride each way or 75 cents on the bus) and loved it there. I felt like we were in Europe. Fun to see all the history and culture. The shops close VERY early so go early (before 5pm) if you want to shop. Most bars were closed or dead during the week too. Overall, we had a great time!! It was good to see San Juan as we have never been there. I think this resort is more for work events and business trips. Everyone we met was there for work- not many families, couples or friends. I guess thats why they can get away with charging so much money for food and drinks!! If you have any questions on the resort or ear please let me know, I am here to help!

It is a beautiful hotel with a lot to offer. Ms. Noelia was very helpful giving us information on places to shop and things to do and see. Mr. Gregory was always kind and helpful to us whenever we had a question. Mr. Gregory always made sure we had what we needed at breakfast. The staff was attentive, friendly, and warm, from the checkin desk/concierge/bellhop (Ms. Noelia, Mr. Hery, Ms. Yvette?, Mr. Joel) to housekeeping (Ms. Jossie and Ms. Williams) to the folks who were responsible for the amazingly, stunningly beautiful landscaping. We enjoyed the contintental breakfast, the beach, the pools, the live music, the beautifully landscaped grounds, the shops, the amenities, the location, the overall tranquility/ambience, and the fact that the hotel's staff finds ways to improve and accomodate its guests. The hotel knows it can improve even more, and that is something we appreciate as guests. For example, we requested a shower rubber mat, and they searched high and low to find one for us. It took them a while, but the mat was in the shower when we got back to our room later that day. This hotel has so much to offer, and the location could not be better, right there in Isla Verde, not too far from Old San Juan, next to the highway (26), and right by the airport. There are many other places to eat, if you do not want to eat at the hotel, and there are shopping areas not too far from the hotel. The Condado neighborhood, which also has many eateries and great Puerto Rican food restaurants is right next to Isla Verde. Also, the local buses pass right in front of the hotel. We will return to this hotel and recommend it to folks we know.

A special thanks to Noelle at the front desk for going out of her way to make our experience exceptional. The stay began with a small issue with our room, and instead of being combative, she stepped right up with a smile, made us feel comfortable and in minutes, everything was perfect. Below I am reviewing the pros and cons, not that I rated this 5 0f 5. Nothing is perfect, but this was pretty close! The Pros- Bed is ridiculously comfortable Front desk staff is very nice, and they truly care about your experience. Our package included free breakfast, it was delicious- hot food that never runs out Pool staff is really nice as well, they make great drinks and have fun The pool is great in itself. The chairs are incredible and the cabanas make you never want to get up. The clientele the hotel attracts is great as well, we made a lot of friends in the casino, at the pool, and in the lobby (No trashy, classless folks with matching tramp stamps like other Caribbean resorts we have stayed at) The Lobby is a spectacle. There are 3-4 beautiful bars right in the heart of it. All the wealthy locals hang out in the lobby at night, there is live music and dancing, its amazing. The club inside is also very cool. The dealers at the casino were great, we left as winners! Walking distance to metropole, which is a great, cheap restaurant (get the smoked chicken) JetSkis are a must- but go to the guy on the left, if you are facing the ocean, when you walk on to the beach, not the people to the right. The guys on the right couldn't be more rude. Cons- The Casino waitress' couldn't have been slower or more rude if they tried. Order 2 drinks at a time. The hotel room walls were paper thin, you could hear EVERYTHING in the room that you share the adjoining door with The pictures of the rooms make the rooms to be crystal clean. The room could use a little touch up in the tile grout and the whites could be a little whiter. (the furniture whites, like the bed frame, the couches in the rooms, the throw pillows) Jetski people on the right, if facing the water, were completely rude. To end this on a positive note, this was the best vacation we have taken in years! Every hotel has pros and CONS, but these cons did not get in the way of our experience. We loved it there.

I combed through reviews before deciding we'd give this hotel a try for our 1 week get-away. We had stayed at the Ritz Carlton the previous year, but had eaten here and seen then amazing hotel lobby. I called and requested a connecting room. We were 3 sisters with 2 little girls - connecting rooms make life easier! I actually called to make the reservation and then called again 1 week out to confirm. Based on reviews, I asked for a room that was far away from the nightclub because of the kids and I also requested that our rooms were connecting. I even emailed Susan Wilkerson (as many below here suggest) to confirm we had a quiet room and that was connecting. We arrived on Monday and got our rooms. Service was very quick. We were on the 3rd floor. Rooms were not connecting, so I went downstairs and they were quick to find something connecting. I mentioned twice while looking that we needed something quiet. So, we ended up in rooms 329 and 331. Not a great view, but we weren't really spending time in the rooms all that much anyways. Rooms are clean and well-appointed. Kids LOVED the swim up bar. Plenty of seating around the pool. Many pools to chose from. We had a great time. Food/restaurants around the pools had limited options, but we enjoyed and had a great time. Pretty beach as well! Fast forward to Thursday and Friday night. Loud club music came on at 10pm. It was actually louder when you put your head down on the pillow - because the club was almost directly below the room. The hotel was completely booked, so we were told moving rooms was impossible. Kids didn't sleep, I didn't sleep.... no one slept. We finally turned the TV on to CNN to bring some white noise into the room. On Friday night, we had to call security because the room next to us was blaring rap music. Security had the issue resolved within 30 minutes, but it was 1am in the morning. Obviously, it was a pain to wake up out of my half sleep from the club music to deal with even louder rap music. Kudos to security on their quick response time. By Saturday, we were all cranky, tired and ready to leave. Not how you want to leave vacation. Another issue as a side note -- 1. Our room key device stopped working. Couldn't get into our room. They promised to fix it and sent a guy up. I guess he didn't have the right part, so they promised to fix it the next morning. Didn't happen. Wasn't a big deal though, because we had the connecting room and just went thru the other door. 2. First night we were there we noticed a huge line of ants that literally wrapped around the room. Maybe the folks before us had room service in here? We were too exhausted from pool/beach to deal with it that night. Next morning, we told the front desk and they took care of it that day. They must have sprayed something, because we had a bunch of dead ants all around the room. All in all - great beaches and pools. Fantastic lobby. Service was hit or miss. Obviously, emailing Susan Wilkerson is also hit or miss. We had a \"miss.\" My tips moving forward - insist on a room above the 5th floor. Do NOT stay on the 3rd floor unless you are partying with the club until 4am. Yes, 4am. Tips for food/supplies - Walgreens is just 2 short blocks away. Stock up on sunscreen, snacks, drinks! Piu Bello - just before Walgreens. Great little breakfast spot. We went every day. Very inexpensive. They knew our names by the 2nd day. Very friendly. There is also a full starbucks in the building too! Best dinner we had was at Platos. Great drinks, dinner, seafood. Loved it.

I choose this hotel due to reviews found here and the close proximity to the beach so we wouldn't have to waste travel time. What can I say about this hotel but WOW! While the hotel is going thru transition (it is now part of the Hilton chain) they are not lacking in great customer service and that was truly refreshing. We had a couple of issues that were promptly addressed and we were contacted directly by the manager who apologized profusely and went above and beyond to make our stay memorable. The hotel has several restuarants that offer a variety of foods for every tatse bud, the pools are gorgeous, the beach was amazing and the staff were friendly, couteous and knowledgable. The hotel is about 7 minutes from the airport and in walking distance to a 24hr supermarket, bars, clubs and other places to eat, but the hotel itself has a nightclub, a casino and bars with live music that seemed to stay jamming on the friday and saturday night we were there....The only drawback we found and people were very honest in their reviews is that it is pricey, it'd be nice if they offered some type of meal/drink plan to make it more affordable, the best value by far was the $25 breakfast buffet which was plentiful and delicious, and although things are pricey you are paying for premium and i'd rather that over crap, another drawback we found was for someone my husbands size (6'7) the shower is a bit tight but we were ok for just 2 nights..the rooms are very swanky they ook just like the pics which i liked since some of the pics on websites can be deceiving....We will return here gladly but definetely for longer than a weekend...this is the way customer service used to be i am glad they still maintain it here!

Granted, I didn't take advantage of everything the hotel has to offer in such a short stay, but I did enjoy all parts of my stay. The front desk staff at check-in was courteous and professional. We found our room to be clean, modern, and spacious. (The main lobby and casino area is furnished in dark wood and feels like a posh lounge from the 30s, to my un-educated eye; but our room was white and contemporary). Our room was great--for the 5 of us staying there, we had PLENTY of space. We booked a deal for the room price on Priceline, and so the view out our window was of a roof...but going down to the pool or beach area easily remedied this problem. The pools are breathtaking...an absolutely great place to relax away a Sunday afternoon. Lay in a comfortable beach chair and stair up at the green palms against the bluest of skies. The night we were there, we went to the club in the hotel, Brava. We got in for free as guests of the hotel, though as we came to the line, they had the wrong name listed as being in our room, so we had to go to the front desk and get a print-out with the correct names. This was the only hiccup in our stay, and we still got into the club within 5 minutes or so. The club itself was quite a good time--good music, packed with young people as the night went on. I would definitely stay at the El San Juan again. I didn't try out any of the restaurants--I've heard they're pricy, as you'd expect--but good and economical dining options can be found outside of the hotel property (within walking distance, if you like).", "Date": "October 16, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "new york, ny", "Title": "\u201cGorgeous pools, beaches, hospitality, location. 5 STARS.\u201d", "Author": "PKBrooklyn", "ReviewID": "UR119332514", "Content": "We booked a jetblue vacation package that included hotel, flight, car to San Juan. We were hesitant to stay in San Juan as opposed to closer to El Yunque or Fajardo, but I am SO happy we stayed here. 1. The layout, pools, hot tubs (there are three!) beach, service and hospitality were bar none. Everything was very clean, every staff person greets you with a smile and hello. The pool chairs range from cushioned chaises to canopied beds. The beach was also beautiful and clean. When we first checked in to the hotel it was about 10am. Even though we were super early to check in, Yvonne at concierge completely upgraded us to a junior suite! What a surprise! The room, the service, and the view was simply spectacular. 2. Tips on sightseeing. You must see Playa Flamenco in Culebra!! The ferry leaves from Fajardo - a one hour drive from El San Juan. Go on the first ferry of the morning which leaves at 9am. Buy a roundtrip ticket ($4.50). The ferry is 1.5 hours. Do not sit on the outdoor portion or the diesel fumes will kill you. I highly recommend sitting on the innermost portion away from the fumes. Feel free to bring a cooler with you - we bought a styrofoam one from Walgreens located on the same street as El San Juan. Beware, there are no glass bottles of any kind allowed on Flamenco Beach - so bring cans!! When you disembark the ferry there are drivers lining up to take you to whatever beach you want. Look for the Playa Flamenco sign. You can buy a one way or roundtrip ticket. The driver you want to go with is named Willy - he'll take 2 people roundtrip on the bus for $5. He gives you his cell number just in case, and he knows everything about Culebra and is very funny. There are many kiosks selling food and beer on the beach in case you run out :) You can rent beach chairs and umbrella for $25. Okay the best part about playa flamenco is that it is the most beautiful beach in the world. The water is clear for hundreds of feet out. The sand doesn't get hot, the scene is like a movie - gorgeous landscape and people! 3. Old San Juan is a 10 minute drive from El San Juan hotel. It's great for the day to walk around and grab lunch, buy some souvenirs. You should park in one of the parking garages as soon as you enter old san juan - it's about $2.15/hour. Try to jump into the trolley - it's a free ride around town. Grab a map from the front desk of the hotel and it's very well laid out of old san juan, very easy to navigate the area. 4. Because the drinks are kinda pricey at the hotel pool bars, try to bring your own cans of medalla (puerto rican beer). We brought down cans of pringles and other snacks since the pool bars only have entree type food. I would definitely stay at El San Juan ten times over again and look forward to our next trip back.

I read the reviews after I booked my room. I booked a promotion with the 4th night free and breakfast included. Great price. Location is great. I moved out from PR 5 years ago and I knew I was going to be close to everything. I was concerned about a lot of things when I read the reviews on Trip Advisor. I sent an email prior to my arrival to Ms Susan Wilkersen as other people mentioned. She upgraded us and we had our room ready at 1pm when we arrived. Thanks Susan!!! She had a smile and asked us if we needed anything else. The room was pretty big, all white. I agree with other people that some improvements should be made but we definitely enjoyed our stay. The bed was so comfortable we didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t want to wake up. The pool was awesome. Pina Coladas by the pool were expensive and not too good. I would advise them to make them with Coco Lopez instead of the mix they use. Breakfast was included in the promotion we booked but the price was $25.00 per person. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s expensive but you do get everything you need to not have to eat until late afternoon. My very honest opinion, if you do not want to splurge go to Panaderia Espana on the other side of Ave Isla Verde or driver to Kasalta in Condado, or La Bombonera in Old San Juan and try a Mayorca. So many places to go outside the hotel so people shouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be complaining. As other reviewers mentioned they did charge it to my room bill, and I was charged for it on my card. During check out and after reviewing the bill I told the girl at the front desk that it was included when I booked the room and she gladly and with a smile refunded my credit card with no hassle. I was charged for the towels too and she removed the charges as well. I didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t eat at any of the restaurants in the hotel. A lot of people complained on TA about prices, that is what you should expect in a hotel. My advice is to go outside. Dont go to PR to eat at Ruth Chris when you have tons of great options outside the hotel. Raices in Old San Juan, LAtin Star in Condado. The beach is ok, but you are a drive away to Ocean Park. The fitness center was awesome. I am training to run a marathon and I was able to use the treadmills and do my weights work out during my short vacation so that was nice. The lobby that a lot of people complain on TA was awesome too. I loved the live band Salsa and merengue on Saturday. On Sunday they had like jazz which people pay cover charge anywhere else and you have it for free in the lobby. what else can you ask for??? A casino?! you got it there too. Parking for $16.50 per day. Was the best deal! In and out privileges you never have to worry about parking except Saturday we had to park across the street but is part of the hotel so is included in the 16.50. The resort fee I know is a lot but they do mention it everywhere so people shouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t complain just put it in the budget as part of the room before booking. Every resort in PR has this fee.

I was a little worried about going to the resort right after the storm and also concerned about the negative reviews. I did not find most of the negative reviews to be true ...... and the resort was up and running. From the minute we pulled up to the El San Juan and opened the taxi door we were greeted by the friendly staff. Angelo was one of the first staff members that we met. He was outside and had another member of the staff take us to the front desk. The front desk staff was amazing.. We had a early flight and arrived at the resort at about 10:30 am...they checked us in and we were in our room within 5 minutes. We had the City Vista Room...which looks exactly as it is posted on the web site...the room was white with tropical bright colored decor. I was not crazy about the bathroom...it was small and I thought it should have been nicer for a top rated resort, We did have a problem in the shower when some tiles fell off the wall along with the entire shower bar and shower head that was attached to the wall...my poor son was in the shower when this happened. We reported it to the front desk and it was fixed very quickly..Thank God nothing too serious happened to my son...we were offered another room but decieded to stay. There was also alittle mold in the bathroom....they were having some problems at that time because the hotel was without air for a few days before we arrived..but other than that the room was always kept clean and Isabel our maid was great. she tried to give us all the comforts of home during our stay. The hotel grounds were beautiful and well kept...the pools were great...alot of lounge chairs and sun decks...and if you donot like the they had plenty of shaded areas too. The beach was also nice and clean, although I never found Puerto Rico to have the nicest ocean water. The had a pool bar and other bars outside....a little expensive, but we were not surprised not much different than New York prices. If you wanted lunch when u were at the pool you could also order it..I had a greek salad outside one day and it was great..It was $10.00. This is not an all inclusive resort so there is nothing really going on by the pool or beach...no activities at all. They had a D.J. at the pool on Saturday that played great music....It was very relaxing! We went to a supermarket called Publeos and bought some water, beers, snacks etc...the liquor was cheap in Publeos. We even bought a cheap foam cooler and I also brought a cooler bag from home to bring to the pool/beach. We did not eat in any of the resturants at the resort...just at the cafe where my son had pizza and a burger for lunch and they also had great gelato. We loved the resturants that were in walking distance...: these are to the left when you walk out of the el san juan: Plato's was our favorite (we ate there twice) , Metropol(next to the cock fights) was great too, Don Jose(we had breakfast..it was ok) and Pia Bella(breakfast,,it was ok) to the right of the resort across from the Intercontinenat Hotel Mi Castia....it was greast for breakfast and dinner..we had Ruth Chris at the Intercontinental it was great too. Chillis across the street. Carols, Martin at Kamil and all of the front desk staff were great including the managers. They always answered any questions and gave us great tips about the area. The towel girls were also nice. The concierge staff was great Carlos, Raphael and the rest of the concierge were always helpful too. The lobby was beautiful and the weekened parties in the lobby were amazing...Jimmys BBQ resturant was closed due to damage from the Hurricane and they had the 3 year anniversary party on a Saturday night in the lobby...omg..what a great party...D.J.'s, bands playing and dancing all night..it was amazing!! The Casino was also great alot of slot machines and game tables. We never heard any noise in our rooms from the lobby or disco. ****The only major problem we had was when we booked a tour to the Rain Forest which should have included 3 stops to local beaches and unlimited beers, soda, water , rum punch , pina coladas and a lunch. When my husband and I were on the elevator in the El San Juan we met a man from HIGHLANDER TOURS. He was getting on the elevator from the 6th floor...he said he was a tour guide looking for his guests that were going on a trip that day. Since he was in the resort we thought that he was part of the tour company at the hotel...he gave us the information and everything sounded great so we booked a tour for the next day. It was $75 per person and let me tell you it was a horrible experience. He told us that we could go on a 15-20 minute short tour of the rain forest since my husband had a problem with his leg and that we still could see the rivers and the pool river . After a long ride he took us to some area that I don't even think was the rain forest..some private area...there was another couple in the van..to find out later that they were staying at another hotel. He told us that if we didnot want to take the long tour we could take the short one and then have coffee and pastries.......My son who is a teenager wanted to go on the long trail..donot ask me why but we made him go...the tour guy then tells us to wait where he dropped us..we thought it was going to be a tourist waiting area and go to find out it is someones house up in the woods....he said it was his Aunt's house...the lady was very nice...she didnot speak much english...but we did not pay to sit in some strangers house with roosters and dogs running all over...she had no electric and no water due to the Hurricane...He had the nerve to leave us with an opened bottle of water that was maybe 1/4 filled. The lady offered us fresh coconut water. We waited there for 2 hours in the heat, praying that our son would return safe...which thank god he did. I begged my husband not to fight with this man because we did not know where we were.Before we got there Alex told me that we were about 53 miles away from the resort. It was some experience..we travel alot and never experienced anything like this before. He took us for lunch and then he wanted to get paid....he stopped on the way to pick up a 6 pack of beer....then he took us to Loquillo beach...omg what a slum it was...I donot even think it was that beach..it was dirty...disgusting...a disgrace! No signs saying the name of the beach...no chairs to rent like we read on line....he had his own folding chairs in the back of the van. When we asked him where are the pina coladas, rum punch etc...he said he never told us that (but he said he had rum in the back of his van if we wanted some..lol..crazy)..my husband finally couldnot control himself and had words with him.....my son was looking forward to swimming in that beach and he was even upset about it. Finally when we left that beach he said that he would take us for pina colada's since we must have misunderstood him...which we didnot misunderstand anything...he said he was insulted that my husband told him that we didnot pay to sit by someones house for 2 hours..he said it was his aunts house and it wasnot..the lady told me he was just a friend (I understand some spanish..which he didnot know..he even thought that we whould give him extra money so he could tip her because we stood with her..can u imagine the nerve of this guy!) Well we went to someplace for pina colada's...big deal and it was near a beach..but not a swimming beach..we were just able to look at the view of the beach and we never went near a 3rd beach. It was just a disaster. We advised the resort and made a complaint....we also felt that this man should not have been able to be on the resort property and that he lied and also put us in danger! The hotel manager said that some areas of the resort are opened to the public..which we knew but what was this man doing roaming aroud trying to book tours when the hotel has their own tour company and we only booked the trip because he was on the resort property....security was also contacted and it was the talk of the resort...we were just happy that we returned to the resort safe..his driving was also a horror...most of the time he wasnot even looking at the road...and he also had 2 beers and even stopped for gas on the way back...some tour guide. So please be so careful when booking a tour..thank god we were lucky and returned ok...but some other family may not be as lucky . Well other than our tour experience ...WE ENJOYED OUR STAY AT THE EL SAN JUAN RESORT.... we were even able to get a late check out.....many people from New York also had their flights cancelled due to the Hurricane Irene and were unable to fly back to New York because no flights were available due to the damage in New York ..they said the the resort was very helpful and gave them good rates to stay a few extra days until they were able to return home. My family and I were lucky because our flight was not canceled and we were able to return home as planned. (They also kept us informed on the weather and Hurricane Irene that hit in New York etc) If you plan a vacation to the El San Juan Resort I am sure you will enjoy it...have fun and most of all relax and enjoy spending time with your family or friends!

I actually found an amazing deal on Expedia and I was able to book a room for very reasonably priced. I saw that a hotel employee (Susan Wilkerson) was responding to reviews on trip advisor,so I sent her an e-mail to check in on my reservation and to find out what additional fees,if any, would accrue during my stay. She was very accommodating and quick to respond. We arrived just a few days after Hurricane Irene and we were able to get a room upgrade to the main tower. Oblivious to me,my Expedia reservation included a daily resort credit,so my friend and I put that to good use at the swim up bar lol Our room was pretty nice. We were upgraded from a garden lanais to a vista room. Obviously white furniture doesn't stay white forever,but I wasn't too picky about my room because I was in freaking puerto rico! I did not visit the island to stay cooped up in my room all day! Housekeeping was pretty thorough and my bed was always made and towels always replenished. I never ate at any of the restaurants on site (plenty of others nearby that are much cheaper) and the drinks at the bars can get a little pricey.

The hotel has a great location in a the touristic area of Isla Verde. First, it is located less than 10 minutes from the airport so a Cab RIde cost you about $10. If you want to drive yourself, they have a parking lot that cost around $20 per day and if you want Valet parking if will be $5 extra per day with unlimited in and outs. Rooms has a modern decoration prevailing the white color among the others. Rooms are very comfortable in space and service is great! Lobby area is wonderful and always because of the light effects, you feel at any time that you are in candle lights. The hotel has a huge pool area that includes at least two big pools and one of them has a swim up bar. In addition, the property posees several jacuzzis with water at different temperatures. Tehre is also, a pool that looks like a pond on a river. This area was my favorite!!!!! The beach is a a great sandy one. It is public but the hotel has a separated area with chairs and beach umbrella for hotel guests. It is a wonderful beach with waves, perfect for the whole family. In terms of food, the hotel has several restaurants and bars, all of them are delicious. However, they are really expensive. So if you want an idea, I was speaking with a guy from Las Vegas and he said that the food is more expensive than in California. They have different options: COCO (Modern Caribbean Cuisine with a Rum Bar), BORTHER JIMMYS BBQ (Souther Style Sport Bar), THE PALM RESTAURANTS (A Steak House), YAMATO (considered San Juan's finest Oriental restaurant, featuring a sushi bar and an authentic teppan-yaki table), LA PICCOLA FONTANA (presenting fine Northern Italian cuisine in an exquisitely appointed, elegant ambiance ), LA TERRAZA (casual-elegant dining offered in a breezy tropical setting, overlooking the pool, tropical gardens, and Isla Verde beachfront), AND GALLERIA, PIZZA & TRATTORIA (Pizza, salads, and sandwiches). There is also a Starbucks Coffee in House and room service is available from 6 AM to 11 PM. However, if you are not planning to spend a lot of money on food, there is a lot of options within walking distances in a very safe area. Places such as Chillis, Dennys, Ponderosa and Fast Food Chains such as Burger King, Subway, Churchs Chicken, Kentucky Fried Chicken, etc are just steps awya from the hotel.

There is no one at the desk we see security and ask him if there is someone to check us in. After waiting for 10 minutes we finally get someone to check us in. She give us room 628. We took our kids and want up to the room. To find the room with dirty sheets rice grains & pubic hairs on the sheets and on the bathroom sink. We go back down stairs to complain she gives another room 917. Once again we take the kids, bags and all and go back upstair to find a very dirty bathroom. Now you must understand it's about 4:30am with 2 kids no room back and fourth we are tired and frustated. Front desk apologizes & says she will have the housekeeping supervisor meet us at 917 that they will clean it right away. We go back upstair to find a lady and a man in 917 cleaning the room the Lady apologizes, & apologizes for the conditions of the rooms. I have now decided to video this nightmare to show the GM Monday morning. The man comes out to the hallway and asked me if I was videoing the events & I said yes I want to show your boss what my family & I have gone through. He begins to yell No I'm not at fault here I have nothing to do with this & becomes very threating. My husband tells him to relax and walk away cause we have the right to record our events. The supervior Luz runs out of the room & tells him \"Jose\" you are wrong the guest are right please leave the floor and go downstairs he yells & screams the whole way to the elevator about what he is going to do if we show the GM the video. We couldn't believe what had just happened. Thank god I have it all on VIDEO!!! So we go back down stair to ask for a manager. NO manager on duty. Security doesn't do anything we go outside to call Jetblue to see if they wil change our hotel cause we booked with this family vacation with them. They won't do anything. We come back inside to find security laughing with the housekeeping man Jose. We know we were not safe here but didn't have much of a choose until the morning our boys were tired we figured we just lock ourseleves in the room & we would some how wake up from this offial nightmare. The next moring I go downstair to speak to the Manager Noelia she apologizes tells my they will take care of situation that this man will not bother us nor go into our room. I also call the GM's office & left him a msg to call me. Now please understand we decided to stay because we had other family flying in and check-in to the dump because of us. So Monday I go out I take my drivers license & credit card and go to the supermartket to get some stuff for the beach for my kids when I return I give the car to valet & I forget my ID and Amex I relaize once I get to the room. I run downstairs and you guess it. It's gone I didn't complain at the desk. I called the cops they 6 officers & Sgt. show up they to all the info. & they went to valet. Later that night at 10pm we get a knock at the door. My kids were asleep already My husband was watching t.v & I was already dosing of. It's security that there was a noise complain from our room and we had to go to sleep if not if they had another complain we had to leave. I invited him in and showed him my kids were sleeping that they was no noise coming from our rooom. I asked him where were they when I complained about the party that the guest were having in the room next to us. They didn't stop it. I told him to tell his supervisor to please come up to my room. The same supervior from Saturday morning came up. He began to threaten us like we were lil kids & it was pasted our bed time. Are you kidding me We must be on bunked there is no way this is happening. We told him to leave our room. We decied to pack out belongs & leave the hotel. We checked into the Conrad were I told the manager what happen & he felt that the security i our room was because we call the police. Stay away we didn't listen to the reviews. The hotel is a big party place on the weekends not kid friendly, with parties in the rooms, Music coming from all direction. Rooms are very dirty. Maids are nasty they dont clean the rooms right.

Here is a breakdown from check in to out. Arrival- we were greated by a bellman out front Named Angelo who was extremely friendly. Check in- the front staff was nothing short of welcoming. The lady even walked us over to the bell counter to assure our bags were held while we waited for our room. All the people who complained room wasn't ready...read your check in guidelines before you book. This hotels check in is 4 pm and we were aware of that. Our room was ready by 3 pm. Room- we stayed in ocean lanis and our room was awesome. The furniture is NOT outdated. It is not Miami like but the wood furnishings were gorgeous. You have to have a taste for nice would furnishings to appreciate it. The room was spacious and our sheets were always clean. House keeping- I wish I knew his name because he was great. Our room was always cleaned before we returned even if we were gone an hour. I left jewelry out and nothing was touched. Despite what I had read by other trip advisor reviews. Pools & grounds- the pools were clean and the grounds as well. We never had a problem with wait staff at the pool. Another crappy review I read. Towels - yes you need to give your room to obtain towels but I don't see why everyone complains about that. You are also expected to return them and give your room number again. So what's the problem? Nothing the towel girls were also super friendly. Food- I am a foodie so I was not a fan of the local spots recommended by cab drivers as well as Angelo. The hotel restaurants are expensive but not anymore expensive then eating in Nj or Ny at a fine restaurant. The Palms was fantastic! I wanted to eat there every night. We also ate at the Italian place which also had great food and romantic atmosphere. We ate at Yamato (sushi & japanese) (my husband is Asian) this was the only disappointing restaurant. It's very over priced 18.75 for a special roll and not the best. This was also the only restaurant that included gratuity for a party of two after we tipped over20%. We actually has to complain to get it corrected. We always tip over 20% but a 42 tip on a 116 check is a bit much. Overall staff- no one we encountered was rude. Staff were always saying hello and a handful of times I looked lost they stopped to see if I needed help. I couldn't find a working ice bin and a lady from house keeping came, knocked on our door and even walked me to a working one. They couldn't have been more helpful. Costs- everyone who complained on here didn't read before they booked. Yes they charge if you use the mini bar in your room. BUT guess what,,,it says it right on the mini bar menu sitting on top of it. The Palms is an expensive restaurant regardless of what state your in. It's vacation and if your on a budget don't eat there. Noise & lobby- I stayed in the second building which noise was not a factor. We also spoke with a couple who stayed in the main tower 6 th floor and had no noise complaints. Friday and Saturday the lobby is crowded but a good crowded. It was fun to people watch as everyone does salsa. There are locals but who wouldn't come for great music. If you want a quiet no atmosphere hotel this isn't for you. By no means was the lobby so crowded you couldnt walk. It was entertaining and lively. This hotel was clean, nice staff and a ton to do. Tips for money savers- a ton if places to eat within walking distance with meals under $10.00. You get what you pay for. Mi casitas to right of hotel packed but horrible service. Several places to the left of hotel. Very inexpensive but must like local food. Don Jose, luipis, platos and others. There is also a walgreens to the left of hotel about two blocks.

First you notice the street side of the hotel, not very appealing. Isla Verde Avenue is run down and not very inviting for a tourist. On the beach side it is very nice. The sand is cleaned daily, the use of chase lounges is nice too. The water is warm and calm. Our room was in the main hotel and while clean the shower was in need of repair and had mildew. It would also have been nice to be able to use the frig without a charge. The drinks that were offered in the room were crazy expensive! It was nice to have a Walgreens and a Puebla supermarket within walking distance to get drinks and snacks. Because also at the beach and pool everything was very expensive. You can buy a six pack for less than 1 beer at the pool. The pools were spacious although could use some updating. Also the lounge chairs and covered chairs are in desperate need of replacement, some were torn or broken. The landscaping is very nicely kept. At night we enjoyed the casino and spent time listening to the live entertainment. The music was great and so was the people watching. Puerto Ricans are such great dancers! It was nice not having to leave the hotel for this. The hotel has this 50's art deco vibe going on. Every staff member that we spoke with was very friendly and accomadating. The buses were very easy to use to get to Old San Juan (T5 or 53) there is a stop just down from the hotel and they will get you a taxi if you want.

You are lucky if you find a place to sit down. I heard several people getting into arguments over lounge chairs. Not a way to start out a vacation. -The rooms are old and in need of updating -The food is overpriced and nothing special -The clientele mostly consisted of inconsiderate drunks.

Would have been nice if someone would have mentioned that when we booked our room. The amount of noise we had to deal with all night from the kids in the room next door was unbearable (music and singing at the top of their lungs). We called the front desk several times and only after my husband threatened to call the police, did they finally get the kids to quiet down. We asked to have our room moved, but because of the prom, the hotel was fully booked that night. They all seemed to head out the next morning and it felt like a totally different place after they all left. Much more peaceful and had the pool to ourselves most of the time. Day two...our shower stopped draining. When they came up to take a look, the guy said, \"that's not good\" and turned around and left...they eventually moved us to another room...this time right outside of the elevator, so again a little noisy at night as other guests were coming and going, but still much better than the night before. They did give us a credit for the inconvenience, though neglected to apply the daily food and beverage credit that was part of the Travel Zoo deal until we requested it. They also appear to have double charged our credit card, so we are currently working on sorting that all out. As with most hotels and resorts, the food and alcohol prices were ridiculously expensive.

For me there is no other Isla Verde Hotel that offers so much value for your $. The Lobby almost always offers Live entertainment starting from the early evening. In the lobby there are several bar areas with ample seating. Either at the bar or on a luxurious lounge chair. You can sit back enjoy one of their delicious signature sangrias, mojitos or your cocktail of choice. While there you can enjoy the live music, atmosphere or people watch! The hotel also has a casino and a Club. As a guest in hotel you have free admission, in and out access to lounge and Club Brava. All others pay entrance fee. Around $25-$30. From thurs-sat night the club is the place to be. From Beautiful local people to tourist, when in club Brava you are sure to rub shoulders with the either famous celebs, models, or tourist whom from word of mouth heard about this trendy hot spot. One thing is for sure Dress code is enforced! In the evenings you will need to step it up a notch to Party like a rock star with the sexy people! There are 2 starbucks in hotel, also several Restaurants to choose from. I enjoyed the Palm restaurant several times. The food was incredible. Also the bar @The palm offers happy hour appetizer specials that are half size and price you will find unbelievable. $5 appetizers etc. After eating and enjoying an amazing dinner we became aware of that happy hour special and became regulars at the bar! Lol The rooms are immaculate. All white tile floors. No rugs! The beds are so comfortable that you will have a hard time getting out of them in the morning! ,just knowing the Beautiful ocean is a short walk from your room out the door, will motivate you to wake up and enjoy the tropical weather. Granted, it is a city beach. You should go through out the island to find amazing beaches. The convenience of hotel being situated on the beach is why I make this my favorite Hotel. There are 2 nice pools, several jacuzzy areas. Some very secluded, and yes you are able to use the pool facilities at night! From the moment you step out of your car in hotel entrance, from the Door man, Valet, to the service at the check in desk to the Lobby , pool Bars, the Beach chair guys etc you will experience professional service with a smile! Granted you may once in awhile experience someone whom is not having such a great day. That is no excuse to us, the customers. Though few and far between. My good experiences at This hotel out weigh the bad. When this kind of situation may arise. Always remember you have the option to speak to a supervisor or a manager who will be happy to hear your concern and try to make you leave with a positive experience. The one time that I need to speak with a supervisor , I was never given the run around. Ms. Yvonne Ramos came to me to hear my concerns and offered reasonable, expedited solutions. In my case was a computer glitch in booking room, not the el san juan website! All around the El San Juan Hotel is my favorite for the beautiful grounds, Beach front location, 5 minute cab ride from airport, $15. Also excellent walking distance from 24 hour grocery store called pueblo. There you can purchase anything from food, fruits, liquor bottles, toiletries, etc. also a chilis across the street, a lot of local bar & grills . (my favorite is The Alambique Bar on beach, same block as the Water club hotel. There you can enjoy a delicious Churrasco with mofongo for $17. Also The Third base bar small and right next to El alambique. There you can buy $1.50 can of beer or $2.50 bottle. all day price. Yes, the taxes and resort fees each day add up. Just remember you are getting Location, entertainment, shopping galleria, Beauty salon, restaurants all in this hotel. If you chose to never leave, you have it all at your convenience!

The first happened when a friends fiance called the hotel to order snacks and beers to the room as a surprise. To her surprise her credit card ended up being used around PR. The kicker was she never stepped foot in PR. The hotel's response: she must have lost her card here in PR. Absurd. Another friend after checking in, ended up with thousands being charged to his card in internet purchases. Not exactly sure what happened there, but seems odd that two people in one weekend had the same problem after their cards went through the hotel. When I complained about it, the hotel had its security goons surround us like criminals and said if I want to complain, I should call the police; which is exactly what I did. I was told by the police that if I wanted anyone to do anything, I should fly my friend's fiance down to PR so she can complain. They all made us feel like they were going to arrest us, so we just decided to leave and never go back. Truly, the hotel management could not care less. The other main issues we had were failed promises made by the hotel. Despite promises of upgrades (we had 10 rooms) and promises of a free pool cabana, we were given nothing. Again, when I tried to talk to someone, I was repeatedly told they were in a meeting. They seriously could not care less about customer service at this hotel. Additionally, you must check your bill carefully, as there were numerous bar charges on my room...the only problem is, I do not really drink so I knew they were not mine. They did take those off. The hotel is a ascetically pleasing, but if you are looking for professional hotel service, look elsewhere. Truly one of the least friendly hotels I have stayed at in quite sometime.

To be honest, I was invited to go by a friend, so of course I accepted!! I had usually gone to all inclusives...so this would be quite different. I had read many reviews about this hotel before I left. To be completely honest, alot of them had me quite concerned! I had this vision of it being \"party central\"...noisy, dirty etc. To my surprise, and relief...I can really only say positive things about the actual resort itself. I found it very well maintained, both the actual hotel, and the grounds. The pools were also clean, and nice and warm! The beach was decent, but somehow lacked the appeal of some of the beaches I have been to in Cuba for instance, where the water is a vibrant blue! Here it seemed somewhat murky...but very warm. The staff seemed very accomodating as well. Always a smile! Perhaps the only negatives I can think of...and this is coming from someone who as said earlier, usually goes to the all-inclusives....is the price of the food and drinks in the resort. Definitely worth your while to venture on a 5 minute walk to the nearby Walgreens pharmacy and pick up some cold drinks, snacks etc. We only ate at the hotel once..and that was the breakfast buffet on the very first morning..(as we had no other ideas at that point)....and that was $25 per person. Bit expensive for breakfast every morning...so we soon found a Denny's down the street, which wasn't nearly as fancy..but certainly satisfied us..and at a much cheaper price! There are many steak houses along the main street, as well as other restaurants, and also a plethora of Wendys..Burger King...etc. The Friday and Saturday evenings were very busy with the nightclubs in the lobby...quite entertaining just to sit there and watch all the people streaming in! We were on the 5th floor of the main hotel..and apart from one middle-of-the-night fight in the hallway..we heard nothing else. I would suggest that you go at least the 5th floor and up! There is quite a fun open air restaurant on the top floor of the hotel. In fact during our stay we had the most wicked thunder storms (never experienced tstorms like that before)..one so bad is caused a power outage...when we were dining there! That was almost fun!

It was a FABULOUS HOTEL with GREAT SERVICE. The trip started so great from the get-go. Before we arrived, I emailed Susan Wilkenson, the hotel manager to ask about an early check in becasue our flight arrived at 10:45am. Once we arrived our room was ready for us and we checked-in immediately. Upon arrival we met our housekeeper Mireya and she was in one word - OUTSTANDING! She offered us a cooler and gave us some great tips on the area and fabulous places to eat. She was ALWAYS ready and willing to help out in any way she could. Mireya was great - the best customer service I have seen in a really long time and I have traveled all over the world! Keith at the pool bar was also very good! He gave my fiance helpful hints on where to eat what to do, even where to propose! He even gave us a complimentary drink to congratulate us on our engagement! The hotel was beautiful and kind of pricey but expected. We ate at the italian place in the hotel the night we got engaged and the food was absolutely spectacular! Definitely a must-go. We also ate at Jimmy's BBQ however I would say save your money and go elsewhere. It was $70 for two of us and we didn't even have any alcoholic drinks! It was no better than a Sonny's BBQ here in the states. We did go off-site for quite a few meals - for breakfast, we definitely recommend Mi Casita on Isla Verde. You literally walk outside the hotel to the right and it's a 5 minute walk on your left. We ate there 3 times, very cheap and very delicious. Our dinner at Ruth's Chris was one word - PHENOMENAL!!!! So great, pricey but so well worth it! Stay away from Lupis to the left of the hotel. I thought it was gross but edible. The chili's across the street was good with prompt service. We went to the Yunque (rain forest) which is a must-do, however rent a car for $45 at the hotel and see it yoursef! Its an hour drive but we were so glad we did it. We also went into Old San Juan and were amazed at the history. We took a bus for 75 cents each way or you can take a taxi for $20 each way. If you take the bus take the 53 or T5. Also we ate at a wonderful place called Raisas (not sure of the spelling) and it was wonderful. They offer authetic puerto rican food and it was delicious. Very moderately priced and highly recommended. A little tip, drinking every day at the hotel can be very expensive. There is a supermarket not far from the hotel called the Puebla and they have all the beer and liquor you could want and very cheap. Stock up and put it in a cooler - you can take it down to the beach! Our last day we had a late flight and the hotel was great!! We got a late check out of 1pm and they held our bags while we went and enjoyed the pool and cocktails for a few more hours!! I hope this review helps, I am not sure what everyone is talking about when they say the hotel is loud and service is poor. We had an outstanding stay and experienced excellent service. I will return and tell all my friends about it too! Thanks Susan, Keith, and Mireya for make our stay memeorable.

ROOM Our room was in the Garden Lanias. Nice room, it was very big, double sinks, couch, view of pool. The room could use some ninor upgrades but overall was very nice. Only noise at night was birds chirping. The garden lanais rooms are separate from the main tower (where the nightclub is located). POOL & BEACH The pool is great, nice grounds, comfortable lounge chairs, swim-up bar. On Saturdays they have a DJ who played good music, but the rest of the days there was no music that I we then missed. Drinks at the pool are very expensive, 2 daquiries cost about $27. The do have a good deal on a bucket of a 8 beers (local beer, Medalla light) for $30. Its a good beer and more alcohol than the American beers. Beach is nice with great sand, and the water is nice but not clear like most other caribean islands. The pool and beach are crowded on weekends, but not so during the week. FOOD Overall, drinks and food at this hotel are very expensive. Most days for lunch we just walked across the street to Chiles as its the same lunch food at the Hotel but a lot cheaper. One night we ate at Brother Jimmys which was a complete rip off. We ate at the Italian restaurant, Picolo, which was very good and great service. It is expensive but they do offer a fixed price menu ($30) that is a pretty good deal. We were going to eat at the steakhouse, Palms, but we next store at the Intercontinental they had Ruth Chris which is our favorite steakhouse. A 5 minute walk from the hotel is the supermarket Pueblo if you want to pick up some drinks and snacks. NIGHTLIFE Thursday thur Sunday the nightclub is packed with very good looking people for the single people out there. The lobby is very nice and big with 3 bars and live music, we hung out here for drinks. During the week it's a lot quieter. GAMBLING Every night we gambled at the Intercontinental next store as they had poker for me and cheap limit blackjack for my wife. The poker was $2-$5 no limit and I did very well as most of the players were locals with a lot of money who did not know how to play. The casino also gives you free food when you gamble! ACTIVITIES There are plenty of activities to do but we just mostly wanted to relax. We got massages at the hotel which were great and reasonably priced (cheaper during the week). We did the jetskis which are always fun but I couldnt convince my wife to go ziplining. One day we went to Old San Juan which I thought was a waste. We waited 45 mins for the bus and then another 45 minute ride there, meanwhile the cab ride back took less than 10 mins. The gym is an above avg hotel gym and running on the beach was excellent.

We both get our hands dirty frequently. We spent the first 2 days of our honeymoon in Vieques Island (east of PR) at the W Retreat (freaking awesome!) and had initially planned to say at the El San Juan for the remaining 6 days. We may have been divorced had that happened. If you are looking for a fraternity party scene, the ESJ may be for you. Our shower had spots of mold on the floor and curtains, the bed had an orange stain on the comforter and sand between the sheets. We were woken up at 3-4am by yelling and cursing (all perfectly audible) and every slammed door rattled our own room door, due in large part to the paper-thin walls. The shower's water never surpassed 85 degrees. The El Yunque hiking tour we booked and paid $140 for the day we arrived, somehow happened to be full the next morning, something we found out as we waited an hour outside the hotel lobby. This led to mass confusion with the money we paid and the consolation trip that was thrown together for us afterward (in which we did not get the tour we had paid for). The man who booked our tour, Ricky, was not at the hotel the morning we were scheduled to leave, so the left foot didn't know what the right was doing. Which brings us to the customer service...the girl (17/18?) we explained our tour mishap to (not Ricky) had no care whatsoever about our situation, while the hotel manager, Marangeli, had trouble looking up from her computer as we explained in detail what had happened over the 24 hours of our stay. She even basically told us that some of the tour companies the ESJ deals with are people she cannot vouch for. She promised to \"take care\" of us and upgrade us to a Lanais suite, but having seen the ESJ beach (trash, beer bottles, minimal swimming area due to excess ropes/buoys for jet-skis), we decided to leave after 2 nights. We never received a follow-up call. We can certainly second the comments about a complete facelift being needed and the noise (if I was in college, I'd have been fine with all of it). The area the hotel is located in is very downtrodden, with broken bottles and fast food restaurants galore lining the main street.

Ultimately, we were very disappointed with the hotel and its facilities. Hotel staff was OK, but scarce at certain times of the day. Not having been to Puerto Rico in years, we found the hotel offered very little information on activities for vacationers. No brochures. No maps. No mention of the island's history or attractions. Taxi fares inconsistent. Ask before you go. Carry cash...not all cabs take credit cards. VERY PRICEY for hotel rooms, meals, drinks and amenities. Expect to spend a lot. Quality of food wasn't great at the hotel restaurants either...we were actually served a plate of potato chips with a cup of salsa for \"nachos\" at a poolside bar and grill and got charged for it! Not all restaurants/pool bars are open simultaneously during the day. Hotel has a popular disco that is a major attraction to the locals which made many lobby/pool areas in the evening crowded and noisy very late into the evening. Security is questionable as locals have access to the hotel pool areas off the beach. One woman had her purse/beach bag stolen while she was swimming in the pool. Overall, the hotel is in dire need of a facelift although we were told they had recently renovated their rooms. I observed several rooms during my stay...dated furniture and decor once outside the main lobby. Torn mismatched drapes and old, beat up furniture. Our room air conditioning was almost nonexistent after first day. Even a fresh coat of paint or steam cleaning would probably help one's overall impression. Going to the beach or outside pool areas? Be sure to pack plenty of bug juice. The no-see-ums are carnivorous! Poolside towel desk does provide a spray can of OFF to use while you're standing there...so I recommend bringing your own insect repellant. You'll need it!

And why aren't you calling their room to tell them instead of supposedly coming up here and not hearing anything, they did no come up they would have heard it coming up the elevator.

We did heard the phone ringing before we left in the next room and someone yelling \"They want us to quite down!!\" So we knew that another couple or family were in for a long week and a waste of their vacation and money.
