{"Reviews": [{"Content": "Terrible place! We and another couple stayed here in January and I can say without a doubt it was the worst hotel in which we have ever stayed in Europe. The unfriendly desk clerk sent us through a bad neighborhood to a restaurant we couldn't find. A block from the hotel we watched either an arrest by plain clothes officers or a robbery, we're not sure which. Hotel itself was shabby and dingy.", "Date": "Dec 23, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR866074298", "Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "2", "Check in / front desk": "1", "Overall": "1", "Value": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "1"}, "Author": "Medstrike"}, {"Content": "Our World Cup base This hotel was a base for a friend and I when we visited Germany for the World Cup.The location is both a plus and a minus. The good thing is that it is dead easy to find, a two minute walk from the main train station. And from there most of the middle of Frankfurt is in easy walking distance, or you can hop on a tram or the underground right outside. The bad news when we stayed there was it is right next to an irsh bar open into the early hours ... it was packed during the World Cup but I guess it's fairly quiet at all other times. It's also on the edge, although not in the middle of, the Frankfurt red light district so it's not the most desirable destination at night.Having said all that, we stayed at the front of the hotel and when the windows were shut you couldn't hear a thing from the streets below.The reception staff were very friendly and helpful, the rooms clean and the breakfast passable.We found it a bit pricey for what it was, although the World Cup was on so there were'nt too many bargains about. All in all a reasonable base for exploring the city which has a surprising amount to offer.", "Date": "Jul 17, 2006", "ReviewID": "UR339560923", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "4", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member"}, {"Content": "Necessary, nice enough We stayed at the Terminus for one night because we were flying out from Frankfurt airport the following day (Is there another reason for a tourist to stay in Frankfurt more than once??), and we wanted to be close to the main railway station.Our room was spacious, standard business hotel-style, with a good firm bed and clean, and large-ish bathroom - for EURO 70. The room faced the street, but was not too noisy. I noticed there were more rooms tacked on behind the main building that looked smaller - so I would recommend asking to see your room before you commit yourself. There are many hotels within a few blocks of the station if you don't like what you see.Both the receptionists we met were friendly and helpful - and check-out was midday, which was great for us as our flight wasn't until late afternoon. There was a decent breakfast, and a free internet terminal for guests.One other point ... We paid EURO 3 at the tourism office at the station to book us a room. By the time we walked to the hotel (only three minutes), the booking form had not arrived so we booked in directly with the receptionist, and the EURO 3 was a waste.", "Date": "Mar 7, 2005", "ReviewID": "UR703816431", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "3", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "tongi"}, {"Content": "Reasonable hotel The hotel is excellently placed by the station with only an easy walk the the main sights.
