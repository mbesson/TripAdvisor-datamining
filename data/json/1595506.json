It was small and claustrophobic. I had to walk sideways between the bed and the wall to get to the other side of the room (I'm a size 8 - 10). We could hear the lift from our room, and we were over the other side of the hotel. The toilet did not flush properly. We felt very unsafe and did not sleep well at all. We came home after the first night there. As you can see from our photos - we just couldn't stay there. We asked to upgrade (as the website showed some nicer rooms). The member of staff told us we were in their 'best set of rooms'. If we were in their best set of rooms, I wander what their worst set of rooms was like! Breakfast was awful. There were a handful of croissants and danishes - these were stale. We had saucers for plates.There was no meats or cereal as you might expect from a continental breakfast, which is what we were advised we were getting.

Then we looked at the reviews on here and was dreading it, but the hotel was not that bad. It doesn't deserve the bad reviews, but I'll try and be as honest as possible. The rate was \u00a339 for a non-refundable double room. This ended up being a double room with twin beds pushed together. It actually worked out better because we wanted a twin room but it cost more. The hotel is very close to everything, a 10 minute walk to the pantheon, 25 min walk to the Vatican, 15 minute walk to the Colosseum etc. There are also several buses that go past but we only used them once. The entrance to the hotel is down a narrow corridor lodged inbetween two caf\u00e9s which leads to a small reception area. The reception is absolutely nothing like the pictures on the website, but that doesn't matter! you don't hang around in the reception! We got a room on the second floor. The corridors have loads of modern art hanging up. It is quite unusual, a bit weird (because it is a hotel) but interesting too. There were some seats on the second floor which I saw people sitting and using their laptops (presumably to get better wi-fi or in my case signal for my phone). The room was small but adequate. The 'double' bed was acually 2 twin beds. There was a small stain on the duvet but it was under the cover thing and I didn't actually notice it for a couple of days so it didn't bother me really. We also had a blanket because it was freezing when we were there. The room itself though was actually really stuffy. It was good when we were there because it was cold but I dread to think what it would be like in the summer. I think there was air-con but I didn't really have a look. The bathroom was small but fine. The shower was a half-bath thing. I am not sure how you would actually use it but we just used the shower. It did make the floor wet, but just don't put your clothes on the floor! my friends had a proper shower with a curtain. The room didn't smell until the last night. The last night had an awful smell in the bathroom, and I thought I would air it out but this made the entire room smell. But it was the last night so it wasn't that big a deal. The paint on the wall was a bit scuffed, but nothing a lick of paint wouldn't fix. The cleaner cleaned our room, made the bed, emptied the bin and cleaned the bathroom everyday so the service wasn't terrible. We didn't have to ask for anything else. However when my friends room key stopped working she just told her room number to the receptionist and she changed it, without checking! A man kept lurking outside their room too and rung their phone. So that was a bit worrying, but nothing happened, so it could have been nothing.

Directly across from the huge white Victor Emmanual and Unknown Soldier monument built by Mussolini.

We had room 308-quiet, adequate-I would ask for it again-especially after seeing the earlier Trip Advisor reviews Truly,the room needs a major re-hab, but was very clean-queen size bed very comfortable, room usual european size, but room for luggage and to hang clothes and a small desk and seat-2 night tables , flat screen tv-we didn't use it- Charming window overlooks the piazza and a patch of green lawn beside the V-E. monument. We kept it open to catch the night breeze, but noise woke us around 4 A.M. with street sweepers, etc.-closed it and slept soundly until 8 both days. Can't comment on air-conditioning as it was off for the season. Maid service is very good-fresh,large bath towels each day-linens done up freshly each morning(we stayed 2 days) The shower is quite tricky in that you have to climb in over the edge like getting into a tub but is only a shower of maybe 32-34 inches diameter-really needs a wall bar for balance getting in and out and a longer shower curtain to catch run-off. Bathroom is tiny(!) and the ceiling over the shower needs to be patched and re-painted- There was plenty of hot water and good pressure. We paid $250/nite for the room- was very quiet, near elevator and we did not need to use cabs or any transportation other than walking-so saved on those expenses-besides we were in the heart of one of the world's major cities...so I guess that was a good rate for a 3 star hotel. Elevator was safe, roomy and fast. Breakfast was a typical continental-good tasting, hot American coffee, tea, juices and fresh rolls. Plenty of breakfast and lunch areas all around the hotel, so not a problem getting a large breakfast if you wanted one. The staff was professional and on duty 24-7. The lobby is as expected for older, in-town hotel, but not as pictured. Very tiny, actually-but has all you want-maps, etc so to sum up- amazing location; old hotel, needs to be up-dated; very clean, comfortable bed; basic but nice self-serve breakfast -good coffee! decor - out-sized paintings- mostly portraits- hung everywhere-would have preferred relaxing scenes of Italy or the city surround, but to each his own(the paintings are pictured in the write-up on-line so can't say we weren't warned!!!) each floor has a lounge-very basic wi-fi only on 2nd floor near lounge bring a converter for your phones, computer,etc. Not sure this hotel deserves a 3 star rating, but location and cleanliness do take the sting out", "Date": "November 15, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Mali Losinj, Croatia", "Title": "\u201cMore than value for money!\u201d", "Author": "magda m", "ReviewID": "UR119981801", "Content": "We stayed in this hotel for 3 days, booked a double room for a really nice price.

On arrival at midday was told room not ready until 2pm and there was no safe holding place for our cases in the meantime and they were to be left in the entrance lobby to one side, and we could either sit with them or trust they'd be ok there unattended. Once we returned at 2pm and were shown our room we were shocked at the size of it, we weren't expecting anything massive but it was tiny with the smallest wetroom serving as a bathroom. It was clean enough but clearly had only been tidied and not properly cleaned before our stay, the floor was sticky and dirty and the walls were also dirty. our room was right next to a public toilet (mainly used by staff from the office right on the other side of our room) and the walls were paper thin and could hear the staff's very loud conversations and the phone constantly ringing. We then attempted to use the safe to find we needed to pay a 10euro deposit for, though when we tried were told very rudely by the receptionist that the key had been lost and there wasnt one and we were to leave our money in our room or carry it with us. we then saidwe wanted to be moved to a room with a safe and not next to an office and often used toilet to be told every room was now occupied (though this was 20mins after we had just been able to check in) and we were to come back tomorrow for a room change. so we went out for the day and evening and returned for an early night. once we'd settled into bed we soon realised how thin the walls were and were kept awake by constant loud use of the toilet by seemingly several people at once having extremely loud conversations. we soon grasped that this toilet had a door leading onto an outside balcony which was being used for smoking on ( and the balcony ran right under our window so anyone could come to the window and look in/climb in if the window was left open, which it had to be as the aircon was also not working!) by this point after been up very early for the flight and out all day a member of staff in the office right next to us on the other side decided to put their stereo on full volume and treated us to some lady gaga at 11 of a night! we had to get out of bed go round the corner and tell them to turn it down. had the worst nights sleep ever thanks to constant talking/banging/shouting going on in the toilet next door and the hardest bed ive ever slept on with only one pillow each. The next morning went to the reception to see which room we were been moved to only to be told we now weren't been moved and had to stay where we were. by this point was extremely angry and insisted on speaking to a manager, who finally agreed to move us but told us it was to a room with no window as such, just one skylight, which was (if possible) even smaller! And also this room also didnt have a safe with a key and the fridge wasnt working. but this we were told was our only other option. we took this room if only to guarantee some form of a quiet nights sleep that night. the room again was suitably clean and tidy but not amazingly so. Ive stayed in many hotels and am well aware that for a central location, which it really is, then you have to make some concessions. and for a 3 star hotel was adaquete. but the main thing that ruined this hotel for me was the first room position (if going to stay DO NOT stay in room 238) and the appalling attitude from the staff. everything seemed to exasperate them and they were extremely rude when speaking to you, didnt want to help in any form and any concerns fell on deaf ears. ( and throughout our stay we noticed a few times customers attempting to raise concerns unsuccessfully to the staff) a real shame as the location couldnt be better, you really are in the heart of Rome and would be an amazing place to stay if the staff actually cared about their customers stay.

My partner and I have traveled quite a bit and had our share of pretty bad and good hotel rooms. This is definitely not a 4-5 star hotel, but doesn't claim to be one. The hotel is right in front of the hustle and bustle of Piazza Venezia and within spitting distance of The VIttoriano. We took a cab from FCO and cost us about 60 Euros. From the hotel, everything is within walking distance. The Trevi Fountain is a 5 minute walk, as well as the Roman Forum and 10 minutes to the Colosseum and Piazza Navona and Pantheon. Bus line 64 stops right in front of the hotel to go to the Vatican and the Termini. The bus ride to the vatican was about 10 minutes without traffic. The lobby is somewhat simple and small with just one desk. Not the usual long counters at other big hotels. The hotel lobby and hallways are well lit and beautifully decorated with pop art. The elevator was all glass and very unique. The room we stayed at 204 was simple yet functional. It's not big, but not small either. We stayed at smaller hotels in Tokyo so room size was not an issue for us. Room and bathroom was clean. Sheets were clean as well. High ceilings actually made the room look bigger. It had a huge window overlooking the Piazza which we liked. If you're sensitive to outside noise, then you should probably get some earplugs as it can get loud during the daytime. The noise didn't bother us though. The bed was firm but comfortable. There was a small flat screen TV in the room but we didn't find any English channels, only Italian. The bathtub/shower does not have shower curtains, so you would have to sit on the tub if you want to shower to avoid water getting on the floor. It was fine with us although this might be an issue with tall people. The toilet was pretty narrow so this might be an issue with wider folks. There is a built in semi-bidet on the toilet bowl which was nice. Also, the towels are not the usual plush towels but they did the job. Amenities were good, they gave us shampoo, soap, etc. There is a room safe as well and a small fridge. We didn't bother with the mini bar because the drinks were 3.50 Euros each. The walls in the room I can tell were kind of thin as we could hear people talking outside the room, but that didn't bother us. WIFI signal was pretty spotty inside the room, but was very strong in the hallways. I was able to facetime my family back home using my iphone with very little lag. They have chairs and tables right outside the room. Don't forget to leave the maid 2 Euros if you want your room made up. Breakfast was not included with our reservation, but we usually leave the hotel before 7AM anyway to beat the crowd at the tourist attractions so we always ate outside. There's also a DESPAR supermarket 5 minutes away from the hotel where we bought food and drinks. We did try the hotel breakfast for 5 Euros a person. The breakfast was simple yet satisfying. It was just a usual continental breakfast and consisted of coffee/tea/juice and Italian pastries. I thought it was a good deal for 5 Euros since you can easily spend almost 4 Euros for a cup of coffee outside. Overall, I really liked this hotel. It's basic but it really did the job for us and the location cannot be beat!

Right in front of the Piazza Venezia, central to everything. That's the great part - nothing else is. The hotel is offbeat and bizarre. I arrived hours before my room was ready, so I asked them to hold on to my luggage - they showed me the \"closet\" to put it in - small and mostly packed with other suitcases. But there was no lock on the door, and in these cramped close quarters (stairway to upstairs goes right by the closet) anybody could grab anything! As I put my stuff in, the clerk eyed my netbook case and asked if there was a laptop in there - when I said yes, she said she'd better keep an eye on it herself and put it behind the hotel desk - just a bit unsettling and during the few hours I walked around waiting for my room, believe me I thought about it. It was there when I got back, but my room was the tiniest I have ever stayed in - not counting the bathroom (which was \"basic\" but OK), it was roughly 10 ft x 7 ft. The bed was positioned along the side wall (10 ft wall) otherwise you would have to squeeze to get past the bed. Counted in that 10 feet at one end, is the rod that is suspended between 2 boards to hang your clothes on (no doors covering it). The (one) window was high up and you have to step up a foot or more to see out. TV was likewise tiny - fridge was warmish - lucky only bottles are in there, because perishibles would not make it thru the night. Furniture was like Salvation Army (no offense meant). The lobby help (looked like all in 20's) was \"detached\" - unconcerned no matter what the issue was - you got the feeling that if you brought up a problem you were being a bit pesky. They were like a clique and seemed to be having a good time with each other (and avoided eye contact with the pesky guests as much as possible)- strangely none of them were Italian, even the floorsweeper (no carpet in lobby) - they all spoke another foreign language to each other, and I wondered how this all came about... The lobby has rock and roll \"art' on the walls - I honestly could not tell if it was intentional or if someone had snuck in and scrawled graffiti all over and pasted up some homemade posters someone had thrown away- plus a picture of a semi-undressed dude. I later asked for an adjustment in my bill due to an air conditioning malfunction, and the answer was \"you pre-paid (internet) so there's nothing we can do here - write a letter to the manager\". I asked where he was - \"Not here\". I later wrote a letter - no response. At 1 AM one morning I could hear talking outside my room, (3rd floor) and it kept up for 15 munutes or more, so I got up and took a peek out (no peep holes in doors) to see what jerks would hang around the hallways at that hour - someone had put a small table in the narrow hall with 2 chairs and there was a guy talking on his cell phone! Well you get the picture - if you just want a bed in a great location for low cost, can sleep like a rock , and don't care about your offbeat cramped surroundings, this is fine (but so is a hostel and a lot friendlier). But if you or your spouse/partner/friend like a decent room, amenities, quiet accomodations, normal people running the hotel and respectability, don't stay here!

The receptionist was one of the rudest and most uncooperative out of all the hotels I have stayed in. This coming from a born and raised New Yorker I have met many rude people in my time and have came across many people who do not do their job properly and she was the top of the list. On arrival, we were conversing with her in Italian and she was very put off by questions we asked and acted like she did not want to be there. The staff told us our room was on the third floor and that it was not the room that we had booked but would be able to change rooms the next morning. We arrive in a room that we did not want to find a small window and a bathroom that was unusable. Please explain to me how you are supposed to get ready when the shower floods the bathroom and when you turn on the sink water comes spilling out the bottom of the base ? Let's just say our bathroom was flooded within one use of the sink or shower. We sucked it up and spent the night in that room. The next morning we were able to switch rooms according to the staff. When I called reception at 11am explaining what was told to me the day before I was told this was impossible and no rooms are open. I felt like something was not right so went down and spoke with her in whom she claimed she did not understand (which she did since we explained in English and Italian). We went out for the day and came back and demanded a room change to what we booked (a room with 2 beds) she said nothing is open then magically pulled a key out for a new room. We proceed to the new room and holy crap it was worse than the first room. The carpet was filthy and the room was located on the 4th floor with little light and a musty smell. We figured to give this new room a shot and spent the night in the room to find the bathroom door doesn't shut and the A/C is broken. It is August in Rome and anyone who has been knows it is HOT as HELL! Sleep was minimal and it was unbearable in the room. The next day I found myself sick with no voice and 2 bloody noses (which i have never had in my lifetime) The room was so stuffy and with no air. We went downstairs and complained and the staff informed us there was nothing they can do and there are no rooms. I was so upset and did not understand how an entire hotel in which we never saw a soul was full. We were forced to stay in the unbearable heat for another 2 nights until we checked out. It was miserable and I would not recommend this hotel to anyone. I don\u2019t think it is worth even the 3 stars that it is given. This was the last stop on my 2 week backpacking trip around Europe and I must say Hostels are cleaner, have friendlier staff and A/C that works. I would recommend staying in a hostel over this hotel with its rude staff and dirty floors and small windows.

We have just arrived home after staying at this hotel. We arrived and were not even greeted by the rudest receptionist I have ever met. I am 27 - I have met a lot of rude people in my life but she was definitely in the top ten. She barely grunted when I said we had a reservation and only spoke to ask for our passports and then tell us the room number. (She could speak English as we unfortunately had to converse with her for longer later on). We were given the most dog awful room on the 4th floor. If you are given a 4th floor room - refuse it straight away - they are shocking. Our 1st room had no air conditioning and no window - it was 40 degrees outside! No window and was in a loft - my boyfriend couldn't stand in the vast majority of the room. The bathroom was disgusting. We paid \u00a3360 for 5 nights while this is good for Rome this was still a fair amount and after cheaper and nicer hotel rooms the previous nights of our holiday in Venice and Naples this room made me want to cry. We went back downstairs with all of our luggage to complain and was told that this was the only double room in the hotel. The rooms of the 3rd floor were out of action as there was a problem with the AC. We could stay in this room or in two single rooms until the next night when they would have a double free. We had booked a double room with AC at least a month prior to going. I said I wasn't having that room and would rather stay in the singles. We were then given a triple room again on the 4th floor. Again no AC and the window in the room was a sky light covered with about 10 years worth of moss. We went back down the stairs again with all of our luggage and complained. This time we were given a double room on the 2nd floor with AC (and a window). Why were we told that there wasn't any double rooms available with AC when there was?! We were obviously really annoyed - the receptionist never apologised and was clearly inconvenienced with our complaints. Other then the problems on the 1st day, the hotel was great. The other hotel staff were pleasant. The room was very nice and clean. The bathroom is small but perfectly adequate. The location is awesome - you can walk every where and is a few mins from the Collesium, Forum, Trevi Fountain etc. Be warned, the walls are super thin and we were woken every night by noise next door and in the hallway. The cleaners also start work extremely early and are banging away in the hallway from about 7 am onwards - no chance of a lie in here. The phone in the corridor also seemed to ring every 3 mins from 7am onwards and was insanely loud.

This hotel had a multitude of things that were wrong with it.

To the right is lively Campo de Fiori, Piazza Navona and the Vatican. Directly behind the hotel you will find the Trevi Fountain and Spanish Steps. Awesome! Right next door to the hotel is an amazing gelateria where I ate gelato every single day. For 2,50 euro you get two different gelato flavors and they decorate your cone with cute waffle pieces and candy. Yum! Definitely try it. As for the hotel itself, we really enjoyed it. Our room was on the top level and was surrounded by cute breakfast tables where guests would eat in the morning. The room was more modern and the beds were VERY comfortable. The bathroom was also very nice, however no shower curtains (as was the case throughout all of Europe). With regard to cleanliness, the room was very clean. I would definitely recommend this hotel. One thing I did not like was that air conditioning was controlled by the receptionist. When turned on, our room would be freezing. When off, we would sweat as Rome is very hot in the summer. The hotel staff, however, were sketch. Upon our arrival, we were greeted by a kind young woman who was very helpful and pointed out several locations on a map for us to visit. Throughout the remainder of our stay, the staff seemed to get annoyed with our questions. When we requested a cab back to the airport in advance, we were told no cabs would be available at that time (5pm) and we had to pay extra for a private driver. Our next destination was to the Greek Islands and we had asked the receptionist to call our hotel for us in Greece as our room phone was broken. She refused and quickly became very annoyed with us. Other than her attitude, our experience at this hotel was phenomenal. LASTLY - DO visit the restaurant called La Carbonara. Do not confuse this restaurant with the touristy La Carbonara located in Campo de Fiori. The restaurant I am referring to is located in a very non-touristy area off of a quiet street in Monti.

I found and booked this hotel after price comparing and reading reviews on here and elsewhere. The hotel is/was fairly difficult to find the first time. It's tucked between a couple cafes and you can walk right past it very easily... as we did the first time. The hotel is pretty much bare bones and the photos on its website are NOT representative of what the rooms truly look like. There is a reception desk, elevator, room with a TEENY, TINY bathroom and shower (more about this later) and bed so close to the wall that my husband had to walk sideways to get from his side of the bed over to the bathroom, and that's about it. But really, when you're in Rome, you're not really going to spend all that much time in your room, so it was okay for us. The bathroom, in particular, the shower. Oh my gosh. For the Americans out there, think of your bathtub at home... long and fairly wide. Now, think of splitting that into thirds lengthwise and one of those thirds is the shower at this hotel. There's no shower curtain, and you can't hang the shower head up, lest get water all over the vanity, so you'd literally have to squat down, get yourself wet, stand up and soap up, and squat back down to rinse off. I have to say, it was the worst shower I've ever taken, and I had to do it three days in a row. And if you wanted to take a bath (say, after a marathon), there was no way for it to happen... the tub is just way, way too short. No thanks!! The pros of the hotel are of course its location. You're so close to a lot of the sites and it's really in a prime place. If you're looking for a hotel to just chill in your room (and why would you do this in Rome?!), this hotel is not for you.

After reading all the reviews here before we left, we were a bit hesitant, weary and was well prepared to move to another hotel if we found it really bad. But the hotel WAS NOT as bad as other reviewers had made it to be. The entrance to the hotel is small and can easily be missed. HOWEVER, after walking around Rome, we found that the entrance is typical to most 3-4 star hotels. The location of the hotel is excellent!!!! It is about 5 minutes to the Colosseum, Palentine Hill, Trevi Fountain and maybe 10 minutes to the Spanish Steps (just depending on how fast you walk, how often you stop to admire the endless historical buildings, go to shops, etc). It is also right opposite the Roma Capitoloni (Museum - where it is nice to watch the sunset in the evening overlooking the Colosseum and Palatine Hill). Pantheon and Piazza Navona are also about 5 minutes walk away. Because the hotel is very well located, we did not need to buy any bus tickets. The only time we bought bus tickets was when we went to the Vatican and to the Termini station, only about 5 minutes bus ride. You can walk to the Vatican if you like walking and probably take 20 minutes (the 33 degrees heat prevented us from doing this). Bus stop is right outside the hotel so no need to walk far away. We loved the location of this hotel, because it gave us a chance to do all the sightseeing during the day and we were able to go back to the hotel, have a nap and freshen up for the evening. It is located in an area that never sleeps. It was always busy, just like being located in the middle of Piccadilly Circus or Leicester Square in London. We did not have a problem with the noise as the windows were double glazed so could hardly hear anything inside and had no reason to open it to get air. Bonus point of the location is that it is next to an Irish pub, Scholars Lounge! When we got to the hotel, we were welcomed by very courteous staff. We were given a welcome pack with maps and guides. We are from Asian background and we did not experience any racism. We were initially offered room 420 but having read all the bad reviews about the room before we left, we declined. They asked us to have a look and see how we feel about it and so we did...Having read all the bad reviews here about the room, we were expecting a really grotty, horrible room. When we got to the room, we were very surprised. The room WAS not as bad. The room is in the attic, very spacious, have a double bed and a single bed, big bathroom with bath and shower. The ONLY problem we saw with the room was there was no windows and if you are claustrophobic like me then the room may not be for you. We were then offered room 314. Having been given the room, we were still nervous of what the room was going to be like. But when we got there, we were welcomed with a room that was well air conditioned, double bed, flat screen tv, hangers were available to hang our clothes, mini bar, safe and abundance of hot water. The only problem we had with the room was that the shower curtain was a bit short, so everytime we had a shower, the bathroom floor was always wet. But the room was cleaned everyday and fresh towels were provided everyday. We would definitely be staying with this hotel again in the future as they are currently building a Metro right opposite the Hotel, making it a very well connected hotel in the future.", "Date": "August 31, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "2", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Middlesex", "Title": "\u201cThere are Youth Hostels in the UK that offer better accomodation\u201d", "Author": "Travellerinseat17", "ReviewID": "UR18029341", "Content": "Having cast the requisite coins into the Trevi fountain, I hope that one day I shall return to Rome. It is a lovely and historic city. However, one place to which I shall definitely NOT be returning is the Hotel Piazza Venezia. On arrival the reception area was pleasant and the staff helpful and courteous. This therefore did nothing to prepare our party for what was to greet us on the fourth floor. As we stepped from the elevator we were hit by a wall of hot air; if we had wondered where all the heat had gone from the ground floor now we knew. The rooms were no better, and there is nothing that one can do about it, other than complain, since the air conditioning is controlled centrally. An exception is room 420 where it is controlled by what looks like a mobile phone stuck to the wall behind the lift shaft. Unfortunately we were not told about this on arrival and I spent the first night being kept awake by the heat and by what proved to be an air conditioning fan that sounded as if it were about to tear itself apart at any moment. Only by the third evening had the temperature in our rooms come down to a level at which it was worth getting into bed rather than lying on top of it. The corridor outside remained like an oven. Our rooms were dark. In most the only outside light came from a small fanlight in the sloping roof. Yes, this was a loft or attic extension. In my room the bedside lights did not work and a coil of wire protruding from the bathroom wall did not improve my confidence in the electrics. My room had no wardrobe but I was lucky and had a clothes rail below which there was a drawer. A collegue had no such luxury and lived out of a suitcase for the duration of our stay. On the first morning we found that there was no water with which to have a wash or to flush the WC. Whilst this was not the hotel's fault but due to on-going works along the road, there was no warning, and it does seem that there is a risk of a recurrence until the works are completed. Thanks to Trenitalia I still had a refreshing towel. I never thought that I would be so grateful for one. Much is made of the hotel's central position. However this is something of a red herring. Rome is such an easy city to get around. A series of well planned strolls will take in most of the sights and four euros will buy you unlimited travel for the day on the busses, even if they are rather crowded. Also, the Piazza Venezia never sleeps, so if you can open a window neither will you. The hotel offers no food. Breakfast can be provided at one of the cafes next door. However, thanks to the central position a coffee and glass of orange juice can cost you eight euros if you want to sit down. The final straw came when one of our party was charged an extra fifty euros on departure. The hotel maintained that his booking had been made separately and at a different rate. We had the confirmation of booking in writing to prove otherwise, but the hotel would have none of it and when you have a flight to catch you do not have time to argue. We were charged between 139 and 169 euros per night which was exorbitant for the standard of accomodation provided. I cannot imagine how this hotel was ever awarded three stars. Some of the staff perhaps deserve some credit for effort. However there are Youth Hostels in the UK that offer better accomodation and unless you have strong masochistic tendancies or an odd sense of humour this hotel is one to avoid.", "Date": "July 19, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "3", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "3", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Los Angeles", "Title": "\u201cgood location, but that's it\u201d", "Author": "kim7821", "ReviewID": "UR17911592", "Content": "My stay at the hotel piazza venezia in Rome from June 30th till July 3rd was pleasant except for one major detail.

We knew we were on the right street as we were directly opposite the giant white building/memorial (Italians call it the wedding cake...you'll see why) on Piazza Venezia. However, having walked up and down the street three times we still couldn't find the hotel and started to get a bit worried. I used my very limited Italian to ask a policeman, who told me we were definitely on the right street but he had never heard of the hotel...more worry, We did eventually find it...right next to the bus stop. There was a sign, but it was just a very tiny brass plaque beside the doorway. This is my ONLY criticism of this hotel, something which could be easily rectified with an awning or larger sign over the doorway. We were met by a very polite and helpful concierge who spoke perfect English. He even took the time to point out on a map exactly where the hotel was in relation to all the main tourist attractions and sights. The entrance hall was light and clean and seemed to have been recently redecorated. Our room was on the third floor (there is a lift) and had been recently renovated. It wasn't overly large, but was certainly comfortable enough to use as a base while exploring Rome. The room and bathroom were very clean, with plenty of fresh towels and all the usual complimentary toiletries. There were only Italian TV channels, but we didn't want to waste time watching TV, so that didn't bother us. The location is unbeatable, we didn't walk for more than about 15 minutes to any of the main sights (with the exception of the Vatican, which was a 10 minute bus ride from right outside the hotel). We didn't need to use the metro at all. We didn't experience any of the problems with building work/noise that other travellers have reported - the only evidence we saw was some flat-pack furniture waiting to be put together in one of the hallways (this was well out of the way though, so didn't pose an inconvenience). Our room faced out onto a side street, so the street noise was reduced but not removed - as another reviewer has pointed out, this is the price you pay for such a central location. However, with the window closed this didn't keep us awake at night. Breakfast is not available at the hotel, but it is next door to two cafes, so that really wasn't a problem! In the larger cafe (on the right if you are facing the hotel) there is also a small shop where you can buy cigarettes, sweets and bus/metro tickets. Overall we were very happy with our stay, and would definitely use this hotel again.

Of all the hotels that we stayed at while we were in Italy, the staff at Piazza Venezia truly went above and beyond the rest. They are truly multi-lingual. We heard one concierge coverse fluently in about four different languages. They were able to recommend restaurants where the locals eat, they taught us how to use the public transportation system, and when we had trouble with our phone card, one of them even offered to let us use his personal cell phone. When it became clear in the last minute that we needed to stay an extra night, the hotel did not have a room for us. However, one of the concierges made phone calls for us and found us a room at another hotel. He even went as far as bargaining the price down for us. The room we stayed in was clean, though the floor needed shampooing. The bathroom had been newly renovated and sparkled. There was a charming wood framed window in the bathroom to let in natural light and fresh air. Our room faced a side street, but we could still hear some street noise - it is the price you pay for the central Roman location. There's nothing anybody can do about it except to bring earplugs.

Whether this was true or not, we will never know....but it wasn't the best start and we felt very let down; it tarnished our stay at the hotel for the rest of our stay.

Rooms had maid service everyday with clean towels and beds made (see below). Bad points - advertised as having air con' - it didn't work for the entire duration of our stay which was in Sept - goodness knows what it must be like when the weather is hotter. Despite attempts for staff to get it working, it never did ,apparently, said one of the reception staff, if one half of the rooms has it, the other doesn't. Speaking to others guests theirs didn't work either. As a result the rooms were too hot to sleep well and windows couldn't be opened as it would have been too noisy. I don't believe it worked at all, be warned. Rooms are very small, you have to walk sideways to get around the bed. There is no cupboard space just a place to hang your clothes with a pull across curtain and a shelf above it. The bathroom was a small area about 3 foot by 3 foot. It had a tall shower tray (couldn't be described as a bath as it was only about a foot square). The toilet was very difficult to use as it was squashed into a small space. I'm 12.5 stone and if you're any bigger or have wider hips you're not going to be able to use it easily. The tap on the sink ran very slowly. The shower itself was good however and there was always hot water from it. The towels were like paper - very odd. For the price, this was not good value to me and it would have been better staying a little further out of the centre nr to a Metro station to get better value for money and a better hotel. I would not return. Top tip for Rome - if it's your first time - make sure you take the walking tours which will be touted to you at the colosseum etc - this gets you past the huge queues and was worth it.

The location is great though and in the centre of the city and great for walking to pretty much all of the sites, just watch out for the crazy Italian drivers and moped riders, they don't stop at the pedestrian crossings! Down-side is the rooms are therefore close to noisy nocturnal activities. If you're used to backpacker hostels this will be fine but not at the price. If you are used to real 3+ star hotels you will be dissappointed.

We took the gamble and we were glad we did. Even though we knew we had to look for the entrance very well we still managed to miss it twice. No big deal because we didn't walk far away. In case you want to know: it's exactly next to the sandwich/chocolate/coffee place on the corner. (left hand side, when facing the shop) Staff was perfectly helpful and friendly all the time and the entrance is small but very nice. And then... the amazing artworks of this place! We LOVED it! Let's just say some of it is rather unusual but it gives a great atmosphere to the place. There's something to discover in any corner. The location: it's hard to find a better place at these prices. Walk out of the hotel, cross the street and you are facing over 2000 years of history instantly with the Forum Romano at your feet and the Colosseum dominating the background. The rooms are a bit smallish but have convenient storage space. The TV only had a few channels but who is going to watch TV in a city that's called Rome?! Our bathroom was in need of a bit of a redo but that was basically the only negative that I can tell about the hotel. Breakfast is basic but nice and the coffee was pretty good and unlimited. If you're looking for some really, really, really good food for amazing prices: just around the corner of the hotel go find \"l'Archetto\". It's about 4-5 minutes behind the hotel and get there in time because it's insanely busy (on weekends at 8pm you might find more than 25 people OUTSIDE waiting to get in!!!). Highly recommendable and they do speak english over there.

The bathroom may need updating, but it had a bath and shower and a hairdryer. There was no safe deposit box, so it might be a tip to take some form of wallet to look after your essential paperwork while staying there. The breakfast was rolls, jam etc, some cereal and coffee/tea, which kept us going until lunchtime. I have to say the best thing this hotel offers is most definately its position. So close to so many sights. The bus stop is outside the hotel, so with the window open you have a lot of traffic noise, but it is double glazed and no noise is apparant once the window is closed.

As a young girl staying on her own, the only time i have ever felt afraid whilst travelling. occurred on a nightly basis when the residents of the room next door tried to open the blocked up door, (they often nearly succeeded due to their force!!!). this worried me just for personal safety but also security for my possessions. another feature which led to sleepless nights was the paper thin walls, don't worry about having a TV in your room, because once your neighbours have one, you'll be entertained!!! in addition to this, some people have already commented on the breakfasts, i have to admit i don't know what they're like, due to the fact that those lovely paper like walls and the strange layout meant that the head of my bed was closest to the walls of my neighbours bathroom, so daily, i was awoken by the not so appetising sounds of their bowel movements. don't settle for this because of the location!!! there's many better hotels out there in Rome", "Date": "October 20, 2004"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "3", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Midlands, Republic of Ireland", "Title": "\u201cWhat do you expect for the price!\u201d", "Author": "Sparky041", "ReviewID": "UR2220690", "Content": "Pro: Cheap!

I don't think you could find a better placed hotel and the Piazza Venetzia is stunning at night.

The rooms are okay if you are aiming to be sightseeing most of the day and just need a place to wash and to sleep. Don't bother with breakfast.

Yes, the bathroom was small, but it worked perfectly. The bed was comfy, the art was... interesting. Some of it was laughable and the picture in my room was so horrible I photographed it to scare cats from the garden. BUT THIS HOTEL IS 150% character. Take a look at the location and the price tag. Read the small print on check-in times and remember that Italians have a siesta in the afternoon. If you pan this hotel because you don't get a side-order of fries with the mini-bar, you're missing the point. This is what city breaks on foot are all about. Above all, try saying Buon Giorno, smile and you'll find you are dealing with nice people, too. If you want the Rome experience without the city of Rome but you like candy floss with everything, go to a theme park. Otherwise, try this hotel. I can't guarantee you'll like it but you'll never stop talking about it. Holidays are about memories, not snap-albums. I loved it. So, why didn't I give it full marks?
