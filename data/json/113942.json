We have never had a similar disgusting experience as we had recently in the Touchstone Hotel in San Francisco. After stopping the car, we were molested by a bum requesting money. Check in went ok, elevator was in a miserable condition but our room marked the highlight, a youth hostel being a luxury suite against this. The room looked horrible, the bed covers consisted of two single sheets trying to hide what was within them: a stainy, disgusting piece of cloth calling itself a bed cover. This piece has not seen a cleaner for years... Another pestilent ingredient of our room was the shower curtain: it is difficult to describe the color of the stains on that curtain... yuck! The TV Set was not showing a clear picture, the knobs were broken and the remote did not work, the overall condition of the room was miserable.So we can not recommend this hotel to anyone. It is dirty and the central location does not make up for that.

We reserved a room for 4 nights for 2 adults and 2 kids. The hotel boasted confortably equipped rooms with a desk, t.v., cable, etc. and with breakfast next door at David's deli -- with 3 country fresh eggs, etc.The place was downright horrible. The beds were a cross between platform beds and futons that were so hard and the mattresses so thin that it was virtually impossible to get comfortable. The room looked nothing like the picture on the internet -- it was so small you could barely move around. The windows were so old and rickety that they kept none of the street noise out, so if you were lucky enough to fall asleep on the horrible bed, you would be awakened by noise from the street soon thereafter.The price quoted on the internet for 2 adults and 2 kids was $139/night. When we got there they tried to charge us an extra $10 for each kid. We told them that it didn't say there was an extra charge for the kids on their internet site. The receptionist went on the internet but couldn't find the additonal charge listed and still insisted that it was there somewhere. We said, if she couldn't findit how did they expect us to.The delicious breakfast at David's deli was barely edible and I don't know where they got their Equator Estate coffee, but the coffee at McDonalds is far better.We left after the first night and moved to the Park 55.

We were OK with the simple furnishings and small room when we made our reservation because we were only staying one night. When we first entered the room we could see the street from our window and we could hear the noises from the street even though the windows were closed. We also noticed that the smoke alarm was removed from the room. This was not great, but we tolerated it because we needed a place to stay. We fell asleep at about 11 pm that evening.At about 2:45 am Sat. morning we were awakened by voices outside our third floor window. There were two strangers sitting/standing on the fire escape directly outside our window. We also noticed that one of the window handles that secures the window from the inside was missing meaning that these strangers could enter our room at any time. We were frightened.My girlfriend and I got dressed and ran downstairs to notify the person at the front desk of the interruption. He went outside and looked up to the third floor and then ran upstairs to resolve the situation. The intruders were apparently hotel guests as well. After the front desk person spoke to the guests, he told us he would call the police if this happened again. We are grateful for his action and we were able to sleep the remainder of the night.My girlfriend and I informed the front desk person in the morning of the situation emphasizing that there seems to be a real security and safety threat in the hotel. We also appreciated the efforts of the night desk person. But the day person's reply was that she wish she could help but couldn't.

We were going to see Jersey Boys and wanted to spend the night in the city and not have to drive anywhere once we got there. We also didn't want to spend $200 or more for a room for just one night.After we booked our room, we found the reviews posted here, and were a bit nervous about the place. It was too late to cancel and get a refund, so we figured we'd make the best of it. We were pleasantly surprised to find the place was not the horror story that some of the posts here claim. The '50s style decor of the lobby is actually kind of cool. The lady working the registration desk was quite nice. Very helpful about advising places in the neighborhood to have dinner. Our room was small, but not uncomfortably so. Tiny bathroom, typical of buildings from this era. (1920s or earlier?) Tiny television, but that's not what we were there for. The room was acceptably clean. We were on the fourth floor, which has newer carpeting, so this helps. We did have tthe back alley view, but this is the middle of the city. The platform bed with a matress was a bit hard, but then we are used to a nice pillow top bed at home. We've stayed in nicer hotels that had less comfortable beds. We slept OK, until the garbage truck visited the alley below at 6am. The complimentary breakfast was good and the restaurant clean. The coffee they serve is quite good .The bottom line for us is this: It is what it is. Yes it is old. Yes it is small. If you want the Ritz, go stay there and pay the upscale price. If we were to do the same thing again, we would probably check out some other places in the area, but I wouldn't say that we absolutely wouldn't stay here again.If you want a good chuckle, go in the deli and read the owner's description of the hotel printed on the menu. He talks of the pristine clean hallways, (maybe 50 years ago) and the bird's eye maple decor in the rooms (wood grain plastic laminate) I think this guy bought the place 50 years ago, fixed it up, and hasn't done much else since then.The thing is, it wouldn't take much to make this place really neat. Some paint, redeorating, fix up the bathrooms, and maybe some new matresses, and you would have something,Parking tip. You can go right around the corner and the garage there gives a break to people staying in the hotels.

The reservation form was decent, but we ended up making reservations via phone. What enticed us was that it said it was a bed  breakfast hotel and was just a little less than asking price--it looked like a good value; I will never stay there again even if you paid me $1000/night.In our 2 days there, we saw a total of 2 employees--1 was pleasant, the other not so pleasant; neither fit the title of mafioso.The lobby/front desk was a very small place, but decently decorated. We verified that they would keep our bags after we checked out--something they did end up doing, but we returned to find that our bags stayed unsecured out in the lobby all day next to an unattended frontdesk!The picture of a room on the website was nothing like what we stayed in. The towels didn't absorb water, there were small dark hairs all over the bathroom walls. The shower had scum in every corner. The shower curtain was thinner than shrinkwrap, had holes in it, and wasn't big enough for the shower. The choice of water temperature was either ice or scalding; there is no warm or hot--and I do mean burn-you scalding; so much so that you learn very quickly to avoid all metal in the bathroom, lest you leave your skin behind. The bed had a single small and thin queen mattress. The bed cover consisted of stained, semi-clean sheets wrapped around a significantly stained and dirty comforter. There was a 12 inch tv mounted 7 feet in the air above the only furniture in the room--a wall-attached desk/suitcase holder. My 5'4 wife would have barely fit inside the closet; don't try to use it for clothes. There was only a single power outlet in the room. The carpet was so dirty that I didn't want to take off my shoes--much less walk to the bathroom in my bare feet. There was 1 window overlooking the alleyway. There is no air filter/conditioner/heater--there is a thermostat, but I can only guess that it is to provide hope that the hell you are currently is somewhat in your control.Garbage collection just outside in the alley starts at 7am and lasts for 40 minutes.

When we arrived Saturday evening, they did not have record of the reservation. Luckily we printed out our confirmation information and they were still able to accommodate us at the online price of $79 for a Saturday night stay. The valet parking was $21/24 hours, which is reasonable for San Francisco. We stayed in a room with a single queen size bed. Comfort was OK; hard and a couple springs stiffer than others, but we still had no problem falling asleep. The room we got was a corner room so we had windows on two sides of the room, which was nice considering the lighting in the room was a little dull. There was a lamp on each side of the bed, but neither had a lightbulb in them! But there was an overhead light. The carpet was worn and a bit dirty along the edges of the wall where the vaccuum cleaner probably doesn't catch the dirt. We saw a guitar pick under the bed, which I figure should have been seen by the cleaning staff if they even glanced under the bed for cleaning. The bathroom was OK, tiny shower but good water pressure and plenty of hot water. Soap is provided, but not shampoo. Towels seemed nice and clean. Lighting in bathroom was good enough for putting on make-up. Toilet seemed like it wasn't really cleaned. I took a tissue and wiped it down before using and the tissue was dirty (toilet not cleaned like the sanitized note on it would leave you to believe). We were not given a remote control for the TV, but that was not an issue for us since we spent very little time in the room. To address reviewers' comments on getting into the building, we had no trouble. Although the lobby does close at 8pm (or was it 9?), we arrived around 7:30pm. They gave us a key to the room and a key to the outside door, so as long as you bring your keys with you, you shouldn't have any problems. I guess the only downside is the idea of giving away keys in an age when most higher class hotels are using electronic key cards that can't be easily duplicated.We were pleased with the location, although walking down Taylor seemed a bit sketchy. Just keep on the Union Square side when walking around. San Francisco has a huge homeless problem, so you can't really avoid the panhandling.

The hallways are depressing enough until you get to the room.

There is no TEAM of staff as the literature says, but just one unhappy, rude, bitter individual who should be in any profession besides customer service.
