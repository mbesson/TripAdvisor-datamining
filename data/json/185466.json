Every employee of the hotel that I encountered was friendly and extremely helpful. As others have written, it does have a European boutique hotel feel, perhaps due to its size, decor, and design. Breakfast is quite simple as others have mentioned as well, but considering the highly reasonable nightly charge, it was, to me, expected. Convenience is a definite plus for this location. I flew from the East Coast of the US to Vancouver airport, and found the Skytrain straight forward and a convenient one half hour ride to downtown Vancouver. This hotel is a mere two short blocks from the downtown Vancouver train stop. What's more, when I traveled on to Whistler, the Pacific Coach bus stop was only about a fifteen minute easy walk away. The free included wi-fi was a plus which I used frequently, and there is also a free guest computer available as well. Personally, I had problems with the wi-fi connection on one night, but did not find it overly inconvenient to take my laptop computer to the breakfast room to continue my internet use on that particular evening. On the corner from the hotel is a supermarket, and there is a wide range of inexpensive eateries within a two block radius. The area is very safe also. Perhaps the only potential disadvantage for some may be the shared shower and bathroom. I did not find this to be a problem at all. During my entire stay the hotel was clean and neat. The shared shower and bath facilities were more than adequate, and are located on each floor of the hotel. They, too were kept clean and tidy. I do not hesitate to recommend this hotel to anyone planning a visit to Vancouver. I would definitely return again if the occasion arises (and hope it does).", "Date": "October 8, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Sydney", "Title": "\u201cExcellent location, spotlessly clean, simple!\u201d", "Author": "RicardoMartinez", "ReviewID": "UR119014243", "Content": "I was in a bit of a bind and needed a hotel for one night on a trip to Vancouver recenty. A local friend suggested this hotel, though did say, 'I hope you don't mind the bathroom being over the hallway'. It sounded a bit suspect, but I needed a room for the night, was on a bit of a budget and so I booked the room. What a surprise. On arrival I was impressed with the homely feel of the hotel. Very helpful and friendly reception staff. Up to my room on the second floor. Small, but completely adequate. Wash basin in the room, writing desk, comfy bed (king sized single bed? - smaller than a double). The bathroom and shower was literally across the hallway - and as other reviewers have said, don't be too put off by this. The bathrooms are very well maintained, and very clean. The whole property is spotless. A basic breakfast is included - toast, juice and coffee or cream cheese bagel, served in the small dining area adjacent to the reception. Very clean and comfy and well managed by attentive staff person. If you feel the need for a more substantial breakfast, you'll need to go for a wander. There is a pub and bar right next to this hotel, and I was a bit worried about the noise. I actually ate dinner in there and had a few beers and watched some rugby. Lively, friendly place. I commented about the possible noise when I came back to the hotel, and the reception guy said, 'if it's too loud let me know and I'll go and tell them to turn the music down'.He didn't need to, it wasn't an issue at all. You could walk up to the Granville Street train stop for the Canada Line and have easy access to and from the airport.

The price was originally what attracted me to this hotel. $75 per night is unbeatable in this location. For this price I was expecting a pretty run down hotel and as I approached, the somewhat ghetto hotel sign lived up to expectation. However, I was much more optimistic as soon I got to the front desk. The staff was really friendly (Fred and his son own and run the hotel and it has been in their family since it opened a hundred years ago) and the lobby/breakfast area was really clean and nicely decorated. The room was small for sure (maybe a bit cramped for a couple if you plan on spending much time in the room) but I found that there was plenty of space for me even though I was spending a fair amount of time in the room studying (good free wireless internet). Also the bed and pillows really soft and clean and the room was quiet so sleep was good except on really hot nights (no A/C, just a small fan). The fact that there is no toilet/shower in the room (some more expensive rooms have these in them) was definitely a bit daunting at first. In the end though, it wasn't as issue at all. There are a couple shower/toilet areas on each floor and I never had to wait. Plus there was a sink in the room for shaving etc. Continental breakfast is a bit of an overstatement. A bagel/toast plus drinks (coffe/tea/OJ) and some fruit slices are a bit thin - as much coffee as you want mind you - i could have used some protein but maybe that is no longer \"continental,\" who knows. However, eating healthy during my stay was not an issue at all. There is an IGA marketplace less than hundred meters from the hotel which essentially functioned as my kitchen. The best feature of the marketplace was the self serve salad and fruit bar. Plus the hotel is minutes from literally hundreds of restaurants so variety is not an issue. And if you are intersted in night life, all the clubs are just a stumble away. Overall, I really enjoyed my stay at the kingston.

It is located in a highly busy location, with close access to shopping, bars, restaurants and sports arenas. But if you arrive at the hotel on a weekend night like I did, you'll be amazed to find that the loudness of the city somehow disappears when you walk through the doors of this charming hotel. Because the Kingston is a family establishment, it pays more attention to detail than other hotels in its price range. Don't be fooled by the old 60s hotel sign nearby and the fact that it was built in 1910; the Kingston has been well-preserved. Although the hotel wont win any fashion awards, I appreciated the fact that my single room's carpet was not worn, the windows were not cracked, the ceiling was as spotless as the floor. The cleanliness continued to the bathroom, where it seriously appeared as though someone came around every five minutes to scrub the entire room. This might not sound impressive, but this is a SHARED bath that I'm referring to. The staff was professional, polite and accommodating. Each morning, I came downstairs to the small dining room and a staff member gave me coffee and prepared my toast. This is a nice touch, considering so many places offering a continental breakfast require you to \"grab and go\". They had a nice part of the room partitioned off by a rock fireplace, where I went to eat my meal and watch the news. A NOTE to the budget-minded: Kingston recommends parking at the Westin, just around the corner for $18 per day.

There is also a laundry room on the same floor, with a suggested itinerary for the neophyte to Vancouver, and a modest library for the foot-weary traveller.... Around the corner you can find the Vancouver Public Library, The Queen Elizabeth Theatre, The Playhouse Theatre, The Orpheum Theatre, The Vancouver Art Gallery,and a short bus ride to Stanley Park - an evergreen forest in the centre of the city, where one may walk, jog or simply enjoy the coastal mountains on a nice day. Immediately adjacent to The Kingston Hotel is a little gem of a pub c/w fireplaces, pool tables, sidewalk tables and loaded with atmosphere - it's popular and always busy - a great place to have a short drink, snack or something more substantial at the end of your day.

The manager/owner never greeted anyone which I thought was odd. And I was there four nights. The rest of the staff was great, nice and friendly.", "Date": "September 27, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "4", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Salt Lake City, UT", "Title": "\u201cA great cheap place\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR4388108", "Content": "I stayed at the Kingston Hotel for 4 nights and had a great experience. The single room I stayed in was small but clean, and the shared bathroom on my floor (2nd floor) was very clean, and also nice because it was for single use, so I didn't have to share it while I was using it. Two of the staff members were exceptionally friendly and helpful; the third was not as pleasant as the others but sill helpful. The hotel was offered exactly what it advertised: European-style sleeping rooms with single, double or twin beds, and European-style breakfast. If you are looking for a fancy hotel with big rooms and TV\u2019s, this is not the place for you. But if you want something cheap, clean and at a great location this is an excellent choice.

The room was small had no TV and their breakfast consisted of two pieces of toast and two slices of orange. The hotel had a sauna on my floor that would have completely changed my mind about the place but this sauna didnt work. I made reservations at the downtown hotel as a walk in and was greeted by a pleasant man who worked the afternoon shift but when I came back the next morning to check in after 11 am, the day shift man was very rude, unfriendly and condescending to say the least. I have travelled throughout the US and Europe and stayed in several hotels along the way. I have never ever been treated as coarsely as I did in Canada, which shocked me. Folks in Canada area generally friendly and pleasant but this guy definitely needs to either retire or take a refresher course in customer service. Each day I saw this guy I noticed that he never smiled to anyone and didnt speak to anyone at the desk unless spoken to. I think the Kingston Hotel would be better served if they didnt have this guy as their representative at the front desk, particularly during the morning to early afternoon hours. Perhaps they should replace him with the afternoon or overnight representatives who were both quite friendly.", "Date": "July 6, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "3.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Seattle, WA", "Title": "\u201cNot bad for the price and location.\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR3260143", "Content": "I have stayed at the Kingston every time I have been in Vancouver for the last 7 years and while it is most definately NOT a fancy hotel - it has always been clean, affordable and centrally located.

Both looked okay. I only realized my mistake after booking into the hotel. No parking unless you paid to park at the Westin across the street for $15 for 24 hour parking. No elevators, so you had to lug all your bags up several flights of narrow stairways. No A/C, so the room's really hot (I stayed there in July, and it was SWEATY HOT!). Walls are very thin; I could hear water pipes and my neighbors when they walked around. Security very lax; I left my room locked at 11am, came back at 2pm and found my room door was wide open. Management not responsive; I called the front desk about my open door, but did not receive help nor a call back from the manager or front desk. Very upsetting. Good thing for them that nothing was stolen or rifled through, since the open door was negligence on their part.

It is similar to staying in a converted dormitory. Rooms are very small but comfortable enough. It can get quite noisy since your pillow is literally 2 feet from the hallway so bring earplugs. Lots of Europeans staying here and some backpacker types - definitely a safe place to stay and everything is fairly clean (although after 10 people have showered, the bathroom can get a little soggy). To address the parking issue mentioned in the other review - we parked our car at a ritzy 4-star hotel garage across the street for a small fee and it was fine. Best thing about this place is the location as you can easily walk anywhere you might want to go in downtown Vancouver.

The continental breakfast is toast, coffee and a half of an orange.
