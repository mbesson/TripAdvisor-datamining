This time I decided to try the Palazzo after getting a really good deal on a hotels website. I expected it to be nice but that was an understatement. The basic suite was enormous at over 700 square feet and was absolutely stunning. Separate bedroom and sitting room areas with a high class bathroom thrown in made it an outstanding choice. Upgraded to a high strip view( no pressure to do this) and got a room overlooking TI and with great views all the way to the mountains in the distance. Tried the Grand Lux cafe which had an extensive menu at very reasonable prices and was hardly able to eat the whole portions served. The casino was very plush and had a decent choice of slots which were not overly tight. All in all I was very happy with this resort and would go back without hesitation.", "Date": "March 30, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Dallas, TX", "Title": "\u201cGreat location, spacious rooms, big bathroom!\u201d", "Author": "ldang", "ReviewID": "UR126964439", "Content": "We initially booked 4 hotel rooms at the Venetian for a bachelorette party, but got upgraded to the Palazzo since the Venetian didn't have connecting rooms available.

Bathroom was big with lots of mirrors for all the girls to get ready in. Bathtub was separate from the standing shower. Beds were comfortable, but the pillows were really high and fluffy. It was a great location to walk to the mall at Ceasar Palace and to the night clubs at Wynn & Encore. The casino table minimums was usually $15, so we'd walk to O'Sheas and Harrah's to find $5 tables.

Very nice hotel connected to the shops and the Venetian and Walgreens. I never know when I need to visit Walgreens. Could I add that Lagasee's Stadium Sports Book/Sports Bar is the best Sports Bar I have ever seen! The casino was small and did not wreak of cigarettes. It had everything you need along with nearly full tables all night which is what I look for. From the lobby it is a straight walk through the small casino to the hotel elevators. Perfect! The rooms were reasonably priced and very updated. We got a Prestige Suite which means you check in on the 23rd floor with a champagne reception, free top shelf happy hour every evening and complimentary breakfast buffet every morning. Perfect again.

We have stayed at many hotels on and off the Strip, and we thought this hotel next to the Venetian would be top-notch. First impressions: efficient valet parking, beautiful lobby and short wait in line to check in. The check in process was a little lengthy as there was so much information given on everything from the snacks for purchase in the room (one little movement of a box of snacks will incur a charge) to the strict check out time of 11:00 am and if we go one minute past the check out time we will be charged. The nice feature on the layout of the hotel is that there is a straight line short walk from the hotel lobby to the guest room elevators, so guests do not have a long walk through the casino to get to their rooms. We had the Bella Suite and liked the size of the room and the bathroom, but upon closer inspection were disappointed at the worn furnishings. The sectional sofa was stained and had a missing button and loose elastic thread, the bureau and table were scratched up and tacky, the carpet was worn and the phones were outdated. The hotel is 5 years old but the furniture seemed like it was 10 years old or older. The staff were friendly and efficient when we requested toiletries and towels, and the quality of the toiletries was excellent. The wifi was a little tedious to get set up, and was not lightening fast but adequate. With the resort fee of $20.00 per day, we thought there would be a paper delivered to our suite daily, but no, we were told that complimentary papers were available downstairs near the coffee shop. The only papers to be found were in the convenience store across from the coffee shop and were not complimentary.

Newer than the Venetian, I found the facilities to be of higher functioning quality and cleaner. We were lucky enough to snag a Strip-view room on the 39th floor and enjoyed watching the Treasure Island volcano erupt at night. Conference staff were top-notch and the rest of our interactions with staff members were a mixed bag with some going out of their way to be of assistance (Security) while others couldn't be bothered (Grazie and Housekeeping). In fact, my only real negative experiences were with housekeeping for a variety of reasons including some cleanliness issues like not exchanging the wine/water glasses and former guest business cards and rubbish on the floor as well. I was also disappointed that they did not visit my room twice during my five night stay, even though it was available from 11-5. I also noticed that even though the hotel conserves water only changing sheets when requested, it also claims the sheets will be changed on your 3rd night regardless and they were not. None of these issues are terribly significant but I was surprised to be asked on my second day there why I had not left the room yet and if I had a late check-out -- I explained I was actually there for 3 more nights. On the actual check-out day, housekeeping attempted to enter the room at 9:30 am and luckily I had the bar lock over the door preventing their entry because they provided a quick rudimentary knock before attempting to open the door. Resort Fee Tip: The resort fee includes a complimentary newspaper and coffee daily at Cafe Presse on the second floor near the guest elevators - don't miss it! Fee also includes access to the fitness facility with a variety of cardio, assisted weights, and free weights available. Unfortunately I only found out on my last day there that I could pay $20 to attend a group fitness class which would give me access to the various water features of the spa for the remainder of the day - a bargain and a feature I would certainly have utilized.

I did a lot of research before booking and honestly did not find that much by way of reviews for the Prestige Level. So, I wanted to let you know what you can expect! You however must decide if you think it is worth the extra money. In my opinion it is worth every penny! The lounge area is huge at about 11,000 square feet! There are lots of tables, soft and big comfortable chairs as well as lots of couches and a few large screen TVs. However what sets this place apart is the view, day or night, it is breathtaking with floor to ceiling windows of the Las Vegas Strip and the distant mountain range. This is a great spot any time of the day when you want to get away from the noise of the casino and just need a break to relax to hear yourself think! If you are in Vegas on business there is one section of the lounge where there is a large conference room area that can be reserved and closed off if you need to have a private meeting. Bathrooms are also located within the lounge on the end closest to the meeting space. The lounge also allows you access to a small business center i.e. a space with four computers and a printer provided at no extra charge. So, you can take your time checking your email or print out your boarding pass. The floor itself has complimentary Wi-Fi access throughout. The lounge has DVD Library if you are in the mood to take a movie back in your room. You can also request some fresh popcorn to enjoy with your movie. A USA Today newspaper will be hung on your door for every morning of your stay and you are allowed complimentary local and 1-800 calling as well. By upgrading to the Prestige Level this qualifies you for private champagne check in upon arrival starting at 10 am. In part of the lounge there is a bar where you can order mixed drinks. All ages are permitted in this section until 10:00 a.m. A continental breakfast is served on the floor from 7 am to 10am. You can expect being able to have water, coffee, tea, juices, soft drinks as well as your choice of a hot egg dish, warm pastries, hot oatmeal as well as toast, bagels, and various other sweet rolls and bread and several cereals. In the afternoon from 10 am to 4 pm they have tea, coffee, bottle water and soft drinks and a few snacks i.e. peanuts and M&Ms. Hot and cold Hors d'Oeuvres are provided from 5 pm to 7 pm and a finally a few cookies and snacks are put out later. The lounge closes at 9 pm. By upgrading to this level this also allows you access to the Canyon Ranch SpaClub fitness facility that is located on the third floor of the hotel. If you want to enjoy the spa itself with the different saunas, lounges and whirlpool you pay only $20 to get in and you can stay as long as you like relaxing. The 23rd floor is not key card protected. However, after you get off the elevators and before you can enter the lounge you will be asked to show your room card that identifies you as a Prestige Card holder. Don't expect to sneak in if you are not a card holder, it won't work! The concierges at these desks are very friendly, but protective of the lounge and sharp. They are also happy to help you with any restaurant reservations or show tickets you might need.

While the Venetian is an upscale property in its own right, the subdued Palazzo makes it feel garish by comparison. The lobby was spacious yet did not feel frantic or mobbed like some casino hotels. The front desk experience was prompt, and courteous as was the bell service. The requisite long walk through the casino was along a wide spacious aisle that did not overwhelm you or make you feel assaulted by smoke and slot machine players. Fast elevator ride to our room which was on a higher floor with access to the club level on 23. The club is a great and relaxing space with complimentary breakfast, beverages, and light dinner every day. Truly a civilized space in what can be the craziness of Las Vegas. The elevators were fine, except for the constant \"Phatom of the Opera\" music playing. After a few days it will drive all but the biggest Phantom fans absolutely crazy. The hallways were softly lit, but very clean. Walks to rooms on the edges of the floor could be a bit long. The room was a cleanly and elegantly furnished suite which offerec a spacious bedroom, and a step down to a living room area with a small dining table and desk in it as well as a sofa and TV. We had a nice view of the front of the property overlooking the pool deck and the Treasure Island hotel, which runs a pirate show a few times a night. The bed was very comfortable as was the climate control system for the room. The bathroom was nicely appointed and very spacious with a large glass shower, one person spa tub, and a separate room for the toilet. Small issues - the toilet room light was very dim, and the shower head had low pressure with no options for other settings. Really very minor issues. Room service was prompt, courteous and well priced. The BLT was excellent! There was no excessive noise from the hallway or adjoining rooms. A few more easily accessible plugs near the bed would have been nice to accommodate charging the cell phones and tablet devices. There is an upscale shopping area in the hotel and it connects to the Venetian's shopping area as well, so there is plenty to see and do, as well as good restaurants to eat at. There is a Walgreens in the complex, as well as a gift shop for any last minute needs.

Reception dealt with checkin swiftly and i was soon dragging my bag through the casino to my excellent room. First time i've ever stayed in a room with 3 x TVs ! One thing i did notice was that although smoking was allowed in most areas it was never oppressive as the ventilation systems seemed to get rid of it very effectively, even in the bars. Had breakfast at the Grande Lux Cafe a few times, TOP TIP: always have the buffet ! At only $16 or so it includes all you food, coffee and juices, huge amount of choice of hot and cold food in the American buffet style i.e.lots and lots ! Best bar i found was the one next to the Cafe where 2 guys played piano requests all evening from about 7pm til late. The hotel has a fancy shopping mall like many other hotels, it links into the Venetian shops which run along the indoor \"Grande Canal\" but if want some regular shopping rather than the \"designer\" shops in the hotel then The Fashion Show Mall is right across the street and has a Macys, Dillards, Nieman Marcus, Apple Store, and plenty of smaller shops selling pretty much everything, Also opposite is the Treasure Island hotel ,or TI as it seems to be re-branding, a good bar at the front on the strip, can't remember the name but a WIld West theme. Not much more to say, there are so many restaurants (mostly quite pricey), cafes, shops, etc to keep you busy for weeks but always check the menu before you go in and do not mistake the lunch menu for the dinner menu !

Also the pool that is open until 10pm in the off season would require me to walk in my robe or bathing suit down to the casino or shopping level and walk all the way to the Venetian and the then up to the 10th floor to use the facilities, not even worth the trip as the jacuzzis were bearly heated to 90 degrees. Non smoking room that I rented for my children smelled of smoke. Won't stay here again with so many choices available with better locations on the strip. One more thing that bothered me was that they have such an elaborate service elevator system and back door access for employees that I was shocked when a janitor wheeled a trashcan into the guest elevator and rode down to the ground floor with the guests, hopefully the eye in the sky saw this and the employee was informed that this is not acceptabel in a 5 star hotel, thats why they have staff elevators.", "Date": "February 23, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Houston, TX", "Title": "\u201cGreat Hotel\u201d", "Author": "Deborah134", "ReviewID": "UR125097088", "Content": "We love this hotel.

The suite was beautiful with plenty of room, a fantastic strip view, 3 flat screen TVs, and the pull out sleeper meant we all had our own place to crash. The Prestige upgrade price waives resort fees and includes access to the Canyon Ranch spa and gym, paper delivery and best of all, access to the Prestige lounge. The lounge does a decent continental breakfast every day and includes several hours of open bar and apps in the afternoon and evening - a great happy hour stop. Prestige also includes a good collection of discount tickets and two-for-one drinks in Casino bars. All well worth the upgrade. Meanwhile the location on the strip was great for walking, and Palazzo casino was definitely less busy on a very crowded president's day weekend.

We heard someone staying right next room to us fighting with high pitch noise on our way to our room. We were worry that we may have to request different room. But the wall was thick enough, when we went into our room and shut the door, you can't hear anything. Thank goodness! The room was very spacious and it has 3 TVs in the room including the bathroom. Bit over kill for studio room. TV in the bathroom was installed at the top coner of the sink. However the bathtub where you rest your head was in the same direction as the TV wall was. so I couldn't enjoy watching TV while relaxing in the hot tub.

Bathroom: The shower lacks shelf space, so there was no place to put wash towels. It could also use some secure metal handle bar in the shower incase anyone need to hold on to the slippy floor (especially older person or kids). It's safety issue, I think. Cleaness of the room: It's Ok. NOthing outstanding.

I am not against leaving the tips even if I get bad service. But I am sorry, I don't want to be forced to put tips on cup of coffee and yogurt that I serice myself.

We had such a wonderful stay at the Encore only 2 years before so it had a lot to live up to. When I checked-in they didnt have any smoking rooms in Palazzo but had availability in the Venetian. I was told they would try to get me a room in the Palazzo from the next day (7 nights in total). I wasnt very happy with this as I had specfically booked via their own website in order to try to minimise the risk of this happening. We made the walk from Palazzo reception to the Venetian guest suites (luggage would be brought over later). The rooms at the Venetian were very similar to the Palazzo and we ended up staying the one night. See my other review for Venetian We went to the Palazzo reception the next day at 10am and as promised they had a smoking room available and were in the process of cleaning it. We were apologised to and told they had upgraded us to a strip view room. We went off shopping and our luggage was brought over to our new rooms whilst we were away. I really like the layout of the rooms at Palazzo (compared to Encore). The sitting area is far more usable and the rooms look very large. The actual quality of the room cleaning and the furniture was better at the Encore. I also enjoyed having the wi-fi available throughout the property as my wife and I would message/talk to each other and to family back home over the internet (to keep our international roaming charges down). Room - Very nice, looks very modern and very spacious with seperate sitting area. The bed was very comfortable and the remote control for the drapes was cool (a trend among better hotels). In total there were three flat screen TV's and there was quite a few choices of HD channels (42\" in the bedroom, 32\" in the sitting area and a small one in the bathroom). Bathroom was nice with two sinks and seperate glass enclosed shower (could do with more water pressure). There was also a seperate vanity unit with hair dryer. View - We had a wonderful view of the strip and the Treasure Island hotel from our window and looking down we could see the pools. At night the view came alive and I spent a lot time looking out of the window. Casino - Really enjoyed spending time in the casino as it was very spacious and the cocktail service was usually quite good (seemed to get better after 5pm). Restaurants Bouchon (Venetian) for breakfast and it was nice but it was bit of an anti-climax. I will try Morels next time. Grand Lux Cafe - for breakfast. We ordered from the menu (not buffet) and were very impressed with the speed and quality of the food. The red velvet pancakes were out of this world!! Sushisamba - My wife really enjoyed the sushi and we liked some of the different roll combinations Tao (Venetian) - This was the most dissapointing meal of our whole trip, PF changs makes better chinese food and sushisamba has better sushi rolls. I'm not sure I would come back to this restaurant as there are better asian choices in the Wynn (Okado and Wing Lei are fantastic) Nightlife - We went to Tao nightclub for the evening and it was very nice and the music was great, dance floor gets very busy (we had a great time re-living our youth) Location - If you look for signs to the Sands bridge this will get you over to the Wynn and then another bridge for Fashion Show Mall. Walgreens is very conveniently located at the outside of the Palazzo for all your pharmacy/drink/snacks/gifts.

I was skeptical, never having been to Vegas, but \"The Hangover #1,\" which we watched with my sister-in-law at Christmas 2011 convinced me to go see the sights of Vegas. I must admit, we were blown away with the elegance of the Palazzo. It has all of the fresh, bright appeal of the more expensive Bellagio, the Wynn and the Encore, but bigger rooms (suites!) and a very affordable club level that treats you like you're royalty. The Palazzo charged a $100/day/room up charge for the club level, but the value is worth it! We enjoyed luxurious breakfasts, which meant that we could dispense with lunch . . . and simply wander and enjoy the sights all day, or linger and gamble in the luxurious casino, or walk the mall that truly makes you feel like you're in Venice (with the seemingly real-life fresco sky of an open air market). In addition, the shops at the Palazzo are all high-end, so just browsing the mall is enjoyable. We enjoyed evening cocktail receptions every night with a buffet of heavy hors devours which were as delicious as any 4 or 5 - star restaurant. They even had several of the Venetian restaurant chefs saut\u00e9ing tasty Italian pasta. In addition, the views from the club lounge are among the best along the strip! The best part of the Palazzo, in our opinion, is the rooms. They are suites that include a living room space, bedroom space, and large, luxurious bathroom, with shower, soaking tub, and private water closet. We felt like nobility, relaxing every evening after a day among the wild and crazy sights of the strip. Our favorite shows were Le Reve (DO NOT MISS THIS SHOW, IT IS AMAZING) and the Beatles' expose, Love! We also enjoyed the old-fashioned, but still-sensual \"Jubilee,\" although the hotel, which houses the theatre, needs a complete makeover (on the inside).

Check in was easy, the staff, bellman and housekeeping are very professional. We stayed on the 40th floor in a Bella View Suite. As everyone else has stated, the suites are amazing. Very large, a TV in the bathroom and a seperate water closet for the toilet. A word of advice--ask for a humidifier for your room. Vegas is very dry and the humidifier was such a help. As we were three women staying in this suite we were a bit demanding on housekeeping but they delivered everything we asked for in a timely manner. (extra towels, glassware & toileties.) I must say room service was horrible. I wish there were coffee makers in the room and that refridgerators did not cost $25/day. Room service--took an hour to get a pot of coffee, two bagels and two glasses of orange juice. Yes we were there over super bowl weekend and it was busy but that wasn't the worst of it. When the delivery girl dropped off our tray I noticed as she closed our door she had not brought any cream and I had even ordered extra cream. Instead of yelling down the hall I called downstairs and was told they would send her right back up. Another hour went by and still no cream. Now the pot of coffee was cold and it was 10am by now.I was very angry and of course they removed the $50 room service charge for those 5 items but did not credit me the $3 extra I had added to the bill when signing it. But that is my fault for not realizing they add 18% to the bill automatically. I did do a bit of gambling (table games) at the Palazzo and also at the Venitian. The hotels are connected by a beautiful walkway and very nice shops. Make sure to find the little cupcake stand at the entrance to the Ventian--yummy and not too expensive! There is a grand lux cafe in both hotels but the one in the Venitian stays open later so you can grab a bite to eat after a night of gambling.

Got a great rate for the weekend using this method by searching for five star properties...was pretty sure it would be either the Palazzo or the Venetian which are sister properties. The deal with booking it this way is you have to pay in advance, the reservation cannot be changed or cancelled and you don't know what property you get until after you have prepaid. They still charge the resort fee of $20 for each night which is payable when you check-out. Not a big fan of the resort fee...basically covers internet access which was handy for getting our boarding passes which you can print right in your room and covers access to the fitness center (not the spa), and supposedly a newspaper which we never saw. I have to say the best part of our stay at the Palazzo was TAO nightclub. There is a separate line for hotel guests which allowed us to by-pass a huge line of people waiting to get in. The club has plenty of private sitting areas that can be reserved for your group. Great music and lots of dancing. This is definitely the place to be. Check-in: We arrived early in the morning about 10:30 a.m. and I fully expected that we would have to wait for our room to be ready and have the hotel store our luggage. I was pleasantly surprised that our room was available at that time and we didn't have to wait. The line was short, we waited only a couple of minutes for the next available clerk. However, when we asked if there were any upgrades available the clerk gave a little attitude by saying that nothing was available and something about the fact that they have over 7000 hotel rooms and all are nice. I would have liked to upgrade to the prestige level but weren't even given the opportunity. We were given a couple vouchers Room: These are huge rooms and nicely laid out. Our room was on the 34th floor with a view overlooking the Wynn, golf course, pools and mountains. Room was in excellent condition, clean and very spacious. We had a very comfy king bed, with the sunken living area. The bathroom was very spacious with double sinks, a separate make-up/vanity area, separate shower and big soaking tub, and toilet in it's only little room. We called housekeeping to get extra towels and toiletries and they were delivered within minutes. Housekeeping staff was very friendly and attentive and showed up early the next day to clean the room so we didn't have to wait all day like I've read in other reviews. We didn't touch anything in the fully stocked refrigerator or on the bar but there is plenty to choose from if you desire, just expensive. Wish there was a little room in there to store your own items or a separate refrigerator. Used the in room safe which is spacious enough to hold a laptop and even has an electrical socket so you can plug your devices in to charge while in the safe. There are three televisions in the room, one in the living area, one above the bed area and one in the bathroom. I also really liked having our own copier/printer/fax machine in our room. The draperies/shades for the window are nice because they are remote control operated so you don't have to go over to adjust them. Check-out: We did call to ask for a late check-out because we could have gone directly from the hotel to the airport but was told that was not possible. Went down to check-out which was fairly quick and had the hotel store our luggage. With the exception of the clerk at check-in, all the staff were very friendly, helpful and professional. We spent our remaining time walking through the hotel which is very beautiful into the grand canal shops at the Venetian which is a definite must see. I did go to the Canyon Ranch Spa while at the hotel which is definitely worth it.

Being 3 full grown male adults and needing 3 beds in the same room is a hard thing to find in las Vegas, most places will force you to get a second room or to share a bed which isn't happening. The Pallazzo being an all suite hotel does have rooms with pull out sofa \"bed\" to accomodate us (more on the sofa \"bed\" later) The room was really nice and clean, but had limited storage space for clothes, and $20 for 24hrs of internet service! really Really weird about the bathroom was that the toilet was in it's own little closet, which I've never seen before. All the Restaurants in Both the Palazzo and the Venetian are top shelf, and I will review those seperately. So back to the sofa \"bed\" when we made the reservations they specifically knew that we wanted the 3rd bed to be in use. When we checked in not only was the bed not pulled out and made, there wasn't even any bedding in the room for it, a call down to housekeeping fixed that, sort of, the bedding was brought up and left. No effort to make the extra bed or even offer to make it was done. This actually turned out to be a blessing because the mattress on that \"bed\" was the worst i've ever slept on. The bright side was that the sofa cushions were on the sofa part were very comfortable. If you're ever in the situation that you need to sleep some extra people in a room don't even consider pulling out the \"bed\" just ask for the bedding and sleep on the sofa", "Date": "January 31, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Fargo, North Dakota", "Title": "\u201cBeautiful Suites\u201d", "Author": "pme701", "ReviewID": "UR123930641", "Content": "The suites of Palazzo are very much like those in Venetian though slightly more modern and updated.

Recently I've been feeling an urge to go back, which isn't in the cards right now so a review is the next best thing. First of all, this is an incredible physical property. It is NOT a true luxury hotel, but it is a very, very nice hotel that most will find enjoyable. The rooms are luxurious, and worthy of a 4+ star rating, the service does not. The rooms themselves are larged. Mine was in good condition, with fresh furniture and no order. I had paid extra for a Strip view and was disappointed...the property is simply not oriented properly for much of a view. We found the room to be quieter than most and didn't hear any neighbors during our entire stay. The casino is a slighly nicer version of The Venetians. I wish that the \"smoke free corridors\" were more segregated and better enforced--I have to believe there is a market for a real smoke free casino in Vegas, it would be an interesting experiment. There are a multitude of dining options--I reviewed several. A major advantage of staying here is easy and indoor access to the Venetian--with its landmark Grand Canal Shops and dining options. Parking is quite easy and plentiful. This aspect was well designed for such a huge property. The Palazzo's location on the strip is a little bit north of the action, but just across a pedestrian bridge from the Wynn Resorts and across the street from the always buzzing Mirage. My only significant complaint is the staff--unfriendly, no warmth, and no particular desire to please. Also, my room was not ready at the appointed check in time, with no apology and no voucher for something to make up for the fact that I was stuck for an entire extra hour with no room to go to.

The bathroom also has a separate area, with a door, for the toilet. The beds were comfy and roomy. There was only one center nightstand between the two beds. Two nightstands would be great, especially when there are more than two people in a room. The minibar was well stocked, but pricey. FOOD: The Grand Lux is now a restaurant with very average, over-priced food. Nothing that any of us ate was worth mentioning. We did go over to the Venetian and they have a food court area that had very reasonable breakfast selections. Defnitely worth a stop. Our main focus this trip was to see the shows though. I will review those in a separate post: Le Reve, Menopause the Musical, Hitsville and Rita Rudner. CONS: The hotel is showing it's wear from my previous visit 2 years ago, scuffed woodwork and wallpaper. Poor housecleaning - I dropped something on the floor by the bed and found a mini bottle of water by the nightstand that was covered by the spread - we never had a water bottle. Cushions on sectional wearing down...just little things, but not paying enough attention to details.

I think I have probably been won over by The Wynn and The Encore and may not find anything that comes close to the ambiance of these 2 superb hotels. The Palazzo is very big, it looks big and it feels big. We chose the prestige suites, which is excellent value for money. This is one area that The Palazzo excelled at. Although the cost seems significantly higher than a standard suite, it includes continental breakfast (which was very good), canapes and light snacks early evening and a free bar 5-8pm. If you take advantage of all of these included items, (and remember every drink is usually $10), the extra cost of prestige is well worth it. It also includes free internet access. We were there over New Year and quite a few people were taking full advantage of the free bar. Bearing in mind it was New Year, and allowing for the number people in the hotel and the number of drunk people wandering around, I have to say i was still a little disappointed in the system for checking who was going up to the rooms. A point for management to look at is how they control the number of people getting access to rooms on one card; we counted 13 at one point. Were they all sleeping in one room? The rooms are spacious, room service was excellent and the cleaners were very good, especially as they were constantly cleaning up after New Year party animals. We ate at Wolfgang Puck's Cut - superb, best steak ever and Aquaknox is also very good.

On the second day, we just walked over to the Venetian and used their pool so we could have sunshine before the afternoon. Also, I find it fascinating that a hotel can charge like $400 per night for a room and then not have poolside food service.

I had one bad experience at check in (thus the 4 stars instad of 5) where they didn't show our spa credit on our reservation package and it frustrated me that it took us speaking to a manager to get it resolved. Careful when you are booking packages b/c they don't have this information at check in. However, I had a great experience with security when I had to break up a ridiculous party next door that was so loud I thought I was still at Tao. Security handled it great and ended up either kicking out the people or moving them to another room. My migraine appreciated their help and we had a peaceful two night stay. I didn't notice any smoke smell in our room as I have at other hotels. We had a nice time playing craps, poker, etc. in the casion and they certainly made a lot of money off us that weekend!

After a workout in a gym with every amenity, I was able to head to the spa take a shower and relax in style. I splurged one day and also had a massage, definitely one of the best ever.

We requested extra towels and they were delivered quickly. Our room was spotlessly clean and kept that way. The staff is polite, efficient, kind and extremely busy. If you are expecting an personalized experience, this may not be the best choice. However, if you want an incredible place to stay, in an incredible location, with very good service, this is your place .", "Date": "December 30, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "london", "Title": "\u201cNice hotel, but lacks special touch\u201d", "Author": "dubaiman", "ReviewID": "UR122303976", "Content": "Stayed for 5 nights in a Prestige Sienna Suite, Suite was very good, prestige lounge is bit of a let down, it seems its done, because they have to, but not done with any real purpose.

The rooms are identical to the Venetian rooms from 5 years ago. And I do mean identical. Maybe that's why I was less than enthused with the Palazzo. And for being built in 2007, the rooms are really showing a lot of wear. Yes, the smallest rooms are 720 sq. feet which is huge for Vegas, but they just don't enthuse me. Dated and starting to look worn down. Housekeeping was good, very clean linens, which is a must for me. But as others have said, I really don't need to see dirty linens sitting in the hallways for days at a time. We paid the $17/day resort fee but never once received a newspaper, which was supposedly part of the fee. (not a major deal, but just shows they miss the small things). Casino was ho-hum....no energy, not a good vibe...not a fun place to lose your money. Palazzo Shops and Venetian Grand Canal ok...but you see the same shops at every other Casino. And nothing has changed in many years. We did enjoy Morels for breakfast...you can't pass up the hand-made Bloody Mary's! And we really enjoyed Puck's Postrio Restaurant in the Venetian shops. Overall, while the central location was good, I'm not sure I will be back to the Palazzo. Dated rooms and bags of linen in the hallways were a major turnoff this time.

In Jan 2011 we stayed at the Venetian so this trip we selected the sister property the Palazzo. The rooms are similar in size and decore, but the Palzzo seems to be a slight upgrade in quality. Either property is a excellent choice for a visit. The rooms are large (750 sq ft) and have a sunken living room. The window coverings are opened/closed using a remote which allows you to control them from the comfort of your bed! If you go, it is worth joing the Grazie club. By charging meals to your room, points can accumulate quickly and depending on your casino play could result in comp points that can be used to reduce your bill. The Venetian/Palazzo complex is large and a reasonable copy of various parts of Venice Italy, including gondola rides. There are several shows (Jersey Boys, Blue Man Group, Phantom...), two large casinos, a multitude of places to eat from elegant dinning to fast food, many interesting shopping areas, buskers in St Mark's square, a waterfall and much more. You may find there is no need to venture out of the complex to have a great time. A recent added feature is the inclusion of these properties into the Priority Points program (associated with Holiday Inn). From 'check in' to 'check out' we found the entire staff were helpful and friendly. We can highly recommend both properties and are sure you will be pleased with either and likely have a wonderful experience as we did on both occasions.

My wife and I just returned from Las Vegas for a quick 4 night get-away before Christmas, sans children. We have been to Vegas 20+ times, and have always been loyal Ceasar's/Harrah's customers and have stayed in virtually every resort on the strip. Because it was just us this time and we were celebrating a belated 10 year anniversary, I decided to book the Palazzo. We booked a very affordable SWA package in a standard Luxury Suite, hoping to sweet talk our way to an upgrade upon arrival. We were impressed immediately upon arrival. The lobby was decorated beautifully for Christmas and there were even staff dressed as Elves giving out hot cider in the lobby. The staff was very friendly and helpful from the doorman to the check-in counter. It was really quiet it seemed for a Saturday afternoon arrival, but we traveled during a dead period on purpose (Dec. 17-21). There were no lines at check-in, or at the airport for that mattter...it was very nice. Anyway, back to the hotel. We approached the check-in desk and were helped immediately by a very polite young woman. She went to work on getting us checked in and then asked us if we would like to hear about upgrades. I had planned for this, so I said that I was always interested. Apparenlty she had read my comments on my reservation and knew we were Diamond players from Ceasar's and were also celebrating a big anniversary. I didn't think they really read those! Well, I had done my research and kind of knew what to expect, what the room upgrades were, suites, prestige levels, etc. She came back and offered me a Fortuna suite upgrade for $75/night or a Sienna suite for $150/night. I got the entire package for $1005, including airfare, so I had some room to spend a little extra if I wanted. I stalled a little, made an offer and got her to upgrade me to a Fortuna suite for $50...but they were booked. Long story short, I ended up getting a HUGE sienna suite for the same price! It was a giant room, huge bathroom, half bath in hallway entry, great views, etc. We even had an exercise room with an eliptical machine in it. I bet this suite was 1500 sq feet. Now I don't know why I got this deal...maybe the young lady was in a good mood, maybe she was wooing us from Ceasar's or simply being nice for our anniversary...whatever the reason I was totally satisfied. The only bad thing was the room was TOO big if you can believe that! I was pleased with the entire check-in/room experience and was pleased with housekeeping - no issues. The restaurants were plentiful and had something for everyone - expensive to affordable. I really liked 24hr Grand Lux cafe in the casino. Lots to choose from and very good. No buffett, but plenty of choices. The Venetian is close by for additional restaurants and the food court if you like. The Casion was small by Vegas standards, but nice...somewhat older, more sophisticated crowd. I had no problems finding a table or a slot machine I wanted to play. Table limits were generally $15+, but I did see a few $10 tables at various times. Tons of choices in slots, from pennies to high limits. Staff was friendly and helpful - no problem getting a drink whether I was betting $25 a hand or sitting with my wife as she banged away on a penny machine. Security was everywhere, even though I didn't see or feel a need. I felt very safe, as did my wife. The Venetian Casion was a close by and was a livlier, younger crowd. Table limits were lower, but there were more typical young vegas yay-hoos there. We enjoyed playing the Palazzo and the Venetian. The Pool was actually open and it was heated to a very nice temperature for swimming. There were even people swimming and laying out. The jacuzzi/hot tubs were big and steaming hot. I was impressed that you could swim in a heated pool in December - that is rare in Vegas. The pool is not huge, but was very classy. I can imagine pool season at the Palazzo is a site to behold (and the security guard confirmed my suspicion)! Location was fine for what we wanted on this trip. It is an easy walk to Venetian, Wynn, the Fashion Show Mall, Ceasar's, Mirage, etc. The Bellagio was a pretty good hike and City Center was a long hike. We had planned to eat at the Cosmo Buffett Wicked Spoon, but didn't feel like walking so far. If you want to hang out at the MGM or Mandalay, then don't stay at Palazzo. I felt the Palazzo was located in the classiest part of the strip and was satisfied witht he location for our needs. All in all, we had a great time...ate good, lived like kings, won some, lost some but would definitely recommend the Palazzo. Some reviews on here gave me reason for concern prior to our trip, but I found them to be incorrect. I am sure every property has ups and downs, but our experience was simply awesome. I am a convert and will return to the Palazzo for our next trip, but will probably just go with a normal Luxury suite...they are plenty big.", "Date": "December 21, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Auckland, New Zealand", "Title": "\u201cBeautiful hotel\u201d", "Author": "dibbyfromtheblock", "ReviewID": "UR121924171", "Content": "Truly great service, gorgeous rooms, and wonderful experience.", "Date": "December 20, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Montague, New Jersey", "Title": "\u201c4 Days In Paradise\u201d", "Author": "Michael G", "ReviewID": "UR121905916", "Content": "We enjoyed 4 Days in a wonderful Luxury Suite (Basic Room).

Great food, Incredible parfait for chocoholics, Good service, one-of-a-kind ambiance, . The real scenery starts walking in after 9PM.

Unfortunately, the staff training and service needs upgrading. One example is the sofa bed in our suite. We asked for linens and service so the bed would be ready for one of our party when we arrived. That was not the case. After a couple of calls to housekeeping, a bellman arrived and opened the sofa. Period. We told him we were perfectly capable of performing that task, but we had expected it to be ready and had no bed linens for it. He came back with a couple of pillows and a cheap blanket with a cigarette burn hole in it. The other two beds had very nice comforters with duvet covers. We pointed this out to him and explained as best we could, since his English was limited, that the sofa bed needed the same covers as the other two. He returned with a comforter without the duvet cover. At that point, we decided to cut our losses and take the comforter along with the linens and make the bed ourselves and as presentable as possible for our party who had not yet arrived. Although the city was not busy at all according to Las Vegas standards, room service was always late, and in the case of the last day, some if the food was cold. Upon checkout, since the car was at the Venetian (more about that in another review) we were told by the bellman who took our bags that the bags would be at the concierge desk at the Venetian since the car couldn't be brought over to the Palazzo. When we arrived at the Venetian, no big surprise, the bags were not there. After attempts by the staff to communicate back and forth, which took another 40 minutes, we ended up getting the car and driving back to the Palazzo, where our bags were waiting downstairs.

We took the obligatory gondola ride and enjoyed that too. Lots of window shopping but the stores were a bit over our head for the most part. The housekeeping staff did a terrific job. In fact, all of the staff we encountered were very pleasant and helpful. The location of the Palazzo was terrific for our needs. It is a little further north than center strip but it was an easy walk across the street to the Wynn and also pretty easy to get to Cesar's and the Mirage. The monorail is behind Harrah's, next door, and that was a pretty convenient way to get north to the Stratosphere and south to the MGM, Mandalay Bay, etc. Most notable, the Palazzo/Venetian was probably the most well decorated resort on the strip in terms of the Christmas celebration. Lots of activities going on in and around the resort. Christmas decor inside and out was spectacular. Many opportunities for great pictures and it really got us into the spirit of the season.

Having said that I would've had just as good a time at many other properties in Vegas at a lower price. Normally the Palazzo would be out of my price range but middle of the slow season (just before American thanksgiving) it was down to an affordable luxury. I do not know the exact final rate as my friend covered the room cost but I believe it was around $150/night inclusive of taxes and the dreaded resort fee. Some of the luxuries included a great view of the Wynn and the Wynn's golf course, a beautiful bathroom with tub, seperate shower and a private wc, marble everywhere, flat panel tv's wherever you may be sitting, and a remote control for your curtains (I loved this made me feel like a big shot). There was some downsides mainly the room was not perfect and I know in a hotel this should be expected but for the price I didn't expect to be able obvious stains on the dressing chairs located at the end of the bed, you could tell the maid had run through the room and missed the same spots time and time again in the corners, just the little things. The things you could accept at a lower price. This was my 4th time in Las Vegas and this hotel was most definitely the best location I have stayed at to date (others are the Luxor, Stratusphere, and Terrible's(offstrip)) It is however a little to the slow end of the strip but the views were great (42nd floor). Everyone we came across from front desk to security, to service staff were excellent, and this is what I would expect at a higher end hotel and was pleased with the knowledge and eagerness to help. I doubt I would stay at the Palazzo again I would maybe however stay at the Venetian (same complex) as I believe it costs a little less and I did spend more of my time wandering through the amenities on their side of the complex (poker room, grand canal shops).

However, the front desk said that the resort fee charged to my room was approximately $20+ per day, and I had called the front desk on my date of arrival and verified that I was going to use the internet connection at the posted rate of $12.95 per day and not use the resort services associated with the higher $20+ fee.

This is a beautiful property, and I want to start out by saying that I would definitely stay here again. However, there were a few small mistakes that I just feel prevent me from rating this hotel as a five star stay. Upon entering our Bella Suite on the 10th non-smoking floor, we immediately noticed a faint smell of cigarette smoke. We also noticed that there was no hair dryer in the room. So that we wouldn't be charged for either, I went back down to the front desk to report. The front desk was very helpful. She immediately made remarks on our account, and then offered to have an ionizer placed in our room (to clean the air) and to replace the hair dryer. I wasn't expecting either, but I thought it was a great customer service etiquette. She told us not to go back into our room for 3 hours because the ionizer would be running and they didn't want guests in with the ionizer. We were headed out the strip anyway, so this wasn't a big deal. We returned to the room 4 hours later and the ionizer was in there running. We thought they probably had gotten it in there late, so we left again for another 2 hours. By this point we were ready to go to bed, so we went back to the room....ionizer was still there. I just went in an unplugged the thing. The room smelled much better. Well, for the entire stay, no one ever came back and retrieved the machine. We just placed it in the corner near the door in plain view. It actually became an experiment to see if the housekeeping staff would take it! We never got the hair dryer, which again wasn't that big of a deal because we brought our own. For a five star hotel, I expect to receive the service promised the first time without reasking....so I'm downing this to 4 stars. The room was excellent...couch and beds were all very nice.

But this hotel got me so mad that i decided to share my experience. Let me start with the positives of this hotel. The room was big, spacious and modern. The hotel is relatively new hence its interior is nice and bright. However, that's where it ends. The floor of the bathroom was wet (with water puddles) when we checked in. We brushed it off thinking that its an oversight by the housekeeping. But just as we were about to lie in bed to sleep after a long day, we realised that 2 of the pillow covers were dirty and stained. The duvet was also stained and dirty. As it was already very late, we only complained to the front desk the next morning. They were apologetic and got the houskeeping to clean up the room immediately. Guess what. When we returned to our hotel room in the evening, one of the pillow case still had a stain. However, we were too lazy to make another complaint so we just make do with the rest of the clean pillows. The day before we check out, I dropped my camera in a taxi. I was devastated as all our holiday pictures were inside.The moment we realised that i lost my camera (which is <15mins after being dropped off at Palazzo entrance), we quickly went back to the valet asking for help. Being tourists, my husband and I do not recognise any of the cab companies and definitely do not remember the vehicle no. The valet said they can't do anything and just provide us with 3 taxi companies nos asking us to contact them directly for lost and found. I was panicking as the photos meant a lot to me, so i went to the concierge to see if they can assist in any way. The concierge just shrugged and said that there are more than 40 taxi companies in vegas and it would be impossible to contact every one. I was desperate to get my camera back so i asked if he can provide the nos. He then gave me the Vegas Taxi Authority no. and asked me to call them myself to see if they can help. I called the Taxi Authority and got the list of around 12 taxi companies (thought there were 40?) and started calling all of them myself from the hotel room. After calling all with no results, i decided to call the Taxi Authority again. They suggest that i ask the hotel to check their security camera at the entrance to see if they can see the taxi no. I quickly went down to the hotel security and asked if that can be done. The security just shake his head and say that they can't do it. They will not check the security camera for us no matter what. We then called MGM hotel (cos that's where we took the cab from), told them the whole story and they asked us to go down to the MGM hotel security in person. Once there, the security got us to stand in front of one of the security camera so that they can capture our images and start searching the security camera. Within 2 hours, they called us at Palazzo with the cab company and vehicle no.! We were ecstatic! We called the cab company and the rest is history. The whole irony is that we were staying at Palazzo not MGM. But MGM willingly check the security camera for us w/o hesitation, whereas Palazzo, the hotel we were staying in, totally refused to help (in all aspects!!). This experience left such a bad taste that my husband and I vowed never to stay in the Palazzo again.

I also got the quiche of the day appetizer for $13.50 which was a very large slice of quiche (very tasty) and a salad (came with it) and it was enough for dinner. - Across the street from the \"Fashion Show\" mall which had a Starbucks which was nice for for breakfast. Grab a coffee and pastry or egg sandwich and bring back to the hotel room to eat at the small dining room table with several chairs. The cupcake shop was not open for breakfast. There was a coffee shop that was open, but it was a little less expensive to walk to Starbucks. - Room was a modern, contemporary version of the Venetian suite, but done in pleasant shades of brown and creme as opposed to the red, green and ornate gold of the Venetian. Same big bathroom with large shower, tub, two person sink, toilet area with a door, and the vanity table, padded stool (hairdryer in the drawer). Step-down, sunken living room with a large L-shape couch (almost enough room for both of us to nap on it), desk, mini-bar, and round dining room table with three or four chairs. We had a nice view of the Wynn hotel next door and their pool. - Palazza pool area had about 5 pools and small, square hot tubs. Azure, night club was closed on Tuesday. If you walk to the left, go through the gate, you can walk directly to the Venetian pools and use them too. We stayed there to listen to the loud, pounding music coming from the Tao beach club. It was quiet on the Palazza side and plenty of chairs on Monday and Tuesday. We could charge our drinks back to the Palazzo while enjoying the pools at the Venetian. - We had breakfast at the Canyon Ranch cafe (pool level), and it was very healthy, delicious and came with a side of fresh fruit. - At the Palazzo, we had lunch at the restaurant next to the pool area and it was good and convenient. The Palazzo had the the \"Jersey Boys\" theater while the Venetian had the \"Blue Man\" and Phantom of the Opera theaters. Could use improvement: - Compared the Bellagio and Venetian front desk/lobby areas, the Palazzo wasn't as impressive. They did have a large frosted, nude woman statues in a circle. Behind the front desk, there were fake, tropical plants. I thought they looked tacky and was at first worried what the rest of the hotel was going to look like. When I got to the suite and saw it was exactly like the Venetian but more modern looking, I relaxed.", "Date": "November 13, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Kansas City", "Title": "\u201cBeautiful hotel - definitely recommend\u201d", "Author": "PugsRule", "ReviewID": "UR120550176", "Content": "We stayed three nights last week for my husband's birthday.

I stayed in a standard suite room with a king bed, which by any measure is a big room, especially when there's only one person staying in the room. As described by other people, the room consists of a sleeping area and a sunken living room & workspace. The living room area can easily seat 4 - 6 people in comfort. I've stayed at the Palazzo several times over the years, and the rooms and the furniture all appear to be cleaned and maintained well ... clearly no longer brand new, but no major problems either. The \"cool\" feature is the remote controlled window shades. The bathroom is great. It's a large room, with separate soaking tub and shower stall, a private toilet room, and double sinks. And of course, the required flat screen TV for hotels of this type. (Who watches TV in the bathroom anyway??). Beyond the room, the hotel is a giant self-contained Las Vegas resort. The casino is large, with pretty steep table minimums (I never saw anything less than $15 blackjack tables). There's also decent shopping in the Palazzo as well as the adjoining Canal Shoppes at the Venetian. There's also a Walgreens on the corner, so you don't have to pay $6 for a bottle of water in the lobby gift shop! And there's a bunch of good restaurants and bars (try the champagne cocktails at the Laguna Champagne bar). Frankly, you don't need to leave the hotel, if you don't want to ... and that's a nice option. But if you want to get out and explore, the Mirage and Treasure Island are across the street. The Fashion Show mall, the Wynn, and Caesar's Palace are also all in easy walking distance. Finally, if the $15 table minimums are too high at the Palazzo or the Venetian, you can walk next door to Casino Royale, which is admittedly a dive, but has $5 tables. I always have fun there late into the night. Another good feature ... if you are renting a car, the garage elevator is right next to the hotel elevators ... so you don't have to walk all the way through the casino to get to your room. That's much more convenient than most Vegas hotel parking lots. As for service, check in and check out were uneventful, but not extraordinary.

I called the front desk from the phone at the elevator and they sent security up to let me in which took at most 5minutes. I picked up a new card when I came down later that evening and had no further trouble with it. The room is starting to show a little wear. There are some stains on the granite and dings to the furniture. Nothing was dirty and the room was made up each day with fresh toiletries provided. The bed is very comfortable. Got to watch the TI show from the window at night. Ate at a couple of their restaurants: Dos Caminos- which was okay not great and the Grand Lux which was very nice had an excellent variety to choose from and reasonable prices. Also had room service one evening which arrived a little early(dinner partner still in shower) but everything was hot and enjoyable. It was very crowded in Las Vegas when I was there, more so then the other times this year I have been. I love the high ceilings in the casino it makes the overall appearance very grand and inviting. I think it also helps with the ventilation as smoke didn't seem to be as big as an issue as in other casinos I visited. They have all the newest slot machines and their tables always seemed to be full in the evening. Didn't get to see any show this time around but have seen the Phantom there(very good) and the Blue Man Group( got old after 10min). Prefer the Palazzo over the Venetian as the rooms are newer and seems more elegant on the Palazzo side. I have stayed at the Palazzo 7 times since it opened and never once regretted that decision.

I do admit that our room was one of the more impressive hotel rooms I have ever stayed in, but I would expect it to be so, as it was a suite in a resort. Despite the total lavishness the air conditioning was annoyingly loud and the walls too thin. (Our noisy neighbors woke us up, both nights, very early in the morning.) The walls did not keep out the noise and the vault-heavy door did not prevent sound from entering the room from the hall. The young ladies that assisted us with our check-in were pleasant and efficient, but the young lady who checked us out of the hotel was cold and snobby and gave me the impression that I was beneath her.

I really liked this touch and it was a great fore bearer of what was to come. From the moment we arrived the service at The Palazzo Hotel was exceptional and surprisingly personal for being such a giant hotel. I must commend Intercontinental for partnering with The Palazzo. I was a bit worried about some reviews here, but I have to guess these people are way too attentive to every detail. Yes there was a water stain on the marble, but after a hotel is open for a few years this sort of stuff is going to happen. The maid service was excellent so I don't fault this at all. We were never bothered unless we asked for it and every day we came back our room was immaculate with everything in order and all the extra towels we could want without even asking for them. The rooms are enormous. These are larger than any other similarly priced suite just about anywhere. Having a large bathroom was excellent for when we both wanted to get ready at the same time in the evening. The hotel was exceptional and if it was on it's own I could not list any fault. However, this is part of a large resort and with so many players there are some faults. The restaurants on site are really hit or miss. Cut was outstanding. Like most high end restaurants they called to confirm our reservation, but unlike any restaurant before they asked if either of us were allergic to anything. This was very welcome and ensured that my girlfriend didn't eat anything she couldn't. The service here did not cease to amaze and if you stay at the Palazzo you must eat at Cut. Other restaurants were pretty average and one meal at Tao was slightly below average. If they weren't >$50 a person I wouldn't complain, but at nearly $200 for a simple Asian meal I really expect excellent service. If you're looking for an amazing hotel stay, look no further.

After my fourth trip to either the Palazzo or the Venetian (their rooms are exactly the same, but the Palazzo is a few years newer) I just had to sit down and share my consistently outstanding experiences here. There are often long lines to check in (when you have 7100 rooms, there are a lot of people in and out) but, they move quickly and the front desk staff is friendly, efficient and knowledgeable. They give good directions to the guest elevators (in such a HUGE complex, it is very easy to get lost) so you can find your room. Keep your key envelope with you so you can remember your room numbers ... you might end up with something like 41-836! No \"room 103\" at this hotel! The suites are gorgeous, a large bedroom area and a sunken living room with (hopefully for you) a great view of the Wynn golf course, or the extensive pool areas, or if you're really lucky -- overlooking Las Vegas Blvd and a view of the Treasure Island pirate show and the Mirage Volcano show across the street. The bathrooms are HUUUUGE with a separate shower, bathtub, two sinks and a separate/private room for the toilet. I love the makeup stand with mirrors so you can sit and put on your makeup for the day. I've been very impressed every time I see housekeeping staff on the floor, they always inquire about my suite and if I'm having a good stay. The elevators are typically quick, and they do have express elevator banks for low, mid-tower and high floors so you're not stopping on every floor along the way. Be careful of the mini-bar, it's pressure sensitive and if you take out a snack, it will be put on your bill immediately. The only down side is that they allow smoking in the casino. Maybe some day there will be non-smoking casinos ... one can only hope. I've been to the Venetian and Palazzo for several different reasons: two conventions, one business trip and one personal trip. Every experience was outstanding. I could not have asked for anything more. Our conventions (with 7000+ attendees) were executed flawlessly. The banquet staffs greeted us by name as we were going through buffet lines (yes, we were wearing conference badges ... but they NOTICED and USED our names!) They do have an extensive pool area, the Canyon Ranch Spa and a huge fitness center, none of which I have had time to use while I've been there. I usually go for a run out on Las Vegas Blvd. in the mornings before it gets busy instead of paying the $17+ \"resort fee\" which includes access to the fitness center and wi-fi in the room. If you're going to use the gym or the wi-fi, it's worth signing up for the resort fee. Access to the gym is $40/day a la carte and wi-fi is $12.95/day. They have some INCREDIBLE restaurants in the hotel complex, many with celebrity chefs such as Emeril Lagasse (Delmonico's steaks, Table 10 or Lagasse Sports Book), Mario Batali, Thomas Keller, Wolfgang Puck. Or more casual fare. The Canal Shoppes offer some high end shopping ... you can easily spend your winnings right there! I wish there was a Starbucks in the complex, but there are only Coffee Bean and Tea Leaf cafe's instead. But, walk across the street, there is a Starbucks right on the corner across from the Palazzo entrance. I love the change of the seasons in their decor near the fountain and the staff is always warm and welcoming. Elegance, indulgence, sophistication.

Liked the lounge chairs placed right in the shallow end of the pool and the guys passing out cold cucumber slices and popsicles. The bar staff seemed a little overwhelmed both days I went to the pool, but it was a 85 degrees and slammed. But they still made me my favorite frozen mojito in fairly short order. The pool bar is bigger and nicer at the Venetian. They have a shaded area with sports on tv there and and about three times as many stools. Got a complimentary upgrade just by asking -just a better view and higher floor. Possibly because we were registered as 'Grazie' members. Sign up on the hotel site and become Grazie members before you arrive. It's the player's card site. You check in at a special desk. I have also stayed at the Venezia tower in the Venetian. Very nice, but a bit of a hike from other parts of the hotel complex. You have access to a small private pool and are very near Bouchon (the restaurant) for breakfast. We had a late check out for our 7 p.m. flight , so we headed down to the pool for the afternoon our last day. There is no private shower area at the Palozzo pool, but Palozzo guests have access to the Venetian pool, which does. Or for $20 you can get a day pass to the Canyon Ranch Spa and use their facilities. Had planned to eat at Cut steakhouse in the hotel, but when we showed up for our 7:30 reservation on a Friday night, it was just too raucous. Really a loud scene. Suited for a younger diner. (We are in our fifties.) The concierge booked us a table at Charlie Palmer's, which we loved. I had a fabulous doggie bag from Charlie Palmer's Steakhouse (in the Four Seasons). Bought a gorgeous loaf of bread from the Bouchon Bakery in the Venetian and made scrumptious steak sandwiches poolside the next day. The bellman fixed me up a little cooler bag when he came up to get our bags to put into storage. Would never hesitate to stay at either the Palozzo or Venetian again. It's true they have no fridge or coffeemaker. I just fill up a plastic dry cleaning bag that they provide and put my doggie bags in there. Bring a few big zip lock bags in your luggage or a soft sided cooler that will pack easily. Room service is great. Or jump on the elevator and right outside is a Starbuck's type place. There is always a line there in the early morning, so just keep going a door or two down to Cafe Presse. I sometimes sent my early bird husband down to the Bouchon Bakery at the Venetian to pick up the really good ham and cheese croissant for me and the chocolate almond croissant for him. They always sell out of the ham and cheese early. It has about 20 paper thin slices of a French ham with a lovely cheese. Really good fresh squeezed juice there too. Also, don't miss the lobster club sandwich at Postria-in the Venetian, too. My husband's was bummed out that his favorite Vegas sports book at the Venetian was being remodeled during our stay.

The greatest asset would clearly be the rooms as their all -suite spaciousness, furniture (sunken sitting area), bathrooms and amenities make these the best rooms in which I have stayed in LV - just edging out WynnLVs I would say. Of course the restaurants are world class- Luxe is great for your normal expansive BLD menu. We also ate at Cut for dinner which was awesome. Jersey Boys was very enjoyable also. Public areas very clean and manicured. So you can't really go wrong staying here. On negative that is personal preference, I don't care for the high ceiling, convention-hall-like casinos like the one at the Palazzo and similar to Mandaly Bay, MGM, Caesars, PH - much preferring the softer and more comfortable feeling of Wynn, Bellagio. I mostly walked over to the Venetian casino(not a short walk) to gamble because of this. One gets the feeling of being more in a sprawling complex at Venetian/Palazzo versus some others.

The other high ranking hotel that we've stayed at is the Encore. We've stayed at the Luxor, The Hotel @ Mandalay Bay, Encore, Excalibur, MGM, and this property is so nice compared to the others. The Encore is a bit more luxurious though. Our suite at the Palazzo was about 1200 sq feet. View was okay (didn't get a full strip view) but the amenities made up for it. The room service (we ordered in several meals) is wonderful. Large menu to choose from. The suite we stayed in was clean & spacious, comfortable bed, wonderful shower with multiple heads. Large bathrooms (2 of them!) with three tv's in the suite. Satellite functioned a little slowly with the tv remote but not a big deal. Casino in Palazzo is great--not huge but good table games & slot options are good. Drinks are made well here-not watered down. Grazie desk is great--they treat you quite well is you play in their casino! Beautiful decor throughout. Again, we've been to Vegas many times and this hotel ranks high on our list. The Encore provides higher quality towels and robes---which probably doesn't matter to men too much but I totally appreciate things like that. Encore did cost us a lot more for a smaller quite (600 sq feet) so for the money the Palazzo is a better deal. But if money isn't an issue and you want pure opulence then go with the Encore. If space & a more varied crowd appeal to you then go with Palazzo. A regular Encore suite is not ideal for bachelor or bachelorette parties whereas the large Palazzo suites are perfect for them. The service at both hotels is wonderful. Upgrading at the Palazzo to a larger suite was a great move. The breakfast buffet at the Grand Lux in the Palazzo is great--simple & tasty. Where as the Encore/Wynn buffet serves a much larger selection of foods from around the world---broader pallets would lean this way. The Palazzo suite bathroom (could fit up to 4 people getting ready if needed) has multi shower heads that are phenomenal!! TV above mirror, deep tub and stand alone shower. Small seperate vanity area with mirror is so great for doing makeup. The Encore bathroom was smaller (great for 2 people) but still very nice with a TV as well--much nicer thead count for the towels here.

We had originally booked 2 Bella Suites in the Venetian. No lines, and it didn't take too long to deal with the details. A big conference was in town so they were full - two of us had to stay in the Palazzo which was apparently a $100/night upgrade but it was the same room type. As the other reviews suggest, this place is huge. It took us quite a while to find our way from the Venetian main lobby, through the Venetian casino, through the Palazzo atrium, through the Palazzo casino, then to the guest elevators. Even when you know where you're going, it's a long walk back and forth - heads up. This is pretty much the same thing if you're one level up and walking through the canal shoppes between the 2 hotels. Our (Palazzo) room was nice - more of a modern decor than the Venetian, but still pretty luxurious and over the top. The beds were comfy and we slept well. There wasn't a lot of noise from the hallways at night to prevent us from sleeping, which was nice. I'm not sure if that was a good fluke or is indicative of the type of guests that typically book this hotel - I didn't see a lot of really young partiers, I would say it was generally a more mature crowd (late 20's and up). There were a few details about the room that made me wonder how well this place is holding up or will hold up in the future. The bathroom counter and the top of the room partition is marble, which have both seen better days in terms of water stains/marks. The lighted makeup mirror didn't work, there was a dirty sock from a previous guest that was under the mattress pad/protector, the coffee table in the living room area was very sticky. I know these can be fixed but I believe that months and years of sub-par cleaning and maintenance add up quickly in a hotel. Requests for extra glasses and a few extra items were dealt with quickly by staff. Overall, the rooms were nicely done, well-appointed and comfortable. We had a look at the Venetian room, and it was similar - same layout, but more over the top in terms of slightly gaudy decor. The casino was pretty good - I played quite a few slots as well as some roulette. It was smoky but not any more than any of the other casinos, and it was as bright as a large room underground can realistically be. I had a massage and checked out the spa facilities one day. They were 'ok'. My massage was also 'ok'. The halls between the treatment rooms and the common areas are pretty bad - dimly lit, in dark carpet and walls (it could have been a hospital, very sterile). The 'salt grotto' is a nice attempt, but it reminds me of one of those stretch limos with the starry lights on the ceiling that switch colours. Really dated. The whirlpool has a few 'dark' areas in it that I'm concerned about in terms of mildew, and the chlorine smell from it stuck to me for a couple of days, despite trying to scrub it off in numerous showers. The sauna is similar to the grotto - changing lights, mosaic tiles that are dated in terms of colours with patches of them that have seen better days. I called the Encore the next morning and headed over there for another massage and spa experience - it was like night and day, absolutely no comparison. Overall - the Palazzo (and by extension the Venetian) were nice. However, the whole complex was a bit too big for my liking, the spa was disappointing, and it was a bit over the top in terms of crazy decor when it should have been over the top in a classic kind of way. I don't know how to explain it, but I guess that I expected more given the level of effort that has gone into this place in terms of making this place distinctive and a destination in its own right. I have stayed at the Encore and I found myself comparing the Palazzo/Venetian to the Wynn/Encore throughout my stay and found that the Wynn/Encore came out on top in pretty much every aspect. They can be similar in price (depending on what you book) so given that they are right next to each other, I would go next door the next time I'm there.", "Date": "October 10, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Wellington, New Zealand", "Title": "\u201cExcellent!\u201d", "Author": "SuiteG7", "ReviewID": "UR119116946", "Content": "My partner and I stayed at the Palazzo for 2 nights and LOVED it.

The rooms were spacious (though we spent little time in them) and the bathroom was HUGE (comfortably accomodating 3 women and all our stuff. We realized once we stayed there we easily could have fit all 6 of us in one suite because the Palazzo has pull out beds in the couch. But we were happy to have the extra space. The price on the rooms were very reasonable as well. We did not upgrade to the Prestige, although the staff strongly recommended it. We were perfectly fine without it, although I cannot say we would not have enjoyed the amenities that were offered.

Stepping into the hotel was like entering Grand Central Station at peak hour! But that is the norm in Vegas, as I discovered later, except if you go to the Mandarin Oriental which is apparently the only human-size hotel without a casino attached... but not the same rates of course... I won't write an essay about the hotel, as Vegas is really not the sort of destination I would recommend. But if you feel like going, The Palazzo is not a bad choice, from a value-for-money point of view. The room was extremely spacious and very clean. The hotel's common areas were also immaculate, and the property has got tons of restaurants and cafes to try out, so you could literally spend your entire time in ther... if you don't die of claustrophobia after an hour that is... If you like gambling the casino at The Palazzo seemed like a popular venue, but if you don't play, like me, crossing the casino area with its foul smell of cold tobacco and rose flower deodoriser will be a chore every time... But this is not just proper to the Palazzo... Every single big hotel in town will feel the same... Like most places in Vegas, the hotel was a clash of two worlds: super rich frolicking at the overly crowded pool with barely legal teenagers, a club that was playing loud rap music with gorgeous girls trying to find the rhythm and the fun in it, bad drinks at the bar but gorgeous food at the Grand Lux Cafe and Le Bouchon restaurants... Something maybe worth experiencing once in a lifetime but two nights would be enough: one afternoon to visit all the hotels and casinos, a show in the evening (Cirque du Soleil \"O\" was great, Celine Dion could have been fab but she is only back in December 2011) and the Grand Canyon the next day and that's you done for life... And to have a good restful sleep, The Palazzo is a good solid choice... One final admin point: all hotels in Vegas add a resort fee to your booking (covering pool and gym access, as well as wifi), but I don't remember reading this on expedia when I booked. I managed to get away without paying the fee (70USD a day...), after complaining that my bookings on expedia had been paid for in its entirety and should have included these extra fees. Worth also double checking your final bill: mine had a few extra expenses which i never signed for...

My bags were quickly brought to my room and I must mention the young man who took them before check in was another great asset- using my name with a smile and the first to welcome me to the Palazzo. The room was very spacious and luxurious- see photos. During my stay I encountered Blanca who brought me room service and went out of her way to ask if there is anything else I may need. Also, you will notice security at every level which is quite comforting especially as a single female traveler. The piece de restistance for me however was the spa. I took advantage of the flyer in the room and booked a 30 minute treatment as a few days of Vegas will quickly take its toll- and it was the best part of my entire trip!!! I was lucky enough to get Marcella as my therapist who must have removed 10 years of stress from my shoulders I didn't even realize I had been carrying.

If you are looking for a great room this is the place. If you are looking for an overall great environment, this is NOT the place. This is a smoking establishment, so unless you are a smoker (I am not) the place is rather stinky - I know that it is a supposed myth that oxygen is pumped into hotels that have a casino to keep patrons awake, so I can only attribute my difficulties with sleep to poor air quality due to smoke/ventilation (was at the Trump a few months earlier and loved the air quality and the sleep - the room amenities were better as well there, but the rooms were not as luxurious). The beds and bedding are wonderful and I had no complaints on that front. Water takes time to heat up on the upper floors (we were on 46), so don't expect hot water in the morning - not even lukewarm. Room noise was minimal, no problems with noise from outside filtering in, but for some reason noise from adjacent room showers was very loud (hey I like to shower as soon as I get back to my room regardless of the hour...I felt sorry for my neighbours, but they returned the favour at 7 am). The whole mini fridge being weighted was absolutely ridiculous. Thankfully I knew about this before I got there, called down to confirm and ask if an exception could be made so that we could store water and were told that the purpose of the fridge was not for the convenience/use of the room guests (really? I was paying enough for the room to hope that I would be able to store some water bottles to combat the 40 degree (celsius) weather - the hotel sees it clearly as another cash grab over and above the \"resort fee\" - water was $6 from the fridge and you would have to be a lunatic to buy it. Walgreens is just outside if you don't mind the walk. We were sent up a second \"mini\" ice bucket instead...pathetic!). I DID NOT even bother to open the fridge (the phone call took care of that), but when it came time to check out, surprise surprise, over $25 in refreshment charges. No arguments with removing the charges when I called to dispute, so I would check the bill carefully. I was expecting the resort fee, so no surprises with the almost $19 (including taxes)/day that was applied. While this is a \"luxury\" hotel, given it's size there is no way that it's staff can provide \"luxury\" service (stay at the Four Seasons if that is important to you - they are exceptional). Wait times for everything including lengthy delays in answering phones, less than helpful service, housekeeping was at the door EARLY every morning (8:30 am including day of checkout which was a real surprise), so put your do not disturb sign out if you mind being woken up. Housekeeping did do a really good job though. I actually liked the location, on the strip but not right in the middle of lunacy, the parking garage always had spots available where it was convenient. Casino was busy, but not a mad zoo. A general mix of people, but on the whole I would say a slightly older crowd. Gym was well equipped but crowded even early. I don't think I will be staying here again, but it all depends on what you want in a hotel. Personally I think there are better options out there and I am beginning to realize that while I enjoy the craziness away from my \"home\" hotel, I like coming back to a place that is a little less crazy and whole lot cleaner air-wise.", "Date": "October 4, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Huntington Beach, California", "Title": "\u201cLoved the decor\u201d", "Author": "iam2mai", "ReviewID": "UR118914498", "Content": "This hotel was elegant, well kept and beautifully decorated.

We sometimes stay in the south tower at the Wynn but the room rates are normally twice as much as Palazzo unless you catch a good deal on the internet.

It seems, however, in Vegas there are many. The rooms are very large and the staff were mostly pretty pleasant and professional. My main complaint is a couple of incidents where I felt I wasn't treated with the courtesy I expect at a top end hotel. The first time was when I was walking back to the elevator that goes up to the guest suites. The security guard shouted at me as I walked by him. \"SIR, SHOW ME YOUR ROOM CARD!\" Wow, it felt like I was a criminal or something. So I showed it to him and apologized, saying that they didn't check it last time. I then asked him, out of pure curiosity and with no attitude whatsoever, why they seem so strict about it sometimes and other times people just walk right through to the elevator. To me it seems this system doesn't really provide much security, but inconveniences guests. His response was very confrontational saying \"you can try to get past me... you can try.\" I know he's a security guard and not a guest relations guy, but the hotel should realize that at 4am he is the face of the hotel and should be provided some soft skills training. On another occasion I called the front desk for a late checkout request and wakeup call and the gentleman on the phone was very short with me, so much so that I would call it unprofessional. Again, not what I expect when I go \"5 star.\" The casino dealers aren't nearly as friendly as many of the other casinos we played in. When you tip them, they hardly acknowledge it, and they don't smile a lot. To be fair, some were great, but overall it seemed like they are jaded union workers or something. The pool area was very nice. The suites are big and nice. We tipped at check in and got upgraded to a strip view and given comped phantom tickets (cool show, but glad i didn't pay). I will probably try another hotel next time. The Venetian seemed to have a bit more character and classic 5 star feel. There are so many choices, I don't see why I'd stick with Palazzo, unless I got a really great deal next time.", "Date": "September 22, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Farmington CT", "Title": "\u201cLoved it!\u201d", "Author": "alilace", "ReviewID": "UR118431993", "Content": "This place was amazing!

The casino had a \"smoke free\" corridor. The details of the artwork on the walls, the floral arrangements showed a leval of care I don't see too often. The glass doors at the main entrance were always clean. The tile floor was always polished. The carpet in the casino was always clean and showed no wear. All in all, the Palazzo was a joy to stay at.

Not to my surprise I was told my room was not yet ready so I decided to check my emails and get some work done in their lounge while sipping on the complimentary champagne. I hadn't finished that glass of bubbly before I received a call that my room was ready. The room was just as I remembered it and was no different on the Prestige Level although they did give me a strip view which was nice. The room was clean and serviced well each day by housekeeping. Service in the lounge was excellent with the waitress checking on your drinks and refilling as soon as she sees you are getting near the bottom and they do pour a stiff Manhattan. No watered down drinks here and no limit that I could see. The food offerings were adequate, fresh and palatable but nothing extravagent and certainly nothing on par to the Club Level at the Ritz Carlton. They also have 4 computers and printer in their business centre located off the lounge that is also complimentary. All in all, I had a wonderful stay and would not hesitate to recommend the Palazzo to others. I would only stay on the Prestige Level again if I could snag another discounted rate( under $250.00) and /or my husband accompanied me as it certainly is not worth the $450.00 plus price tag they were selling it at on their website during my stay for a solo.", "Date": "September 21, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "avalon1025", "Title": "\u201cGreat Vegas Hotel\u201d", "Author": "avalon1025", "ReviewID": "UR118382108", "Content": "Have stayed at Belagio, Wynn and Aria and this was my first stay at Palazzo.

As with most of the larger hotels in Vegas, there is a long walk from reception through the casino, to bedrooms. These were minor downsides in what was a fantastic 4 night stay. We didn\u2019t bother upgrading from the standard luxury suite (more than adequate for the time that we intended to spend in it) but we did ask for a quiet room on a higher floor (we got the 45th). It was large, modern, well-maintained and the bathroom had lots of nice toiletries. Our only gripe is that we would have liked coffee making equipment especially as room service could be a little slow. Loads of choice for breakfast in the Grand Luxe. We had lunch in the Dal Toro, Riva and Canyon Ranch Grill. Food quality in all the hotel restaurants was good but service was a bit mixed (for example on two occasions we had trouble charging meals to our room account until we involved the restaurant manager ). We were disappointed that there was no water in the Grand Canal due to maintenance work - unfortunate timing. Although we were really happy with the hotel. next time we would probably stay at the Bellagio as this is more central and we spent most of our time around that location. We had dinner one night at the Paris Eiffel Tower restaurant -good food and service and some tables have fabulous views overlooking the Bellagio fountains (we booked well in advance). We really enjoyed our dinner at Bellagio\u2019s Le Cirque - fantastic food and service and intimate ambience. But our clear favourite was Joel Robuchon - outstanding even by Michelin star standards. We took two trips to the Grand Canyon with Maverick which offered very different experiences so I would definitely recommend doing both if you have the time and the money. I we had to choose between the two our favourite was the Indian Territory tour to the West Rim - not just because we were allocated front seats but also because Matt (our pilot) couldn\u2019t have done more to try and make this a really personal and memorable experience. A good mix of low flying, Canyon landing and time to Skywalk. On the Canyon Dream tour, the jet journey to the South Rim didn\u2019t offer any spectacular views. The heli part of the tour was shorter than at the West Rim but more dramatic. Maverick tell you that they have the best helicopters and that you will have good views in the back seats as these are raised so you can see over the top of the people in front. This is not true. The pilot allocates specific seats based on weight and the lightest couple will go in the front. We had fantastic views from the front seats; you are OK in the back if you have a window seat; but on our second trip I had a middle seat in the back and could not see over the tall gentleman sitting in front of me. This was also part of the reason that we were disappointed with the personal video of the trip which we bought \u2013 the internal camera was focused on one side of the helicopter (I didn\u2019t feature at all and there were only a couple of glimpses of my husband).

We used a free night certificate and booked a weekend trip. It was apparent they were still learning the Royal Ambassador ropes, but everything was handled fine in the end. When we attempted to turn in the certificate, they were a bit confused about what it was. Apparently the computer system simply lists those nights as comped. (We probably could have kept the cert to use another time, but did not.) We had lounge access with our auto-upgraded room, but there was also a separate RA lounge in the lobby with private check-in. The RA lounge was usually empty, with plenty of seating, great service (24-hour butler to mix drinks), finger foods (sandwiches, nuts, sliced cheeses), water and tea available at all times. The Prestige lounge on the 23rd floor, on the other hand, was crowded and noisy. It's HUGE and provided the more common lounge services like breakfast (with hot foods), happy hour and various light snacks at different times of the day.

Of course, with Hotwire you save money by choosing what you want in a hotel and not knowing the hotel name until you book it, but this was a gamble that ended up paying off. The Palazzo is an elegant hotel located right in the nice part of the Strip next to the Venetian and across from the Wynn. Check in did not take long at all, and we were informed that we could upgrade to a higher floor in the \"Prestige level\" for an extra $100/night. This includes the resort fee and breakfast until 10AM each morning and cocktails/beer later in the day with some snacks.

We checked out TI, Mirage and Wynn...but just couldn't beat the proximity to Sands Expo. We arrived 2 days early and left a day later than the convention to have a little \"us\" time, wish it could have been longer. We checked in Aug 26, around 2pm. There was no line at the registration desk and the clerk was very friendly. We had requested a King Suite (just the basic) for 8 days and it was already available for check-in. Our room was 38-709, facing the Wynn Golf Course. You do have to have your room key ready each time you head to the elevators on the first and second floor for the guards, I loved that aspect! The elevators are very quick, even when your heading downstairs, our waits were pretty short each time we were at the elevator, which was fantastic. I really liked that the elevator bays are split by floor groupings, I think that really helps cut down on your wait time. Our room was in pretty good shape, you could tell it had seen better days. One thing we loved was the safe, it's a full sized drawer in the cabinet under the TV. We were able to put so much in the safe, we had multiple laptops, cell phones, tablet computers (can you tell he's a techie?), plus the normal money, jewelry and etc that you might put into the safe. I was even able to put my purse (flattened and pretty empty) in there with it full and the drawer still close. What a nice change from the tiny safes in the wall that are at most hotels. The bed was very comfortable, it comes with only 3 pillows, and frankly it's like there's no pillow at all. We ended up requesting 2 additional pillows from the housekeeper (on day 2, with a $5 tip) and she gave us an additional three pillows, and one randomly showed up later in our stay. We really appreciated her help with that (we tipped her $5 each day, she was exceptional). The sunken living room was a lifesaver since we were in town so long, it was great to stretch out on with the TV (and they have better TV here than we've had at any other hotel). The desk area was great, they had a power strip as well, which was so handy for all of our charging cords of the various devices. There was a scanner/copier in the room, we did use it once and it worked like a charm. I do wish it were a wireless printer, that would be the ultimate! There was a 5 piece dining set also in the sunken living room, it was a good spot for a pizza box and then when we were packing, but other than that, we didn't use it much. The ledge that divides the room ended up being a big catch all for our bags and purchases, perfect height and just handy. We enjoyed the larger closet, I just wish they'd give more hangers, especially when you're there for so long. I might have been able to request more, but I didn't really think about it. Luckily I had some additional hangers from the garment bag that worked out, as well as the hangers for the robes. We used the iron and ironing board quite a bit, both worked perfectly. They did offer laundry services (even same day), but we did not use. The bathroom was very nice, double sinks are always appreciated. The separate vanity area was nice, but the make-up mirror light did not work. The hair dryer was in the drawer and worked like a charm. No jets in the tub (bummer), so it was not used. The shower was a good size and leaking from the bottom of the door wasn't too bad, the bath rug was able to handle it. Throughout the room, we really liked the different lighting that was available. Plus there were a ton of mirrors, so there was always one handy. But the lighting choices were great, the lamp on the right side of the bed did not work after the first night, but it was never a problem. We ate at the Grand Lux Cafe quite a bit (well me, almost every day), and we enjoyed the Palazzo location more than the Venetian location. Palazzo was a bit quieter, while Venetian was very loud and it was difficult to hear all 4 people at the table. Great food all the time, this had to be one of the most consistent restaurants in Vegas I've ever been to. I'd highly recommend to anyone looking for a good breakfast spot. We also dined at Lavo for our anniversary dinner, I made reservations for 5pm on Thurs (not needed, but still made them on open table, handy!). Dinner was fantastic, hubby had a steak and I had cheese ravioli, we shared a meatball (to die for!). With two rounds of drinks from the bar (a mix of wine and top shelf), our bill came to $180. If we're in the area again, we'd go back. Gambling was fine, we broke even. The casino floor was busy in the evenings, but during the morning time, you wouldn't have any trouble getting in on the game you wanted to play. The shopping area of the Grand Canal Shoppes was lovely, a window-shoppers paradise! There is a food court with many economical choices, we dined there a few times. Once you figure your way around, you can get anywhere in a decent amount of time. Again, don't forget your room card at the elevators, even from the shopping level. I was also able to spend an afternoon at the Fashion Show Mall, it was so nice to be able to walk to! Just across two pedestrian bridges, it was so handy! They have great shopping there, it's usually not too crowded, so I highly recommend to anyone who might be looking for the shops that aren't available in their area. After all that being said, here was the downside for us. This is at the north-end of the Strip, a good location to many hotels, restaurants and clubs. Also, we were there over a weekend (which is rare for us). Due to these two things, this is not our favorite location. We're not there to party, we're there on vacation and relax. While our room was very relaxing, at night, the casino level is very busy and very fast. We just didn't feel comfortable here. Too many partiers, too many people carrying their booze back from Walgreens on the corner (though very handy, and reasonably priced!), just too much everything. Plus, we paid a very steep nightly charge, and that just bugged me. Our rate was $219 per night, and while I know a lot of people probably paid more that week, that was just too much for a 7 night stay. If I could move this hotel down to the south end of the Strip, it would be the ultimate and give TheHotel a run for its money. But since it's at the north end of the Strip, I doubt we'll ever stay here again (unless for another convention, it's proximity to Sands Expo was bar-none).

It is certainly nice to look at and the rooms are nice 2 room suites. The people are nice, but don\u2019t expect great-great service unless you pay for it. (it is Vegas after all \u2013 it is expensive \u2013 and nothing is free) }First Impression from the outside \u2013 [above average] \u2013 I have been to Vegas several times, so I am familiar with the strip, off strip, & downtown. It changes every time I go back. The outside of the Palazzo/Venetian is very nice \u2013 made to look like Italy. It looks like a quality place. }First Impressions of the lobby \u2013 [above average] \u2013 It is nicely decorated and large. It is known for its decorations. }First Impressions of the room \u2013 [above average] \u2013 Luxury Suite (this is the basic king room) I picked this hotel to impress my wife on her first trip to Las Vegas. The room is large (2rm suite). You walk in past the large bathroom, to the bed area. Then there is another stepped down area with a large L couch, desk, and a table with 4 chairs. It is nice. It is just like the pictures on their web site. The drapes and sheer are automatic \u2013 via a remote control. Items in the room \u2013 safe, 2 main TVs and a TV in the bathroom, ice down the hall, iron and ironing board, wifi Some items are NOT there \u2013 refrig (there is one for the mini bar, but if you even move an item (to make space) it will charge you \u2013 so no refrig, AND no coffee maker. }Room \u2013 The Bathroom \u2013 [above average] - It is what you would expect from this level of hotel. Nice. Just like the photos. And it has 2 lighting options. One full-on set of lights for day (one switch), and a very nice fully dimmable (down to candle level) on a few other light fixtures for night. (this makes a nice night light) It also has a nice place to sit with a high magnification lighted mirror \u2013 my wife loved this for putting on makeup. There was a hair dryer. }Room \u2013 The Bed \u2013 [average] \u2013 a nice king. Firm, but not bad. Slept fine. Wife slept fine. The lights on the side of the bed are a bit tricky to reach. (there is one switch for the main bedroom lights and then if you really look, another push button for the lights over each night stand) }Noise \u2013 [average] \u2013 like most mega hotels, you will hear your neighbors door open/close AND any noise in the hallway as people walk by. And if you neighbor is watching TV loudly or having a gathering \u2013 you will hear it. Also, there was a click, click, click,\u2026. from the AC unit after it ran. This went on for a while \u2013 woke me up once. But it only did this the first night. }Heat/Cool \u2013 [above average] \u2013 It has a full digital thermometer. Allows you to set the temp, heat/cool, and the fan speed (hi/med/low) \u2013 (and it wanted \u2013 fan only). And it does not blow air direct on the bed (which is a nice design). So no drafts on your face while you sleep. }Service \u2013 Housekeeping \u2013 [average] \u2013 they did a good job and did not miss anything. Never intruded. I would call when we left the room (as we got a late start most days) }Service \u2013 Front desk and Concierge \u2013 [average] \u2013 We did check-in at the front desk. It is large and rather impersonal desk, but the girl helping us was nice. Calling the front desk from the room is rather hit or miss. They have any automated system to route your request, but half the time if just went dead, and the other half it would play music on hold without any explanation \u2013and then finally connect me to a person (who may or may not be able to help me directly). We tried the concierge desk twice. Once at check-in to see about phantom ticket (DON\u2019T bother \u2013 they just sell them at full price \u2013 check the discount codes online \u2013and go the Phantom box office and ask for the discounts). And once again, on the way out to ask about mailing some post cards \u2013and the location/directions to the nearest post office. She told us the front desk does sell the international post card stamps. (but this has been an issue for us in the past \u2013 mail not getting out of a hotel \u2013 so we tend to go to a post office) They gave us a google map search print-out. (not really any help with directions from the hotel \u2013 just the print out) }Service \u2013 Food \u2013 [NA] \u2013 We did not order room service, and there is NOT any type of included/free food. (I would not expect any in Vegas) }Service \u2013 overall attitude from mgmt through to the staff \u2013 [average] \u2013 If you are not a big spender, don\u2019t expect anything above the average service. Everyone was nice, but cash rules in Vegas. }Little Extras \u2013 [average] \u2013 ) There is a fax machine in the room. ) There are 2 robes to use while visiting in the room. (we did not use them) ) Free self park }Other Notes \u2013 ) You must walk through the Casino to reach the room elevators from the front desk, and it is smoky. (just like most other Casino/Hotels in Vegas) The Palazzo has signs saying it is a \u201csmoke free corridor\u201d \u2013 but don\u2019t believe it. (most casinos are smoky, but this one seems a bit more than the others) After you check in, you can come down from the rooms to level 2 \u2013 to avoid the casino if you are going to the shops/canals. But if you want to reach the garage or front desk \u2013 smoke will be an issue. ) GET ON THE GRAZIE e-mail list \u2013 this has the best room deals (if you are not a comp\u2019ed gambler) ) DON\u2019T bother using the concierge for show tickets \u2013 they just sell them at full price \u2013 check the discount codes online \u2013and go the show box office and ask for the discounts. }Would I stay there again? \u2013 Yes }Would I recommend this place to a friend? \u2013 Yes", "Date": "September 8, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cGreat for the price\u201d", "Author": "Ninibean", "ReviewID": "UR117833909", "Content": "This was our first time at this hotel.

We have a noticed a distinct reduction in the service and atmosphere in the concierge lounges, and an increase in the number of people allowed in. Last year at the Palazzo was the worst: the first evening, we stood in a line-up for 25 minutes to get a glass of wine, by which time all the food was picked over, and all the tables claimed. There were large groups of people who looked like they just arrived from the pool wearing swimsuits, tank tops, and flip-flops, despite the sign clearly asking for proper attire. Breakfasts were worse: families treated the lounge like an all-you-can-eat buffet, with kids sitting on the floor and food spread out on the coffee tables. The noise level, and overworked staff who could not keep up with the trash and dirty dishes, made for a totally unpleasant experience. Worse, I wrote a long letter to the head of the concierge lounge expressing our concerns in a respectful manner and making suggestions for improving the experience, but never received a reply. This year, we chose to return to the Palazzo, but not the concierge level. The room was great as always, and we chose to buy our food and beverages off-site.

To me, an Ambassador is someone who represents the Hotel with the most outstanding perception that anyone can give, who projects positive feelings out, and says... I represent this Hotel as the Ambassador and I'm proud of it. I must say that this didn't happen with \"Jessica\" as I have found out her name to be. I wanted to make a GREAT comment about the hotel checkout process, she was standing right next to me, as I was in line. I tapped her on the shoulder with a finger to get her attention. She turned around and told me, snapping at me, \"Don't you ever touch me again!\". In my mind, I said.... WOW, Lady, what's up with you, did you get off the wrong side of the bed this morning, or did you not get any \"yum yum\" last night. Regardless her situation, her behaviour was totally uncalled for. That upset me so very much that as I was finally checking out, I told the person behind the counter my experience, I was in tears because of it. She referred me to manager who came up and I explained the situation. She said that there will be a followup on this.

With bags in tow, plus kids, and watching guest after guest being checked in, I seriously had to wonder what was going on. Was I really to believe every guest checking in wanted a smoking room? Bottom line, I had to go up twice (after already having waited the hour), until I had to politely insist/beg that they make something happen for me room-wise. It's as if they have no contact with the people cleaning the rooms, and continue checking guests in without any system to take care of the people waiting. I asked if they would kindly give me one of the coupons for one of their restaurants (they usually give them to you when you check in, or have them in your room) so we could kill the time there while the room is cleaned. But NO, apparently their computer system only prints them out on check in, so they could not make a (seemingly) simple request like that happen. If the people on the front-lines are not empowered to provide a good customer service experience, and are just cashiers, you might as well close your doors for business. There are plenty of hotels in Vegas that show grace under pressure and provide a good customer experience, even during peak times. I still give it one star for having large comfortable rooms with great sheets. The space is really ideal for a family, but perhaps (is it possible) that the Venetian has their act a bit more together?

Had to call 3 times, waiting 1 and 1/2 hours the first time, 30 minutes the second time, etc. Staff personality very nice, but just slow service concerning the room. We had a double queen suite and was very comfortable size, although the beds were okay, they certainly were not \"heavenly\". Linens good though. Very mediocre and basic toiletries. No exhaust fan in the enclosed toilet area or in the shower area. Nice to have separate tvs in bed area, living area, and bathroom. Nice motorized drapery system. Keep in mind that double queen suites are at end of the hall. The casino was very blaugh in decor, but with high ceilings, the smoke was less noticeable. Sometimes we were lucky to find $10 game tables, sometimes $15. The norm was $25. The plus is there is a short connecting indoor walk between Palazzo and Venetian casinos, so you have two casinos to play in and charges and \"Grazie\" points can be applied to your account in both casinos. Both casinos have huge amount of penny slots, but with max bet being as high as 2 or 3 dollars a pull on most of them. The big plus of the whole experience was the Grand Lux Cafe, available in both the Palazzo and the Venetian. We ate every meal there because everything we tried there was so yummy good and the prices were reasonable, especially with the huge portions that are served. Everything was served hot and fresh. My husband loved the ribs (huge full slab). I loved the Asian Chicken Salad, the fried Shrimp, and we both loved the Salisbury Steak -- must have been almost a pound of meat each, the fresh bread, the homemade lemonade, the crusty apple pie, -- yum yummy stuff. Our average dinner bill was $42 without alcohol, not including tip. The Jersey Boys show was absolutely fabulous and so entertaining. Beware however that the very large and loud speakers are located on each end of stage, so front orchestra seats close to stage on each side will absolutely leave you deaf when you leave. We had inner aisle seats halfway back in front orchestra and were very pleased, row Q seats 14 and 15. Also because of the raised stage, I think best seats would be about 10 to 12 rows back in center as well as inner seats of front orchestras.

The view, the bed, the large sofa, the 3TV's - in the living room, bedroom and in the bathroom. The bathroom was just as fabulous with bath, separate shower, two 'his and hers' basins and a toilet cubicle. It was very modern and up to date. I particularly liked the remote control for the blinds and curtains!! The service in the hotel was very good. We ordered breakfast one morning and it arrived very quickly and the food was delicious...I loved the sausages! We didn't really use the mini bar but it had a good selection. The hotel is perfectly located on the strip and we felt we were in the middle of all the action.

He was looking at guests not even helping since he was too busy gossiping with other colleagues. The guests were so upset and left. When I ordered my drinks, while I was playing $1 poker machine, he made a big deal making my martini with Grey goose. And he was very rude to me. A minute later, my girlfriend had the same experience with him. We have never went back to the bar there during our stay. Next day, I was at the bar close to the registration there, everyone was so nice and receptive to all guests, even though they were very busy. I spoke to one of the guests at the bar, and the gentleman from New York told me the same thing about Will.

But the Palazzo is now our new favorite even with a few flaws. After reading reviews on here we decided to upgrade to the Prestige Level. It was definitely worth the $100 upgrade! The easy check in without a wait, the champagne welcome drink, the afternoon snacks, evening reception and breakfast was all worth it! The evening appetizers during the cocktail hour weren't that great. But the free drinks (not just wine or beer) were worth it. It was fun to try new cocktails. The room is gorgeous. I loved the bathroom amenities (which may have been upgraded with the Prestige level). But our bathroom was starting to come apart. Some decorative molding was missing but the nails were still showing and the vanity mirror was chipped in a few places. Another flaw was the bed was not as comfortable as I expected for a hotel of this caliber. I've definitely slept in better. The pool was my favorite place and this is VERY important to me when going to Vegas. I was treated as I would have been at the Four Seasons. Nice chair cushions and the attendants would come by with sliced oranges, cucumbers, otter pops, frozen towels, etc. Loved it! Not many kids, very quiet. And we enjoyed the lounge chairs in the water as well. However, the pool side restaurant Solara by Wolfgang Puck was not good. We ordered a turkey sandwich which was pre-made and so dry and so underwelming and a pizza (no drinks) for $34. Definitely a waste! The next day we ate lunch at the Grand Luxe inside the Palazzo and we had 2 entrees which were delicious for only $25. Much better! We also ate at Lavo which had excellent service but the food was only ok. I think they have a great marketing plan to get in you the door. But the food was overrated.

However on a second visit my opinion really changed. This time, I loved it and I would stay there again \u2013and strongly recommend it to others. ROOM: We had booked the \u201cLuxury Suite\u201d (the cheapest room) and over the phone I was told it would be $30 a night to get a view of the Strip. Instead of paying upfront, I asked nicely at check in, and we got a free upgrade to a \u201cLuxury Suite\u201d on a high floor with an incredible view. On the weekend there was lots of noise from the pool (blaring club music) but otherwise it was very quiet (except when some window washers passed by outside the window and banged on it loudly for quite a few minutes). The bed was extremely comfortable and the extra space (couch, desk, table, etc.) makes a big difference from a normal sized hotel room. You really have room to spread out and feel at home. The bathroom is also very big and this time, I found it less \u2018dark\u2019 \u2013 although, it is still quite dim \u2013 even when I brought a mirror to the window, I still didn\u2019t think there was much light. POOL: From the window of our room I could see if the pool was busy or not, and in the mornings on weekdays it was pretty empty. However, I found that it was incredibly hot outside by the pool (granted it was August) and there is absolutely no shade unless you get a cabana. There are no pool umbrellas, etc. At certain times of day there is some shade from the shadow of the building, but that passes and then you basically feel like you are being cooked by the sun. Unbearably hot. I guess their goal is to get you inside to the casino\u2026 but still, the lack of shade was just painful. The pool chairs are all pushed close together in long rows (imagine being in a theatre but its lounge chairs instead of regular seats) so there is no privacy \u2013 you are basically right on top of the people next to you, unless you get a cabana. Also, smoking seems to be permitted at the pool. For me this was a bad thing. RESTAURANTS: The food at SOLARO by Wolfgang Puck by the pool was shockingly good. However the seats and tables were quite dirty, which was a turnoff until the food arrived and we forgot all about the dirty tables and chairs. We also had dinner at Postrio Bar & Grill, Tao, Noodle Asia, and Zeffirino - all delicious - and a friend was thrilled to find that Canyon Ranch Caf\u00e9 and Grill accommodated his crazy diet restrictions. SPA: I had a pedicure and massage at Canyon Ranch Spa. The spa is very nice, but not over-the-top craziness nice. The lounge areas were great \u2013 the only place in the hotel outside your room where you can just sit and read a book in A/C for a few hours. The prices were not outrageous (all things considered) and I was able to use a discount coupon that was provided to us upon check-in. LOCATION: The location of the Palazzo is amazing for shopping. It\u2019s right across from the Fashion Show Mall. You don\u2019t need to go outside to get to all the great Palazzo shops and Grand Canal shops. Even in the heat it\u2019s not so bad to walk to the Forum Shops at Caesar\u2019s. Although I did love staying at the Encore, in comparison it is quite far away from the rest of the strip, and in the blazing heat, having to walk a few extra blocks is unbearable. On the sidewalk between the Palazzo and the Venetian (you cannot access it from inside the hotels) is a Walgreens drugstore (food, drinks, tons of cheap souvenirs, and the usual pharmacy/drug store stuff), to stock up on bottles of water, snacks, etc. The worst thing about this hotel is the endless loop of Phantom of the Opera songs playing at high volume in the elevators.

Glad we did as the room was fantastic. Took a taxi from the airport and was at the front doors in no time. Was greated by door staff who were very friendly and helpful. When you walk into reception it is very oppulant and there are several checkin desks. Checkin was a breeze and we only had about a 5 minute wait. As we upgrded to the Palazzo part of the resort, they was quite a long walk to the hotel lifts. You walk through the Venetian casino, then through a part of the shopping complex which leads into the Palazzo casino. The room was amazing!!! Split on 2 levels, the top level housing the beds, Built in wardrobe, dresser and the lower level housing the huge sofa, coffee table and writing desk. There were 2 huge, very comfy beds to choose from, each with their own full length stools at the foot of the bed. There is a very large dresser with plenty of storage space and a substantial built in wardrobe with plenty of hangers. Windows are full length and we had a great view overlooking the strip. Husband used to enjoy watching the pirate show while I was getting ready. The bathroom was a good size, with 2 sinks, 2 mirros, vanity table, shower cubicle and oversized bath. Toilet was in a seprate room within the bathroom. There were 3 televisions in the room, one opposite the bed, one in the sitting/lounge area and one in the bathroom. Maid service was spot on and the the room was extremely clean, all toiletries were replensihed daily. Everything you need is in the hotel, iron, ironing board, hairdryer etc etc. What I thought was a good idea is that unless everyone in your party has a room card you can not enter the lifts as security would not allow you past to the lift points. The whole of the resort, incuding casino was extremely clean. The mall within the hotel is FANTASTIC, especially as it had my favourite shoe store in there!!!!

This past two months I stay at NyNy Las Vegas, Caesars Palace and Aria, and in a couple of weeks I will be at the Wynn for a week. Let me start by saying that I was pleasantly surprise about the Palazzo, not being a big fan of theme hotels any more. The parking lot is underground which is not the nicest thing, but its compensated with the fact that you don\u00b4t need to walk much to be at the casino (which is a big plus in Vegas) When you enter this property, you feel very welcomed. The smell is great. Check in was extremely fast, less than 4 minutes (ask for a high floor at the counter and got a 39th room without paying upgrades or tipping) Elevators are at the center of the hotel (another nice touch) The casino itself is not very big, but you have the Venetian next door, plus a shopping mall and a bunch of high end restaurants. Rooms are extremely well appointed, not as big as the Venetian but very modern and elegant decor. We had 2 queens, a large living room, a desk and a big bathrooms, 3 plasma screen in total. (closet a little small for the room size) Bathroom: 2 sink, a separate tub and shower and a vanity table and chair. Pool area is nicely landscaped and you can go into the Venetian pool (another plus) one of the pools is topless Restaurants are very goog, but if you want to have a great meal, it will be expensive as everywhere else in Vegas. The only downside is that there is not a buffet on the premises, which is unthinkable in sincity, but you are steps away from the Wynn (probably the best buffet on the Strip) There is a huge mall across the street (Fashion Show) and you are in a nice location that is developing fast, also very convenient to the Convention Center. So overall, I would definitely stay here away without thinking about it. There is a group of hotels: Wynn, Aria, Cosmopolitan, Mandarin Oriental, Caesars, Bellagio and I would add Palazzo as the top hotels in Vegas, it is just a matter of personal taste since all of them are premiere accomodations. I would recommend any of them if you get a good deal on the rate.

We did get an offer in the mail for three free nights, free show and 150 in casino credit. We couldn't pass up such a great offer. The room was very luxurious. I didn't think I'd enjoy such a fancy room as much as I did since you really don't spend much time in your room in Vegas, but it was still a great bonus. Quiet and the blackout curtains were a great benefit as we did nap during the day. It's really convenient to be able to walk right into the Venetian as we gambled and ate at both Palazzo and Venetian while we were there. Something you get at a more expensive hotel is great service and better selections of drinks/beer at their bars. We were able to get beers from many of the Craft Breweries like Dogfish Head, Stones and others at their bars. Even on the casino floor for the \"free\" drinks you could get a big selection. Our first night we arrived late and we asked on the casino floor where to go to get players cards and instead of directing us, the person just went and got our cards and brought them back to us. The hotel grounds were very clean. The casino is open and spacious. The Phantom show which was free with our deal was great! The tickets weren't in the nose bleed section either. We were very close to the front. We ate at Delmonico which is in Venetian. This was our second time there and it was excellend once again. We hope to get more offers to Palazzo as now that we've stayed there, we don't want to stay anywhere else!

Our ten year old daughter and I came along a few days before the conference as a mini vacation and we stayed in the Prestige Suites. This offers a private check in and exclusive lounge and amenities which were very welcoming and lets you avoid the overwhelming casino scene. The extras provided made for a nice family experience. Our Prestige suite was a huge room with two queen beds and a living room area so we didn't feel crowded in. The lounge offered a continental breakfast, refreshments in the afternoon, and complimentary cocktails and hors d'oeuvres after 5pm. Breakfast was very generous and offered a large variety of items including hot egg and ham filled croissants. Afternoon refreshments included iced tea, lemonade and small treats...we kept popping up throughout the day to stay hydrated. In the late afternoon, the cocktails and appetizers were so nice, we opted out of dinner at the Bellagio one night. There are many pools at the Palazzo, one especially for the \"21+\" off to the side, which leaves the large main pool a comfortable environment for families. A large selection of complimentary DVDs were offered, which we took advantage of one night when we wanted to stay in. The concierge even made fresh popcorn for us. From the comfort of our room, we were able to watch the pirate show and fireworks at Treasure Island...terrific since it was incredibly hot during our stay. We also discovered that if you go up one floor from the casino, you can access the guest elevators through the shopping mall level without having to walk through the smoky casino...great when you have a young child along who is not used to smoke. There are three types of family shows on the property and a host of restaurants, including one run by the Cheesecake factory. Zefferinos was also a very family friendly restaurant. The food was delicious and good value. We didn't feel like we needed to leave the Palazzo property. At the end of our stay, my husband had to transfer to another hotel where the conference was held. He was sorry to go and more so when he discovered the other hotel was a huge step down in quality from the Palazzo. Las Vegas is not normally our first choice for a family holiday, but the Palazzo proved to be an oasis for my family. It is a very elegant facility without being snooty. The prestige lounge was an added feature that helped us shield our daughter from much of the undesirable elements of Vegas. The staff really help to make our stay welcoming and personal. It made our stay more of a family resort experience and well worth the extra penny. This mom was grateful for a stress-free family vacation with the best of Vegas thrown in.

We picked the Prestige package - as a family of four with small kids, this is a great option - beginning with the checkout - no waiting in the sometimes long lines, simply take the elevator up to the Concierge lounge and check in there! Both visits we arrived before 10 AM, were granted early check in and got great rooms overlooking the strip and the Pirates / Sirens show! Sadly, this most recent visit was a little lacking! When we arrived into the room, it was not as clean as we have come to expect - the ottoman was covered in fingerprints and there were numerous dusty surfaces. We found a childs shirt in one draw and some trash in another. The cupboard did not always close and one drawer was broken! But still the rooms are very spacious, bathrooms are beautiful and I would chose nothing else! This visit we did find general cleaning slow and below standard - this however ended when one day - having been out the room from 8AM and arriving back from the pool at 4 PM the room was just beginning to be worked on - a quick complaint ensured a very clean room and each morning we called down for an early clean! The cleaning staff seemed grumpy and overwhelmed; one got very upset when we simply asked for another towel (we had just two in the room) The Prestige package is a great option for an extra $100 a day: each morning there is a breakfast option - nothing fancy, but great with kids - various types of coffee drinks, water, fresh fruit juice, fresh fruit, cereal, pastries and cooked items. Lunchtime you can just grab candy (a feast for the kids) lemonade , waters and sodas....when you think how much you will spend on breakfast and waters alone this is worth it! The evening sees an open bar -with good top shelf drinks, champagne, wine , cocktails, There are basic hot and good snacks but some folks were clearly expecting a full dinner - which is not what was advertised. This time the place was packed and a staff member we recognized from the past told us that there were always three staff members in the evening and this had not changed to reflect that fact that word has got out and this package is more popular! As a result food ran out quickly (though we saw several greedy folks stuffing their purses with celery and carrots no less!) and drinks took a while to arrive - more staff are clearly needed! The property is beautiful, smells great and the food choices are amazing - Morels is a great choice for brunch (try the Bloody Mary's) ; First has excellent choices with a cool upbeat vibe....think Sublime playing as everyone sings along, with simple yet tasty food!!

Free canap\u00e9s and free drinks from 5pm - 8pm every day! The lounge has a great view of the strip and in particular the Treasure Island pirate show. Free breakfast from 6.30 - 10.00am - simple but enough to keep you going until dinner later that evening. It was not overly crowded but was popular; great for people watching! About $214.75c per night when signing up for 'Grazzie' - we did this on the phone and was worth bargaining then down to this price.

The Palazzo ranks up there with my favourites. Upon checkin we were upgraded to a Sienna Suite free of charge, it was a stunning room. Amazing, full living room, separate bedroom, workout room, bathroom of over 150sq ft, jacuzzi tub. Impossible to fault them on this! Beautiful. The casino was a lovely break from the crazy action elsewhere, even when busy it was not as smokey due to good ventilation and nice high ceilings. The usual assortment of slots, table games range from $15+. Pools were awesome as well, it was nice to see it connected to the Venetian. The Palazzo has 4 pools of its own, and the Venetians deck next door is also large and only about a 4 min walk from the Palazzo pool. While not the best pool on the strip its still very pretty, and I enjoyed my hours in the hot sun on one of the loungers plunked in the pool. Nothing in my mind sticks out as annoying or obtrusive in any way. One of the most convenient things we had was the parking garage location. It was literally a 30 second walk from the room elevators to our car, this is not the case at so many other properties. Also nice is the Grand Luxe Cafe at both Venetian and Palazzo, its by the Cheesecake Factory people, generous portions, and truly delicious.

We also comparison-shopped the Aria, Cosmopolitan, Bellagio, and Wynn. The Palazzo turned out to have the largest rooms and the easiest means of accommodating six guys in two rooms without breaking the bank. We got two adjoining Bella (2 queens) Suites and some amenities. Everyone had their own bed, though the fold-out sleeper sofa is not a queen-size and you'd be hard-pressed to sleep two in it. We didn't choose the Prestige level because it just didn't look like good value. We had no problems at check-in, or with extra keys. While Sushisamba and Morels were disappointing, the hotel VIP passes to Lavo worked smoothly and we had a great time there. The resident DJ was great. The chairs in the sports book are comfy, and the staff friendly, especially toward first-time bettors who are still learning. Strip-view rooms meant that we were looking at Treasure Island and the Mirage. I don't know if it would be worth it to pay extra for that view, or for a high floor. Yes, the walks are long from point A to point B. It's a large hotel, as are the rest of the properties on the Strip. The casino was mercifully small in comparison to the Wynn or others. We also visited friends in rooms at TI and PH, and the drop-off in room quality is precipitous. We're glad we paid a little extra. We're also glad we paid to stay at a happening location rather than the lifeless Vdara or Trump. Negatives: 1. Housekeeping never replaced our little toiletry bottles, and they ran low. That feels like nickel-and-dime-ing for a five-star hotel. 2. The pool is nice, but you had to get there early to get seats. Often rows of seats would be \"reserved\" with nothing more than towels, their owners nowhere in sight. That wasn't so great. The Palazzo poools were definitely nicer than the Venetian pool, which had a thin layer of grease on the surface on a weekend.

Living area had L-shaped sofa that could easily seat 4-6 people. There is a table with 3 chairs plus a desk complete with fax machine. Bedroom area was also very large. Note that some rooms are different: our travelling companions were on a different wing of the same floor, and paid the same price. Their bedroom was a good 5 or 6 feet narrower than ours. We had very large bedside tables, each with a large lamp with room to spare, plus a chair next to the bed. Our companions had tiny little tables, no lamps, and no chair. We were in the back wing, with a view of the mountains, golf course, and Wynn. We had a limited view of a section of the Strip. You can pay extra for a view room, but how much time are you going to spend looking out your window? Another big plus was the excellent sound insulation. We rarely heard a door slamming or voices in the hallway, but never heard a single peep from rooms above, below, or on either side of us. One of my favorite features was the location of the parking garage. We've stayed at several hotels in Vegas, and if you've ever been there, you know you have to walk a mile to get from your room to anywhere. Well, here at the Palazzo, you can park in the underground garage, and be mere steps from the elevator to your room. TIP: don't bother trying to park on the 1st level where everybody else goes. Drive down the ramp to the third level. There are two sets of elevators, one marked \"front desk\" and the other marked \"casino.\" Park as near as you can to the casino elevators. (We never had a problem getting a close space.) Take the elevator to the casino or shops level (either level works), turn around the corner, and just a few feet away are the elevators to your room. Yay! It is so nice to park close and have short walk/elevator ride to your room, after you've been walking miles and miles in the Vegas heat. So why do you need duct tape? In the center of the ceiling is a little red light that flashes at irregular intervals. We didn't notice this until the middle of the night on our first night... we went to bed at 2am, and at 3am I was wakened by this red light going off and on. At first I thought it might be some sort of fire alarm. I was using earplugs and when I saw that red light flashing, my first thought was that I might have not heard a warning siren. It bugged me all night. The next day, I asked our companions if they had such a light in their room. It turns out, a previous occupant had covered the light with duct tape, and they slept like babies. I called the desk and asked if something could be done. They said the light is a motion detector which helps reduce energy use in unoccupied rooms, and there was nothing that could be done about it. I went to CVS, bought some electrical tape to cover the light, and slept peacefully for the rest of our stay. We did not use the pool, but it looked nice. There seemed to be a series of small pools, rather than one large one, and lots and lots of comfortable lounge chairs. Pretty fountains and landscaping.It's nice that the elevator stops right near the entrance to the pool, so you don't have to go traipsing through the casino dripping wet in your swimsuit on the way to your room.

The suite (with the open bar and breakfast) was reasonable at about $245/night.

I was surprised at some of the negative reviews on here. We didn't even upgrade for a strip view of the Wynn golf course and with sunrise over the mountains an added bonus. We stayed on the 41st floor as recommended to get the highest floor possible and just asked and reception and they obliged. The only negative about the room is we were given a room with a a joining door that did carry the sound through from the room next door, not too much but a little, but maybe we should have asked. The Hotel itself is excellent, you can walk to the Paris within 10-15 mins and to Belagio within 15-20 mins. Taxi fair from and to anywhere in Vegas seems to be $10-15. Checkin and Checkout were excellent, all staff were great ad always address you y your name when they can find that information. The Casino is great it was quieter than the more touristy Venitien but had the same level of games available. Within 2-5 mins from your room you can be in the venetian cannal shopping center. Hotel was extreamly clean and modern, valet parking, bag store was quick and convenient, and plenty of choice of restaurants available. Read y reviews on Bouchon, and Morrells both very good. The only con was perhaps the pool, i cant say for sure but we think it was very chlorinated, and gave both my partner and I eye issues. However we didn't come to Vegas to sit by a pool and if we had we would have chosen a hotel for its pool such as the Mandalay Bay.

We had stayed a week prior at the Trump International. Coming from the Trump - we were very disapointed with most aspects of the Palazzo. When we arrived, we were greeted by a rude female valet attendant. My husband politely told her that he needed to return our car to the car rental company as soon as we had checked in and asked her if it was worth him using the valet. She rudely told him that she coudn't guarantee that our car would be here when we returned. When he asked her if it would be better for him to self park, she said that she didn't care what we did, without giving us any guidance. So that was the beginning of our stay at the Palazzo. When we checked in, the representative at the front desk told me that they did not have a non-smoking room available for us. I told him that it was important that we have non-smoking room as this was what we had reserved and I have a young child. After a long time and few sighs from the attendant (like I was putting him out in some way), he finally found a room for us. When we arrived in our room, it was okay. Quite dirty and run-down. Lipstick marks on the glasses and black hairs all of over the bathroom floor and in the bathtub. You could tell that nothing had been replaced or updated since their opening several years back. I don't think that I would have found this place to be too bad if I hadn't just stayed at the Trump -- a real 5 star hotel. When I arrived in the room, I noticed that there was no fridge. So I opened the mini-bar and removed some of the soda bottles so that I could keep my son's milk cold. When the bell-man arrived with our luggage, he told me that I needed to put the bottles back as they all have a 20 second delay on them. If they are removed from the fridge for longer than 20 seconds, each item is billed to your room. I called the front desk to find that $180 was charged to our room. I was able to explain what happened and they kindly removed the charges. However, it did cost me $75 to have a fridge brought to our room for the duration of our stay. At the Palazzo, the resort fee is supposed to pay for the high speed internet, newspapers and the gym. Well - the Internet is ridiculously slow. Terrible actually. As for the newspapers - you have to go and get your own newspaper from the store in the Shops on the second level. When we stay in a hotel, it's nice to read the paper while enjoying coffee in a bathrobe in your room - without having to go down the elevator to get it . Oh yeah - about the coffee. None of the rooms have coffeemakers. Five star resort, hey? Even a Motel 6 has coffee makers in the room. When housekeeping came in, the only thing they did was make the bed. None of the wine glasses that we used were washed or replaced and they never replaced the towels. We never had facecloths during our whole stay. I assumed that all of the rooms would have refigerators because they call their rooms, \"suites\". We really liked the pool areas and spent a lot of time there. Every pool, however, had a white scum along the surface and edges. It turned me off a bit but we used the pool anyway. My son and I both had rashes before the week was done. If I can say one positive about the Palazzo - it would be the gym. the Palazzo offers two great fitness facilities. We took advantage of them.

Last year, we had stayed at The Venetian and loved it. This time, we opted for the Palazzo (which is internally connected). The Palazzo is an all-suite hotel just like The Venetian, but we found that the suites here had newer and better furniture as compared to The Venetian. Some of the highlights of the room: - Curtains were remote-controlled. - There was a nice sectional couch in the small living room area. - Light below the TV gave a good look to the room. - Spacious suite - Furniture makes you feel like you are in a palatial suite (theme of the hotel) The bathroom was similar to the one at The Venetian. The rooms were very upscale. The lobby was pretty too, but not as good as when we had visited last year. We ate mostly at the Grand Lux Cafe on the Palazzo side of the casino. There's another one on the Venetian side. This restaurant has the same founder as the Cheesecake Factory (another restaurant that we love). The menu and decor bear resemblance. We loved the food there and it was also very reasonably priced. Another good thing is that it is open till 2 AM. On the day we arrived, we had checked in at 11 PM and were very hungry due to flight delays. We were very glad that this restaurant was open. Now about the not so good experience regarding the service. When we checked in, we had left our bags with the porter. After getting to our room, we left in about 20 minutes to have dinner. Bags had not arrived by then (no problem). When we got back, bags were not there since they need someone to answer the door to leave the bags inside (again that is fine). We called the front desk and asked them to send our bags. They told us they couldn't put our bags in our room because we weren't there and that they'll send them now. Half an hour passed. No sign of bags. We called again for our bags and after a long wait on the phone and being transferred multiple times, we were told again that our bags were not checked in because we were not in the room.... Me: Ok send them now. Another wait for another half an hour... no sign of bags. A third phone call (and we were very sleepy at that time) and we were told there was NO REQUEST MADE FOR HAVING THE BAGS SENT!! Huh!! I asked them to send them and make sure they enter it in their system. Finally, after 15 mins, the bags arrived. We were almost half asleep... Total wait time: almost an hour and a half! Service for the quality of the hotel left a lot to be desired. The front desk doesn't have much idea about anything. We had asked them on the day of our arrival about which restaurant will be open at that time and they gave us two names (both of which were closed).

There they will give you your choice of a glass of champagne and/or a cold bottle of water.

You could fill a plastic cup full of candy and take it with you on your walk of the strip or sit down in the big beautiful chairs and enjoy the view. From 7pm to 9pm they have yummy desserts out for you to have as much as you like ( ie big cookies, brownies, squares). Earlier in the evening they have hot (ie calamari, quesadilla, burritos) cold appetizers (ie fruit, veggies, nuts, crudities, dips) as well as freshly made hot soup, and fresh bread.

We had a sunk-in living room area with a wall to wall picture window so we could checkout the Vegas skyline.

The rooms are full of dilapidated furniture, stained carpet, food trays left in the hallway, and the slowest hotel service I've seen for quite some time. The tragedy for me is that I spent numerous hours before booking my trip reviewing travelor comments from the Message Boards. I kept mimimizing the negatives and trying to accentuate/pay attention to the positives only to sadly discover that what I read was true. This hotel may have been \"the place\" to stay several years ago, but that was several years ago and things have changed. Yes, the rooms are large suites, and yes they have sunken rooms, but when your furniture has stains on it, is broken/chipped, and the sofa is made up of crushed velvet material (mine happens to be red), that dates back to the era of Gunsmoke in the saloon, you know that you are in trouble. When I requested a change of rooms, it took two (2) hours for them to deliver the room key. Customer service (?!)-not. And DO NOT believe the tips from travelers on how to get the best room, I gave the front desk person a substantial amount (more than $20) using the so-called \"sandwich\" technique---and still was given rooms of very low quality and cleanliness. One of the members traveling with me reported the next day that his room looked as if someone had conducted a wild orgy party in the room. BELIEVE the comments about the heavy doors slamming. The doors appear to get stuck and then require an extra push to close. It's a little startling particularly if you head off down the hallway not realizing your door is wide open.

The Room: Huge and great view (42nd floor with the view of The Wynn Pools). The beds are comfortable and the bathroom is terrific! This is Vegas so the room has some wear and tear issues, but everything works and is clean. The TV in the bathroom is difficult to see from the tub, but the tub is large enough that one can shift and still be comfortable. The sunken living room and business center area was very enjoyable. The Food: Room Service was passable, but not great. We ordered it two times and the order was never correct. They really should offer a free dessert or something extra when they mess up...it would go a long way to make the customer's experience better. The food at Carnivinos was exceptional. The quality of the food and the service was terrific...highly recommend the aged steak and the desserts! Solaro at the pool had good food. You can go to the carry out window and take it to eat by the pool. This is pricey, but convenient...my husband loved the breakfast...he ate waffles three days in a row! The Pool: If you want a good chair get there before 10. The main pool is shaded by the hotel until about noon. This is nice because the heat is very tolerable in the shade. If you want sun sooner go to the Venetian pool. If you want to stay at the Palazzo and get sun the soonest go to the opposite side of the pool from the hotel and get a chair to the left of the lifeguard chair. The Spa & Gym: The Hot Rock Massage was the best I have ever had. My husband is still talking about how terrific it was. When you get a spa service you have complimentary access for the day to all that the club has to offer (free exercise classes, use of the sauna, steam room, and the various shower experiences)..this is a must is you stay here! You can also get water and fruit all day...great if you do an early morning service then want to be at the pool and run in to get a little snack. If you don't get a spa service you can buy a pass ($20) and get access. The Gym is complimentary..there are two. I worked out every day and tried both of them. Take the extra 2 minutes and walk to the Venetian gym. It is by far the better of the two gyms. Keep checking on the prices of your room after you book. If you call and ask The Palazzo will adjust the price down if they offer your room at a better price.

Because we frequent Vegas and like to gamble, we do not have to pay for rooms, but from what I've heard, Palazzo room rates are reasonable. On a negative note, the Palazzo has cut back on a few minor things probably to save money due to the bad economy. They changed their brand of soaps and toiletries from a high end brand to a plain one. Turn down service is no longer standard, and they no longer give you little business cards in the parking structure reminding you where you parked.

Everything about our stay was lovely. My husband had been to The Venetian three weeks prior with the guys and was worried that I would find the pools a bit to noisy. He had to attend a convention and knew that I would require a relaxing pool side retreat rather than the young party crowd. I love the Bellagio and once I find something I like will usually stick with it but my husband wanted me to try something new. He contacted Anthony (I believe he looks after feedback at the hotel) and asked him about the pool situation. By the time Anthony replied we had already took a chance and booked Palazzo, the newer tower attached to the Venetian. Anthony upgraded us to a room that was on a higher floor with a great view of the strip. Very nice of him. Our room also had a great view of the pool and the best part was when you got off elevator you didn't have to walk a mile to get to our room. Muchly appreciated. Pool at this hotel was amazing. There was also a party pool with DJ if that is something you are interested in. There are I believe 7 pools and they have done a good job of separating the party crowd from the relaxing main pool. Had I been with friends I would have checked out Azure (the pool party area). Oh and the hotel did a great job of setting up the access to the pool. The elevator takes you straight there and you only need to walk down a short hall rather than a long walk from room to pool. Location of this hotel was also wonderful. Close to convention centre & the Fashion Show Mall. It is also attached to The Venetian so you have all of their amenities and access to The Venetian Pools if you wish to walk over and check them out. I recommend checking out Lavo. This is a fabulous restaurant right by the front lobby.The only complaint I had was with the concierge. We asked them a couple of questions on separate occasions and they were not very helpful and didn't even have suggestions. At the Bellagio I found the concierge went out on a limb to make sure you were taken care of. Wasn't the case at The Palazzo. I wanted directions on how to get to the outlets and maybe the concierge looked down on this. She acted like she didn't have the time of day to give out such info. Really ticked me off. When I pay this much money to stay in a hotel I expect to get good service. This was however my only complaint. The shops are on the second floor. I didn't figure this out first day and was missing the luxurious five star feel. Main floor connection to The Venetian felt to me more like a shopping mall but if you access via 2nd floor shops you get the luxury atmosphere. Oh and if you desire the party atmosphere of the newly legal 21 year olds..,this hotel is not for you. This hotel is a classy hotel. I didn't see many young intoxicated folks here. None actually which made me happy. I enjoyed checking out the other hotels that had the party scene but loved that I could come back to The Palazzo and relax. If you do want to check out a great club, take a cab down to The Marquee at Cosmopolitan. It is recommended that you phone ahead and get on the access list. The Wynn next door has a lovely little pizzeria that served lovely breakfasts beside their waterfall. Just a short walk and a nice quiet place to eat in the shade. Would I recommend The Palazzo..,YES! You will love it :) We will be back VERY SOON!

Full stop. I stayed there in 2009 (for a bachelorette party) and loved it. Full stop. My boyfriend surprised me with a long weekend there in April (well done, boyfriend :), and I loved it in April as much as I had loved it in 2009. Full stop. Every room in the Palazzo is actually a suite, and every suite positively gleams. The views are fantastic, and the hotel itself has great restaurants (e.g., SUSHISAMBA and I Love Burgers). Dangerously indulgent \"shopping opportunities.\" Writing this review makes me want to go to Vegas---and stay at the Palazzo--again. Still, for the sake of full disclosure--the hotel seems to be getting too busy to handle itself. For example, my boyfriend received a fax from \"The Office\" during our stay, and no one downstairs would deliver it to us. Originally, they said that they would not deliver it for \"security reasons,\" which made some sense, but, when I went downstairs to get it, the woman at the desk admitted that they are just too short-staffed to make such deliveries. (Which would explain why she had no problem giving a fax addressed to my boyfriend to me.) For that matter, even though we arrived an hour after check-in time, our room was not ready yet, and no one could give us a sense of when it would be ready that day. (Luckily, we only had to wait for two hours, and they would have given us a room in the Venetian, had we been in a rush.) So, the moral of this story: I love the Palazzo.

This was our first experience with Las Vegas and most likely our last. It was definitely something to experience if you have never been, but not a place I can see spending a long vacation at. One thing that you need to get used to is that it is a very busy and fast paced town and you will do a great deal of walking. The sites in the city where great to see and we had a lot of fun walking the strip. As for the Palazzo Hotel, it was not the service I expected from what is rated as a 5-star Las Vegas casino resort hotel. From the check-in we experienced a very disinterested and unhelpful associate. When I had questioned the room we were given as not being the king bed selection I thought I selected, she did not want to help or provide any type of solution to this. When asked if there was a way she could note my account to alert me if a room with a king bed became available she stated that I could check back with the front desk if I wanted, but she was not going to do anything regarding my request. She was very dry and not personable at all. Once we received our room we went straight to the elevators and just wanted to take a quick nap as we had been traveling over 8-hours to get to Vegas with getting to our airport and a 6-hour flight from the East Coast. When we arrived to our room we were shocked to find it completely in disarray. Please note there is no exaggeration in what I am about to say here as to the condition of the room. We walked in and found the beds to be striped of linens and all of them and the pillows were scattered across the room and floor. There were towels all over to room and what we think was food or dirt in clumps around the floor of the room. There is a marble partition between the bed area and sitting area where we found strange stains, empty glasses of liquor and a pair of rubber gloves (not sure what the gloves were for, nor do I think I want to know). As we walked further into the room we found more glasses on the floor, in the bathroom, on the window sill and on the table we found the remnants of drugs, presumably cocaine, in lines and power form on the table. I immediately called the front desk as my wife began to find more drugs (small pills all over the couch and floor). Upon reaching the front desk I explained our situation and my complete shock that they would send a guest to a room like this. I fully explained the condition of the room, including the fact that there were drugs in the room . The front desk person simply asked if I wanted housekeeping to come up and clean the room. Really? After explaining what condition the room is you think any normal person wants to wait for housekeeping? NO!!! I explained I wanted another room ASAP and we were leaving this room and would head directly to a room they provided on the phone. We went to the new room and had to wait 20-minutes for the security guard to come and let us in. At this point we are beyond exhausted and just wanted to get into a clean room. Even after explaining the issue to the front desk and the security guard the only acknowledgement we received was a plate of (4) chocolate covered strawberries in our room the next night. Seriously? Not even a complementary room charge for one day or a dinner certificate to one of the restaurants, or tickets to a show? Strawberries? I know this is Vegas and I am sure they see things like this all the time, however we do not and I guess I expect more from those in customer service fields and a 5 star resort. I can understand an unmade room, but this room was a disaster and what if we came in with children and one got a hold of the drug residue or pills on the floor? Other than this experience on the first day the rest of the stay was fine. The hotel is very nice and HUGE! Almost too big. The casino areas were nicely laid out and the restaurants we ate in were very good. We did find the employees in the clothing shops to be a bit obnoxious and pushy, which turned us off from spending any money in these stores. We just made note of what we liked and bought it on-line when we went home. The convention halls where very nice and there was a great deal of space. The rooms where clean and the staff that assisted the event were terrific. There was one older woman who was waitressing during one of the luncheons, I wish I could remember her name, who was fabulous. She was great to talk to and was very upbeat and friendly. The pool was surprisingly small for a resort so large. We tried a few times to go in the pool, but each time it was shoulder to shoulder people and there was no chance of getting a chair in the pool area unless you arrived at 5am. Additionally the bathrooms in the pool area were too small for the number of guests in the area. The men\u2019s room could only hold two gentlemen with one urinal and one toilet. This became an issue in the evening at the Toa Beach Club as this was the only bathroom on the patio beach club floor. Imagine a few hundred people all drinking, eating and only a few toilets to share. It became ridiculous. A little tip if you take the airport shuttle (very convenient by the way). The Shuttle will drop you off right at the front door to the hotel for $6.00 a person and runs every hour. This is the best deal as a cab is around $30.00. Keep in mind that the buss picks up in the same area you get dropped off, first level outside to the right of the doors. DON\u2019T ASK THE BELL HOPS! They send us down to the lower level, which was for busses and limousines and a bus driver advised that we needed to go back up to level one. Funny how the employees of the hotel can\u2019t even get the location of the shuttles correct for their guests. We were lucky to meet the shuttle right when we came back outside, otherwise we would have had to take a $30.00 cab back to the airport to meet our flight.

The cheap rate we found for Palazzo was too hard to pass up and considering it was for Friday and Saturday night, we eventually booked it. Check in was quick and we were given a free upgrade to a high floor (43rd to be exact) luxury strip view room. The check in agent also gave us additional complimentary line and admission passes to Lavo. A free t-shirt was given to each us for joining their free loyalty program. The room was spectacular featuring a large bathroom, a \u201cbedroom\u201d, and a sunken living room. It is large enough to fit at least 5-6 people comfortably. We requested an extra set of pillows and bed sheets at 1 am and it was bought to our room within 5 min and the sheets were already heated. I have read some issues regarding housekeeping, but we had a different experienced. We left our room for about an hour around 11 am and the room was already made by the time we returned. By the number of carts in the hallway, it seemed like there were a housekeeper to 3-4 rooms There are lots of pools at the resort. I thought it was a nice to have attendants help look for chairs. If there were no chairs at the Palazzo pools, guest also had access to pools at Venetian and Venezia. We left Lavo around 2:30 am and we enjoyed having Grand Lux Caf\u00e9 open till 3 am. The Venetian/Palazzo does a good job trying to keep their customers within their resort. They have basically everything from casual dining to fine dining to shopping to clubs/bars. The resort offers two large shopping areas and two large casinos. There are also a large number of quality shows in the two hotels.

We went to the room and found a large room, with a murphy bed and 2 sofa sleepers. No bedding, no pillows. I then called the desk and asked if this was our upgrade-- having to make our own beds and sleeping on a roll out mattress. They assured me that it was and told me that this room was much nicer than the one we reserved. So, we called for bedding, made our beds, and tried to sleep. The next morning I went to the front desk, who then told me that we had been given the wrong room. They moved us to our original room. The room was clean- and actually had beds!

We purchased our own beverages (we thought 5 dollars for a 12 oz soda, 7 dollars for a beer, and 39 dollars for a bottle of champagne was too much) and placed them in the frig. Housekeeping replaced the hotel's beverages in the refrigerator and we were charged for the price of every beverage that was placed back in the frigerator along with a restocking fee. This amounted to 168 dollars - all charged to our room and we hadn't opened a single beverage of theirs! We did complain and they removed the charge.

I was offered a list of what I could upgrade too, along with the fees. I guess nothing is free in Vegas, but oh well. The room itself was clean, and had a great view (behind the strip, facing the Wynn). I had a few issues with the room, the most appalling of which was moths. Yes, the room had a moth problem. Moths don't come out during the day, but when we came back at night, there were at least 20-30 moths hanging around the window and inside the lamp. Creeped me out big time. When I told the front desk about it the next day, he offered to move me, but I asked them to first see if they could take of it - and then call me either way. I never got any such call, and dealt with this issue for a few more days. (they did offer to take off the resort fee upon check-out, but I would have gladly paid the fee for a moth-free room). The casino is nice, but doesn't appear to be huge. This is because everything is in one bug rectangular room. Some others, like MGM, snake it around the hotel so it seems a lot bigger.

Last time we stayed at ARIA Sky Suites and were very impressed, however, this time we thought we'd try a different hotel. The Palazzo Hotel has an all Suite section called Prestige and looked pretty good on-line so off we went. Unlike the ARIA Sky Suites (our last time in Vegas), there is no complimentary airport transport included, however the hotel does have a $6 shuttle that is fine. The suite comes with all the usual amenities - stocked mini bar, 3 x flat screen TV's, electric curtains, sound system, Wi-Fi etc etc. We had a \"Luxury Suite\" on the 24th floor (I think it goes up to 36) which was a nice size and had a sunken lounge area and an OK strip view (we could see the Mirage Volcano show from the room). Our booking came with access to the Club Lounge for complimentary breakfast which was fine (2 x hot items + continental buffet) and way better than what the ARIA provided in their Club Lounge. The Palazzo Club Lounge is a \"proper\" lounge with a lot of space and nice strip views from the 23rd floor. The Club Lounge also priovides drinks + snacks almost all day and then drinks + hors d\u2019oeuvres (different every night) from 5pm till 7pm. The entrance to the Club Lounge also doubles as the Prestige check-in desk and Prestige Concierge. A note here about Prestige check-in - you still have to enter the hotel via the \"normal\" entry, then go through the casino, then up to the 23rd floor to the exclusive Prestige check-in. Maybe it's me, but I don't like the experience of having to drag all your bags etc through a packed casino to get the check-in (do they really think you're going to drop all your stuff and do some gambling on the way in or out?). During our 3 nite stay we had a couple of small issues and some questions - all were handled quickly + efficiently by the hotel staff. As an \"exclusive\" area of the Palazzo hotel they do have security who checks you have a key in order to get to the elevators to the Prestige floors. However, it didn't seem to stop people coming + going with heaps of drinks and several guys without shirts (maybe all they are concerned about is that you have a key) - this isn't really a complaint, it's Vegas, so it's always party time, just don't expect everyone to be dressed in suits and gowns in this \"exclusive\" area. The Palazzo is attached to The Venetian and between them there are heaps of shops and easy access to the Strip. It's also just become and ICH Hotel affilliate, so if you're in Priority Club or an Intercontinental Ambassador then you get all the benifits. As usual for Vegas, in-house there's stacks of restaurants /celebrity chefs, pools, pool partys, bars, shops, in-house shows, niteclubs and more ways to part with your money than you can imagine. There also is the only decent (Euro style) coffee that I've found in Vegas in a small cafe just near the elevators - it's \"proper\" coffee with a barista, not the dishwater you usually find in the USA (sorry any Americans reading this).

Not amazing, but a view suite was the same as a non view suite, and as first timers, a view was a view. Prestige: great value. When you book the Prestige package, they waive the resort fee. Which means, it's really only an extra $80 a night. For which, you get breakfast (continental breakfast, two fancy options, GREAT coffee); drinks and snacks during the day; cocktails, hors d'oeuvres and desserts from 5-8.

I was told they don\u2019t have anything like that available but could give me sparking cidar. Well when we arrived everything was in place and it looked great. Then we went to pour a sparking cidar and it was sparking apple juice (yuck!). We called and they replaced it with 3 Smirnoff Ice which they suddenly could get and obviously didn\u2019t look that I had ordered 4 cidar not 3 but that is fine. Then the cork was so old on the red wine it crumbled as we tried to get it open. I have to say Jeswyn from the concierge who came and brought us the Smirnoff was great and tried to help us out she had a hard time as well. Finally sat down to toast our birthdays and noticed a nasty red wines stain on the cushions on the couch and what looked like a cigarette burn hole on the other side of the couch. Check-in \u2013 was ok, we upgraded to the Prestige which was worth the extra little bit. Champagne to greet you. Was told the Prestige is separate from the palazzo they could not provide me with any complimentary passes to anything. I had mentioned that we had some with package and they printed them off but were not going to offer this up if I didn\u2019t ask. I thought that as I had mentioned we had 2 birthdays and had room done up for the birthdays would have gotten something for them but nothing. Mirage had upgraded us to a 2 bedroom penthouse suite the last time we stayed there because we didn\u2019t get adjoining rooms so I guess I was expecting similar. Room \u2013 couch stained, bathroom was okay not as big as other hotels we have stayed in. The beds were terrible we all had sore backs/shoulders after sleeping in these. Room size is decent, nice size sitting area. Also, no iPod dock just a CD player which meant no music except laptop or radio for tunes for the room. Prestige upgrade \u2013 this was well worth it. Breakfast, coffee/tea bottled water all day, cocktail hour all included. We even had a day that we were all tired and went back up to the room and stopped in at the concierge and picked up a couple of DVDs to watch and they provided us with popcorn to take back to the room to watch with the DVDs. Pool \u2013 we rented a cabana and when we got there again no iPod dock so there was not music. We asked if they had one and it was $35 to rent for the day. We had got it and had listened to about 4 songs when the music from Azure the adults only pool started and we couldn\u2019t hear our music because Azure\u2019s was so loud. It was good music coming from Azure but we obviously didn\u2019t need the iPod dock. Mentioned it to the cabana server we had and he said yeah I guess I should have thought of that. Cabana was nice, food and beverages were expensive compared to The Hotel/Mandalay and the Mirage. Kicked out at 5pm from the cabanas were told you could sit in front of them but not in them, again not used to having it all day. Went back up to our room took the iPod dock as we had it for the day and then got a phone call asking where it was we said we had it up in our room and they said they were sending someone up to get it. When we mentioned about only listening to 4 songs he said he would email his manager to see if they would remove it from the bill. When we check out they hadn\u2019t removed it but the gentleman that checked us out removed it for us. We didn\u2019t rent a cabana any other day as we were only going to be half days at the pool and not worth it. They do offer cabanas for \u00bd price for \u00bd a day though. Just sat around the other pools for the rest of the times we went to the pool ended up with just ordering a bucket of beer as 2 Bloody Marys were $24 I guess, as I wanted this to be an outstanding weekend for my 2 Birthday guests I was just disappointed, as I am not used to having to fight with a hotel to get everything corrected or done properly. I would recommend Mandalay Bay, The Hotel, Luxor and the Mirage over this hotel based on check-in, room, service, staff etc. over this hotel.

We had to stop by the front desk nearly twice a day to get new keys as our lock repeatedly stopped working. I also had to wait 2.5 hours and get on the phone 5 times to get an extra comforter. Then I was told by the staff, who were nice, that the comforter costs $400 dollars so that is why they do not normally provide them. Give me a break, this is a multi-million dollar establishment, and you are being stingy on the bedding? Oddly enough another staff member brought a second comforter, after the mgmt told me they would have to search for one. Give me a break. They will also not make your bed if there is a spec of clothing on the bed. My friend had laid out a bathing suit on the bed and therefore they were unable to make the bed, again give me a break. 2 star hotels have more efficient service than this. The restaurant Morel's was overpriced for the experience, when ordering a $53 filet med-rare, the filet came out blue, as in very rare. The server said that they often under cook the med-rare, so she usually orders them med-rare 'plus', um for $53 when I order med-rare that's how it should come, period,also thanks for the server mentioning that in advance...fondue also overpriced and sub-par. Oh and forget about the drink service at the hotel pool and in the casino. The servers at the casino would let you know to order two drinks at a time saying it would take 5-10 minutes two return, then return with the drinks about 25 minutes later. At the main pool near tao beach, the server tells my friend to give her the $20 bucks in advance of the drink so that she could bring the change right away, okay that's fine. However the server doesn't return for 25 minutes, this is NOT an exaggeration. We did notice the server would only return with drinks when her tray was full, ridiculous, don't take a drink order then wait until you get enough orders to go to the bar and get the drinks. Oh and the most tacky point of the night, the awful dancer in Lavo on Friday night, she was just embarrassing to watch. Was there any good? Yes the hotel is beautiful and the rooms are stunning. The variety of restaurants is awesome as are the shops. Postrio was great, as was our server there, and we went to Dos Caminos twice.

When we went into our room the room seemed ok, but when we started to unpack we noticed that in two of the drawers on the right had side of the dresser, someone had left their dirty underwear, we immediately informed the front desk and housekeeping. They did not pick up the dirty underwears from two drawers till 7:00pm the next day. Our toiled was not flushing either, they sent someone to fix it, he left in a minute saying it was fixed and guess what - it was not fixed. We had to call front desk again.

We wanted to do something on our 'tick list'. Las Vegas was something we thought we ought to do, rather than had a desperate desire for. We were wrong - we LOVED Vegas. It was everything we thought it would not be, classy, clean - spotlessly clean, suitable for all, we loved the weather it was warm and sunny but not dry and dusty. We loved the shows, the lights and the people. Yes, there are areas which are not so great but you get that everywhere. On the choice of hotel, because it was for a special occasion we opted to go up a level and chose the Palazzo which is the sister hotel to the Venetian mostly because it promised all rooms as suites with luxury and space. We were bowled over, the room was all and more than we expected. We chose to have a room at the back so we overlooked the Wynn pool area and golf course - absolutely fine for us. The bathroom was massive, luxurious and carried everything you could ever need. The bed was so good it was the first time ever we returned home and found our own bed lacking!!! The lounge area was beautifully equipped with sofas, tables, dining area and a desk with fax machine. The whole hotel is extremely well maintained. The casino area was large and ok but our main purpose on this trip was not to gamble but to explore, although we did dip our toes in for an hour or so most days at the end of the day after dinner. We did a couple of extras and would really recommend the sunset helicopter trip - amazing!!! We left Vegas late afternoon and flew over the hoover Dam and landed in the canyon itself. Here we were given our picnic and champagne and spent 20 minutes chatting to the pilot and 4 other travellers. We then flew back as the sun was setting - this has to been seen to be believed - fantastic. We also ate in the revolving restaurant on my husbands birthday - very good food, shame about some of the staff who were rude. Also we ate later in order the secure the window table we had requested months earlier(!) - and found ourselves the last in a section of the restaurant although still well within the opening hours by at least an hour. A kindly member of staff switched the aircon to freezing so we were unable to enjoy our coffees and the view and ended up moving away back to the bar - shame on you whoever you were you were the only disappointment in Vegas hospitality. Other highlights are just walking about, enjoy the shopping, the lovely restaurant for lunch in Neiman Marcus, the free shows and most of all the wonderful fountains at the Bellagio and don't miss a visit to Town Square, a short taxi ride away where all the locals go on their days off.

We have stayed at the Venetian before, but this was our first stay at the Palazzo. We checked in about 4 pm, there were many front desk reps and the process was smooth and easy. We were given a room on the 48th floor with an incredible view. The room was exceptionally clean and well maintained, everything worked perfectly. The only issue we had (hardly worth mentioning) was a drawer pull that fell off one of the drawers. We set it on top of the desk and it was fixed the next morning (we did not ask) after housekeeping serviced our room. Housekeeping services were excellent. On our second day we asked for some additional towels (only had 2 bath towels) and when we returned to our room not only did we get the additional towels but more bath products than the two of us could possible use. The nightly turndown service/room refresh was great and the little box of chocolates on the night stand was a nice touch. Everyone we dealt with at the hotel was pleasant and professional. We were having such a nice time that on Friday morning, after we were already packed and almost ready to leave for the airport, we decided to see if we could extend our say for an additional night. I called the front desk (friendly, pleasant , professional) and was told that they would love to have us for an additional night and said he would call back in a few minutes as he might be able to offer a discounted rate. Within 10 minutes he called and offered a $40 discount on the previously quoted rate for the weekend night. Overall, we were completely satisfied with the Palazzo. The Palazzo is a beautiful property and the location is perfect. Easy walk to so many of the Strip hotels.

No issues here - we had the standard suite - with view. One thing to note - the views from the Palazzo are great, but the Palazzo is a little further down on the strip and set a bit further back on Las Vegas Blvd, so you kinda get views of the sides/backs of the casino's (assuming you're view is looking out in the direction of the venetian). In my opinion, the Bellagio, Planet Hollywood, Flamingo, etc. are dead center strip nowadays. So the majority of the lights and scenery from our room was a bit further down the strip, but it was still a very nice view - if you get floors 40 or higher (we were 43), you should be ok - otherwise your view may be blocked by the venetian. Also I'd request the 900 wing. The windows are big, but they're not floor-to-ceiling windows which are much nicer. The room was nice although one of our TV's didn't work - but we didn't complain - there was also a light-bulb that didn't work, but that was ok too - we weren't picky. The shower is nice but semi-small, and the tub is also nice but not really big enough for 2 people - and we're not big people...it's not a Garden oval tub - it's just a normal rectangle.

While the Palazzo prices may seem higher compared to other hotels on the strip, be sure to look at the price per square foot. I stayed at the MGM the last time I was in Vegas and maybe saved $15 per night, but the MGM didn't have double sinks and didn't have nearly as much room. The Palazzo beds are comfortable, love the blackout shades and feel that customer service is great all around.

The cost to them in lost revenue from reservations, NOT MADE, will exceedd their \"ill gotten\" gains. It is their hotel and they are entitled to charge whatever they want (read, whatever the traffic will bear) but they should disclose clearly beforehand what is involved. I have been to Las Vegas numerous times (no, I am not an inveterate gambler - I truly love the shows -more about this later), and have stayed at: The Bellagio, The Wynn, MGM Grand, Encore and now the Palazzo. All five star hotels, but I would rate the Palazzo at the bottom of this list and it is NOT because of their rooms which are truly very nice, nor their service which is typical, nor the wait to check out which I understand is also typical, but because of their ridiculous charges - some not quite fairly revealed in advance. The hotel did tell me that there would be an additional charge for a third person in the room - this though they describe it as a suite (note: there is no separate room and no privacy in this area). Has anyone ever heard of them reducing the \"room rate\" when it is occupied by only one person? What a ripoff and an excuse to \"gouge\" additional money from the customer (it will never happen to me again), but at least they openly disclosed this. The one that really hurts is the \"Resort Fee\" which not only is not openly in front of you but I still am not sure what they charged for. The newspaper which I never received? The pool which I did not go into? A towel? Just raise the standard room rate and let the customer make their own decision.What do they think I am staying at their hotel for - it is because it is a resort with typical resort features. We checked out the \"M\" hotel. Yes, it is about ten miles out of town, but it is right alongside I 15, (as the hotels on the strip are not far off) and the trip is less then ten minutes away, while driving from one strip hotel to another can easily exceed this (and usually does) because of intense traffic - all the time. Given that you can park your car for free at the strip hotels (they want you to come into the casino and they are layed out that you cannot get to your car {or your room} without walking through the casino) there is very little downside from staying a bit away from the hub bub, noise, etc. of the strip. On the positive side there is the substantially reduced charges at off strip hotels such as \"M\", and it is truly beautiful - you are not giving up anything. I believe that some of the venues in Citi Center (Cosmopollitan, Vidara, etc) are much better values and plush and beautiful as well. Gambling is gambling and not very different regardless of the venue, though I think you do get a better deal downtown Vegas than in the hotels - they want your business more and do not take you for granted, like the \"big boys\" do. The other gambling \"Meccas\" all have the same games, the same slots (bigger payoffs - \"loser slots\" in downtown Vegas - and better rewards promotions), but no gambling area has the shows that Vegas has. Not just the live entertainers, but the Cirque shows, water shows etc. You can usually shop them in advance and get a \"deal\". I resent Broadway, and oftentimes regret spending in excess of $100.00 for a less than mediocre production. I have seen \"Love\" (in Vegas) a few times and it is still wonderful (it seems to change somewhat from year to year) and worth every penny. Likewise the water shows \"O\" and Le Reve do not leave you wondering why you went, and while some prefer one to the other (I think I like \"O\" slightly more, but both were tremendous) you cannot go wrong with any of the Cirque or similar productions.

Check in was quick, mentioned it was our Ruby anniversary and was there an upgrade, at a cost of over 100.00 dollars a night we were told, No upgrade there then, then Donald told us they were full and there wasn't any upgrades, then I mentioned the concierge upgrade at over 100.00 dollars a night, all of a sudden he magically pulled out an upgraded room for us, I thought you were full, I said, 'did I say that' he said, so he was dishonest then. Then he said we had to pay 20 dollars a night for Resort charges, I explained that we were on a Virgin package holiday and we'd already paid the fee upfront, this he didn't believe and after much arguing we eventually checked in our room. It must have been the worst room in the hotel. A view of a wall, with noise coming from extractor fans outside. We complained every day about it until eventually we spoke to a real nice person named Brian on reception who took pity on us and told us that was not a nice place to be, he moved us to the front of the hotel with great views. We informed the Birgin Rep that the hotel were going to charge us Resort fees. They informed the hotel these fees were already previously paid, I asked Donald at Reception if he thought it was legal to make charges to patrons for services they would not be using, he just shrugged his shoulders...Resort Fees: Free use of the gym: Do I look like I spend all day in a gym? I asked Donald (I'm a senior) Free Wi fi. I don't have a lap top with me Free entry to the Spa. For what? You don't get anything free after that Free newspaper. No thanks Free local calls. To who? Virgin informed me they had waivered the fees and I could use the facilities, when I checked this with the hotel they said I had to pay for Wi fi..... Which I thought was included in the fee. CONFUSED.com Pools: no shade, I asked about umbrellas but they said people would fight over them, so I mentioned that if the hotel is supposed to depict Italy then they should be more authentic, what a rubbish answer! The large pool at the Piazzo is warmer than the large pool at the Venetion. Although the Venetion has the sun there early. They close most of the other pools even though the place was crowded. The ambience of the hotel is good and I like the Casino except for a rather rude older lady on the Roulette, when we watched the roulette for a couple of minutes before we played she commented 'are you going to play or are you just going to stand around and look pretty' not the kind of retorts one would expect as a guest in a five star hotel, it put us right off, needless to say we walked away. Vegas on the other hand is very clean and friendly. Hotel is near good shopping Mall, good buffet at the Mirage and if you have transport an even better buffet at the Hotel M. When we arrived home my husband checked his bank statement and it has shown - yes you guessed it, Resort Fees.... Even though when we checked out we paid our phone charges and the resort fees showed nil. They still charged us for phone AND the resort fees. How dishonest is that!

At the Wynn and Bellagio I always found if my room price went down after booking, it was honored. The Palazzo did too, but was not happy about it. I tried the Prestige level. They charged me $100 though I was alone. The breakfast and dinner choices were very good, as was the open bar. What amazed me was some of the people who were using the Lounge- very loud, boisterous, etc. I know this is LV, but I thought the lounge would be more refined. The Palazzo did not have the same vibe as the Wynn at all. I think it is because the rooms are so much bigger, and at least 4 (and probably more) stay in a single room. The hotel was packed. I also did not care for the pool. You could not get a seat in the afternoon, and the pool staff, other than at the bar or people helping with towels, were awful. I had turndown 2 of the 3 nights. The room amenities were not as nice as the Wynn's. Service was overall pretty good- esp the concierges- but I was treated shabbily at a bar inside the casino. Spa was ok.

We picked a five star hotel on Priceline, entered our price and we ended up with a successful bid. How much did we save? After taxes and the mandatory resort fee ...about 40% based on what the hotel had listed on their website for the day we wanted to stay so you can imagine our excitement to get such a nice place. We drove up to Las Vegas on Saturday morning from Orange County and arrived at 11:30am and decided to check in even though my husband was slightly worried that we would have to check in until 3pm. Our room was ready, check In was efficient and off we were to our room on the 15th floor. Now the elevators are certainly fast in this hotel, but just an FYI the halls do not have the best lighting so my husband almost ended in a room that has the ice machine. Our room? not too bad for what we paid and we had a nice view of the Wynn Golf course, would I have preferred a view of Treasure Island to see the Siren show? OF COURSE but I'm not going to take away from the room which offered plenty of space and I can't believe what I'm going to say....which is, that I wished the girls were with us to spend the night in the room. I'm sure they would've loved the three TV's in the room with one of them being in the bathroom. I liked the fact that the toilet was closed off from the rest of the bathroom. The beds were comfortable and boy did I love those pillows. The room had a nice sitting area which anyone could have easily used to sleep in since the sofa was comfortable and roomy. What's the best part of the room? The drapes that keep the pesky sun out in the morning because how many times have you been in a room in Las Vegas and that sun just shines straight into your face? Now I read some of the reviews posted by other travelers and I'm not going to write a review that is going to take the hotel apart for minor things like a slight cigarette burn on the sofa cushion which was odd considering we were in a non-smoking room because the overall experience was pleasant and my room wasn't dirty. Why nip on minor details? I'm not going to live here, i just want a comfortable bed and clean room! I mean , how often do you hear pleasant and Vegas in the same sentence?

A Prestige Suite allows access to a floor of the hotel on which you enjoy complimentary breakfasts, afternoon tea, and evening hors d'oevuvrs, desserts, and an open bar serving premium liquor. The cost is an extra $100 for two people. The Prestige floor is quite wonderful. If you choose to do so, you could spend your entire vacation eating and drinking on the floor without spending money elsewhere (the bar only serves \"free\" drinks from 5 to 8 pm, but non-alcoholic beverages and \"pay as you go\" alcoholic drinks are served all day, and both the breakfast and evening offerings easily satisfy as full meals). The floor is very tastefully appointed, offers a wonderful view, and service is beyond excellent. We were there during the royal wedding, which was fitting, because on the floor we felt like royalty. The rooms, unfortunately, are not quite 5 star. Our complaints were, I will state right off, relatively minor, but when you are paying approximately $300 a night for a room, you expect better than: 1) a piece of molding, probably about 100 by 50 cms, that had come off the wall, left by housekeeping on the double sink counter; 2) a picture with shattered glass immediately by the entrance; 3) a sofa on which the seat and back cushions clashed terribly (had we been at a more contemporary hotel, I might have forgiven the look as an attempt at a stylish modern effect, but in the conservatively furnished room we could only believe that the hotel is recycling bits of furniture; and 4) mattresses and pillows which were, if not uncomforable, considerably less comfortable than our bedding at home (which made arriving back home from holiday less unpleasant). We both enjoyed the Prestige floor very much and would, therefore, stay again if room rates were no more than we paid.

Palazzo has become my favourite after staying at The Venetian previously. I stayed 3 nights at the Palazzo with friends and then had one night on my own so I switched to another hotel down the strip that was more affordable for one person. The second hotel did not even compare. The rooms at the Palazzo are large and very nice. They are a little bit newer than the Venetian since the tower is newer, which is one of the reasons I prefer the Palazzo to the Venetian now. The rooms were very clean and the cleaning staff did a great job each day I was there. I would have liked a radio with an iPod hook up in the room though. The hotel is very nice and open. The high ceilings and wide walkways in the casino make it easy to walk around and also help with the smoke. I didn't notice the cigarette and cigar smoke nearly as much as I do in other casinos that are more tightly compacted. The restaurants were very good and Tao Nightclub is always a good time in the connected Venetian. The location is perfect for what my friends and I were there for. We like to gamble and walk around during the day and hit the clubs at night. We find the best clubs are at the Venetian, Wynn, Encore, and Caesar's, which are all within walking distance. If we had stayed further down the strip in the area of Planet Hollywood and south, we would have taken a cab out at night. The one negative I can say about the hotel is that Grazie seemed to have cut out all comps. The first couple trips I had to Venetian/Palazzo were comped rooms, but I guess I'm no longer eligible for them anymore. That's a bit of a let down. I've also heard people complain about the Resort Fees but these are now the norm in Vegas. Every hotel has resort fees and the other hotels I've stayed at are actually higher ($20 as opposed to $17 at Palazzo).

Granted, after showing the hotel manager pictures of just how bad it was he moved us to a different room (it was better, but not to the standard of a 5 star hotel), and gave us a $100 dining credit. To the room details: there were stains everywhere: the walls, the sofa (large pink/red stains), the desk (white gooey looking stain I refuse to think too much about), the tables, the tub, the shower, the glasses, the light fixture; the were several long black hairs sitting on one of the beds (the housekeeping supervisor tried to tell us that they had to of come from us, but we quickly pointed out that neither of us has long black hair); the in room copy/fax/printer has huge burn marks on it; the baseboards and walls were scuffed and dirty like no others I had ever seen. Instead of listing these in any further detail, I'm going to post some photos and let you decide if you want to pay to go stay at this supposedly 5 star hotel. One more thing, we ordered room service one day and after waiting an hour we called to check the status and were told, \"Jose is on his way up to your room right now.\" Then, 15 minutes later they called the room to tell us they were out of bagels and wanted to know if we wanted something else. At this point in our stay my buddy lost it, and I can't say I blame him. Why did they lie to us about something so stupid? How could it take 1.25 hours to figure out they were out of bagels? Granted, when we spoke to a room service supervisor they offered to comp the meal, but we were too hungry to wait any longer so we ate elsewhere.

We researched a lot of hotels on the strip and decided on the Palazzo. We wanted to be close to a lot of shows, be at a 5 star resort, have a nice sized suite, etc. Took the shuttle from the airport, as suggested on the Palazzo website. Arrived at the hotel last Saturday and checked in at 11am. We thought it might be an issue that we arrived hours before check in, but it was no problem. We stayed for 4 nights. Hotel room was great- big, nice bathroom, nice view from the 43rd floor, etc. Doors closing at the other rooms and people talking could be heard, but we were at the end of the hall, so it wasn't too bad. Mini-bar was missing items, so we called to let the front desk know, so it wasn't a problem. Our room was nice and clean all week, but there were always loads of room service trays and dishes in the hall. That was the only complaint I have about cleanliness at the hotel. The pools are fantastic! We loved the indoor shopping areas. Beautiful! We purchased most of our show tickets from Tix4Tonite, which is located across the street from the Palazzo, as well as elsewhere along the strip. We saw Phantom (amazing, super cheap, and located at the Venetian), Cirque Mystere, Love (bought those tickets from the actual box office, since it is a super popular show), the Beatles Tribute band, and Absynthe at Caesar's (crazy show geared towards the 20's and 30 year olds). Bellagio fountain lights at night were nice. Volcano and pirate shows at TI and the Mirage were cheesy... but free, so what do you expect ? :) We ate some meals at the hotel, but the best (and only)buffet we went to was at the Wynn (right next door). My fave meal was at PF Changs (great vegetarian food). A bit disappointed with Del Torro at the Palazzo. Best gelato on the strip was at the little gelato place in the square at the Venetian. Make sure you hit up the happy hours they have for drinks ($5 or less for beers or wine). We made the mistake of having a few of drinks on a patio on the strip and paid a FORTUNE! Re shopping: we went to the Primm Fashion Outlet mall. Not worth it! The Burberry store has closed and the mall looked like it had been hit hard by the recession. Next time we'll try the Prime outlets close to the strip. It was a great vacation for a couple trying to get away from the kids for a few days. Lots to do, plenty to see, great time!

Get a rental car as you'll need it if you value your feet, Vegas is big. Use the valet parking if you need to park up in any of the hotels, very handy... The nightclubs are expensive and most are geared towards good looking and well off individuals (I didn't meet this criteria but had complimentary tickets)!!!

The room was huge with a wall of windows overlooking the wynn pools and golf course and you can sit and watch those huge planes flying in out. The gentleman that checked us in was excellent.

I loved that right before you go to the hotels elevators, theres a coffee place and snack store in place, just perfect! Overall, Spring Break and The Palazzo was a great choice!

I wanted to get something nicer than a standard room and opted for the Prestige Siena Suite. This is basically the nicest room you can get outside of the super high end rooms that you need to call in to inquire about. I booked the room online, got my confirmation, and didn't think about it again until it was time for the trip. I left for the airport after work so I didn't get there until later in the evening. It was probably about 7pm when I got there. The front desk was pretty empty, there were maybe 2-3 other people there. I walked up to an open counter and checked in. The person helping me must've been ready to leave work for the day or something as he didn't really seem to care too much and just wanted to quickly get me checked in and be done with it. I walked into the room and instantly knew that they had given me the wrong room. It looked just like any other standard room in Vegas. I went back down to the front counter and told them that they checked me in to the wrong room. The person that was helping me before was gone and I got someone new. She asked me for my name and looked up my reservation. After a few minutes, she told me that it looked like there was no error and that this was indeed my room - a standard room. I had printed out my reservation confirmation so I pulled it out and showed her. My credit card had already been charged and I definitely did not book a standard room. It was very clear on my confirmation what room I had booked. She spent a few more minutes on the computer and then told me that she needed to check with the people that worked on the online reservations. She left me at the front counter and goes into a back room. I ended up waiting at the front counter for a good 10-15 minutes before she came back. All she said when she got back was basically \"Oops, looks like we made a mistake, you were right\". No apologies or anything. At this point, I was a bit upset as I had already spent an hour just trying to check in. Seeing that I had spent a good chunk of money and had booked one of their more expensive rooms, along with the fact that they had messed up my reservation and wasted a bunch of my time, I figured they would do something to make it up to me. Nothing. She punched me in for the correct room, and gave me a new set of keys. I asked her which room she gave me and what the view was like. She had given me a room that was facing the back of the hotel and basically just had a view of the top of a parking garage. I asked if she had any rooms with a better view available. She said yes, but wouldn't give me the upgrade unless I paid an extra fee (which was quite a bit more). I wasn't asking for an upgraded room or anything knowing that I had already paid for basically the best room I could get, I just didn't want to be looking at the top of a parking garage. She wouldn't budge. I was already running late and didn't feel like wasting anymore time so I just took the room. Again, no apologies or anything for their mistake and wasting my time. I walk into the room expecting it to be really nice. Instead, it looked pretty much just like a bigger version of the standard room I was in earlier. The only real difference was that they split the living room and the bedroom into two seperate rooms and gave the living room it's own seperate restroom. The first thing I noticed was that a few of the light bulbs were out. Then, when I tried to use the \"automatic\" window curtains, I found out that the remotes for the curtains didn't work and there wasn't any way to open the curtains manually. BOTH of the curtain remotes were dead, for both the curtains in the bedroom and the curtains in the living room. The doors to the restroom in the living room was squeeking badly and the lights inside this small side restroom was so low that it was hard to see. I wondered to myself how long it had been since someone had actually come into this room with all these problems. Definitely not something you expect from a 5 star hotel's \"top of the line\" room. Everything else looked ok, but again, nothing special, just the standard room with a bit more floor space. I definitely felt ripped off after seeing what I had paid for. Since I got the \"Prestige\" version of the room. I had access to the lounge on the floor. It was a fairly nice lounge and you get free campagne, coffee, snacks, and cocktails during certain parts of the day. I only went in there once or twice as I was out the rest of the time so I didn't really use it much. I also tried using the special priority service line that the \"Prestige\" room came with to ask for a few extra glass cups for a few friends that had come over and brought ther own drinks. The room came with two glass cups and they would only give us two more cups saying that we'd need to pay a fee if we wanted more. I thought that this was just ridiculous. It then took them over half an hour to bring the two cups up to us. My friends were staying in a cheaper standard room at another hotel and had no problems getting more cups when I went to visit them. All in all, the experience at this hotel wasn't very memorable. The room itself was very plain with lots of issues and the service was horrible. I wouldn't recommend this hotel for how much it costs and what you end up getting. I can get a room of similar or better quality at a different hotel for less money.", "Date": "April 5, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Cleveland, Ohio", "Title": "\u201cExcellent Resort but expensive Trip Report too\u201d", "Author": "LondonLady", "ReviewID": "UR102898601", "Content": "We stayed at the Palazzo from Wednesday March 30 through Saturday April 2. We arrived just before noon on Wednesday. Check in was easy although rooms were not ready. They did have rooms available immediately but we wanted adjoining rooms so we had to wait. The first room was ready around 3pm, so we were able to get our luggage into that room, but the second room wasn't ready until around 7pm. They call your cell phone when your room is ready to let you know. The rooms were very clean, decorated beautifully and quite roomy. The beds were very comfortable, flat screen TVs, etc. Also the front desk was very accommodating. I called down to find out where the business center was to print out my boarding passes, (I didn't bring my laptop, but there are connections and printers in every room) and they did it for me so I wouldn't have to pay for internet access. We had a problem with the lights, and housekeeping responded very quickly. Baggage was handled quickly and efficiently. We were able to store it on Saturday as we were flying back on a late night flight on Saturday. When the baggage clerk saw the taxi line, he walked us out the back door so he could flag a taxi out of the line for us since we were going to the airport. They do have late check out, but they charge for it. That is probably why the second room was late in getting checked in. Check out is 11am, if you want 2pm it is an additional $50 plus tax, and 6pm is an additional $100 plus tax. We decided against that. Be warned: the hotel has a resort fee of $17.00 plus tax per room per night, and that is settled up when you check out. The bar in the room is well stocked, but very expensive - water is $5.00 per bottle, pop is the same and it is motion sensitive - if you touch anything it records it. We checked the bar when we got in the first room and several items were missing. We called the front desk immediately to let them know so that they had a record that we did not use any of the items. No coffee maker in the room, there is a coffee shop right at the bottom of the elevators, very expensive, one coffee, one hot chocolate, one bagel and one crescent - $17.00. The pool was crowded, you have to be there no later than 10am to get a seat. Towels were plentiful, and you can use the Palazzo pool or walk over to the Venetian pool. We did have breakfast at the Grand Lux Cafe - they have a buffet breakfast, it was very good. Also had dinner at Zine's, the Asian restaurant, also very good, we had coupons for Zines for $30.00 off, but it just about covers the tip!!! Not cheap. Also ate at First Bar, with a coupon, that was also excellent. Carnellettos in St. Marks Square was also a choice for dinner, very good too. I did find the service very slow in the stores and restaurants, for some reason. We did a bit of shopping, and it just seemed like there wasn't alot of help. Not sure why. Took long to get checks, etc. Took the tour to the Grand Canyon, be warned, you are on the bus probably a total of 11 hours. The bus left Treasure Island around 6:30am, you go to the bus depot, breakfast is water and a power bar, some coffee, you load up onto the bus around 7:15 am and set off. Lunch is a buffet around 11:00 and you dont' get to the grand canyon until about 12:30pm and you depart around 3:30pm with some bathroom stops. I enjoyed the Grand Canyon, but you are on the bus a LONG TIME!!!!!!! We used Grand Canyon Tours. Also, be aware the trip is expensive, $189.00 per person plus a fuel surcharge, and then you also are requested to tip the drive $15.00 per person. Our driver was excellent, gave great advice, and had fun movies to watch so I was happy to give him the tip.

There were a few bad reviews on here and we were a little concerned before we went, however there was nothing to be concerned about. The hotel is huge and you could spend all day in there without seeing sunlight as it connects to the Venetian so the complex itself is massive. The Rooms - These were amazing. A large suite with a comfy big bed, living area and gorgeous bathroom. This is probably the best room I have stayed in and I have stayed in a lot of hotels. There was a dressing table in the bathroom which was great for getting ready in. Location - The best. Central on the strip and near to many of the main hotels and nightly shows. You wouldn't find a better spot. Casino - This was good and always busy, although most of the tables are higher buy ins which fits in with the standard of hotels. One issue was they wouldn't accept our English driving licences as ID and we had to go get a wristband fro security (this was the only place this happened and we are in our lates 20's) A passport would have been fine. Food - The restaurants that we went to were fabulous. There are so many to choose from and we didnt' have a bad meal our whole trip. A couple of times we asked the conceierge to book us a table which they did and they were really helpful. On Friday and Saturday lots of places were full so if you want to go somewhere specific book early. My favourites were Morels Steakhouse and CUT. I don't think there will be a bad place in the Palazzo or Venetian. Shopping - The shops in the Palazzo are high end/designer, nice to look in but I didn't buy anything. There is a big mall accross the road, you can cross safely to get there on the walkways. Here there are more high street names which were cheaper than in the UK eg Diesel, Levi etc. Pool - The pool areas are large and you can use pools from both hotels. Due to the height of the buildings sunny areas in a morning were shady by the afternoon, which was no problem as we just moved around. It was often too hot to be there for too long. At about 4 o'clock there was a good place in the sun by the Venetian. Other things - We went to see Love which was one of the best shows I have ever seen - would highly recommend. We also went to Bills Gambling Hall for cheap beer, the Bellagio for the fountain show. You can explore all the hotels so that is great. We stayed there for 7 nights which we thought might be too long - However it wasn't long enough as we loved it so much. I can't recommend this hotel enough, one of the best places I have been ever.

We didn't mind the change and were told we could call to switch to a king the next day. When we got to our room I went through the papers the front desk had given us to find our breakfast coupons as the rate we reserved included continental breakfast. They weren't there, so I called to the front desk and they asked me to come down. I was surprised they would not bring the coupons to the room, which is what I would expect at a 5*. After waiting in line at the desk I got the coupons, but upon counting them later I realized that we were short two. We decided not to go back because we figured we would eat elsewhere one morning. The room was very nice. Great furnishings, large living room area, multiple televisions, huge bathroom with separate shower & soaker tub. All of the pillows were feathered and since I have allergies, I requested hyperallergenic ones. Somewhere the message got mixed up because housekeeping showed up and wanted to change all of the linens. The next day we decided not to go through the hassle of changing rooms since we are used to a queen anyway. Big mistake. We came back to our room the next night to hear the TV in the room next door blaring so loudly that we could hear what show was on. I guess we got some new neighbours during the day. We called security and they came up and found no one in the room - people left the TV blaring while they were out. Security turned off the TV and left. Next night, same thing. However, this time security didn't show up, so we didn't sleep well. We've stayed in Vegas several times at different hotels and though it's known as a party town, we've never had problems with noise at night. One other annoying thing is that there was some sort of security light because there are two stairs between the sleeping area and the living room area. I guess it's so people won't fall down the stairs at night. However, we couldn't turn it off and it seemed pretty bright when all of the other lights were out. As for other amenities, we wandered down to the pool area which was absolutely gorgeous, though we didn't get to use it because it was a little too chilly during our stay. The parking garage was big and we never had problems getting a spot. The free continental breakfasts at the Luxe Cafe were mediocre and the wait staff seemed confused about what was included. We upgraded to the buffet one morning and it was decent, but nothing special. We had a very yummy meal at Dos Caminos just off the casino. We like this location on the strip as it feels very central, it's attached to shopping and near the Fashion Show Mall. We like to try different places on the strip, so we probably won't be back to this one next time. Overall, it was nice rooms and just OK service, but it was the rude neighbours who ruined our stay.

Was woken up on the 2nd night at 4:00am to singing, chanting, screaming etc. What was weird is that I looked into the hall and the sound did not appear to be coming from my floor - no noise. But the party sounded like it was in my bedroom. For an expensive hotel the construction must be really cheap for the sound to come through loud and clear from another part of the hotel. At 4:30am called front desk who supposedly sent security. Noise eventually stopped. Found out later security did nothing, another guest must have stepped in. Called the front desk the next day asked a manager for some sort of compensation, a fruit basket, something. Nothing. They couldn't care less. Again in a less \"classy\" hotel I would have expected less. The other major thing was that the food was bad. Having been to Vegas a dozen times and shelling out big bucks for nice dinners, I don't remember ever having bad food. But it happened at the Palazzo restaurants again and again.

Although a newer hotel, the velvet is starting to show its age a tad, with the occasional odd stain here and there. Also, despite the mandatory \"resort fee\", there are few freebies common even in cheap motels nowadays: No coffee maker in room, no free newspaper, no free business center, no free breakfast for all, no really close-in parking, etc. As in all hotels with a casino, they try to keep you lost and make you walk through the casino to get anywhere, hoping you are dumb enough to stop at a slot machine and give away some of your money. Shop around for good rates on their website. Since they had dropped the internet rate a bit after I booked, I politely informed the desk of this when I checked in and asked for a free upgrade, after he had so very generously offered an upgrade for $45 and early checkin for $75! I got the upgrade to a view and the early check in for no extra charge. (Hint: Beware all sale pitches in Vegas and never pay extra for anything,) All in all if you take things in stride, you could do a lot worse than the Palazzo for the price, but if I could get the same price or say $50 more, I'd go to the Fours Seasons for real class, spotlessness and service.

My wife had a conference at the Venetian and I \"tagged along.\" There were some really great parts of the hotel and some not so great, so let me delve into the details. Great things... 1. My wife checked in and there were no issues. Her flight got in early ~10AM and they were able to accommodate her request with an early check in. Great start. 2. There are three sets of elevators (split up by floor) that attempt to get to your room quickly. There was only one time we waited for an elevator for more than 5 minutes. 3. Floor hallways were decorated nicely and mostly quiet. Once in the suite, the room is tastefully decorated, with 3 flat screen TVs (really necessary?), a king size bed and comfortable couch (we napped on it a few times!). We had no issues getting to sleep. 4. Casino floor - the gaming areas are larger and more open than most. They must have had an advanced air filtration system because it seemed a lot less smoky than the venetian. We had lots of fun playing blackjack there. Plus, if you play there a decent amount, they are willing to comp you some of your meals and hotel stay at the end. Not a bad deal. They were able to comp our last night as well as our dinner at Delmonico. 5. Fine dining - We splurged and ate at Emeril's Delmonico for dinner one evening. What a wonderful meal. We really enjoyed it. Get the strip steak and creamed corn. Absolutely worth it. 6. Lots of nightlife and \"scenery.\" Their nightclub is one of the busiest at Vegas with the longest lines to get in. Gentlemen, I'll leave that up to your imagination. 7. Location - all the best of the palazzo, plus the shops and the venetian just steps away...the resort is tastefully done with all the options you could ask for. Plus it is next door to the Wynn/Encore (which we enjoyed) and a short walk to the Mirage, TI, Caesars, Paris and Bellagio. This is one of the good things about this property, it's central location. Not so great... 1. Regular restaurant - We at at the grand luxe cafe for breakfast one morning, nothing special. Overpriced breakfast, but what would you expect in a high end vegas casino/resort? 2. Bathroom - maybe because we had a handicapped bathroom...but the shower was a bit hard to get in and out of, the shower pressure was on a bit on the low side and there was no door between the toilet and the rest of the bathroom. 3. Annoying motion sensor light in the room - I couldn't figure out what this was until I realized that the blinking red light was a motion sensor light. Very annoying. 4. No desk area + internet fee - I had to login a few times and it was very odd that the suite had no desk area. Plus it was $13 for the internet fee for 24 hours.

After walking our bags out through the lobby, checking them so they could bring them over to the Venetian we started our dissappointing walk over. Not the way I envisioned our stay. We arrived at our room (identicle to those at the Palazzo) and were hit with the stink of cigarettes. I wanted to cry. I called the Venetian front desk and an apethetic voice made it sound like she could not do anything but finally she said there was a two bed room. Thank goodness it smelled good... It was fairly clean but the bathroom door was dirty- especially that of the water closet (uh, a bit gross). Also there were nasty stains on the bedskirt. We gambled a lot for us and my husband played a lot of craps and although he handed his Grazie card in, there were no credits and/or comps for him, however, we both really liked the pit boss Jeff who was friendly (this was at the Palazzo).

Tourists are not quite as expendable a quantity that they once were. Service attitudes in general seem a little better. The Palazzo is excellent overall. It is elegant, quiet, and the room rate we paid was reasonable. There was a long line at check in but they quickly opened more desks. I was sure we were looking at a 30+ minute check in but it ended being about 10 minutes. The room was very good but showing some wear. The mattress was excellent; the extra room space very nice, the view was good. The sofa sectional pieces were very worn looking but because of the delicate material choice they may have looked the same years ago. We did not feel comfortable sitting on it because it seemed like it needed something in between our skin and it. I imagined that an ultraviolet light would display considerable nastiness. Including a working fax printer was a very nice touch for printing out airline boarding passes. The WiFi worked OK (included in the rip off \u201crequired resort fee charge\u201d).

The Drawers of the beverage center could not be closed, Design material on the cabinet under the bedroom television was broken off and sort of hanging there. Outside area of wall mirror was broken a as if someone had thrown something against the wall and hit it, then the mirror itself was repaired, but not the border. I did not notice this but my brother who visited did. Coffee table was a bit battered. Lets face it, it's a popular hotel and three years old. These are fixes that come about with a renovation and that's one or two years away. So, the rooms could be better. For some reason, the circuit breaker for the desk are blew and maintenance had to come to flip the switch which is located in a secret panel and I'm not tell'in where it is. A nice plus is the fact that they have a printer in the room so you can print you boarding pass and otherwise do work in your room. I liked this feature a lot. The view I had was just terrific and I was able to watch the pirate show had just come back from a break. Loved the fireworks. Good security with a guard that asked to see everyone's card key all the time, not just in the evening. Check-in was great with a really nice front desk staffer who really seemed to care. But the woman who was working the bell desk on the 28th at 9:10 AM really needs to learn some manners. Very offensive. Wrote about the issue in the exit survey and was told that a refund of laundry costs would be coming my way. That they would care enough to do this won me over and I'm staying there again April 1 and 2. I'm hoping it was an anomaly. Except for that one incident, I had a great time at this hotel and casino.

All of the stays prior to this one I was amazed and treated with the upmost respect, as well as the guest that traveled with me. For the stay as listed above I stayed in Suite 12-839, another guest of mine and his wife stayed in connecting Suite 12-837, and I had another guest that stayed on the Prestige floor. Upon arrival to our Suite 12-839 the makeup mirror was broken, T.V. changer was broken, and the remote control curtains were broken as well. For my guest 12-837 makeup mirrors broke, dirty glasses in the room. My guest made the call to get the items fixed in which makeup mirror and glasses were fixed and replaced. Our room 12-839 nothing was fixed. Yes I know it was New Years Eve when we checked in but it seemed that Palazzo was understaffed for what is one of the biggest days in Las Vegas. My guest called room service and could get no one to answer. Finally he resorted to calling the front desk to speak with a manger. All we wanted at this point was grapefruit juice, which was not available in the gift shop. The manager attempted to call room service on a manager\u2019s line and he stated he could not get thru, nor was grapefruit juice ever brought to our rooms. Lunch at the Grand Lux Caf\u00e9 on the Palazzo side on 12/31/10 started off well I had a group of 9, as far as taking our order, after that it went downhill. Refills on drinks 20 minutes; our server we are still looking for her. Once it came time for the check which I picked up for 6 of the guest, we waited at least 30 minutes maybe 45 once the waitress knew we wanted our check. I spoke with the manager about this issue, who stated its New Years Eve, and clearly didn\u2019t care. Dinner at Dos Caminos on 01/02/11 I took 10 people to dine, our waiter from the start acted as if he were on his own time and was not enthusiastic about waiting on us. We started off by ordering 2 double orders of Guacamole, followed up by 10 adult beverages. Once placing our order for dinner I ask for a round of shots for everyone, while in mid-sentence the waiter just up and walked away. Once dinner arrived it was less than desirable. All 10 guests were ready to depart and ask for the check. At this point I am embarrassed that I have had my guest dine here because of the service and the food. To get our check took easily 40 minutes. My guests were ready to get up and walk out, in which they didn\u2019t because they are business people. Once again the manager never comes over to ask how our meal was or anything. So I go and find him lollygagging around in the bar area. I advised him of our terrible service, and the time we have been waiting for the check. He acted as if he were going to go see what the issue is and return. The manager never returned I am embarrassed once again. As it looks to me there is a reoccurring theme that no one cares about customer service at the Palazzo anymore. I also must have misinterpreted the Grazie Club points system. New Years Eve $157 for lunch at Grand Lux $1202.00 for dinner at Carnevino which was amazing $4000 table at TAO for Kim Kardashian party which was amazing as well. But don\u2019t understand how that doesn\u2019t apply towards your Grazie points on New Year\u2019s Eve, but does any other night. 01/01/11 In Suite dinning $70 the lady that delivered the food was rude and slammed the door on the way out because she didn\u2019t get a extra tip. ATTITUDE is why. Sushi Samba $726 amazing I stopped by to talk to a casino host on 1/2/11 because we were checking out early the next morning to see if I would have any comps. I was unsure at this point. She didn\u2019t even check she said to return the next morning. When I did return I was told no one was there to help me so they would have to call the Venetian. The lady on the phone laughed at me and said nowhere close. That\u2019s fine but no need to laugh, and then she wanted me to give the ladies name that told me to come back so she could write her up. The saga continues bad customer service, and attitudes, embarrassed In ending any manager that I spoke with at restaurant didn\u2019t seem to care or follow up so it is clear that the customer is never right at the Palazzo. As far as the pit boss I am at a loss for words on him. Overall the ATTITUDE of the staff I encountered as well as my guest was poor. Clearly understaffed, on New Year\u2019s Eve.

I chose the hotel as I received a good offer via email from them. Checking in took 5 minutes with no queue, and the very pleasant and helpful receptionist gave me a room on the 37th Floor which he said was an upgrade as there was a view of the strip. He waived the resort fee as my offer email had not mentioned it, but I still had free wifi during my stay. He also said the room would be quiet as it was away from the lifts. Because of the angle of the room I could pretty much only see the Fashion Show Mall and Treasure Island Hotel but that was fine. However it was far from quiet - for the first three nights the room next to me was occupied by what sounded like a party of about 8 people who all returned to the room each night at about 3 a.m. to continue their partying. I finally called security who did deal with it fairly promptly. But why does the hotel allow 8 people to check into the same room? Apart from a dozy security guard who did not seem to check key cards, there did not appear to be much security, no visible cameras in the corridors or patrols. The 6th night I was there a man tried to get into my room at about 4 a.m., when I told him quite clearly he had got the wrong room he tried to kick the door down. I called security who then let him wander off to somewhere else in the hotel rather than escorting him away. Frankly I was very scared he would return and at no stage did anyone from the hotel apologise or contact me, or offer any kind of recompense for the 4 dreadful nights sleep I had had. Twice my room was not serviced at all during the day until I returned at about 5 and complained. It then took 90 minutes before someone appeared to do the room, giving the excuse of shift changes. The room was quite clean when I checked in however they were slow to refresh the bathroom amenities. The room itself was lovely and looked exactly like the website, however there were several light bulbs that needed to be replaced or the lights were simply not working when I arrived, and it took time to get it sorted. Also there was only one remote for the 3 televisions which did not work in the bathroom TV. Other than that I was very happy with the size and layout of the room. The smell of smoke in the Casino was not as obtrusive as at the Bellagio where I stayed last year. There are a great choice of shows, shops and restaurants in the Palazzo / Venetian complex including a Walgreens where you can buy bottled water and snacks at a 10th of the price charged for mini bar water. Restaurants I would recommend include the Grand Luxe which I think is open all night, Table 10 and Carne Vino. Stay away from Postrio in the Ventian which claims to be a gourmet restaurant but where my beef ravioli arrived at the table within three minutes of ordering.

We arrived at the Palazzo around 11pm. There was about a 30 min. wait in line to check-in. (typical) The rooms were nice enough for a weekend. We just flew in to see some shows so it was sufficient. The beds weren't as comfortable as one might think fo the price of the room. But, again....it was okay for a few days. The Lavo restaurant has delicious Italian food. Although, the extremely loud music and the waiter who was trying to turn the table as fast as he could was a drawback. For a few hundred dollar meal for two, I do not expect to be rushed. We received our bread, appetizers and salads all at the same time. And when we requested that he hold off on the entrees for a while, he replied they had already \"fired them\". At that point, we told him not to bring them until we asked for them. (we had a lot to eat already) The Grand Luxe restaurant was of good quality for breakfast on the morning that we left. I also want to add that the room service food was good, but an hour wait each time. Big hotel.....it was to be expected. Another problem area that I see for the Palazzo is the \"Taxi\" line area. The taxi line is downstairs, underground. This is the only place you can get a taxi. Although, taxi's are dropping people off at the front entrance and leaving empty. 2 hours before one of our shows, we waited in the taxi line for 20 min. seeing only 1 taxi arrive, and take no one from the taxi line, but instead taking people with luggage (we assume to the airport) The line was long and not moved in line for 20 min. we decided it would be quicker to walk across to street to the Mirage, get in their taxi line which moves very fast mind you (dropping off and picking up at the same time.....makes sense) we waited approx: 10 min. hopped in taxi and made it to our show at the Rio with an hour to spare.

Stayed at the Bellagio, Las Vegas last year with our family and loved it. Thought we would stay at the Venetian this year as this also a 5 start hotel. There were no rooms available upon our early (11 AM) arrival at the Venetian, so we were offered two identical \"Venetian type rooms\" in the Palazzo Hotel, which is part of the Venetian. The rooms were big and spacious. We found them very comfortable. Great view of the mountains, lots of room for 4 adults (we occupied 2 rooms with 4 occupants in each room), and we were given rooms on the same floor to make things more convenient for all of us. The view from the 39th floor was beautiful and the rooms were very quiet. If there were people in the rooms adjacent to us, we didn't know it. We received complimentary continental breakfast tickets at the Grand Lux Cafe. You could upgrade to their Breakfast Buffet for an additional $8.50 per person, which we did. It was well worth it as our family loved the breakfast buffet. They had a great variety of food and it was all very tasty! We paid a resort fee of $17 plus tax per room per night ($19.04); not quite sure what the fee covered, but it included internet and printer usage. I had no problem with the fee as I was informed of it \"up front\" when we made our reservations. What ensued caused me to give their service a rating of 2. The printer in my room was out of ink and had no USB plug to connect to my laptop for printing. I was told they would replace the ink cartridge in my room but I would have to pay $10 for the USB plug if I wanted to print anything. I informed them that there was no USB plug when I entered the room, so why was I required to pay for something that should have been attached to the printer upon my arrival? They informed me they were sorry, but Palazzo occupants had been taking their USB plugs and they would have to charge the next occupant for it if they wanted to use the printer. It would cost me $10 and I could keep the USB plug when I left. I found it incredulous that they would make me pay for something that they should be providing as a service that I already paid for. I did not buy their USB cable. Instead, I went to our son's room, where they had a USB cable connected to their printer, and printed our boarding tickets for our flight back home from their room. Other than the incident with the USB cable, we had a great time at the Palazzo. Their shops were great, the canal was beautiful, the staff was very polite and helpful, and the location of the hotel enabled us to leave our rented van in the garage so we could walk to most of our destinations on the strip. We would stay there again. However, next time, I will bring a USB cable with me to connect to the printer in my room in the event the same thing happens again. One other note: There is a 24 hour Walgreen's located right at the corner of the Palazzo. People packed the place buying drinks, snacks, and other \"essentials\" that would have cost many times that if you purchased it at the Palazzo. For instance, a package of 'M&M' candy at the Palazzo would cost $9; it would cost you $6 for a small bottle of Fuji water from your room. You could buy those items for many times less than that at Walgreens.", "Date": "December 24, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "2", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "kukubla", "Title": "\u201cBid Disappointment\u201d", "Author": "kukubla", "ReviewID": "UR90348815", "Content": "This was our second stay at this hotel.

Dance floor or more private. Call ahead for a VIP experience, our guy called us to let us know our table was ready.

I love the casino as it is very open and has a high ceiling, so that the ventilation is superior to every casino I have been in. It can be very busy here but not crazy nuts like some of the other casinos. The rooms were always kept clean and well stocked. Requests for extra items were met promptly-like the need for a refrigerator for medications. I have to say we ate at Morel's French Steakhouse and were a little disappointed. Nothing was bad, just ordinary at a very expensive price. The only thing I would change is to bring the beds from Aria over-they are to die for.

Requested new room at front desk, and they could not provide it, because they were in a sold out situation. To me there is no excuse for this, they put an ionizer in the room for 2 hours, which was supposed to help. NOT. Nonetheless, I could not sleep the whole night. Was on the pool side floor, and had a room that opened up to the pool area (which I was told is a premium room). All it was, is a room that had a balcony on the same floor of the pool, and tucked into a corner where you could not see the pool. It was also very loud at night, so I was kept awake. BTW, smoking rooms are disgusting, they have a film of brown stuff everywhere, and if anyone tries to tell me that I am imagining it, just try to run a white cloth over the walls, you will see what I mean. You may ask, why didnt I go to another hotel? My company was providing the room, and would not be reimbursed for a different location...so I had to live with it. Yea, I suppose I could have made a big deal out of it, but that may be a career limiting move. So left it as is. Anyhow, the next day I got a new room on the 21st floor, which was a non-smoking room, it was cleaner, because of the lack of brown film. When I walked into the room, it smelled great! Like a steak cooking on a grill. This was nice for about 30 minutes, but the smell got to the point of excessive after a while, and would not go away. Almost like the vent to a grill was right outside of my window. WOW, this was awful, and of course, I could not get a new room. :( Anyhow, I lived with it, by forcing the fan on all the time (BTW, the cooling and heating will not work when you have the fan on all the time)...so I had to change the mode on the thermostat all the time to keep the room comfortable. This room was actually very nice, from a clean perspective, and \"look\", if you like the grandma style decor. It reminds me of when I was a little boy, and stayed at Grandma's house. The wall paper was similar to her home. The bathroom is very nice, clean, etc. The internet was awful! Very very slow, uselss as a matter of fact. The printer in the room did not work. I installed the drivers, the print job was sent to the printer, but nothing printed. Had to use the Kiosk downstairs to print out plane ticket when departing, cost 5.00 just to startup the session, then the keyboard did not work, so had to use another kiosk, which was another 5.00. What a rip! Room service is incredibly expensive. 1/2 pot of coffee 16.00 with delivery charge. Which will take at least 40 minutes to get. As a matter of fact, whenever I called for service of anykind, I would be put on hold for at least 5 minutes each time! Something that really frustrated me, was I had to walk through the casino everytime I went to a meeting, which has people smoking in it. I understand they need to entice everyone to gamble, but please dont make me have to walk through that smoke filled room to get to my meetings. Everytime I tried to find another route, I would get lost. Oh, and dont ask anyone how to get somewhere. I swear they are told to mis direct you so you end up walking aimlessly forever.

My friend lives in a $3500 a month apartment in NYC and this room blows it away. The staff I encountered were all wonderful, and the restaurants we ate at Lavo, and Grand Lux Cafe were both very good with terrific service.

There is no evidence that management communicates or there is any quality assurance program in place. Once you check in you will be given key cards and a crudely scrawled map to find your room. You will walk at least 1/2 mile through the casino to get to your room. There is a security guard to ensure that you can only order food from hotel restaurants. They check for room keys about 75% of the time. They are unable to get you into your room if the keys do not work and will refer you back to the front desk 1/2 mile away. They are unaware of the operating hours of most the restaurants. Once in your room, you are left to figure out where anything is, what amenities come with your room, the location of the safe and how to operate it. If you have medications that need to be refrigerated, you will need to bring your own cooler and good luck finding ice. If you desire a cup of coffee, you will need to go to a coffee shop on the casino level to purchase one as it is against policy for them to provide a coffee maker in the room. There are three TV's in the room. Each have access to different channels so if you start watching a show on one TV and want to continue watching as you bathe, it may not be possible. They don't seem to check the rooms closely (with the exception of the refreshment bar) after guest check out, sometimes the TV and/or the remotes do not work. There is an iron in the room, but the front desk staff do not know this. Check the iron before plugging it in because it may be damaged as mine was resulting in a large water spill on the floor. If they move your items for any reason, make sure you hand carry anything that can't take harsh treatment or you may find yourself with a broken laptop or other items with no recourse. They charge a resort fee for internet and access to a spa and pool. Good luck finding the spa and pool. It may be just for employees who know where it is located. The internet is included, but be ready for the computer glitch that requires you to accept charges. The front desk will tell you to accept the charges and they will take it off when you check out. Be sure to tell them or they might not. If you provide any feedback or comments, they will tell you that they will pass it on to the appropriate department, but there is no evidence that my concerns went anywhere but the shredder. They will make promises like the delivery of a daily newspaper or they will call you when they have acted on a request. You will not get a call or a newspaper. You may be told that after your stay you will get a feedback form in the mail. It's been 11 days and no feedback form. All in all, a beautiful room and view.

Took a taxi from LAS to the Palazzo which was less than 10mins with traffic and about 23.00 total w/ tip. We were greeted right away from the bell captain to the gentleman opening the front doors. At check-in, less than 5 minutes, we were greeted by our desk clerk and even the clerks to the L and R of him. We were offered an upgrade for an extra 100 per night to the Bella suite (Mt view) but declined it due to wanting a strip view and then like past resorts in which we have stayed, I slipped him 40 and then we were assigned suite 41-736 facing dead center of the TI across the street. I always believe if you take care of them, they will take care of you. To finish this, past reviews talk about how rude the front desks were, I think its more about the attitude of the ones typing the review! **41-736 was beautiful, clean, well furnished and very accomodating for us. I even looked for the things that others tend to pick out on here, but nothing was discovered. Well cleaned every a.m. and restocked with the basics. We always left a small tip in the room and it was well received by our attendant. **Casino at Pallazo, don't know where to start here but what a great time. I play in many different locations each year and this one besides Atlantis in the Bahamas really deserves 5 stars. From the Pit Boss, to the dealers, to the waitresses, they were friendly and waited on you hands down. Nice when your in Vegas, that the people call you by first name and they always asked how the stay was going. Take advantage of Grazie, its there for a reason and l will explain later. **Food was excellent wherever we ate, from Grand Lux to The Grill @ Valetino's and even the quick small coffee shop by elevators. Grand Lux was true comfort food at a reasonable price. **Checkout, how simple can it be. Like I stated earlier, get the Grazie card. I called the front desk at 930am, she transfered me to Casino Host/Services and within 3 minutes, our whole weekend was comped (1100) and was driven back to LAS in a private limo. No standing in lines for hours and fighting with management. Alot of reviews on here talk negative about the comp program with Grazie, not a single complaint here. **Lastly, I just wanted to give my view knowing how \"some\" just take everything to extremes.

This was my first time to Vegas. I don't like casinos, big cities, ritzy dining, or expensive shopping and I still had one of the best weekends ever! I came with a group of 10 women on business. We were there for an Invisalign convention held at the Venetian November 4-7. Arrival: We took an airport shuttle w/ several other groups and were dreading being the last to be dropped off, as the Palazzo is one of the furthest resorts from the airport. To our surprise, we were the first to be let off in a quick 10 mins. Check in: The line was outrageous (this conference was expecting several thousand to check in on the same day) but moved fast and we were checked into all 4 rooms unbelievably smoothly in another 5-10 minutes. Rooms: Spacious. With 4 girls in their 20s and 30s it usually gets crowded and chaotic. Not the case at this resort. The rooms are so big for the money. The bathrooms could be bigger, but with 4 girls getting ready in Vegas, we'd complain about any bathroom. Another prob w/ the bathroom is the shower is all glass. So we had to wait for everyone to shower before getting ready. Separate toilet-great. The room was perfect. Extremely clean. One of the perks of staying at a new resort. The location was okay. Not in the middle of the action which was the only downfall b/c we had never seen Vegas before and had to take a taxi everywhere. However, this was eventually a plus as we were sick of the crowds and our feet hurt so bad by day 3 were thrilled with taking taxi's. We ate at the Grand Lux Cafe in the hotel as soon as we checked in, again at 4:00 in the morning and for the next day's lunch. It's delicious. Owned by the same people that own Cheesecake Factory, there's something on the menu for everyone. The staff was extremely friendly and helpful. Our feet hurt so bad the last night from walking in heels we thought it'd be funny to ride up and down the strip in Rascals (motorized scooters). Guest services rented them to us for $40 per day!

Between that and the comfiness of the bed, I slept in until noon one day without even realizing it. The sitting area has a very comfortable L-shaped couch that was great for relaxing or napping. There were three flat screen TVs. Only a few complaints about the room: while generally quiet, there were a couple of noisy parties at at the pool that I could definitely hear from my room. The do not disturb sign was missing from my room. There was no coffee maker in the room, and there was no extra blanket. I entered the bathroom to find the toilet unflushed (!). The other people I was with found limes in their mini-fridge left over from a previous occupant. The room includes a printer/scanner/fax/copy machine, but I could not figure out how to work it and I couldn't find any instructions either. Room service was very expensive, even by room service standards. I splurged on breakfast and the total bill, for a standard bacon/eggs/hash brown/croissant/juice/coffee was $42 after the 18% gratuity and room service fee were included. It was very good, though. I found all of the staff to be very friendly and accomodating. There was a short wait to check in (around 3 pm on a Wednesday) and no wait to check out (around 6 am on a Sunday). The casino was very nice - again, without being too over the top or gaudy (the same cannot be said for the Wynn). The minimums on the tables were high, which was to be expected. There was a really great selection of slots, especially video poker and blackjack. Not very smoky at all. We ate at Zine one night and it was good. Also good was Grand Lux Cafe - which was casual and very reasonably priced. I found the location to be a little inconvenient, being towards the far north end of the strip.

We arrived to the hotel from the airport late in the afternoon and went in to the front desk to register. The front desk attendant matter-of-factly and unapologetically told us The Palazzo was overbooked and that we would have to stay at The Venetian instead. We were told there was no recourse in the matter, such as a refund so we could stay at another property. We were very disappointed by this as we had booked The Palazzo specifically and had planned our trip for quite some time. To add insult to injury, the front desk attendant seemed to be amused by our situation and asked us how we would be getting to our room, by taxi or shuttle, apparently since it was so far away. The front desk manager standing nearby seemed to find this humorous as well and although we usually have a good sense of humor, we were appalled and dismayed by their lack of tact and professionalism. It was embarrassing; I've never been treated like that before, especially at a high end hotel and casino. That evening we had dinner reservations and tickets to a show so we did not have time to press the matter further. I was able, however, to call the reservation line and we were told that there was availability at The Palazzo for the rest of our stay, contradicting the story we received from the front desk that the hotel was overbooked. The whole experience with the front desk left us with such a bad taste that I made reservations at another hotel the next day, The Four Seasons, where we had a great stay for the rest of our trip. (I can't recommend The Four Seasons enough, awesome place) I had read some bad reviews about The Palazzo before our trip and chalked it up to 'everybody has to get some bad reviews now and then'. Unfortunately the horror stories about arrogant, rude, and condescending staff were spot on. This attitude seems to permeate throughout the entire Palazzo/Venetian complex.

So we bought the two night Bordeaux package and upgraded to Prestige. A mere $660 prepay rate for two nights. In Vegas, that's steep, but having stayed on Ritz Carlton club levels around the world, we figured it would be an equally sublime experience. We requested a room with a strip view by email in advance of arrival. Upon arrival it was denied. We had a room instead with a perfect view of Wynn/Encore which left us laughing. The rooms are very spacious and well appointed in both the Venetian, where we have stayed previously and the Palazzo. Almost identical. The maid service is also very good. We had no complaints whatsoever regarding the rooms or maid service. For the Bordeaux package, we received a bottle of wine each night from Bordeaux. You can buy the bottles retail if you search Google for a whopping $12 and $15 respectively. Now, why on earth would Palazzo want to sell an expensive wine package and then embarass themselves serving cheap grocery quality wine? Mind you the fancy french reds came with a cheese plate and some fruit. This was a major disappointment but has proven great fodder when talking with our friends who are all foodies. They're as shocked as we were. And if a bottle retails for $12 or $15 you know the hotel is paying 1/2 or less! On the Presitge level, $100 additional per night, the rooms are EXACTLY THE SAME as other hotel rooms. No upgraded amenities or linens. You are offered bottled water or a glass of champagne at check-in. They also offer continental breakfast in the morning, which was a cattle call. Pastry, cereal, oatmeal, fruit if the plates aren't empty and juice. NO hot entree items and no mimosas. If you are counting on a Ritz Carlton club level experience you are in for a definite surprise. In the late afternoon and early evening there are two hours where you can have comped cocktails on Prestige. We had one cocktail each and then headed to dinner or shows. They do offer a hot hor s deouvre or two during this period of time. And be prepared, the help will watch their clocks closely not starting the free cocktail service too soon and ending promptly. Some people sat at the bar and tried hard to get their $100 worth of liquor and they may actually have accomplished the task. For us, there are plenty of free cocktails on the gaming floor, so we didn't find this a great value. In the evening there are desserts for another two hour period of time. 7 pm to 9 pm. We arrived on one evening at 8:30 pm and the help said they were out of desserts but they had cookies! Whoopee! Seriously, that's a major gaffe and shows tremendous lack of managerial oversight that employees would be acting in that manner. There are also some public computer terminals in the Prestige lounge and for those who need unpacking services you can request help when checking in. Upon check out our bill had jumped...just a tad. We had only charged a $187 meal at Morels, an excellent French inspired restaurant, and no other charges, but we were presented with a $1400+ bill that the clerk could not explain to my satisfaction. Once he was fully aware I had prepaid $660 for both nights he screwed his face up and tried to fix the bill. Then came a manager named Nathan who whipped out a Sharpie permanent marker and had trouble making heads of tails of the bill. He did understand that we had fully prepaid $660 for the two night stay called the Bordeaux Package. The more he did math games on the bill the more confusing it became. Neither Nathan, nor myself or the clerk could come up with a final answer. After 20 minutes of this nonsense he sent me away and said he would fix it and give me a call to confirm the bill was fixed. Well, that was over a month ago and no phone call from Mr. Chapas. But AMEX confirms it is fixed. Can you imagine checking out of Ritz Carlton or better yet the Encore across the street and standing like an idiot at the counter while two different staff members try to sort out your bill for 20 minutes. I kept thinking Ashton Kutcher was going to pop out from the tv show, Punk'D. While the hotel is nice enough, we certainly had what I would call a corked stay. It clearly was not worth $660 for two nights. If anyone is planning on staying at this property, just get the base room and spend the least amount possible. Don't buy the Bordeaux Package unless you love cheap wine. Don't expect or ask for an upgrade regardless of the reason. If you think the various freebies of Prestige warrant an extra $100/night, then book it and enjoy, but for us it was a lot of fluff that we didn't use or need or care about. For some people, that have not experienced other club levels, it was apparent they thought it was the greatest thing since sliced bread. I would encourage those people to visit a Ritz Carlton or Four Seasons club level and luxuriate in the differences. And for overall atmostphere and complete ease of checking in and out I would suggest the Encore Towers.

Other than that, what a beautiful place. This is a newer casino that is connected to the Venetian, which is also a beautiful casino. It's located on the north end of the strip. When you walk in you know that this place was built with elegance in mind. When we checked in there was a small wait, maybe 5-10 minutes. The individual who checked in was very friendly and we were off to our room quickly. In the rooms the living room area is sunken about a foot which gives the feeling that the bedroom area and living room are two different rooms. The bathroom, which has a larger stand up shower, tub and two sink vanity was top notch. The street view of the room at night was pretty impressive. I had a front row seat to the treasure of island show. The pool was pretty small and due to the way that the sun rises and the position of the hotel, the pool area isnt in the sun until somewhere around noon. There are also a couple of other little pools that were closed. I believe that they were only open during special events. But, because the Palazzo and Venetian are owned together you can use the facilities from either property. So, when we went swimming early we went to the Venetian pool. Parking was pretty easy and free. And the walk from the parking lot to the casino to the room was about 5 minutes. The hotel is not a party hot spot and I would say that this place is more targeted for the non-party and older types, which suited me just fine. All of the staff were friendly and were helpful. Not one single complaint about the staff. Overall I'm giving the hotel 4 stars. If it werent for the pool being way too small and the fact that the sun doesnt touch the pool area until late morning/early afternoon, I would have put 5 starts.

We have stayed previously at the Venetian and enjoyed it, so we gave the sister hotel a try. Check in was smooth, and we were able to get into a room right away even though we were early. The rooms, being newer, were a bit more updated and \"warmer\" in color scheme compared to the Venetian. Bed was high quality pillow top and very comfortable. Rooms and bathrooms were sparkling. Unlike many strip hotels, we never heard noise from the hallways - what a pleasure! Very nice and active pool area - great for relaxing and watching people going by. We ate at the GrandLux cade a couple of times. Unlike most of the hotels on the strip, there is no massive buffet to chow down on. However, there is a nice breakfast buffet that has plenty of options, but not to the extent of others on the strip. The price at about $16 per person was also reasonable for a higher end locaiton. The Palazzo and Venetian carry alot of traffic - these are convention hotels attached to the Sands CC. The place is very busy at all times - and the casino seemed a bit smokier than it was on previous stays. The Wynn and Encore casino's by contrast are a bit more sedate. Hotel security was reasonably decent, with someone checking for room keys 24/7. Nothing stops you from keeping a keycard and going up anytime, but at least there is an effort being made. A bit irritating, but it reflects today's times, a picture ID is required for any purchase using your room account. So be sure to take your ID with you to the pool etc. - otherwise, no purchases! We caught Jersey Boys and it is a fun musical, if you like the Four Season and Frankie Valli stuff. Very professional and well done.

If the Palazzo had even asked us how our stay was at check out, they would have had the opportunity to remedy the situation, and I would be writing a different review. A questionnaire was emailed to me two weeks after my stay, and a hotel manager did not contact me even after I again listed the problems with the stay. I am a 41 year old frequent business and pleasure traveler with 100 hotel stays a year, and over 35 cruises to date. I am a Platinum Elite member of Intercontinental Hotels Group and a Triple Platinum Milestone Elite member of Carnival Cruise Lines. My wife was with me for this stay. The customer service received at this hotel was absolutely sub par and certainly not worthy of their four-star rating. The room amenities and room layout were superb, but the positive review ends there. During our stay, we found numerous problems with the room. At a hotel of this stature, all of the room amenities should be inspected prior to each new guest. 1. We found a large leather bag in the night stand which contained four dildos/sex toys, numerous bottles of lube, and a plethora of batteries. This obviously brought into question how thoroughly the room was cleaned prior to our visit. When I notified the front desk, they took absolutely no action. In fact, we left the bag right where we found it to see if our complaint would prompt them to clean properly for the next guest. I am adding a photo of these items for anyone questioning this review. I am also amused to see if the posing of this review and the image would finally prompt a contact from hotel management. 2. The motorized curtains were not working. (Maintenance did fix this upon request) 3. The room thermostat was broken and registering a room temperature about 6 degrees lower than actual room temperature. In other words, we had to set it to 65 to get a room temperature of 71, and as such when it displayed the room as 65 degrees, it was actually 71 in the room. (My travel alarm clock registers room temp.) 4. The bathroom scale was broken. 5. The DVD player in the room had no remote control, which made it non-functional for any DVD that has an initial menu. (No buttons on the player itself) 6. The room business center had a non functional printer, and no printer paper supply. 7. Several room light bulbs were burned out. 8. There was broken glass in the carpet which was found by my getting cut in bare feet. The room was clearly not cleaned correctly following a glass accident by one of the previous occupants. 8. And the worst issue, we saw a baby German cockroach crawling in the bathroom which disappeared through a crack in the baseboard. Most if not all of these issues were reported to the desk. Most issues went unresolved with no contact from anyone. Upon checkout, I was awaiting the representative to ask me how our stay was. Incredibly, she did not do so! I cannot stress enough that in decades of travel, I have never, ever not been asked how my stay was at any property. What is even more puzzling is the absolute lack of contact from hotel management or customer service on any of these issues. I have never before encountered a total lack of interest when the rare problem has arisen during one of my stays with even the lower rated hotels. Incredibly, I'm certain if we had found a bag containing sexual items in any other property in the United States the hotel management would be beside themselves with embarrassment over the issue. At the Palazzo we received absolutely no contact about it whatsoever. I must highly recommend that the reader choose a competing hotel when contemplating the Palazzo if customer service and room cleanliness is of concern. Anyone can also contact me personally for additional details if you like.

I'm a regular Vegas visitor and enjoy my stays at most of the hotels I've been at. Palazzo is the first time I've stayed at any hotel chain a second time (I was at the Venetian previously). All in all I had fun and the hotel is beautiful, the rooms are clean and luxurious, room service is relatively prompt, but I came across a serious Customer Service issue at checkout that I believe all need to be aware of. -On that Saturday night, there was a fire in the parking garage and cars were not allowed into the driveway. However, Security neglected to inform us (something we found out the next day), that pedestrians can walk up to the hotel. Instead, we were turned away in our cab at 2 a.m. to circle the streets for over an hour (a $100+ cab fare) until the hotel was reopened to cars. -We brought this to the attention of the Front Desk manager AL SANTOS when we were checking out. At first, he denied that the hotel was not letting cars access the hotel and that there was a fire. We were bewildered. He kept insinuating that we were inventing the story to get credits to our room. After us starting to get upset about his behavior and treatment, a front desk representative leaned over and updated him about the fire. He apologized. He proceeded to get a Security guard to watch us, while he went to get claim forms for us to document our complain. Strike 1. -I asked to have the room credit to be put on my Grazie card and after being told at check in, during my stay and at the Grazie counter that it won't be a problem, he proceeded to tell me that it was impossible b/c I'm a secondary on the room and not a primary. I asked him to change that - He threw a fuss, and then relented. I checked the next day and my Grazie card was never credited. Strike 2. - Then he charged the wrong credit card for the room. After I asked him about it, he lost his temper and berated me about that being the credit card the reservations were made with. I informed him that another credit card was submitted at check in and CHARGED already. He refunded the initial card and proceeded to re-charge the second card. I left that day with my card being charge double the room charge. When I kept explaining that he was double charging me, he started loosing it again and informing me in the most derogatory manner that this was standard procedure. Strike 3! -I leave the hotel finally (after over 1.5 hours at checkout). On the road I call the reservations department to reverse those double charges, which I had confirmed with my bank at that point) b/c it was causing overdraft charges on my bank account. I came across another Manager, Michelle who offered to call the bank to verify whether any overdraft charges had occured and if we had charged more than we owed. 15 minutes after I speak with Michelle, AL SANTOS called me, yelling and insulting me for speaking to another manager about the double charges, informing me that Michelle works UNDER him and that he never double charged me. I reiterated that I checked my account online and I was double charged, but he wasn't listening, he just kept screaming at me. STRIKE 4! Well, at this point I was angry and I asked for the next Manager up. She (Nicole) was not available and I was told she would call me on the next business day. It's been over a week, I've called her myself again, and have STILL not heard from her. Yeah, so a whole lot of yelling by customer service. It ruined my entire stay at the Palazzo and my entire view of the hotel. I have never heard of Customer Service reps screaming at customers and being so uninformed about the happenings at their hotel. If you have no complications, I guess it's ok to stay there. Otherwise, management is one unreliable rude group to interact with at the Palazzo.", "Date": "October 12, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Asheboro, North Carolina", "Title": "\u201cGot to stay here- don't go elsewhere- you need to read this\u201d", "Author": "nceyedoc", "ReviewID": "UR83127285", "Content": "I read others reviews of the Palazzo before I made our reservations, and did not have any problems with the hotel at all. Let me start by saying I planned my trip and attractions based on these reviews from others and want my review to help people. The Palazzo is great. First there was no problem with check in, done in 3 minutes. You have to walk thru the casino to get to the guest elevators, but not bad because they have a smoke free walk way thru which was nice. You have to show your room key to the security guard near the elevators, just hold it up and keep going. The elevator area has 3 groups of 8 elevators. 1 group is floor 1-25, 1 group 25-36?, other 37?-50, so there was never waiting more than 20 seconds ever, and typically you were by your self because of 8 elevators for only your floors. Yes, the hall ways are long and we were the next to last room 31-736. The room was great, from the big bathroom to the extra sitting area, to the electric curtains. Our view was directly infront of treasure Island. They have the Sirens of TI nightly which you really could not see the detail of the actors but could hear the cannons some- but not enough to wake you or bother any at all. The bed was comfy, yes, table had some scratches, etc, but top notch. There is only a minibar refrigerator which is weighted. Also infront of the TV is boxes of nuts, candy, etc which are weighted . The front desk said if you pick up and it stays gone for over 20 seconds they will charge you, I picked up to boxes, replaced before I knew of the charge, but the front desk said it must not have been off long enough so was not charged. There is an ice machice down the hall room 31-710 which has its own door and the door closed quietly, so I don't think even if you were near it it would bother you. The floors all around inside and out were very clean. There is a Walgreens attached to the lower left side(when you walk out the front entrance) outside of the hotel which is 24 hours. We went there the first night, got water, cokes, snacks and brought a collapsable cooler, filled it with Ice and it worked great because there ewas no refrigerator for you to use in room. The casino is very nice and not real crowded compared to others we visited and not near as smokey. If you like to smoke Bally's, treaseure Island, is for you. We went to the Jubille show which was ok, but the theater smelled like smoke which if you had a breathing problem, you could not stay in ther thru the show-really-Compared to the other Casino, common area, the Palazzo is so much nicer, the Venetian similiar , but not as nice . I would definately go back. There is a bridge at Walgreens that you can walk over to the treasure island and a bridge to the other side across the streeet to the Whyn. There is also 2 taxi stands to take 1 at front door, another at the lower level which is accessed going down the escalator in the main check in area and out side. We also rented a car from avis which is on site at the lower taxi stand outside of the Palazzo, which was great and flawless transaction. Also went to the canyon ranch Spa which was first class and would recommend. Please see my reviews of attractions we went to which I feel will help you choose what to see. We also used Presidential Limos for the trip to and from the airport. This went flawlessly. The driver was at the baggage claim area as described with my name on a sign. He helped us with our bags, went to the limo, opened a bottle of champ. and gave my wife a rose(just as described on their web site). On the way back we requested a 4:40am pick up, he showeed up at exactly 4:40am at the lower taxi area and we got to the airport without problems. If this is your first time in Vegas, this is the way to go and then rent a car from Avis onsite to go to the Hoover Dam, etc. and drop it off the day before you leave. We definately will stay her again and use the same services above.

If you are looking for a nice place to sleep for a few hours then get a cheaper room. It was very nice but I don't know that it was worth $700 bucks/night.

I cannot fathom why people would give this place a bad review. Ok, if you were robbed by house keeping, I understand. Other than that, step down off your high horse and enjoy your vacation. I have been many places and stayed at many properties Vegas and beyond (4 to 5 stars). The Venitian was my favorite until now. The Palazzo was fabulous- and let me tell you why. Originally, I had one night booked at the Bellagio, but I ended up cancling and I'm glad I did. The single thing that makes this property different is the fact that the standard room is a suite and is freakishly HUGE! Sure you can get a suite at the Bellagio, but you will pay an arm and leg for it. Also, the property is NEW. I appreciate \"old world charm\" and \"classic style\" like the next person. But, I don't think the Bellagio should be charging $300 a night and I'm still watching old school \"fat back\" televisions. Not at the Palazzo, 3, count em, 3 FLAT screen HD tvs: one in the bedroom, living room and bathroom (that's right bathroom)! That being said, the review. Check in- Smooth as can be (and early)! The line was long, but I STILL only waited maybe 15 minuites tops, due to all the agents availiable. My room was on the 49th floor with an outstanding view of the strip at my request. Room- what can i say huge, lovely, relaxing. I was traveling with two girlfriends, when they left, i actually felt like the room was too big, The bathroom was well lit and gorgeous, the shower and the toilet was seperate. Everything was clean. The houskeeping staff was friendly and professional. When I called t the front desk for anythng, it was brought immediately. Any abundance of toiletries were provided without request based on the women in the room. Bathrobes and slippers (realLY?) We used the pools at the Venitian and went to TAO Beach awsome! It was a Tuesday, so on a crowded day it would problably be a pain in the ***- or more expensive. Shopping and dining- Shopping was bananas! There is a mall right in the Palazzo with a lot o great shops BeBe, Barney's etc. The Grand Lux Cafe is the greatest for inexpensive early or late nite dining. The menu is like 18 pages lol. They have one at the Venitian too which is 24hrs. Dos Comos, the Mexican resturant is fantastic! The open face shrimp quesidillas melt in your mouth. Go to Madame Tussauds Wax Museum- it was a blast! Didn't think I would enjoy it as much as I did. Casino- it was a nice size; but still intimate and not smoky- loved it. The pit bosses were a little snooty, but no biggie. Misc- I was on the 49th floor, and it never took more than a few second to get to my floor, no waiting for elevators, that was amazing to me :) Summary- I'm a little torn, I'm one of those people who like to try someplace different when i travel, but I will definately be staying at the Palazzo on my next trip to Las Vegas!", "Date": "October 8, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Martinsburg, West Virginia", "Title": "\u201cAwesome\u201d", "Author": "4ever-us-1106", "ReviewID": "UR82524176", "Content": "The Palazzo is a very intriguing hotel resort!

However, my spouse and I did not take advantage of the strip view, nonetheless, the view was still breathtaking with the expanse of the mountains surrounding the desert in the background. The Palazzo and the Venetian Hotel are adjoined and share many wonderful shops, resturants, and not to mention, a Venetian scene with Gondola rides, and a simulated sky with moving clouds. Words cannot describe the elaborate taste of this hotel, you would have to see it for yourself. My spouse and I are looking forward to our next trip to Las Vegas and we would stay nowhere else but at the fabulous Palazzo Hotel and Resort!", "Date": "October 7, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "los angeles,ca", "Title": "\u201cCovered all the bases and then some...\u201d", "Author": "kimmiser", "ReviewID": "UR82514718", "Content": "We met some family and friends in Las Vegas for a week this August.

We booked with Virgin and we got complimentary entry to the V Room which was excellent, food, service and setting. The 10 hr flight was very comfortable and service and entertainment was excellent. It was our first time in Las Vegas and we were slightly sceptical especailly after reading some of the reviews but we need not have worried as it surpassed all our expectations. The Pallazo was a fab place to stay, we had a suite on 42 floor with fantastic views of the strip and a full view of the show at the Treasure Island. The staff were very helpful, friendly and very prompt, they were all lovely. We walked the lenght of the strip and found that there was a vast contrast on both ends. The end of the strip that starts at Circus Circus is old and tired and like Blackpool, UK on a bigger scale, its dirty and completely run down. The other end is the lap of luxury and the Pallazo is simply fantastic. We stayed for 5 nights and packed a lot in, highlights were the sunset tour of the grand canyon, limo pick up, helicopter to canyon, champagne picnic in the canyon and then ride over the strip at night, truly amazing. We had VIP seats at the Jersey Boys show which was a fantastic show, would recommend 100%. The gondala ride at the Venetian was really good, we rode outside as there is also an indoor area. The dolphins at the Secret Gardens at the Mirage was a lovely experience. We had a night a Freemont Street which was very entertaining. Breakfast buffet at the Bellagio is the best ever and reasonably priced, you will be full for the day. Zine restaurant at the Pallazo was excellent and also the Italian at the Fashion Show Mall. A visit to see Big Elvis at Bills Gambling Hall is a must, free show and cheap beer. We didnt have time to gamble except for 10 minutes on the slots, won nothing! All in all a fantastic place to visit and would thoroughly recommend a stay at the Pallazo.", "Date": "October 6, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "YLW", "Title": "\u201cSpacious, Fun, Good Value and Great Room Service\u201d", "Author": "jfuller77", "ReviewID": "UR82209461", "Content": "Loved the Palazzo!

We stayed for four nights from Sept. 27th, 2010 to October 1, 2010. Overall, we were highly impressed by the hotel, the service, and the amenities available. Arrival: We took a shuttle from the airport. The shuttles are run by Executive Shuttles from gate 8. It is $6 per person each way, and transports you directly to the Venetian and Palazzo. One note is that the shuttle will stay at the airport until it fills up with passengers, so I hope you are not the first one on the shuttle. BTW, the return shuttle leaves on the hour from a side entrance. Check In: We had booked the Palazzo with a package that gave us preferred check in. I would highly recommend booking directly through the hotel with their package deals if you are staying weekdays, as these have a lot of bonuses. Our package gave us $30 food credit daily, a suite upgrade, and $50 towards the spa, as well as some casino credit - not bad for $139 a night. We also had preferred check in, which helped us to get our room for an early arrival. We brought our 1 yr old with us, so we were able to get a minifridge and crib added to the room, and the snacks from the room removed. Normally, they charge $20 to get the snacks removed, but they comped us that fee, since all the snacks are on sensors, and with a toddler, we would have been charged regularly. The whole hotel smells good - we found the spray scent they use pleasant, unlike some of the musty or smoke filled places in Las Vegas. Room: Our room was a Deluxe King, which is their standard room. Their standard room is HUGE! The living room gave the little one plenty of room to roam, which was a huge bonus for us. There was a comfortable couch, and a leather coffeetable/ottoman area ideal for putting your feet on. We had a room on the 42nd floor with a perfect view of the Treasure Island and Mirage evening shows. Our daughter loved to look out the window and exclaim, \"ooh!\" - her parents did, too! Each room also has a remote controlled curtain and shade - she had fun playing with that remote as well. There were flatscreens in the living room, bedroom, and bathroom. ESPN while showering is a new guilty pleasure! The room was clean, quiet, and comfortable. The bed and sheets were excellent. On the downside, the shower was not very powerful, there is no coffeemaker in the room, and the seperate room for the toilet was poorly lit. There is a daily resort fee, which gave us internet and pool access, but we never received the daily newspaper that is supposed to come for that fee. Dining: Most of the restaurants in this hotel are in the overly expensive area - if you are willing to pay $200 for a world class steak, you have come to the right place. This is not our preference, however. One restaurant, the Grand Lux Cafe, had excellent food at reasonable prices. Their breakfast buffet each morning was filled with healthy and not so healthy options. We went there for dinners and lunches as well, and were never disappointed. Many meals and desserts are gargantuan sized - we would often split the salads, for instance. Grand Lux is based off of Cheesecake Factory, but the meals are higher in quality and slightly pricier. Service was excellent, and there are tons of choices for your meal. They are the one restaurant in the Palazzo that will do takeout as well. Pool: There are multiple pools in the complex between the Venetian and the Palazzo. Most of them do not get sun until about 11am. It was warm and sunny while we were in Las Vegas, not surprisingly. The pool we were in had side sections that were only one and a half feet deep - perfect for lounge chairs and toddling children with toys. Being out of direct sunlight until the afternoon was an unexpected bonus for us. Sun lovers could head to the Venetian for late morning sun. Spa: My wife went to the spa for a massage and facial. She felt the quality of the massage and facial were only average at best, were overpriced, and the receptionist staff within the spa were rude and snooty. They made a big fuss over accepting the promo coupon from the Palazzo, whcih definitely did not make for a relaxing experience. Supposedly, Canyon Ranch is one of the top spas in the world, but it did not come close to meeting those expectations. Casino: What makes the Palazzo special is that even thought the casino area is one of the largest, it does not feel large. The whole place, despite being made to feel luxurious, still retained a comfortable, cozy feel. This is very different that the feel within the Venetian, where you feel like there are slot machines crammed everywhere. If you do gamble, make sure to get in on the Grazie program and the Pocket Casino concepts to get comps. Overall, I would highly recommend the Palazzo, and would return.

I reserved through the Palazzo's own website where I think the offers were as good or better than through intermediaries. I booked a two-night stay in a Bella suite with a view of the Strip (I had to ask when we checked in), and I paid the extra amount for the \"Prestige\" option which was more than returned in the \"extras\" we enjoyed. Specifically, we had access to the Prestige Lounge on the 23rd floor, where we had a very complete breakfast each morning (hard-boiled eggs, no hot food, but lots of fruit, breads, pastries, yogurt, etc.); coffee and tee in mid-afternoon; free cocktails and snacks in the early evening; and desserts from 7 to 8 pm. We enjoyed the relaxed atmosphere and NOT having to find a cafe/restaurant for each meal/snack. One of the perks of the Prestige package is being able to register on the 23rd floor, instead of in the main lobby. Somehow this was not pointed out in the confirmation I received, and so we missed a useful service. So be sure to get details of what is included in your package, and how to obtain each perk. My one quibble is that there is no good excuse for leaving piles of linens in the hallway for hours, in a hotel that has 24-hour housekeeping serve. Our room was made up in mid-afternoon the second day, at our request. When we returned at 11 pm, the pile of linen was in the hallway; and next door was another pile of linen and the remains of a room-service meal.

My flight was a late flight, so I called the hotel to make sure I would get my king non-smoking suite, as I had already paid a night's deposit. I was assured on the phone the late check in would be \"no problem\". Well thanks to Delta and a 90 minute wait for our luggage, we got to the hotel after midnight. When we went to check in, we were told \"unfortunately, we don't have any king non-smoking suites\". The original clerk checking us in was pleasant enough but the \"manager\" she brought out when we were not understanding how this could happen was extremely hostile and rude. In all my extensive travel, it was the worst check in experience I have EVER had. The manager tried to say she'd \"upgrade\" us to a king the next day...the king we had reserved, and already paid a deposit on! They told us there wasn't a single king suite available the night we arrived. Right. So we went to the queen suite for the night, and it was 78 uncomfortable degrees...and we couldn't adjust the thermostat! So a very u restful, hot night. They did move our luggage to our new king suite later that day. The room we should have had from the start was very nice, and everything was functional. We avoided touching anything in the fridge, thanks to previous trip advisor reviews warning us of the exorbitant prices of those items. It was a bummer there is no fridge that is useable for water or leftovers. When we went to use the TV check out system it was 11:00am and they had turned off cable in the room, so we could not check out that way. We had to call downstairs, and spent almost 15 minutes on the phone. Lastly, the room was clean, but the hotel areas had some inconsistencies.

The gal at the desk let us know that a room was available for early checkin which was nice. Since we booked on Priceline we had to pay the $17/day resort fee which gives you access to the internet in your room and to the gym and pool. No option to refuse was given as previously noted.

The room we got was at the end of the hall so no slamming doors were heard, nor any walking drunks in the night. The bathroom was awesome (same as all the 5 stars though, tub, walkin shower, seperate toilet room, two sinks). 3 tv's in the room is nice to have too. The bed was very comfortable, and we checked for bed bugs, none found, and its been 5 days since we are home, none found. The keys to the room worked everytime, one hint, it beeps then open...haha. There is a remote for the blinds, very cool touch. Don't know about the restaurants here since we were elsewhere to eat (the buffett at the Wynn/Encore is great especially the desserts). The shopping in the Palazzo and Venetian is top notch, if you can't find what you need go across the street to the Fashion Mall, or down the way to Caesars' Forum Shops.

A few hints: There is a Walgreens on the strip street level in front of the Palazzo, go there to save a ton of money on water and other goodies. Do NOT take one of those cheesy buses from the airport to get to the hotel. They cost more for two people then a cab does, not to mention the hour and half it took to get to the hotel versus the 10 minutes for a cab. Ouch.

Some examples off the top of my head: -The hot/cold taps were reversed in one sink (but oddly, not the other). -The toiletries provided had caps that were almost impossible to remove with wet hands...and whose hands are dry when one is shampooing?! -They didn't think to add noise-dampening insulation around what I assume was an ice machine, so any room (like mine) within shouting distance of it heard a loud rumbling each time ice was dispensed. At least, I HOPE that was an ice machine...! If this were a Ramada Inn, I would be giving it five stars. But it's not. It's the Palazzo. They should get these things right.", "Date": "September 25, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Michigan", "Title": "\u201chad no complaints, except...\u201d", "Author": "lovesvegaslongtime", "ReviewID": "UR80986211", "Content": "Just got back from two nights at Palazzo (comped).

Specifically asked for seats (which are assigned)with all day sun. After an hour we were in the shade. Asked the 3 staff just standing and chatting at the entrance twice to be moved to obviously empty seats. Never happened.

My experience of the hotel was overall very positive in that the staff were extremely polite and attentive and especially so during check-in when I was given a high floor and strip view for no extra cost.The view of the city lights at night from 40 floors up is spectacular! I did mention during my on-line booking that we were a honeymooning couple and to their credit the Palazzo did respond. The room itself was excellent as it was extremely large and well appointed with 3 tv`s, a small dining table and even a fax/copier. The bathroom was expansive, with his & hers hand-basins and I have to say that watching tv while taking a shower was an indulgent pleasure. It would be easy to make the odd criticism of a less than perfectly clean corner sofa or the slightly fraying carpet but overall I was very impressed with the standard of the fittings and how quiet the room was. The room really was a peaceful and tranquil retreat from the madness that Vegas can be. One mistake I did make however was inspecting the luxury boxes of sweets and nibbles next to the lounge tv without realising that I was immediately being charged for them. They sit on a pressure sensitive pad and they are very expensive( I was however refunded in full by a very accomodating check-out clerk..another brownie point for the Palazzo!) For me, the only real but very important let-down was the pooldeck. When I arrived on the Wednesday afternoon I was informed by a guest in an elevator that ALL the pools in the resort,including the Venetian were closed until the Friday morning.This was confirmed to me at check-in when I later complained and I was FURIOUS! An event was apparently being conducted that meant that all 12 pools in the Palazzo, the Venetian and the Venezia were out-of-bounds to paying guests. When I did make my complaint the desk clerk did offerme a 50 dollar food credit and a free late check out which did go some way to calming me down. It would have been much more professional however to inform me of this event when I checked in. My issue with the Palazzo pool-deck, when it was available, was that the huge hotel tower casts a giant shadow across the pool deck and therefore early in the day everyone is crowded into one small sunny area. As the beds are jammed up against each other anyway, which is typical of Vegas hotels, the whole situation is quite claustrophobic. There is little shade and the cabanas are 500 dollars a day! Although the Palazzo boasts 7 pools, only one of them is of a decent size, the other 6 being almost ornamental. I feel that this aspect of the resort is a major let-down as I have stayed at the Mirage and Caesars Palace and their pools are massively sized with interesting features such as water fallsand rock pools. The Palazzo casino was excellent in that it never really felt crowded, cigarette smoke was pretty much non-existent and I was even served drinks as I played the slots, a benefit generally kept for the table gamblers. We saw the resident show, the Jersey Boys and really enjoyed it, the guy playing Frankie Valli had a fantastic voice. Tickets from Tix4Tnite near Dennys were well discounted but the seats were a bit far back for my liking. In closing, I have visited Vegas many times as it is one of my favourite places in the world, I love the buzz, the energy and all the many distractions and attractions, but I have to say that certain resorts such as the Mirage and Treasure Island, old favourites of mine are beginning to show their age. The other disappointment is that given the state of the world economy, many hotels are practically giving rooms away in the hope that guests will pay their way by gambling.This has resulted in Vegas attracting a certain social class that previously haven`t been able to afford to visit. I saw one of the Cirque de Soliel shows and a family brood numbering 2 adults and heaven knows how many kids were ruining the show running up and down the aisles and shouting during the performance. The Mexicans who flick pornographic cards in your face have returned with a vengeance and in general the streets and some of the hotels have become very tacky. My love affair with Vegas may be coming to an end and that is depressing. It will probably be a good few years before I return again if ever, but having said that,if you`ve never been, please try it, there really isn`t anywhere like it in the world. I hope this long meandering review proves useful to you.

The hotel is quite elegant with its Italian-themed decor, and I particularly appreciate the high ceilings in the casino area - gives everything more of a bright, open feel versus the cave-like dark settings of most of the casinos in LV. The highlight of the hotel are the spacious rooms which are more like suites. The 'regular' room there is extra-large with a sunken living room, three TVs, great bathroom with double sink, soaking tub and separate shower (I love the bathroom). Best of all it was quiet!!!! The hotel was particularly crazy/busy since I was there over the Labor Day weekend holiday - but, once in the room, it was complete bliss. We slept great! The other great thing about the Palazzo is the shopping options - without leaving the Palazzo/Venetian complex, there are myriad stores for hours of exploring - this and endless options for dining. I do agree w/other reviews that the rooms are starting to show a bit of wear and tear - hopefully the hotel will attend to this in the near future.", "Date": "September 6, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Fairfax, Virginia", "Title": "\u201cExcellent stay at the Palazzo\u201d", "Author": "BlueRTA", "ReviewID": "UR78410516", "Content": "We spent an entire week at the Palazzo in a Luxury View suite.

The hotel compared favorably to other luxury properties and the selection of restaurants was excellent. The spa featured a great fitness center (use included in the resort fee). Both the Venetian and Palazzo pools are accessible from the pool deck, so it is easy to find sun at any time of day. Room service was also nice, we ordered breakfast and were happy.

The hotel is proud of their air ventiliation system and the fragrance that is emitted - but it has a cloying sweet smell that gets old after a while. I stayed on the 38th floor with a view of the back of the hotel - the mountains are attractive, but the main feature is a huge ugly white roof of some building next door - not very scenic. Did not want to pay $50 extra per night for strip view. The bed is comfortable, but you get tiny little lumpy pillows. I could not get the room temperature right - I was always either too hot or too cold, and the air conditioning system is loud. My room had some wear and tear - the couch was missing buttons, the marble had been stained, the TV console had broken hardware, and the light over the table was broken. A console in the bed area had a switch for some missing element, and a light feature between the double beds had no switch to turn it on. You pay $15 per day to use Internet. The bathroom is quite nice, but the commode is in a separate small hot room with dim lighting and dubious toilet water pressure - and a door that insists on slamming shut. The hotel swells on weekends starting Friday nights and hoards of trashy drunken partiers take over the casino and run amok in the hallways to the wee hours. Note that in a security effort you are constantly asked to show your room card to gain acess to the elevators. I was at the hotel on business and needed to wake up early on a Sat morning to catch a flight - but I had no sleep Friday night because of the raucus party people on the floor and loud thumpa-thumpa music until 4 in the morning. I reported the noise to security who told me they could not find where the noise was coming from and seemed indifferent to my plight . The room doors close loudly and you cannot manually close them quietly so all night long you hear door slams on the floor. The check in staff are curt and seem to have a blase \"I've heard it all before\" attitude. You are warned not to touch any of the mini-bar items as the minute you do you will be charged because they are weight sensitive. Watch out for the hotel bottle of water - the mini-bar menu is not clear that you will pay $5 for that water (the menu looks like you only pay for the Fiji water, but no, you pay for the hotel bottle as well.) You are given a small map of the hotel layout that makes no sense and does not have any detail, making finding things very difficult. The map has conference room numbers, but when you go to the conference room area the rooms are first by name and then number. I was mis-directed twice in trying to find a restaurant and ended up wandering about for a long time. Checking in took over 20 minutes and there is not enough staff working the desk. Strangely, you do not receive your bill under the door, you have to manually check out - which adds time. Note that the airport shuttle service runs only on the hour on weekends. The main pool is just a big rectangle; there is a strange little pool by some cabana rooms, and a smaller rectangular pool at the rear. All in all not a very inspired pool area. The Canyon Ranch has two work out rooms - one small one by the entrance, and a larger one that is a long walk away.

Very classy hotel with amenities, food and service all top-notch. The room we received (their basic suite) was just about the size of the last apartment that my husband and I rented for a year before our house was built (700 sq ft). Baths were luxurious, with separate shower and soaking tub, TV, and makeup table. Beds were so comfortable the only way we could get ourselves out of bed each morning was to use our remote control to open the curtains. Every employee was personable (from the great staff at the Grand Lux Cafe to the security staff to the pool attendants). The pool area was beautiful; several different sizes and types of pools to suit couples and families. We put our chaise lounges in the pool and just spent 3 hours laying out in the sun, still keeping cool because we were an inch or two submerged in the pool by the lounges. Perfect setup! We had dinner at Dal Toro one night and went to see Blue Man Group afterward; great date night (there are literally no words to describe Blue Man Group; just something everyone should experience once in their life to feel as indescribable as I do writing this!) The only negatives I have (and they are extremely slight ones that can't really be helped) is the location being in the north-central strip portion of the \"action\"; wish it were located near the Flamingo or NY-NY instead; and the almost $20/night resort fee that you are charged for afterwards. It includes all local and toll-free calls, use of the machines at the Canyon Ranch Spa, and a daily newspaper. Too bad it wasn't alacarte, because the only thing we took advantage of was the newspaper. Again, only slight negatives, but I don't mind giving The Palazzo my seal of approval and would not hesitate to recommend this hotel to anyone. If they offered us a special rate again, we would definitely go; we just could not afford $250-$300/night rack rate plus to stay.

It had a television, although the placement was kind of strange- you couldn't really watch it from the tub. I had paid extra for a Strip view- but the view was only OK- the hotel is set very far back from the Strip, and the angle was such that we faced Treasure Island head-on, and only saw part of the rest of the Strip.

The casino had the latest slots and I liked that it was not overrun with loud packs of partyers- if you are the kind of person who wants to be where the action is, then maybe this is not the best choice for you- but I appreciated that it was quieter than, for example, the Bellagio casino. It was not dead, but it was more of a hum of activity than a roar. Although you did have to go through the casino to get to the guest elevators, the path was very wide, so it was easy and quick to navigate with luggage. The hotel has its own driveway, lobby, and front desk, but is connected to the Venetian. It was no problem to go back and forth between the Venetian and Palazzo. I liked that I did not have to exhchange slot vouchers for cash, but could use the same one in both casinos. There were many restaurants and lots of shopping- it would have been quite possible to stay on the property for the entire vacation. I did not have the time to take advantage of the pools or health club, but look forward to doing so on a future trip. Check-in was easy- we arrived at about 10:30 a.m. after a cross-country flight, and were delighted to be given a room immediately. Check-out would have been easy, but there was a glitch on the bill.

A stretch limo was considered most suitable and I decided to go ahead with this for a bit of fun. However the driver was nowhere to be found and after trying other possible meeting places we called the hotel who asked him to call us. He was waiting outside, not at the agreed spot and with no ID, name plate etc. No idea how we were expected to locate him. Then we found air con was not working and after 15 minutes in the car found ourselves more hot and exhausted than during our whole road trip. Was glad of the instant check in having seen the queues downstairs. Check in efficient. After 45 mins we had to call for our baggage, luggage dept had not received the promised request to send it up. I had also requested a gondola trip which had not been booked. Eventually this was acheived but when we arrived we found it had been booked for two not four. No mention had been made of the fact that there are two Gondola options. Prestige lounge was very busy, service slow. I have stayed in a number of Shangri La and Intercontinentals in the Far East and this Club floor service is not in the same league. We had been told that children were not allowed in the bar area which was perfectly understandable but it was pretty annoying to find that the food was also laid out in the bar area so we had to get up any time one of our teenagers wanted a few peanuts. Hot dish had no non-nut or non meat options, these could only be provided at the end of the service and no indication could be given of the next days food content so we could not make plans. Most of the appetisers had run out by 6.15 and were 'finished' even though the savory part of service was meant to continue until 7pm Breakfast was also served in the bar area, no alcohol was evident but presumably the legal requirement remains as we were quite abruptly told to leave and when I pointed out that I could not find seating elsewhere I was just told to 'go and look' no effort to help,find a table, pull a few chairs together etc. Again getting up and down to help two teenagers complete breakfast certainly provided some exercise.

Cabanas are expensive but it is very pretty inside.

After a long haul flight with a tight connection, to experiencing Southwest Airlines in LAX at 8:30am on a Saturday morning, to missing our first flight to LV because of their never ending lines, to getting bumped to the next flight and thankfully getting that one, we were just relieved to arrive at the Palazzo on the Saturday morning. (However our taxi ride was $26! - definitely the scenic route) I had booked one night through Hotwire as it was a Saturday and all the resorts were charging premium rates. We were booked into the Aria from the Sunday for 4 nights but the Sat night was $440 so I gave Hotwire a shot. I had narrowed down the search to 2 possible properties - Venetian or Palazzo and was actually hoping for the V due to the reviews here. We got Palazzo for $165 and I paid the extra $30 to guarantee a double room. We were at check-in at 11:30am with a small wait. The check-in guy was very friendly and was telling us that he was off to Australia in a few days. The Hotwire double room request was NOT sent over (booked through as a single King room) so as I started to scramble around for my paperwork, he said not to worry and it would be a complimentary upgrade (that I had paid for). He also asked if we would like a strip view (?!) which we of course said yes. He said we could have a room immediately if we didn't want a view or to come back at 1:00 for the room with the view. We decided to come back. We came back at 1 and our room still wasn't ready but they offered one on a higher floor. Our phone was ringing when we got into our room and it was the luggage wanting to come up. The rooms were beautiful - we didn't use the lounge area but it felt nice and spacious to have. The beds were beautful and so comfortable! My favourite bed of our US trip. The pools were great - wish we spent more time here. My favourite restaurant of the trip is in here too - Grand Luxe which we had breakfast, lunch and dinner in. All meals were great, especially the weekend buffet breakfast. We also spent 4 nights at Aria and I think I like the Palazzo side of the strip better. Loved having Wynn next door (we went to XS) and the mall is fantastic across the street.

We were a group of 4 celebrating my daughter's 30th birthday. She picked the Palazzo as where she wanted to stay. We really enjoyed the whole facility ..... rooms lovely although we hardly used the living room portion at all..... the beds were WONDERFUL ..... the location is unbeatable since you are about center on the strip., the atmosphere is a little more serene and contemporary than many of the others we walked though during our explorations (exception being the Wynn / Encore which was saw on the last day and which I absolutely LOVED- similarly upscale, contemporary). I do have a little complaint about the Palazzo bathroom...... in a Bella suite with two separate beds one might assume that family groups or mixed groups of friends are staying together -- the shower area is all clear glass open to the whole bath and vanity area so no privacy there. At the Palazzo,we dined in both LAVO (Italian big big portions) and CARNEVINO (steakhouse - melt in your mouth filet and great service). My daughter and niece enjoyed Dos Caminos almost every day at least for happy hour. We lunched twice at the adults only AZURE pool and all food on the pool level is supplied by Wolfgang Puck - wonderful! We did encounter confusion on several occasions with the package we booked. Knowing it was August in Vegas we booked the AZURE (adult pool) package which lists free admission and complimentary chairs, along with a $100 food credit as package benefits. I had asked prior to arrival if we would have admission and chairs EACH day of our stay and asked again at check-in -- both times we went on hold for long periods while supervisors were asked and both times we were told YES. There is confusion though up at the pool since they were telling us to use our \"chair voucher\" one day, and use the food credit another day and we seemed to be getting charged for chairs ...... but it turns out the charge equals a Food/Beverage minimum which varied from $25 on Friday, to $100 on Saturday, to $50 on Sunday. I am still a little confused what we paid for and what we did not up at the pool when all was said and done. It is easy to burn at least $50 if you order food and the specialty drinks are $17 each. One good thing to know is that they often hand out promoter cards for free (ladies) or reduced (guys) admission to Azure and then you just have to deal with \"booking\" the chair (committing to that minimum ). On Friday a very nice server told us that each Saturday they open an additional BIG pool as part of Azure and that there would be plastic chaises in the water which did not have ANY fee or minimum attached to them. In hot weather it is where you want to sit anyhow. It does beg the question where will you put your stuff to stay dry and safe -- best bet is to book at least one $100 chair on a Saturday and you will eat/drink that much easy if you are a twosome or more. We had 4 people and booked two chaises and grabbed several in the water to stay cool (arrive early). Two other trip highlights were dinner at TAO in the Venetian where our savvy server put together a tasting menu for our group - checking with us first to ask what kind of things we might want to avoid. That was wonderful and made it easy and we went into TAO club afterwards. One of my favorites of our stay was walking each morning from the Palazzo into the connected Venetian for \"coffee in Venice\" each day. I have been to Venice at least 7 - 8 times and thought the decor, squares, canal, bridges were very well done --- the gondoliers would usually walk by at 9:45 am (when I likely was there for coffee) singing as they reported for work.

We stayed at The Palazzo Resort Hotel Casino on business for the events ticket meetings and Ticket Summit show as part of EventAdviser.com. Cleanliness: We stayed on the Prestige Level which requires taking private elevators to the 23rd floor and stayed in one of their Luxury Suites (as they call it). I am not sure if the rooms are any different on the lower floors but the room we had was like walking into a very nice 720 sq/ft studio apartment. During our stay the room was cleaned daily and we were provided fresh linens and replacement soaps in a consistent and timely manner. The hallways and lobby also appeared well kept. Location: We were there mostly for meetings for EventAdviser.com but the Resort offered hot tickets, VIP tickets and show tickets for entertainment events within the resort which included David Spade, Joan Rivers, A Bronx Tale, Blue Man Group, Phantom and Jersey Boys during our stay. The Palazzo Resort Hotel Casino is nearby The Wynn and The Encore which also have many concerts, theater, Las Vegas and Broadway tickets and shows. Rooms: The room we stayed was pretty amazing including a very comfortable kind-sized pillow-top bed, three flat-screen LCD HDTVs located throughout, a sitting area with an L-Shaped sofa, fully-stocked refreshment center and dining area. The bathroom was equally impressive with a large tub and glass shower. Service: The service on the Prestige Level was excellent. Some of the complimentary amenities included a private champagne check-in, daily cocktail reception that started at 5 p.m., admission to the Canyon Ranch SpaClub fitness center and pool, etc. During our stay The Palazzo Resort Hotel Casino event offered cheap theatre tickets and cheap event tickets to Phantom and Blue Man Group. Value: We stayed from 7/14 thru 7/18 while on business for EventAdviser.com. The room rate was ($139.00 + (an additional $100.00)) or $239.00/per night to upgrade to the Prestige Level which is well worth it since everything is a la carte for non-Prestige Level guests and would probably cost more (not bundled). Also, if you get tired of gambling its nice to get offers for discount theater tickets and show tickets, from the concierge, which I am not sure non-Prestige Level guests are offered.

My wife really liked the in house shopping mall and we used many of the hotels facilities such as gym, pools and various bars/restaurants. Security was very evident (a good thing) and not having a 'hotel theme' means that you don't seem to get the huge waves of people passing through as you'd find at say Bellagio. A good tip if hiring a car would be to reserve with the inhouse AVIS desk. Find the hotels AVIS promo code on hotel website. We found the rate to be heavily discounted ($200-300 less than other options) plus car is delivered directly to hotel entrance...all very easy. The only slightly negative comment we could make is that the hotel has little of the Vegas aura you find at say Caesars which you may want to consider if its your first trip, but its really hard to find fault with this hotel.", "Date": "August 6, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "San Antonio, Texas", "Title": "\u201cGreat hotel....LOUSY customer relations\u201d", "Author": "traveler6251", "ReviewID": "UR73934217", "Content": "This is a beautiful hotel with gorgeous, luxurious rooms.

I must say, was expecting a whole lot more. The room was spacious and the decor was nice, but it still didn't have a luxury feel to it. I guess this is expectation management, we were expecting more and got less overall. The Palazzo being a fairly new hotel, we were expecting our room to be immaculate, but it wasn't. Dust everywhere, cup marks on the coffee table and desk, stains on the couch, and a chip out of the coffee table. I swear this place seemed ten years old already. Remote control curtains didn't work, had to nudge them everytime to get them to move. The safe battery was low, wasn't sure if we were going to our money out after we locked it. These are details that should have really been taken care of before guests ever stay in a five star rated hotel room. Another issue, and perhaps the most disturbing is the one star toilet paper. Ok, I can put up with the other short comings of this place, but please don't skimp on the toilet paper. The reality is that I've used better toilet paper at truck stops than what was available here. I know a hotel needs to manage its bottom line, but using the absolute cheapest, thinest, sandpaper they can find for their guests who expect five star quality leaves one wondering who's decision this is. Having said that, if you stay here, pack your own toilet paper. Even if you buy the cheapest stuff you can find, it will be better than the newsprint they use here. On the good side, the Palazzo is overall a very nice hotel. The casino is large and has a style of its own. We spent a lot of time and money in the casino as the drinks kept coming and even a few unexpected wins. While we did browse the shops, we didn't buy anything, we usually do our shopping at home. We did eat at a few of the resaurants, which we enjoyed very much. We also visited the pools section, which was very relaxing.

We watched the world cup from all 3 televisions including the one over the tub. Housekeeping was very helpful and friendly. We changed from the mountain view to the strip view, but really the strip view is just so so, not like Bellagio's strip view! but the best part of the strip view was I could see directly over the pool and could see when they were the least crowded. I loved the spacious suite however, I noticed much wasted space in some areas and in other areas where it could have been bigger. Huge wonderful shower, vast, but no bench to sit on while the jets did their work. As big as the bathroom in the master suite was, why not have the tub be a real two person jetted tub? Guests are certainly willing to pay for it, why not have it, there is certainly enough room. The suite is about 1200 square feet and very nice. there is a second half bathroom near the front door. and there is an exercise machine in the suite! the sofa was big and curved or L shaped, very comfortable, plenty of drawers for clothes, and a vanity area with a mirror and a second magnifying mirror for make up, the curtains work via a remote control., awesome. One thing about housekeeping, I thought the shiny speckles were part of the decor, but it was dust. Several times like this, so I just dusted myself with a towel. There is no buffet in the hotel, so we ate at the Grande Lux which is part of the cheesecake factory, and I would eat there over and over, Oh yest the grande lux had a breakfast buffet, however, ordering off the menu might be better. All the meat products were pork, no chicken or turkey sausage, no smoked salmon, but the omelet station was fine. But ordering off the menu was divine. I get sick of really fancy restaurants sometimes. Overpriced, small portions, I liked the Grande lux, casual but very fresh. and if you can't finish through it away or take it back to your room. We ate at an Italian\\/ Mediterranean restaurant one night when we crossed over to the Venetian, called Zafarreno or something like that. It was stuffy and didn't care for the food at all. Preferred the Grande Lux or room service. Room service was great. They are polite and come when they say they will. Yes I would stay there again. There was nothing even in my picking or light criticism that would prevent me from staying here again. I went down to the spa and paid a small fee to use the showers, the relaxation room and the saunas and hot tubs, it was very nice, they had a room called......quiet room or the wave room. when you go in it is dimly lit and quiet with reclining chairs circularly situated and titled back so you could see the ceiling which was reflections and sounds of ocean waves. at first I thought it was dumb, but if you lie back and relax and stare at the ceiling, it was quite enjoyable and relaxing, I fell asleep and kept waking up snoring, (embarrassing, but I wanted to stay) At one point I woke up and everyone else was gone, so I decided to go too, before I ruined any one else's experience with my music. Palazzo/Venetian has Jersey Boys and Phantom of the Opera, and something else that I can't remember, but I got tickets to \"O\" and saw this at the Bellagio. I bought seven copies of the sound track. I heard the Jersey Boys were good, and if you are attending a conference and wear your badge, Phantom of the Opera gave 50% off the tickets even in the golden circle section where the chandelier drops.

The casino is extremely easy to navigate through, and while you still have to go through it to get to the elevators, its simply, quick and easy.

The rooms are large, spacious, and extremely clean and well taken care of. The remote control curtains were nice as well as an actual thermostat in the room. However, it seemed to struggle to keep up, or turned off randomly in the night. The only downside was the service flip-flopped from amazing to questionable. Our upgrade was nice, however, the lost luggage following our move to another room was not. Turns out they put someone in our room, before they sent an employee to get our bags. When we called and asked, they went to the room we were supposed to be moved to and found it was also occupied by somebody else!

We were generally impressed with the cleanliness and lack of smoke in the casino and hotel. In order to better organize my thoughts I have tried breaking down out experience into sections; Check-in: The line went fairly quick and we were greeted by a front desk person that did not really seem to enjoy what they did. I had considered asking for a complimentary upgrade ($20 trick) but was not getting a great vibe so did not bother. We had asked for a King bed, non-smoking in a quiet location. We received everything and were happy that they put us at the end of one of the halls. The instructions to find our room from the lobby were easy. Casino We did not gamble this trip (we generally do not gamble). We were however very impressed with the high ceilings and ventilation system. We are non-smokers and this casino felt almost smoke free. The casino itself is spacious and you never felt crowded walking through it. Lux Cafe: We ordered food from our room and picked it up from the Grand Lux Cafe. This was extremely convenient and very fairly priced. We also ate dinner at this restaurant but this is not covered in this review. Room: The room is very large and nicely laid out. The beds were comfortable. We found the rooms to be clean. Would have liked to be able to remove the contents from the fridge to put our water, etc in but the goodies are on censors. Once removed they are billed to your room. When the doors shut, they are extremely loud. I tried to ease our shut but they still slammed (sorry neighbors). It helped being at the end of the hallway as the foot traffic was minimized and we found it quite quiet (except the doors). We stayed on the 39th floor. Continental Breakfast We received eight certificates for free breakfasts. The breakfast area is located on the 2nd floor by the Palazzo shops. This breakfast is much but if you want something quick then it may be enough. They served coffee, juice, pastries and fruit (orange, banana and apple). Otherwise don't bother. It was never very busy. I did find out that there is free internet in this area of the Palazzo 'mall' so that was nice to be able to have a coffee and check emails etc. Pool Sun came around the buildings around 11:45 to 12:00. Never had troubles finding chairs. We sat at a smaller pool area with half the loungers reserved for cabanas. This worked well as the pool was never crowded. I wish there was a smoking and non-smoking section. I used to be a smoker and don't enjoy being around it at all. Some smokers are considerate, while other not so much. We had a bite to eat at the pool. We had to go and order the food ourselves, pool side service was non-existent. I really expected more. I don't mind paying more for food by the pool. But the food quality was much like you would get at a cheap diner. Would not eat there again on our stay. Concierge: Extremely helpful and friendly! Bellman: We wanted to catch the Palazzo shuttle to the airport. We explained to the bellman(s) there was a supervisor and bellman there that we needed to get the airport to catch our plane. The shuttle comes every hour on the hour and we were told that we did not miss it. 20 mins later we inquired again. We were then told the next shuttle comes in another 40 mins!

The bathroom was huge, even though the tub faces the opposite direction of the television, so you would not be able to bathe and watch television if that's your thing. The shower was nice, with very good pressure. We did not pay the resort fee with our offer, so we didn't use the spa or heath club. We also didn't go to the pools so we cannot comment on that, although there are several to choose from and we could have used the Venetian's as well. We did eat lunch at Lagasse's Stadium and it was just O.K.. I wouldn't go back there for the food, although it's a nice sports bar. We were given a pass for four to the night club at the Palazzo ($120 value). The pass was attached to the room info. given to us at check-in, so when we gave it to our waitress so she knew which room to charge our lunch to at Lagasse's, she kept it, so we were not able to go there. We played a bit in the casino, but didn't have much luck. The parking lot is all underground and is a nightmare. There are sensors on each floor to indicate the number of spots available on each level which is kind of nice, but we had a very hard time finding a parking place and be prepared to walk a lot. Overall, this property is very nice, but it's just not for us. We prefer a smaller, more intimate property with less pretentious patrons.

However when we opened the window shades, the entire window was blocked by an enormous 12ft tall air conditioner. It was impossible to see anything out the window except for a small patch of blue sky if you looked straight up. Poor layout to stick a customer with that crappy of a window view. No need for window shades with that huge a/c in the way. Make sure you don't get stuck with a \"no view\" room like we did on the 5th floor. Our room also did not have any \"do not disturb\" or \"maid service\" tags for the door. Of course I didn't notice until I was about to go to bed, so I wasn't about to call the front desk and have to wait up in bed just to get them delivered. When we left the room to get lunch the next morning, we returned late at night to find that our room had not been made up! My wife or I did not hear anyone knocking on our door in the morning for maid service, and I also saw housekeeping down the hall when we walked out of the room for lunch. I guess they didn't think it was necessary to clean our room. Make sure to request maid service, otherwise you'll have to re-use all the towels that were left on the floor the day before. Our last night we were up extremely late in the Palazzo casino gambling at the tables. By the time I went to bed late, I called the front desk to see if I could get a late checkout of 12noon instead of the normal 11am checkout, but they refused my request. That is the first time I've ever been denied a late checkout when I had been gambling late at the hotel's casino. To top it all off, I had to valet my car the night before because their parking lot was too full to even find a spot in self park. I picked up my Audi from the valet service and stopped to get gas. As soon as I walked over to the passenger side I noticed a huge scratch on the passenger side front wheel where it appears the valet drove right into a curb.

I did not like the shower because the water pressure was low and the water temperature wasn't hot enough. I realize that this is a LEED-certified building and all, but I love my scalding hot water and strong water pressure. Another issue in bathroom is that it is hard to view the television from the tub.

Canaletto was excellent-large portions, fresh seafood, intricate flavors, decent prices-fantastic.

The room was really beautiful, but the service at the hotel wasn't great. We waited in line for 40 minutes to check into our room, and this was after midnight! There were originally three people checking in guests, but even with the line for check-in very long, one left a few minutes after we arrived. Then when we finally made it to the front of the line, they would not honor the rate that we had been promised based on our comp offer. We were told to check with the guest service center, which we did. When we checked with the guest service center, we were told that we would have to call the reservation line the next day and ask to speak to a supervisor, which we did. When we called the reservation line and asked to speak to a supervisor, we were put on hold for 20 minutes while the supervisor listened to the recording of our original call to make our reservation, THEN they adjusted our rate to the one that we were originally quoted. Not fun. Also, we missed out on a free massage because guest services did not give us any information about the bonus being offered for first time players at the resort. We were only informed of the available bonuses when we cashed out our points as we left, which was too late for us to take advantage of a pretty cool offer. If it is your first time to play at the Palazzo, ask for details about the tiered bonuses for new players. The food at the Grand Lux and at the Mexican restaurant were really good, we enjoyed both and would definitely eat at both again.

I have to add this though giving the beauty of the hotel and the ambience of it all it is a walk to the Bellagio, MGM and all those other big name hotels we all know Vegas for BUT, I would not have changed my reservation for anything in the world because this hotel made up for the walk double time. I enjoyed the indoor Gondola ride which was amazing, the host were on point and friendly and the \"Driver\" of the Gondola was really nice he sang to us while to drifted off to the \"Little\" world of Venice, The Venetian did a wonderful job with their hotels, the details were just immaculate. I could go on and on about the Palazzo/Venetian but it would take five pages and more to give all details. I just tell my fellow Trip Advisor readers THAT THE Palazzo/Venetian is the place to stay, it might not be cut out for everyone as some may think it is to Upscale for their taste but hey why not try it I LOVED IT..

The conference was in the Venetian/Palazzo meeting rooms and our lodging was at the Palazzo. I was very impressed with the rooms, comfort, luxury, and cleanliness. Due to the constant stream of alcohol and tobacco smoke in Las Vegas, many of the casinos (and subsequently the hotels) just look and feel dingy. However, the Palazzo has smoke-free corridors throughout the casino and the nonsmoking guest rooms are indeed sans smoke. Don't get me wrong, if I had it my way, the entire facility would be smoke free, but perhaps one day casinos will be seen as workplaces and thus be smoke-free. The guest bathrooms are gorgeous in the suites. The toilet chamber echos a bit, so I hope if you're with other people, you are comfortable with each others bodily bathroom noises. The beds are excellent - I rarely sleep well in hotels, but each night I was knocked out and woke refreshed. I wouldn't mind bringing home both the bed and the bathroom... There are three TVs in the suites - one in the bathroom, near the bed, and near the sofa. That's a bit excessive -- you can never watch all three at once. We were on the 41st floor with a view of the Wynn and Encore hotels - a great few. If you can manage an upper floor, I highly recommend it. We had high speed internet in our guest suites as part of the conference package. However, the general guest would have to pay for access per day. A suggestion I wish we had found sooner -- Dueling Pianos in the Salute Lounge just inside the casino -- what a blast! We found that two nights before we left and apparently they play nightly between 5:30 PM and 1:30 AM. It's an all-request show with two singers/piano players. They can do anything from Snoop Dogg to Jay Z to Alicia Keys to The Who to Journey to show tunes. I really wish I had known about this sooner, I would have been there every night. The blond musician, Phyllis, is my favorite! Lastly, and most importantly, the pools! It's easy to get fooled into thinking the first pool you see when walking out of the Solaro restaurant area is awesome, but don't stop there. Keep walking over toward the Venetian -- those pools are actually better with fewer people (i.e. kids). When you get to the Venetian side, you'll happen upon the poolside bar, the pool to your left was our secret. There were a handful of people there throughout the afternoon, but by the time 5:00 rolled around, we were consistently two of only about 6 people in the water. We took goggles and had a blast playing. The pool depth is 3.5-4 feet so it's nice and warm and shallow.

If you have or say you have medicine that needs refrigerated you can get a free refrigerator in the room where you can keep your water. You will need alot of water as it is hot this time of year. There were some nicks in the furniture and a stain or two on the sofa. Other than that the maids kept the room clean and the beds were extremely comfortable. One thing in the bathroom the door to the toilet area is heavy and won't stay open. It slams shut leaving you in a dark (bad lighting) unventilated room. Our view was good overlooking the pool and the strip. We had no major issues with service except you have to wait on hold for the front desk and also for the conceirge. The maid service was good and so was the bellstaff. Also the service at the restaurants were good. Casino - the Grazie players card's use is confusing. We were constantly standing in line waiting to find out what we were entitled too. We are now home and still don't know if we got what were entitled to. The slots were tight compared to the slots in Atlantic City which is near where we live. The Casino is well ventilated and not too smoky as at other hotels. The pools are nice but crowded. They are shallow and you have to go to the Venetian if you want to swim. There are alot of kids at the pool and no designated adult pool. We had breakfast at the Grand Lux which had a good breakfast buffet at a reasonable price. We also had good breakfasts at Del Toro and Solaro by the pool. We had dinner at Carnevino and liked it. The food was good but expensive. One thing that happened is I fell in the hotel and needed ice.I asked the hostess at the restaurant for ice and she said she was bringing it but never did. My leg swelled. She seemed to care less and I finally got the ice from my waitress. The hotel surroundings are very nice. The shops are nice but expensive. Between the Venetian and the Palazzo it is a big hotel. Jersey Boys - Don't miss it. This was one great show.

We spend the week exploring the properties up and down the strip and never once regretted the choice. The Palazzo is far from the \"family infested\" southern end of the Strip. City Center is simply too dull and sterile for Vegas. While the Bellagio and the Wynn were unmatched in beauty and elegance, they seemed to be missing the fun. The Palazzo/Venetian complex had the perfect combination of elegance and classic over-the-top Vegas kitsch. The rooms (luxury suites) are just as described on the website. There cannot have been a bad view in the place. Our suite overlooked the Wynn golf course. You'd have to be pretty fussy to be dissappointed in any of these accomodations. The Palazzo itself is extremely easy to navigate (as opposed to the Venetian) if a little bit of a walk to get anywhere. The amount of restaurants and shops a short elevator ride away is staggering. The casino was much less disorienting than others on the strip. I found the perfumed smell throughout the Venetian/Palazzo property quite pleasant and welcoming. The pool complex is spectacular. No wave pools, water slides, or lazy rivers...just perfect for those of us who want to lounge in chairs, swim laps, or soak in the spas without screaming kids around. We had no problems with the service at this hotel. All employee interactions (which were rare because everything on this trip went smoothly) were friendly and professional. The front desk let us check in at around 11am, which we really appreciated. The concierge helped us score some badly needed tickets before some shows sold out. The valets were prompt and housekeeping was more than competent. The staff didn't go out of their way to make us feel special, but they did the job. I strongly reccomend the Palazzo for your Vegas vacation. Tips: - A room facing away from the Strip will be much quieter than if you upgraded to the Strip view. - If you can drag yourself out of bed when the pool opens at 8am, it's worth it. The summer weather is beautiful and you'll have the place all to yourself. -Grand Lux Cafe and the food court in the Venetian are some of the most affordable places to get a decent meal on the Strip. -Walgreens is located on the Strip in between the Venetian and Palazzo...stock up here.", "Date": "June 19, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Elmhurst, Illinois", "Title": "\u201cIncredible!!!\u201d", "Author": "dolphinron", "ReviewID": "UR67860418", "Content": "This will be a short review but unbelievable period.

He lost $1500 in an hour so they should have loved him. The refridgerator comes stocked and on sensors so you can't remove so much as a water without being charged $6, and theres no room in it to put any of your own things such as left overs. The in suite movies that aren't at the theater anymore are $15 or you can watch an archived 22 min episode of the office for $5. The internet access is $12 per day. I have an air card but it was still annoying considering motel 6 gives it to you for free and they're probably classified as 1 or 2 stars. The M&Ms are $9. No mint on your pillow. I would say this is a 3 star hotel. If you want a jetted tub you have to get the siena suite. Overall just not 5 stars in any way. Of course there are restaurants and pools and so forth but that goes without saying. The air quality in the casino is so bad I got a nose bleed and my heart raced the whole time. I expect better air filtration. Just for you single men out there there aren't any pretty women working here either so I'd head somewhere else for that. I confirmed that with my husband, not just my opinion. I will be trying the Vdara next time, which is smoke free and connected to the bellagio.", "Date": "June 18, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "ontario", "Title": "\u201cAbsolutely Fantastic\u201d", "Author": "tyfail", "ReviewID": "UR67812571", "Content": "My wife and I have just returned from a 4 day break in Las Vegas, where we stayed at the Palazzo and let me tell everyone who reads this, that is an amazing place.

We ate in the Lavo restaurant, outside overlooking the strip and our waiter was \" Tony \" and he was brilliant. The food was very, very good and the dining experience was wondedrful. We also ate in the Grand Lux Cafe which also has great food, a wee bit cheaper than the Lavo but equally as good. Everything about this hotel was top notch. Go there,,, stay there,,, Oh I forgot to mention that my wife absolutely loved the chocolate martinis in the Laguna Champagne Bar. We went to 2 shows, Anthony Cools the hynotist who was very entertaining but somewhat crude, okay I guess but not fantastic. The second show we saw was Terry Fator at the Mirage, now let me tell everyone, this guy is nothing short of amazing, an absolute special talent who entertains from the DJ at the start of the eveniongs entertainment right through the show. This was the best show that my wife and I have ever seen in Vegas. Honestly and truly,,, FANTASTIC.... Go see him and you will be amazed as much as we were.

Check in on Tuesday at noon was smooth and the the room was ready when I arrived. They offered upgrades to a 1300 SF suite for $100 per night. A good value but I declined as the rooms are already much larger than most. The room was nearly 800 square feet with king size bed, large L shaped couch, 2 flat screen tv's, desk, sitting area/3 chairs small dresser, bath with seperate tub/shower, 2 sinks and seperate vanity with seat. The view in 45-729 was overlooking the Venetian pools and the Wynn golf course - spectacular. The bed was also one of the more comfortable I have ever experienced. This more or less ends any positive comments I can offer. The service experienced for the duration of the stay was far below the standards of any hotel, let alone one in this class and price range. There was a \"package\" department in the conference center that I was directed to for pickup of my materials. There was one person working the counter and two others milling about with little interest in the line out front. I overheard another employee on a radio asking for assistance at the counter twice but help never arrived. After a 35 minute wait, they could not tell me what room the materials needed to be delivered to and to come back once I figured it out. This is one of the largest conference facitlites in Vegas so I do not understand how one person is expected to facilitate any type of volume. After two hours of walking around and coming back to the counter for another 10 minute wait, my items were delivered to the conference booth. Upon leaving, we were told to fill out our paperwork for return shipping and leave in the exhibit hall. Our material was no where to be found for three days after we left and three calls went unreturned. Our packages finally shipped on day 4 with no explanation. Dinner at Dos Caminos night one. Food came out cold and was average at best. Our waiter disappeared every few minutes and we started to get drink refills from anyone that would stop. Our table was never cleared and we had to ask twice for our bill. Lunch at Lux cafe day two. Sat for 10 minutes without being acknolwedged and then had to ask for our drinks twice before they finally came out. Seared ahi appetizer was entirely inedible. It came out a room temperature gray color and was rubbery. Not sure how that made it out of the kitchen. Pizza and sandwhiches took 35 minutes. Server again was nowhere in site and we had to ask another server to track down our check. Table was still not cleared when we left. Dinner day 3 at Delmonicos. My drink was served with lipstick on the glass. Appetizers were ordered and never came. The server had no idea until our entrees arrived and I pointed that out. From the time soup and salad left the table, entrees took 25 minutes to arrive. The 9 ounce filet was 6 ounces on a good day - one of the smallest I have ever seen. They offered dessert and coffee as a gesture for the appetizers. The capuccino was muddy and cold and the pecan torte was as dry as once could imagine. Not at all the experience you would expect from fine dining at these prices. Dinner day 4 - went to Lagasses sport bar at 940 pm. A server told us to have a seat and she would send the hostess over with menus. When she arrived, we were scolded for sitting without her knowledge and informed that the kitchen was closing in 10 minutes. Aren't we in Vegas? Had a fabulous meal and service at The First Bar in the attached Palazzo mall. Pool service on weekdays and weekends was non existent. Two out of 5 days my room was not serviced as of 6 p.m. and one of those days took 2 phone calls to actually get clean towels. My reservation was split into three night and two nights. I let them know at check in and they assured me my keys would work and it would be seemless. After three nights, the keys were deactivated and they checked me out. When I went downstairs they said the other reservation was never linked. So much for the easy check in. Upon checkout I was asked about my stay and told the clerk I was disappointed and would not be back. When asked for specifics I referenced the key issue and the room not being cleaned. She said she sees that I had a problem with my keys but no record of my housekeeping issues and threw in some attitude as if I were making it up. Just would I would expect after my other experiences. I'm likely leaving some things out because it was a comedy of errors and poor service for 5 straight days. I am an easy to please traveler with expectations that suit the brand and the price I am paying. Having stayed in at least 12 or more hotels in Vegas, I put this place at or near the bottom. Friday on was spent at other hotels and restuarants and we had a fabulous time with good food and service throughout. Unless you are here for free, I would pass.

First when we arrived we had two double beds and asked to upgrade to a king. There was an up charge to do this so we stayed with our room. This was a bit of a surprise but worked out well. Rooms: We had a large suite which was great although the bedroom is still part of the suite. Depending what you like this may be a pro or a con. We found this to be a con and would prefer a separate bedroom however this was another 150.00 per night. I feel this is not really a suite but a very large room. Otherwise the rooms are well appointed and it was clean. Great modern d\u00e9cor. No concerns here. Check in: Friendly and helpful. Our initial reservation was mixed up and a few calls later it was fixed. No concerns. Breakfast: Our package came with a free breakfast. Not only was it in the mall it was very poor. For a resort of this quality pastry and whole fruit is not acceptable. Just offer some yogurt or eggs and I think you would have less complaints. We never used this after checking it out the first day and I felt this was the idea. Step this up Pallazzo and do not pay for this as it is very poor. Gaming: Great time, great service. Drinks were efficient particularly on the tables. Players club. We signed up and it was confusing. Online it said we had no comps however I phoned daily and was comped at minimum 100.00 per day. This is a problem as some comps were directly at the restaurant and not there when we got our bill so took some time to figure out. (they did show up but it took time) Also on check out they were not there so took over \u00bd hour to figure this out. Not sure if this is a con but we ended up with more comps than on the phone. They should figure this out though as it is frustrating. Make sure you call as you never know what they may comp you. The casino is also small enough to find everone you are with. I like this as we always get separated. Spa and gym: Great gym. The spa was more like a gym club and not very spa like. My massage was mediocre at best. Be aware (thxs other trip advisors) if you go to the desk the day of you can get a massage for 100.00 if they have availability. You have to ask and re ask to get this but its there if they are not too busy. They will not do this by phone. Also mixed messages. I was told I could not charge to my room by one person and another said it was fine. Pool: Crowded but typical for Vegas. We rented a cabana one day on the Venetian side and by noon the Beach was booming music and there was no relaxing. We asked to be comped a cabana the next day as it was awful (there were no good ones to move to) and he said no. He did offer our money back which was great. It would have been a better deal for the hotel to keep our 400.00 and give us a cabana on the Monday when they were not even full but. The palazzo side is quiet and next time I will get a cabana there. Service was fine, drinks expensive but good. Food average, the restaurant was fine, not great. Restaurants: Lavo, first night amazing food and service. Several days latter amazing food and the worst service. Great atmosphere, portions are massive so think about sharing. Samba sushi: expensive but great food. Try the tacos, their version of. Lux Caf\u00e9: Basic fare but good. Massive portions, share. Location: great for shopping and walking elsewhere. Overall we loved this resort and would go back. I may try the Wynn next time but I really like this one.

I can not say enough about the friendly service.

I am in the hotel business and was impressed. They need to train other hotel staffs in customer service. The rooms are fantastic. We stayed in the luxury suite which I think is the smallest, and \"small\" in this case is a misleading term. This suite was phenomenal. Our room had the bathroom to the left when we walked in. Very large open space with glassed in shower, soaking tub, separate water closet, marble counters, flat screen tv and dual sinks. Very spacious. Further down the corridor and you are in the bedroom which is beautifully appointed with mini canopy over the bed. Dresser with flat screen tv mounted on the wall. There is a master switch for the lights when you enter so you can set that to turn off and on whatever lights throughout the room you prefer. Step down into the living area and you have another large space with a table and 4 chairs, L shaped sofa, desk and chair and another piece of furniture with the large safe and mini bar in it. And yet another flat screen tv. Nice touches like remote controlled roman shade and blinds on the window, drawers that close automatically without being pushed all the way in, and the robes in the room are all nice pampering touches to have when you're on vacation. We stayed on the side of the hotel facing Treasure Island and the pool, so we could look directly at it. Word of caution: There was a lot of loud music at the pool during the day, so if you plan on being there during the day to take a nap in between morning and going out in the evening you may want to request to be away from the pool. And we went Memorial Day Weekend so it could have been special that weekend. I would definitely request the same location. The hotel is very convenient. It is right next door to Wynn, Encore and Treasure Island and Fashion Show Mall and Harrah's is a short walk. It is connected by walkway to the Venetian. Tons of dining and shopping options are under one roof. There is a Walgreens' drug store at the front of the hotel which is very convenient. I would choose this location again and look forward to my next stay at this hotel.

My first good experience occurred when I had originally booked one of our suites for only 2 nights, but then needed to extend to 3 nights after my promotion had expired. They were able to honor my original rate with no argument. Nice! I was a little miffed that the Venetian and Palazzo properties charge more per night for two queen beds vs. kings, and for an extra $10/nt I can guarantee connecting rooms. I decided to take my chances with the $20 trick at check in. Since I had 2 king suites booked, I folded 2 $20 bills between my license and cc and gave it to my check in clerk, a mid-20's, pretty, hispanic girl. I stated I had \"a few room requests I hope you can help me out with. I would love a couple of Bella suites, and connecting rooms are a must.\" She quickly replied \"no problem,\" and it was absolutely perfect! She gave us connecting queen rooms with a view on the 36th floor. Awesome! It was so nice to have the living area and double bathroom vanities with seven women in two suites. We checked in around 11am, rooms were ready just after noon. Bell services had our bags delivered within 10 minutes of calling down. The pool area was shaded in parts before about 11am, but there were lots of chairs and a variety of places to sit. We rented a cabana on the first day and it was a great way to relax after traveling! We dined at Dos Caminos and Grand Lux Cafe. Both had very good food for prices that you would expect in Vegas, around $15-$20 per person. Not bad. I expected the casino to be tight and snooty, but instead it was comfortable with an upscale feel. Overall our experience was perfect at the Palazzo, definitely equal to that at Bellagio.

I was a little concerned about staying here as there were mixed reviews and I found a better rate at both the Four Seasons and Mandarin Oriental. But in the end, we decided on the Palazzo due to its location and room size; we were not disappointed. The rooms are very nice, very big. There is plenty of room to spread out and relax. The bathrooms are nice, but I would agree with other reviewers that THE hotel\u2019s bathrooms are more luxurious feeling. The beds are comfortable \u2013 I had no issues with the sheets or pillows, perhaps they could\u2019ve been a little softer, but that is just personal preference. We had the continental breakfast on the concierge level included in our room rate and that proved to save us quite a bit. We had breakfast there every morning \u2013 plenty to fill us up and a great way to start every day, very relaxing with a great view. As far as the rest of the hotel\u2026..the pool is OK, nothing special, but still very nice. The casino is large, classy, not loud at all. It is so nice to be able to walk through the large walkway from the elevators to the lobby through the casino without feeling overwhelmed by noise and smoke (no smoke smell at all). And I never smelled the \u201cstrong\u201d perfume others have complained about being piped into the Palazzo and Venetian. We really enjoyed Dos Caminos; their chips, guac and margaritas are delicious! And Caf\u00e9 Lux is a great staple restaurant and also really quite reasonably priced for what you get. Be forewarned: the portions are HUGE! You can honestly order one entr\u00e9e and share (that includes their salads). The only bad meal in the hotel we had was at Morels. I won\u2019t go into the details here, but honestly, the service was absolutely pathetic. My husband does not get mad easily (at all) and he was fuming by the time we got the $400 bill. Their lack of service made us late for our show (The Beatles, LOVE \u2013 awesome!). We cannot recommend Morels. We did the Rasul Ceremony and couples massage at the Canyon Ranch Spa after spending the morning using the Aquavana . I would just say the spa is good, not great. The Rasul Ceremony is unique. I am glad we did it, but wouldn\u2019t do it again. My massage was pretty unspectacular. My husband really enjoyed his. Service at the hotel was very good. Everyone that we came across was helpful and friendly. As far as housekeeping was concerned, I had read on TA that the housekeeping was bad so everyday I left a $5 tip with a note listing any items we needed (extra towels, glasses, etc.). Our room was always clean and we always had extra towels and toiletries in the room when we returned. I had NO complaints regarding housekeeping! Sometimes I think people don't realize that tipping housekeepers does help with the service you receive. All in all, the Palazzo is a really nice hotel in a great location.

After much deliberation we decided to stay at the Palazzo. There is only one word to describe this hotel and that is pure luxury!!! Rooms The rooms are absolutely amazing. Sorry I mean suites! Simply stunning. The views from our room were out of this world, that is once you had pulled the blinds with your remote control!!!! The bathroom was the biggest I have ever seen with LCD screens for when you\u2019re brushing your teeth :-) The rooms are classy but extremely comfortable with a lounge area and huge TV. This has to be one of the best rooms I have ever stayed in. Casino A word of warning, if you intend to spend your evenings on the tables you can forget it here. With most of the tables having a minimum $25 dollar bet, our money was never going to last as long as it did when we stayed at Treasure Island. Drinks at the bar when you are not betting are incredibly expensive too but this is to be expected with the general ambience of the hotel oozing money (and lots of it). A round of drinks for the 4 of us was never under $40 so grab the waitresses when you see them as they didn\u2019t come by all that often (even when you do generously tip). Pool We visited the pool (Solaro) a couple of times and I have to say that it was like something out of a movie. People who wanted to be seen in their swimming outfits prancing around trying to get noticed. However, that didn\u2019t spoil the pool area which was beautiful and once again oozed luxury. Dining Grand Luxe \u2013 We ate here on a number of occasions for breakfast and the food was great. With huge portions as to be expected in the US. Zine Noodles and Dim Sum \u2013 Lovely restaurant. Food was amazing. We had a 7 course taster meal which was really nice! Lavo \u2013 We booked this as a treat and we were not disappointed. Overlooking the strip we sat on the balcony watching the Treasure Island pirate show. An experience all on its own! Sushisamba \u2013 We didn\u2019t eat here but enjoyed a few cocktails before heading out. This is up in the mall area of the hotel and is well worth a visit. I think we had some buy one get one free vouchers given to us at the pool and they came in very handy! Facilities Make sure you register for the Club Grazie club on arrival. They issue you with a credit card type thing that contains a $50 credit. Believe me you will be grateful once your money has run out! As a guest of the Palazzo you can get yourself on the guest list at a number of clubs in its sister hotel the Venetian and we opted for TAO. A must if you intend to party in Vegas. We was however lucky enough to get into the new TAO Beach, a roof top club based around a swimming pool. The strangest partying experience I have ever had but soooooo much fun. I would also highly recommend seeing Jersey Boys while you are there. Based in the Palazzo\u2019s own theatre it is a wonderful show and you get a good rate as a guest. To sum up I suppose the question is would I return to the Palazzo and I probably have to say no. Not because I was disappointed in any way, it is just my opinion that every visit to Vegas should be to somewhere new.

Pros: Customer service is world class. Despite the resort being fully booked with a blue-chip IBM convention, I fell to my knees when I entered my suite and discovered I had been upgraded to a 1,400 square foot Sienna Suite! Words do not do justice, See photos and videos. All interactions with the staff was a world class/five star experience. From housekeeping to valet - all needs were anticipated and exceeded. Opulent and HUGE Suite. Shock and Awe to enter the suite and see a private gym, a guest bath and flawless views of the strip from the 46nd floor. Electric drapes in both the living room and master bedroom - you can spend HOURS enjoying this feature. Great lighting - even though a Green property the lighting was awesome. This is not the case with Trump or The Hotel which I have stayed before. Color Printer - No other resorts offer complimentary state of the art printer/fax machines. This was especially handy in printing critical work and travel documents. Slot-machines - Both abundant and GENEROUS! A reverse ATM. Casino service - I never waited more than two minutes for a drink, Housekeeping - AWESOME! How they arrange your personal items is masterful. And a request (with generous tip) resulted in an abundance of designer soaps. Complimentary gift basket - This was a total surprise. On on my second day I arrived to find an abundance of gourmet and other indulgent treats in the six person dining room table! Not worthy! Dining - Grand Lux at both the Venetian and Palazzo are a welcome and affordable 24 hour respite when you\u2019re hungry after a long night of gaming. The menu is HUGE and everything was delicious. HUGE portions! Security is top-notch. You feel SAFE! You can\u2019t enter the Palazzo suites without your room card shown to the security staff. Bags To Go - This vendor managed service is AMAZING. I was able to check two large bags and receive my boarding pass without having the stress and hassle for only $20. This service is conveniently located in the lobby area. More time for gaming and bags arrived in Dallas without having to lug them through flight check-in. You go straight to the boarding area. The beds are PERFECTION and there are extra pillows and sheets in the closet to choose from. The robes are INCREDIBLE! Previous reviews have commented on the long walks to get to your room. This is not the case if you self park and take advantage of the direct elevator to the Palazzo Suites located under the resort. And if you choose to valet park, the walk through the elegant and well appointed public areas is a real treat. The valet staff is personable and ATTRACTIVE! Priority Guest Services - press the P on the phone and your needs are met in less than five minutes. This was the case with a DVD remote and printer ink refill. Vibe - Electric! No other resort comes close to the excitement, class and sophistication. If you desire high energy this is the place. If you desire a nurturing low key and pampering experience this is the place.

The bed was very comfortable, the power driven window blinds and drapes worked and the room was very clean, except for one glass stain on the table in the living area, which I spotted immediately but which remained throughout our week's stay. We had a good view from our window and suffered no noise or disturbance from the rooms on either side of us, nor from people in the corridors. Our room was made up daily, regardless of the different times that we vacated the room each day. We had a few problems with the room but these were sorted out immediately and with courtesy and apologies. Initially our in-room safe was locked, presumably left like that by the previous guests, so a gentleman came with his computer gadget to read the last code and open it. The hairdryer in the bathroom drawer didn't work, and this was replaced immediately by a working one. And we had rung The Palazzo in advance of our arrival to check if there were tea and coffee making facilities provided in our room, otherwise we would bring our own kettle for that vital 'first cup of tea before you get out of bed' without which my husband can't exist! We were told on the phone that all rooms had hot drink making facilities, only to find upon arrival that none did. I complained to reception and with a little 'persuasion' they arranged for a hot water urn, tray, coffee cups and sugar to be provided free of charge to our room for the duration of our visit. The urn duly arrived though without an electric cord, but this was quickly provided when prompted by me. Fortunately I had brought our own teabags and there was just enough spare room in the hospitality fridge for a small bottle of milk, so all was well with the world! The daily resort fee stuck in our throat a bit as we didn't have time to go to the gym and we don't have a laptop to make use of the in-room online facility. A daily newspaper was also included in the resort fee, but wasn't delivered to your room like I had imagined. Instead you had to traipse to some distant point on the second floor in The Venetian next door to pick it up. We didn't bother as I had understood it to only be local papers that were available. However, once the volcanic ash cloud crisis arose and we needed to see what the papers back home in the UK were saying about revised flight arrangements, we found out that we could get the previous day's British newspaper from the same second floor vendor and this was still covered by the resort fee. So at least we got a tiny bit back on the fee, albeit only 2 British newspapers! The longish journey to the newspaper outlet also enabled me to discover something I wouldn't otherwise have come across. On my way back to our room in the Palazzo with my newspaper, at 9.50am one morning, I found myself behind the line of gondoliers on their way to the part of the indoor Venetian canal bridge from where they start their daily work of punting visitors around in the gondolas. They were marching along in single file, like the Seven Dwarfs, dressed in their smart matching outfits, and singing a lovely Italian song beautifully. They hadn't finished their song by the time they got to the hump back bridge over the canal, so they all lined up over the bridge until they'd finished singing. It was wonderful to watch and well worth trying to catch one morning if you're in the vicinity.

The hotel... itself was beautiful (as is its sister hotel, the Venetian). The \"smoke-free\" corridors really limit the amount of smoke you breathe in and smell like. The constant pumping of fresh scents through the air vents gives the hotel (rooms included) a very crisp, nice scent. Not overbearing at all. Like most other Vegas hotels, everything is continually cleaned/maintained/fixed. The room... gorgeous. I am not sure if its just luck, or a part of the conceirge package, but our room had a beautiful view of the strip and T.I. across the street. The bathroom was clean, had his/her sinks, shower/tub and a seperate vanity. The service... top notch. Now this is where I will argue that it had to do with our conceirge service. Whether it was information from the front desk, dealers, etc., everyone was most pleasant to deal with (regardless of whether it was via phone or in person). In fact, my gf accidentally left money in a slot machine and they called us to make sure we came to the cashier to pick it up. Thats unheard of this day and age! The conceirge package... highly recommend. The continental breakfast every morning hit the spot. While we did not participate in \"afternoon tea,\" but we did make the evening happy hour and apps. Again, service was immpecable. The conceirge service helped us get into clubs/lounges, recommend dining/sightseeing/etc (even places not within our hotel or its management company). Food... hard to say. We didnt order room service, but did dine at two of the hotels numerous restaurants. We had a \"new age\" Mexican dinner that was great. Slightly pricey but the gaucamole was outstanding. I had a pulled pork dish which was great. Our friends had a variety of tacos (fish, chicken etc.). We also dined at Lavo. The food was very, very good. However, the place is a little pricey. We had a great view since we were seated outside facing the strip.

This resort/casino is our favorite in Vegas, and this trip confirmed it. Check-in was quick and painless, and we received a king bed luxury suite on the 34th floor. View of the mountains/airport in the distance. I know the strip view is considered the \"upgraded view\" but I much prefer the mountain view! I pulled a chair up to the large window and sat for awhile watching the planes take off and land (in the distance.) I thought the room was well kept, even though you could see a little wear and tear. This is to be expected, we first were there in 2008 right after the hotel opened. While there were a few worn spots here or there, it was nothing offensive at all, and I was very pleased with the room and the cleanliness. -Ate at the Grand Lux Cafe every morning for breakfast. Ended up doing the buffet each morning...not because we are huge eaters but mainly because it was the best deal. They have all the staples: waffles, omelettes, bacon, eggs, hashbrown potatoes, lots of fruit, cereal, breakfast pastries, etc. The orange juice is fresh squeezed and it is to DIE for! Would have paid for the buffet just for that :) -Lunches were usually by the pool at Solaro, and it was very good. Surprisingly good for a poolside cafe. Enjoyed huge burgers one day, and a yummy fresh, crisp caesar salad the next. Frozen drinks were great...although the pool staff was short staffed the first day we were there. I think it was the first warm day Vegas had had in a long time, and they weren't ready for the onslaught of pool visitors. The great thing is that they quickly remedied that situation and had many more pool bartenders out the next day. Bravo Palazzo! -Lunch at Dos Caminos was perfect as usual...it is pretty quiet around lunchtime. We ordered the famous guacamole (do it - it is as good as they say) and ordered tacos (fish for me, chicken for DH) It is well made Tex-Mex food, good quality ingredients, and the atmosphere only adds to the experience. This is a chain restaurant, but we were pleased with the Palazzo location. Will go back. -We decided one night to try Carnevino, one of the steakhouses in the Palazzo. We hadn't heard anything good or bad about this place, so we just randomly decided we were in the mood for steak. I don't know if the stars were in line or we just lucked out but this place was FANTASTIC. Seriously, one of the best meals we've ever had, anywhere. And we eat out a lot. To this day, when we eat out, we'll say \"That was good, but it still wasn't as good as Carnevino!!!\" We ordered the fried calamari, and the insalata romana (caesar salad) to start. We both had the 8oz filet, and ordered sides of parmigiano zeppole (TO DIE FOR GREAT! Like crispy puffs of cheesy potato-y goodness) and sauteed broccolini with pork belly. We didn't even talk to each other during the meal it was so fantastic! We were too stuffed for dessert, but it was a pleasant stuffed feeling. YUM is the only way to sum it up.... -Did some shopping in the Palazzo shops and the Venetian shops...very pleasant to stroll along and window shop. Love the fresh flowers in the Palazzo shops...beautiful to look at. -Canyon Ranch Spa: OH WOW. We booked a facial for me and a massage for the hubby. We spent at least 4 hours in the spa! Between the treatments, the lounges, the jacuzzis, the steam room, the Turkish sauna, the rainforest showers, the aromatherapy heat room, the salt relaxation room...you get the picture...we were in heaven. This spa experience is WORTH EVERY PENNY. Will most definitely do the spa again. Husband isn't even a spa person and he is already begging me to go back. -So, what about the gambling, right?? Well, believe it or not, we are not huge gamblers. I played the penny slots for 10 minutes, and he played roulette for about 45 minutes. He won playing roulette, so that was icing on the cake for us. We don't come here for gambling, but the casino is nice, clean, relatively smoke-free (as much as it can be) and nicely spaced. We never noticed much of a crowd, and we were there during March Madness. All in all, another delightful trip to the Palazzo!

The line was kind of long but there were plenty of registration staff on hand to move the line quickly. No surprise that the entire process was a breeze and everyone, and I mean everyone, greeted us like royalty. Elevators were across the casino but were directly off the casino floor. This is always a definite plus in my book. Security is located just before the elevators and they request to see your room key before allowing you to pass.

Our room 47-727 was on the 47th floor overlooking the Northeast side of the valley and the Wynn golf course. Both my wife and I thought the room was outstanding. The decor and layout gave it a real \u201chomey\u201d feeling and not that of a hotel room. They did a great job dividing the room into sections without using walls. When you first walk in the spacious bathroom was on the left and included a nicely sized and conveniently located LED TV. As you enter the main room the king size bed was on the left and a 40 some inch LED on the right. Separating the bed area from a sitting area was a thigh high bench partition. The sitting area included a comfy wrap around couch with a good sized coffee table with another LED TV sitting on top of the snack station. In the same area was a small table with a couple of chairs and a desk for working which included an Ethernet cable for internet access, telephone, pen and paper, and a multi-function printer with USB hookup for continence. Both the Palazzo and Venetian are upscale properties in a great area of the strip they are next store to the Wynn and across the street from TI (Treasure Island). Between the two properties are many dinning and shopping choices to choose from and browse. The Palazzo and Venetian casinos are among my favorite places to gamble on the strip as they offer and wide variety of slot, VP, and table games. Their slot selection is a good mix of new and classic style machines. I always seem to be able to play here and consider it a good value for my dollar. I rarely have problems with drink service here. Top shelf drinks are available and cocktail waitress ratio to patrons is good. Another plus is I find that their waitresses engaged and very friendly which is always a plus in my book.

The Palazzo is a very beautiful property with a beautiful lobby, casino, shopping mall, gym, spa, pool, elevators, and theaters. As other reviewers have stated, there is an enormous amount of fragrance pumped through the casino (but it's relatively smoke free in comparison to others); rooms are free of this fragrance. This trip was for a multi-generational family consisting of father, mother, teenage daughter, and grandmother. Service----------------- After 8.5 hours of driving, it was just heaven to catch the elevator to the 23rd floor and get checked in at the concierge desk with zero wait time; the staff explained the amenities , how to get to my room, offered baggage assistance, and accommodated my additional guest with out much issue (other than a reminder of the extra $50 per day charge.) We interacted with the concierge staff again to book phantom of the opera tickets (which they printed for us right there), rent DVDs from the library, and for extra robes and slippers (which are very nice by the way.) Room------------------ About 800 sq ft of just gorgeous room, furnished in a transition style -- it was both traditional in terms of flourishes but modern in terms of a more spare application of them. The color scheme was gray, mauve, brown, and cream and was very pleasant. The bathroom was a 12X12 marble covered dream with a huge soaking tub and separate shower and toilet room, and it included just wonderful lemon-verbena scented soaps, shampoo, conditioner, and bath salt! They really thought of everything. The beds were comfortable and nicely made every day, the sofa bed was both comfortable to sit on and slightly less comfortable to sleep on. Linens seemed to be of high quality. The table seating area was nice and the desk and printer/fax machine in the room was very nice -- there was also WIFI and wired internet access available there and it was very easy to connect to. Reading other reviews on tripadvisor.com, there were complaints of thefts and I didn't experience any issues with this at all. One evening we were surprised to find our ice container filled and chocolates on the bed -- I think someone must have called in to housekeeping for that and just gave the wrong room number or something (which is odd.) Location & Amenities--------------------- The location is kind of on the end of the strip, so it feels a little remote, but that's kind of nice. We could watch the TI-siren show from our room's window; and hear it completely from right outside the lobby. Breakfast in the lounge: oatmeal, fruit, breads, pastries, cold cereal, and hot cinnamon rolls are offered everyday -- they rotate in cheese omlettes, cheese blintz. Beverages for breakfast include the typical cast: coffee, tea, juices, milk -- or you can get a cappuccino, latte, or mocha made for you (gratis!) I loved the cheese danish, mini-croissants, and the fresh fruit was of impeccable quality. All day sodas and bottled water are also free -- so stock up and carry them around with you, you'll save quite a bit this way. Evening reception: nightly a full open bar is available with hot hours d'oerves -- soup, raw vegetables, hot savory bits, and roasted salted nuts; on one Friday night, Mario Battali's restaurant \"Carnevio\" did a presentation of their on-site made cured meats, stake tartare, eggplant, and large-pearl couscous & pea salad. That was an even nicer treat. What they labeled as dessert was a let down, it was just cookies -- some fancy ones, but still just cookies. Also the website said they would have an \"afternoon presentation\" -- I figured some cold cuts, cheese, and bread at noon -- but there was actually nothing. What made up for those inconsistencies (i.e. between the on-line description of the concierge suites and what you actually got) was the fantastic service, beautiful decor, lovely place-settings, and real silverware. Restaurants----------------------- We tried a few restaurants for dinner and lunch in the hotel and that's were we saw the most inconsistencies in quality and service. - Aquanox (lunch): fantastic! We ordered bay shrimp cocktails for $1.99, crab-cake burger, bacon-cheese burger, lobster bisque, and Mediterranean chicken salad. All were excellent, except the chicken salad which was slightly over-dressed and caused the greens to wilt prematurely. - Pinot Brasserie (dinner): ok... This was a let down as it was an expensive dinner, where only one person was completely satisfied. We ordered the short-ribs (requested well done, they were delivered medium), seafood linguine, lamb (this was liked), and scallops (one was cooked properly, the other two were mostly raw -- but seafood quality seemed to be sushi grade.) The flavors of the food were good, but we were all surprised at all the garlic slices in the sauces -- it is supposed to be French food and their style typically involves straining sauces to remove the 'identifying' ingredients -- possibly that's just the chef's intent. - Dal Toro (dinner): We ordered seafood risotto (good but a shell broke and the chef nor waitstaff noticed, and I got to pick out shell bits at the table), Chilean sea bass crocant (this was also excellent, fish was cooked perfectly). The tiramisu was the best I've ever had anywhere. Best & Worst --------------------- Aquanox was the BEST restaurant we tried during our trip. The concierge suites made the trip a breeze and the staff were excellent. The Palazzo, while not non-smoking, seems to have more non-smoking areas than most casinos and was therefore more pleasant and not foul-smelling. The worst: San Gennaro Grill at the Venetian -- I got sick from a tomato and mozzarella panini (I don't even know how that's possible.) The tomatoes were so un-ripe they were very hard to bit through; my stomach hurt for literally hours.", "Date": "April 10, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Salt Lake City", "Title": "\u201cUnidentified stains on sectional\u201d", "Author": "Crazypugs", "ReviewID": "UR60947545", "Content": "This is a very nice resort. However, there are two issues. The first is that the furniture in the rooms is really worn.

A colleague said there were stains all over the marble floor in his room and discarded water bottles and expired milk from the previous guest. The second issue is that they do not have the resources to handle guests when they are at high capacity. This could mean you will wait an hour in line to check in, depending on what time you are checking in, or it could mean that you are told it will take an hour for them to bring you oatmeal for room service breakfast. It might also mean that you pay $20 per day to use their exercise room, only to find all the treadmills being used--really, if they are going to charge you to use the exercise room, they should have enough exercise equipment that you don't have to wait.

We were in L V for a week and stayed at the Signature at MGM for 4 nights and then moved on to the Palazzo to see what a hotel on the strip was like. We had rented a car and arrived about 3pm parking in self park and then setting out to find check-in. A bit of along queue, but it moved fairly quickly and the guy on reception was very nice although he did try to get us upgrade,but didn't hard sell. We asked for a high room and was given a room on the 37th floor, we had already paid for a \"luxury\" view (the L V Strip). He went on explain that the mini bar was very sensitive if you tried to use it to store your own food/drink (a very useful thing to know as I would most likely have tried to keep our own snacks cool!!!) As we had self parked we couldn't get help with our bags as they do not go in the parking area, only if you valet park. A bit of a bummer as it meant two trips for my poor other half. The room was very nice, if a little dark because of the decor, but the view outweighed this little niggle. We looked out on to T I and the strip, a truly fantastic view.Seating area, bed and bathroom all to a good standard, with added bonus of remote control curtains!!!.The room was of a good size and easily comfortable for 2 people. We had a good internet connection which although \"free\" you actually paid for in your resort fee of about $16/day, plus a mini office with fax and printer. The room was cleaned daily and towels replaced. We used the room service for breakfast and whilst a bit overpriced the food was hot and delivered when we asked. I would recommend going to the Grand Lux Cafe for breakfast, choose the buffet with unlimited juice and coffee and you have truly wonderful breakfast, the choice is limited but with omelette and eggs cooked to order you can't go wrong. They also do a really nice evening meal. Check out was painless and even though we left the room 30mins after check out time, no comment was made. My only gripe would be the lack of a coffee maker in the rooms. I do like to be able to make a coffee when I want, but sadly here the policy is not to put coffee makers in rooms, instead you are expected to use room service and of course pay twice the price.

After an hour wait for the boxes, I called the business center and they told me that a request was never made and that it would cost me $14.00 to get them. Well I asked what they wanted me to do, I just told the to charge the packages to the room since we had waited an hour for them. After opening our drapes I was angry at what we saw. My wife was there to relax and spend time in the room, by the time we checked out she had a migrane from the noise from outside the windows.

A small bathroom off the main entry was very small hard to enter, you had to put your back to the wall unless you were very small or a child. In my case a tall large frame male. The bedroom was separate from the living room by a door and was large, a sitting chair and hassock, king bed again not too different than a king luxury just a little more walking around area and a larger lcd tv 46-50inch. The bathroom off the the master bedroom was large, again a waste of area, their was a jucuzzi tub located in between a set of sinks, this tub is only large enough for one person, you might be able to fit 2 really tight. The shower is large very large again lots of wasted spacee unless the family showers together, the shower does have 3 fixed shower heads mounted to the wall butt , knee and ankle high with a hand held shower head, no seat, 6 foot long, so you can't sit and relax (this should have been a steam room for the quaility and price of the suite. The suite was clean and with a small amount of wear and tear, after you see its location you will understand why, We tried to move our location with no results other than our checkout to a king luxury. We were promised a high floor with a golf course view upon check in (Siena Suite). If I had known what they were going to do ahead of time, we would of changed hotels on this trip. As far as room service, 54 dollars for a small pot of coffe, 1 omelet, home fries (soft and warm) 4 sausage links, 2 small croissants, and 1 bagel, (not what I ordered) the food tasted off, not sure if they used real eggs, meat was just warm and greasy, bagel just warm and coffee was strong and bitter, last day there we were happy just to be leaving the Palazzo than complain. To be honest this was a comped room, when I contacted our host I explained to him I had a similar comp from MGM-Mirage(suite with jucizzi) and If he would match it we would stay at the Palazzo, I feel that, they over comped us(Siena Suite) and didn't want to provide what was promised up front for a gold card member. Our play of 1000 cash+, plus roll over (wins) a day in the slots covered the comp for 3 nights, the 4th night 1000 cash + play went to the 3 night siena suite comp and they wouldn't cover the 4th night in the luxury king. I wasn't warned of this during the stay only upon check out on the last day. When we went to change rooms at 11am they didn't have our second room ready , this was another room that was supposed to be assigned, they told us we could keep the Siena until our room was ready. several hours later we recieved a call our seond room was ready and that they would send a bell man to the room to go straight to our suite inwhich my wife did, upon arrive she was locked out and 30 minutes later no bellman, well I went up stairs to our new room and no clothes, no wife so I went down to the siena and my wife had to go to the bathroom so bad she was hopping around, so off to the casino she went, the housekeeping manager was walking around and won't let me into the suite, finally after a 10 minute wait security showed up, but no bellman, What bull this was finally a bellman showed up after a hour to move us. To charge me 140 dollars for a king luxury after placing us in a Siena with a view of airconditioner units and walls for 3 nights, poor customer service, they lost a customer forever. I spoke to several host about these problems and was finally told that our ex-host over extended his ability by placing us in a Siena Suite, between over 4k in cash play plus winnings played in slots just covered the Seina and they wouldn't comp the luxury king. I was told they were making changes to their host system. From what I understood, they were making a new job position (semi host) for gold card players and below. After years of staying at the Palazzo Venetian, this was the last visit.to the Palazzo . I read a post about Sheldon catering to Veterans don't belive it, because I forgot my lic one night and used my DOD Department of Defense ID, 100% Disable Veteran, they wouldn't accept it as proof of ID and the treatment we recieved was less then any paying customer, because of the room comp. I don't believe they would have placed a paying customer in the room we had. Look forward to long waits, poor cocktail service, weak well drinks, they state are premium liquor, on the slot floor. The Palazzo like other Hotels are understaffed and will tell you cash brings better upgrades when you arrive, so forget about even asking for an upgrade unless your willing to pay the difference. :)", "Date": "March 22, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Sleep Quality": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "LA", "Title": "\u201cDO NOT STAY HERE...HORRIBLE SERVICE, HORRIBLE HOTEL\u201d", "Author": "CAlexisC412", "ReviewID": "UR59208898", "Content": "We had originally booked at The Venetian but when we checked in, we were told that they had overbooked and sent us to The Palazzo.

When the hotel merely changed the room and didn't offer any \"makeups\" (MGM gave me 2 free buffets when something similar happened) I knew it was time to stick to the Palazzo. Well, now it's time to bid adieu to both properties as management has clearly decided that service and cleanliness no longer apply at this property. While the rooms are less worn than at the Venetian (only because it's newer) and they have the electric shades/drapes, there's very little else here that makes it worth spending money for, especially when other properties are fighting for our travel dollars. You are charged a $16 nightly resort fee (incl. tax) that gets you unlimited local and 800 calling (have a cell phone so I don't need it), free internet access (could never get past the sign up page \"accept\" button) and access to their Fitness Room. This is only access to the gym and NOT the spa facilities which requires an additional $20 upfee but the gym is large and has everything (it just takes forever to walk there from the Palazzo). The rooms are spacious and the bed is comfortable but the rooms are not always clean. And the evidence I have to prove that is that during my 2 night stay there recently, housekeeping did not ONCE service my room. Even after making 3 requests and being told that a maid was assigned to my room, I was disappointed to see that when I returned to my room at 10pm that nothing had been done. Discussions with the general manager on site did nothing to rectify the situation, only a weak apology and no effort to compensate, just a promise that I would receive better service the next time (who said there would be a next time). It's obvious that management has cut back on expenses during the recession but cutting back on cleanliness makes me wonder if they're risking more serious consequences (novovirus anyone?) by doing so. I would NOT recommend this hotel or it's sister property the Venetian to anyone, except my worst enemies (let them get sick, not me!). If you want 5 star service, go next door to the Wynn where they understand that concept (and it's usually cheaper too!).

I can't understand complaints about noisy ventilation; the thermostats allow users to select the fan speed. Yes, it's noisy at high speeed, but was very unobtrusive on medium or low.

The weather was lovely - over 100 degrees most days, and it didn't get much below that during the night at the time we were there. Hotel Room We were in a luxury suite (which is one of the standard rooms) on the 44th floor - which had views across the mountains and of the runway for the airport. It had a huge king size bed, which was very comfortable, lovely pillows and bedding. There was plenty of closet and drawer space and a flat screen TV. The bathroom was huge - over 120 sq feet - with a seperate shower, tub and wc. The wc even had a self closing seat and lid. There was a small'ish flat screen TV above the double sink area. Downa few steps to the sunken living room area, which had a large corner couch and coffee table. A third flat screen TV. Electronic drapes and roman blinds, and a safe. Hotel Pool Area The Palazzo shared a pool area with it's neighbouring sister hotel, the Venetian, meaning each hotel had it's own pool area, but you could use either as they were adjoining at the front side of the hotels. Large soft towels were a plenty, comfy loungers - some with thick mattresses, and a number of pools - around 10 or so ( I don't think we saw them all!). The pool staff would pass round chilled orange slices, cucumber slices and chilled face flannels - which were very refreshing in the desert heat. The pool area was very peaceful - we never had trouble finding a place to relax. Casino, Shops, Reception and Restaurants Large, bright and airy casino. Nice selection of restaurants and bars - in he hotel and in the shopping mall which you could walk through to get to the Venetian's next door. The reception staff on the front desk were very friendly and welcoming, and as helpful as you could wish for. We have been to Las Vegas 7 times, and stayed at 12 of the hotels on or just off of the Strip.

This hotel ticks all the usual Vegas boxes. It\u2019s still newish (2yrs old); it\u2019s big and is clad in enough marble to bring a tear to the eye of even the most ambitious Renaissance sculptor. But beneath the mirage of post-Raphaelite Italy is there anything new or unique about this hotel? Well in short-no. Perhaps it\u2019s because Vegas receives so many tourists we found the check in to be professional if a little per functionary. During the process of handing over your id and credit card for billing purposes later, the reception casually slip into the conversation that there is a $15 US dollar per-day \u201cresort fee\u201d on top of your room rate to pay. We had booked via an agent and the resort fee was explained to us and was payable if we intended to use the services that it covered ergo (daily newspaper, use of pool/gym and internet). However, we were told by reception staff that this wasn\u2019t the case and the fee was mandatory on all guests. An argument was the last thing we wanted after a 26hr plane trip from Perth Western Australia. So with a couple of polite but stern words the fee was removed. Just as a side: how can resorts such as the Palazzo and others in Vegas justify charging a \u201cresort fee?\u201d We have stayed at many 5-star hotels around the world and all of them thus far manage to provide the amenities mentioned within the cost of the room rate per night. So to the room or suite as they prefer to call it, but first, like all Vegas casino hotels you have to run the gauntlet of navigating the gaming floor before you can access the guest lifts at the far end of the gaming floor. Finally you make your room. All in all the room was well furnished and proportioned. However, the hotel had made no acknowledgement of the fact that we were on our honeymoon unlike LA or Dubai who laid on chocolates, specialty cake and drinks. It\u2019s a split level room with the bed as you enter and two steps leading down to a sunken lounge area which gives the room depth and definition and adds to the illusion of extra space. In this space there is one or two things that are not quite right. One, there is no master controls switch near your bed that controls all the lights (standard in most 5 star hotels). Two, there is no tea or coffee making facilities in the room. Now I know having read a lot of reviews on this site that this gets mentioned a lot (particular in regards to American hotels in general.) I realise that this service is more common in Asian and European hotels, but one has to ask the question again, just what are you getting for your money? This may sound a bit like knit-picking but it isn\u2019t. These are the little things that one remembers. In general our stay both in Vegas and the Palazzo was pleasant, but a casino is a casino is a casino no matter where it is. Before I finish, we would also recommend Pink Jeep tours. We took their tour of the Grand Canyon tour and it was fantastic! In the endless cornucopia of themed casinos that is Vegas, The Palazzo holds its own. Would we stay here again? Perhaps we would. However, Vegas by day in winter reminded me of an \u201cold drag queen\u201d who has applied his makeup too heavy once too often.

She waited for security to come to her room, and when they didn't arrive, she went to registration and waited another 15 min. I was awoken the first night by my noisy neighbor arriving at their room at 3AM, quite loud in the hall and I could hear what they were saying in their room. I was then awoken at 5:30 am by continuous retching from my neighbor that was quite graphic for more than an hour. Certainly no sound proofing! I attended my meeting for the day and returned to my room which smelled quite strongly of smoke. I called housekeeping and was informed that the floor below me was a smoking floor but they could \"ionize\" my room as long as I was gone for two hours. I notified them at 2:30 pm that they could install the ionizer. I returned to my room at 8 pm. My electronic key did not work. There was a maid across the hall and she told me to go back to the elevator and call security. So I did, the phone didn't work. I returned to my room and the maid allowed me to radio her contact directly. He told me a security person would arrive shortly. A security person came down the hall, but told me he couldn't help me because he was assigned to another issue. After he stood down the hall, doing what looked to me like nothing, he still wasn't able to help me. I called the front desk twice and was told someone would be with me shortly. Another 10 minutes later, I became angry and was told by the security person, that continued to do nothing down the hall but stand there, to go to the front desk. He followed me to the elevator and then told me to get off with him on another floor if I wanted \"him to help me.\" Well, excuse me, but no way was I going to get off on an empty floor with a strange man!!! I don't care if they're hotel security. He didn't seem to want to help me when I was on my floor! I went all the way ( a long way!) back to the front desk and the desk person was very polite and contrite, She gave me new keys. I proceeded back to my room, the new keys didn't work!!! I went back down to the desk and spoke with the same woman. She was very apologetic and didn't seem to get a good answer from her supervisor, but assured me that engineering was taking care of my issue. I headed back to my room, a security person was walking down the hall and I asked them to make sure I could get into my room. My keys worked., but there was still the ionionizer machine going in my room. I called housekeeping and was assured someone would come remove it. I waited about 10 minutes and then chose to disconnect it and put it in the hallway. I had someone about 15 min. later try to get into my room without knocking, but I had the security lock engaged and told them the machine was in the hallway, and then an hour later someone else came again for the same issue!! For a hotel of this supposed caliber, this was unacceptable! I have traveled all over the world for work and pleasure and this has been one of the most disappointing stays I have encountered.

In the meantime they suggested we have a drink, gamble, etc. (at our expense, of course!). After 50 min. of sitting at a bar we decided to call the hotel to see how much longer it would be (not exactly the 'shortly' we were told when checking in). The woman who answered said that our room was ready!! WHAT?!! When were they going to call us? She said they only 'pull reports periodically'. Well, the hotel we stayed at the previous 3 nights called us promptly when the room was ready - which is how customers should be treated. The room was wonderful - really appreciated the space. But beyond that, there wasn't anything to tip the scales towards the Palazzo vs. other nice hotels.

However, our impressions were: 1. Property The hotel looks great and creates a good first impression on arrival. The casino looked pretty much like all the others, though perhaps a little smarter than some. We stayed in a Fortuna suite - at just shy of 1,000 square feet it was an enormous space. All the fixtures and fittings were in good condition and it was definitely worthy of a five star hotel. We particularly liked the large L shaped sofa. As a tip to anyone looking at staying in this room, in all honesty (given the size of the standard room) it is probably not worth the extra money. The fixtures and fittings are all the same, you simply have a large space between the living room and the bed. 2. Cleanliness This was a bit of a let down - I think their staff have too many rooms to clean and are cutting corners as a result. For example, during our 4 days there we noticed (a) they did not replace dirty wine glasses with clean ones; (b) my other half used the ironing board once and they just left it in mid-room for 3 days; (c) our toiletries were not replaced on the 3rd day (we actually had no shower gel as a result); (d) part of our room service food was not taken away and (e) a dressing gown which had been left on the bed was unceremoniously thrown over a chair rather than folded up. In addition the window looking out on the strip was filthy and had not been cleaned for sometime. It spoiled the view. 3. Service Poor (and as a result we would not stay again). I don't know how the other large strip hotels compare but it felt like a real effort to get any assistance at all. There are 2 examples I would give. Firstly, on our last day I wanted a later checkout (the default checkout time is 11am). I called the front desk (via one of those irritating automated \"press 1 for billing, press 2 for general information......\" systems) and waited 10 minutes on hold for \"one of our agents\" to come on. When I asked if we could extend checkout to 13.30 they said that an extension to midday was free (wow - in my experience all half decent hotels have midday as the standard checkout time) but an extension to 13.30 would cost me 50 dollars plus taxes. My only conclusion from this is that they don't want repeat business... Second example was the room service - we ordered and it took an hour for the food to come. They still hit us with the ful gratuity and the extra 4 dollar delivery charge which I found irritiating giveln that it was hardly a smooth service. 4. Resort Fee Beware the resort fee of 16 dollars a day. We could not get the wifi in our room to work and we didn't use the healthclub. I'm therefore not really clear why we handed them 60 plus dollars over 4 days for absolutely nothing. 5. Restaurants We ate in dos Caminos one night - it was very good indeed. The remainder of the restaurants looked good. Be warned though, there is an emphasis towards the higher end price bracket so if you want something more simple (as most of us do on holiday) then go elsewhere. 6. Shopping Designer shops galore in the (slightly bland) mall section. Mostly they were deserted when we were there. Not a lot else to say - if you want more reasonably priced fare head to the fashion mall across the road. Final conclusion - with so many other hotels to choose from, we would go elsewhere in future, in search of better service.", "Date": "January 11, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Nhulunbuy, Oz", "Title": "\u201cPalazzo is palatial!\u201d", "Author": "C-Bernie", "ReviewID": "UR53151033", "Content": "I chose this hotel after reading numerous reviews on Las Vegas hotels.

We had noisy neighbours on the first night - much slamming of doors in the hallway. We booked a Grand Canyon tour through the concierge and the staff were great as our tour was cancelled due to Obama visit and had to be rescheduled. They kept us informed of the changes. Only complaint was we had difficulty finding pickup point for our tour as it was at the Venetian Resort and the directions were vague to say the least and also nothing was signposted. After wandering around for half an hour we just made the pickup - and this was after asking several staff for directions - but we were on holidays and the Grand Canyon quickly made us forget!

It is not possible to walk in a straight line through the casino/hotel/shopping complexes and get somewhere in a hurry.

The free valet was a lovely perk, but walking into the lobby I wasn't so impressed with their fall/winter wreath theme. It was a bit grotesque, to be honest. Upon check-in we were helped by a great guy who had the answers to all our questions. From him we learned that the hotel can provide a mini fridge at no charge as long as it's for medical purposes, and for our case we had a family member with diabetic supplies and needed a refrigerator for his medications. To use the internet you'd have to pay a $15/day 'resort fee' which includes use of the gym, the pool and other amenities. But I believe if you go down to the 2nd floor where the shops are and look for the Caf\u00e9 Presse/Lavazza Cafe, you can use their free WiFi there. We were given the teal-themed Bella suite which faced the Wynn's golf course and the Nevada mountain range. The suite was very spacious and nicely appointed, but when I walked into the bathroom I noticed the doors don't lock, including the one for the enclosed toilet cubicle. Also there was no toilet paper - and when I requested for that and an extra blanket, I was informed that the hotel was running an hour behind on all requests. This went on for the three nights we stayed there - which was pretty understandable since it was a busy New Year's Eve weekend. I noticed the dust on some of the furniture and in-room electronics such as the clock radio, the fax/copy/print machine and the vanity in the bathroom. There were also hardened stuck-on bits of crumbs/food on the carpet and pieces of chips on the couch. Perhaps because it's such a big suite housekeeping does not have enough time to pay attention to those little details. The pull-out sofa sleeper was a lovely addition. I also love having three LCD TVs in the suite so the kids and the adults can watch their own shows. I loved going down to the shops and actually snagged a great deal on a shirt at the Ralph Lauren store. And since the shop level directly connects to the shops at the Venetian, we had ample opportunity to browse and enjoy the sights. The way the hotel is structured makes for a more hassle-free stay. It's simple yet elegant, but not too gaudy or flashy. Despite the small details that turned me off a bit, the Palazzo turned out to be just perfect for our family. One tip, though - the ice machine takes some work to locate. It's in its own room behind a door that looks just like the suites' - except there's a little sign on the door that says \"Ice\".

With the cushion against the vent the noise level in the room dropped back to an acceptable level. Sounds ridiculous but it was so loud we were ready to check out if no solution was found. #3. They have an 11:00 checkout policy which is ridiculous for Vegas. I suspect some bright spark in management thinks this is a good way of generating additional revenue ?

Although my company provides a generous daily meal allowance, a meal within the Palazzo (or the connecting Venetian) would not have fit into the allowance so I ate several times across the street at the Treasure Island Resort. I highly recommend Pho, the Vietnamese restaurant at TI. I wish there was more casual dining places within the Palazzo but this hotel doesn't seem like the place that caters to the casual diners. The shops were premium boutique type places. I window shopped on some down time but wasn't really interested in what was being sold.

Our floor and my parents floor kept having a sewage smell near the elevators that grossed us out every time. The room was spacious and had cool features such as an L-shaped couch, remote control drapes, and three televisions throughout the suite but for a room that should only be about two years old it showed a lot of wear and tear.

I've been to Vegas four times now for work, and this was my first stay at the Palazzo. I usually am at the Venetian, although I have stayed at Caesars Palace once. I thought the Palazzo was the mirror image of the Venetian. The rooms are exactly like the rooms in the Venetian. Both are all-suite hotels, and once you have checked in, you really wouldn't know which one you were in if not for the signs telling you and a few differences in shops. They have the exact same layouts which take you through the casino to the elevators that take you to your room. The room's layout is as follows: You walk into the room, and on your left is a wall-size mirror (that I always swear has special fun-house glass that makes you look trimmer than you actually are), and on the right are double-doors leading into a marble bathroom. The bathroom has a vanity and stool where you can do your makeup, a double-vanity, a large soaking tub, a TV and a glassed-in shower. There is a also a separate room with a toilet. Walk through your foyer into a large bedroom that has a king size bed, a dresser of drawers, and a flat screen TV. There is also a remote for controlling your shades and curtains. Go down a few steps into your living room/office, and this also had a television and minibar. The Palazzo is very convenient if you are attending a convention in the Sands Expo, which was why I was there. My company has a big convention every December in Vegas and it's always at the Sands. Since my day starts at about 6 a.m. and can go past 10 p.m., it's nice to not have to worry about transportation. However, it can also mean that I may go days without ever seeing the outdoors. You don't have to leave because every service imaginable, from a state-of-the-art fitness center, to a spa, to numerous restaurants and shops, even a Walgreens is all on the premesis. A few tips: It's very dry in December in Vegas. Ask for a humidifier, and they will bring you one at no charge. Since I'm there for work, I like to have healthy food and drink options without having to buy stuff from the hotel. I go to Walgreens and get bottled water, diet soda, granola bars, etc. to keep in my room. The Palazzo charges $25/day for a fridge, and since Im there at least a week, I don't want to pay that. I just refill my ice bucket every day and put one water and one soda in it to chill. Lastly, be prepared to hear Gerard Butler singing \"The Music of the Night\" every freaking time you get on the elevator. By the end of my stay, I never ever wanted to see Phantom of the Opera again, and I've only seen it once. Overall, the Palazzo is a great place to stay, but just remember -- you don't need to stay in Vegas for long. If you don't have a lot of money to gamble and see shows, it can get old fast. Maybe I've just been there too many times for work and need to go for a vacation! I did see the Terry Fator show this time, but I felt that it wasn't really worth it. He seems to be moving away from using the puppets/dummies toward singing in his own voice songs that he has written himself, and neither is very good. I wish he'd stuck with the act that got him there in the first place. We were excited to find out that even though we didn't buy the most expensive tickets, that ours were still considered VIP, so we were first in line to meet him. (He meets everyone at his shows and signs autographs.) He also has a photog to take your picture with him, but he wants $44 for the picture, which in my opinion was way too much!", "Date": "December 30, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia", "Title": "\u201cConnected to Venetian...\u201d", "Author": "nshafz", "ReviewID": "UR52130770", "Content": "Every year we go to Venetian, sometimes we stayed at Rio a few days and a few days at Venetian.

Hopefully this was just an off moment for them. Overall, Palazzo remains one of our top choices in Las Vegas.

We basicly were only able to use the internet and not the pool since it was winter. The sofa looked worn out-velvet material that was out dated.

The bathroom was amazing, it had a separate toilet section, 2 sinks and the bath was nice and big and filled up really quickly - i think i took a bath every day!! it had a little dresser area with stool, a big mirror and lights all round which was really good for straightening my hair and doing my make up! It also had a hairdryer - and a good quality one too, not one of those you get that you have to keep pressed for it to work! I dont like to have a mess everywhere when i stay in hotels so it was nice to be able to keep my hairbrush and make up and all in the little drawer in the dresser area! Yes it was a very big hotel but signposted quite well with different banks of lifts for different levels. When we arrived and checked in we asked if we had a high floor - the girl at reception said we were currently on the 10 or 17th floor (i cant remember sorry!) and we asked if she had anything higher. She checked and gave us a room on the 33rd floor. We ate once at the grand lux cafe for brunch - i had a waffle which was massive! and my husband had some breakfast type thing egg and hash browns or something. Tasty food and portions were big. We also ate once at the italian restaurant dal toro, the food was nice and tasty but the portions were not massive. Since we are from the UK, we find the portions in a lot of US restaurants too big for us and sometimes share. We did ask the waitress who said the portions were quite big and it may be best to share but when the pasta out in two plates there was hardly anything there! We would have been able to have one dish each. The casino was fine - i have never been to vegas before and dont often frequent casinos so dont know whats good and bad, but it wasnt smokey and i was playing all through the night saturday on the penny slots as we stayed up all night to catch our flight early sunday morning. but it was cold! and that goes for all the casinos on the strip. the a/c is cranked up SO high i was wearng a hoodie (with the hood on) and tracksuit bottoms! I am not keen on going to a hot place and having to wear cardigans and jumpers and socks etc - it doesnt seem right when the temp outside is over 40 degrees!! We got room service once - just fries - and the presentation was great. we got a little table to ourselves and napkins and mini heinz ketchup glass bottles, but the fries themselves were not great. They were rather dry and not hot. And it was expensive. About 25 dollars for 2 bowls of fries. The rooms were slightly dark in the daytime - not bright and the lighting wasnt the best. but we were hardly in during the day. The location is pretty good - not completely central but it is connected to the venetian, the wynn, which in turn is connected to fashion show mall and you can easily get to TI and Mirage which are right across the road. We went hotel hopping and walked to caesars and then to bellagio - it didnt take too long considering. Very nice decor in the hotel and rooms and it is very romantic indeed. We took a gondola ride in the venetian which was really nice. The palazzo is a lot quieter than the venetian but they are connected and essentially one and the same, so it wa nice to spend time during the day in the venetian and then come away from the hustle and bustle at night. Would definitely recommend. oh, and we paid 119 on the weekdays and 159 on weekends. came with a few extras like 20% off dal toro, and 25 dollar slot credit and a couple of other extras.", "Date": "December 18, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "5.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Dallas, Texas", "Title": "\u201cThey've got it figured out - great stay - definitely go back!\u201d", "Author": "Suzanidoo", "ReviewID": "UR51314107", "Content": "My husband and I absolutely loved the Palazzo.

Since Nov of 2008(previous review), Ive stayed at the Palazzo three times, May, July and Nov. Each of the stay was perfect and the amenities, shops and services was perfect as well....(even though i dont get my room fuzzy slippers ...due to recession/cutbacks?) We traveled with 2 other couples during the same trips and their view is the same as well. They did venture out to try something different for one trip out of the 4 to try something different, ie stay at Mandalay Bay and Encore, Palazzo still ranks at the top of the comparison. If not for the resort amenities but because of location, location, location. The room of 730 sqft on the 45th was superb but for the first time, theres no sunken living room. It was all at the same level. Not sure how the floor to floor/stacking works up on the 45th floor and higher. A great view with the \"strip view\" and since it was at the 45th floor, it takes on a whole new meaning to \"view\". You actually see the mountains off in the distance and not distracted by TI across the street. The mountains actually greets you as you operate the remote drapes and look out from the bed. Nice! The usual suspects of fine eateries were still fine. I'm not saying that I'm not adventurous in Vegas, but if you know its good and know what to expect...why stray from the path? Dined at Table 10, Sushisamba, Morels, Zines, Woo, and Canaletto. The crab trinity at Table 10 was superb if you are a crab lover....crab served 3 ways...lump crab with a light vinigarette, snow crab legs and a crab salad. Yummy! My wife was reasonable stuffed 2/3 of the way through and I had to finish it off. What a shame. Sushisamba...is there anything bad on the menu? It may seem dark and a little cramped but this is a hot spot to be seen and be seen. Morels ....great french oinion soup to die for and great steaks done to perfection....as well as an extensive wine and cheese list. Zines has some staple chinese dim sum food that is a little more expensive than what you would pay for in your home town but if thats what you crave....har gow, su mai, congee, noodles....this is where you get it (without venturing too far). Woo...gee doesn't all hot and sour soup look the same...yup...but the flavour..... Wow...BAM...i wonder what the secret ingredient is. I could have another bowl and another.... The tempura lobster wrapped in mini 'butter-leaf' lettuce topped off with chopped avocados, masago, and a ponzu type sauce...yummy!...but spendy. As usual the blackjack tables vary from $10 min in the mornings to $15 at night...and the usual slot machines could be found, if not, stroll down to the venetian. Poker over at the V was busy as usual with tournament and cash play. Shops didnt seem to busy during Black Friday but there were deals to be had. Not as impressive as the year prior, but still some good deals within the Palazzo shoppes, Fashion show mall across the street and Caesars forum shoppes. Something different that I tried was the Canyon Ranch spa...all I can say is i can still feel the effects of a 80min couples massage 2 weeks later. Its the Best thing I did! This was right in the Palazzo and based on previous reviews, there is no wandering off to the the Venetian side (did not use fitness equipment) This is worth a different review in itself based on all the different treatments you can try.....

So the other adjacent pool which is long and narrow is generally very packed in the morning. Only problem is that there is lack of lounge chair space - we are all literally on top of one another.

Our new room was 43-805 and it was *amazing.* Large TV's in the bedroom and living room, jetted tub, power window shades, THE WORKS. The property itself looks fairly new and quite clean. The hotel section of the property was quiet during our stay and elevators were quick (important, as we were on the 43rd floor). Internet was about $10 a day (MUCH cheaper that I was expecting, though we didn't use it). They have a fitness center and spa on site, but it was $40 a day to use (bummer). The casino was clean and slightly more spacious compared to the other casinos we saw during our stay. They have a \"smoke-free corridor\" from the lobby to the elevators, otherwise there were plenty of people smoking. Table staff and waitresses were friendly. They offer instructions on many table games (i.e. craps, roulette)during the day as well, for those who are new to gambling. There's plenty to do in and around the casino, with shows each evening and live music at St. Mark's square along the indoor canals. FYI, I would advise against a gondola ride. They are expensive and not private at all, as the many people walking along the canal watch as you pass by. We caught 2 cirque du soleil shows in town without a problem (Mystere and Ka, both were awesome). The food was excellent throughout the property, with the exception of Dal Toro (italian restaurant on the first floor and a major disappointment). Sadly, this quality cooking comes at quite a steep price. I knew that Vegas would be expensive, but it was a challenge to find dinner for under $90 on the property. Room service on the morning of our anniversary was timely and tasty...but $70 for eggs, toast and mimosas seems excessive. Some notably great restaurants were Tao (MUST eat here) and Dos Caminos (best margarita I've had). The location is acceptable, though it would've been nice to have a monorail stop. The walk to Harrah's next door is a long one; the monorail runs behind the casinos and they don't make it easy to get there. The worst offender was Bally's, with an openning for the monorail on the strip, but he actual stop seemed like a 2 mile walk through the casino (it seemed to be a quest for \"the monorail within\" rather than an actually stop). If you're interested in doing a lot of casino hopping here, this isn't the place for you; the ones in close proximity are Harrah's, Treasure Island (which goes by \"T.I.\" now), Wynn and Encore. There is also a mall across the street with a food court and a great selection of stores. In closing, The Palazzo is a great property with many options for entertainment and wonderful food. I'd dare say it's the cleanest and most beautiful casino/hotel on the strip.

I travelled with my wife and another couple, all who have never been to this property before. We each reserved a Palazzo Luxury suite, with a King bed. Check in was smooth, we were both able to check in at 10:30am, which is sometimes rare in Vegas. Our room was on the 17th floor (room 17836), facing the strip, while our friends had a room facing the desert, but were on the 37th floor (room 37829). I must say that the strip view is worth it, even if you are sacrificing staying on a higher floor. Our room seemed a touch larger also, as my wife and I each had a full nightstand with drawers, while our friends only had a small shelf attached to the wall. The room itself is nothing short of amazing. The bed was VERY comfortable, the bathroom was larger than some of the bedrooms in my house. Marble everywhere, private toilet, stand alone glass shower, deep soaking tub, double sinks, and a vanity for my wife to use while she did her make up! Quite impressive. The room also boasts a sunken living room featuring a large pull out sectional couch, work station for computer, desk, etc, and a table with 3 chairs, where we had our breakfast, snacks, etc. The curtains and blinds in the room are controlled via remote control, which is pretty cool. The only downside is there are only 2 options....opened and closed. No partial opening. Oh well, I got over it. The 3 plasma tv's in the room more than made up for it! :) The in room safe is large enough for a laptop computer and has an outlet built in so your computer can charge while it is in the safe. The resort itself has a great layout. The casino is smaller than some, but I prefer that. There is no shortage of restaurants in and around the casino, as the building is connected to Venetian also. We ate at Grand Lux Cafe, Noodles Asia, and Sushi Samba. One tip, do not go to Grand Lux Cafe. It was terrible. The other 2 were excellent and we can't wait to go back! We ate at SushiSamba during their happy hour, so we had the opportunity to try a few different things at a low price. The only downfall to this hotel was that upon check-in I was told that \"as part of my package\", I was entitled to free high-speed internet, free local phone calls, and access to the gym. I was pretty happy until I saw on my folio that $30.85 had been charged to my room for internet and 1 phone call. The front desk (on check out) told me that if I were to pay the $15 per day \"resort fee\", that it would have been included, but since I never used the gym, it would be cheaper to just pay for the internet. This is NOT what I was told upon checking in. Otherwise, I would have not used the internet! Also, I was charged $24 in snacks from the minifridge that were missing when I checked in. At checkout, they removed them from my bill, but she said that someone would be checking the fridge once we left. I have a feeling that I will be seeing another bill soon for the missing items we did not consume. Other than the two issues we experienced regarding billing, the resort was top notch. Some people complain about the perfume smell that Palazzo has, which is the same smell the Venetian has. I got used to it, although I could do without.

What I actually did during the trade show was make the extra walk to the trade show to get our free coffee there. The Hotel restaurants were in my opinion expensive for what you get and of course it's recommended to dine off the strip so check out off strip and \"downtown\" dining. There are fast food restaurants on the strip south of the hotel with Denny's being the closest and had great breakfasts. Walk a little further south and a few more food courts will pop up with Mac's, Subway, Del Taco, Chinees, etc. etc. In my opinion this is not a place for young children or the elderly. Way too much walking. I watched as one family took about an hour to get grandma in the huge pool. By the way I think they had three or four pools there. One they didn't open although they should have as there was no place to sit at the other pools. I think there were five hot tubs in my sight from the room view.

A couple of minor issues that should be worked on. This is a 5 star hotel yet we experienced 3 star level housekeeping. In the week we were there, we found the following: rooms were made up very late in the day (about 4pm); housekeeping missed a dirty wine glass left on the dresser in full view; and on another day an empty kleenex box which was also left in full view on the sink. The worst was one day I left our room at about 10:30 am to find the hallyway strewn with bags of dirty linen, room service trays including one in front of our room and we hadnt even had room service. Came back at around 4pm and all the mess was still there. We went down to concierge to complain. While they did respond and the mess was cleaned up, this is something I have never seen in a hotel of this level. We also found that the front desk staff were not particularly friendly.

Perhaps it is fine if you just want to go to Vegas, gamble a little and have some cocktails. I was attending a convention and trying to work while I was at the hotel recently for 6 days. The suite I upgraded to was spacious and lovely. I was happy to check in and was excited to find a printer/fax/scanner. None of that worked of course for the first day until I had the parade of 2 bellman and an engineer. Lack of fax sent me down to discover the evil package center. This is a place that you can go to send an $11 two page fax, and recover your Fed Ex packages starting at a fee of $4 and up. That's right, you pay them to get your packages that should be given to you. This struck me as illegal and I intend to inform Fed Ex about it. Definitely not right. Getting a business continental breakfast delivered for 4 took an hour and a half so the next day I asked for just coffee. For 2 hours I asked for coffee. I finally put my boyfriend on the phone who I think frightened them so badly that the server ran up to the room dropped the pot and left too fast to get a tip. I wanted to work out, but when I called the front desk they thought it would cost $30-40. They were not sure. When I went over to the Canyon Ranch workout Center they explained to me that if I purchased a daily resort fee I would get wi fi and workout included for $15 a day. News the front desk did not seem to have. In the scheme of things this sounded like a deal. But then I had to go get the wi fi charges removed from the bill. Which is harder than it sounds. Especially over the phone. For some reason they REALLY want you to come to the front desk personally for everything. Maid service is catch as catch can as well. Calling housekeeping did not seem to get it done. Finding people in the hallway proved more fruitful. But my favorite scenario came with the language around the laundry service. When I phoned one morning I was asked if I wanted same day or express. As it was 9:10 AM I answered same day. Then they explained to me that I would be getting my clothes the next day in the afternoon. I replied that isn't same day. They told me that is what we call it. If I wanted my clothes later that day I need to get express and pay $15 extra fee since I called after 9 AM. After several days of this it became incredibly exhausting and I was grateful to leave. The sole bright spot in the service was the concierge staff who appear to know their jobs and were extremely professional.

The Palazzo had a great deal on expedia, so we were excited as we weren't paying much more than if we had been staying at one of the older hotels like Imperial or Circus Circus. The hotel room (the standard, whatever it's called), is absolutely beautiful. Much larger than I expected with a sunken living room, king bed (not 2 queens, which was nice), and a very large, well-appointed bathroom with a separate bathtub and shower. The tub was filthy though, but when I called down to the front desk they offered to have someone come up and clean it right away, but I instead had them do it the next morning while we were out, and they did. The hotel itself otherwise (including the rest of the room) was very clean, I didn't see room service trays in the hallways sitting out forever like some of the other reviewers did. If it was there when I left, it was always gone when I got back. All of the staff were very friendly, although we had very little interaction with them, except for the concierge desk who booked some of our dinner reservations, at no charge and with very friendly service. With our room, we received $50 of play credit and a few free drinks, which was a nice, unexpected bonus. The location was great. We saw Jersey Boys one night right at the hotel (fabulous show, definitely recommended). Overall a good stay. I wouldn't ever stay there again though, not because it wasn't great, because it was, but rather because there are so many great places on the strip to stay, and we like to try something different every time. But I definitely recommend the Palazzo. Only downside, is that in this huge massive resort (part of/inside of the Venetian), there is no indoor pool, and all of the outdoor pools were shut down for part of our stay due to the wind.

Ate at Dos Caminos (Palazzo) and Bouchon (Venetian) for dinner and both were outstanding on every level.

When I say 'view', we could see the hideous pink building that is Treasure Island and the garishly golden Trump building. That's it really. Hardly an amazing view - not really the hotel's fault though. The suite we chose was a higher grade than the standard suite we took in the Venetian last year, largely due to the complaints seen here on TA about the dilapidated rooms found by guests lately. Our suite was missing two crucial things however - the In-suite Dining menu and the Guest Services directory. Pretty big oversight in my opinion. The suite other than that was lovely. Great TVs and lovely bed. However in our suite there was this fresh air vent which cannot be turned off which is really quite loud. When you're on the 49th floor of a hotel, you don't expect to open the windows, but this thing made me want to suffer the consequences had we the option. Really annoying. I asked housekeeping and they told me it was normal. If it is then I'd warn people to check the noise level before accepting the suite as it kept me awake all night. In-suite Dining at the Palazzo is very expensive. Last year we ordered from the ISD menu at the Venetian. I assume the kitchen is the same - as the ISD menus appear to be identical from what I saw online. The quality of the food has gone down in my opinion however. I ordered a dinner service and breakfast service and while the meals were adequate and plentiful, I did think they didn't quite warrant the high prices. Over $60 for breakfast for 2 people is entirely insane - but this is Vegas. Otherwise the hotel is nice. I do prefer the Palazzo casino to others on the strip. The high ceilings lend a great sense of space to the crowded valleys of betting people. We dined in the restaurant CUT one evening and would recommend everyone does - absolutely fabulous. Other than that we didn't move much toward the pool deck which looked nice from the suite window or anywhere else. The link to the Venetian's 'Shoppes' is nice to walk through, but it seems the quality of shops is lacking - especially when you see that Wynn has Cartier etc and Bellagio has Fendi etc. Not that anyone could afford the contents anyway! My gripe was the cost of the internet - at $9.99 after paying over $600 for 2 nights' stay mid-week, it's a bit rich. Really should be free in this kind of place. Wouldn't be the fastest I've ever used either but it's ok. I like the printer/fax/scanner in the room though - a true gem. But beware that not enough power outlets are available at the desk and some devices will be sacrificed for your needs. Overall it was a pleasant experience. The spacious suite was nice and the meal at CUT certainly repaired any ill feelings toward ISD but it is an expensive ordeal all round. Best advice is to maybe stay in the Venetian for the lesser price and steer clear of the ISD at all costs - even if you're desperate! It's just not worth the money until they sort out the food quality.

Expected to be in a trashed room overlooking the service yard - but what a surprise. Took the Palazzo Shuttle Bus from the Airport which was hastle free. Expected to have to queue for ages for checkin as it was a Saturday afternoon, but had 1 couple ahead of us in the queue. Friendly receptionist chatted and asked if it was our first trip to Las Vegas (it was), told us she had a nice room for us on the 12th floor overlooking Treasure Island and the Strip. I didn't put much pass on what she passed over to me, an envelope and our key cards ...... more to come Ran the gauntlet of the Casino to the lifts, up to the 12th floor and WOW! Although I had seen photo's of the room, nothing could prepare me for the real deal. Many reports indicate the rooms have become \"tired\" - guess we were lucky - ours was spotlessly clean with no signs of wear and tear apart from a button missing from the sofa. The views of the strip with the backdrop of the mountains was impressive. The bathroom: Lets just say - if I ever get the opportunity to plan my dream bath/wash room - this was it. The nicest bathroom I have ever been in. Loved the mood lighting and the separate toilet, but couldn't just get where the TV was situated on the wall - a case of all sound and no picture. Would have neck injury if you were relaxing in the bath watching tv. I could have happily lived in the bathroom for the duration of my visit. Good selection of toiletries and little extras, plus a good selection of fluffy towels (the biggest bath towels ever), robes etc etc Two double beds in the sleeping area, wonderfully comfortable with luxurious linen and pillows, the decor was fantastic. We had fun trying out our electric curtains and our three tv's. The relaxing area in the room too was very comfortable with surprisingly comfy sofas (they didn't look so initially). Although we didn't avail of room service, the dining table would be welcommed for those who would, the writing/work area with WIFI was great and the dvd player/radio etc were all home away from home if you didn't want to venture out. Had ringside seats for the Firework display at TI, opened the drapes and the two of us sat, wine in hand to enjoy. All of a sudden (after about 20 minutes) - Plop and that was it!! Recession must be hitting pyrotechnic technicians in Las Vegas! How we laughed at sitting (me in my lovely huge bath towel) when there was so much more we could have been doing in Las Vegas! Aircon: was quiet and did it's job. No problems. OK - The Envelope: A (I presume) standard letter welcoming us to the hotel coupled with a $45 slot credit, voucher for 20% discount in restaurants and 2-for-1 cocktail vouchers. Looked like our initial payment of $480 would become a real bargain. Concierge: We sought guidance from one of the Concierge regarding visiting the Grand Canyon, she spent ages with us and offered several suggestions. Nothing was a problem and she was one of the friendliest, helpful concierge we have encountered. She was so good we tipped her twice, the second time she was reluctant to take it. Her suggestion of the Pink Jeep Tour was spot on, jeep ride out, helicopter to the canyon floor and boat up the Colorado. I didn't particularly fancy a heli ride from Las Vegas. Would highly recommend this tour to anyone. Security: Security Officers at elevators seemed to take notice of comings and goings. We were chatting passing through one of the evenings and forgot to flash our keycards, and he stopped us. Good thing. Although there appeared to be a lot of bodies around for conferences, there was never a delay waiting on an elevator Restaurants: Of course we availed of our 20% Discounts - ate at Dos Caminos (fab), Woo (fab too), Cafe Lux (good too for homecooked fare but far far too much food), Table 10 (possibly the 2nd worst meal we ate on our 3 destination trip - awful food, service, atmosphere) tried to get table in Carnevino a couple of times but were lucked out and we wanted the flexibility of not having to book and thats why we settled on Table 10. Casino: I am not a gambler - well I wasnt until I went to Las Vegas but stuck gold on a Lucky Leprechaun machine, which I only played because I'm Irish ;-) Won enough on my 3rd spin to play over the 4 nights, won some/lost some and had my money doubled on checking out. All joking aside, the Casino was never full (far from it) and drinks were hard to come by.We had better service on the Sunday afternoon in the MGM playing the cent slots!! In saying that, one of the evenings when it was extremely quiet, my husband tipped the waitress $10 as he had nothing smaller and she practically sat on our coat tails all evening ensuring we were ok for drinks. Don't drink much so she didn't get much custom (or tips) from us. Hubbie played a card table one of the nights and the guy sitting beside him got up and walked out, saying he wasn't prepared to play and not be offered a drink after sitting in on a game for 45 minutes. Looks like the recession is hitting the cocktail waitresses too. Someone told us that they have only 4 on to cover the casino in the evenings. Pool Area: Looked beautiful and wasn't too busy whilst we were there. However my lovely pale Irish complexion didn't lend itself to the searing heat and sitting outside. Running the gauntlet from Hotel to Hotel (or Shop to Shop) was just about all I could manage! The Scent: I have read previously about the scent in the hotel. Didn't find it a problem, but once we crossed the threshold into the Venetian I almost gagged and had to leave. What a strong, artificial smell - what are they trying to cover up? As a result, I spent little or no time exploring around the Venetian. The Fashion Show Mall: Can be accessed by taking escalators over the strip via the Encore/Wynn. Wasn't that impressed with the shopping (spent a couple of hours one of the days). Everything in Las Vegas seems to be 2 extremes - either high end or trashy trash. Checkout: Checked out via the TV and had no hastle or hidden charges and leaving the hotel around 8.30am for a 11.35am flight. Reluctant to leave, but so glad we did when we did. Stood in queue at the hotel taxi pickup for over 35 minutes for taxi. Couldn't understand how it was so disorganised and people around us were getting irrate as they were running late for meetings/flights etc. In the end, we offered a ride to a gentleman behind us in the queue to the airport as the bellboy was sending taxi's off to the airport with one passenger per car. Another few in the queue started to do the same too and share cabs. We visited most of the other hotels on the strip over the few days we were there. If I were to return, I wouldn't mind trying out the Wynne/Encore. However for what we paid, and for what we got - I don't think we could beat the Palazzo and I would be more than happy to return.

Not sure why you would want to or need to upgrade to a bigger suit because like I said this was really very nice. The bathroom is big and bright and can easily be shared with another while getting ready. The beds are very comfy. All the staff members in the hotel were extremely polite and wanted to make sure your stay in every way was enjoyable. We had room service breakfast delivered one morning and although a bit pricey for breakfast $43.00 not including tip it was good and again the delivery was right on time and the bellman was nice, polite and very accommodating! The only gambling I did at the Palazzo was in the sports bar and the employees there were also great. They helped me make a couple of bets that I was not 100% sure of and they made me feel great. Overall I would recommend this hotel if you were looking for a high-end place to stay in Vegas. None of the staff were stuffy or arrogant and made you feel welcome and good. I may not stay again just because of price alone, (I think you can find a decent room elsewhere for a bit cheaper) but if they were to send me a slight discount for rooms in the future I would consider staying again.", "Date": "October 12, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Mesa, AZ", "Title": "\u201cBest hotels ever\u201d", "Author": "tly", "ReviewID": "UR46670339", "Content": "We got our rooms comped, so the price was right, but definitely our favorite place to stay on the strip.

Our transport from airport to hotel took 30minutes. The ride down the strip and up to the hotel was impressive - and with a soundtrack of 1970s hits pumping out of the speakers - a great start to the six night trip. We were greeted by a uniformed doorman and directed to check-in - it only took a few minutes - all the paperwork had been carefully prepared. We recevied a suite on the 38th floor, non-smoking and with a view over the strip - The Venetian .The Mirage , Trump Towers and Treasure Island all surrounded by the mountains - sunsets were amazing. There are plenty of elevators servicing the floor - they all rise at the speed of Saturn 5 rocket. Our suite, 38800 was fantastic - two queen sized very comfortable beds , It was all spotlessly clean and very quite. We never heard any noise , once I had blocked out the sound of the air conditing from my head , not something one normally has to deal with in north east Scotland. there were three televisions in the suite - On the wall across from the bed was a big (42\u201d )flat-screen TV a smaller TV in the bathroom - onl;y complaint it was difficult to watch when fully reclined in the bath surrounded by bubblebath - the third in the lower level of the suite opposite a couple of double leather couches had a DVD player connected. A CD player/clock radio was by the bed. More drawers and closet space than in our entire house. Under the TV was a mini bar, which we did not touch - you can look but you better not touch - unless you want it added to the bill - there is a safe, which we did use . There were four remotes - one for each TV plus a remote for the blinds and very thick ( Neon Proof)curtains. The view was fantastic , ever changing ..... The bathroom was comfortable, a tranparently enclosed shower with a seperate big bath, two sinks and a dressing table with hairdriers and enough mirrors to cover every angle - soaps , shampoos and lotions aplenty. The towels were thick , large and many - robes for two ($65 each to buy) were also hanging in the bathroom - no slippers though . The loo was seperate and did the job, wife impressed with the wallpaper unusual in hotel rooms!. We liked the Palazzo\u2019s casino although our gambling was for fun and at the lower price range - the highlight was my wife winning a total of $75 on the penny slots over the six days. We did not eat breakfast formally - tea and pastries from the Casino Floor Coffee Bean Shop hit the spot most days - apart from one 'formal ' dinner at First resturant - which I thought was overpriced and rather overspiced and a great disappointment - we visited a wide variety of eateries across the city - I do not eat many burgers during a normal year but if you fancy one try the Burger Bar at the Flamingo - a Traditional American with Cheese and a Bud hits that urge. I checked-out via the TV after booking for a late departure - simple task - you can pick up a copy of your bill at the checkout desk - it takes three minutes. Be aware that there is an additional cost/tax of $17 per day which is added to your account _ late check out was $50 plus tax. ( 1400 rather than 1100) We really had a fine time at The Palazzo. It is an experience - if you visit Vegas and you want a little extra comfort where you can relax for a few hours every day and recharge for the next day go the Palazzo.", "Date": "October 11, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Los Angeles", "Title": "\u201cConcierge Suites well worth it IF you drink, are rich or want to feel spoiled!\u201d", "Author": "MarquisMark22", "ReviewID": "UR46422975", "Content": "We stayed in a Concierge Fortuna Suite. It would have been $100 less if not for the concierge treatment. So what do you get for your $100?

You can just get one meal a day and snack here the rest of the time and you'll be fine. Unless you're really a light eater or on a budget and then you could probably subsist on what they give you - although it would be heavy on fats and sugars. On top of the food, you get access to the lounge which is on the 23rd floor, private check in and the Royal treatment. The people that work the concierge level are awesome. They are obviously well trained in ammners and psychology, they are friendly, but not familiar and completely non-judgemental even if you're dressed like a slob. A lot customers there just seemd like regular folks indulging themselves for a specail treat, which this place certainly is. The drinks were awesome with premiun liquor. We ordered Mojitos, Mai Tais, Long Island iced teas, etc. If you weren't a drinker would the extra $100 be worth it. Probably not. But if there are two of you and you each have a few drinks (or more) then you can easily justify the added expense. On top of that, it was just plain nice to be treated so well and to avoid the long check in lines, etc. Oh yeah, and the room was great, too! We paid a little over three bills on a Sunday night and it included some nice promo stuff including a slot credit on which we almost won back the room! 8 pools to choose from but none of them are more than 4 feet deep, so if you're really into swimming you might think about that. Other than that, it's a beautiful place. At the price we paid we felt this was a good value. If you pay less, you will probably think it's a great value. More and you might not.

First things first, there are loads of plusses about this hotel. It's rooms are superbly comfortable and spacious, it's location is excellent for the heart of the Vegas experience and it has very pleasant - if not class leading - pool and casino areas. The common parts of the hotel are vast and beautifully done in a sumptious if cavernous sort of way. There is an issue for me that when you think about it you're really staying in an opullent shopping mall with vast high ceilings. A waterfall is a waterfall until it's really just a backdrop for an escalator area! Having said that, this is Vegas and that's the predominant hotel architecture but there are subtler and more intimate options, namely next door at the Wynn and Encore. In fact, the shops here are less 'mall like' than those at the neighbouring Venetian with a perfectly pleasant range of very high end boutiques on the floor above casino level. A smattering of coffee stops with snacks were most welcome but I'd suggest the short walk through the casino to the 'illy' franchise by the aforementioned escalator fountain for an excellent range of coffees and breakfast snacks rather than the tiny store by the guest escalators that everyone seemed drawn to. The illy also had a great selection of ice creams, pancakes and sandwiches at all times of the day. The casino is tiny by Vegas standards but has everything you'd want really. Typically higher limits in the evenings on table games starting at $15 minimum. The rooms are exceptional. Very comfortable beds and large sofa area with panaoramic windows and remote control drapes. Bathrooms are also good but why would you have a TV in a location where you can't see it from the bath, unless you take the tap/faucet end!? A word on the upgrade thing. I didn't feel overly comfortable with the advance tip ('trick') being British but also as we were two couples checking into two rooms so do you go $40 and if nothing comes of it that's a big 'thank you' note, or stick with $20 and be considered cheap. Either way, I just asked nicely for a high floor strip view having e mailed some days prior and they were perfectly happy to find us something - even though the reply to the e mail had been to say 'yes of course, that'll be $30 per night per room extra though'. I handed over a $20 as a thank you but would have gone much larger if an upgraded suite had been found for us! Location of the hotel is great. Right across from the Fashion Show Mall for everyday shoppers and essential for a good liquor supply in ABC stores. Note that a gift shop by the lifts in the hotel has a small amount of stock, 'salty snax' and a few bottles of booze but a bottle of JD at the ABC was a good $8 cheaper. Next door is the Wynn which I regret not spending more time in. We just strolled through one morning but I'd had grand plans to drink and dine there which never came off. The Palazzo lobbies are attached to the Venetian shops and its kitsch canal and just over the road is the TI, then down to the Mirage and Ceasars etc etc. My only real reservation about the hotel are the restaurant and drinking options. I won't know if it's just me as so many others say good things about them but I just don't really get the whole thing about eating in a restaurant - a not cheap one I might add - which is really just a section in the corner of the casino or mall. Take the Grand Lux for example. The 'outside' area is just separated from the slots by a crash barrier type set up. The Helix wine bar is a collection of seats in the apex of the walkways between shops. It had the feel of a shopping mall Starbucks at best yet is heralded as a mecca for wine buffs. Sushisamba is undeniably a casual open area at the top of an escalator. None of these manages to take you anywhere other than.... the corner of a mall or casino. First Food and Bar, which we liked on our first night despite the jet lag, was better as it was properly enclosed along a walkway area on the way to the Venetian. So, sadly, my abiding memory of the Palazzo is more about the disapointment of its failure to light up our evenings despite us spending good money in supposedly well regarded restaurants. Similar comments to be honest about Strip Steak at the Mandalay Bay (beautiful but so expensive steak) although the Eifel Tower restaurant at the Paris did succeed in feeling like a dining destination rather than a stop off on an airport concourse. I think that's the point I'm making. These places feel like high end burger joints in a multiplex rather than destinations. When I pay $50 for a steak I'd like to feel that I've arrived somewhere worthwhile rather than just grabbing a bite on the way through. Back to the hotel. The pool area was very good and far nicer than the Venetian's. A number of classical style pools, two quite large, plus smaller pools and large spa areas. One reservation though. Whilst prices for drinks were exhorbitant everywhere there's something specially galling about being charged top dollar ($14 of them in fact) for a medium sized plastic cup full of weak lemony liquid masquerading as a Jack and sour! Do what we did. By hook or by crook get the contents of your $24 bottle of Jack (ABC Stores) pool side with a few cans of mixer and save yourself approximately $300 in the process. I don't mind paying high end prices for high end drinks. That's Vegas.

The room was fabulous - wonderful bathroom, great view across the strip, no less than 3 flat-screen TV's in the room including one in the bathroom! There is a safe in the room but no fridge (costs an additional $25 per day for a fridge - or you can use the ice machine and fill up one of the sinks to cool your beer/fizz!) although there is an electronic mini-bar. Parking is in the basement and this is free if you're driving your own rental car. There is also valet parking and this is of course chargeable. An escalator from the car park brings you straight in to the casino / lobby area of the hotel. There are a large number of shops and restaurants in the hotel and also in the adjacent and attached Venetian hotel. Cost of restaurants is high as you'd expect. Shops are all high-end, no high street labels here! There are two outlet malls in LV - both nearby but you will need a car / taxi. It's worth joining the Club Grazie programme when you check in, or do it in advance online - you'll get $15 to play with on the slot machines/tables - it's a reward type programme that allows you to get additional benefits, the more you use it, the more benefits you'll get! Room service: we used it on one night (after a v. long drive to the Grand Canyon and back!) - food is okay, but the charge for delivery is high and 2 days later when we checked out, the plates had still not been removed despite our request.

At check in, the woman behind the desk offered us a suite at Palazzo, which she promised would have a view plus an extra 100 square feet, at an extra cost of $39 per night. I had gotten such a fabulous rate for the Venetian (literally half the average), we agreed to the upgrade. We did not regret it. In fact, I don't think we'll ever stay at another hotel in Vegas. Ever. Even if we have to pay the regular room rate. The Palazzo is opulent without being ostentatious (by Vegas standards!), and the rooms are sumptuous, comfy, and large. We were obssessed with our room and could not get over the view. We could see mountains in the distance, down the strip all the way to Ceasars (to Trump on the other side), and directly below us the Palazzo's gorgeous pools. The attention to good design and comfort in a Palazzo suite is beyond compare- from the enormous marble bath to the soft couch and ottoman in the sitting area. We never experienced the lack of attentive service which other reviewers have complained of, and found that the Venetian/ Palazzo staff were nothing but professional and accomodating. Our room was made up in a little over an hour (we were three hours early for check in), and our bags brought over from the Venetian and up to our room in about a half hour. The girl at the front desk of the Palazzo even called to apologize for making us wait for our bags. We felt that, in a hotel with 3,000 rooms, the wait times were quite reasonable, and courteous service forgives whatever minimal inconvenience they may have caused. We enjoyed the casino. It was, as I believe another reviewer descibed it, a bit \"more mature\" than others on the strip, but great after an evening out on the town when we just wanted to be close to our room but weren't ready to be IN our room. We're a young couple, but we're more into long dinners (sit outside at Bouchon in the Venezia tower and order a great wine- guaranteed perfect evening) and cocktails than clubbing, so when Lavo nightclub let out on Friday, the crowd in the casino was a mess and kind of ruined our vibe. I'm sure that Lavo is the place to be in Vegas if you like clubbing, though. I didn't see a single unattractive person walk into or out of that place. The shopping at Palazzo is on scale with New York and Rodeo Drive. Bring your credit cards.

It has a seperate living area that you go down a couple of steps to, so you can relax and watch one of the three tvs. The massive window has remote control blinds and curtains and the beautiful bathroom also has a dressing table and a tv to watch while in the tub. We did, however get the smell of cannibis coming through the air vents in our bathroom for a couple of days from a room either above or at the side of us...but we slept well for those two days! The pool areas are lovely, but be warned, the main pool does not get sun until 1.30pm. You can however, walk around to the venetian pools where you will get the sun earlier. It was a very busy time in vegas while we were there, the busiest we have ever seen it, which was surprising, it being well into september. very busy around the pool here at the weekends. To truly appreciate this hotel, you need to go with a bottomless pit of money to spend, not being on a holiday budget like most normal people. This hotel is used for conferences and business meetings, some of which are conducted over breakfast while you are sat eating on the next table, which I didnt like much. I think business meetings should be somewhere private, not over your eggs and bacon. The Grand Lux restaurant here is fab, with a huge selection on the menu and huge portions to match!! There were a few times, when I could not move after trying to eat my dinner and still leaving a normal sized amount still on my plate! The security is good here and no-one gets anywhere near the lift areas to the rooms without showing their room key.

Right after dinner, I had bouts of diarrhea, stomach pains, and felt a bit warm that night. The following day, I requested that a paramedic come up to see me in our suite. A Security E.M.T., Ms. Jeanee Martins, came to see me at 3:00 p.m. She took my blood pressure, asked me a couple of questions about the food that I had, and then completed and signed a report for her. For your information, when my husband completed the \"check-out process\" on Saturday morning, he noticed that despite the fact that I got sick from the \"Beef Stir Fry\" in-suite item which we ordered from their \"In-Suite Menu\", and which the Managers themselves were well aware of, we were still charged for said item! The other unfortunate incident that happened also with The Palazzo Resort Hotel Casino was the fact that the other part of our WestJet Vacations Package called, \"Added Value\", was not presented to us upon check in. All they were interested in was finding out from us if we were willing to upgrade our stay for $100.00/day for all the five (5) days, i.e., $500.00, in total. As you may have already guessed, we rejected the offer. (Can you just imagine if we had accepted the offer, and then suffer from the \"ill-fated Beef Stir Fry\" to boot?!) The lesson, we think, that we've derived from this particular vacation, is two-fold: 1) Stay away from \"packages\", in this case it was a \"WestJet Package\", and 2) Don't be \"swayed\" by hotel ratings, that is, just because \"The Palazzo\" is a 5-star hotel, it doesn't mean that ALL of its suites are totally nice and in good order, \"tested safe and good food\", (the irony of it is that this hotel is supposedly owned by Wolfgang Puck, a famous Chef?!), \"customer-friendly\" hotel. Believe me, the genuinely good ?-star hotels that we've experienced in the past have survived the \"test of time\". Bellagio, Caesar's, The Mirage, Wynn, to name a few, would still rank as our most favorite hotels in Las Vegas. In particular, the \"customer relations/satisfaction\" that we received from the Bellagio Hotel in their \"food department\" is unforgettable, as it was truly a superb dining experience, throughout! All of my friends and relatives (and their friends and relatives) will be very pleased to stay out (never mind the In-Suite Menu) of The Palazzo in Vegas. P.S. I just talked to my girlfriend this morning who stayed with her husband at the Palazzo (about 3 weeks before we did), BUT booked her suite directly with the Palazzo Hotel, and was NOT part of this WestJet package. I found out that she and her husband were provided with SLIPPERS in their suite, plus, the furniture was in good order, UNLIKE in our suite, there were NO slippers; one handle was missing from one of the chest of drawers - and toward the middle of the week, another handle fell off when I tried to open one of the drawers; the lamp switch on my side of the bed will not turn off, therefore I just had to plug and unplug the cord in order to use it; the soap holder in the washroom was sitting \"lopsided\" on the sink because one of its \"legs\" was missing.

We instead had a view of the mountains and the fashion mall, as well as the Pirate hotel (I think its name is Treasure Island) and the Wynn resort. We paid over $400 per night for 2 nights while at a convention. We stay in a lot of nice places, and I must say that this suite truly lived up to our expectations, even though we weren't facing the strip. The pit living area was very comfortable, which was great for me since I have NO IDEA how to gamble and don't care to learn. I was able to watch college football in a really opulent room! The linens were gorgeous, and the bathroom spacious and beautiful, complete with a sit-down vanity. We saw the musical Jersey Boys and it was fantastic. Even my skeptical husband loved it! Room service was timely and tasty. Of course it was expensive! The restaurant selection astounded us! Dos Caminos was incredibly tasty for lunch. We ate in the lounge area (no reservation) at Cut by Wolfgang Puck, and that was our favorite dining experience. We also tried Restaurant Charlie by Charlie Trotter. It wasn't our favorite cuisine, although the service was very good. At any fine restaurant you visit, expect a dining experience. They will not rush you. They expect you to dine for hours, therefore service may seem slower than normal. Ample shopping abounds. I am not really the type to buy the $2000 Dior bag, so I really didn't partake.

They included two-for-one tickets to see Phantom, a $25 slot credit, two-for-one Madame Tusaud's Wax Museum (much better that expected!)and $30 off dinner at WOO and some other stuff. When we got there we upgraded to the Concierge Level (more on that later) for $100 more per night and to a bigger 950 sq ft Fortuna Suite for $75 more per night. Heck, I just got out of the hospital, it was my birthday and we wanted to splurge. I don't want to dwell on the good stuff becuase I know you want to know about everything that went wrong, which was not much, The hotel was simply beautiful and well laid out. The valet parking and luggage handilng is free. We saw several tacky people wheeling their luggage through the casino. Just use the free services and don't make yourself look like a redneck. This is a 5-star hotel. Act like you belong there people! The room was incredible with an all marble bathroom that you could have hosted a ball in. Huge walk-in closet, remote controlled drapes and air conditioning, DVD player, three HD wide screen TVs (even one in the bath), three telephones (even one in the separate toilet room... who speakes on the phone while on the pot?). The room was extremely quiet. We could hear no outside noise when in the room. The service by the staff was impecable with everyone always saying hello to you. I particulatly like, because this is a 50-story hotel that overshadows all the others, they have a 4 different banks of elevators, each dedicated to a different scection of floors, so you don't have to stop at every floor to pickup and drop off people or wait long from one to come by. They are FAST too. I've never seen a bigger pool area at a hotel. There are 7 pools plus jacuzzis in semi-private little nooks, so we never had to fight for a place to lounge. Warning: There is very little shade which seems to be a big drawback in the 100-plus-degree desert sun. I think they want you to rent one of their many poolside cabanas if you want shade. The concierge level gets you a private checkin area, someone to ask questions to and make reservations for you at all times, access to a private pool area called AZURE Thur-Sunday, access to a DVD library, free soft drinks, water, lemonade and great fresh-baked chocolate-chip cookies all day, free continental breakfast with hot oatmeal and one hot item, a snacktime, an evening open bar and appetizers time and an evening dessert time all on the 23rd floor with a spectacular view. There are 4 rooms of livingroom type seating to enjoy here so there is plenty of room, just a lot of jockying for the window seats. So now for the bad stuff... I did not feel the concierge level was worth $100 extra per day. The hot item for breakfast was rotated every 4-days and always seemed like it had been sitting there a long time getting crusty. There were blintzes one day, mini quiches another. At night there were mostly cold appitizers and an always empty hot appitizer chafing dish, There were never enough and when they would put a tray out it was like a cattle call with peolple rushing to beat everyone else to get some. Then there were the rude people would not just take one or two knowing that there weren't enough to go around, but fill their plates. Don't forget the people who bring their 5 kids and pretend that this is free dinner. That's not what this is about people! Show some class. Some parents thought this was the unsupervised playground area for their kids too. However, a waiter would bring you any drink you wanted and as much as you want. That was nice. A complaint I had about the beautiful pool was the music. We arrived too early on a Sunday to get in our room right away so they suggested we go to the pool and wait. There was loud \"thump-thump\" music everywhere at the pool. They had speakers strategically placed in the landscaping every few feet and no designated quiet areas. Can you tell me why, in this age of personal music devices like iPods and headphones, why they need to play loud music? I asked several staff members where to go if you wanted a nice quiet area to read while sunning yourself and they said there was no way to get away from the music. I asked several questions like, \"who decided on what music to play?\" and \"who decides on the volume?\" and none of the pool staff could answer. I asked to speak to the manager about it and they said the pool manager \"Ms. Ivy\" was off until Tuesday. This was very frustrating and the only time I saw a lack of staff helpfullness. We also tried going to the private \"fee\" pool AZURE but found that although we had \"free access\" you were required to purchase at least $25 per person in food and drink if you wanted to sit down. Huh? The area seemed crowded with very young adults and the music was even louder in there (they had their own DJ) so we did not stay. The pool wait staff was very attentive, abundant and fast, however my wife ordered a small pina colada, which came in a plastic cup and charged $13, which I though was a little steep.

I asked to speak to a manager or supervisor and was told that there was nobody on duty (which I find hard to believe at a little after 5pm in the Concierge Lounge of a Las Vegas hotel...) but I was asked if I wanted the manager to call me the following day I said I definitely wanted the call..but received no call over a three night stay The room was finally cleaned within acceptable standards (but not great) Turndown service only occurred once over a three night stay Upon checkout, I requested the direct email address of the manager and was given an illegible note which I had to ask for clarification of three times and eventually had to rewrite myself... When I sent the email to complain, it came back as 'undeliverable' which leads me to believe that I was given incorrect information I then sent an email to the link connected to the third party 'survey' that the hotel sends out after checkout and got connected with a very helpful customer service rep who offerred a complimentary night in a Concierge Level Suite. This went a long way in restoring my faith in the Palazzo's customer service, BUT...when the certificate arrived in the mail, it was only for a regular room! (That is a difference of $100). I had to email again and point out the 'mistake' in order for it to be corrected. I did receive the correct certificate, but it surely shoudn't have taken so long . The only positive thing I can say about the stay at the Palazzo is that the bathroom was lovely! Customer service and cleanliness of the room was unacceptable for a hotel at that price range.

My wife was bit apprehensive about seeing a number of reviews commenting on cleanliness of the rooms, but happy to say we had no issues whatsoever, in or outside the room. ROOM : Lots of room in the suite, enjoyed the seperate and sunken sitting area with plush and spacious sectional. Furniture, fixtures and accents were were wonderful. The king size bed was very comfy, bathroom spacious as well. Only complaint was lack of shower pressure for late morning showers (was much better later in the day). I guess everyone sleeps in and takes late showers at same time. The room allowed us to easily and comfortably entertain guests in our room for pre show cocktails. So much better than standard rooms where everyone is squeezed in and around a little table or on edge of bed. CHECK IN: was without issue, quick and easy. Check out as well. POOL: quite nice, busy, but Vegas during the day is all about hanging out at the pool in the heat with drink in hand and nice sights to see. We enjoyed the pool's energy. FOOD: Being late risers who still like a good breakfast, we were very happy with food, service and atmosphere of the morning buffett in the Grand Lux restaurant. For dinner, Delmonico Steakhouse (Venetian), Palm (Caesar's) and Mon Ami Gabi (Paris) all served up outstanding meals, and service was fantastic, most notably at Delmonico. SHOWS: Love at the Mirage was a disappointment. While we enjoyed it, our whole group found it was more dancing and costumes then the usual acrobatics we are accustomed to from C du Sol. Le Reve at the Wynn provided more of the latter, some amazing feats and the theatre was quite impressive. Peepshow with Holly Madison was surprisingly entertaining. My wife and I enjoyed it, quite funny, some catchy tunes, good dancing, and of course some beautiful and scantily clad women are always a bonus. We were actually upgraded to VIP front row table seats, but in the end, would have preferred to be a bit further back as we found the tables were too close to the stage -- had to continously swivel around completely in our chairs when the show progressed out to any one of the three catwalks, as well as having to look almost straight up in a few instances. But will admit, being that close gave some great views as well. :) OUTINGS: Just a drive out to Hoover Dam this time round, amazing structure. Recommend not stopping in the little town to park, and instead drive right out to the Dam. We did a quick outside tour before taking the guided tour, which we enjoyed. GAMBLING : not our bag, but the tables were packed over the weekend nights and smoke was not too much of an issue when passing through, unlike some of the casinos with lower ceilings. SHOPPING: can't say enough about the Premium Outlet Mall, about a $15 cab ride each way from Strip. Being one who hates shopping, the prices were outstanding (clothes, shoes, accessories). So much so, I hardly noticed we were at it for almost 5 hours. GOLF: didn't partake this time as temps were over 105 F (40+ Celsius), and just too hot to play. Ran into others who had wished they didn't because of heat. We could see Wynn GC from our suite. Looked quite nice, but believe saw less than 10 groups on the course our entire stay.

We had some minor things that were rectified immediately. There was a burned out light bulb in the toilet and one room didn't have robes, but they fixed both issues immediately. My aunt requested an empty fridge and that was also brought up to the room immediately. The all-suite hotel was very spacious and handy for our family since we were able to entertain all six people in the living room area at any given time. Unlike other strip hotels, it was pretty easy to get from the lobby to the room. Usually you have to navigate through the casino maze to find the elevators to your room. Initially, one person wondered where the toilet was while standing in the middle of the bathroom because it actually had it's own room. There were two extra jets in the shower, which was separate from the tub. Also, there were double sinks in the bathrooms. There are three flat screen tvs: in the sunken living room, in front of the bed, and in the bathroom. We liked the Agraria lemov verbena toiletries that were provided: shampoo, conditioner, bath salts, shower gel, lotion, soap, and a separate travel box that had a sewing kit, q-tips, hair tie, and cotton. We were also happy with the dining choices at both the Palazzo as well as the Venetian. We really enjoyed a few breakfasts at Canyon Grill. Everything was healthy, delicious, and plentiful. We also had a nice breakfast at Bouchon in the Venetian. We had some wonderful lunches and dinners at Noodle Asia, Sushi Samba, Dos Caminos, Grand Lux Cafe, Postrio, and best of all - Restaurant Charlie. We read plenty of mixed reviews here but we found the service to be outstanding during our stay. My mom used one of the hotel's complimentary wheelchairs so we asked one of the security guards where to get the elevator to go to Sushi Samba. Not only did he show us where the elevator was, he escorted us all the way to the restaurant and even gave us a few of his recommended dishes. Every single time we called one of the hotel's departments from our room, they always addressed us by name. The hotel was accommodating with our different arrival times and even accommodated two of us with early check-in since the rooms were cleaned and available. We requested adjoining rooms, and the Palazzo also granted that request. It was very convenient to walk to the Venetian or in the other direction toward the Wynn and Encore. There is also a walkway that takes you the Fashion Show Mall across the street, where you can look for half priced tickets. The last night of our stay, the slots were surprisingly pretty loose. I won about $150 that evening on pennies, nickels and quarter slots. Not a big jackpot, but it was still a win. I can't wait to return to the Palazzo.

We don't care to stay on the strip but we needed a centrally located \"base\" for each of us to do various things (hike Red Rock Canyon, golf, see a show, shop a little, try famous chef's restaurants, etc) and with a 750 sq foot room, we could have that \"base\" and still share one room. I assume the low room rate of $179 was in part because of the current economy so that was another reason for staying here. That having been said, this hotel is like many others in LV: really nice but larger than life; busy and impersonal. The room decor was obviously Italian but having been to Italy a few times, this was a bit more gaudy than what you would find there. It was still a nice, comfortable room with 2 double beds and a full size sofa sleeper. From our room, the huge windows afforded some great views of the surrounding mountains and a bit of the strip. There are many restaurants within the Palazzo \"complex\" but, of course, you often have to go through the casino and into a \"mall\" atmosphere to find them. We tried Emeril's \"'Table 10\" which overlooked \"the mall\". The food was pretty good (although I preferred his \"New Orleans Fish House\" at the MGM) but the music in the restaurant competed with the \"mall music\". Service there was great. We like to eat healthy foods so we also tried - and enjoyed - the Canyon Ranch Grill. The atmosphere is nothing special but it was nice to be able to have healthy options within the hotel. Service there was average. We also tried the Wolfgang Puck restaurant \"Solaro\" for breakfast. Solaro is adjacent to the pools. Although a lovely place, our server was simply far more interested in the hostess than in serving us. After watching him chat her up several times rather than refill coffee, bring the iced tea we ordered, etc.; we finally enlisted the help of the busboy who we ended up tipping since he seemed much more interested in his job. Regarding the pools; there were several to choose from at The Palazzo but if you wanted sun anytime before noon - there was only 1 pool which became crowded quickly. If you didn't want sun AFTER noon, you were definitely out of luck at the \"main pool\" as I saw no umbrellas whatsoever. In the LV summer heat, it would have been nice to have a shady option so we could enjoy it water without sustaining heat stroke. There was also no pool food service that we saw although they did come by with cool wet towels and cucumber slices. (I suppose you could bring your own \"Hidden Valley Ranch\" and eat those.) I also never understand why the pools don't stay open late in LV. After a day at a convention or even an oppressively hot day, it would be lovely to be able to relax by the pool but we've found that most LV pools close early - many by 8 and some even at 5! Our major complaint with The Palazzo was, despite the \"Do Not Disturb\" sign on the door, we were still startled awake with the sounds of a shrill \"HOUSEKEEPING\" during the 9 o'clock hour - 2 days in a row. The 3rd day, we handwrote a note telling them to not bother us until 11am. On day 2, I spoke to housekeeping and told them when we'd be out of the room so they could clean and they smiled and said they'd be back but we never saw them again and our room was never touched that day. One more thing to point out is that you CANNOT call ahead for your car if you used valet parking. You must go downstairs, hand them the ticket and then wait. Although the valet attendants were doing the best they could, self parking was much easier there than going through this. All in all, we felt this was a typical experience at a large hotel in Vegas. In hindsight, we much preferred the quiet of the Signature at MGM but we were glad we tried The Palazzo because of the room size and convenient location to other attractions on the strip. In spite of the problems there, it's still a grand place with a lot to offer. I couldn't list this as merely an average hotel because it's massive and has dozens of amenities. If you love the whole \"Vegas way\" though, you will probably love this hotel.

We requested a non-smoking room on a non-smoking floor. To our dismay we received a non-smoking room that clearly had a chain-smoker bunkered in it for at least a week. Every fabric was emitting the ghastly smell of cigarette smoke...no joke. When it became unbearable, we finally called down to the front desk at about 1:35am and after waiting in the queue for no less than 20 minutes asked to be moved to another suite the next day. No problem with that with the exception that the next room still had a cigarette smoke order -- albeit much fainter -- and the smell of fried food. We never received an apology from the hotel and of course we didn't get any discount for that first night's inconvenience. We had friends stay over at the Palms Place and dare I say that, i) the rooms are FAR nicer, interesting and more luxurious, ii) the pool was much more interesting and actually got sun, and iii) their bill was significantly less expensive. So, all in all, why not save a few bucks and stay at a better place.", "Date": "August 26, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Dallas", "Title": "\u201cThis hotel is very luxurious and I will definitely go back!\u201d", "Author": "PGirl08", "ReviewID": "UR38791702", "Content": "The hotel is very beautiful.

Room was large and well appointed - kids (who are 5 and a toddler) got a kick out of the remote control blinds and curtains, and the general space! Beds were comfortable - one king and one pull out sofa! Room was clean, plenty of towels, three TVs including one in the bathroom which was great for getting the kids to the bath..and the Concierge suits have a library of DVDs you can borrow for free which also helps keeps the kids occupied when its time to get ready! Hotel had a really pretty scent throughout - jasmine and something else I could not identify! But also every now and then we got a rather nasty whiff of sewerage, especially at the pool which was not so pleasant! That was the worst thing about the hotel...but it was not that often and not a big deal! Concierge suits are well worth it if you have kids...breakfast consisted of pastries, fresh fruit, good coffee, juices, bottled water (which you could load up on - great with kids in the hot Vegas summer - bottled water can run you $3 a bottle or more in Vegas so this in itself was great!); and cooked items. The afternoon presentation was simply candy, and scones...but most folks are out and about doing things at this time so we like most, did not bother with this except to grab more water. The evening was hors d'oeuvres---soup, bread, raw veggies and hot / cold snacks and well as soft drinks and alcohol...sparkling wines, beers, premium spirits, cocktails, a great deal!! Service was excellent though tipping helps! Pools were really nice...great for children as they had lengthy areas of shallow water. There were numerous pools and hot tubs and the Azure pool is complimentary Thur - Sun with the Concierge package! There are some great restaurants many of which are child friendly - even the higher end! The Concierge staff are not useful with recommendations however as they suggested Zefferino's to everyone and led us to believe that most places would not be that happy with small kids...Table 10, Morels, and Carnevino were all very child friendly!

Check-in went smoothly, although we had a king bed (came with the special rate of $129) and we wanted to change to two queen beds, of which we had to pay $35 extra per night. And no they wouldn't waive this fee, I tried! So we did end up paying the fee and I realize it was still a great rate. We had a room on the 36th floor, all the way at the end, which was nice and quiet. Our room faced T.I. and The Mirage. Pros: Loved the remote control for the blinds! spacious suite with step down living area. TV in bathroom; phone in \"toliet\" area (no, we didn't use it) Make-up area with light (also broken, but we called and they brought us up a new one) Asked for foam pillows due to an allergy and rec'd them quickly Grand Lux cafe Beautiful decor in room and lobby of hotel Fantastic pedicure from Shelly in the Canyon Ranch Salon. Ask for Shelly! Walgreens/ABC store close for cheap bottled water, souvenirs, etc. HUGE mall, in case you forgot a clothing item Very helpful concierge Cons: Small casino with tight slots no fridge...can request one for $25 a day no umbrellas at pool certain pools closed until Thursday of the week excessive charges for room service! (we ordered milk ONLY and asked for some bowls and spoons since we had leftover cereal from the day prior. The bill was $15: $4.00 for delivery charge, $4.00 for BOWLS!! and 18% service charge and then the price of the milk itself!) In addition, I believe the other review regarding the lack of comps for those who gamble quite a bit. The story: We had noticed water leaking from around the can light in the shower. We called and they sent up maintenance as we were leaving the room. Upon returning, I was showering and stepped on a very sharp screw left there after the can light investigation. Well, quite unhappy at this point and in pain, I called the front desk and spoke to a \"supervisor\" who said he could comp me $50 of our food bill. I asked him if this would be satisfactory to him if he were staying at an upscale hotel. I thought the extra $35 per night for the double bed would be a nice show of apology, however, he did not. I am sure, if I were a \"whale\" I, no doubt, would have been sucked up to rather immediately and efficiently. How sad this is all they could manage to do after this occurrence to a \"non-whale, just wanting a vacation\", guest! 2nd story: Out by pool, obtained two waters from the bar (yes, for free). Go back for another glass a 1/2 hour later, and the bartender leaves and doesn't return for 15 minutes. I ask him for two glasses of water and he is SO rude and states it will be $0.25 for each glass. I'm sorry, what?!! He was so rude that I left and reported it to a waitress walking around taking orders. I asked her if this was policy and she said she had never heard of it before. This isn't some low class resort, this is an upscale place that should NOT be charging $$ for plastic glasses!!! AND, if this is the case, place a sign or tell me the first time I am there asking for some water with the 105 degree heat! Honestly! Although the stories may seem petty to some, I am sure if you were there would have felt a bit slighted at the unsatisfactory outcomes. All in all, it IS a gorgeous resort and the room was perfect.

Since our only child is leaving for college in September, we splurged and got a suite with the concierge service. We are seasoned travelers and overall our experience was a good one. The hotel is only 1.5 yrs old and huge. Our suite was huge (28th floor)...had 3 flat screen TV's including one in the enormous bathroom. Room was very elegant and we were very happy. One issue though is that the furniture was a little dusty---I could write my name on one piece (kinda made me feel at home :) ) Other than that the room was in great condition. Check-in was slow---the attendant was very gracious but it took her almost 15 minutes to check us in. Luckily there was no line to check in ,but I would not have been happy with a wait when we were spending about $325 per night. They charged us $50 per night extra for our son and he could not have signing privileges at the hotel. The lobby is scented--I had read about this--it didn't bother us but it might bother someone with allergies. The concierge floor (23rd) offered breakfast, cookies and beverage mid day, cocktails and hors d'ouevres from 5-7 and evening snacks. The breakfast was quite good---fruits, yogurts, pastries, juices, coffe,tea, a few hot entres, bagels etc. At the cocktail hour, you could have anything you wanted to drink...servers were most pleasant. However, I found the hors d'ouevres lacking----many tasted stale and I expected better variety and presentation. There was always a hot soup available, veggies and dip, some hot appetizers....just nothing too exciting. We never made it to the midday or the later evening presentation. Pool(s) were very nice and staff very nice. You can order take out lunch from the Wolfgang Puck restaurant and eat poolside. Pool bar drinks were expensive but that was not a surprise to us. It was very hot (104) when we were there and pool was warm but refreshing. Jersey Boys plays at the Palazzo theater....we got last minute tickets from the concierge....were eight rows from the front....it was excellent! Highly recommend! We also saw Bette Midler at Caesar's Palace---I am a real fan--we paid A LOT for the tickets but were 12 rows from the front---I loved the show!! We also saw Cris Angel's Believe show at the Luxor--it was okay. Our 18 year old liked it. All in all, we had a great experience. We are not huge gamblers but really wanted to see some shows and have our son experience Las Vegas.

Things I liked: -We ck'ed in early without a problem at all. -We were upgraded without a problem. -We rec'd several coupons for the restaurants which we used. -There were 3 TVs in the room including one in the bathroom. -Superhuge, gorgeous bathroom and spacious room overall with a living room area -Plush bath robes for him and her -Loved the makeup/dressing table in the bathroom. -Room was very quiet, I never heard anyone slamming doors or yelling, etc. -Great view of the pool area and the strip -There was a \"Priority\" button on the phone for a quick answer to anything you wanted. -All the restaurants were insanely good, especially The Grand Lux (we went a cpl times) -Everyone in the casino, hotel, restaurants, shops were SO nice and helpful. -Pools were upscale, nice and relaxing. -Cabana we rented was awesome. Best I have ever been in. Great service here, too. -Went to see Phantom here and it was also awesome. Great show! -There's a Walgreens right out front to hit for cheap supplies. -Super easy check out. Just dropped the key in the box. Things I disliked: -We couldn't get the room as cold as we like it but it was about 90 degrees there then. -The towels could have definitely been softer. They were kind of rough. -One of the drawers in our dresser was busted. -The light on the magnification mirror didn't work. (prob could have asked for another) -They need more HD channels for the wonderful HD/LCD TVs in the room. -The fridge won't hold your own stuff. There's no room. It is filled with their beverages that are pricey. You will be charged as soon as you remove one from it's place. It's electronic. -We were told the fax machine was free but weren't told that there was a charge if it was long-distance. We had a TON of fees upon checkout and they only refunded us half. -The spa is horrible, didn't like it, not relaxing and was like a factory in there.

For almost the same price (with the special the Venetian was running) we stayed in way nicer accomodations with much more to see and do. We hardly left the area of Venetian, Palazzo, the Wynn. Also, the cabanas here were as much as the ones at The Flamingo and way, way better. These cabanas have an AC in them! When you step into The Palazzo you really are taken aback by it's beauty. It is a gorgeous hotel and they have it decorated beautifully. All the restaurants were sleek and modern, too.

I have never composed a review before, but felt that I needed to inform people of our latest stay. I apologise if this comes across as a rant, but for a 5 star hotel, they should be ashamed. We recently stayed at 'The Palazzo' hotel for a ten-day break in Las Vegas; choosing a hotel in Vegas can be quite difficult considering all that is on offer and their locations 'on the strip'. Persuaded by Trip Advisor reviews we decided that the Palazzo looked like a good hotel. The rooms are fantastic; massively opened planned with amazing views of Vegas. The suites are decorated and furnished to a high spec, with remote-controlled blinds and curtains; 3 large LCD TV's in the living area, sleeping area and bathroom. On first impressions the hotel looks amazing, with its opulent and outstanding hotel lobby surrounded with premium designer boutiques and shops (Jimmy Choo/Max Mara/Pink/Mont Blanc etc). The pool area is situated on the third floor and can only be accessed by hotel guests only. Whilst the hotel promotes on its web-site that it has 11 pools \u2013 please be wary, the majority of pools are really small and more of a dipping pool to cool off. There are 3 main pools although Mon \u2013 Thu only one of the main pools is open and it gets really busy with hotel residents virtually sitting on top of each other, which is a great way to meet people I guess!!! The second largest pool is open Thu to Sun and seems to be a favourite with couples and people wanting to escape the hussle and bussle from the main pool. The third pool \u2013 Azure; this is a luxury poolside experience and costs range from $50 - $1000 a day dependant on your location. This is the only child free pool and trust me it is money worth spent, especially at the weekend. Over 21\u2019s only. The pool bar is satisfactory; expect to pay $10 \u2013 20 for a spirit based drink/cocktail. The pool restaurant offers a unique menu by Wolfgang Puck, but to be honest it is rather expensive for what it is and if you don\u2019t mind sharing your meal with pigeons that swoop down on your table and are at your feet whilst eating. The Palazzo has a real issue with pigeons, which they are trying to readdress apparently. We asked whether they proverbially \u2018flew the pigeons in for the Venice effect\u2019. Housekeeping is diabolical! Upon our arrival we started unpacking our clothes and found a pair of spoilt ladies underwear in the wardrobe. The standard of housekeeping varies day to day it was not uncommon to see dirty crockery and glasses outside rooms in the corridor for 24 hours if not longer after someone has ordered room service. On our last day, the housekeeper did not bother with our room and it took over an hour to get fresh towels. After reading the reviews on Trip Advisor the majority of the residents stay for a short break only and I guess it is a fabulous hotel for a weekend, however, I would air caution if staying longer.

When I booked this, I was unsure whether to choose the Venetian or Palazzo since they are in the same family. D\u00e9cor-wise, I prefer the modern elegance of the Palazzo over the classic elegance of the Venetian. The Palazzo seems to have less than Venetian in terms of shops and restaurants, but the suites are incredible in layout and decor. Both hotels are connected so you can go to the shops and restaurants in the Venetian easily. The Palazzo suites are very bright and cheery. Remote control drapery, bathrobes, slippers, and fresh cut flowers in the bathroom are the touches that make the room a luxury. The lemon verbena toiletries are wonderful. There are 3 flat screen TVs in each suite (including one over the sink in the bathroom). On our first day, we happened to be in the room around 4:30 when there was a knock on the door with an offer of extra towels and chocolate. This did not happen on any of the other days so I wonder whether that was just a \u201cwelcome\u201d offer. To be fair, we weren\u2019t in the room at that time on the other days so we don\u2019t know whether it would have happened again. Also, immediately after checking in, I called the front desk to inform them that 3 of the many lights in the suite were burned out. I told them the exact locations of these lights, but the bulbs were never replaced during the whole time we were there. The room was bright enough without these lights, but I am just pointing this out for the inconsistency of service. Housekeeping was fine except for the last day when they neglected to provide us with clean towels after removing the soiled ones. Again, I didn\u2019t need the towels since we still had 2 unused ones. The Venetian/Palazzo is a huge complex--you can spend your entire vacation wandering around exploring it. The Palazzo pool area is elegant and the pool is heated. Although I didn\u2019t spend time at the pool due to the unusually cool weather this time of year, there were people in the pool while I was wearing a fleece jacket. There are so many food establishments here that you can dine on the premises during your entire vacation and not duplicate restaurants.

The towels were frayed and there were holes in the walls of our room and the furniture was nicked and missing hardware. The pros of this hotel are the spacious suites and the three televisions. We have always stayed at the Bellagio and will go back to it because of the outstanding customer service, clean rooms and overall first class accomadations. I just felt that The Palazzo lacked customer service and cleanliness associated with a five star hotel.", "Date": "August 6, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Texas", "Title": "\u201cThe best stay ever in Las Vegas!!!\u201d", "Author": "TexasDiceRoller", "ReviewID": "UR36871736", "Content": "Stay in The Palazzo for the Paul Mitchel hair show.

It helped that we got a great deal paying only $109 a night. For that money I wasnt expecting a great room. I couldnt have been more wrong, right from the start this was a completly first class experience. We were attended to at check in minutes ( unlike our friends in the flamingo who waited 90 minutes ). Then we got a great room on the 39th floor overlooking the Wynn. The room is perfect for a couple, at approx 700ft its large with plenty of space, and all the facilities you could need. The sunken lounge feels separated from the bedroom area and so like a standard suite, but you dont pay suite money that has probably more space than you need. The hotel also seems a little bit better laid out then the Venetian. Some of the complaints I had heard about the hotel just didnt seem to be an issue. House keeping was excellent. The perfume that is present throughout the hotel is a personal issue. I didnt find it offensive or overpowering. My wife noticed it more than I did, but its in the communal areas and if you go to some of the other hotels you notice the stale odor that would normally be there and realise that actually its preferable. The gym has to be paid for, but actually its a lot more than a gym the aquavana spa is really nice and worth the money for the relaxing break from the madness of the strip, its well worth it and a lot more then a mere gym.

We said yes and we got an amazing room with a fab view of the Strip. The room was great three tv's, it looked brand new, and it was huge. I really would recommend the Palazzo because the rooms are massive and because they are all suites it just means you have lots of room to move in. The mini bar and snacks were expensive but they would be in a 5 star hotel! We had room service and it was reasonably priced and it was delivered quickly, there is a service charge included in the price you pay as well. The room was cleaned well every day as well. The hotel is large and with the connection to the Venetian it can get quite confusing but staff are more than willing to help and we didn't have any issues. Our room didn't take long to walk to either. The Fashion Mall is across the street and had a food court which was really good if you dont want to spend lots of money on breakfast and lunch and there is also a smaller, but still good, foodcourt in the shoppes in the Venetian. The hotel isn't positioned in the direct heart of the Strip but again this caused us no problems. It faces the Treasure Island hotel and the monorail is in Harrahs which is like a 5-10min walk and it will take you as far as the MGM Grand. Then you can get another tram from Excalibar to Mandalay Bay if your feeling lazy. We went to see Phamtom and also the Lion King, both of which were excellent - Phamtom was better though!

But... kind of empty (we went there on Thursday maybe that's why) and boring. So we hung out there for a bit and went back to Tao Beach (at Venetian) which is a bit more hyper for our taste. But, once again, Azure is such a work of art! It is perfect for couples and for people who just want to relax, sip on drinks and tan.

A huge bay window overlooking the strip on a high floor with 2 separate areas -- a formal step down sitting room with L shaped plush couch and dining room table and Flat screen TV... a gorgeously appointed King sized bed with Flat screen TV and an amazing bathroom with gigantic tub and a separate glass shower and enclosed toilet area -- oh, and a flat screen TV.

(longer review)\u201d", "Author": "snwgdss", "ReviewID": "UR35035948", "Content": "This was my fourth stay at the Palazzo and every trip has been absolutely amazing. The staff, cleanliness of the hotel, and the upscale adjacent shoppes make this one of my favorite hotels in the world. I have had 3 different room types on these trips, so here's a quick description of each of them; Sienna Suite: A 1300+ sq ft. room that was to die for. This suite had a master bath that was almost as large as a standard room at lesser properties! The seperate enclosed shower area was massive, and the extra jets coming from the wall for the back, legs, and feet were a nice touch. The tub was oversized, easily comfy for two, with whirlpool jets, and a TV within easy viewing area. Of course the main bathroom had a seperate WC as well for privacy. There was also a small half bath in the main room for guests. The walk-in closet in the master bedroom provided more than ample room for my enormous traveling wardrobe as well! There was also a smaller walk-in closet off the main room. This suite consists of a large entertaining area with small dining table, large living area with couches (which pull out into a bed if needed), work desk, and entertainment center. A small sink area could be used to serve drinks from as well when inviting guests back to your room. Off of this main room was a connecting door to the master bedroom. The master bedoom had tons of space, a chaise lounge and chairs by the windows, another entertainment center, and access to the master bath. Everything was tastefully decorated and amazing amounts of space, even for those like myself that tend to be heavy packers! Fortuna Suite: The Fortuna Suite was large and spacious, but did not offer the privacy of the Siena Suite for entertaing guests as it is one large, open room. The living room area was seperate from the bed, in the signature sunken living style of the Venetian, and the bed area was angled to not be 100% open, but don't expect to have somebody sleeping while you have company over with this room! This room had one large bathroom, but no extra jets in the shower or tub. The closet also afforded plenty of space for those that bring plenty of extra clothes when they travel! The sitting area of this room was larger than the standard suite and the couches were definitely more comfortable than a standard suite. Up near the bed area (but not in the sunken living room) there were also chairs, a table and ottoman to relax on (or hold my discarded clothes as I decided what to wear for the day in my case!). Standard Luxury Suite: Though this is their \"standard\" room it is still nothing to scoff at. Similiar in size/layout as the Venetian's rooms, I was still happy with this option as the price points are considerably lower. Sunken living room area, large bathroom with seperate WC, and enough closet space for two made this a wallet-friendly option. I game almost exclusively at the Palazzo/Venetian now as well as the perks for their Club Grazie members are definitely worth their while as well. I saw Phantom last summer at the Venetian and while it wasn't quite my thing (I just don't enjoy the story, but my friends had never seen it) it was definitely well done. The costumes were extremely well done, and the talent pool from this show was just great. For this most recent trip we saw Wayne Brady's show and it was also well worth it. Not quite what I was expecting (I was expecting more comedy a la Who's Line type stuff), it was still worth seeing and something I'd definitely recommend. I haven't had the chance to dine everywhere yet at the Palazzo, here are some quick highlights of what we did have a chance to experience. I will note that I am an exceptionally picky eater and difficult to please when it comes to food- so take that with a grain of salt. In Feb 2008 we dined at Morrel's, and while the food was acceptable, it was not up to what I was expecting. It was moderately priced though and the service was exceptional. I would not come back to this restaraunt, but have heard good things about it from other friends that have dined here. We also ate at CUT for the first time in June 2008, and again on this trip. This place has got to be my new favorite steakhouse...ever. The food is a bit pricey ($300+ for two with a bottle of wine, appetizers, and desserts), but I think you could be a bit more careful with what you ordered if price was a consideration for you. The service has been impeccable both times we have been here, and the American-style Kobe beef they served was simply the best steak I've ever had. I also had the cook make a garlic butter wine sauce for me that wasn't on the menu. Not only were they able to easily accommodate this request, but it was superb. Wine list was extensive, and a nice, calming atmosphere to dine in- a great get away from the normal hubub of normal Las Vegas dinner options. Also, you must try the pretzel bread when they bring around the bread tray! Last but not least, a quick note on the Canyon Ranch Spa- I have had a few treatments done here over the year, in the spa and the salon. While the treatments were nice, I have not ever had the \"WOW\" experience that I was hoping for. I believe you can get simliar service from many of the other lower priced options out there at other properties. I know my spa back home charges around half the price for most of these treatments, and the quality is similiar. I will say that I do enjoy the fact that you can continue to use the rest of the spa area for the rest of the day you have a treatment scheduled on (this is normal with most spas though), the locker room area and sauna/steamroom areas are quite nice and a great way to relax after you have a treatment done. I usually plan on spending 45 minutes here before I get anything done, and a good 2 hours or so relaxing afterwards, it is well worth the time spent. Definitely a top-notch hotel that treats it's customers right. I would recommend this property to anybody looking to be pampered and taken care of on their vacation!!", "Date": "July 17, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Tennessee", "Title": "\u201cIncredible hotel rooms...especially for the price.\u201d", "Author": "missduvy", "ReviewID": "UR34959168", "Content": "Just returned from a 4-day stay at The Palazzo.

It is tastefully put together with first class amenities; yet, it is not pretentious or stuffy. The staff was always friendly and helpful. We booked an excellent internet offer at $109/night that made it too good to turn down. However, being incredibly hot in July, there were great hotel deals up and down the strip. Visiting just about every other hotel on the strip only reinforced the fact that we made the right decision. Encore/Wynn was next door and was probably the most comparable in luxury to the Palazzo. We also thought Mandalay Bay had a good vibe to it, although in our opinion, it is less conveniently located at the opposite end of the strip. We also liked Paris and of all the theme hotels, it was fun. Many people also like the Ballagio for its quality. The Palazzo lobby is impressive and the frangrance was actually an attractive amenity. While we heard some say differently, we preferred Palazzo over its sister resort, the Venetian. The two are connected via walkway by the Palazzo/Venetian shops. The Palazzo is newer than the Venetian and while Palazzo certainly has an Italian feel to it, it lacked the \"theme\" that Venetian and many of the other strip hotels have. Being one of the newest properties on the strip (maybe even the newest), the Palazzo was simply just a little nicer and a little better than even the other top tier hotels. After being up and down the strip several times during the trip, we preferred to be at the Palazzo end of the strip as opposed to the Luxor / Mandalay Bay end. The hotel is conveneniently located and within walking distance to most of the strip attractions. We walked a lot our first couple of days there. If you do not mind walking, you can certainly walk as far down as Paris and back one without any problem. You may not want to do it every day though, so the the Deuce (public transportation bus going up and down the strip) is a good reasonably priced alternative. It was $3 per person per ride or $7 for 24 pass. The Deuce will take you from one end of the strip to the other (and even downtown) and appeared to be a better more convenient alternative to walking, cab, and even the monorail. The casino was always busy and had a layout that we enjoyed. The games were spaced out nicely and not stacked up against each. Other casinos may have been bigger with more tables and slots, but we found Palazzo to be just the right size. It has a more intimate and personable feel that we prefered over the other casinos. While Palazzo is certainly not a boutique hotel, it seemed more welcoming and less overwhelming than other hotels without sacrificing quality or amenities We are not big gamblers (we gambled just a little each day) so our impression is based more upon atmosphere and ambiance than quantity and numbers. Bigger gamblers looking for casinos with masses of people and the excitement of numbers may enjoy the bigger casinos. What gambling we did do, we enjoyed doing in a more relaxed location. However, table minimums were higher at the Palazzo than many other hotels. Even though the ambiance was nicer at Palazzo, it was also fun to venture off the property every so often to play lower minimum tables at other casinos. Something has to pay for the ambiance at Palazzo, Wynn, and Bellagio, and it does not come from $5 Blackjack minimums. We ate at three restaurants on site. Grand Lux Cafe and First Food & Bar were both excellent and we would recommend both. Eneteco San Marco was not very good, and we would recommend avoiding it if at all possible. Jersey Boys was a good show at the Palazzo and is recommended. The standard rooms were probably one of the nicest, if not the nicest, of any standard room we have stayed at over the years. Being a newer property, everything was in great shape and tastefully decorated. There was plenty of room and three TV's. The bathrooms and showers were excellent. We were on the 20th floor with a great view of the strip and Treasure Island. The only negative comment for the room is that we could not seem to get the room cold enough at night. We usually like to cool the room down to a comfortable temperature before going to bed. While it would get somewhat cooler, it never really got cold in the room. It may have just been our room or it may have been due to the fact that we were there in July. In any event, it did not bother us enough to complain, just enough to wake up slightly uncomfortable a few nights. Overall, I do not think that you will find a nicer property while in Vegas.

Not exactly sure who or what they were looking for but it seemed a little unnecessary. I think it\u2019s to make guests FEEL a little bit safer by having extra security up front. The valet area has a beautiful fountain up front but as soon as we walked past the second set of doors we were actually floored, in a very bad way.

Was this the \u201cfair\u201d alternative to everyones gripes about self-selected lines at Wynn, Encore, and Bellagio?? Everyone was corralled into one main checkin line like cattle back home in Texas. Not exactly the most welcoming site but we made the most of the situation and stood in line like everyone else. (This was 5:00 pm Sunday, and yes even the VIP/Invited Guests desks had long lines too) After 45 mins in line, we were finally checked in without any hassles. When they formed the lines, they forgot to make exits. People were shoved and rolled over by heavy suitcases as they tried to leave the registration area. Hmmm. The hallways to the rooms have some of the worst signage of any hotel I have ever stayed at. I thought finding my room was awful, I had a horrible time finding my way back to the elevators! At first glance the room was very spacious and decorated in very nice soothing cool colors. But then I took a closer look. The cushions on the couch were very worn, deflated and needed some fluffing or replacing. The drawers at the desk did not slide on rails and couldn\u2019t be closed. The bathroom was missing shampoo and conditioner. The automatic drapes sounded like a freight train plowing through the room. Sigh. Not a deal breaker but I was hoping for more.

We called at 10 am and after a long pause the response felt like we were given a huge favor because of a 1 hour later checkout. Ok. We did not stay much at the Palazzo. It was just missing.... something. I couldn\u2019t quite put my finger on it but it didn\u2019t have the same energy or vibe as the Wynn or Encore. I think alot of it has to do with the lack of sunlight and alot of compact flourescent lighting. I also notice they played the exact same music throughout as the Wynn/Encore. I know because I bought the CD at the Wynn. Fishy. I tried to come to the Palazzo with an open mind. I tried to like it but felt mixed about the entire experience.

We spent 3 nights at Palazzo to celebrate my younger brother's 21st birthday. I am very picky when it comes to my travel plans and the places I stay, so I did quite a bit of research to be sure they would have the first time LV experience they deserved. Prior to booking at Palazzo, we had reservations at Bellagio and Encore, but I found a great code for Palazzo and decided to give it a try. Palazzo came through and then some! When we arrived, my family became kids in a candy store. They were very impressed with the grandeur of the lobby and the overall beauty of the hotel. This is what I've come to expect from Vegas - everything is over the top - but the Palazzo is quite beautiful. There is a distinct smell that many posters mention. None of us were offended by it and it's fairly subtle, but it is sweet and perfumy. No noticeable smokiness in the lobby, casino or any other public area. Derrick checked me in and when he heard we were celebrating, he was kind enough to offer me two rooms on the 48th floor, one of which had an amazing view of the Strip. The other had a very nice view of the Wynn hotel, pool and golf course. The rooms are amazing, from the comfortable beds to the stellar views, the bathrooms, the sitting area, the flat screens to the remote controlled shades. My brother felt like a king for his 3-day birthday celebration, just as I had intended it. I could barely pull him away from his iphone- he kept posting pictures of the room on his Facebook page for his friends to see! (I think that means I did a good job. ;) ) For the price you pay, I don't think Palazzo can be beat. I spent more time in the room than I ever have in the past, I enjoyed it so much! The pool area is large and separated into a number of smaller pools. I noticed that the kids/families tended to congregate in the first pool you walk past. We walked further off to the left hand side and found it to be much quieter. Throughout the morning, staff came by with complmentary ice cold towels and oranges, a great touch. Beverage service was plentiful. We didn't try Azure; I don't know how much they were charging and it looked empty. Their regular pool area is great as-is. I can't comment on any of the restaurants in Palazzo, though I did enjoy the fact that Venetian is connected and that we were able to get some quick meals there. I also don't gamble much, but I did sign up for a Club Grazie card to redeem the $50 slot credit that came with the room package. When he looked over my license, the staff member who registered me for Club Grazie mentioned we had the same birthday and gave me an extra $10 credit on my card. It's these unexpected things that make the service at Palazzo so great. My only complaint about Palazzo was that our room was showing a little bit of wear- one of the mirrored frames was cracked and there were some dents and scratches on the wall. I hardly noticed; I was too busy staring out our floor to ceiling windows at the lights of the Strip down below. I WILL stay at Palazzo on my next Vegas trip.

Just for signing up with the Pallazo's \"Club Grazie\" I began getting invitations as recently as last fall to slot tournaments (with a 3 night free room) and increasingly more offers of 2-4 nights at a time with free rooms in the mail. This last trip we stayed for 6 nights with my wife and 4 year old son, all for free. How? By (1) booking one of those 4-night mailer offers, then (2) talking to a Club Grazie host and finding out I could use my Club Grazie points for an extra 2 free nights in the same room (or should I say suite, at 720 sq. ft.) for 3,000 points per night. I began with 16,400 points, had 6,000 points deducted, and left with 24,500 points. Not only that, but because we gambled there every day, the hotel picked up all our charges, and I do mean all - even tips and movies - for the first four days of our stay, a nice little bonus worth at least $800.00. We spent time every day at their pools which are all child friendly, with ample space for little ones to walk around and swim in shallow water. Our son loved it. There are a lot of families with children here (more than I've seen elsewhere in Vegas) and speaking of people, we visited a number of our favorite places on this trip and the Palazzo was the only one that was really full of people on the casino floor every night. Word is obviously getting around about this place. It has something for everyone. I gave a brief review of this hotel about a month ago, and it still holds true. The only negative experience we had was with one housekeeper who kind of sneered at my wife when she asked her to clean the room between 4pm and 7 pm (and then failed to clean it) last Monday. None of the other maids gave us any trouble at all. BTW, if you're into slots, this place has all the most modern games in town. And people were playing them every night. I can't say enough about the Palazzo - it seems they picked up the best of Vegas on every level and then improved on it all.", "Date": "June 29, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Boston, Massachusetts", "Title": "\u201cGreat Value at a classy resort\u201d", "Author": "SOZE47", "ReviewID": "UR33264943", "Content": "SHUTTLE SERVICE TO THE AIRPORT We took the shuttle service for the Palazzo (I believe it is called Executive Coach and Carriage) for $6 each. We had to listen to a time-share pitch on the ride, which wouldn\u2019t have been so bad if the guy would have had some interest. It was just hard to watch this guy not get anyone to take him up on his tour with a large captive audience. Just made me feel bad, kind of like when you hear someone singing badly at a Karaoke Bar. ROOM NOTES We were only on the 11th floor, non-strip side, but with the 1200+ square foot suite was still a thrill for us even if it was on Mars. Some of the general thoughts on the room. - There was some wear and tear on the furniture and fixtures, but nothing that took away from a great, relaxing atmosphere. - The beds were amazing!! Pillows were soft and came in two sizes. - The bathroom is bigger then my roommate\u2019s bedroom. Huge walk-in shower, large Jacuzzi tub, and duel sinks for each of our shower supplies and toiletries. - There was a second \u00bd bathroom of the living room. - 3 TVs were all great to have. I thought it may be overkill to have so many, but I was amazed how nice it was to have them all. - Our windows were dirty on the outside and had bird poo on them. Our view wasn\u2019t that great, but we could see the golf course at Wynn/Encore from a low angle and the mountains in the background. - The remote control shades and blinds came in handy in the morning when I was trying to get us up out of bed. - The bathrobes were nice, but as I\u2019ve read on TA before, they were a little scratchy. - Housekeeping was great. We never received turndown service, but we didn\u2019t request it either. Plenty of towels were always left, beds always impeccable. My GF was in there once with them as they were cleaning and they had a great conversation about Las Vegas. CONCIERGE SERVICES I recommend email them before your trip as all I had to do was tell her in one email all the places I wanted to eat and at one time. She made it all happen and even created an itinerary for us. I was sure to drop an envelope off for her at the Concierge desk as a tip for her trouble. GENERAL NOTES ON THE PALAZZO I found this property to be exactly what I was looking for. Everyone was friendly, atmosphere was classy, and accommodations were just what I was looking for in a vacation with the GF. The Shoppes at the Palazzo and Venetian\u2019s Grande Canal were both filled with nice shops, most out of our price range. GC has the whole Venice theme going for it which is kind of fun if you happen upon it while walking through. I\u2019m not sure I\u2019d go out of my way to watch a choir show or stilt walkers out of personal preference, but I could see what some people get a kick out of walking through and taking it all in. There are some happy hour specials being offered at some places you wouldn\u2019t expect. I saw chalkboard drink specials at Table 10, Delmonico, one or two of Mario\u2019s places, and the best one, Sushisamba. Most places offered \u00bd price drinks, cheaper app prices, a few listed beers or wines on special, but this is a great way to get a taste of some great food without having to commit to a $50-$100 meal. The Palazzo scent/smell is definitely apparent every time you walk off the elevators or in from outside. It didn\u2019t bother me at all and it definitely did the trick to hide the smoke from the casino. It did not affect our stay and was not present in the room what-so-ever. The ever-so-popular Walgreens is a normal Walgreens, with a bunch of souvenirs. Prices were a little higher than the one I frequent in Boston, but nothing too outrageous. We loved our stay at the Palazzo and found the property\u2019s restaurants and bars to be its biggest assets. PALAZZO POOLS If you hit the pools in the morning, the main pool at the Palazzo is not in the sun yet. There have been many posts/comments on this on TA and it is true. If you are looking to catch a tan, you should head towards the Venetian, where the sun seems to be out all day long. The only big difference between the pool areas was that the Palazzo\u2019s seemed to have better drink service and a more relaxed atmosphere. The lounges had more padding on the Venetian side, but it they are brown so grab an extra towel to lay out on it because those things get hot. FRIDAY MORNING, CHECK-OUT AND CLUB GRAZIE I woke up and took my laptop to the free WIFI hotspot on the second floor of the Shoppes near the guest elevator. It was outside a coffee shop. After I did the online check-in thing for that evening\u2019s red-eye back to Boston, I went back up to the room to pack with GF. Check-out was seamless, just like most of the other experiences we had with the Palazzo. The only thing for some people to notice is that the hold they put on my cc at the beginning of the trip didn\u2019t come off until nearly four days after check-out. They said 24-48 hours at checkout. This was no big deal, but wanted to share. Another thing to note to people who book via a third party like Travelocity or Orbitz. The address they list you as when you arrive is not actually your address, but the address of the company you booked through. It would be a good idea to straighten it out at check-in just to avoid any unforeseen consequences. We stashed our bags with the Palazzo luggage crew down in the lower lobby next to the cab bay. Most hotels have baggage systems and will gladly hold bags for guests if you get their early enough and they have enough spare capacity. Club Grazie gave GF and I each $15 for starting accounts, plus we had a $50 slot credit from our room package on Travelocity. Also, clarify your address with CG too, as anyone, not just guests can be CG members so they have two different systems. I have already received offers for some pretty cheap rates from the Palazzo/Club Grazie (one this week was $109 a weeknight, $159 weekend night) and I\u2019ve only been home for a week. Overall, we stayed here because we got a really great rate on Travelocity, but we lucked out on getting upgraded during check-in which is why we were staying in such a great room. I felt very comfortable everywhere and it is a nice place to call homebase. Other properties have more lively attractions, but having a nice, calming place to come back to was great.", "Date": "June 26, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Toronto", "Title": "\u201cA fabulous hotel in Las Vegas!\u201d", "Author": "busymomtraveller", "ReviewID": "UR33166500", "Content": "The Palazzo was the best hotel I've ever stayed at in Las Vegas.

We dined at the gourmet restaurants in Palazzo and Venetian and charged everything to our suite, thus accumulating a lot of points on my Grazie card (for casino comps).

I had stayed here previously shortly after it opened and liked it, but I believe they were still working out the kinks. The Palazzo has now hit its stride and I believe this is due to their clear focuson the hotel side of their business, in stark contrast to many hotels on the strip where the rest of the hotel seems to take a back seat to, and/or be designed to drive you towards the casino. My most recent stay was a real pleasure, starting with check-in. We were coming from THEhotel, so showed up quite early. We were greeted in the short line-up (surprising as I thought it would be huge due to people checking out, but the Palazzo wisely has separate lines for both check-in and check-out, as well as an in-room checkout system that actually works) by a \"greeter\", who chatted with us while we waited and then walked us to the check-in desk. A nice touch (and the first of many). Not only was our room ready, but we were upgraded to one of the Sienna suites. This thing was among the nicest rooms we have ever stayed in and at over 1200 square feet might be the largest. Super clean, super classy. 3 flatscreens, and every other amenity you could want or need, including your own fax machine and multi-jet shower. If you ever get the chance to stay in one of these rooms you should take it - even at their current full price it would cost less than the comparable suite we stayed at in Hawaii last year. The hotel pools are also fantastic, and we never had a problem getting a spot. More nice touches - they bring around cold towels, ice water and orange slices for you during the day, in addition to regular rounds by the wait staff. My only minor complaint with the pool is that due to the orientation of the hotel, the sun doesn't make it around the building until around noon. However, in the depths of summer and 100+ degree temperatures this is probably not the worst thing in the world. The rest of the hotel is also top notch. The casino is on the smaller side but there always seemed to be room at the tables, and there were a wide range of table limits. The soaring ceilings in the casino and throughout the main level also made for a relatively smoke-free experience and really added to the ambience. We ate almost all of our meals on-site or at the adjoining Venetian, which features a number of options from top-end celebrity chef restaurants to a food court - Carnevino, San Telmo and Del Toro were our favorites but we'd have to stay another week to have gone to them all. There is also some great on-site shopping with many unique shops, some of which were window-shop-only for us but still interesting to see. The sports book was also a great spot to watch a game. Finally, the location can't be beat. The Fashion Show Mall is kitty-corner, you've got every level of casino from Wynn and Caesar's to O'Shea's within a 5-10 minute walk, and its a short cab ride to the outlets and downtown.

We chose the Palazzo because of an offer for 3 nights, comped at either Venetian or Palazzo,and since Palazzo is so new, we wanted to give it a try. This would be our first stay at either property.

Upon entering the hotel, we were greeted and shown to Invited Guest check-in. The check-in clerk was very pleasant, gave us an overview of the hotel, our offer and offered us our choice of a high or low floor. Our offer was for a Bella Suite, facing the strip, $150 slot credit and $50 food credit. We chose a high floor and were given the 48th floor, room 712. It had a perfect view of TI and Mirage. We were able to view both the Mirage Volcano show and the Siren\u2019s show at TI. Although we were a little high up to see the Sirens very well, but I don\u2019t think we missed anything. We had a beautiful view of the mountains beyond the hustle and bustle of the Strip. The check in clerk said he would send up or luggage and it arrived within 15 minutes. The room was everything we hoped for and just as beautiful as the pictures on the website. The room was not worn, nothing was broken and there wasn\u2019t a moth to be found! Housekeeping did a great job, no complaints. The turn down service was nice, and we enjoyed the chocolates left on our pillows. We ate at the Grand Luxe restaurant after arriving at the resort. The pizza and salad we had was very good and very reasonably priced. Two mornings we ordered breakfast from room service. The person taking the order greeted me by name and was very helpful and pleasant. Our meal arrived in about 30 minutes each time. The server covered the dining table with a white tablecloth...very elegant. Now, it was kind of pricey, but very good (and hot) and it was nice to lounge around the beautiful suite in the morning, having our breakfast in front of the window with that wonderful view. The In Suite Dining Menu is listed on the Palazzo website if you want to check the prices. They do add tax, a service charge and 18% gratuity. There is a Walgreens on Las Vegas Blvd in front of the Palazzo. Had to pick up a few items we forgot to pack and could pick up bottled water a little cheaper than in the hotel. The Walgreens is also open 24 hours. We enjoyed the casino. It's a bit smaller that the Venetian and I like that. We play slots and there is a wide variety of fun machines. Probably would have had more fun if we'd won big, but had a great time anyway. The resort smells amazing, so clean and fresh.

When the dust cleared, we went with the Palazzo - little bigger rooms, little more free stuff in the package. Outside of check in, where the front desk clerk was forgot to give me my spa package and was a little short with about everything, I have nothing bad to say about the hotel. Housekeeping, which seemed to be a problem with some guests, was not in my instance - towels were replaced, the room was cleaned nightly. On top of that, the housekeeping staff was very friendly - there was not a single time a member of the staff did not smile and greet me. That rarely happens in any hotel. The rooms were outstanding. No stains on furniture, no signs of wear and tear. The bed was unbelievably comfortable. The view (36th floor overlooking the Strip) was excellent. The HVAC, the bathrooms...all exceeded expectations. I used the internet connection...wasn't overly happy about having to pay for it, but it was what it was. The two large flat screen TV's in the room was very nice. The bathroom TV was cool but I didn't use it. The casino floor isn't that big, but it's not far to the Venetian, and a short walk to the Mirage or TI. There is no poker room and a small, out of the way sports book. If you want either, walk through the concourse and shops and head to the Venetian. The casino staff was friendly, which, again, is generally rare. The Canyon Ranch Spa was pricey, but top-notch. The equipment was clean and well maintained. The staff was very friendly. The physical asset itself is very, very impressive. It's overboard, but nearly everything in Vegas is overboard. This is....tastefully overboard. Plus, the hotel/casino doesn't have a trace of a smoke smell. The place does have a scent, and I know some people don't like it. I didn't find it overpowering. Better that than smoke smell. Points to the hotel for having security by the elevators. The hallways in the hotel were quiet, and I think that has a lot to do with it.

Although our room wasn't ready (we arrived at 1pm), they called us within 45 minutes to tell us that it was ready. Also we ended up getting a strip view even though we hadn't even requested one (bonus!), so we had a view of the Sirens of TI show every night. Our room was on the 44th floor, so we really didn't hear the show at night, certainly not enough to be disturbed by it. The room was a standard suite, King bed, 3 TVS, very clean and spacious. I read some previous reviews that indicated housekeeping here was spotty--we did not have this experience. In fact, housekeeping came every morning like clockwork, it seemed--the room was cleaned by 1pm every day. I LOVE the amenities on the Concierge level but this is personal preference--depends on what you like to determine whether you think it's worth it. For me, I loved being able to get my coffee and some breakfast each morning without waiting in line at a coffee bar. Also, the open bar every night was great for us, as were the appetizers in the evenings--bacon-wrapped scallops, mini eggrolls, quiches, that type of thing. Also, we did not have to pay for ANY cocktails, as one reviewer experienced--and we ordered all kinds of things (margaritas, chocolate martinis, which were fabulous, by the way, and cosmos). We did, of course, tip the bartenders and servers though. For the extra $100 a night it costs (about) on the Concierge level, we definitely got our money's worth, but again, depends on what you like and whether you are going to be around the hotel enough to take advantage of it. All the staff was extremely pleasant, helpful, and most of the staff in the Concierge lounge called us by name by the second visit, which is a nice personal touch. The Club Grazie staff was also very nice and helpful. We spent a little time at the pool, there are several that you have access to as you share with the Venetian (I think maybe 8 or 9 pools total?). We had no problem finding chairs, but we did have to go to the bar to get drinks, cocktail service was a little slow. We didn't really worry too much about it--not that big of a burden to get up and go to the bar. We normally went to the pool in the afternoon (3pm or so) so it could be people that most people went earlier than that. At any rate it certainly wasn't too crowded when we were there. The ONLY downside that I experienced is that we ate at Lavo (Italian restaurant), and it was disappointing. Quite pricey for just standard fare (pasta, steak, etc.), and the service was EXTREMELY slow on a Sunday night. Additionally, once we actually got our food, my husband's steak was so overcooked we had to send it back (normally we are pretty laid back about things like that, but for $50 the steak should be cooked as ordered, I think!). They did replace it in short order, but in hindsight, I wish they had just taken it off the bill instead. So, not a great experience there.

Still not sure if I'd opt for this option again. Pools - I think there are something like 8 of them. You share them with the Venetian. With so many to choose from (small, large, spas, etc) you should be able to find the perfect pool to lounge around. Safe and Secure - Room safes worked great. It is nice that they check room keys before you can get into the elevator area or go out to the pools. The self park option worked out good but beware, you will most likely be dragging your bags through the lobby unless you locate the right parking escalator/exit. Restaurants - We really enjoyed the Grand Lux (operated by The Cheesecake Factory) and close to the elevator entrance. They offer a nice all you can eat breakfast buffett and if you order off the menu the portions are large for the money you pay. On the downside we dined at the Sushisamba in The Shoppes, ugh, expensive, not much food and food wasn't good at all (we sampled six different items and only one was palatable). Negatives Service - As mentioned above I opted for the more expensive Concierge level. Open bar is great for basic drinks (good selection of beers, wine and basic drinks) but if you want something special (a Mojito for example) they'll ask that you pay for it so open bar isn't totally open. Now here is the part where I was really disappointed with the Palazzo (and why I didn't give the place a 5 rating). The service our first night was outstanding, we had a gal who took excellent care of us, made sure our drinks were always refreshed and she was just a great lady very helpful and friendly. The next three nights, the service was awful. No one to refresh drinks which is no problem as I can go up to the bar, but because of the lack of service the food was replenished slowly and tables were never cleaned. So you would show up, stand in line for a drink (only one bartender working), discover there was little to no food and then find plenty of dirty tables in need of cleaning/clearing which mean't you had no place to sit. They also talk about free newspapers in the conceire lounge, no such luck. I asked one of the front desk concierge attendants about newspapers and was told \"they are probably late\". For the four days we were there, there wasn't newspaper one. I guess when you pay for conceire level service you expect it. I sometimes wonder if I shouldn't have just opted out of the Concierge level and brought a large cooler and purchased beer/wine/water at the Walgreens in front of the Venetian or the gift shop near the main room entrance. If anyone from the Palazzo is reading this I'd recommend hiring more people for the Concierge lounge. Room - Others have griped about the lack of soap dishes and I have to agree. When you take a shower there is no where to place soap bars or bottles. Also the shower curtain doesn't even come close to touching the ground so flooding the bathroom is an easy task to accomplish. Figuring out the light controls for the rooms takes awhile. Just make sure you have the main light switch on at the entrance or you'll be cussing trying to figure out how to turn on the lights elsewhere in the room. Expensive - Beware, things can get pricey in this place. My advice to save some bucks, buy your drinks, snacks, etc at the Walgreens in front of the Venetian. The in room fridge is chock full of expensive drinks and essentially has no room for any drinks you might need to chill. Drinks around the pool are in the $8 a beer price range. Always look for special deals on rooms that the hotel offers instead of paying full bore. We ventured down to Harrahs one night for gambling (most certainly not as nice as the Palazzo gambling facility but lower min bet rates). There were numerous times at the Palazzo where you'd see MANY empty blackjack tables, one dealer no players where the minimum bet was $25 but then you'd find one FULL table with a lower bet min ($15 from what I remember). Overall I don't think you can beat this place for a wonderful room, outstanding location and high class atmosphere.", "Date": "June 6, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Galena, Ohio", "Title": "\u201cGreat Stay!\u201d", "Author": "travelerSL", "ReviewID": "UR31694994", "Content": "We stayed for 4 nts in a concierge level suite due to the great rates. Having been to Vegas many times, and usually stay in a tower suite at the Mirage, the suites in the Palazzo are about 1/2 the size of the Mirage but very well appointed. The real difference is that the suites at the Palazzo are one big room so if one person is an early riser, and the other not there is no way to close off the sleeping area. The A/C in the suite area worked great, but there is just one small vent in the bath and there did not seem to be any A/C in there. Amenities in the room were very nice, and the housekeeping staff left us 4 sets of towels as requested, daily. Our suite was a strip view, and we could watch the show at TI from our room. I did not realize until after 2 days that you can request a complimentary newspaper delivered to your room. I then requested one, but never got any. Any additional cost for the concierge is well worth it. The private check in saved us from the huge crowds downstairs, and the morning coffee and evening cocktails were wonderful. We used the concierge service for dinner reservations, as well as to print our boarding passes. We went to Azure (new adult pool) one day and were told as we entered it was a $150 per person minimum spending. We started to leave and they changed it and said, only $50 per person so don't know what the true minimum was suppose to be. At any rate, the service was great, but we did not care for the techno music blasted from the DJ, or some of the lewdness, but the pool did draw a crowd. The food served here comes from the Wolfgang Puck restaurant Solaro at the main pool, but the prices are much higher. A cheesburger was $25, while on the regular menu I believe it was $18. Azure is like being at a nightclub during the day. We went to another small pool on another day and enjoyed the atmosphere much more. We dined at many of the property restaurants. Delmonicos was good, The CUT was excellent, Dal Toro was nice for lunch and they have tables outside. We also had appetizers and drinks at Dos Caminos, just OK and dinner at Grand Lux which was very good casual dining. A nice resprite from the sights and sounds of Vegas is the country club at the Wynn next door. We enjoyed lunch on their patio overlooking a huge waterfall, while watching the golfers putt on the 18th hole. Good food, too. The casino was clean, had a nice variety of games, and the slots did give back some of what we deposited. The highlight of this trip was the Jersey Boys. It was fantastic!

You would think that a resort in a town that has been so negatively affected by the recession would be bending over backward to to provide exceptional customer service.

I could take a smoking room or wait, so I took a room with two queen beds. The rooms were well appointed and the bathroom was spectacular. However, the lighting system was not well-designed nor intuitive, the AC didn't work properly and there was never really hot water available in the shower. The maid service didn't come until well after 5 p.m. - which explains why rooms probably weren't ready for check-ins. The wait service in the casino bars and restaurants was very, very slow and the staff was indifferent at best. Because I decided to take a red-eye back home, I wanted to extend my stay to later that evening. There is no complimentary late check-out. You pay for different times throughout the day you want to check out. And, you can't handle this from you room. You have to physically go back down to the front desk (before 11 a.m.) and make these arrangements. For someone attending a conference, this is very inconvenient. I really don't care if they use my name at check-in/check-out. I want them to make my experience convenient and enjoyable. The highlight of the resort was the valet service - that was spot on.

Great hotel, great price, great service and we would highly recommend this hotel. We reserved a regular room (to my knowledge, all of the rooms are suites) on the Concierge Level. We received a great rate on a discount Vegas website which included all of the Concierge Level amenities. Upon check in, the rate and amenities were honored. We let it slip to the Concierge who checked us in that it was our Anniversary and we were upgraded to a room with a view for no additional cost. Our room was beautiful, with a great view of the obnoxiously gold Trump Tower and Treasure Island. Services on the Concierge Level: The service and amenities on the Concierge Level were wonderful. It was totally worth a few extra dollars to have a deluxe continental breakfast (cinnamon buns, toast, bagels, cereal, fruit, ham/cheese croissants, and more) each morning, afternoon tea, and even enough appetizers to make a dinner out of (egg rolls, mini hotdogs, quiche, soup, etc). The free drinks during cocktail hour were appreciated, even though it\u2019s not hard to get a free drink in Vegas. The service during cocktail hour was suburb and the wait staff had marvelous drink suggestions. The Concierge Room is huge with lots of comfortable seats, couches, and lounges. The free wifi service is \u201chit or miss\u201d in the main room. But, I received better reception as I walked further to the back of the Concierge Room. Rooms: The room was a standard room, but it was huge and very clean. We asked for turndown service two of the nights we were there, but only received the service once. We called to inquire about why we didn\u2019t receive the service one night and it was resolved the next morning. Not a huge deal. Our room did not have any moths \u2013 although we did notice them around the hotel and in the Concierge Room. In all honesty, I probably would not have noticed the months unless I read the review on Trip Advisor. It really is not a big deal. Casino: The casino at the Palazzo is big and beautiful. If you are a new member to the Grazzi Club, you receive $25 in slot play. And, the best part is, if you win on the free slot play, you are awarded real money instead of credits. It was a really good promotion. We were happy to see some table games were at a $5 minimum mid-week during our stay. We only saw it once, but made sure to play while it was nice low minimums. Pool: As a guest at the Palazzo, you\u2019re able to use the Venetian and the Veinezza pools. The Palazzo pool(s) were lovely and plenty of nice shade in the mornings. The afternoon gets quite sunny, but you\u2019re able to find shade if need be. Great service by the pool too. Other: I recommend getting the checked luggage service from the desk in the main lobby. This was a huge stress and time saver. $20 got our luggage checked and boarded on to our flight several hours we left the hotel. Just be sure you give them about 4 hours notice. Southwest and US Airways were the airlines that participated. I wish more airlines were involved. It was a great service and totally worth the price.

The hotel is lovely, very fresh-smelling (i.e. no smoke smell), and the gaming floor is nicely laid out. We had a good experience at check-in on a Saturday afternoon - minimal wait time. Our first room was very spacious - a typical Palazzo/Venetian suite. The bed linens were nice, but I was disappointed at two things - the bed wasn't triple sheeted and turn-down service wasn't standard (you had to request it by 5 pm). I thought these last two points were inconsistent with a luxury property. The furniture upholstery also seemed pretty worn for hotel only 1.5 years old. That being said, the room and bathroom were large and comfortable. Here's my gripe about the place - even though it was very pretty, we had way too many maintenance issues. In the first room we had, the safe did not function, which we didn't realize until we were leaving for dinner - then played phone tag with maintenance to set up a repair. They refused to work on the safe when we weren't in the room - even though it was empty since we couldn't use it! We also had several moths in the room (we were told it was moth season in LV) and a few burned out lightbulbs. The worst was when I went to take a shower on our first night there and the shower handle broke off in my hand! After that, they agreed to put us in another room. The second room we looked at (on our 2nd day there) was lovely, but reeked of smoke despite being a non-smoking room. We finally ended up in a ridiculously large suite that had supposedly been inspected by a front desk manager and a housekeeping manager. Again, the suite was very pretty and very big - but buttons popped off the couch when my husband (who weighs less than 200 pounds) sat on it, door handle hardware was loose or broken on two different doors, and the shower (which had a fixed shower head and a handheld shower) had seen better days - the handheld shower didn't fit in its cradle (it was obviously a replacement) and just hung to the floor on its hose. It's such a shame - the hotel really was pretty and they tried their darndest to make things right. With the exception of one snotty operator (they share operator service with Venetian), everyone was friendly and helpful. Unfortunately, it's very obvious that maintenance is suffering at this property. Other reviewers seemed to love the hotel and their rooms - perhaps we just had an aberrant experience with a small handful of rooms. Luckily, the pool area was beautiful and we had no trouble finding a couple shady spots. Drink service from waitresses was minimal - I maybe saw one or two waitresses in two days - but the pool bar was nice. Lunch (pizzas and sodas) from the pool restaurant was great.

We headed to the check in desk and waited maybe 5 minutes to check in. We were greeted in line and then escorted and introduced by name to an agent who checked us in. They were all very professional and always had a smile. We headed up to our room which was huge, 940 square feet. All the Fortuna Suites have a view and ours was on the 15th floor with a view of the pool and TI. It was fantastic. The walk in closet was very nice and the bathroom was wonderful. All the electronics worked and everything was clean. There was a door on the living room tv stand that didn\u2019t close all the way but other than that, the room was perfect.

Check-in: We arrived at around 1pm on a Friday, the check-in line wasn't too long. Like previous posters, I was very disappointed that you had to pay extra to use the fitness center. However, one very important thing to note: If you go to the Spa/fitness center directly they will charge you $40 a day for access. If you ask at the front desk and buy your access there, they can give you a deal - we got it for $29.95 a day, minimum 2 days. They also give you two $20 dining credits to use at the hotel (includes restaurants like LAVO and SushiSamba), two Madame Tussaud's passes, and a slot credit (it was $15 or $20). With all of these bonuses, it practically pays for itself. Walking through the casino to the hotel elevators I noticed that it still smells new, no nasty smoke! We also requested a non-smoking floor, and there were no hints of smoke at all. Rooms: It goes without saying that the rooms are great. The beds are very comfortable and the linens are nice. The bathroom was more than large enough. A couple of disappointments here were: 1. the towels were not very soft at all 2. i wonder what they were thinking when they designed the separate water closet with the toilet. the only way to access the WC is through the bathroom. it really makes no sense to have it behind another door if you can't access it by itself from inside the room- without bothering anyone who may be in the shower or tub. 3. same question goes for the second vanity with mirror. it would be much more useful if it was place outside in the room. Numbers 2 and 3 I say because we were three girls in the same room. I imagine that if you were there with your significant other it may not be an issue.

You may think by reading this that it was due to happy hour prices, but that is not the case. Friday at 4pm I paid $10 for a frozen vodka lemonade from a waitress. Seemed reasonable enough. On Saturday it was $12, from a waitress. Sunday before 2pm they charged me $15. At this point, I said something to the waitress and she said that \"they\" (I can only assume she meant management) had just changed the prices on drinks and they were in the process of getting things updated. So I just shook it off. Finally on Monday I went directly to the bar, where I was charged $9 and then $12 for the same frozen vodka lemonade. It had become completely laughable by then, and the girl behind the bar flipped the screen around to show me that the computer really said $12. Long story short, you may want to ask before you buy... just so they can't hit you with random prices. Restaurants: We ate at quite a few places in the hotel. Canyon Ranch Grill - we ate here every morning for breakfast. Completely yummy and healthy. LAVO - pricey but the food was great & the atmosphere was fun. I highly recommend the kobe beef rice ball appetizer. but beware, it's the size of a softball!! we also went here later for the nightclub. VERY crowded on the dance floor but fun otherwise. SushiSamba - decent, but very overpriced. the service we received while sitting at the bar for our meal was less than satisfying. Table 10 - inventive cocktails, great salads - pricey Woo - sat at the bar and had the Chinese Chicken Salad. very tasty and the bartender Marty was very nice Overall, had a great time.

First morning room service tried to charge us $50 for toast and OJ - when I showed her our coupon for free breakfast as part of package we purchased she was confused and had no idea what it was.

My girlfriend and I went on a Birthday gettaway looking for fun times leading to great memories. I researched long and hard before I settled on the Palazzo, and the second I set foot in the room I was extremely dissapointed ,which is an understatement.! We upgraded our room to a view of the strip and then had to hump our large peices of luggage through the Casino and up to the room because there was no one available to help. Once we got to our room we went straight over to the window to check out the view and to our horror we were \"attacked\" by large bat sized moths! We both started screaming and freaking out, the moths were every where we turned and there was at least 50 of them (my friend later counted them when they settled on the walls/ceiling/drapery/and bedding). And about 20 dead ones all over the floor. We were both pretty rattled and shook up by this and immediatly phoned the front desk, I was crying on the phone cause honestly I have never seen anything like it, they said they would send house keeping up to clean the room. We were not going to stay in the room, there was just too many of them, and it was like a flash back to the, 'silence of the lambs\" movie, we needed a different room. We waited out in the hall way for over 2 hours, and repeatedly went back into the room to phone the front desk and speak with a manager, they kept assuring us someone was coming. As other guests walked past us we asked them if they had a \"moth\" problem, and no one else did. An employee of the hotel was delievering room service and we told them what was happening, they were astonished we were still waiting and had heard nothing about a moth problem. Finally a bell man came to change our room, he too couldn't believe our story. We had him check the new room, he was a 6 foot man that was scared to shake the curtains and as he did it jumped out of the way. After he combed the room for flying critters he left us. We sat there for a bit unsure of what might leap out at us, we both needed a stiff drink to calm our nerves, we finally left the room at 2:30 a.m. Keep in mind we arrived at the hotel at 10:00 p.m. and after our big scare, and waiting hours for a room change we were finally leaving the hotel 4.5 hours later. We went to the front desk to see if there was anything they could do to kick start our holiday in a better direction, they said they could give us late check out, whoopie! Needless to say we had a fabulous time, we gambled, we drank, we danced, we partied, we shopped, we ate and we did all this in every hotel except the Palazzo. When we did return to the hotel and asked the concierge for shopping info they were unprepared, they had no booklets no coupons and reffered us to the mall concierge for those items, to have the mall concierge say we had to pay for them because our hotel was too lazy to keep up their stock. Our room had broken amenities, light bulbs burnt out and lacked toiletries. We had to phone repeatedly about getting them replaced and fixed to have them come and be unprepared and unequipped with the correct product. Needless to say we only slept 5 hours the whole trip and we attribute it to having way too much fun and a strong urge to just stay away from the Palazzo, cause inevitably every time we returned there was a glitch! Do not drink from the mini bar, and do not order room service. 2 orders of Begals and lox and a basket of fries will run you around $65, and a bottle of water costs $10, the tap water tastes awful so you are bound to grab a bottle of water out of desperation! We never did turn any of the 3 t.v.'s on, but laughed that they probably didn't work anyway. For the price you pay to stay at this hotel I surely expected a lot more in the room, and customer service. I don't know if it's because the Managers are like \"21\" that they are unprepared, or have no power but they certainly have no idea when it comes to running this hotel. This was my 5th visit to Vegas, and I will certainly go again...next time Belagio. The Belagio was by far the most \"happen\" place to be for gambling, with the most nicest Pit boss, waitresses and dealers you could ever meet. Plus the nightlife there was huge!

The check-in was a little long, but not too bad. The hotel is immense, as are all the hotels in Vegas. This was my wife and I's first trip back to Vegas for about 6 years, it sure does get bigger everytime you go... The Casino floor in the Palazzo is great, very lavishly decorated, laid out well, with good signs for where to go for restaurants, the shops, etc. There are guards at the elevators to stop anyone who isn't staying at the hotel from going up the elevators. We stayed in a basic suite. It was 2/3's of the way up the tower, can't remember exactly which floor, but it was not a concierge suite. The room was fantastic. Still looked new, smelled clean, and all the upholstery/carpet/bed linen was in great shape, with the exception of a little melted carpet. Someone had dropped the iron on the floor, lol. The room was huge. double vanities, big shower, separate tub, huge bed area, and a step-down lounge area. Great view of the strip. Great TV's, with actual HD broadcasting. (I can't stand places that advertise HDTV, then you get there and they don't even have an HD signal) Can't find one thing to complain about whatsoever about the room, it was really, really great. We ate in the Gran Lux Cafe, which was very good. Also got drinks at Double Helix, which is right in the middle of the shopping area, great wine list there. We ate one night at Sushi Samba. Not impressive, IMO. Way too loud for a dinner place (it was literally as loud as a nightclub), small portions, not that exciting for the price tag. Everywhere in Vegas is ridiculously expensive, but some of the restaurants are worth paying for, and some aren't, IMO. We went to club Lavo one night... yeah, that made me feel old. The upstairs part of Lavo is definitely for the kiddies (25 and under) while the main floor/lounge area was more to our liking. If you actually want to booze it up at any of these places while you are here, take out a second mortgage before you come out... $9 for a beer and $4.50 FOR A DIET COKE!!! insane. The ridiculous prices for food/drink are par for the course everywhere, though, so that's not a reflection on the Palazzo, but I thought i'd point it out. The shopping in the Palazzo is very good. We shopped a lot, and were pleasantly surprised with how helpful the staff in the stores were in general, all over. They have one watch store that has some exquisite timepieces (FP Journe, Vacharon, Patek, etc, etc. Barneys, Chloe, Louboutin were some of my wife's favorites. Lots of 'high-end everything' to look at!! Gripes about the Palazzo? Well, we did hear the Traesure Island pirate show/rock concert at night, while we were in the room but it definitely didn't bother us one bit. I could see how some people would not like it though. Other than that, I really don't have any negatives... Vegas in general takes forever to walk around, just because of the layout. For instance, we went to Treasure Island for dinner, and Mystere, and it literally took us 30 minutes to get there from our room... It's that far through the laborynth they have set up for pedestrian crossing. This is no different than anywhere else on the strip though.

We booked at the Venetian and were \"upsold\" to the Palazzo for a larger room. The room was very nice, but not worth the price (3 nights for $847, which included a $30 food credit at Woo (didn't use), $50 slot credit and a 2for1 at Madame Toussad's (didn't use) and the gondola ride, kids did it but were bored). The positives were nice room, good location away from the busiest part of the strip (and some of the more adult-oriented establishments); pools were nice; all the restaurants were good (but expensive). But the room needs repairs and upkeep (three broken drawers, missing faucet handle!! stickers left on ceilings!!!); the cost was very high for what you get (not even any coffee in the room -- you have to buy it downstairs). and all the restaurants seem overpriced -- but I guess that you are paying more for the \"upscale\" atmospheres. Security was very good (I like the fact that they check room keys at the hotel and pools); nice spa; Grand Lux Cafe was great for breakfast (but $$$); CarneeVino was great steak and service (but $$$$$).

The hotel is easy to get around in too...it's layed out well. This is an \"all suites\" hotel and the rooms are very nice. Even the standard suite was very roomy and nice. When staying there, spring for the extra cost to have \"the stip view\", it's worth it. My room was on the 31st floor, directly over the expansive pool area with a great view of the entire valley and the surrounding mountains. (fabulous at night) Bath room was great with tv, phone, separate make up area for her, twin sinks, large walk-in shower and large soaking tub, separate toilet room, complimentary plush bath robes and slippers and quality bath products were provided. The bedding was luxurious and veeeery comfortable. High quality linens and pillows are provided. A large flat panel tv is positioned well for ease of viewing from the bed. The living area of the suite is nice too. Another large tv is situated in the living area along with a desk/work area. A fax/printer is there for your use as well. (extra charge, but handy if needed.) A four seater dining table is in the living area too, which is made up for your in room dining, complete with crisp white table cloth, napkins...the works.

From the front desk staff to the security personnel, all were gracious and willing to help. We were the reason they were there and they knew it. My wife was with me so I was able to enjoy a little more than the usual business trip. We saw two shows; The Phantom of the Opera and The Jersey Boys. I recommend seeing both shows, as they were very good. Dining was outstanding too. In the Palazzo, Emeril's restaurant, Table 10, was a 10. Food quality and service were perfect. (I don't use that word often to describe a restaurant!) In the Venetian, Tao was surprisingly good. We were not expecting the interesting menu and great tastes of this pan asian restaurant. The sushi was very good! The pool area is great. Complete with everything you may need close by; dining/drinks, supplies, towels, etc. The area is made up of several pools which gives you plenty of options for the day.

Appreciated how they had someone to meet you at the front of the check in line and escort you to the next available agent. We requested a refrigerator for our room and we were provided one free of charge. We had a room on the 26th floor facing the Wynn pools and golf course. A beautiful view that didn't make it worth it to upgrade for a strip view. As I love a darkened room in the morning, really liked the remote controlled curtains that kept the room pitch black. Unlike other hotels the Palazzo actually provided HD channels on the 3 flat screen TVs. Unlike other reviewers I found the room perfectly clean each day and the furniture was not worn. One warning, if you turn off the master switch by the front door at night the light in the toilet areas won't turn on, so be more selective about turning off individual lights rather than the master. Only other complaint about the room is that the bed and pillows were rather hard for my liking. Strange as it seems there are no more comfortable beds in Las Vegas than the ones at Treasure Island. We spent an afternoon by the pool. Appreciate that it was on the third floor so did not need to walk through the casino or lobby. Although the pools were crowded we did not have any trouble finding chairs and had many options. As others have noted drink service is extremely slow. We ordered a pitcher of sangria and it took almost an hour for the waitress to return with it. My wife actually had time to order a pizza from Solaro and return with it before our drinks arrived. Pizza was very good by the way. Also had an issue where I paid the waitress by credit card but my room was also charged. Front desk took care of the charge quickly though.

Nobody from the bell desk approached us as we got out of our taxi from the airport, but that was okay with me. Our room was beautiful. Although it was the \"lowest\" as far as cost, it was an excellent place to stay for four days. Our room looked out over the Wynn golf course. By day the view wasn't much, but at night the view was nice. We had beautiful sunrises each morning over the mountains as well. The room had tons of space as I had heard. The bathroom was wonderful with a separate toilet room, separate shower, and beautiful fixtures. Our bed was very comfortable, as was the sectional sofa in the sleeping area. My only complaints about the room I could come up with was the cordless phone by the bed didn't seem to work at all. And the remote for the tv was very slow to respond in my opinion. Neither were big problems as we didn't watch much, if any, tv, nor did we talk on the phone. We enjoyed the proximity of this hotel to Wynn, Venetian, TI, and Mirage. The smell in the casino and common areas that seems to bother so many, didn't bother me at all. I actually like it. My wife and I got great coffee and pasties at the Coffee Bean by the elevators.

The laundry is the same price for kids clothes & adults & it is very expensive. 5 items were \u00a335. We loved the Palazzo until we saw the Wynn. The Wynn was much more elite & more of a wow factor so next time i will be staying there. However, the Palazzo was all good, service, staff, rooms were all excellent. The only snag was the phones in the room & the showers. If you like a powerfull shower then get someone in right away to adjust the power & the phone batteries keep going dead. We went with kids & we had a baby sitter every night for 10 nights which was very expensive!!! I would strongly recommed travelling without kids but did not have a choice. The hotel does not have baby sitting facilities & I was not told that childrten under 5 are not permitted in most of the top shows. We saw the Blue Man group which I did not enjoy as much as the other shows. We loved Phantom Of The Opera & Arthur Frank Magic was excellent in the Tropicana Hotel (That you must take kids to see. ) You can buy tickets from the half price booth outside Fashion Show Mall. You must go to Tao on a weekend which is very similar to Budha Bar. We enjoyed the food at TAO & the abience & music were excellent. We also ate at Grand Luxe, Lambourgini, Woo, Zine Noodles Dimsum, Carnevino. All were very different & I would highly recomend except for the last which was way to expensive & plain. We managed to get half price tickets for Phantom of the Opera which was the highlight of the holiday. Shopping was great in Vegas but due to the exchange rate, London is cheaper. However, portions are huge. Overall, I would choose the Palazzo for dinning but the Wynn for glamour. By the way, the buffet at Planet Hollywood was number 1 & has been for 5 years running. Did not like the bufft in Paris. We are not gamblers so we saw all of the the top hotels on the strip & shows everynight.

We loved every aspect of our stay. We drove to town and deposited our car with the valet and luggage with a bellman. We had reserved a Concierge level room (suite) based on many comments on Trip Advisor. A couple of days before arrival I received an email describing the check-in process. We drove to the Palazzo, left our car with the valet and our luggage with a bellman and proceeded to the 23rd floor Concierge lounge. We were greeted immediately and check-in took only a few minutes. We received the requested king bed suite on the 25th floor, which is non-smoking. We used the private elevator that runs between 23rd and 28th floors which we thought was kind of cool. Two elevators service the six concierge floors so one comes almost immediately and gives a feeling of exclusivity. Our suite, #25833 was wonderful! It smelled fresh and was spotlessly clean. It had every amenity we could want including being absolutely quite. We never heard any noise whatsoever when we were in our room which I appreciated. Our only frustration was that it took over an hour to get our luggage once the concierge called for it. I called guest services a couple of times and it finally arrived. The king bed was very comfortable and the pillows and bed linens seemed to be very high quality. Night stands and lamps were on both sides of the bed. There was a CD player with clock radio on one side and phone on the opposite night stand. On the wall across from the bed was a 42\u201d High Def flat-screen TV. Under that was a dresser with a lighted top. Next to the bed was a double-door lighted closet. On the wall between the sleeping area and sitting area were the thermostat and the remote for the blinds and black-out curtains. Our suite had a view of basically\u2026nothing of interest. Our suite faced East and the bellman suggested we close the black-out curtains if we wanted to sleep later in the morning. The sitting area had a large sectional sofa and a large coffee table. The couch was very comfortable. There was a small desk next to the couch with both wired and wireless internet connection. Because the charge was $9.95 per day I used my Verizon wireless connection instead. Next to the desk were a Brother multi-function (AIO) printer, fax, copier, and scanner. The work area seemed cramped, but we were not in Las Vegas to work. Across from the sofa were a 32\u201d flat-screen High Def TV and a standard DVD player. Some of the channels on this TV did not work, but again we were not in Vegas to watch TV so it did not matter to us. We did not report the problem. Under the TV was a mini bar, which we did not use, and an electronic safe, which we did use. Also across from the sofa was a round table and chairs with seating for three. The bathroom was very luxurious with both a deep bathtub and a glass-enclosed shower. The vanity area had dual sinks and an assortment of high quality bath amenities. Towels for three were provided and my wife commented that she liked them better than ours at home. Two resort robes were also hanging in the bathroom and a 19\u201d high-definition TV was mounted so above the vanity area. The water closet had a dual line phone We went to the Concierge lounge at about 5:30 to see what appetizers were being offered. We had not intended to make it our dinner, but the food was so good it and we ate so much of it that it was our dinner. That night food was from the Mario Batali restaurant B&B Ristorante at the Venetian next door. Service in the Concierge Lounge was very good. It was crowded, but the food was continually replenished. Mixed drinks were only served at the bar, but one of the attendants offered non-mixed drinks including wine and champagne continually. For me, the biggest benefit of paying to upgrade to the Concierge Level was coffee in the morning. Coffee and a continental breakfast were available from 6:00 AM. The continental breakfast was nicely presented and included fruit, baked goods, cold cereals, juice and croissant breakfast sandwiches. I enjoyed starting my days sitting and reading by one of the windows that overlook The Strip and enjoying three or four cups of the excellent coffee. Both my wife and I liked the Palazzo\u2019s casino. It was less smoky than others and easy to navigate with wide aisles running from side to side and end to end. You did not have to weave your way through the casino to get to the guest room elevators as in some other casinos. At the entry to the guest elevators security seemed to do a good job checking room keys helping ensure non-guests were not wandering around. My wife and I both enjoy breakfast so we ate at Grand Luxe Caf\u00e9 both mornings. For the first time ever in Las Vegas, I had a tip refused. The restaurant was full so I offered the hostess a tip for a booth. I was very surprised when we were politely told we would have a booth and a tip was unnecessary. Wow. My wife ordered a Garden Omelet both days and said it was the best omelet she ever had. I did the buffet and thought the food was excellent. Our only other dining experience was at Morels. We had a late lunch Monday and look forward to returning for dinner the next time we visit The Palazzo. The service and food at lunch were excellent, including a wonderful Vanilla Pavlova we split for desert. Morels offers a selection of specialty coffees and I really enjoyed the excellent Kenyan coffee. We used express check-out which involved filling out a card and leaving it at the Concierge desk. We had a bellman pick up our luggage when we checked out. When we left late in the afternoon we turned in the claim checks for both our car and luggage. Both arrived in about five minutes. We enjoyed our stay at The Palazzo very much. It is a beautiful hotel and the service was excellent. It may sound odd, but The Palazzo just felt very comfortable to my wife and I!", "Date": "April 12, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "New York", "Title": "\u201cExtremely Friendly Staff\u201d", "Author": "sydney8888", "ReviewID": "UR27832774", "Content": "After reading the reviews, I was apprehensive about staying here.

Check-in was fairly quick - although we had arrived at 10pm on a Tuesday night, so hardly the busiest time for check-in. We were offered an upgrade to a Bella suite for $100 a night but declined as we didn't think that we'd be spending enough time in the room to warrant nearly an extra $1000. We were offered a strip view for an extra $45 per night - which we thought would be cool so we accepted. At that point, the check-in clerk excused herself and disappeared for a few minutes. When she came back, she explained that a strip view room wasn't available for the full 9 nights so they would put us in one room for the first night, then change us to another room for the remaining 8 nights. And because of the inconvenience, the upgrade fee was waived - hooray! The strip view faced the TI, so we got a great view of the Sirens show. However, we couldn't get into our new room until about 4pm the next day. And when we arrived in our room, our luggage hadn't been moved. There was some confusion because the bellhop thought we were moving from that room and then he went to the wrong room to collect our luggage. But finally, we got our luggage and the bellhop was very pleasant - wanted to make sure we were happy with the room. Both rooms were lovely - they are fairly large, and have a contempory style. There is a nice lounge area with a huge HD TV. The bed was comfortable although a little short for my 6'3'' husband; with another 32\" HD TV. The bathroom is huge, with a separate bath and shower. There are two sinks, a dressing table and a third TV - although this one wasn't HD. The room was always cleaned to a high standard - although it wasn't cleaned one day, and another day, we had to call guest services twice to get it cleaned. There isn't a routine turn down service - but the day we had to ask for cleaning service twice, they came up quite late (after we'd left for dinner) and they provided a turn down service. Previous posts complain about the lack of the turn down service - maybe you have to request it - ? The casino had a nice relaxed feel about it - there was no frenetic buzz like you feel at other casinos. Drinks service was scarce but prompt when you got it. There are some great restaurants in the hotel, including a Mexican with the guacomole voted best on the strip (and it was delicious!). There are also some great bars - can recommend Sushisamba and the Double Helix wine bar. The pool area was really nice - there's a lot of sun beds and there are plenty of pool attendants to help you find somewhere if it's busy. Drinks service was a little scarce but there is a shop nearby where you can buy soft drinks. There is also a water dispenser available (which I didn't know about until after I bought the water - bummer!) The location was excellent - next door to the Wynn, across from the Fashion Show Mall and the TI. What was also great was that the connection to the Venetian is really close - which might sound stupid because they are next door to each other. But last time we were in Vegas, we stayed in the Signature, and it took us 15-20 mins to walk to the MGM. Whereas in the Palazzo, you just walk through the casino and you're there - 5 mins tops. Overall, we had a really lovely stay - the hotel is beautifully styled, but it has a much more relaxed pace than the Venetian. It never felt overcrowded even though there were a lot of conventions on when we were there. It was always so nice coming back to the hotel after a long day of sightseeing.

I read the Tripadvisor reviews before I booked the stay and was convinced to try the hotel. We travel alot and are very picky. We were not disappointed. We stayed in a Bella Suite and the room was absolutely beautiful. The pictures on the Palazzo website look exactly like the room! Our suite had 2 queen beds, sunken living room, 3 flat screen tv's, dvd player, etc., etc. The room is very large with plenty of space. The bathroom has french doors, double sinks, a roman tub, glass enlosed shower with body jets, a separate room for the toilet, and a vanity with a makeup mirror. I recommend: a room on the \"non-view\" side - overlooking the Wynn golf course. The view is actually spectacular, with city lights at night and mountain views during the day. It is very calm and peaceful; quite contrasting with the hustle and bustle of the strip and all the noise downstairs in the casino. When we checked in, the concierge let us know that there is construction with large cranes outside that would interfere with the upgraded Las Vegas strip view, so we stuck with the regular view and were very pleased to save about $30 a night. Later, we saw the view from the upgraded room and believed that we made the right choice because we absolutely had the better view (whether or not there were cranes). I also highly recommend: a concierge suite. It costs more per night, but it is well worth it. We had private concierge services who checked us in quickly in the concierge lounge, booked our tickets, made reservations, got us free dvd movies to watch in our room, etc. With a concierge suite there was no waiting in long lines at the main desk in the lobby to check-in or ask questions. We also had access to the concierge lounge where there is food all day - continental breakfast (pastries, fruit, yogurt, cold cereal, oatmeal, bagels, ham and cheese croissants, toast, juice, coffee, tea), afternoon snacks (cheese/crackers, chocolates), evening open bar and hors d'oeuvres (salmon, seared tuna, quiche). Throughout our stay, we ended up paying for only one meal a day, since we ate breakfast and snacks in the lounge. The lounge is expansive with sofas and flat screens throughout, a separate media room, and a private business center. There are also plenty of tables and chairs at the wall of windows overlooking the strip (particularly the Treasure Island hotel; we watched the TI show from the lounge). The hotel is in a great location right in the center of the strip. It is across the street from the Fashion Show Mall and between the Wynn and the Venetian. There is easy access to the other hotels on Las Vegas Boulevard using the Deuce bus which was $7 a day or here's a tip...use the machine outside Circus, Circus (or other locations) to purchase a $15 pass which is good for 3 days. Our best night was spent having dinner and a show - Aquaknox and Jersey Boys. Highly recommend both. Aquaknox has fabulous seafood and the Jersey Boys was an excellent show, a musical based on the life of Frankie Valli and the Four Seasons. So what was the down side? There was no coffee maker in the room (but having access to the concierge lounge made up for this). High speed internet access is $10 a day. Access to the Spa (which includes the fitness center) costs $40 per day. So, there were no workouts for us except for walking the strip. One day, they missed the turn-down service, but made up for it the next day with double chocolates. (Thus, we needed to walk the Las Vegas strip again!) Finally, it took approximately 40 minutes for the bellman to arrive after the concierge requested luggage service upon our departure for the airport. Overall, the Palazzo gets an A from me!

The coordinator booked all of us at the Palazzo. I was very pleasantly surprised by the luxuriousness of the facility and the size and elegant decor of the rooms.

Internet access was about $10 per day. I spent a total of a few hours in the casino playing only slot machines. They seemed on the tight side. When in Vegas, I have other gaming destinations I prefer. I recommend this hotel for those looking for something luxurious but are somewhat budget-limited. I might stay here in the future, but to be honest, I realized I like a hotel that is not so much 'luxie-chic'. I prefer something a little less ostentacious. I dined in a few of the on-site restaurants. I enjoyed the food in 'Morel' but found the service lacking. When a colleague joined me for lunch unexpectedly, it was apparent that it ticked off our waiter. The service really went south on a very expensive lunch.

I had researched the trip for months for my boyfriend\u2019s birthday, decided to stay at the Palazzo because it is one of the newest hotels on the strip and the rooms were large. The price was $179 per night for a Luxury suite package which included many coupons and free internet for the stay (without the package the room was $169 per night), we went Tue and Wed night. Before we arrived I spoke with Stella to let her know it was his birthday and I would like to request early check in (since we arrived at 11) and a room with a strip view, she said this would be fine and since I booked through the hotel they could accommodate this for me. This was the first out of many lies from this hotel. The Front Desk Nightmare: Checking into this hotel was one of my worst experiences ever. Please note, I travel about 4 times a year so I know what to expect, CUSTOMER SERVICE that is! The lady who checked me in informed me that the room we booked would not be ready until 3:00 pm, and it faces the \"back of the Wynn. She then went on to say if we would like to upgrade to a view suite those rooms are ready right away, and would be $45 extra per night. However, I had the print out from online of all the prices and what my package included, and the price said to upgrade to a Luxury \"View\" suite was only $30.00 per night. I showed this to her, and she said they would not honor that price; prices are different online than at the hotel. I didn't want to fight with her since it was my boyfriend\u2019s birthday, so I paid the $45 dollars per night, grabbed my coupons and we went to the room (No help offered with our luggage). When we arrived to our room, the view was spectacular; we had a view of TI, Mirage, and the pools at the Palazzo. I then took out my lap top and realized they did not give me the code for me to sign in (since my package included free internet). I called down to ask for the code and a lady name Lisa answered. She told me that I did not have a package that allowed for free internet. Once again I had to argue with her, I had the print out in front of me from the online website that showed what I purchased. She argued with me, she was very condescending and rude, I couldn't believe how I was being talked to when I am paying now $224 per night to stay in this room. Finally, after I asked to speak to her manager, she said she would credit me the internet and gave me the code. I than asked about the $45 upgrade charge, telling her it was supposed to be $30, she also argued about this, I asked to speak with the Manager, she connected me with some guy named Jonathan, who was worse than Lisa and was NOT the manager. Then they connected me to Sumiko, who they claimed to be the front desk manager, she finally told me that they would only charge me $30.00 per night for the upgrade charge after about 1 hour of arguing. I want to say it wasn't about a stupid $15 dollars per night, but it was about the ethic of them posting one price, charging me another, and then arguing with me, I felt as a customer I should have been treated much better. Let\u2019s move on to the room: The room was FILTHY, finger prints over everything, I read the reviews prior and saw this and thought the people were just being picky, but they are not, the rooms are not clean. The shower had a chunk of someone\u2019s hair built up in the corner, I wanted to vomit. The rooms are 720 sqft, but still don't seem very large, the Mirage Suite was 1200 and seemed 3 times bigger. Bring a feather pillow to sleep on because theirs are harder than a rock. The blankets are feather, which was nice. There was little sound proofing in the bathrooms, I heard everything our neighbors were doing which was annoying. Casino: Casino was large, a lot of restaurants which was very nice, most are open until 1:00 am, since the Venetian is attached to this hotel you can walk over there easily and eat. We ate at Tao, it was pretty good, fairly priced. More horrible customer service at check out: We checked out on Thursday at 10 am, we had to catch our flight at 11:30 am. We get to the front desk and they have a print out of over $500 dollar charges to our room. First, they charged me $45 per night for the upgrade (not $30 like promised). They charged me $10 dollars per day for internet, not free like promised. They then charged us about 100 in other refreshment fees which we did not eat or drink anything from the fridge, all we did was move around stuff so we could fit our own personally bought sodas from Walgreens in the fridge. It was an argument all over again. The check out lady told me that the manager would not do anything about this for me and the charges were set in stone. That is when I just said NO! I was not doing this again and not missing my flight because of them. Once again after another 30 minutes of arguing with me, they said they would \"take care\" of it and send me a receipt. Hello! I am not dumb, I said no you print one out now. She than told me my new charge was $260, I said to break it down for me, and she goes \"opps\" I forgot to take off the internet\" Let\u2019s just say WOW.

When we inspected the room, there was something really gross on the white comforter. We were moved to another room on the 32nd floor. This time the bathroom had something really gross on the toilet. Not to mention there we still crumbs on the living room table and tons of fingerprints all over the picture windows. Both rooms had multiple stains on the velor furniture. The floors were not carpet swept. It was too late and they were at full occupancy, so we had to stay in that room for the night. The housekeeping crew came and cleaned the bathroom. We requested a CLEAN room, any size, no matter how small, we just wanted what you could expect at any HAMPTON INN, a clean room.

A hint for getting to the hotel. If you go by taxi make sure to tell the driver to stay off the interstate. We did this on the return trip to the airport and saved about $10 A hint for getting up and down the strip: I have been to Vegas a couple of time and found that if you take the Deuce double decker city bus, you will have a VERY hard time getting on in the evening. When the bus gets to the stop you are waiting at, the bus is already full and will not take on any new passengers. (They have a security guard on the bus to control angry people) Meanwhile at your bus stop there are 30 people waiting to get on. As time passes, more and more people start waiting. And, it also doesn't matter who is at the bus stop first. Where the bus stops, those are the people (the 5 or so they take) who are allowed to get on whether they were there 1 minute or 40.. The first time I was in Vegas I learned these tips about the Deuce and it wasn't so bad after that.

The desk clerk would never give my wife a direct answer for the cost of the upgrade, only saying it would cost $100. After considerable questioning, she then advised us it was an extra $100 per night for only \"$300.\" We then had to extract that this was incremental to what was already paid for the original reservation, and there was no response when I told her that her newly quoted charges were more than what was offerred online. The rooms are nice size and well appointed, although the furniture is already starting to show some wear. There is a \"master lights on/off\" switch when you enter the suite, and it sounds like you're throwing a circuit breaker and shutting the place down.

Seeming annoyed with my stupidity, she offered to send someone to the room. After waiting 15 minutes, I called again. This clerk told me again where to find the switch, to which I said it didn't exist. She confirmed that maintenance was on the way, but wanted me to check for the switch one more time! Continuing to wait, I tried to reach behind the shades to unscrew the light bulbs, but only burned my fingers. The guy eventually came and told us that all rooms had these lights, and they have been converting them to ones with switches, but this one must have been missed.

Got a great price on a room with access to the Concierge Lounge which was well worth the extra money. Check in was simple and was quickly assigned a room on the 22nd floor with views of the Wynn Hotel. Like most strip hotels you have to walk through the casino, but it's at least a straight line and it's not too far, unlike the New York New York hotel which we've stayed in before which can be a nightmare to navigate with suitcases when it's busy. The room was unlike anything else we'd stayed in before. If you're not impressed by the suite then you're extremely hard to please. We're not wealthy by any means but enjoy staying at moderate to higher priced hotels when on holiday, but this room was unlike anything we'd ever experienced before. It was truly amazing, from the comfortable king sized bed, 2 42\" HD plasma's (with a 3rd slightly smaller one in the bathroom!), sunken lounge, dining table, great shower, the room was just spectacular. We could have stayed in it the whole 4 days and still had a great Vegas vacation! Concierge floor was great, good breakfast, free drinks, great view of the strip, good food, great staff, loved it. We ate at Morel's Steakhouse, one of the best meals we've ever had, i had a fantastic steak, not cheap but a very worthwhile splurge meal. My girlfriend had the Maine Lobster and she also raved about it. Also ate at Grand Lux Cafe which was also excellent, fantastic huge meals at a great price. I can't say enough great things about this hotel, next time we're in Vegas without doubt this will be the hotel we choose.

Pedicure at the spa was a little pricey for the average person, but Miriam is exceptional and made it worth it with her pressure point foot massage. Bottom Line: Palazzo is adding new construction, including villas. The hotel is a little over a year old, I believe. My recommendation would be that they ensure they have a strong maintenance and staff training program. Could already see the chipped marble, the cracked mirrors, the damaged coffee table...

I was excited because the online photos, and amenities seem impressive for the special price they were offering. I immediately booked online for my birthday. A few days later we decided to look at prices at the Venetian realized that they had a great rate also and called on the phone to book one night (just for the experience). We decided to request the same package they were offering at the Palazzo and was told by the reservation agent that it was not available as displayed online. So to prove our point we asked them to check the reservation I booked online for the Palazzo. To our greatest surprise they claimed we did not have one and that package and price did not exist at the Palazzo. The package was (VIP admission to Club LAVO and $50.00 drink credit, $50.00 gaming credit). They were quoting us a higher price and a different package. At that time I did not have the reservation number with me. Once I obtained it we called back and gave it to them and then they mysteriously found the reservation. All was well\u2026 or so we thought. A few weeks later I wanted to upgrade on my birthday reservation and called to ask a few questions. Once again they could not find our Palazzo reservation. I gave them the reservation number and they said I booked that date at the Venetian and the rate I claimed to have did not exist even though we had a reservation confirmation email with the price. After staying on the phone for approximately 20 minutes while they sort things out the reservation agent mentioned she fixed the problem and gave us what we requested. I asked for the confirmation number and she said it was the same. Our reservation at the Venetian was before the Palazzo one so during our stay the Venetian we called to extend a day on the upcoming Palazzo reservation only to find out again that our reservation did not exist there. We had to rebook and request our package and rate once again. We were told that all was well. Check-in was fast but not smooth. There were no lines and our room was ready even though we were early. Upon checking in we were unable to get our package because the front desk agent said that the package I wanted was not listed on the reservation. So we received only credits for the casino. Would you believe after all that we still did not get what we were promised? We really wanted to get the VIP passes for the Club LAVO for my birthday, but did not. Room: Similar set up as the Venetian. Spacious but not private it had studio effect. Big bathroom with separate shower, tub and private toilet. I was a bit disappointing because after staying at the Venetian I expected the room d\u00e9cor to be a bit nicer. The couch was a dreary brown color which made the room feel a bit depressing (only because I was comparing it to the Venetian). The towels were dirty, so I took two clean ones from the housekeeper's cart in the hallway. Bed was comfy but not as comfy as the Venetian. The sink was clogged a bit and filled up when we went to brush our teeth. We pumped it a bit and was able to get it functioning again. The small fridge/bar had a sensor on it so of course we could not store our juice or snack in it. I surely didn't want to be charged for something I did not take. Casino: The lines for the Grazie Club(casino club) was a killer. I waited in line for 45 mins to get my gaming credit on my players card, only to find out that none of the cards worked. I went back in line for 20 mins to redo them. After 1 hour of playing my card quit working. I decided to wait till next day to try the line. Same thing happened again. I was so frustrated with those cards. During my 3 day stay in the casino only once a server passed by and I asked her for a drink. She said that I was not playing the machine so she could not give it to me. I actually was trying to play the machine but the buttons kept sticking so I took my money out and was waiting for my mate to finish on his machine for us to move to another. So in order to get the drink I put my money back into the machine and struggled with the sticking button.... Only to hit a small jackpot. Not once but three times on that machine. (1 cent slot). She finally came with the drink and never to be seen again. The only thing is I hit the jackpots after the walked away and I didn't see her to thank her for forcing me to play the machine for a drink. LOL Restaurant: The food at the Italian restaurant downstairs (Del Toro, if I'm not mistaken) was not tasty, neither the waiters nor waitresses were polite. The manager however was attentive in an attempt to make up for the incompetent staff. I enjoy eating at The Grand Lux Cafe. Food portion, price and service were all wonderful each time we went there. All in all I would recommend the hotel for anyone who wants to experience Vegas and the Palazzo. The rate with the packages were rewarding (if you are lucky to have them honor them). The lobby decor is beautiful and there are lots to do. The atmosphere however is a bit impersonal and impolite. I guess it's because of the size of the hotel and as it was around the New Year, lots were going on, so maybe they were overwhelmed.

It was a great suite with it's own media room, pool table and grand piano so it made the first night special! Late the following morning, we contacted the front desk as instructed to let them know we were ready to be moved and were wisked away from the plush digs to a suite overlooking the strip several floors below at the very end of an extremely lengthy hall. We called down to request that we move closer to an elevator. Out of 3,000 rooms, they didn't have anything like that ready but had a room with a view of the Wynn Hotel and its golf course. As that was the view from the first night's suite, we accepted that and headed for the room only to find that it was not facing the Wynn, but all the construction going on beside the Venetian. So..........we contacted the front desk again and they had a bellman come to move our luggage to a room that was being cleaned that we could have when finished. Therefore, all our luggage was placed in the closet in that room and we stayed in the other suite waiting for a phone call to say it was ready for occupancy. Over an hour later I took a walk down to the suite to see how the housekeeping staff was coming along. There was no one cleaning that room and it was occupied by a young couple who had just checked in! And, yes, our luggage was in the closet. Thankfully they hadn't been in the room long enough to realize the luggage was there but were stunned as I was to think the hotel could make such a mistake. Needless to say, we were assigned to another suite which was the 5th suite within a 24-hour period. We finally got to unpack our luggage about 5:00 p.m. on Monday, 1/19. What a nightmare! I truly believe they could have done better than that with the total number of rooms they have. Apparently the Intel convention was on site per the bellmen that helped us. We feel that the management was making the big guys happy at the expense of the everyday traveler. All the staff seemed to be quite pleasant which helped to make a horrible situation more bearable.

The place is lovely, the suites are big and comfortable, tastefully appointed, and include all the amenities you'd expect in this price range. The view from our 39th-floor window was very nice. However, as stated in some prior reviews, it takes a very long time for anyone to pick up the phone at the front desk. This led to our dry cleaning not being picked up until shortly after 9:00 a.m.--the \"deadline\" for same day service. (We needed the clothing Saturday night.) I was specifically told that it wouldn't have to be an \"express\" regardless of this, and we would have it back that evening. Of course, it wasn't delivered that evening, and when I called the next day, I was told it wouldn't even be back until the following day--Sunday. So \"In By 9:00/Same Day\" just isn't. It sounds like \"Express\" might actually mean the next day, in reality. To the hotel's credit, we received the clothing around noon on Saturday and they took the charge off our bill--but I had to make a fuss and absolutely demand the clothes for our event that night and it was upsetting. Regarding the phones: The desk phone didn't work at all, and the cordless phone on the bedside stand didn't work every time. (I never tried the water closet phone.) Also, I believe soemone else mentioned having trouble with the remote draperies. The sheer Roman drop shades worked perfectly, but the pull drapes didn't respond to the remote without several tries. In addition, there was a pull missing from the mini-fridge cabinet. This should not be so in a hotel on this caliber, in my opinion--basic room maintenance should be better than that. We were going to open a split of Chardonnay from the mini-fridge, and we took it out only to discover there was no cork pull in the room. We put the Chardonnay right back, and pulled out the Champagne instead, (you don't need a pull for that one. ;-). Well, of course we were charged for both, and I had to call about that, too. (I'm a little mystified as to how they knew we intended to drink the Chardonnay, but maybe I don't want to know that...) The Spa is nice--my manicure started and finished right as scheduled. Our Friday night dinner at B&B (Batali & Bastianich), was utterly superlative.

The Canyon Ranch Spa disappointed me on my last stay at the Venetian. Although it has been renovated, it still does not look or feel like a world-class spa, more like a massage factory. There are many restaurants to choose from- some great, others disappointing. The Grand Lux Cafe is really good and not overly expensive. The Mexican restaurant was so-so, and Carne Vino, a Mario Battali-owned eatery (one of several on the property) was good but very pricey.

Also, I have read in both past reviews and travel publications that the bathroom showers have multiple shower jets; this was not the case in our room. Perhaps they are only in higher category rooms, or are being retrofitted. The \"turndown service\" consisted only of chocolates on our pillow, it did not appear there was any effort to tidy the room up a bit.

Loud knocking sound coming from the bathroom plumbing that interrupted our sleep both nights. Called front desk repeatedly and no one ever answered. Casino: we were in the casino both days of our stay for approximately five hours total. Approached once by a server for drinks. Slot machine malfunctioned.

Spa: Uninterested attendants left us wondering what the spa had to offer. Finally managed to make an appointment after waiting 15 minutes. Spa was a let down and vastly overpriced. Restaurants: Ate at five to six outlets at the hotel. Service was painfully slow, bumbling, didn't always get what we ordered, and all were obviously understaffed even though there was no crush of people at these restaurants. Bell stand: not offered assistance upon departure. The bell staff stand around a lot. When we needed tape for a box, we were told by both the front desk and bell staff that we would have to walk over to the business center at the Venetian with our box to pay for tape for our box. Front desk: It would be nice if they actually picked up the phone when they are called. Upon check-out we informed the front desk of numerous service lapses. They did not adequately address them.

I almost didn't want to write good review because then people may start going there more, driving the price up. Anyhow, I got pretty good deal staying there this December. I went there with my husband for a romantic gataway. I remember the most horrible trip ever in Vegas with my soon-to be husband 2 years ago (stayed in cheep hotel Riviera, ending up to be kicked out 2nd night after midnight -Riviera forged my husband's signature to be \"volunterry check out\" we assume that they got some big group coming in and decided to make room for them) Anyhow, so this time I wanted things to be right, and I made a good choice. I had never stayed good hotel in Vegas, but my husband had stayed in basic room in Bellagio, and penthouse suite in Bellagio. We both agree, with the price we paid, I wonder what hotel can beat Palazzo. We loved everything. The basic room which is suites already, is fantastic. I could live there. We got room \"without view\" but, it actually has a beautiful view of mountain desert with towns, it just is not facing to the strip. We liked it better because it is more relaxing. The other reviewer said that door was too heavy, but I didn't feel that way at all. I thought to have good door for private toilet area in the bathroom was actually great. Bathroom had beautiful double doors opening into a little marble tiled hallway -very spacious. And yes, all the amenities written to be there, is there in the bathroom. double sink, big tub, separate shower, and makeup vanity with cute chair. But what I didn't know was how great this room was in details. Bathrooom had two lights, it could control mood/romantic to more bright setting. The little bar/cabinet in the bedroom had marble tile which can be set to have this beautiful light underneath, adding the romantic feel during the night. closet light automatically comes up when you open, turns of when you close. When you leave/enter the room, you only need to turn off/on master light at near entrance anyway you like it. Hotel itself was very clean, and does have little fragrance in the air, but it was very nice. I don't like fragrance to begin with so it didn't bother me, most people wouldn't. the ventilation was good also, I HATE smoke-but when I'm walking into the Palazzo, I hardly smelled smoke. The decor is modern and classy, not as flashy as Venetian, we loved the relaxing atmosphere of the entire hotel. One of the reason I picked Palazzo was because it has Canyon Ranch Spa Club, with $40 a day(if you purchase $29 resort package you can get same pass with more stuff), you can access all the fitness classes and huge, I mean huge spa area. And yes, there is everything that said to be there is there. Additionally, co-ed conservatory is HUGE ! and there is very nice reading/nap area which is individually separated with curtain in both women, and men's section. I honestly could spend few days without stepping outside of it. My husband is NOT spa kind of guy, but we ended up spending at least 4 hours, and made him want to get massage and stay longer. Also the great surprise was Canyon Ranch Cafe Grill- very healthy selection with great quality food, and tastes great. My husband had owned a restaurant, worked with many cafes, was impressed. He was complaining earlier why he couldn't get even a decent coffee in Vegas, and there it was. The coffee itself pleased him-he said that even has \"truffle overtone\". We went back the grill for another breakfast-oh it was also VERY reasonably priced as well. Next time I will be in Palazzo, I'm sure at least one meal everyday, we'll have it there. Speaking of restaurant, yes I feel that everything is Vegas is pretty much overpriced, which was same in Palazzo, but compare to Bellagio-it was much better. Also in Palazzo/Venetian has so many many more restaurants, and I was surprised how good these are. We knew many great restaurant from LA area, and many of them were located at Palazzo. We can just try all without driving in LA traffic. great. One meal we tried to have it at Bellagio, more overpriced, and super crowded, not many restaurants were there anyway...we ended up getting crappy food at high cost. Next time I will stick with the restaurant in Palazzo-there were so many of them to begin with and I didn't need to make reservation nor to wait. The services were great except one of the cafe Tintoretto Bakery looked good but everything was bad including coffee. Espressamente Illy was over priced (coffee place, you pay extra to have espresso in ceramic cup, what!?-go Canyon Ranch Cafe Grill for a coffee and freshly baked scone with super tasty peanut butter and yogurt creme on the side). Sushisamba had interesting menu, and for fusion themed sushi place, the suchi WAS good. the sushi set actually contained some interesting fish and in good quality. We ordered fresh grated wasabi for $2 on the side, it was very good although we know it was not grated with shark skin as we usually like it. I recommend shrimp chevice, very creative, and good. Dal Toro Ristorante was ok. just for atmosphere, then I couldn't see cars while eating anyways. Pinot was excellent, wow, but for onion soup $14 ? why ? And oysters were good yet really really tiny... humm.. but I may have to go back because of the quality is really good. After all quality is more important than quantity for me. Endive salad was really really good. I could eat a mountain of it. Woo was just good- we had to wait loong time for just lunch, but food was creative and good. I just didn't understand fried calamari, why do we have cinamon for seafood? After one bite I forgot that I was eating calamari.....it could be anything in there with so much cinamon on it. I wish everything was a tad cheaper. Now I noticed some of the restaurant I mentioned was in Venetian, but it is good thing about Palazzo, is connected to Venetian so seemlessly, You actually have much more choice of food and shopping without much walking. I can keep going on and on...but I should stop here. I'm definately going back to Palazzo soon.", "Date": "December 26, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "2", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "2", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "charleston", "Title": "\u201cTop Bottom\u201d", "Author": "monamigabi", "ReviewID": "UR22991605", "Content": "The trip was intended to serve as a birthday present for my girlfriend.

Im not quite sure what they were doing in there but it certainly wasnt cleaning or maintaining the fixtures and fittings. When we finally got access to the room we had to play a game of 'how does it all work?' because there was no information at all about anything in the room including the jet engine room air conditioning that never stops and the t.v.'s. Even after repeated requests nothing materialised. Maybe it's a secret. Next up was the magical t.v. cabinet doors which were held on by......... nothing. As a result when i tried to open them to access the safe they fell off. Onto me. And they are heavy. 4 of the lights in the room didnt work and again after phoning down a number of times nothing was done. Is it me, or would you rather have a t.v. in the bathroom and a telephone in the toilet or coffee making facilities? According to the front desk an electric kettle is a fire hazard and therefore 'ILLEGAL in Las Vegas hotels.' Im a firefighter, have been for ten years and ive never put out a kettle. Call me a cynic but i would suggest the last thing they want you to do is make yourself a coffee when you can phone down and order one for 13 dollars. Take your own kettle. Believe me, you will thank me for this. Now, i'm not an expert but i have to say this hotel was a fairly good representation of Vegas. On the surface it looks great but whatever you do, dont give it close inspection. That beautiful Italian furniture is chipboard. And its dirty. Oh, and just in case they dont tell you, because they wont. Dont lift that bottle of wine out of the mini bar to see what year it is because it will be on your bill faster than you can say 'mini bar scam' even if you put it back unopened. What got me down amidst all this was the complete indifference shown by any of the staff. Im sure they are all sweetness and light when your telling them what a nice time your having and they're scouting for a tip but when the chips were down, so to speak, they really couldn't have cared less. I liked Vegas a lot, it was an exciting place but when i come back it wont be to the Palazzo hotel. Your not a guest, your a form of prey.

Our suite had a wonderful view of the Wynn golf course and waterfall. The mountains were nice to look at as well. We spent most of our time in the Palazzo property--which we had not intended to do. The places to eat were a little more expensive than we had expected, but the food was amazing and well worth it. We dined at Table 10, Morels (twice!), Restaraunt Charlie's, the neighboring food court twice, the gelatto shop, and had dessert at the Double Helix bar. All was wonderful and we wanted to try other places! The rooms are simply amazing. Tons of room to stretch out (which turned out to be a good thing when I injured my foot half way through the trip), THREE TV sets (including one in the bathroom), really comfortable bedding, and very tasteful furnishings. The room was spotless and housekeeping kept everything that way! The turndown service was a nice touch. The spa.....WOW! I spend a few hours every day at the Canyon Ranch Spa. Working out and enjoying the spa facilities. If you have the opportunity to have a massage (it's not cheap) ask for Gaberiel. He found knots and sore muscles I didn't even know I had.

Each of us agreed that this is THE best hotel experience we've had in comparison to the dozens of trips to Vegas over the years. Room - My favorite aspect of the hotel is the room configuration and decor. The standard rooms at Palazzo (like Venetian) are huge. Large, well-appointed bathroom with a jet tub, separate shower, enclosed toilet, double vanity and TV. Then there is a sleeping area containing beds, TV and dressser. Lastly, the sunken living space contains a sectional sofa, desk area, TV and mini bar. One roommate could be watching TV without disturbing the sleepers. For me, the new, beautiful decor at Palazzo put this hotel over Venetian which used to be my #1. I enjoyed the balance of the 'hi-tech' features (flat-panel TVs and remote-controlled window coverings) in combination with the modern-classic-luxurious furnishings. Turn-down service and morning newspaper are nice touches. Layout - The hotel is well-laid out. Very spacious everywhere, even in the casino. Parking elevator is right next to the hotel elevators so there's no need to maneuver through crowds or haul luggage a long way to get to your car. We hardly ever waited for an elevator. Coffee bar right at the base of the elevators. Service - Employees were so accommodating, efficient and polite thoughout the hotel - reception, housekeeping, Carnevino restaurant and casino dealers. In nice contrast to our last trip at the Wynn where we experienced some service problems and attitude. Location - Connected to Venetian and close proximity to many other nice hotels. Very walkable. The only downside was that the gym pass was a bit expensive ($40 per day). A couple of dining highlights during my trip (one of my favorite hobbies): - Enjoyed a late supper at Firefly (off the strip) which serves delicious Spanish tapas at very reasonable prices. - Also, loved the burgers at Bradley Ogden (bar/lounge area) in Caesar's Palace.

The first is that it is unnecessary to drive on \u2018The Strip\u2019 portion of Las Vegas Blvd (often a \"parking lot\") to enter/exit the hotel by auto. From the east, drive on Tropicana (or other parallel streets), take a right on Korval to a left on Sands Ave, then a left into the underground parking entrance. If driving from South LV Blvd, take a right at Mandalay Bay and follow the left and right curving main road until it becomes Korval and then on to Sands. From the west and from I-15, use Exit 39 and turn east on Spring Mountain Rd/Vegas Plaza Dr, cross The Strip and it becomes Sands, then right into the parking entrance. If using a taxi from the airport, don't let the driver talk you into the \"quickest way\", which of course is the 'longest way' (via the tunnel, I-215 and I-15) and will cost \u00b1$25. And don't let them take you via Tropicana all the way to The Strip. Tell the driver to use the Tropicana/Korval route to the hotel. It should be little more than half as much. The second plus is that self-parking is easier and quicker than Valet; and it does not have-to involve walking through the casino. There are two banks of elevators from the parking levels up to the hotel. The western bank requires crossing the casino. The eastern bank is not only \u2018around-the-corner\u2019 from the room elevators; but the elevators also go up to both the casino (C) level and also to the 2nd floor.

Besides these design elements the room was filthy and full of issues - it was so dusty that I could write the word DUST on every surface, there were hairs and other bits of junk all over, the inside of the window was covered in hand prints, the mirror in the bath was covered in water spots as were the sink fixtures, the little bottle of free lotion had cracked and leaked all over the counter, the carpet was not vacuumed, the wall behind the heating unit had been removed and not repaired correctly, there was a huge chunk of damage near the floor in the entry and worst of all there was an exposed carpet tack in front of the closet that stabbed me in my foot when I had the misfortune to step on it. I called maintenance about the tack but no one ever came to fix it and we finally just put a shoe over that spot in the carpet and went on with our vacation - but I was reminded of the tack with every step for the next three days. My previous two stays at this hotel were so terriffic that I was painfully suprised by the stark contrast of this room. For a five star hotel with five star prices I expect a five star experience, but the problems with this room seem like something I would encounter in a $39 a night room at the 30 year old Imperial Palace, not a $200 a night room at the 1 year old Palazzo. My other two stays at Palazzo were so great that I thought I had found my new home in Las Vegas for my 6+ trips per year but now I will be looking for somewhere new. Please look at my photos to see the problems I have described, and feel free to contact me about my disappointing stay.", "Date": "December 1, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Los Angeles, California", "Title": "\u201cPalazzo Made Las Vegas Special\u201d", "Author": "asianam", "ReviewID": "UR22233622", "Content": "My 87 year old mother and I stayed at Palazzo Nov.23 and 24 in a room with 2 queen beds.

Small line at check in and was greeted by name. Immediately offered numerous upgrades, which I declined. I then asked for a high floor room, but was told the highest I could go was the 8th floor. I had a feeling the clerk was trying to push me back into taking an upgrade. I stuck with my room on the 8th floor. Having stayed at the Venezia a few years back, I can say without doubt these are the nicest rooms I've ever stayed in. Especially at entry level suite standard. Large, split level, suites Separate shower, tub and toilet areas 3 plasma/LCD televisions Wet bar with additional Snack Center DVD player and Ipod Alarm Clock/Radio Luxurious toiletries Bathrobes and Slippers Wireless Internet with Fax/Copier/Printer Remote control Roman blinds and Drapes Evening turn-down service, with chocolates on pillow, ice bucket refreshed, bins emptied and toiletries and towels refreshed. You will not find larger rooms anywhere on the Strip at this level. Not even at the Wynn or Bellagio. The decor of the Palazzo is classy and understated in comparison to the somewhat excessive detailing of the Venetian. The casino has specific non smoking areas and generally it felt less smokier than the Venetian. I never returned to my room smelling of smoke. Problems: There were 5 ceiling lights throughout the suite that needed replacing. Housekeeping clearly doesn't monitor the lighting within the room and report it. I had to phone down and have the lights replaced myself. Perhaps it's me, but the room feels dark, even with all the lights switched on. I would prefer increased or brighter lighting in the rooms. On the second day of my stay I decided to have some candy from Snack Center. I happily watched TV eating my chocolate, only to glance at the bottom of the box to find a best buy date of October 2008. I immediately called the Refreshment Center to complain that stock inside the Snack Center was not being checked, and that my purchase was out of date. The fact is, if people don't buy these products, they can potentially be there for a very long time. Later that day they replaced all the stock inside my Snack Center and removed the charge for the candy from my bill. On the third day of my stay I returned to my suite at 4pm to discover that it hadn't been cleaned. I had to call down to Housekeeping and have someone sent up. I left the room at 8am and didn't have a 'Privacy' tag on my door. There was no reason or excuse given for the room not being cleaned. On the Fourth day, I returned to my room to discover torn linen on my bed. No big deal, as it was clean, which was the most important thing. However, in a 5 Star resort like the Palazzo, you should not have to see torn linen on your bed. It was clearly visible to me, so Housekeeping should have spotted it. In summary, the Palazzo is a beautiful hotel that aspires to offer the very best on the Strip. The rooms and general decor of the hotel is of an exceptional quality. However, the quality of service in some areas, as well as attention to detail is still lacking. There are definite areas for improvement, as it's the little details that can sometimes make or break a visit. Overall I've very much enjoyed my stay and would gladly return. However, a letter will be sent to management to give constructive feedback.", "Date": "November 26, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Nevada", "Title": "\u201cAwesome!\u201d", "Author": "reuhl925", "ReviewID": "UR22156899", "Content": "Wow!

The rooms are beautiful; you do see wear and tear; and who hasn't had something new scratched or damaged in your own home. The smell piped in reminds me of fresh rain and while it did seem a little much at first we got use to it quickly. Something to keep in mind if you have a sensitivity. The rooms have been described well by other reviewers; one surprise to me was the lack of a hairdryer; there's a bathroom scale; lighted make up mirror that you can move to see the back of you. The closet is quite small if you want to hang things and stash your suitcases. Our view on the 36th floor was of the Wynn, golf course and pools which was very relaxing to look at. The location is very convenient to the Fashion Show Mall and I would say it is quieter; didn't notice the loud, drink in hand, fun loving people at this end of the strip. The Jersey Boys were amazing; a very talented cast. We shared the inside gondola ride with another couple; our gondolier was very entertaining and a talented singer as well; not all sing. The inside ride is to going to look the same whether you take it early in the day or late. We had all our meals at the hotel, excellent service everywhere. The prices are high; but this is a very high end hotel. I noticed a small foodcourt in the Venetian side. The Grand Lux had reasonable prices; except for coffee $3.75 seemed high (it was good but not a fancy Starbuck's one). The portions were generous; I was disappointed in the very boring hash browns at breakfast and the lack of fresh fruit on the menu. Our other meals were early suppers in the lounges. At Lavo we had wine ($14 a glass) and pizza; excellent. At Moreles the restaurant did not open until 5pm; so we opted for incredible burgers in the lounge ($16 each). We didn't have time to use the pools but we did go down and pick up a coffee (eek $4.00) and wandered about the pools before we checked out. They looked lovely and the hot tub area was very inviting. The turn down service left chocolates and replaced the used vanity towerls. Both check in and out had no line ups; but I did notice at certain times when we walked by that there were lines. On check out they arranged our boarding passes. When I went to pick up my $25 casino card that came with our package; you do have to sign up for the GRazie club to get it. The women noticed my birthday and presented me with a gift! We are not gamblers; but had great fun at the one cent slots (if you play all the lines at one cent it costs less than .25 for each pull and I played for a couple of hours before I lost my $25). It took some time before the cocktail waitress came by; but she did return quickly on the second round. To be honest I barely heard her ask if anyone wanted drinks; so I may have easily missed her going by earlier. The cab from the airport was $30 to the hotel; and $20 on the return which made me wonder if the first cab took his own way. About $14 each way to the downtown factory outlets. The outlet info center will try to sell you a $5 coupon book; be sure to take a good look, as not all the stores offer savings; or you may have to spend $100 to receive 10%off at some stores. If you need teenaged gifts - Armani Exchange has good prices on t-shirts. I've been spoiled by the Palazzo and might find it hard to stay elsewhere. It had been a toss up between the Bellagio and Palazzo; the Palazzo had amazing rates which is why I initially chose it; I now know I made the right choice for me.", "Date": "November 24, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Pleasant Prairie, Wisconsin", "Title": "\u201cPerfect Stay at The Palazzo!\u201d", "Author": "amblush", "ReviewID": "UR22059386", "Content": "We stayed at The Palazzo November 17-19th to celebrate our anniversary. We were second in line at check-in when we arrived at about 3:30 pm. We were informed that they no longer had our room type which was a Luxury Suite so we were assigned a Bella Suite instead. A $100 incidentals hold was put on our credit card. You have the choice of either giving a cash deposit of $100 or allowing a credit card hold. The hold was removed upon check-out since we didn't charge anything to our room. We were given a room on the 33rd floor with a view of the Wynn and part of Las Vegas Blvd. (see photos). Our room had a flat screen t.v., two comfortable queen beds and an alarm clock radio in the bedroom area and an iron w/ironing board in the closet. In the lviing room area we had a sectional couch, coffee table, dinette table w/3 chairs, desk w/printer/fax/internet access, mini bar, flat screen t.v. and remote controlled drapes/shade. You may request a mini-refrigerator and one will be delivered to your room shortly after check-in. The bathroom had a glass enclosed shower, large tub, two sinks, a vanity and separate room w/door for the toilet. The toiletries were Lemon Verbena Scented Agraria of San Francisco and included: bath salts, shampoo, conditioner, lotion, bath & shower gel, bar soap, facial soap and loofah. Also provided was a small travel kit which included: a sewing kit, hair band, nail file, cuticle pusher, make-up pads and a shower cap.Two plush robes were provided and are available for purchase with The Palazzo logo through guest services. We tipped housekeeping $5/day and were provided with extra towels and toiletries. At night the turn down service puts nice chocolates on the beds. The Palazzo is a beautiful property and it's very convenient to navigate. The casino is very open and has a relaxing decor. Just around the corner from the guest elevators is a coffee shop called The Coffee Bean & Tea Leaf. A large latte is about $5. If you go a bit further around the corner from the guest room elevators you'll arrive at the parking garage elevators. Parking is abundant in the garage. The Palazzo and Venetian both pump a fragrance into their casinos to (I assume) mask the smell of cigarette smoke. The fragrance was a little off putting this time but after about 10 minutes we didn't notice it anymore. There was no fragrance at all in our room. Right off of the casino floor is a casual restaurant called The Grand Lux with pretty good food. Dinner entrees ran about $14.99 to $25.99 and cocktails were $11-$14. The Jersey Boys theater is right around the corner from The Grand Lux. We saw Jersey Boys on a Tuesday night and loved it. Be aware that profanity is used in this show quite a bit in the beginning. They call it authentic New Jersey language. We had seats in the mezzanine, section 10, row BB. A railing and handicapped seats blocked my view of the entire right side of the stage. We politely asked to be moved and were given seats in a better area with a perfect view. This show is wonderful and the singing is perfect! To access The Venetian you have three routes to choose from. The first is through the lobby towards the Sands Expo and keep to the right when you get near The Blue Man Group ticket counter. This will take you directly into The Venetian's casino. The second route is through Grand Canal Shoppes. Take the escalator right off of The Palazzo casino floor up to the Grand Canal Shoppes and follow it around. The third is to exit The Palazzo via the lobby onto Las Vegas Blvd and walk down to The Venetian. Pedestrian bridges will lead you across to The Wynn and another crosses from The Wynn over to Fashion Show Mall. To cross over to Treasure Island or The Mirage you can access the pedestrian bridge that is in front of The Venetian. Our stay was very relaxing and enjoyable. The Palazzo is clean and elegant. Every employee that we came into contact with was very polite and accomodating. We have also stayed at The Venetian which was a wonderful experience but we now prefer The Palazzo.

The yellow lighting is good for the bedroom, not for a casino floor. Coffee please! 3. No poker room. 4. It seems that for every 2 or 3 really friendly staff you find on the casino floor or the hotel desk, you get 1 that is just a jerk. Maybe it is still a new place and need to weed out those jerks, but definitely not as friendly of a place as the Wynn (all smiles and friendly conversations). Need to up a notch there. Positives: 1. Best room I have ever stayed. 3 plasmas in the suite. 2. Close to Wynn and connected to Venetian. For the same amount of money, you should stay at the Venetian.

We stayed there for six days at the end of October 2008 and we enjoyed much of our stay. We did have a number of problems which were VERY annoying at the beginning of our stay which really set the tone for the rest of it unfortunately. To begin with, we booked the \"concierge level\" suite, which is advertised as \"free breakfast, afternoon hors d'eouvres, and evening cocktails and appetizers every day. More on this in a minute. When you check in for a concierge level suite, you are supposed to go to the 23rd floor and check in so you don't habve to wait in the very long lines in the main lobby. We called ahead with our travel itinerary and were told to go to the 23rd floor until 11pm. We arrived at 10:30 and had to cross a VERY smoky (yet allegedly \"smoke-free corridor\" across the entie casino floor to get to the guest suite elevators. We were also carying a rather heavy infant car-seat. We went to the 23rd floor which was locked up tight and we called from a house phone to be told to return to the front desk to check in. So we had to backtrack the entir smoky way with our 7-month old infant in a heavy car-seat and then wait in line at the main desk. When we checked in, the clerk asked if we wanted the xcheck left open so we could charge things to the room. We said yes. We ordered a turkey sandwich and botle of water from room service when we got to the room for a grand total of $41 dollars with tip. When we ordered, they said we weren't approved for room charges. So they transferred me to the front desk to clear it up. Then they transferred me back tot he room service people and they took the order. The waiter arrived and he said we had to pay cash since we were not approved. ?!?! What did we just go through then?! The next day we requested a tea-kettle \"hot-pot\" to boil water. It took them 4 hours and three phone calls to deliver it. We also had a minor spill on the bed duvet so we called housekeeping to have a replacement delivered. They took 6 hours and 4 phone calls to deliver it...even then it was because I caught a housekeeper in the hallway and she found us a new duvet. KEEP IN MIND, this is a \"concierge level\" suite that is supposed to have the BEST service the Palazzo can offer. We were not impressed..the service was no better, and in fact probably worse, than a typical hotel! All this being said, the rooms are spacious and nice, although as some people have commented, the A/C is quite loud. And for some unknown reason, ours apparently sucked air in from the kitchen vents since our room smelled like whatever meal they were cooking (eggs in the am, onions in the pm). There are a lot of really nice (and expensive) restaurants in the Palazzo. The Grand Lux is one of the more reasonable and keeping with their cheesecak factory roots, has a huge menu. We didn't see any of the Palazzo shows, but the Blue Man group is there and everyone raved about the show. We saw Cirque De Soliel \"Ka\" at the MGM and it was a spectacular show.

It also must have the most unique location - connected to the Venetian and Wynn and with the Mirage and TI across the street, you are very self contained. The casino was very crowded and the slots were no better or worse than other hotels, but as half the casino is smoke free, a much nicer environment than the others. Pools and spa were wonderful.

They offered to have maintenance look at the shower, or provide us with another room. We had no guarantee that another room's shower would drain any better (that was our major complaint), so we checked out after the first night. Maybe the bugs still have to be worked out.

I agree with what most of the other posters have said - we were very warmly welcomed , and the hotel is very tastefully done and understated (understated by Vegas standards, mind you, anywhere else it would be a little over the top!). We paid extra for staying in a concierge room (although we got a reasonably good deal) and really enjoyed all the little extras - limo service to and from the airport, got our coffee and breakfast there every day and brought it back to the room, etc, but especially the service we recieved from their concierge floor staff - no line ups and they booked shows, restaurants, and golf for us and gave us great advice. Although the rooms are billed as suites they are really one big room, with a step-down to a living area with a very comfortable sectional, dining table, desk and large tv. Still, I would like it better if this area was actually divided from the bedroom - For instance two people can't watch two different tv shows as the tvs are just a few meters from one another, or one person can't read or sleep while the other is watching tv without being disturbed. A little fridge space would have been nice as well. Still it was a nice spot for entertaining friends, as we did one afternoon. And yes, the Jersey Boys musak in the elevator does get to you after a while - although we started making jokes about it after the 2nd day.

Inside there are two casinos and abundant restaurants, bars, boutiques and the Grand Canal Shoppes. I was expecting a property this size (50 stories and over 3,000 rooms) to be completely impersonal, but the front desk, concierge and housekeeping staff were extremely pleasant and efficient. Room: I was travelling alone on business and booked a Luxury Suite for $119/night + tax for my Tuesday night stay. The suite was approximately 700 square feet with a king-sized bed, sunken living room with dining area, 3 flat-screen LCD TVs, a large marble bathroom with a soaking tub and separate glass shower and nice bath amenities. My room (#24911) overlooked the Wynn Hotel and Casino. I found the atmosphere of the room to be quiet and sumptuous, in stark contrast to the glitz and glitter of the Las Vegas Strip. Dining: There are about 40 restaurants to choose from in the combined Palazzo/Venetian but I only had the opportunity to dine in two of them. I had dinner at B&B Ristorante (one of Chef Mario Batali\u2019s many ventures). I sat at the bar and ordered the traditional tasting menu paired with a house Barbera. The meal was solidly good and the extensive wine list was quite impressive with several pages of Barolo and Barbaresco offered. The next morning I had breakfast at Bouchon (by Chef Thomas Keller of French Laundry and Per Se fame). I ordered the breakfast specials; a fresh crab meat omelet and strawberry croissant with coffee and orange juice. It was a very good and memorable breakfast.

We stayed for 4 nights and could not have been happier with the accomodations. Rooms: The rooms are outstanding. Comfortable beds, plenty of room for our clothes. spacious and well designed. Flat screen TV's at the foot of the bed and downstairs. It took us some time to really take all of the luxurious surrounding in. Two steps down from the bed is a living space. Another flat screen tv, mini bar (the gentleman at the reservation desk warned us that if you remove it you own it), snacks, safe. A business center...desk, phone, wireless, printer, fax machine, copy machine. A Table with 4 chairs and a L shaped couch that pulls out into another queen sized bed. The room was so inviting that we did something we have never done befroe in Vegas. Relaxed IN our room with drinks before heading out to the strip. Remote controlled drapes and roman shade. Floor to ceiling windows that were room width. USA Today newspaper at the door each morning, a simple thing but I love my paper at the pool in the morning. Bathroom: The bathroom was huge... Black marble sinks and counters. Seperate \"closet\" for the toilet. double sink with all the amentities, soap, shampoo, conditioner, loofa, hand soap, sewing kit. Flat screen TV above the sinks and angled towards the bath. Vanity with a pull out stool and make up mirror. Glass shower with large shower head, and two massage showers on the wall. Large bathtub. Mirrors everywhere. Robes and Slippers at the ready. The slippers are yours to keep, the robes are $85.00. Restaurants: Every morning we ate breakfast at the Grand Lux Cafe. AAAA+++ OUTSTANDING food and service. We had the express breakfast each morning. This is a mini buffet with made to order omlets, waffles, bagels and bread, scrambled eggs, sausage, bacon, ham and potatoes., cereal, oatmeal, assorted fresh pastries. coffe and juice included for $15.50. I asked for a coffe to go and my wife a juice to go each morning and we were never charged for the to go drinks. I know it is a simple thing, but this is the kind of service that makes you feel appreciated. Plus I love my coffee with my paper at the pool in the morning. This restaurant is a part of the Cheese Cake Factory chain and please do youself a favor and order a piece of cheese cake. WOW> We did not make time to eat elsewhere on the property, but I have heard great reviews for Delmonico Steak House. Pools: Large open pool decks. Has one large pool, and numerous smaller pools. 4 hot tubs spread throughout. The thing we really liked is that the pools were designed so that the loungers could be put right into the water. small side table also. drink service right in the water. How relaxing and wonderful. Staff came around frequently offering drinks, cold towels, cucumbers for your eyes, orange wedges. Once again pampered like never before. Drinks averaged around $12.00 for 16 oz. of your favorite mixed libations. The atmosphere was very relaxing and sophisticated, but not pretentious at all. 40 - 50 something crowd. The ONLY negative is that the sun does not hit the entire pool area until around 11:30am. But there is plenty of sunshine to be had the pool nearest to the walkway to the Venetian pool deck. We talked to a bunch of folks from the Venetian that were over on the Palazzo side, because they said our side was much nicer. You do have access to both properties. Spa: My wife used the Canyon Ranch Spa for a massage and pedicure. She was extremely pleased. Cudos to Shelly D. She was so pleased that she said she would come back here no matter where we stayed on the strip. Casino: Get your players club card. We received our four nights comped. We are not by any stretch of the imagination high rollers. I really like the layout of the casino floor. It is very spacious and has high ceilings, with the machines spread a good distance apart. Lots of room. Great drink service and the machines were kept clean. Friendly floor staff. Wish we could say we got rich, but we played a long time and that's all we ever ask for. We have stayed at numerous properties on the strip. Sorry Mandaly Bay, but we have a new #1 in our opinion. One suggestion I do have and it is my only negative for the property. The small sundries shop by the guest elevators is WAY over priced. $38.00 for a bottle of vodka, $9.00 for a small box of bandaids. I know you pay for convenience but come on.

Our luggage was lost (not the hotel's fault, the airline's - but it added to our frusteration).

We asked at the concierge desk in the lobby, and were told to go to the 23rd floor to the concierge check in desk for our room. We trudged through a massive lobby, the casino, and up the elevator to the 23rd floor to find the concierge closed. Apparently it does at 10:00pm, but the lobby concierge did not know this. We returned to the lobby to check in, and were not given even a slight appology. We went to our room , and then wanted to get something to eat. Again, we asked the lobby concierge, and she assured us that several restaurants were available between the Palazzo and the Venetian. We again walked through the casino to the back and to the walkway between the hotels. We checked at each of the restaurants, and they all had their last seating at 10:00pm. We ended up eating apps at a bar in the casino, which turned out to be the highlight of our day. We wouldn't have cared if that was all that was open, but did not appreciate being sent all over the place to find something - COMPLETE LACK OF SERVICE. As far as the casino goes, only ONCE was I asked if I wanted a drink. I played about 3 hours total, but that is outrageous. The next day, our room was NEVER CLEANED!!! We went out for the day, and returned at 5:00pm. The room was still uncleaned.

Our room was beautiful, even a TV in the bathroom with subtitles for when showering! Bathrrom also has a separate adjoining toilet. As well as standard clzaning service someone would come in of an evening and leave chocolates on the pillow and turn the radio on for when you arrived back. Nice touch. The concierge deskwas always helpful when we were making restaurant reservations and enquiring about excursions, all the staff very polite and friendly. Our room was suite 716 on the 25th floor and overlooked the strip and the Treasure Island hotel. A fantastic view. The casino, as expected, was always buzzing and the Palazzo shops lead through to the Grand Canal Shoppes in the Venetian. We had a couple of hot days so I made brief use of the pool/s (there are 9 of them). I would recommend this hotel to anyone.

Our room on the 48Th floor had a nice view of the Wynn and the golf course. Food: Very disappointed at most places at both hotels - why does it seem every hotel restaurant has to have \"Wolfgang Puck\" name associated with it ? He must be the McDonald's of gourmet cuisine. We ate at Dos Caminos, Tao & The Riva. Basically when the place's is so dark you can't see the plate and music's blasting loud don't expect much from the food. In fact not one server on the whole trip even came by to ask if we were actually enjoying the meal. The highlight for me was the Noodle Asia (Venetian) where the Dim Sum's great and affordable. Shows: Saw Blue Man Group at the Venetian and the Jay Leno at the Mirage - both tickets were bought at the Tickets 4 Tonight. Got a question - how do you really know your saving money from this place ? They don't assign you a seat until you head to the box office and you might get a cheaper seat. Clubs: Went to Tao, Lavo, with only the Sat night being really busy. All the clubs had paid girls in the casino's trying to get single girls in to the club's - not a good sign ... Vegas is feeling the effects of the economy but I still love that place. Closing: Get ready to nickeled and dimed but that's expected at a star ... paid $16 for small pot of tea to the room ($8 + $4 delivery + tax & tip). Go elsewhere to eat. Guess the economy is having a affect - on Wed night took half hour to get a drink and I could tell it was not what I ordred ( double JW black with soda)", "Date": "October 13, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "California", "Title": "\u201cLoved the Palazzo Hotel & Casino Las Vegas\u201d", "Author": "GinnyAlamo", "ReviewID": "UR20831263", "Content": "The Palazzo hotel is terrific!

Would have liked to have seen them put a bench into the shower, but it's still very nice. The Palazzo is very simple but elegent, the casino is relatively small, and just one big room, but I like it that way. I hate getting lost at every corner of a casino. It really doesn't have a theme which I like, unless you count \"lots of marble\" as a theme. Ate at the Grand Lux several times, and it was always good. A tip I'd give though is that the hightops in the bar area are first come first served, but the wait was not really that long anyway. Loved the pool areas, although the main pool doesn't get sun until after noon. I love the shallow part of the pools that have the loung chairs in them....very refreshing. The economic times are definitely being felt in LV...no real crowds, and all of the locals I talked to were saying it's been really bad.....maybe they'll stop charging rediculous amounts for drinks and food.

Staff at the check-in desk were friendly and efficient, and I even got coupons with play credit, discount on food, and that sort of stuff, which I though was pretty cool given that I hadn't booked through the hotel itself. Then the rooms, oh pardon my French: suites! They are h-u-g-e, beds are comfortable and the view was stunning (I looked on the swim deck, but could see a bit of the strip as well). All the furniture is brand-spanking-new, so it just adds to the feeling of sumptuous luxury. Bathroom is very spacious, with a separate toilet. Nice touches are the remote controlled curtains and fancy bathroom amenities. One more thing: I really liked the hallways - they curve a little, and are slightly dark - but lovely carpeting. It makes you feel you're heading into an exclusive night club instead of back to your room. I preferred the Palazzo's casino to that of the Venetian - those scarcely clad ladies there give it a cheap feel. But the table staff at the Palazzo were very nice and welcoming - perhaps caused by the fact that the hotel and casino had just opened, so wasn't as busy as in other big casinos. Food is great as well, you're literally spoiled for choice. The pool deck looked awesome, but I didn't venture in. One slight mishap: I had some amazon stuff delivered to the hotel, and they added 'package delivery charges' to my room, without informing me beforehand. They corrected it when I mentioned it, so it was ok. I went to see the Phantom spectacular at the Venetian, and... well... I know and love the original play, and this version left me breathless, but not in a good way. It really makes you feel as if they want to rush you out into the casino as soon as possible, so they're jogging you through the play.

My girl friend and I drove to Vegas in the middle of the night (Swingers Style), which isn\u2019t too far for us, considering we live in LA. I hadn\u2019t slept in about 30 hours and was exhausted by the time we got into Vegas at 630am. We called the Palazzo to see if we could check in early so that I could get some ZzZz before a long night of drunken, gambling debauchery. Unfortunately, the Palazzo wasn\u2019t able to accommodate our early arrival so we opted to go into Downtown Las Vegas and get a room at Fitzgerald\u2019s(see review), an older Hotel, until we were able to check into the Palazzo at 3pm. Upon Check in at the Palazzo, I was taken over by the beautiful check in area. Absolutely magnificent! We were fortunate enough to be invited guests and able to check in at a special low wait time desk, Awesome! The scenery was pleasant and clean and the fact that the Palazzo is connected to the Venetian with all of its fantastic shopping was great for me, bad for my American Express. Our room was gorgeous with an awesome picturesque window overlooking a golf course with a Mountainous backdrop. Overall the stay was nice. The room was beautiful, very quiet, as we were at the end of a long hallway and everything had a very new feel to it. There were a few small things that could be better. Considering the Hotel and Casino were built in something like 8 months or so, I am sure some things were overlooked: 1. When we got to our room for the first time, my girl friend and I were standing outside of our door for several minutes because the door would not open. The little lock showed that the key worked, however the door was not budging. Lucky for us \"Letty,\" a very friendly person on the housekeeping staff, came over and kicked (and I am dead serious when I say KICKED), the door open for us. That seemed to be an issue for me coming back to the room at 4am, drunk, forgetting that the door was sticky and on top of that waking up my friend with the sounds of my Chuck Norris style roundhouse kick to the door and on one instances my chubby body hurling across the threshold onto the floor. 2. There are no 24 hour restaurants in the Palazzo. We did, however, find great pleasure at the Grand Luxe Cafe in the Venetian at 3am, munching on their FANTASTIC Spinach dip and Arnold Palmers. Yum! 3. On FOUR different occasions while gambling we saw Palazzo Security hassling young ladies that were obviously suspected as hookers. In one instance, there were about 6 security guards surrounding a young lady, hassling her about being in the Casino. This went on for about 20 minutes until she was escorted out of sight. That particular instance put a damper on my \"Cops and Donuts\" Penny Slot experience. I think it would have been much more advantageous, had they ushered the young ladies to a spot out of patron's view. I have to say that I felt sick to my stomach and had to leave the Casino for a bit after the animalistic way they treated her. I mean, Vegas wouldn\u2019t be Vegas without some hookers here and there. I am kidding. But, there is a good way and a bad way at handling certain things, and this was definitely the wrong way. 4. They forgot our wake-up calls on two separate occasions! I am SO glad that I didn\u2019t have plans on those days! 5. When in Vegas, I chain smoke. Bad, Bad. The Casino is nice in that it isn\u2019t overly Smokey like Vintage Vegas used to be. There are a few areas that are clearly marked as \u201cNon-Smoking Areas,\u201d However, I found that a lot of the cool games were in that area. Boo! 6. On check-out day, there was an hour long wait for a Bellman to come help with luggage. We decided to lug all our stuff downstairs ourselves and considering I somehow ended up with more stuff than I started with (imagine that!) it was a big hassle. We were lucky enough to have bribed a Bellman on the way down to take our luggage and check it so we could grab lunch before leaving.

The guest services manager arranged for the \"House Car\" to bring me back to the airport at no extra expense.

Firstly, we arrive in the taxi and helped out of the car and into the hotel lobby...which by the way, is lovely! There was a large queue for check-in but i only had to wait 10 minutes. I was booked into my room and giving a suite with a nice view of the strip upon request. (at no charge). The elevators were a short walk from the lobby and there are plenty of them so it doesn't get too crowded. We were up to the 42nd floor in a matter of seconds. Onto the room...the decor is nice, and the raised sleeping area is a nice touch. The L shaped sofa in the lounge area was extremely comformtable, and with remote controlled blinds and curtains it made relaxing with a cocktail from the 24 hour room service by the huge window very enjoyable. The kingsize bed was extremely comfortable as were the numerous pillows. My only problem was the lack of a fridge, but the mini bar was used to store 2 small bottles of water at the top so this didn't bother me. The bathroom was very spacious, with a seperate toilet area. The bath itself was lovely, deep and very enjoyable. The shower was very refreshing, and there was plenty space...even for 2. With 2 sinks, and a seperate make-up mirror, desk and seat it made for plenty room to get ready without getting in each others way. The bathrobes and slippers were comfortable too. Room service was great. I locked my wallet and key in my case and it was sorted within 10 minutes. The maids cleaned the room twice a day if required. (note: it's worth leaving a big tip on the first day to ensure top service...it is vegas afterall). The mini bar is kept topped up all the time. Location wise, it is perfect. Short walking distance from the centre of the strip, without being next to all the tacky parts. IE you are next to the more flash hotels, but in 10-15minutes you can walk as far up as the bellagio. In my opinion the length of strip where the Wynn, Palazzo and Ventian are is the nicest stretch of the strip by far. The hotel has 30 restaurents withing 10 minutes walk and everyone we tried was really nice. The bars were pricey for cocktails, but try a Aquatini in the Aquaknox bar downstairs...i ordered 3 bottles of the main ingredient as soon as i got home!! My biggest problem with this hotel, is that i'm fidning it too hard to pick a hotel for my other holidays because for the \u00a3110 a night price i got the Palazzo at, nothing else can come close. Price will go up to Bellagio prices for 2009 but in my opinion, that would stil be worth every penny. Excellent rooms, excellent location, excellent service. Me and my girlfriend had the best 2 weeks of our lives, and 10 nights of that was in the Palazzo...the best 10 nights of the holiday. We also stayed in the Panorama Suite at Planet Hollywood.

We had stayed at The Wynn last year and were overwhelmed by the incredible beauty of that hotel, the service,amenities,etc and were hoping for another great experience at this new hotel. We had heard some mixed reviews, but were willing to give the hotel a chance. When we arrived at the airport, the limosine driver was not there to meet us as expected. (This amenity was included in our package). In fact when we called to confirm the limosine pickup while still at the airport in NY, the concierge apologized for not having initiated the confimation earlier in the week, prior to our pending arrival. When we finally found the limo driver, he was very cordial and friendly, but the limo itself reeked heavily of cigar smoke and that unfortunately made for an unpleasant ride. When we arrived at the lobby to check-in, we were told that we needed to go up to the 23rd floor for check-in on the Concierge level. It was around 9:45 by this time and we were both a little tired from our flight and just wanted to settle in. When we got up to the concierge level, there was no one there to greet us. The halls were empty. Not exactly a welcoming feeling. There were double doors adjacent to the elevators with a sign in front of them which stated that the concierge reception area was closed for the evening and that they would reopen at 6am the following morning. We called down to the front desk, who suggested that we come back down again to the check-in area downstairs. By this time, we were feeling inconvienced and not in the mood to lug our luggage downstairs again . We were paying for the top suite in the hotel and we were definitely not feeling that \"luxurious\" feeling that had been promised when they booked our suite. It turned out that the concierge check-in area had decided to arbitrarily close their doors early because they were attending to a room transfer of some sort. When they did open the doors for us , the representative at the concierge, gave us a curt and rather insincere apology for the issue with the limo as well as the decision to close the concierge doors early. Wouldn't the concierge have been aware that the limo was picking us up at the airport and be expecting us? Couldn't the front desk downstairs have been able to coordinate more effectively with the concierge or management to make sure we were being taken care of? These glitches in service were disconcerting and really unprofessional. When we finally arrived at the suite, the first thing I did was open the closet doors to start unpacking. In the closet, I found some shopping bags left there by the previous occupants of the room. When I looked inside the bags I found their receipts--with their names,etc This made another really bad impression. And although the suite itself was lovely, there were burnt matches left on the carpet, the bathroom door in one of the bathrooms didn't close, the scale in the other bathroom was broken, etc,etc. We had heard that the palazzo had been built in 8 months and that a lot of details had been rushed, but for a top suite at a supposedly decent hotel, this lack of attention to detail in every regard was disappointing. After the first night's stay there, we were able to leave and go back to The Wynn. There are so many great hotels in Vegas . The Wynn is unbelievable and so is The Bellagio and there are many others to choose from. I would not take a chance with the palazzo until they can train their general staff better and start paying attention to detail.", "Date": "September 9, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Mankato", "Title": "\u201cOpulent!!\u201d", "Author": "manktripguy", "ReviewID": "UR19901924", "Content": "Had stayed at the Venetian in the past and loved it, so I decided to try out the Palazzo.

However, plush bathrobes and a lavish pool area don't make a really outstanding hotel. In my view, a great hotel is made by its ability to convey a true sense of hospitality and constantly surprise guests with excellence. The Palazzo just does not get anywhere close to that - in the end it is just another well-oiled Las Vegas hotel factory which is pretty blunt about its main goal: make you spend money beyond what you already paid for your room. One example of this lack of true excellence was an in-room dinning experience I had at the Palazzo during my stay last weekend. I ordered food late afternoon on Friday and was told it would be in my room \"under an hour\"; after 60 minutes I called back and was told my order is \"the next to leave the kitchen\"; when the food showed up 20 minutes later the server told me that they would take 15% off the bill for being late. Three problems with that: (1) a one hour wait for a sandwich, some fries and a coke is quite long to start with (2) the offer to take off 15% (which - by the way - is less than the 18% mandatory tip on the bill...) is slightly insulting - as if 30 minutes of my time are only worth a couple of dollars (3) when the food finally arrived it was very cold and \"just ok\" quality You would think that if a place like this does not deliver the expected service (time or quality), they should take off the charge, no questions asked - there is no \"15% wrong\" in the league the Palazzo aims to play. Again, a nice hotel, but once you have read all the reviews here you pretty much know exactly what to anticipate and should keep your expectations low as there is little chance the Palazzo will over-deliver.", "Date": "September 4, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "2", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "3", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "ventura", "Title": "\u201cBetter bring photo ID or face security!\u201d", "Author": "lawqueen", "ReviewID": "UR19726991", "Content": "I was also there for 5 days at a convention over Labor Day weekend. We bought the \"pass\" for $29.99/day which allows access to the spa without the daily fee and allows a $20 credit at certain restaurants. It took about 10 minutes at check in for them to figure this out and print coupons. Went to the pool, there was absolutely NO service. I went to the bar at the pool and ordered drinks which the very nice bartender carried back to my chaise. He was mobbed on the way by people waving their arms for service. There is no children's pool, big mistake. Yes, chaises in the pool are great, but no one picks up the wet towels, plastic cups, cherries etc. floating in the pool from these. I signed the check to my room at the pool. We went then to Sushi Samba in the hotel for dinner. It was ok, the kobe beef was good, but when I wanted to sign the check to the room, the waiter told me I needed picture ID. I showed him my room key which is just about all I had, coming from the pool. He called the manager over. Very condecending. Told him I was trying to pay my bill but he also insisted on photo ID and blocked my way out of the restaurant after I just put my room number and signature on the check they provided. He then called security, a slew of them, who advised me that it is Nevada law that each person in Nevada carry photo ID at all times. . .so be aware. I ultimately put the charge on my American Express, the SAME American Express given to the front desk at check in. Well, they took it and get this. . .without any ID at all! Bouchon and Morels did not require any ID to sign the check to your room. Two outlets in the bathroom did not work with my hair iron. The hair dryer did not blow any hot air. People in adjacent rooms were smoking so much pot that the entire floor reeked. (I know some may love this). Over 1 hour to get a pot of coffee from room service in the morning. Turn down service was sporadic. There IS express check out but I did not use it since I wanted to review the bill since Sushi Samba did NOT credit my bill with the $20 credit but, alas, I had forgotten that it was on my American Express bill that I will receive shortly and see if it was credited after my complaint to the Palazzo house manager about the scene paying and the lack of common sense.

The only complaints I have about Palazzo could be due entirely to the long weekend crowds. The elevators at check-out time are completely ridiculous. It took us about 25 minutes and some ingenuity to get into an elevator and downstairs to check-out. That leads me to my other gripe, which is that there is no express check-out available. So, just allow for extra time when trying to leave your floor and the hotel itself. The check-out line could have easily been cut in half if express check-out was available.

I had booked the hotel through a Palazzo/Venetian promotional email/newsletter about 6 months prior to my arrival. At least once a night I would check the reviews on this website to see pictures and what others have been saying. I was a lil hesitant from some of the negative views but now having to experience it myself, I dont know what the negative reviews are about. Ignore it! Let me lay out my stay for you from beginning till end: Arrival: I was greeted by a bellman who checked my luggage and valet my car. Of course, you have to tip. Check-in: Waited less than 15 minutes for an attendant to check me in. I wish I remembered the gentleman who helped me since he was so nice and did a good job assigning us a room with a view. I did the \"sandwich\" trick (slip $20 in between Credit Card and Drivers License) to see if I would get a free upgrade. He smiled and said thank you. I had originally booked a Luxury VIew suite (1 king with guaranteed view) and after a nice conversation with him, he gave me a 42nd floor Bella Strip View suite that included 2 queen beds, an amazing view of the side of the Venetian, Venetian pools, and the strip itself that included the Mirage, Ceasars, City Center and Bellagio. All in all the \"sandwich\" trick worked as I hoped it would since I had 3 other people with me and a 1 king bed room would not be ideal for all 4 of us. Room: The room was amazing. Security is always stationed at the elevators to check room keys. Like I mentioned we had the Bella View suite on the 42nd floor. We had turn down service every night that included fresh new towels, a made up bed and chocolates. YES chocolates. 3 LG flat screen screen tv's. 1 in the sunken living room which was maybe a 27inch screen. 1 in the bed area which was a 32inch screen and a smaller one in the bathroom. Every morning, we got free LA times which I thought was weird because its Nevada. I guess they know which guests stay in California. Again, the room is a WOW. Worth the money as it is the biggest \"basic\" suite on the strip. Pool: Another WOW factor. You can access both the Palazzo and Venetian pool. I was mostly at the Palazzo pool as it was less crowded. Good crowd mixed with families, adults and younger folks like myself. Since it is summer, the pools are open until 8pm. Went to the pool once towards the vening around 5pm and twice the 2nd day. Perfect time to cool off at night and dip your feet in the water pr get a quick swim from the 100+ weather. Second day, One time in the morning which is great for those who are looking to swim in the shade and sun. Sun doesnt hit ALL of the pool areas until mid day (by 11am). My favorite part of the pool was the lounge chairs that are sunken in the pool itself. Great for staying cool while baking in the sun. Most sun hitting areas are taken by 11 12pm so come out early especially for the sunken lounge chairs in the water. Theirs also a bar at the center of the main pool. Rarely saw attendants taking drink orders. One never came to me as I wanted to order a drink but it wasnt a priority. Casino/Mall: Again another Wow. Though im not a big gambler, noticed the casino floor was just the right size. It didnt feel like vegas which is a good thing as everything was very open. Some casinos on the strip including the fairly ewer ones (Ceasars, Bellation for example) are overcrowded with slots and game tables. Palazzo everything is stretched out. Not too much of everything. Restaurants: Ate at Grand Lux like everybody else. Big portions. A must! From the makers of Cheesecake. Check-out: Easy as 1 2 3. Check out using the tv. Cons: Some minor cons that I experienced in the hotel. Mostly in the room. Light in the foyer/hall of the room was not working. Missing light fixture cover and I believe a frame in the bathroom. A picture frame by the dining room was missing as well. Paint wall and dry wall was coming off and dented by the ac vent which is not noticeable but if you pay attention to detail, you will see it. Pictures frames hung in the bedroom area were scratched. Vanity table was dusty as well. Lastly, big water stain that was not coming off was seen on the marble seperating the bedroom and sunken living room. Cons did not bother me at all but I was just asking myself, didnt this hotel just open in January and the rooms are already semi torn up?", "Date": "August 25, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "london", "Title": "\u201cThe Best hotel by far\u201d", "Author": "Gem030", "ReviewID": "UR19294222", "Content": "The Palazzo was amazing, i have no idea how anyone could not give this hotel a bad review!

Plenty of clean towels, very large bathroom always spotless. The beds were so comfortable i slept like a baby. I would gladly live in this suite! The casino was spacious with high ceilings so that they never smelt or seemed smokey. By far the cleaniest and i think best casino in any of the hotels on the strip (we visited them all). The palazzo shops are fantastic especially if you are looking for a variety, never too busy and there are some great restaurants hidden away. I much preffered the shops here to the Venetian. The plus with this hotel is that you can use all the facilities at the Venetian and everything is within short walking distance. I believe the Palazzo has all the charm of the venetian but it is more classy and quieter, full of charm. The staff could not have been friendlier and helped out very quickly with any requests. The palazzo pool area is spacious and split into a few different pool areas. The main pool does not get the sun until at least midday so we used one of the other pools and always got a space - the sun longers in the pool are a must they made sun bathing alot easier even with a hangover in the 100+ heat! At the weekend the Venetian pool got sooo busy we much preferred the more relaxed palazzo pools, but that just depends what you are looking for. The restaurants were excellent, Woo was great i would highly recommend it to anyone who likes asian food. Grand Luxe Cafe was friendly and served good food with huge portions - cheesecake to die for. Entoca san marco was great for their cured meats and wine selection. Bouchon had excellent steaks and a great oyster bar it was just ashame that our waiter was rude and only interested in the larger tables - bigger tips! but still def worth a visit the decor is very authentic.

In general I was impressed by the hotel and my room, but there were some issues that need to be resolved. The first problem was at checkout. I was checked in speedily enough and headed up to my room. However, I arrived at my room to find someone else trying to enter it too. It seemed like they had assigned both of us to the same room. However, my key card did not work and his did, so I began to suspect they had just told me the wrong room number. I called down the front desk, and it turns out I was in the room next door and they had just written down the wrong room number. It was a simple mistake, but it was annoying when I had just come from a 15 hour flight from England. The room itself was gorgeous, with beautiful, comfortable beds and expensive fittings. The bathroom was gorgeous, but it was let down by really low quality towels, the sort of threadbare white towels you would see in a cheap motel. I expected plush, nice towels, but these were worse than I would ever buy myself. Internet was reasonably priced, at 10 dollars for 24 hours in your room, and free wireless in the ground floor. Note that the internet at the conference facilities is horrendously overpriced, at about 10 dollars for an hour instead. Having purchased the internet in my room, I was disappointed I could not use the same access code during the conference. There were three TVs in my room, one of which had a DVD player, and two of which were HD. Note that the number of channels is limited to basic cable though, as they don't provide channels such as HBO or Showtime. The view from my room was great too, overlooking half of Vegas from the 39th floor. I ate at some of the hotel's restaurants. I liked the Grand Lux Cafe for breakfast, but disliked Dos Caminos, the strange Mexican restaurant that tried too hard to be fancy. Morel's steakhouse was amazing but expensive, but Carnevino steakhouse was a real letdown, as we got taken there by a company and the set menu did not have any steak (strange for a steakhouse). The only beef on the menu was raw. The pool area at the Palazzo was great, and I really enjoyed it during the hot Vegas summer.

We ended up checking our luggage/bags until our room was available, as we had an early flight into Vegas (9am.) The room was ready at about 12pm. Check-in couldn't have been more simple and quick. Upon opening the door to our suite, we were so impressed by the room. The bathroom was very spacious, and the sunken living room was a VERY nice feature! We had requested a complimentary upgrade so we would have a nice view of the strip, and we were given one! Our suite was on the 37th floor with a great view of Treasure Island, The Mirage, and more as you looked further down the strip. The TV's (we had 3) were all very nice Samsung HDTV's, and they had very clear pictures at all times. We had an AMFM/CD/MP3 hookup that I was able to hook my iPod into and listen to music as we were getting ready in the evenings. The beds were very comfortable and plush, high thread count sheets forsure. The maids were very great about cleaning our room and seeing that we had plenty of fresh towels, etc. Also, an added bonus, we had remote controlled black-out drapes...which were nice to have. After being so impressed by our room, I knew it could only get better after venturing around the hotel. There were several pools, some of which had lounge chairs partially in the water. It was over 100 degrees each day we were there, so that was a wonderful feature to have! They also had cabana boys bringing around frozen towels, etc. to visitors. The bar seemed to have a nice selection of cocktails, but they come at a price. We had dinner at Dos Caminos one night, which was arguably one of the best meals I've had. The staff at the restaurant were very attentive to our every need, while remaining very polite. The casino inside of the Palazzo was also very nice...and didn't seem to be nearly as smokey as the others. At night it seemed to be a little worse, but through the day I can't say I even noticed a smokey-smell. They had a very nice coffee shop called \"The Coffee Bean & Tea Leaf\" which was nice to grab a bite to eat for breakfast, or to have a nice cup of coffee in the evening. One of my favorite things about the hotel was the scent as you entered into the lobby (main entrance) I asked the bellman on the way out what they were infusing into the air and he told me it was a jasmine/lavender combination.

I really like the layout of this hotel. It's easy to get from place to place without walking for miles and the decor is beautiful without being too over the top. The guest elevators are across the smallish casino from check in, and the pool area is just an elevator ride away from the rooms. Our room/suite was gorgeous. Loved the L-shaped couch. Kids got a charge out of the electronic shades and curtains. The bathroom was so well laid out and we appreciated the sit-down vanity. Also enjoyed the three-head shower and small flat screen tv in the bathroom. The concierge floor is huge and takes up the entire 23rd floor. The lounge is broken up into several rooms and/or conversation areas so it has some privacy. Complimentary newspapers (inluding Wall Street Journal, the Las Vegas local and USA Today) are available for guests. I don't think we ate $100 worth of food a day but it was so convenient having coffee, etc. available in a calm, quiet atmosphere every morning and snacks/drinks at night. The ham and cheese croissants served both mornings were delicious. I will say that the quality of food on the concierge level is better at Paris but this was still very nice. I liked having the option of self-serve water bottles at Paris--here you had to ask the bartender if you wanted a bottle. Several times he/she was busy preparing drinks and I didn't want to stand in line just to get a bottle of water so left without. Pretty small complaint though.

The interiors are beautiful to walk through and the retail is high-end (Barneys and up). While connected to the Venetian, the Palazzo doesn\u2019t have the schmaltzy Venetian feel. The Canyon Ranch Spa has also expanded and the Palazzo side is so inviting. I highly recommend the Canyon Ranch Grill for dinner. The salmon with an apple slaw was outstanding and the service was exemplary! They also make these amazing organic drinks with homemade syrups, like ginger ale and cola. You need to try one!

First to start the trip off wrong we had 10 rooms booked for a convention. We all did not check in together, but half of us had problems. My friend had booked 2 queens and they kept insisting she paid for a king and would not give her the 2 queen beds. She is a ceo of a company and all reservations were made by her manager. All messed up by the hotel. It gave us a real bad first taste and took a couple of days to wear off!! We were suppose to have adjoining rooms even called ahead 2 times. Nope, impossible for them to do! (by the way when another of our party checked later in they had a king bed booked but they offered them the 2 queens for the same price and let them know that was like a privelage!! ) LOL must have ran out of kings. As I stood at front desk listening to other people checking in it became very obvious that these front desk people must have a quatta to meet or get bonuses for upgrading people becuase it was a push push push atmosphere. \"Would you like a view room we can upgrade usually 100 a night but today we can do it for 40\" and crap like that, over and over and over again. It was gross listening to it. 5 star, nope you just went down big time for that one!! Service: some good some poor. I found front desk staff (some of them ) to be blah not real friendly and just seeming to work on commission or something. Coctail service was far and few between, and I am not a drinker just water or coffee, far and few at the machine areas anyway(i did not play the tables The grand luax was wonderful like many say and good thing since everything else is high priced or too trendy for my taste. I missed having a buffet in my otel too, as tacky as that sounds sometimes its just nice to go somewhere not have to think and have somethign for everyone. But once again grand luax was awesome and I ate there at least once a day for lunch or dinner, huge menu good portions, nice people working all parts, good food, just very nice and open 24/7 which should happen more in vegas since it is vegas! The room was nice I can't complain. it is big, nice tvs etc like most reviews have said. I also like they had a decent amount of tv stations unlike some other casino hotels. Beds were very nice, I would like one at home like it! The view depends on room mine was ok. But with all the tall buildings now etc dont ever expecct to get views the way we did before vegas got so built up! The room was clean not the cleanest I have ever stayed at but good. The phones in room are confusing and we all commented on how if older people are staying there etc. they would go nuts trying to figure them out or read the writing on the etc. Water pressure in my room was great, in my other friends the shower pressure was so poor she actually showered in my room one day. The a/c and everythign else worked very nice. If you are suppose to have turn down service ever night then do it. After reading other reviews I could not wait to see if I got it. Ok I got it 2 out of 5 nights so that rating gets a zero to me. Evidently they are having problems with this. Heres and Idea management. How about when they clean the room whenever they do leave the pice of chocolate on the bed and fill the ice bucket then. Hmmmmmmmmmm couls save some money and everyone would get it toooooo. BRAIN STORM Its not really a big deal anyway, its a tiny piece of choclate etc please just do it when cleaning then you won't have people complaining about not getting it. Casino was nice, I like it better than venitian casino which was packed everytime i went into it It did lack some of the newer games that other casinos had. i did'nt do any better or worse than any other casinos, gambling wise. The pools are gorgeous I thought, probally one of the best in vegas They wre not crowded when I was there except for the venitian pool which you can walk to from pallazzo. i loved the walk they are like seven pools, I could have had my own pool if i wanted to the mornings I went down. Very very nice and you can find shaded ares in the morning too. I liked this very very much. But once again if you are walking around with orange slices or cucumber slices then do it, just don't do it randomly or people feel they did'nt get the srvice that others did. So do it right or don't do it. The parking in the underground garage was great, elevator brings you right into the lobby, thanks whoever wrote that before in another review, it helped me out, easy parking right off sands ave. perfect that i didnt even use valet anymore. Valet was good when used. I don't know if I would stay again. I did like the large rooms but Its kind of big with lots of selections but not really my type. Thank God for the Grand laux for eating. I think it is far from harrahs ballys flamingo etc if you want to walk in 100 plus degrees and fight crowds. So maybe its more of a hotel to kinda of just stay at. For me i like to bop around more. I did go to wynn and thought the areas were lovely I would maybe try it there but not sure. The casino did have a much much much better selection of games than the venitian or pallazo. I did notice though that some of the workers were not always that nice either in my 6 hour stay there. I did get comped a buffet for 2 and 4 or us went. I thought it was good, clean, but it had things more daring than me, like lamb cooked 2 different ways and venicine (ugg). they had regular stuff to so don't worry. i did like the casino it was big but didnt seem as loud as venitians. Now in this review please keep in mind I like the older vegas where they treated you better, things were smaller, and it was easier to get great service since the hotels didnt have 5000 plus rooms, etc So after a long review heres the bottom line service needs training like they do at harrahs properties, yes, thank you, a smile, have a great trip, good luck, etc words go a long way maybe grand laux restaurant could train the pallazzo staff rooms very nice, large and i really nver heard any noise from neighbors which is awesome pools many to pick from , looked clean and very very nice 2 main shows on property phantom and blue man both good Blue man a little weird phantom very nice) le reve at wynn was my favorite though very very good If you are going to be eating upscale on the property plan on getting comped a lot or paying a lot. i like it further down the strip more so even if you stay at the ventitian it is closer to harrahs flamingo etc than the pallazzo is. the pallazzo is on the corner of sand ave, look it up on a map it is a 5 minute walk to the wynn treasure island is across the street which i never made it too (darn it) After the check in nightmare and bad first day, maybe after the 3rd day it started growing on me, tne it was time t go home. I guess I need 7 days rather than 5 2 to get adjusted :) Where ever you stay have fun enjoy If you are looking for off strip I would pick rio, orleans, and even gold cost the last 2 are simple but clean and fun and just easy going and you can get to the strip pretty quick but can get away from the hustle and bustle I am sad to say it is just tooooo big and busy ont he strip now and I liked it like 10 years ago that was the biggest it should have got.

I read every review posted on this site before booking and was extremely happy with the chance we took.

From check in to check out service was unparalleled. As soon as we arrived bags were taken from the cab and delivered to the room within 15 minutes of check in. Check out can be done from the room TV which makes things easy. Bag storage is availble after check out which is fantastic for those with afternoon flights. By staying at Palazzo we had use of both Palazzo and Venetian Pools which was nice. Drink service at the pools was great. The Palazzo and Venetian have enough restaurants and amentaties that you really never have to leave the property. Drink waitresses in the casino were very attentive (both at the high limit tables as well as regular tables) and very nicely dressed as well. Overall the experience was second to none. By far my best stay in Vegas to date. We ate at Delmonico Steakhouse (Venetian) which was great, Tao Asian Bistro (Venetian) which was good (great atmosphere, food was good not great), Table 10 (Palazzo) which was good not great (great service), Sushisamba (Palazzo) which was the best Sushi I have ever had which is saying a lot. I have been to Nobu and other world famous sushi restaurants and Sushisamba was better. I also recommend the Palazzo due to location. There is a walking bridge connection the Palazzo to the Wynn.

I booked at the Venetian and the Palazzo. And to qualify my review, although I love higher end properties like the Four Seasons, I find the newly remodeled Intercontinental properties, and rooms at the Grand Hyatt, most Hiltons, and W hotels are usually clean and comfortable enough for me. I was disappointed as soon as I walked into my room at the Palazzo. 2 weeks before I had stayed at the Venezia Tower Suites and when I walked into my room at the Venezia, it was elegant, immaculate, and the attention to detail all the way from the lobby of the Venetian, through the corridors, the Venezia lobby, the elevators---everything was beyond my expectations. I felt as if I walked into a Park Avenue apartment worthy of a page in Architectural Digest. There was a mirror and marble ledge in the entry way, mirrored counter on the vanity, mirrored bathroom door, padded walls behind the beds that were covered in what I think was silk, elegant window treatments, molding that created square panels on all the walls, furniture that I wouldn\u2019t doubt was antique\u2014leather topped writing desk, dining chairs were in the same style that a friend paid thousands of dollars for, and tasteful artwork meticulously arranged over the couch in the living area. It was sumptuous but tastefully done. Great lighting\u2014there must have been a dozen light switches in the room! Not a stranger to Vegas hotels over the years, I was used to fixtures and d\u00e9cor that was made to look expensive but usually missed the mark and was either tacky or overdone. In the Venezia, I would lay in bed and marvel at all the details of the room which is why this review is so descriptive. At the Palazzo, the layout of the room is similar but the furnishings and detail do not compare to the Venezia Suites. Even my father who is the one that always gets the comp rooms, and does not usually care about such things even said, the other place was elegant, this place is....let's just say he didn' t like it. First of all, the furnishings at the Palazzo are velvet--in the hot desert??? Even though the property is only a few months old, the velvet was dirty looking, and stained. Even a guy friend said he didn't want to sit on the velvet couch in his room unless he put a towel down. Yeah, gross. The colors, the browns, made the room look dark and the carpet looked dingy. The furnishings and fixtures did not look as nice as at the Venezia. At the Palazzo, the lamps, artwork, and all the furniture with the exception of the bed, were all cheap looking. I am sad because I heard they are remodeling the Venetian in the same weird art deco/70\u2019s style which I think is a terrible mistake. To top off my disappointment in the appearance of the room, housekeeping hadn't even finished cleaning the bathroom when I first walked into my room at 3:30pm. Towels had not all been replaced, the tub had dirt in it, the toilet seat was still up with cleaner in the bowl, and garbage left on the floor. This made me wonder about the cleanliness of the rest of the room. I did not have this concern at the Venezia. The housekeeping staff there was incredibly pleasant and helpful. The Palazzo staff seemed tired and overworked and not as pleasant. Now for the plusses. The Palazzo casino is easier to get to. And they have remote controlled shades which are pretty cool but I could live without it if the room looked cleaner. I loved the casino staff at the craps table at the Palazzo\u2014may have helped that I was winning and throwing down money for the dealers. [Cocktail staff was hard to come by.] The pool at the Venezia tower was smaller but quieter, not as crowded, pretty garden area, with large spa pool and 2 jacuzzis. Beautiful at night. [Didn't go to the Palazzo pool, but could see it from my room. It was huge, & crowded, which didn't appeal to me.] To sum up: I was going to check into the Palazzo again in 2 weeks but after my experience I switched it to the Venetian and hope that I will have a better experience and maybe even be lucky enough to get placed in the Venezia Tower Suites again. Otherwise, I am fine with staying at Paris Hotel, Bally\u2019s, and Ceasar\u2019s. Yes, the size of the rooms are great at the Palazzo but if you feel like you are walking onto a cheesy porno set and don\u2019t want to sit on the furniture, what\u2019s the point?

I go to Vegas about 8 times per year and have stayed all over, including the Wynn and Mandalay Bay. The only notable resorts I haven't been to are Bellagio and the new Trump. Palazzo is immaculately clean and the water features, fountains and sculptures are gorgeous settings for your perfect vacation photo. We even noticed a very beautiful wedding taking place right in the main shopping corridor! I think that is a good example of how inviting and romantic the Palazzo feels if you are willing to use it as a backdrop for one of the biggest moments of your life. As everyone notes, the rooms are simply spectacular. First off they are huge. The sectional couch is big enough to sleep two or seat six adults. His and her sinks and a seperate enclosed toilet area are also touches of 5 star elegance. Also, the beds and linens are very high quality resulting in a great nights sleep. Of note too, the rooms are quiet! I can't tell you how many times I've unfortunately heard \"what happens in Vegas\" taking place in the next room. Great insulation was used and the usual hallway traffic noise is non existent. On every occasion we have encountered terrific service by friendly professionals eager to serve. On our first visit, partly to my fault, a champagne flute from a vacation in hawaii was broken by the bellman while he was delivering our bags to the room. (I failed to tell him what was in the suitcase.) Promptly a security person was sent to take a damage report. They were very courteous and professional. About a week later we were credited $100. I was very impressed. You can't mention the Palazzo without raving about the pools--there are about a dozen seperate little enclaves that offer sun or shade throughout the day. Attractive servers were always nearby to take our drink orders without having to wait long at all. I was totally shocked when an attendant came by offering cucumber slices for our eyes! Wow. I have never stayed at a Four Seasons property but that is the sort of service I imagine. Gracious touches such as these are what makes the Palazzo shine above and beyond other options in Vegas. You also can't review the Palazzo without taking note of the outstanding collection of restaurants on site. My favorites are Dos Caminos for delicious mexican fare (and killer Sangria) and Table 10 by Emeril Lagasse; our meal here was delicious and surprisingly reasonable by Vegas standards. All in all, Palazzo has it all. The location is prime and there is just a short walk over a bridge that takes you into the Wynn. The Wynn is nice to look at but it is SO expensive and a bit stuffy if you know what I mean. Relax and enjoy your vacation at Palazzo--you will not regret staying here!

I'm sure I'd have been very happy at Wynn but I have always been a delighted guest of Venetian and chose to give Palazzo a try. I had my worries since I have seem various negative reports not only on TA but other forums as well and luckily none of them proved true for my trip. The hotel staff used every opportunity to greet me by my name and the bellhop taking my luggage out of the cab was keen enough to read my luggage tags and fill it out with my name and proceed to address me by my name instead of asking me. I had a delightful check-in clerk who previously worked at The Venetian and compared the differences and lamented on her preference of The Palazzo. I checked in around 11am on a Saturday and didn't wait more than 5 minutes and received a 40th floor strip view room. The room was great! The room was noticably larger, had slightly better furnishings, and had higher ceilings than the renovated Venetian room I stayed in 4 months ago. Everything worked in the room without any problems and housekeeping was both courteous and timely. Ordered room service and it took about 40 minutes on a Saturday nite which is expected. The pay-per view movie options were the best I've seen in any hotel. There were lots of options including some hi-def options! Room was quiet, didn't hear any noise like some guests have complained about in their reviews. Elevators moved quickly on the high floors and they have 3 separate elevator banks for low, mid, and high floors. I really enjoyed the wide open casino floor and tall ceilings. Weekday table minimums started at $10 but weekends immediately increased to $25 minimums and were full. Lots of restaurant varieties but I only had the chance to go to Grand Lux and visited Dos Caminos twice. Our group really enjoyed Dos Caminos. The location is great with being able to connect over to Venetian quickly or walk out and skybridge it to Wynn, Fashion Show Mall, or TI. I now prefer Palazzo over Venetian because it doesn't have quite all the hustle and bustle as Venetian. Sure, there are many ppeople walking through and taking pictures of the 2 story waterfall in the Shoppes of Palazzo and of the sculpture in the main lobby but it doesn't have the foot traffic of Venetian or an MGM. I find the experience similar to comparing Mandalay Bay and THEhotel. How THEhotel is a little more reserved and a nice little seclusion of Mandalay.

Checkout was quick as well and we only had to wait about 5 minutes. The man at the desk offered to mail the things we needed mailed for us and was very friendly. We had let the valet park our rental car and when we gave them the slip to pick it up, it was returned to us in less than 5 minutes and there was no line at all. Suite The suite was gorgeous and huge and didn't smell of smoke at all. Some of the furniture had scratches and marks on them but nothing major and not a problem at all. Plenty of lighting even with 1 or 2 lights being burned out. The suite was very modern with remote control blinds, a flatscreen tv in the living room, bedroom area, and even in the bathroom. Although you can't see the one in the bathroom from the bathtub which is odd. The view was beautiful, you could see the pools below, Trump, the Treasure Island pirate show clearly, and all the lights at night across the city. Service The service was great, every staff member we ran into was very friendly and seemed like they really enjoyed their job and wanted you to have fun. On our last day we called down to have our remote fixed for the living room tv since it wasn't working (although we really didn't mind that much since there was a tv in the bedroom too). Someone came up about 30 minutes later and when we told them it was probably dead batteries, she told us that the hotel didn't have any screwdrivers to use to open the remote to change the batteries with so she would be back with a new remote. She did come back about another 30 minutes later with the working remote, although we thought that it seems like a waste of money for the hotel to have to buy new remotes every time batteries die instead of buying screwdrivers to replace them... Housekeeping Other reviewers complained about dirty rooms and housekeeping not coming everyday. We didn't find this at all, our room was spotlessly clean and was cleaned daily while we were out in Las Vegas. One afternoon we even returned to find one of the housekeepers cleaning our room a second time and putting ice in the ice bucket and giving us chocolates. Pool The pool area was beautiful with lots of shade from the plants and trees. There's 5 or 6 pools so if one gets full you can use another one. The pool is completely covered in shade though until about 12 and after that its completely sunny and bright so if you don't want to bake in the heat the morning is a great time to go. The whole pool area was clean and staff were constantly walking around picking up towels and garbage. This hotel was overall great and the staff really made us feel welcome. The casino was great too, less smoky than others and had large central walkways to get to places in the hotel instead of having to meander through the entire casino for a mile. The hotel really made us feel safe as well because there were security stationed at each main floor the guest elevators stopped at to make sure you had a room key. If you don't show one you can't go up. When we walked in while a housekeeper was still cleaning she checked our key in the door to make sure we actually belonged in that room and that we weren't trying to steal anything.

It was that good. Chose Palazzo to celebrate my husband\u2019s birthday. Venetian is his favorite, but thought we\u2019d try the new place. First off, I can\u2019t identify with any of the bad reviews on here. Our experience was among the best ever. Personally I prefer a resort with everything on property, like to wander as an option though. We were in awe when we walked into the lobby, it was bright and tasteful. Lines were not long to check in. They asked if we wanted a high or low floor. We got a room on the 44th floor with a view of the strip; it was breathtaking at night to sit on the windowsill and watch. Not a problem at all with elevators, it was on a weekend and crowded too. I can\u2019t say anything bad about the service. We worked with the concierge and they were great. The room itself is modern, decorated in black/gray, larger than many apts. I lived in. Loved the 3 TVs, the one in the bathroom was viewable while in the tub or shower. Since they give bath salts w. amenities too, I checked that out firsthand. Loved the lemony scent of the toiletries. The bathroom was huge. Lots of marble everywhere. The couch was great, a sectional that could fit 5-6 people. Turndown service was great, housekeeping was prompt. I was content not leaving that room. We spent the majority of 1 day at the spa for a couples massage. Highly recommend this, it was perfect, the steam room has eucalyptus scent, perfect for air conditioning congestion. The elevator goes directly to the spa; walls were removed so V is linked to P. It doesn\u2019t have the huge feeling though, very navigable. Most of the shops were open. Nice selection but limited, compared to Venetian\u2019s shops. Of course the Barney\u2019s is the flagship and it is open late on weekends! They had a nice sale going on. Plus, the Venetian shops are a short walk away. The casino was quiet, V was busier. Loved the Rapid Roulette (it was not there last time we visited). Loved the pool and hot tub. The hot tub is great to watch the sun set. Even thought the water was hot it was a great place to hang out. They had water coolers and cups handy to get water, if you forgot to bring a bottle like I did. The bar was a bit crowded sometimes, but I never waited long. Foodwise, did not have to leave the P/V complex to get all kinds of options. The Illy espresso bar rocked! We had gelato at least once a day. It was also a great place to get a light breakfast. We also liked the poolside pizza place, you can get take-out right there. The Coffee Bean had good coffee but you can\u2019t charge to your room, not a good option if you forget your purse. We ate at Carnevino, loved the fresh pasta and extensive wine list. Also tried Morel\u2019s for brunch, huge portions, very very good and they had homemade beignets. It was cloudy so we ate on the patio. I\u2019ll get around to writing reviews for more details. I think we got exactly what we paid for and then some, and it was worth it.

This hotel has a lot of potential as it has all the attributes of a deluxe hotel but customer service lets it down badly. The rooms are very well appointed, pool areas are great and there are some fabulous restaurants. The shows in the Palazzo and adjoining Venetiian are very good and are to be recommended. However some elements of service were far from acceptable, and the hotel's responses to the issues we raised were at times inept. The staff/managers we spoke to were of course very sorry to hear of the problems we had, said that they should not have happened, that they wanted to provide the highest service and so on, but their actions did not match the rhetoric.. On the first night of our stay the guests in the next room very very noisy and we experienced a disturbed night. We spoke to the duty manager the next day about this and he found a different room for us. However he did not offer us anything for our inconvenience, even when we moved all our luggage ourselves to the new room. House keeping service was at best variable and at worst very poor. We stayed a week and in that time we were offered a turn down service on only two nights, one of which we declined as we were in the room. Toiletries were never fully stocked or replenished. One of the house coats was missing. Towels were sometimes badly stained. On one occasion we did not feel that we could use any of the towels that were supplied. When we requested that they were replaced it took 3 phone calls and a wait of over one hour for this to happen, even though I had stated that my wife was in the bath waiting for a towel to dry herself with. This is not acceptable service. On that same day we left our room around mid-afternoon. We retuned at 7.30pm to find that the room had not been tidied, the bed changed, or worst of all the bathroom cleaned and fresh towels provided. We contacted concierge to complain and were assured that this would be dealt with as a matter of priority. At 8.30pm we found that the room still had not been touched so again we spoke to concierge services. They had in fact forgotten to call housekeeping!! So we stayed to confirm that an urgent priority request was placed with housekeeping to get the room cleaned. We were assured that it would be ready when we returned from a show at 12.00 mid-night. We returned just after that time to find that the room had still not been cleaned. Only after complaining to the duty manager was it eventually dealt with, but at around 1.00-1.30am. This was a wholly unacceptable level of service and the worst we have experienced anywhere We heard from other guests that if you tip house-keeping at the start of your stay then you will get a good service. We would like to think that for a hotel of the supposed standards it says it looks to provide this is not the case. I expect to tip after receiving a good service and not before. The duty manager that night did at least cut our rate for that night's stay by half. One final point. We wanted to visit the Grand Canyon during our stay. There so many trips to choose from that we asked the hotel for assistance. They booked us a trip with their recommended company, Gray-line tours/coaches. Our experience however was not a good one and we would not recommend this company to anyone. We expected the Palazzo to haved associated themselves with a company that was in line with the high standards they state they want to provide their guests/customers with. However as with housekeeping this was not the case. The coach driver was surly and bad-mannered and only when we were almost back in Vegas did he try to turn on the charm. Was he perhaps looking for a big tip? The coach itself was okay but none of the video screens worked. Indeed this was the second coach as the first one we were on had to be replaced before we had even left Vegas!! The driver told us that our first coach was known not to be fit for the journey, so why were we even put on it in the first place! We therefore had to wait on a replacement which cut into the time available to us on the overall trip, something that the driver told us in no uncertain terms on numerous occasions. He could only drive so many hours that day so if that meant less time at the Canyon then tough, or if anyone was slightly late in returning to the bus at any of the stops then he would leave without them. So based on experiences our recommendation is don't use this company. This was a special trip to Las Vegas to celebrate 25 years of marriage. We had researched well in advance where we wanted to stay and we thought that the Palazzo would provide us with the \"enjoyable experience\" we were looking for and that the Palazzo says it aims to provide. We are afraid that our overall experience was somewhat tarnished by the poor service we received.", "Date": "July 26, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "san diego", "Title": "\u201cLoved it\u201d", "Author": "sunihuni", "ReviewID": "UR18220676", "Content": "The Venetian is my favorite hotel in Vegas so when the Palazzo opened I decided to give it a try.

Then we found a better deal at the Venetian. When we arrived Friday night to check in at the Venetian, we waited 45 minutes to be told that we were never booked at the 5-star Venetian, instead we were still booked at the Palazzo. I didn't mind this change of plans since the Palazzo is so close to the Venetian anyway. The Venetian front desk also upgraded us to a view of the Vegas Strip. We were delighted and was expecting a great quality hotel room at the Palazzo. At first glance the room looked great. Then I realized the queen size bed was smaller than what I'm used to at home. It turns out that my 6 foot tall brother had to sleep slanted on his queen size bed because it was too short!!! He spent one night on the sofa instead because it was longer. We also had no bathrobes inside our room, despite a hanger that says that our room might be charged $65 for each bathrobe if we chose to keep it. We called the front desk and they told us they don't have enough to stock all the rooms. What kind of 5-star hotel doesn't order enough bathrobes to stock all their rooms? We also had to pay $9.99 for their Internet for 24 hours. The Internet was slow and glitchy. The Palazzo did offer a color printer/fax but it took 10 minutes to print out a color copy of a map of Vegas we found online. The service wasn't bad and the front desk was courteous, but I was disappointed by the quality. I was expecting 5-star quality but barely felt it was better than a 3-star. ======= Pros: Lots of towels, customer service was good, nice flat screen tvs, lots of security, remote control for opening curtains Cons: Queen size beds are too small for anyone over 6 feet, poor linen quality, no complimentary water, noticeable wear and tear in decor, inconsistent housekeeping hours (housekeeping came into when we watched the Phantom at 7PM~ 9PM.

I am SO glad I followed my gut and stayed at The Palazzo! From check in to check out, we were treated amazingly well. We checked in on Friday night and had about a 10 minute wait in the check in line. Our room (Palazzo Luxury) was well appointed, CLEAN and we had a fantastic view of the strip, specifically Treasure Island. On our way into the room we noticed the door next to ours had \"Bachelorette Party\" streamers and got a bit nervous. Upon entering our room, we could hear everything from the party next door. Rather than get settled and have to deal w/ the front desk or our rowdy neighbors in the middle of the night, we contacted the front desk to request a room change. The first person immediately said, \"We are fully committed and cannot change your room. We'll send security up\" I didn't want to cause trouble for the ladies next door and felt awful. At the same time, the bellman brought our bags up (only a 20 min. wait) and we told him about the situation. He recommended that we call back and speak to the front desk mgr. We called back and spoke to Margaret, who was amazing! She totally understood and changed our room to a Sienna Suite! The bellman came up w/in 10 minutes to give us new keys and take our luggage to the new room. OMG...1280 square feet, separate living room, bedroom, foyer, powder room AND heavenly bathroom w/ jacuzzi tub!!! Whoa...

Several weeks go back with no contact from them until I finally called and asked for a status. I was told by their claims department that their investigation was inconclusive and there was nothing further they could do. I asked to speak to a supervisor and was told by him that since I didn't use the in-room safe, there was nothing they could do. I was very upset that they weren't going to do anything for me....for a hotel as nice as the Palazzo is and as much emphasis as they placed on customer service, I would have thought this would have been handled much differently. I would even been happy with them comping my stay, but NOTHING AT ALL! So...I guess the lesson here is don't judge the book by it's cover...the Palazzo is a nice hotel on the outside...but I think there are some deceptive and unethical practices going on inside....and by all means....use the safe that is provided if you plan on leaving any valuables in your room.", "Date": "July 16, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Los Angeles", "Title": "\u201cAmazing Place\u201d", "Author": "mrfood16", "ReviewID": "UR17913051", "Content": "I have been to Vegas four times and have stayed at the MGM, Mandalay Bay, Bellagio, and Venetian.

I travel to Las Vegas 4-5 times a year from Florida. Fortunately I have stayed in many of the best hotels in Las Vegas on the strip including the Bellagio, the Wynn, the Venetian, etc. In short: The Palazzo, to me, is simply an extension of the Venetian hotel. A seamless transition to \"another tower\" accessed from the Venetian, which includes many excellent dining choices. Lobby Area: The lobby area is very clean and serene, a bit cooler in color scheme (blues/browns) and feel compared to the rich colored Italian feel (golds/reds) of the Venetian. Rooms: Standard Room, 2 queen Beds, 7th Floor Pros - Very spacious and comfortable, including the bed Cons- a little dark, needed more lighting. A few minor misses such as hole in the wall, bathroom toilet area light bulb out, all of which was fixed within short period of time by courteous staff. Had to call more than once for maidstaff to clean our rooms, hope they get this corrected soon! Restaurants/Dining: Ate at most of the new restaurants, overall: EXCELLENT As is most Las Vegas dining in the upper echelon of resorts, rather expensive, but to me worth it nonetheless. CARNEVINO real nice porterhouse steak for two, huge restaurant, great service. DOS CAMINOS mexican food - excellent fresh guacamole, queso fundido, and lobster ceviche, great service. Would eat here for lunch. THE CUT also nice steaks, more modern decor and feel. MOREL'S (lobby area) very intimate feel and tasty food. Fresh bread to table, be careful save room for your meal! GRAND LUX hard to beat for value and consistent food. Try the Sangria! Yes, that's right...Sangria! DAL TORO (lobby area) - nice break from the expensive dining choices. Solid choice for italian food, more family style with a twist, lamborghini's in view from your table, also views of the strip. Experienced this a few days after opening, just getting the staff situated and kinks out, everyone trying their best and very helpful. 40/40 CLUB - my biggest dissapointment. Although the club is quite amazing and the best place to watch a sports game (was there during the NBA finals as well) the food is AT BEST average. Maybe they will get this one right as time goes on. JADE - another restaurant which needs improvement, not impressed, love Japanese/Asian cuisine just didn't cut it in my view. ESPRESSAMENTE ILLY - best place for espresso or cafe, gelato, or nice morning breakfast sandwiches, fruit, etc. Casino: More open spaces than the Venetian Square in appearance, almost a \"big box\" with restaurants around the perimeter. Plays music over the speaker system day and night which keeps a nice mood. Feels a little lacking of character, maybe it is just too open, therefore, feeling a bit less intimate. Summary: I really enjoyed the time in the Palazzo. Found myself walking to the Venetian to gamble. Dining was great, room comparable to the Venetian. However, when looking back on my stay, I would not say the Palazzo blew me away on its own merit, rather the Venetian/Palazzo experience in combination hands down has the most entertainment, dining, and shopping available anywhere on the strip. You never have to leave the premises. The Venetian or Palazzo tower to me are one in the same for accomodations.

We had an early flight and arrived in Vegas around 9am and went straight to the Palazzo. The second that the cabbie hit the breaks, we had valets opening all three doors, and by the time we stepped out, our luggage was already out of the trunk. I don't know why, but great valet/bell service really impresses me. Anyway, we gave the valet our last name and she informed us that our luggage would be sent to the room promptly after check-in. We headed to the front desk...which is located right inside the front door...I was thankful to not have to trek through a casino looking for it. And by the way - all the doorways have designated doormen - a feature that you won't find anywhere else in Vegas. Anyway, we gave the clerk our name and confirmation number, and she said that even though it was 9am, we could still check-in. She even waived the early check-in fee and upgraded us to a room on the 50th floor with a view of the Wynn golf course! That's service if you ask me. Then, we headed up the the room. And by the way, we didn't have to wait for the elevators. In fact, we never had to wait for the elevators, and never had to stop at more than three floors on the way up. Keep in mind that I was on the 50th floor AND this was 4th of July weekend. Anyway, when we opened the door to our room, we were amazed. You walk into a marble foyer with a HUGE bathroom on the right - complete with a flat screen TV, double sinks, a huge shower, a jacuzzi tub, a vanity area, and a separate room for the toilet. All, of course, done in marble. Past the bathroom was an area with a King size bed, a flat screen tv, a chair, and two nightstands. Then, there is a small half-wall sort of thing. Beyond the half-wall is an area with a sectional couch that can easily seat 6 and pulls out into a bed, a desk, a table with room for 3, and another flat screen tv. The lightning was great, the furniture was all dark wood, and the color pallet was primarily beiges and browns - very tasteful and elegant. The drapes opened with a remote, and every evening housekeeping came in and turned down the bed, dimmed the lights, put on relaxing music, closed the drapes, left chocolates, gave you new towels, and put ice in the ice bucket. The entire property is a lot like the rooms - pure luxury. High ceilings, tons of marble, the works. Not over-the-top like other Vegas resorts though - very classy and tasteful. The casino is really nice - a good size, with high ceilings, and not too smoky. On the floor above the casino, there is shopping area anchored by a massive Barney's New York with upscale stores like Ralph Lauren, Jimmy Choo, Mont Blanc, etc. that is connected to The Venetian's Grand Canal Shoppes. The pool deck is unbelievable - it's composed of about two large pools, one medium pool, two small pools, and 3 (that I counted) hot tubs - all spread out over a huge area with elaborate landscaping and fountains separating them. There's also a huge bar and cocktail service. Oh, and certain areas of the pools have these cool chairs that lay in the water, so you can lay out on the lounge chair and still be in the water. It's very cool. And if that's not enough, the Palazzo pool deck connects to The Venetian pool deck, which has two large pools and TAO Beach. We only ate at two on-site restaurants - Grand Lux Cafe for breakfast, which was good, but a little overpriced, and Wolfgang Puck's Postrio at The Venetian, which was delicious. I do have a few minor issues with the property - these are the only reasons I didn't give the hotel 5 stars. When we first walked into our room, the headboard for the bed was loose on one side - so it was basically hanging from the ceiling on only one side and looked like it was about to fall. I called priority service and they sent someone up to fix it. But, I think that something like that should have been noticed by the housekeeping staff before we even got to the room. Some of the furniture was a little scuffed. One of the nightstands was missing 3 of its handles. The dresser/console unit under the tv by the bed was missing one of its handles. How is this kind of stuff not noticed? The first afternoon that I was there, I called to have a bucket of ice brought up. The operator told me it would be 30-45 minutes. For ice. I asked her if there was somewhere I could get ice, and she said there was an ice machine on every floor. So I searched the entire floor for ice, and couldn't find it. I finally asked a housekeeper that I saw in the hallway, and she led me to a door that looks exactly like the ones for the rooms. It didn't have any indication whatsoever that it housed the ice machine. No sign, no nothing. Just a plain door. At a place like this, I should be able to have ice brought to my room very quickly - and if that's not possible, I shouldn't have to search the entire floor for 15 minutes to try and find the ice machine. At around 10am, I called priority service to have someone sent up to make up the pullout sofa. I wait 20 minutes. I call again, and tell them that no one has come up yet. She was very friendly, and says she will send someone up right away. I wait another 20 minutes. I call again, this time very pissed off, and inform the operator that we've all been trying to get to sleep and that I've had to call three times to try and get someone up to make up the pullout. She's very apologetic, and says that it usually is about a 30-45 minute wait to have the pullout made up. I'm sorry, but that is just ridiculous. The guy finally came to make the thing up - but 45 minutes is a joke. \"Priority service?\" I understand that combined with The Venetian this is a 7,000 room property - but they obviously are a little understaffed. In review, I had a few minor issues, but I would definitely stay here again.

The other thing that is nice to have in your room after coming in at night from the Vegas summer heat is ice in your ice bucket. Both of these services are included in turn down. Turn down service is part of what I was paying for and I expect to receive the services I pay for. Our room was skipped the first night, which I thought was just an oversight. Upon coming in the second night, same story, no evening service. The Palazzo states if you need anything at all, press the \"priority service\" button on your phone. I did that and it connects you to the hotel operator. I told the operator for the 2nd night in a row, no evening service. No apology and she sounded put out that I was even calling. She did ask if I wanted someone to come up, but it was 10:30pm and I said it was too late. I asked if she could at least make sure we received evening service the next night. She said she would take care of it. Next night, no evening service. I called again. Again no apology for their failures. This night I told them to please go ahead and send up housekeeping. After 45 minutes, I called back and asked for a manager. I told the manager I had been skipped for the third night in a row. No apology. He did have housekeeping there within 10 minutes. A lot of frustration for clean towels. This wasn't the only service problem, just the most annoying. Same complaints as others: huge elevator lines and you end up packed in to an elevator cab. Poor service in the Grand Lux Restaurant. If you bring up a problem, Palazzo employees act irritated that you've even mentioned anything.

The property is a great place - not as crazy busy as the Venetian in either the casino or lobby (which to us was a bonus), and we found that the Venetian and Palazzo both weren't very smoky casinos. As has been stated many times, the rooms are suites - we had a 42nd floor suite facing the Wynn Golf Course (in 4 days the most we saw was 3 groups on the ENTIRE course....$500/round plus 112F heat will do that I guess!) Beds are great, TVs (all three) worked very well, and even had REAL HD....Bathroom was huge. Closet was pretty good....really we felt spoiled. A 5-star room. Could have used a coffee maker though. I have seen a bunch of reviews about elevators. We had no problems at all - never a wait for more than 1 minute. The pool is in the shade much of the morning, but you get full use of the Venetian pool (a quick stroll), and access to Tao Beach if you are so inclined (we weren't, but apparently it's free - many young kids, of the over 21 variety, heading that way). The Venetian pool is much larger than the Palazzo (main) pool, though the Palazzo has....I want to say 5 smaller (pools). I'd pass on the frozen/slushy drinks in the major heat....for $12 the watery syrup that the drinks (of course) ended up made for some cranky folks. The beer was cold, and....$6 I think (might have been $6.50) Only onsite restaurant we went to was the Wolfgang Puck restaurant on the pool deck (name escapes, but you walk right through it on your way to the pool)...excellent pizza, great to sit in the shade and people watch - reasonable prices. We also had coffees and bagels at the coffee stand at the bottom of the elevators - expensive ($3.50 for a large regular coffee), but when in Rome, eh? There is a small gift shop with booze and very light snacks right across from the coffee joint. Check in/check out, very smooth....all in all, I would certainly stay there again for a similar good deal.

We liked the Venetian so we figured we would give their new place a try. What a mistake! The hotel looks beautiful - the decor is lovely and everything is shiny and new. Should you require any basic service, however, you're out of luck. A few examples: -Underaged children running around the hotel and casino at all hours (sorry but Vegas is NOT a family location) -Elevators which never worked and weren't fixed, leading to a wait at all hours -Simultaneously shutting down two of the few remaining elevators for \"cleaning\" at the busiest time of the night on a holiday weekend -Room was cleaned once in a 3-day stay -Naps/sleeping interrupted by housecleaning multiple times despite \"Do Not Disturb\" sign up (yes, they called us/knocked on our door to say they would clean our room, but never actually cleaned it) And the incident which really sums up the Palazzo experience: On the first night we arrived, I realized that all 8 of the bedpillows in the room were filled with goose-down, which, like many people, I am allergic to. There was also a huge down-filled duvet, but no blanket on the bed - not very practical in July in Vegas. I called housekeeping (no easy task since there is no housekeeping button on the phone, nor a directory in the room) and requested that they send some non-down pillows and blankets. Two hours later, there was no sign of any pillows or blankets and I called back. The operator said she would send someone and half an hour later a worker showed up with pillows and blankets. When I pulled off their pillowcases, they were *also* down-filled pillows. I was shocked - how stupid were these people? I called housekeeping again. The operator promised to check it out and call me back. A few minutes later she called and informed me that she had talked to the man who brought me pillows, and that he had checked and the pillows were, in fact, foam, not down. Now I had housekeeping calling me a liar at 2am when I had been waiting all night to get some pillows I could sleep on. I insisted that she send him again, with foam pillows this time. Ten minutes later he showed up without any pillows. He informed me that I was wrong and that he had brought me foam pillows previously. I could not even believe it at this point. Not only had I been denied hours of sleep by the incompetents running this hotel, but now they were calling me a liar - and why on earth would I lie about something like that? Not to mention, I know for a fact that many people are allergic to down and this must be a very common request - which they totally failed to fulfill. At 2:15 in the morning, I tossed every pillow in the room out in the hallway and pulled every single one out of its pillowcase to indicate to this jerk hotel worker that I was not lying to him. Sure enough, every single one was filled with feathers. 10 pillows - all down. The worker grudgingly left and came back 20 minutes later with foam pillows. At this point it had been nearly 3 hours since I made a ridiculously simple request, and I was treated horribly the whole time. I've had better service from the $50-a-night motels I stay at when I drive cross-country. In fact, I don't think I've ever been treated so poorly in any Vegas hotel.

Minusses were I wanted answers to basic questions such as when concierge was open but got wrong information, who to call for housekeeping since phone wasn't set up for an automatic dial, no welcome book/pamphlet in room(type that has ALL info listed not just restaurants, entertainment and room service), some elevators not working throughout 4 nights, housekeeping being inadequate during daytime as in not stocking room with normal allottment of towels/glasses let alone anything extra(excellent at night but they only came 2 out of 4), children running wild--yes wild--throughout hallways and along hallway to elevators(kids/parents were in town for an IPOP convention). One security guard manning elevator banks being crazed about room keys but not for all people just those who actually bothered to listen (they need 2 on duty for such a condensed area and also have to stop letting people loiter once they get past security which then causes a backup just to get onto elevator) , walls are either very thin or people were extremely loud in adjoining room...every morning, Grand Lux staff while pleasant appeared to be overwhelmed at breakfast, furniture in room already stained/missing buttons on couch, room not prepared for our arrival as far as bedding/sheets/pillows for pullout even though I paid for the 3rd person up front. Room service delivering 3 meals but not giving 3 sets of silverware so after calling back to rectify the situation being given the third degree(as if I was hiding a person when clearly 3 meals were ordered) and then after waiting for silverware still didn't get the cream/milk for tea which got cold. Oddly no glasses of water were included which I've had at all properties in LV when ordering room service without having to request it. Maybe this is a new trend. Video checkout was a bit disturbing when there was a disclaimer that 'other guests may view your information' before you clicked on your info. What? I've never seen that posted at any other hotel and have used video checkout consistently. There were more errors as it just showed a place that either opened too soon, this is the normal working out kinks of new place or Palazzo thinks they can get by with mediocre due to location for conventioneers. Also they were overrun with this 'IPOP' group and may have not expected to be so overwhelmed. If one disregards everything in this report do yourself a favor and at least take this advice---don't ever stay at any property when that group is also there. It was a nightmare. My problem is I paid full price for a room in what I thought would be a higher end property when in fact overall it was just mediocre.", "Date": "July 4, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "England", "Title": "\u201cI guess it was alright .....\u201d", "Author": "moo_bear", "ReviewID": "UR17509042", "Content": "... if you like this kind of thing!

Our first experience there was disappointing but we thought we'd give it another chance mainly because we love the restaurants, shopping, and huge gym. However, we were disappointed again. We stayed in the Sienna suite which has two different layouts which was surprising. While the suites were spacious, they are poorly designed with furniture that was constantly dusty and there was a vomit stain in the couch that housekeeping could not properly clean up. Here are the problems we experienced: room service in morning was over 30 minutes late and food was very average, while one day the food was very early and was cold by the time we were ready to eat. Windows in both suites had hand prints and water spots on the sill (have they heard of windex! They were never cleaned our entire stay), shower in one suite was stuck on 120 degree temp (it took 4 calls to priority services and over 24 hours to get is fixed). Housekeeping was never consistent and cleaning was spotty (even with tips). However, all the staff were friendly and seemed to want to be helpful. There is no fridge other than the mini bar fridge by the wet bar. You would think that a 1400 sq. ft. suite could at least offer this for their guest but you have to have medication or formula to get a fridge which is silly. Again the suites had different layouts. One suite has the walk in closet in living room and a small closet in master room. The space could have been utilized better by making the bathroom larger. The other Sienna suite was a corner room and had a better layout, but had an empty room about 120 sq. ft that had absolutely nothing in it??? The bonus was the bathroom was much larger and the view was awesome, but again the windows were filthy! The spa area at the Venetian needs some renovating as the Palazzo side is not fully open yet (only the small gym there). The services were okay yet overpriced as usual in vegas. The annoying thing is that they make you pay an additional $15 to use the gym even if you spend $150+ on a service. The casino is not really a good gaming environment if you like to gamble and we found the tables to be pretty cold overall. However, the restaurants we ate at were wonderful; Cut, Carnevino, B & B ristorante, Grand Lux cafe, Canyon Ranch cafe, and Delmonico Steakhouse. The pool area is nice but really crowded right now so I skipped hanging out in the heat. I would not recommend this resort to anyone who is a seasoned traveler or has an eye for detail.

I'm not sure what qualifies a hotel to be called a \"five star hotel\" but this hotel was everything we had hoped it would be. Access to the parking garage was easy thru the Sands Ave. entrance on the side street around the corner from Las Vegas Blvd. It didn't matter which level you parked on (P1, P2, P3 or P4) because elevators to the casino and/or hotel rooms didn't require a lot of walking to get to. Check in was slow due to the number of people who had tried to check in early cutting in line to get their room keys when their rooms became available after the 3:00pm check-in time. The rooms (and hotel) were beautiful. This was definately one of the largest and nicest rooms we have stayed in anywhere. The room, and hotel was nicely decorated, clean and quiet. The bed was so comfortable we accidentaly slept in until after 11:00am. Our only complaint with the room, (#7-922) which was on the seventh floor was the lack of any kind of view of anything. When we opened the drapes all we saw was the back wall of the casino. The casino wasn't anything special. Other reviewers have complained about it being too small, but we didn't feel that way. It was quiet compared to other casinos, but maybe that was because it is a classier hotel. We ate in the Grand Lux Cafe twice. Lunch was priced very reasonable compared to other restaurants and had a very diverse menu to choose from. Breakfast prices were on the high side, though, and other diners were commenting that the buffet at $15.99 per person was actually a better deal (My waffle and orange juice cost more than the buffet). The hotel staff was very friendly. The maid put chocolates on our pillows at night, and even filled our ice bucket with fresh ice. I wouldn't hesitate to recommend this hotel to anyone. I probably wouldn't stay here again, but only because of my personal preference for \"fun\" hotels with their fake \"plastic\" built in atmosphere.

We just returned from a 3 nt complementary stay at the Palazzo. We checked in on Sunday. When we arrived there was a long line for the general check-in however we had been directed to go to the \"invited guest\" check-in when we made our reservations. There was one woman at our check in and the line was terribly slow. The general check-in was much quicker. When we finally got our turn I made an effort to thank her for the hotels offer of 3 nts complementary. I mentioned that we were celebrating our 25th wedding anniversary. I requested a non-smoking room and asked if anything was available for early check-in. She was ever so friendly and kind and told us we would love the room she had available on the 28th floor. We were excited until we opened up the door and a stench of cigarette smoke smacked us in the face. Then I looked out the window at our view of the air conditioning units and the dumpsters. I called the concierge and advised him that this room was unacceptable. He immediately moved us to another suite which had a view of the Wynn hotel and pools and golf course. It was also very close to the elevators which was nice. This room was smoke free and lovely. We unpacked and called our friends who had stayed the weekend at the hotel on the same promo and decided to meet in the lobby/casino area for breakfast at Grand Lux Cafe. After waiting nearly 20 minutes to catch an elevator going down that was not full, we decided to get on one that was going up and then take it back down to the casino level. This whole process took us at least 40 minutes as the elevator stopped at each and every floor on the way down, even though it was completely full of people. Another guest of the hotel mentioned that four of the eight elevators in this wing had not been working for the entire weekend and they were still not in service. We finally met our friends and proceeded to the Grand Lux Cafe for breakfast. We all opted for the buffet which was nothing special, eggs made to order and a nice selection of fresh fruits, bacon, sausage and potatoes. The usual fare. It cost $15.00 per person which was reasonable. Once we finished our meal we decided to head out to the pool. Our friends had already reserved us a few lounge chairs and we sat at the main pool. This pool water was as warm as bath water and there were many children in it. We did not enjoy the temperature. Also, while trying to enter the pool I somehow pulled a muscle in my arm which got worse and worse as the day went on. The following day we sat at a smaller pool that had a wonderful jacuzzi and small waterfall. This smaller pool had cool water and very few children. It was much nicer. They had water coolers set up in several areas with a table of plastic cups so you could help yourself. This was a nice touch. We never had to wait for drink service and the servers were polite and friendly. The casino was small but busy for midweek. We also played at the Wynn which is our favorite casino and we went downtown which was fun for a change.

There were a few annoyances, but overall we left feeling positive about the resort. The hotel's best two features are the standard rooms and the restaurant choices, if you include the Venetian as an extension of the Palazzo. I'd stayed at the Venetian several years ago, and was unimpressed. I much prefer the Palazzo decor, although the room layout is similar. Service is somewhat hit and miss but better than the Venetian had been when I had stayed there in 2002. Housekeeping, concierge, valet, and bell desk all performed relatively quickly and efficiently. Even a call to security at midnight when we couldn't get our safe open was met with a prompt and efficient response. Things didn't start well when our room was not readied for 4 hours after we'd checked in. After several unsuccessful attempts to get our keys to a smoking \"bella suite\", we finally found an agent who spent about 20 minutes trying to find us something. He eventually offered us a hospitality suite. We checked it out, but my companion didn't care for it. (Great furnished patio with huge outdoor fireplace, but it was 112 degrees, so that didn't make up for the murphy bed and small bathroom.) When we called the front desk to say it wouldn't do, we were advised that our real room was finally ready at 5:30 pm. Our room was a 9th floor 2Q \"bella suite\" with a pool and TI view. The sunken living room area is much more comfortable and pleasantly appointed than had been the Venetian which had felt crowded and fussy. Bed area was comfortable. Closet and drawer space was barely adequate. Two large TVs on the same wall seems at first like a bit of overkill, but since the seating area was as comfortable as the beds, we did find we used both. There is a desk with accessible outlets to plug in a laptop, phone chargers etc. Also a printer that I didn't use. Wired internet access is $9.95 per day. The bathroom is a bit smaller than those at Bellagio, Red Rock and Wynn, but it features a nice separate shower, a small make-up area, separate water closet, double sink, and a TV. Attention men who design bathrooms--You need to add a step or bench in the shower for ladies to use to shave legs and to place extra toiletries. You can't watch TV from the tub since the back of the tub is on the same wall as the TV which was puzzling. Although the hotel seemed to be full, we never heard any noise from neighboring rooms or in the hallways. The Venetian and Palazzo are connected by an indoor shopping corridor, and casino cards, etc all work at both places. The two hotels also share the Canyon Ranch Spa. Be warned: If you enter CRS from the Palazzo side, you'll walk a mile from the check in area to the locker room. The spa was adequate, but I was disappointed after all I'd heard about it. My massage was average, and the steam room and other amenities were smallish and nothing special when compared to Red Rock, Wynn, Bellagio, Paris or Mandalay spas. We ate at Palazzo's Grand Lux cafe for lunch on day 1 in the dining room and at Grand Lux bar on day 2. We preferred eating at the bar than at the crowded and frenetic dining room. We had a satisfying late breakfast/early lunch at Dos Caminos. Dinner at Table 10 was ok but not memorable. My food was good if somewhat uninteresting, but my companion felt her food was oversalted. A dinner of appetizers at the bar at Carnevino the next night, although about the same price as the Table 10 meal, was much more fun. The menu has many innovative dishes to choose from and all were beautifully presented and impeccably cooked and seasoned. We'd made reservations at our favorite restaurant, B&B at the Venetian, for our last night. The food did not disappoint although we experienced a major glitch in service after we were seated. Once we straightened out who would be our server, everything was fine and we left happy. The morning before we left we had breakfast at Bouchon at the Venetian. If you are a breakfast lover, this is a wonderful treat. Unfortunately they stop serving breakfast at 10:30 on weekdays. Although the Palazzo casino is small and can get somewhat loud, compared to the Venetian zoo, the Palazzo's is a zen garden. I prefer the quieter casinos and so I enjoyed it. We did not use the pool due to the extremely hot weather, but it looked adequate. It is shaded until midafternoon, and then there is no shade in the late afternoon. A couple of minor inconveniences: Neither Canyon Ranch Spa nor the Coffee Bean and Tea Leaf concession near the hotel elevators allow you to charge purchases/services to the room.

The casino and resort itself are clean and neat as well. The valet drop off area is separate from the pick up area which is genius! Makes it easy and hassle free. The casino does stink of some flowery smell, just like the venetian which after a while does get old. If you have a sensitivity to fragrance, you will want to rush in and out of the casino like me! (THE BAD) I booked a luxury view concierge level room. In summary, nice feature that has potential, but currently overpriced for the selection of food and times drinks are offered. I personally didn't feel that I got my moneys worth spending the extra $100+ per night for the Concierge Level. Check in is on floor 23 which is the actual Concierge Lounge, which was refreshing, but be prepared, the concierge checking you may offer several sales pitches for the current palazzo and venetian shows. I don't know about you but after a long drive into vegas, I just want to unwind in my room or at a bar, not at the check in desk with a sales pitch. Each time I went to the Concierge Lounge to book a show or dinner they always tried to push their own shows and restaurants, which gets a bit old after a while. On the positive side, the concierge lounge itself was beautiful, with a nice view looking over Treasure Island, and Trump Towers area. The lounge is a spacious area of 6 or 7 Large rooms to hangout in instead of the casino with all the noise. In terms of value, I personally found the extra $100+ a night for the Concierge Lounge a waste of money as the variety of what was offered was pretty slim and the bar was only open from 5-10pm or so. Breakfast is continental, with cereal, some fruit, bagels and toast. The afternoon presentation was the worst. It was exactly the same from day to day: They offered scones, tea, some fruit and biscuits (in the few days I was there, the afternoon trays of food were always full, as they were hardly even touched). Evening presentation and open bar were okay, nothing like the Ritz Carlton Club Levels. They offered mixed nuts, some fruit, and a couple types of cheese, chocolate truffles, crackers and two hot dishes per night (bacon wrapped scallops, teriyaki chicken sticks, mini quiche pizzas, mini beef burritos, mini vegetable egg rolls...) Sadly, the \"hot dishes\" were never really that hot, and tasted more like cheap bar food.

Management handled the situation very poorly and lied to guests stating that heavy winds mandated the pool closure, which we discovered was not true when we witnessed party tables and waiters being positioned by the pool. I expected more from the hotel in terms of their customer service and willingness to please their guests, while being courteous and honest. I called the Manager to express my frustration in being lied to and losing the pool twice and he truly could care less. He basically pointed the finger (which a good manager should never do) and said he didn't even know about it till moments before the event. He also explained that the pool is never guaranteed to use anyway as it is an amenity. He suggested that I trek in the 120 degree weather to a different hotels pool instead. Due to the frustration of the situation, I asked for his assistance in obtaining alternate accomodations elsewhere, and he then made it very difficult for me to leave by imposing a hefty early departure fee, although this was 11 AM, which meant I could have checked out regularly. I shared my frustration with the Concierge and they seemed to share they same sentiment of not giving a damn. I will spend my hard earned money at the Wynn next time. Don't be fooled by the \"newest\" hotel on the block, it still has a lot of issues to resolve, starting from the top down (management).", "Date": "June 24, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "1.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Washington, DC", "Title": "\u201cStolen Property at the Palazzo\u201d", "Author": "CarleneK", "ReviewID": "UR17181946", "Content": "Don't stay at The Palazzo.

My wife says \"How could I find anything wrong with it - it was everything I wanted.\" I can't add too much. I originally chose the Palazzo after hearing the MGM Grand now has bed bugs, Wynn refuses to recognize the economic reality and drop prices, and wanted to stay at a 'newer' property. Checked in was quick, smooth, and polite (mid-week check-in). Parking is a breeze. I normally use Valet, but here, the garage is empty, the garage elevators take you almost adjacent to the room elevators, and the self-park garage security is amazing (real people on every level). Got upgraded without asking at check-in to an astounding suite. Never heard hall noise. Not once. I could hear plumbing sounds from the bathrooms above and below our bathroom when in the bathroom. Walk to Mirage is 10 minutes (lobby to lobby). Ceasar's is 20 minutes. TI and Wynn are across the street. One night we ate at Dos Caminos (the on-property Mexican restaurant). A little loud, but good food. Veggie Quesadillas are better than the Shrimp Quesadillas. Margs are an 8 out of 10 (but I'm spoiled). Personnel were very polite and friendly - to the person. Even dealers lacked the snobbieness typical of other upscale central strip properties. Oh, and the beds are OK - not great. A great bed to me is the new ones by Hampton Inn (and, of course, the Four Seasons properties). The Palazzo beds are a bit hard, lumpy, and the linens are stiff and lack thread count. Still I would not say they were uncomfortable, just not what they could have been. This is where we will stay next time...we typically visit Vegas every 6 months.

Someone should be around to hold the doors for guests handling their own luggage, though, as going though the doors with large roller bags, is very awkward. Decor was generally impressive and constantly kept up, which is necessary for marble and chrome, to keep the look. After hours there were constantly crews buffing the floors, replacing tiles and light bulbs, etc., and they tried to say out of the way of guest traffic, but that is not always possible. All of the staff were friendly, attentive and geniunely outgoing. Registration was very slow. I was with a convention of about 3500 people, and the desk was fully staffed, but still not handling the onslaught. I would expect a hotel to be better prepared for such volume, given that the conference was taking place in their meeting center, and attendees were arriving over roughly two days. I gathered from the conference organizers that the price for food catering of events was stellar. If they were to break it down it was something like forty bucks for a can of coke. So parts of the conference were not inclusive of food, which was a logistical distraction from conference agenda items. In the cases where food was served (lunch or snacks) there were no tables to speak of- a few small ones that looked like bar-boards, but when you serve full lunch buffet with heavy plates, people need tables, not just bean bag chairs. Unclear whether this was the \"hotel\" or the \"conference organizers\" fault. This conference is apparently a multi-year contract with the hotel, so I expect these to improve next year when I am here again. The rooms were among the best appointed I have ever seen, given 20 years of business travel. Electric remote-control draperies on the windows, 3 flat screen TV's (including one in the bathroom, the one I watched the most), large-suite-style layout, very comfortable beds with non-allergenic pillows, and sparkling decor everywhere. Electric drapes are unnecessary and over-the-top (typical Vegas style) but are wasteful of electric power and money, and it takes a half hour to figure out how to use them and find the remote. Which did not always work when I pressed the buttons. Some downsides: room price was about $250, which I don't think matches the reputation of Vegas being an \"affordable\" place to stay. Were I paying for it myself, I'd find it difficult to justify unless it were a honeymoon or something. The tap water isn't much good, but they charge you $5 for a bottle of water. Given the tap quality, they should GIVE you the bottle for free. It is the desert after all, and only a fool tries to subsist on rum and coke. At least they warn you that the \"honor bar\" is magnetic and charges you the moment you move anything, even if you put it back. This makes it rather expensive to read labels on items, to decide whether to buy them. Escalators were not operating in several cases. The design of the complex is such that many of those, traverse multiple floors, so non-operating escalators are a barrier to aging Baby Boomers as well as potential safety hazards. the room TVs apparently were not all on the same service feed; I saw something interesting on the bathroom TV and wanted to watch it while I did something elsewhere in the suite, but could not find that same channel on either of the other 2 TVs. There were so many channels that it took half an hour to find out what was on. While the conference was going on, the elevators to the tower, went on the fritz. A group of us had to leave one elevator car and get into another one, because the first wouldn't go anywhere, regardless of what button you pushed. GIve the volume of traffic, this could potentially be a serious problem if many of the attendees needed to get to a common place, quickly. As far as I know, it never happened again, but the elevators did behave a bit strangely sometimes. And there were light bulbs out, in various random places (not too shocking since the place is pretty huge) including my room. One of my customers (also attending the conference) said that he had a complete failure of air-conditioning in his room and got a lot of static from the front desk about putting him in a new room. But that is a second-hand story. I told him I would get involved if the hotel did not do right by him, but I guess he eventually got what he wanted. Air conditioning in the conference meeting rooms was unpredictable. My own presentation room was cold enough that they should have issued us jackets. My impression of the food was that it was good, where we could get it, but I noticed a lot of food services were shut down soon after \"breakfast\" time, which is a problem for people from different timezones. I went to one sit-down-restaurant, next to the Palazzo tower elevator (one I think owned by the Cheesecake Factory) and the service and food were quite good for the price. Checkout was also very slow; to avoid the line I just left my keys in the room and moved out. I hope to eventually see a folio. There wasn't time to stand in that line, and also cover my conference responsibilities, on the last day I was there. But they did look after my bags, so I could vacate my room on a timely manner, and seemed quite willing to do it for an unspecified length of time- this is better than most hotels.", "Date": "June 20, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "2", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Richmond, VA", "Title": "\u201cDid not live up to the hype\u201d", "Author": "momzee22", "ReviewID": "UR17064618", "Content": "I so wanted this stay to live up to my expectations.

The tub had hairs in it from the previous guests and there was dust everywhere, especially on the canopies over each bed. There were paint spots or something in the tub so we called housekeeping to fix it. They did fix it but it took more than an hour of scrubbing. (I felt bad for the gentleman who made things right.) After that, things did improved greatly. The staff was responsive and friendly. The pool (for the non swimmers we are) was fabulous and did offer the resort/luxury experience we were accustomed to in the Venetian. Overall, it seems like all of the attractions and the ultimate experience are at the Venetian. The Palazzo is an addition and somewhat of an afterthought. The shops are very exclusive though. The extra walking was good for my diet and weight control however. Okay is okay if you are not paying luxury prices. For what we paid (and we received an email promotion), I thought we would have had more. We wanted the luxury experience but the decor, the lack of cleanliness and lack of attractions at the Palazzo were not in line with the superior experience we had at the Venetian when it first opened. We spent three days at at the Orleans a day later and would have to work hard to justify paying for the Palazzo again. Maybe the Venetian is still the top of the line.

The Palazzo does not have that 'scent'....after doing some research on this forum, decided to try it...so glad we did. DH and I absolutely loved this Hotel/Casino. It is first class all the way, but did not feel 'over the top'. We were always very comfortable. I have seen comments that the Casino was small - didn't think so. It also seemed to be very lively - not quiet as some have stated...maybe it is catching on....I also found the machines to be a little looser than those at Harrahs - maybe I just had a lucky couple of days!.. We arrived around 1:00 pm, and our room was ready - we got exactly as requested. The rooms have already been described here, so I won't repeat all of the ammenities - they were all there.

Also, it has not been mentioned very much here, but the two hotels connect on both the casino, and upper level. Most of the signs point you to the upper shop level by going up the escalator...but if you pass the escalator and follow the hallway you come out to Delmonicos, and a couple of other restaurants, and then the Blue Man Group box office....which is right around the corner from the Venetian Grand Lux Cafe, in the corner of the casino...no need to go upstairs at all. Also, if you need to print a boarding pass, you can do it for $1.00 per printed page at the Venetian Business Center, which is just past the Blue Man Group showroom, heading towards the Sands Convention Center.

We both go to Las Vegas for the restaurants, so let me start by saying that I can't comment on the casino or gambling here. There is a lot to say about this place, but I tried to keep it brief. GOOD: Dining -There are some great new places to dine with my favorites being Morels and Table 10. There is also a wine shop with a great selection of reasonably prices bottles. Amazing for Vegas! Rooms- wonderfully spacious and nearly identical floor plan to the suites in the Venetian. Modern decor and soft colors made for a relaxing room (of course we were far away from the elevators). The rooms were very clean, and equipped with 3 flat screens, a connection for my iPod on the small stereo, and internet for $10/day. My iphone was able to access the internet, so I was able to skip the internet charge. Getting around- there is a really convenient bridge between the Wynn and the Palazzo. It is easy to float back and forth between the two. It is also very easy to go back and forth between the Palazzo and the Venetian. You can get the best of all three places within a short walk. BAD: Dress Codes- Beware the restaurants that turn \"nightclub\" in the evening hours. I love to dress up, but my husband is more of a shorts and polo type of person, especially in the hot June temperatures in Vegas. He looked casual, but not sloppy! We were very disappointed that Dos Caminos turned us away because he was wearing shorts! Same story for Dal Toro and 40/40 even though it advertises itself as a casual dining, sports bar. Too bad - we probably spend a lot more on food and drinks than some people spend on gambling. (And yes, he could have gone to our room to change, but it was late and he didn't want the hassle.) Pool - I LOVE pools, especially in Vegas, so I was disappointed with the pools at the Palazzo. Some people like that there are many smaller size pools to choose from. However, I found them all to be murky and dirty and littered with children. There are no \"adult only\" pools here, so there is no escape from the noise and pool toys. If you actually want to swim, none of the pools are large enough to gain any momentum. There is NO SUN before 11:30 except at only one of the pools. It was really far from the bar and chairs fill up super fast! Then, after noon, there is NO SHADE except for a precious few nooks and corners. The only way to guarantee shade is to rent a cabana. I actually preferred the pools at the Venetian. They seemed cleaner and I could find a shady spot when I was ready to. WEIRD Music- the person in charge of selecting the music piped into the common areas should be locked in a tiny room with nothing but his/her music selection! Ok, eighties type music can be fun and nostalgic, but not for 24 hours a day for 3 days! Old Madonna, Prince, Bruce Springsteen, seemed to be in sharp contrast with he understated,modern and elegant decor of the hotel. The music was really loud by the pool, and I thought I was going to go insane if I had to hear another sappy power ballad from 3 decades ago! My ipod was turned way up and I could still hear it. It was also in all common area, and in CUT steakhouse. The waiter claimed it was coincidental, and that CUT was in charge of its own music. Would you like some \"Tainted Love\" with your Wagyu steak? Double Helix- this is the wine bar attached to the fabulous wine shop. It's very strange that a wine shop with reasonable bottle prices would have such an overpriced bar! Glass prices started around $16/ glass and went up from there. People who don't get excited by wine won't pay those prices, and people who know about wine, know that the glass prices are insanely high. Buy a bottle to go instead. I suppose it depends on what your priorities are, but I did not fall in love with Palazzo. I believe the Venetian (although older) is a better option. Book a room at the Venetian, and just visit the Palazzo.

Shopping- Excellent selection with Shoppes at Palazzo and The Grand Canal in Venetian Restaurants- Everything you want and more. Rooms- WOW. Very comparable to the Wynn. Beds are so comfortable you don't want to get out. Bathrooms are huge, TV above sinks. Bathtub is super deep, shower has 3 heads. Roman shades and blinds operated by remote control.

Here is a summary of my experience there. CHECK-IN: There was absolutely no wait to check in, and the front desk agent, Robert, was friendly and helpful. We payed for an upgraded Bella Queen View Suite and received a room on the 46th floor overlooking the strip. However, when we went up to the room, the strip view was pretty disappointing. We were so high that we could only see the strip and hotels from right up against the window. We called the front desk and up came Robert, to show us another room. When we went into that room, it smelled terribly of smoke, even though it was a non-smoking room. Robert kindly offered that if we just wanted to stay in our original room, he would knock off the view upgrade charge and even take off an extra $10/nt as an apology for showing us the other room that reeked of smoke. VALET: Complimentary, which is pretty amazing! They were always quick to get the car brought up to us. LUGGAGE SERVICE: The hotel's biggest problem, in my opinion. When we checked in, they told us it would be 20 minutes before our bags arrived, but it actually took longer and kinda ruined our night. Because they were late, we were unable to shower and change for our night of a show and dinner, and we almost missed the show completely because our tickets were in our bags. Then, after we checked out and needed to hit the road to get home, they told us it would be AN HOUR before they could send a bellman. AN HOUR! We needed to hit the road, and what if we had a flight to catch?! We had too many bags to lug ourselves and they had probably already shut off our keys so that we couldn't do it in two or three trips, as necessary. We called and spoke to a front desk agent who offered to give us an hour later to stay in our room. WOW, THANKS! That was unacceptable so we spoke to a manager who had a bellman sent up right away. ROOMS: Incredible - best standard rooms on the strip, IMO. Huge rooms, beautiful furnishings, amazing clarity on the HDTVs, gigantic bathroom. The only problem was that we didn't get very hot water in the sinks and the shower took a long time to heat up. POOL: Nice pool complex, but nothing special compared to Mandalay Bay, Mirage, or even Wynn. There are lots of pools, and the chairs in the water are a GREAT feature for the hot summers, but overall it was a little bland and they played weird music. The service was okay - we had to go fetch our own towels both days, and they almost never came around to offer us drinks, but they did come around with chilled cucumbers for the eyes every once in a while. CASINO: Small, but with high ceilings and lots of natural light coming in from the lobby in one direction and the shops from the other. Not too smoky (yet). DECOR: Classy and beautiful, but a little bit boring, to be honest. Whereas Wynn has a whimsical cozy elegance about it, Palazzo is a colder, more flashy elegance, with crystal chandeliers and such. It was beautiful, not doubt, but just came off a little too bland and cold. RESTAURANTS, SHOPS, ETC.: Dos Caminos was wonderful (see my review)! The upscale Shoppes at Palazzo are very nice and fairly easy to get around. We only walked through 40/40 Club, but it was very cool, dark and modern, with great sound and TONS of TVs. Overall, I would say that the rooms at Palazzo are about as nice as it gets on the strip, but I would take Wynn as a complete hotel. Wynn just feels more like a small, boutique hotel and has so much more character and warmth. I wouldn't hesitate to stay at Palazzo again, if I got a great rate, but given the choice, I'd go with Wynn.", "Date": "June 2, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Las Vegas", "Title": "\u201cGreat Hotel Horrible Sushi Restaurant\u201d", "Author": "pepprdine", "ReviewID": "UR16549945", "Content": "The Palazzo was excellent. They took the Venetian and added even more luxury and amenities. The only only negative was the only restaurant that has not opened in the hotel due to poor management. One only has to meet the management at this restaurant to find out how unorganized this place is. Nothing like their NY restaurants. The place isn't even open yet and they already have a horrible name in Las Vegas. Typical New Yorkers who come to Vegas to show US how superior they are. The place was supposed to open in January 08 but to date (this was written June 08) the place still is not open. You know why? Because they thought they had a sweet heart deal with PF Changs. Changs was going to buy into their company but once the executives at Chang's took a look at Sushi Samba's financials and then met their upper management they backed out in a hurry. Of course the owners of Sushi Samba had already spent their new found riches from the PF Chang deal only to now scramble to get the project funded. They have cut back a lot on the project do to them running out of money including the management. They try to strong arm their suppliers when they do not have a clue on how to do business in las Vegas. If anyone is looking for a prime location to open a restaurant, give it a year or two and the space that Sushi samba occupies right now will be available. It is a shame too because their two locations in NY are great. The one on Park Avenue has the most knowledgeable General Manager I have ever met. I think his name was Hayes. Unfortunately, they did not bring him out to Vegas. I know a few people that they hired and all of them are saying the place is a disaster.

We had a non-smoking room and that's just what it was the hallway still had the new carpet smell. We're casual smokers but perfer a non-smoking room and we did not smoke in our room. The hotel is in line with the Bellagio and Wynn, very upscale. I rated 5 stars because I don't believe it's like the 4 star hotels in vegas. I can see how some people would complain about somethings for instance...When we arrived our safe wasn't working, but I have to say I called the front desk and within 20 minutes someone was knocking on our door. One of the drawers on the furniture was missing a knob, a couple of light bulbs were burnt out. The tv in the bathroom really is in a bad spot if you like to take a bath you can't see the tv. when someone is showering in the suite directly above you hear it, which was odd because the water pressure was extremely weak, (we didn't hear any other noise from neighbors). These little problems didn't bother us at all. What I didn't like was that there's no coffee maker in the room which is absolutley ridiculous and the coffee shop is really small. Housekeeping was excellent I suggest leaving housekeeping $5 a day we had so many towels,toiletries, clean robes and slippers and the room was spotless. There's two workout rooms you can use one at Palazzo and one at the Venetian, probably the best gym in any hotel I've been at. If you just want to use the gym it's $20 a day. The gym offer free bottled water after our workout my wife and I took two each and brought them to our room, we're big water drinkers. Restaurants: We ordered room service twice each time they said it would be about an hour and it came in an hour, food was excellent, as was the service. We ate at the grand lux cafe one time, hated the food, it's an upscale diner, service was excellent. I forget the name of the restaurant poolside but it's the only one it was excellent, as was the poolside restaurant at the Venetian both are Wolfgang Puck restaurants, excellent service. Pools: lots of them, very nice a wide variety of music playing throughout. All but one pool doesn't get sun until after 12:00pm at the Palazzo guest have access to the Venetian pools as well. Drinks by the pool range from $8 to $12, pool side service little slow. We didn't shop but they all looked open all construction seems to be complete. Casino is a liitle bit on the smaller side but very nice. Service on the floor and at the casino bars was a liitle slow. Guest seemed to be in their early 30's to late 60's mostly everyone was well dressed and very respectful. The thing I like most about the Palazzo is there really isn't any main attractions that brings unwanted crowds except of coarse for the highend shops. If your 22 and looking to party hard you probably like the Palms better than the Palazzo. Jersey boys is an absolute must the show was spectacular! We loved our vacation in general the Palazzo was a great experience the only real thing I hated, was leaving!!

We were on the 41st floor. The Palazzo is very grand and beautiful. It is very tall\u2026I was always impressed with the height of the Venetian, but the Palazzo towers over all the hotels in that area of the strip. We had a wonderful view of the Red Rock Mountains, Treasure Island and could see the pool area if we looked down. At the Palazzo, it is truly about the details\u2026from a sparkly clean room stocked with all the amenities, the prompt service when we called to have our drapes fixed (the roman shade worked but the drapes did not from the remote control), to the level of service at concierge (they will print your boarding passes complementary), to the extremely pleasant and eager to please employees, the turndown service and replacing all our towels and toiletries, even though we hung our towels to dry. The whole experience was fantastic and I was happy that the Palazzo cared about \u201cthe details.\u201d The amenities are very nice, like the TVs, the bed and the super soft towels. We didn\u2019t spend much time in the room, but the time we were there, I absolutely loved it. The bathroom is so very nice which a separate shower and large soaking tub. I liked the vanity and all the natural stone in the bathroom\u2026it was very grand. We have stayed in some nice places and I would say this rates near the top of our list. We enjoyed The Phantom of the Opera. We sat in the orchestra section right under the chandelier. We could feel the breeze as it came crashing down, just right above us. Even though we knew it was going to come down, we still screeched anyway! It was a fantastic show and I would see it again. Next time, I would like to sit closer so I could see better. Since we were there only 3 days, we did not see any other shows. I would like to return and see Jersey Boys and Love. Hopefully I have the opportunity. We ate some really good meals. We went to The City Grille in the Fashion Show Mall. We had a wonderful server and the meal was good. My cousin\u2019s girlfriend and I were not very hunger so we ordered salads and an appetizer while our husbands ordered steaks. My cousin and his girlfriend live in Vegas, so it was nice of them to hang out with us and take us to the cool places. My husband and I celebrated our anniversary on Monday and went to Canaletto in the Venetian before Phantom. Then, we met our cousin and girlfriend for the show. It was a great evening.

We were late to a dinner reservation because the valet \"misplaced\" our car. As a result, we lost our dinner reservation and had to wait an additional hour to be seated. When I expressed these concerns to an Executive Casino Host, he said that they aren't operating up to 100% because of the lack of staff available in Las Vegas. I personally found that hard to believe. Then he basically told me there was nothing he could do for our inconveniences. Maybe this hotel needs some more training or time to get \"up to speed\"...but if you are going to spend some money on a suite and get lack lustre service, to me - it's definitely not worth the money. If you are looking for GREAT service and good accomodations - basically more for your dollar...You could stay at a 4* hotel, pay 1/3 of 1/2 the price.", "Date": "May 23, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Pacific Beach, California", "Title": "\u201cThe Absolute Best!\u201d", "Author": "JakeSD", "ReviewID": "UR16294810", "Content": "700+ square foot suite with 3 LCD TVs.

I think my upcoming trip over memorial day weekend will be my 5th or 6th trip this year and 2008 isn't even half over! I've stayed at many strip hotels and the only one that trumps the Palazzo as far as glitz and glamour is the Wynn. Please note though, that there are a couple deals to be had at the Palazzo and none that I recognized at Wynn. Dining is probably the one important area that stands out in comparison; you can find a reasonably priced meal with good service and atmosphere at the Palazzo. You will also find great service and atmosphere at the Wynn but will pay through the nose. Put bluntly, if you are here at this site trying to make a choice of which is your best Vegas option and money is not a factor--choose the Wynn. If you are not a multi-millionaire choose the Palazzo. After all, the Wynn is right next door to the north and you can always go walk through it for free!! Rooms: They are terrific in just about every way. Large bathrooms with private enclosed toilet and his and her sinks. Soaking tub and seperate shower are included. Marble is used. Mini bar in every room stocked with goodies but you will pay minibar rates. The regular rooms are in excess of 700sq. ft. making them great for sharing with friends. They all include a \"sunken\" living area with a couch big enough for 6 people sitting or two sleeping. The flat screen TV's (three total, one in sleeping area, one in living area and one in bathroom) are big enough, but the really cool \"5 star\" touch is that they are High Definition TV's. And if you are into sports like me you can't go back to watching games in regular broadcast format if you are used to HDTV, Amazing Difference. The beds are comfy with ample pillow supply. Some little cool standouts that are somewhat unique are the remote controlled blinds/shutters and the light up dresser drawers. (there is a little switch on the side that when flicked lights up the glass like you are in a swanky bar. If you have champagne or liquor on the table they have an automatic \"back light.\") Casino: Manageable, meaning not so huge that you feel overwhelmed. Good layout in that the slots and table games are all in a centralized area just off the main elevators. The Sports Book is downstairs next to the main valet. It is small but Jay Z has a sports themed restaurant/club called the \"40/40 club\". Tons of TV's, it was never crowded in winter or spring but I've yet to see it during football season (that's in Autumn, Ladies) I imagine it will be packed then. This club has an incredibly huge menu that offers up such delicacies as fried twinkies and fried snickers candybars! There are also single drinks on the menu that cost more than a THOUSAND dollars for those of you who need to show that you aren't used to having money just yet. I enjoyed myself at this place as you can find food and drinks that are good and priced well enough; but I shook my head at a few strange menu choices. Oh well, to each his own. Pools: They don't have great water features like Mirage or Mandalay Bay, or a \"European Pool\" for that matter, but there are several of them with good drink service and a large central bar with HDTV's. I thought it was layed out well and attractive. Gym/Spa: When I was last there in April the Palazzo's own gym was not yet ready so you have to take this really long underground passage to the Venetian's gym. It is a very nice gym though with tons of free weights and plenty of cardio equipment. Also, there is 50-60ft rock climbing wall for adventure enthusiasts. Every once in a while you would hear loud cheering for someone who was stuck on the wall! I really enjoyed relaxing in the common spa areas even though I didn't get a personalized treatment/massage. There is a package available for a reasonable 20-25 dollar per day fee to use the gym and spa. Dining: Very pleased here with the selection; especially the fact that they have a Grand Lux Cafe that serves up huge portions at a very competitive price. Very much like eating at PF Chang's or Cheesecake Factory. Also, we had a meal at the mexican restaurant--I forget the name but it's just off the main elevators. Great decor and atmosphere and the food and service where excellent. I highly recommend this place because it is not ridiculously expensive. Salsa was great and the sangria was top notch. (I'm in the wine business so I look for good sangria) Mario Batali has a couple of joints at this resort which I look forward to trying over Memorial Day. Shops: Not a shopper but I can recognize good quality when I see it. You have big name brands and more boutique stuff. Pricey, but hey, what did you expect. The shops are very easy to get to as they are just off the main casino floor a hundred yards or so from the elevators to the rooms. This corridor where the shops are (and most of the restaurants for that matter) leads you straight into the Venetian. I much prefer the \"set apart\" feel of the Palazzo, it really is much more manageable and not nearly as hectic as the Venetian even though the two are connected by this corridor. You have the best of both or just your own little haven. Coffee: Hey, most people think it deserves its own category! Sorry, it's not in the rooms so you will have to saunter bleary eyed and with no makeup downstairs to Esspressomere, not too far from elevators in the shopping corridor. Very good coffee and breakfast pastries not to mention to die for gelato and sorbet for desserts. Right next to the main elevators a Coffee Bean is being constructed but was not ready yet in April. I don't even want to imagine how long the lines will be considering it sits right next to the entrance to the room elevators--Yikes!! Overall: Top notch and no reason exists not to check this place out for yourself. Since we go so much and do the Vegas thing (i.e., gambling, we always stay for free so that should factor into this review. I may be more critical if I had to pay $400-500 per nite.) But even then, this place is aesthetically beautiful and graceful. It is not at all gaudy or tasteless. A few of the main sculptures and water features are pure photo opportunities. I always treat service professionals well and they return the favor. You would really have to be a spoiled person not to enjoy what you see here in my opinion.

I asked them what \"right away\" meant and they said \"half an hour\"!. By 6:00 I still didn't have any towels and I called for a third time. I spoke to the supervisor who told me they were very busy, but promised to get me towels right away. I finally got a clean towel at 6:20, delivered sullenly with no apology.

It was the old story, check your luggage and we will call you in a few hours. The best answer to this is \"DON'T BUDGE FROM THE FRONT DESK\" . They will find you a room if for no reason but to get you out of their hair. To the occaissional visitor, many will so say \"no big deal\" . The Venetian/Palazzo must bet on this reaction as the property continues to take advantage of travelers in this way. From my perspective, its a big signal to take my hotel dollars and go find something more reliable. This is not a cheap hotel and guests deserve better treatment. As for the Palazzo itself, this new sister of the Venetian is aimed at a younger crowd who may not really no what real luxury is. The architecture is more modern than the traditional style of the Venetian Hotel next door ( where you could almost think you were in Italy). The rooms are similar in size to the Venetian but the luxury is quite superficial now. Cheap fittings in the room and the bathrooms. Speaking of bathrooms , guys ...advise your significant other to bring a strong flash light if they plan to apply make up in the bathroom ( or the bedroom). The lighting is non existant.

I loved the design of the suites, spacious and modern. I hope the room will be well maintained for the next few years. The only disappointment which I did have was that what the guy had promised me at check-in was different from what the concierge level could provide me. I was promised a late check out at 4pm at the front desk (if the room is available) but was told by the concierge lounge that I will need to pay for that. What inconsistent service! I did upgrade my room to enjoy the view (facing the strip) and the facilities at the concierge lounge. For the additional $100, I thought it was rather value for money. It comes with continental breakfast, afternoon presentation and evening drinks. However, I am rather disappointed to find out that even with the concierge lounge facilities, you still need to pay $35 per day to use the gym and spa! I feel that this is totally absurd! It should be complimentary. Anyway, I really hope that they can improve their offering. For those who just want a clean nice room, I would say Palazzo is quite good.

How often can you say that your reality exceeded your expectations? Not very often. At least not for me 29 times out of 30. This was the 1 time out of 30.

A trip for 2 soon turned out to be 17. Using the \"Name Your Price\" feature on Priceline we obtained rooms for $180 per night. Considering this included a Saturday night stay, it was a fantastic deal. Our limousine (that's the way I roll!) had at us at the hotel at 1:00 p.m. There were very few people checking in ahead of us, and much to my surprise our rooms were ready. I found the front desk staff to be helpful and friendly. As described by so many others, the rooms were beautiful. Tastefully decorated and well appointed, not to mention spacious. We had no issues with housekeeping. Our rooms were always made up by the time we returned to them in the afternoons. The swimming pool deck is gorgeous. Next time I plan on spending more than the token 10 minutes I was there. It's that beautiful. It does take awhile for the entire deck to be bathed in sunlight, but there are sunny spots to be found well before noon. The casino staff are friendly and helpful. Table limits during the day were reasonable ($10 blackjack was readily available). Limits were raised late afternoon. If you are looking for lower limit tables, try Treasure Island across the street. $5 blackjack tables were plentiful. I've read some reviews with complaints directed at security staff. C'mon, is it really too much to be asked to show a room key before approaching the elevators? It's a minor inconvenience at most, and a small one at that if it ensures that only registered guests (and friends) make it to the guestroom floor. I would like to report one minor complaint though. I did see one guest playing slots late one night (well, early morning actually) while in her bathrobe! Yo! Security must have been on a shift change at that time!

The few reviews I saw with negatives I thought were attributed to the rush of opening a new mega-resort. But let me share my first hand experiences with you... After three days here, the ONLY two people that offered any resemblance of caring whether you are here of not, was the invited guest check-in guy (MIcheal?) and the other fellow that greets you and points you to the next check-in person. Both, super nice in ever way. After check in, we scurry up to the room to find it a mess in many ways which you likely will not believe, especially given that they have been open for five months. There is a light bulb burnt out, the phone didn't work, there was a MISSING light fixture on the wall, bath robes missing, a flower vase complete with dead flower remnants and soiled vase, missing knobs on some of the wall switches, and a safe that didn't work properly (wouldn't lock). Well, I stayed in Trump in Chicago a couple weeks ago and noticed a little sign that said \"feel free to keep the robes and we'll bill them to your account\". Pretty standard. But since all we had in Pilazzo were robe hangars, I mentioned it to the staff, hoping not to be billed for it later. They explained there were just out of robes. They did replace the phone. They did not fix the wall fixture, bathroom knobs broken, the toilet running, flower vase, the safe, etc. And let me go on to say this about the staff, in generalization. They don't care. They use the guest elevators even though they have a ton of service elevators....guys with plungers dripping, guards laughing and checking out the ladies for way too long, yelling back and forth to one another...there is MORE professionalism to be found at the public pools in mid-summer! Steve Wynn...buy this place! There seems to be no sense of professional, service-mindedness anywhere. The ash tray in the common areas are VOID of sand for butts. No big deal, but looks like crap. Pour the sand in and emboss it with a big \"P\"? Take some pride in your property! I'm from Indiana, so I'm not some elite Orange County snob socialite...but I do notice, and appreciate, customer service when its there. You will not find it here, or if you do, only once in a blue moon, on an individual, limited basis only. And I'd bet it wasn't taught to them, they're just the naturals. The old timers that opened Venetian seem cool. The new folks are just waiting for the paycheck. Don't get me wrong o the generalization... had one really SWEET dealer from Chicago! The best! Grand Lux restaurant is all you need for every meal. So good. But the casino is dead. The house keepers simple do not care (won't say hello, for example) security guards are everywhere but lean up against the walls, and literally ogle at the hot chicks (which is fine off duty, right?), and spend time lazing around gossiping with other staffers. In summary it was the attitude of the property that upper management simply doesn't CARE about the place. Its like Sheldon is some \"out-of-town-landlord-from-hell\" kind of thing going on. Another way to summarize is that it is more like a Motel 8 or Red Roof Inn than a Wynn, Bellagio or Mirage...for example. I hear the same from other folks I have met on the elevator and in the casino. And for the money, I won't be back. I vote with my dollars on things, ya know. I DO hope they here my message and others like it and turn it around. I wish them much luck. But corporate culture is SO hard to change, one ingrained. They just don't care about anything but the almighty dollar, and when the staff knows this, the customers soon will too. Another example, WiFi costs you $10 a day and they don't tell you that on their website or when you make the reservation or when you check in. Sorry this is so negative. I usually look for more good things to say. But honestly, there isn't much more. The pool area is plain, poorly laid out, and the casino is cold and impersonal. The elevators are GREAT...you might have to wait 30 seconds...max. The water stinks and tastes AWFUL...from high chlorine to heavy salt! Low water pressure and little HOT water during the day.

Our beautiful and comfortable suite (all Palazzo rooms are suites) overlooked the Vegas strip and we could watch the pirate ship show every evening at the Treasure Island hotel across the street (complete with fireworks), from the comfort of our room. Because of our jobs, my husband and I have been fortunate enough to stay in suites at some of the top hotels in the world. When we travel for pleasure to Vegas twice a year we seek out the best of the best. Last year we stayed in the Tower Suites at the Wynn, which has its own separate entrance, elevators, pool and valets, and although there were his and hers luxury bathrooms, the room itself (at three times the price!) just didn't add up to the value we received and the comfort of the suite we had at the Palazzo. The layout of the room, at 720 square feet, was wonderfully thought out. The room is basically divided into thirds. The first third coming in the door is the luxurious bathroom with full soaking tub, large glassed shower, a separate room with the toilet and a dressing table with lighted magnifying mirror and full size hair dryer (not the wall mounted hotel specials you typically find). For anyone who spends time straightening or curling their hair with a hair dryer that is a big plus. The second third of the room is the sleeping area with closet, king-size or two queen beds, plus a sideboard with nine storage drawers and a plasma TV on top. The beds have wonderful, top quality linens and the mattress was very comfortable. The last third of the room was the living room area, which you get to by going down three steps from the bedroom area. There was a l-shaped sectional sofa, a coffee table (with ottoman tucked underneath for additional seating, an armoire with plasma TV, safe and mini-bar. There was also a small table and chairs, plus a desk and printer/fax machine. The layout was not cramped at all. The draperies were controlled by remote control, either roman shades or full black-out drapes. The housekeeping staff were very helpful and they cleaned the room to perfection every day. The front desk staff upon check-in and check-out were very helpful, as was the concierge when we enquired about local events. The pool areas are gorgeous and although all of the pools were not yet open at the time we stayed, there were still more than eight to choose from.

The room was very nice, although the linens will improve with 50 washings or so. The room was clean and there was plenty of storage. No slippers as were in my friend's room, but she didn't get a box of bath supplies (shower cap, Qtips, etc.). My room had three shower heads (two halfway down the wall); my friend's room did not. Odd. Ate two meals in the Grand Luxe. Dinner was average, breakfast better. We used the food court in the Venetian for pool lunches (there is no food service at the pool, although there is a small restaurant). The stores are absolutely gorgeous. One of the most beautiful Ralph Laurens I have seen, a Burberry, Ferragamo and other big names. A few complaints: The pool was extremely crowded with 20- somethings in large groups generally creating chaos; for some reason I expected an older, more upscale crowd. Also - a small complaint but the clock in my room was off. It took five calls to get it fixed (it was off by hours and minutes, and you had to unscrew the back to fix it). I wake up a lot during the night and it drove me crazy. No bill under the door at the end of the stay (not sure if that is a Las Vegas thing or not, but the line on Sunday to check out was long so we just left). Also - the valet loaded taxis one at a time despite the huge line. When I suggested that maybe they load more than one at a time, well, that didn't go over. If you need to get anywhere, leave plenty of time for taxi lines. Also, the Sports Book at the hotel is just that - it is not a Racing Book too. So to place a last minute bet on the Kentucky Derby I had to run over to the Wynn - a half hour round trip (there is a Race Book at the Venetian but I was told it was further away). The hotel is attached by a bridge to the Wynn - a short walk away. That hotel was much more to our liking and we gambled and ate there. The casino was more attractive and the folks there all knocked themselves out to be nice to us, even when they heard that we were not staying there.

I have stayed at most of the higher end properties in Las Vegas (Four Seasons, Wynn, Venetian, Bellagio, theHOTEL) and many others as well (MGM, Mandalay, even Tropicana once), and Palazzo still has some work to do in my opinion. My room was on the 36th floor. The good: as others have noted, their rooms are very quiet. I know both rooms on either side were occupied, but I never heard a peep at all. Nice flatscreen TVs. Free wireless (not promoted as such but I was never charged for it). Daily newspaper hung on door. Maids respected the \"do not disturb\" sign. Deep safe that easily accommodates a laptop. The bad: scratchy linens, cheap and too fluffy pillows. Poor water pressure. Rip-off mini-bar that automatically charges you if you look at a drink. Noticable dust in areas that the maids don't clean very often like the dresser drawers. Grand Lux Cafe breakfast buffet not that great - walk to Wynn in 5 minutes and pay extra $2 for the best breakfast buffet on the planet. The ugly: the pool was closed May 1 for \"high winds\". While it was somewhat windy that day, I suspect the closure had more to do with the numerous construction workers going in and out of the pool area with ladders, ductwork, etc. They directed us to the Venezia Tower pool, which was open as it is enclosed on all four sides. However, it is very small, half in the shade, and of course there was not an open seat to be found anywhere! Very expensive drink menu too. Side note: had a basic massage at the Canyon Ranch spa, and it was okay, not great. Spa at Four Seasons is much better and about the same price.

I got a rate of $140 on Priceline. We parked underneath in the garage, and went to the lobby. A host greeted us and walked us to the check-in representative. Check-in was fast, and they gave us a sheet of dining and gaming coupons. There is a security guard near the guest elevators who asks to see your room card on your way up. The room (16-917) was fantastic. 3 HD Flat Panel TV's, wonderful tub and separate shower, separate sinks, amazing bed, sunken living room with a DVD player, large deep safe, printer/fax (that did not cooperate with my laptop), remote control blinds, excellent temperature control...I could go on and on. It just had all the space in the world, and everything was modern and comfortable. For those that hate noise, this was the quietest stay I have ever had.

The pool is very nice, though most of it does not get sun until noon or later. The casino smells wonderful, and I could not even get a hint of smoke. It is easy to get from Palazzo to Wynn, Venetian, Treasure Island and the Fashion Show Mall. The underground parking is very easy and puts you into the casino in no time.

I'm not a gambler, so I can't attest to anything to do w/the casino, other than it seemed pretty empty. Not as smokey as others in Las Vegas, but I suspect that has more to do w/the fact that it hasn't been open long enough to get that way. The Shops area also seemed pretty deserted the one time I walked thru, though there were more stores open than I expected. My biggest peeve w/this hotel is the guest room plumbing. Never, in all the hotels I've stayed in over the years, have I been in one where the plumbing in the guest rooms is as loud as it is here. If I have to turn up the volume on the tv in order to hear it over the sound of the shower running in the next room (or 'suite' as they insist on calling them here), as I did, then there is a serious problem. (I apologize to whomever was next door to me & had to listen to my shower running @ 6am) Check-in is a rather convoluted process that requires one to first identify oneself, & the reason for needing to speak w/someone @ the front desk, to a roving hotel staff person. He/she then goes over to a registration person for a brief discussion before allowing you to approach where, of course, you then must re-state your request. The lobby area is huge, w/marble everywhere, & loud music blasting throughout which means all conversations w/anyone in this area must be SHOUTED in order to be heard. Suggestion to hotel mgmt-TURN THE MUSIC DOWN!!!!!!!!!! Be warned, this is a hotel that has rent-a-cops stationed at the guest elevators to harass anyone trying to use them; the first time I tried to go up to my room, not only did I have to show these people my key, they also demanded to know what room I was in! Keys did not work on my first trip up, after having successfully gotten past the rent-a-cops, which meant trekking all the way back down, across the casino, & repeating the above process to once again approach the registration desk for a new set of keys. This also meant dealing w/the rent-a-cops again, as well, even though literally not 10 minutes had passed. When I came back from dinner that night, 1 of the new keys had already deactivated itself & no, it was no where near my cellphone. The decor chosen, as others have pointed out, actually gives the impression of a hotel that is much older, run-down, & dated than it is. They actually managed to dig-up a cordless phone that I would swear is straight out of the 70's! It took me 3 trips up & down the hall to find the room w/the ice machine in it since the wall sign for it was tucked behind a pillar & not well lit. I don't know that all the elevators to the guest rooms are working yet-certainly, in the tower I was in, I ended up in the same elevator every time I went up or down. They are not only incredibly slow, but also very noisy to the point that, as others also remarked at one point, you do wonder whether it's safe to be in them. Like the suites @ the Venetian, the suites here feature a sunken living room. Someone must have decided that a green nightlight was in order for the 2 steps that lead down to the living room. The problem is that I could not see any way to turn it off @ night & that little light gives off an amazing amount of light in what is supposed to be a darkened room! Control for the A/C is wedged into a corner behind a bedside chair which made it difficult to get to. Doors are incredibly heavy & even when holding on to it, when exiting the room, it's nearly impossible to keep the door from slamming. My room overlooked Sands, the Wynn & it's golf course (which is very nice), but unfortunately, also all the A/C units for at least one area of the hotel. Even though I was on the 17th floor & they were quite a few floors below, it was still possible to clearly hear the roaring of the machines all night; same w/planes taking off from the airport. I give them points for actually putting a work desk in the living room area since so many of the LV casinos don't, however, it has a glass top on it & an optical computer mouse doesn't work on those. In addition, there is a rolling cart sitting beside the desk w/a fax machine/printer on, but since it is squeezed in between the desk chair & wall, & in front of the window curtains, there is a overwhelming feeling of being squeezed in when trying to use the desk. Remote control for the tv in the living room was very sluggish in changing the channels-I'm not sure whether it needed batteries or just didn't work well w/the tv in the room. Ice bucket they provided is very small & the glasses in the room don't really fit into it for getting ice out nor did they provide tongs to use instead which left no other option besides one's hands. Bed is a pillow top, but there is no mattress pad on it. In addition, they have put a flat sheet on the bottom which, of course, ends up in a wadded up knot under your back the first time you turn over. Note to hotel mgmt-invest in fitted bottom sheets. Bathroom is quite large, though it took time to figure out how to get the lights turned on in there! Very large & thick bath sheets, along w/large bath towels, but only 2 of each; same w/handtowels & washcloths. Large towel rack over the tub, but the only way to get near it, especially if you want to hang towels on it to dry, is to actually climb into the tub. Door to the 'wc' compartment will not stay open on its own. Double sinks w/granite vanity, but there are already stains around the bottom of the faucets (ick!). Toiletries are from Agraria & are 'lemon verbena'. If, as a little girl reading 'Little House on the Prarie' you ever wondered what Miss Beadle's 'lemon verbena' smelled like, get a can of Pledge furniture polish & you'll know. I think the hotel is trying to be 'green' w/low flow water fixtures; unfortunately, this has translated into very low water pressure & the water temp in the shower fluxuated constantly while in it which was very annoying. The only restaurant I tried @ the Palazzo was the Grand Lux Cafe. As is typical for a single female diner, they tried to seat me at the smallest table they could find initially-it even had only 1 chair! Then I had to send my lunch back as it had been prepared incorrectly. Though the waiter apologized & took responsibility, there was no reduction on the check, of course. Meeting space for the Palazzo is actually the Sands Convention Center which itself is @ the Venetian which translates into another hike to get to it. Those attending our mtg either from the local area or staying elsewhere were not happy to find out, upon arrival @ the Palazzo, they were actually at the wrong place. Meeting rooms are not very well soundproofed-we could clearly hear the group next door to us & I would assume they could clearly hear us, as well. Banquet staff actually bus the tables in the meeting room by dragging around gigantic trash bags vs. using trays, which I found very odd & not very hygenic. Wi-fi in the public areas was difficult to access; multiple attendees had problem getting connected. I give the Palazzo points for actually providing newspaper delivery to my room in the morning; many of the big casinos in Las Vegas don't. However, no copy of the hotel bill slipped under the door & I had to argue w/the staff person who checked me out to see a printed copy of the bill. She tried to fold it up & stick it in an envelope w/o my ever seeing it. When I asked to see it, she said, 'Why? It's just the room & tax & you already paid that', as the woman next to me was arguing w/another staff person about charges on her bill that didn't belong to her!

I immediately went down stair and asked to speak with Mr. Santos and was told that he was too busy to assist me at this point, Finally the front office manager showed up, by this time I just want my money back so I can just sit in the lobby till daytime since it is almost 4am. She finally offer us a suite at the Venetian w/ $100 off. When I woke up in the morning I noticed that my room was overlooking some parking lot with no view. Wow.

Overall, it was a very good experience, but somewhat underwhelmed after all the hype. Compared to the Venetian, I think the Palazzo is unnecessary and indistinguishable from its predecessor. The room was very nice and clean, and huge. The 3 flat screens, and a living room big enough to have a good size party. The best reason to stay at the Palazzo is the room, which is a modernized version of the Venetian room w/flat screens and remote controlled curtains. Some minor quibbles: our first impression was a little disappointing, given that the front entrance is cluttered and obstructed by ongoing construction. Inside the front entrance and lobby just felt like an afterthought, instead of something with a distinct personality or theme. But maybe that's not that important to most people. The shops and restaurants are upscale, but the layout is hard to navigate, and kind of far away from everything else, unlike the Forum Shops at Caesars or even the Venetian. The casino is small, but that wasn't a big deal for us.

We decided to experience the Grand Lux Cafe for breakfast and the servers needed training in customer service. We did not get what we ordered and the waitress was leaning on the podium instead of waiting on us. No value in that meal. I had a travel shock when I sat down at one of the bars to play video poker and as soon as I took my money out and placed it in the machine, I was approached by a man. This man came up to my side and took out a ring and said it was a diamond and gold ring and wanted me to buy it. I was i'n shock and said, \"Go away.\" He disappeared as if into thin air and nobody else at the bar knew what happened. This is one of the most scary travel situations I have had because in one split second I could have been robbed and he was so discreet that no one around me knew there was a problem. I realized that big money and expensive places are a magnet for people who might want to take advantage of you. It doesn't matter where you are in the world, you're vulnerable. My greatest shock is that this person could be so brazen in a casino where there are so many cameras watching the gaming floor. When you are taking out your money or putting it away I guess you just have to beware The Shops of the Palazzo were starting to open and some of the most high-end brands in the world will be available soon. Just fabulous if you're ready for shopping. I spent some money at Barney's of New York which just opened. The front desk check in was excellent and all the staff members at the bars were extremely attentive and excellent. We highly recommend either of the bars with video poker machines as great experiences. The pool was under construction and we missed that opportunity. We'll have to come back. There are some wonderful world-class dining opportunities surrounding the Palazzo and so even though we couldn't brag about breakfast, you'll have great food to eat anywhere you select for lunch or dinner. Getting to the spa was not convenient at all and a waste of money for the 1 hour we spent. We suffered with swollen eyes the next day because of either mold or too many chemicals at the end of the day in the steam room and whirlpool spa.

The staff at the whole hotel is fantastic. Very helpful and friendly. The beds were so comfortable and the pool was fantastic. The sun did not hit the full pool area until around 1:00 but you could chase it at the other pools at the Venetian. We were down there everyday around noon and had no problem. The drink service was also excellent. If I had one complaint it would be that there is no coffee maker in the room so you have to go down to the lobby. Normally that might be okay, but the Lux cafe bakery where you get the coffee is mayhem. The line up is out the door and there is no organization. They need to take some lessons from Starbucks. I noticed that there is another coffee place going in closer to the elevators but it wasn't open yet. That may ease some of the pain. The Grand Lux restaurant is excellent.

We flew down for a a one night weekend in Vegas. I've watched the hotel be built and was amazed at the massiveness of the tower. I stayed at The Venetian years ago and was happy with the room. The non-casino areas of the Palazzo are very nice. The reception atrium is beautiful with amazing flower arrangements and natural light. We had invited guest check in so we did not have to wait, but there was a line of about 20 guest checking in at 2PM on a Saturday. As is common in Casino design these days, after checking in, you have to walk through the entire casino to get the hotel elevators. The Casino is average to below average. There is little detail to the finish work in this area of the hotel. There is no natural \"meeting place\", bar, etc. in the Casino area. The slot machine volume is cranked up which is opposite to the Wynn hotel where you can barely hear them. However the hotel is so new there is hardly any smoke smell in the Casino area. The elevator banks are very crowded in this hotel as it is so large. Our room was on the 35th floor and we usually had to wait about 2-3 minutes to get a car up or down. The guest room is the best part of the hotel. We had a standard suite facing the Wynn Golf Course. At this point I can care less about views of the strip, not that they are very good from this part of the strip anyway. The window looking out was small-ish compared to new hotel designs and was very dirty. The remote operated roman shades and curtains were very nice and worked well. The room is exteremely functional for las vegas. Probably the best layout of any Vegas hotel. It is almost identical to the Venetian. The bed is in the \"upper\" area and faces a 42\" LCD television. It is extremely comfortable to prop up an watch TV in bed. The halogen lights are great for bedtime lighting as well. The large sectional couch is comfortable and has a huge coffee table which is great for having a drink before heading out. The 37\" LCD in that area also is well positioned. I had some problems with the safe which is located in the living area console, but finally got it working. The desk is large and the 4' round table feels very large and sturdy. The bathroom is large, but not as a nice as the Wynn bathroom. The shower does have two auxillarty heads at torso level which is a nice touch. Water pressure was great as was temperature. The only problem with the room (which is very apparent in the bathroom) is the lighting outside of the bed area. It is not well-lit in the bathroom or living room. In fact, the lighthing in the room corridors is too dim as well. It's not a big problem but you definitely notice it. The other detail that was strange was the large square mirrors in the elevator areas. They are convex \"fat\" mirrors. Which is strange in a city that people really get dressed up in. We ate in Dos Caminos which was delicious. The service was excellent as well. The pool is also lacking. There is absolutely no poolside foodservice at the Palazzo, yet. You literally have to walk almost 1/4 mile to the Venetian to get a bite. You can tell that they didn't have a lot of pool space to work with at this hotel and it shows. The pools feel small compared to the number of chairs and guests. The main pool at the Venetian is much nicer. The pools however were warm and the water clean. My biggest gripe with the hotel is the Casino. It has no character and can only be described as a really really big room. You're not going to get lost in it, but no matter what direction you look, everything looks the same. It reminds me a lot of the Alladin when it first opened. Big and bland. There is no live music to be found anywhere. There is no vibe. At least there are no Card Shuffling Machine blackjack tables or 6-5 single deck games. Most were 8 deck shoe games with about 1.5 decks cut off. There was a 3-2 single deck game available occasionally for $50, but it disappeared or turned to $100 at night. Most games were $25 minimum at night at $15 during the day...pretty typical for the Strip. All and all, the hotel was more than worth the $150 we paid, but it is nowhere on par with Bellagio, Wynn, or even the Venetian. I like this end and side of the strip since the Fashion Show mall is so close and you can avoid walking on the strip to get around. I gave the hotel 3 stars. This is obviously nicer than a 3 star hotel located in an average city, but in Vegas, they standard has become increasingly high. This hotel could be a 4 star which I would give to the Venetian if they upgrade their \"free\"entertainment and ambiance in the Casino , and finish the rest of their services in the pool area. Otherwise, this is a great option for this end of the strip, especially for under $200.

It is in a great location on the strip, handy for the Venetian, The Wynn and the Fashion Show Mall. Checkin was easy and efficient compared to other mega resorts, the accommodation is grand, comfortable and spacious. My complaint along with other reviewers is the housekeeping service, this really does need improving, by 4:30pm no maid service had been and we had to prompt them to service the room as we were seeing the Jersey Boys at 7pm, just not good enough! Also houskeeping is not that good or thorough, on checking in we felt that the carpet in the suite had not been cleaned and a spillage by previous guests on the marble steps between the bed area and the living area was not removed for the entire stay, these things are just not good enough for a 5 star property and the management of the Palazzo need to take notice of it's paying guests or they will loose them. There doesn't appear to be anyone checking that the standards are being met by the maids, this agian is not good enough in a 5 star resort and doesn't seem to happen elsewhere. The pool area had only just opened when we were there and not all services were operational, however, it was nicely done and more spacious that you would have thought. The spa has also now opened and looks to be pretty good (but then most are in Vegas!). There are still a few shops to be opened but all restaurants appear to be available and there is really a good choice, as you are so close to the Wynn and the Venetian the choice is first class. The casino is light and airy with space to walk, the design is excellent and an absolute must is the Jersey Boys, a truly excellent night out!

After trying to explain our situation they let us use the phone in our 1st room. They explained to go down the hall and someone would meet us at our second room. 30 minutes later we were greeted by a friendly staff member who we then told we dind't want this room due to some chaos next door. We then were moved to a 3rd room up a few floors. Once in the 3rd room the toliet was broken and the safe wouldn't work. The employee who had helped us move had called to get those things fixed and left us in the room. 1 hour later the man came to fix the toliet. Still waiting on the people to fix the safe, one of them arrived about 10 minute after the toliet was fixed. In turn we had to wait for a second man in case there were valuables in the safe which I understand. Not expecting for the 2nd man to show up 45 mintues later. Once that was all situated I wanted to shower and get down to the tables. We had no tolietries. For a 5 star hotel that is absurd. It took us over an hour to receive the shampoo, conditioner etc... I was unable to get into the shower until midnight. I have never had any issues in Vegas as bad as this. To add to it all we decided to have lunch at the Grand Lux in the hotel. We would have had better service at a Denny's. They messed everything up and we were there for over 3 hours FOR LUNCH. I was given a $100 credit for food and beverage. We used that at Grand Lux and in the room. We then checked out of the hotel and everything was fine on that Sunday. The food and bev. comp covered it all. I received my credit card statement and they in turn charged me the $100 we had spent at the restaurant and in room.

We only stay at 5 and 4 star properties like the Four Seasons or Mandarin Oriental, so I can attest that the hotel definitely meets that level of expectation. Pool deck opened on April 5, the first day we checked in. Thank goodness, as our 3 small children wouldn't have been very happy with trekking to the Venentian. None of the cabanas were ready, and one pool wasn't yet open, but 4 were, as well as two spas. The kids LOVED the pool area, as did everyone else. Food service and complete bar service not still available, but should be soon. Room layout and decor were lovely and very practical. Great soundproof and lightproof windows. No noise problem at all--we travel with a white noise generator and didn't need it. The computer access was perfect, and the fax/printer was very useful. Great assortment of restaurants--between Palazzo, Venetian, and Wynn, the greatest concentration of top restaurants are at this end of the Strip. We loved Grand Lux (Palazzo), Dos Caminos (Palazzo), Bouchon (Palazzo) on property. Off property, we ate every breakfast at the Wynn Buffet (superb!). We also had the prixe fix dinners at Alex (Wynn, world-class superb!,) Picasso (Bellagio, very good), and Robuchon (MGM Grand, impressive!). The hotel, shopping, and casino are about 85 percent ready. Some slight construction in areas, but nothing too distracting. Check-in wasn't perfect--we checked in at 12 and were told are rooms needed to be cleaned and to return at 3pm. At 3, they were still not ready. I did not accept this as an answer and basically sat at the fountain and called the front desk until I found someone who found us a room. We were upgraded to a better view and in our rooms by 3:30. It helps tremendously to be politely aggressive. Minor annoyance: The perfume that permeates the air at both the Palazzo and the Venetian. Everyone in our family has allergies, and my son has asthma. We had no problem with the scent, it was just annoying. Of course, not nearly as annoying as the odor of smoke which is EVERYWHERE in Las Vegas. It can't be escaped--until you leave Sin City. The wonderful thing about the layout is that you can easily access other parts of the hotel by walking through the shopping concourse instead of the casino. No one tells you this, but it is easy to figure out.... Hope this helped!

It got off to a bit of a rocky start, and I will probably go back to the other side of the street on my next visit, but overall there were more pluses than minuses at this beautiful new property. Check-in was the biggest negative to my stay, because the room they assigned me had a broken thermostat. When I entered the room it was 83 degrees and rising, and it was set at 60, so clearly there was a problem. I called the front desk for help but sat on hold over 5 minutes before giving up and dragging my luggage back to the lobby. That was annoying, but I was doing my best to be patient until the person I explained my dilemma to told me there were no more rooms available and asked me if I wanted to go back to the room to wait for maintenance. I wasn't about to do that, and only after I started to become visibly annoyed with the entire scenario did he find me another room. I honestly expected more from a 5-star property and it is very disappointing to have to lose your cool to get better service. I had to laugh when I got to my 2nd room and the view outside my window consisted of a very high wall about 5 feet outside the glass. If I craned my neck a certain way I could barely see a sliver of blue sky, so I kept the drapes closed the remainder of my stay. If you don't want that view avoid odd-numbered rooms below the 8th floor. At least the room was cool, though, and like everyone else has said, the furnishings are lovely and new. The HD-TVs are great, and there are extensive programming choices. I also loved the robes, bedding, toiletries, and the bathroom. One very weird thing I noticed was that the tap water tasted really, really terrible. Be sure to stop at the souvenier shop just before the elevators and get a couple of bottles of water...it's much cheaper than the mini-bar. I wish I could comment on the pool, but it still wasn't open when I left April 1. Last I heard, it's supposed to open in the middle of April. I did have room service one night (pizza) and it came faster than they said it would...it was also very delicious and reasonably-priced.

Sadly, I have to report the same. I definitely don't like to nit pick the small things, but when staying at a resort like the such, top notch room appearance is expected. It looked like the room was rushed to completion. We found several areas of the carpet with noticeable large paint stains on them. Paint was also found on door hinges and knobs. A large section of baseboard trim was missing in the bathroom. The room was not as clean as it should be. The window had a bunch of smudge marks on it. Sticky soda mess was on the table.

I paid $179 for a suite through an email promotion and stayed for 5 nights. I had emailed ahead to inform them that it was our wedding anniversary and also my wife's birthday the week before, so asked if it would be possible to get a room overlooking the strip. I received a response to say that they would add this comment to the reservation but could not guarantee anything. I politely asked when checking in whether a suite with a view was available and the friendly gentleman (Robert) behind the desk was very obliging. We were upgraded to a beautiful suite on the 41st floor overlooking the strip. This is the best room I have ever stayed in and I am a frequesnt traveller to many destinations. Being brand new it was tastefully decorated and came with 3 flat screen TV's, lovely bathrobes and slippers and all the amentities you would expect from a high class resort. The actual casino is relatively small compared to the established names but that was also a bonus as it didn't take a hour to get from the lobby to the suite, navigating our way around was easy and noise level was not excessive. Being joined to the Venetian offered the best of both worlds so serious gamblers can walk from one to the other via the fantastic indoor streets. Our room was cleaned each morning and in the evenings the bed was turned down, a chocolate placed on the pillow and a general tidy up was performed. The staff were all very helpful and friendly in every way. It's true that the pool is not yet open (should be soon though) and a couple of the shops aren't finished but it did not stand out as being incomplete and it did not affect our stay in any way. Compare this to our stay in the Bellagio on the last 2 nights of our holiday and I would say the Palazzo wins hands down. The service was also good at the Bellagio but the rooms don't compare for the price. We couldn't check in until 6.30pm and as such missed a 7pm dinner date with friends, our room wasn't cleaned until after 2pm each day, we were placed at the back of the hotel and it was so much busier and noisier in the general public areas.

Now why didn't housekeeping notice the dried, smeared, white stain on the dark brown velvet sofa? It really stood out. Since I heard talking in the hallway, I poked my head out the door to find a HK supervisor. I informed her of the stain. She wrote something down and informed me that they wouldn't be able to get to it today but, that it would be taken care of. The next day it was. I agree with another poster that housekeeping needs to do better. On my second night, I received no wash cloths and dirty glasses were left in the room.

It really was anything but pleasant. Housekeeping was very lax with many missing items (i.e., towels, do not disturb sign, robes and slippers, etc.) upon our arrival. Housekeeping did bring those items after about 8 hours. There obviously was no attention to detail as there were things such as masking tape still in place from prior painting, tape residue on things, a mysterious black sticky substance at the entrance to the bathroom (which the housekeeper and housekeeping supervisor had no idea nor inclination as to how to remove), continued missing towels (somedays had 10 washcloths, no hand towels or no washcloths, 6 bath towels). We had a lightbulb burn out in the separate toilet area. It took over 12 hours to replace a lightbulb thanks to the electrician who arrived at our room at 11:30 PM. He questioned why no one else could have just changed the lightbulb before calling him. We were glad he came, however, as he figured out what the mysterious black substance was that eluded the housekeeping staff. He looked at it, took a razor blade out of his tool kit and scraped the substance off. He said that it was silicone caulk and that being waterproof, it was never going to wash off (which is all that housekeeping did). He was very pleasant, but what he did was definitely not his to do. We received many \"I'm sorry\" responses from the front desk, but no action. The front desk manager gave us her business card to be able to contact her directly. Nice touch, but we were not able to do so because the hotel operator did not know who she was despite us telling the operator her name and that there is no such thing as voice mail for that person. The operator persisted in \"sending us into her voice mail\" only to be connected to the front desk who said that there was no voice mail and that the front desk manager was busy. No call back. The good part of the stay was the excellent service by the desk security staff member when we inadvertently left behind a couple of items. He sent a security guard up to the room to retrieve said items. He was very friendly and indeed acted as the information desk for a number of people. If only they could clone him! The casino was great with very attentive staff who are at the ready to help with directions, etc. We highly recommend the Grand Lux Cafe. The food was very good with an extensive menu. The wait staff were outstanding! We ate there four different times and had excellent food and service each time. I would not recommend staying at The Palazzo at this point in time.

The chairs and couch had food crumbs all over them. The room has been in use, yet nobody ever cleaned up things like plaster spatters and dust. Fixtures The worst problem was constantly getting locked out of our room. They kept telling us to be careful with card keys. I was trying to get in to the room at close to midnight and needed security to let me in. Midnight is shift change and nobody showed up, and the people at the frontdesk changed so I had to go through everything all over again with them. After my 6th trip to the front desk in one day, they finally figured out that the door lock was broken. Other people had similar complaints, so the locks breaking isn't an isolated incident. One of the sink faucets sprayed more water horizontally than down into the sink. One of the closet doors was off its hinges and wouldn't close. The couch already had tears and missing trim. Service Our room wasn't made up twice, probably because of the problems with the door lock, yet they didn't report it. We asked for clean towels on evening #1 after the room wasn't cleaned. They didn't show up until I went to the front desk to complain. It took some time to get the door lock fixed. When they said they would on the second day, they came at 1:30AM when we were going to bed. The breakfast restaurant can get backed up, and has lots of new staff who forget to take orders, what order people come in, and generally stretch breakfast into a long drawn out meal.

She asked if we wanted to be away or close to the elevators. We got exactly what we requested. She explained the mini bar, it is weighted so even you picked something up to look at it you will be charged. We stayed away from the mini bar. My aunt needed a refrigerator for her insulin. The young lady that checked us in said she would have one sent up, it would take about 10 to 15 mins. The refrigerator came up in the exact time she stated. The room itself was beautifully decorated in soothing tones of brown. We had a bella suite which had two queen beds as well as a pull out couch. Three plasma televisions. The only complaints we had was that the room was dusty. The marble separating the sunken living room and the beds was dusty, the end table in the living room was dusty, and the headboards were dusty. There were no bathrobes in the bathroom. There were slippers in the closet, but no bathrobes. It was not a big deal, I just wanted my mother to have the full experience. The next day when the room was cleaned the maids left plenty of towels since there was three of us registered in the room. The maid however did not leave any wash cloths. It took two calls to get the wash cloths. The maid came to the room the first time and had only towels. She asked that we call downstairs. When we asked if she could call, she insisted that we call ourselves so we did. This time they got it right. They also brought even more towels and the bathrobes .

The room was quite a long walk from the elevator - and I wasn't at the end. The poor folks with rooms even further! The suite was nice. I had a room away from the Strip - facing the mountains - due East. It was a lovely escape from the rest of the craziness that is Las Vegas. I struggled to find the hair dryer - finally found it in a drawer in the bathroom. No coffee pot. The room service prices were outrageous. I signed a note during check-in that said I understood that the items in the mini-bar were weighted...so if I took something out, even if I didn't use it, I would be charged for it. Which, looking at the price list, would have meant $13 for a soft drink and candy bar. I kept my hands out of the mini-bar, needless to say. The roman shades and curtains were cool to open with the remote control. There were three flat-screen TVs in the room (one was in the bathroom...but the tub was backwards so you couldn't lie in the tub and watch the TV...odd). The motion detector in the middle of the ceiling of the suite was odd. Never could figure that one out. It was quiet in the rooms. Never heard any neighbors.

Checkout was fine. It was surprising there were so many people in the casino at 5:00 in the morning, though! If you're going to Vegas and want a really nice room with easy access to the Strip, I guess it's an okay hotel. Just don't expect to get off cheap.

There is also a long tub...not quite enough room for two, but comfortable for one tall person. I would've liked a larger 2-person shower instead of having the tub.

It was a real hassle from the get go. Another problem was not enough wash cloths. For two nights we had to call the front desk for wash cloths because they ran out.

The strip view was beautiful at all times of the day or night. We loved the underground parking as it allows you to walk right into the casino and only a short walk to the room elevators. We parked on the P2 level and were never more than 30 feet from the escalator entrance. This was a blessing for my mother as she is not able to walk very far and is still too proud for a scooter. I would have no trouble recommending this hotel to others as it exceeded our hopes in almost every way.

Ours were too high and we could only see the roofs of different buildings and construction sites.

Parking was a breeze and the Front Desk was a short elevator ride and walk from rthe garage. An employee was stationed in the lobby to intercept incoming guests and steer them to the next available clerk. A breeze again! Front Desk Clerk was very friendly and competent. Lobby is beautiful but subdued in comparison to The Venetian which is not a bad thing just different. Elevator banks are all in the same general area and a guard is stationed there to check for keys and to keep the hallways safe. We reached our room on the 18t floor to discover difficulty opening the door with the electronic key. After four or five times we were successful. This problem plagued us for our four night stay. Room was decorated in European Contemporay, not one of my favorites but very nice none the less. Room was spotless! Bed was extremely comfortable, air conditioning worked great , motorized window coverings were a very nice touch of luxury especially in the morning when just waking. Flat screen Plasma TVs were perfect as was the smaller one in the bathroom which I had forgotten was in there until I saw the room - nice surprise! Only drawback was that someone using the bathtub would not be able to see the TV. Bathroom was perfectly appointed and luxurious. Movies were easy to order and can be operated much like a regular DVD also a nice touch. 30 or more cable channels, too! Some reviewers complained of noise but I only heard a door slam shut twice. In fact I commented to my partner how quiet the room was! Room safe was easy to operate and larger than usual. Mini-Bar is to be avoided unless you want to spend a fortune. One reviewer complained that if you move any of the items in the bar you will be charged, well - DUH! Of course, you will, it's pressure sensitive. Read the price list first. For the business traveler, the office was well appointed although I did not try the WiFi so can not review. Now, for the few thngs that need some ironing out.. We ordered a fridge for medicine as we were checking in. It did not arrive. We called down to see if they knew why the delay and they did not have the order for one. It seems the Front Desk fields all calls for various depts which ends up with miscommunications between the various departments. This same problem showed up regarding the lock problem. A bit frustrating. Housekeepers each have a large # of rooms to clean and ours was cleaned later in the afternoon. Also frustrating if you want to nap before dinner. On the other hand, the housekeepers and all staff are friendly and try to do all they can for you. The only other thing worth noting is their ventilation system...we were constantly smelling grilled steak when we entered the room (!). Not an unpleasant steak smell but a bit inappropriate for our room. LOL . You quickly adjusted to the smell and do not notice it, though, until you leave and come back. Video check out was not working but this gave us the opportunity to voice our concerns with the various problems to the Front Desk in person.

I am glad that we did not. Hotel concierge arranged for a car to pick us up at the airport, and the moment I turned on my phone on the airplane he was calling to let us know where to meet. Check in was a breeze and our room was conveniently located to friends of ours who checked in four hours earlier. The room is the reason you stay here. The sunken living room and spacious suite is like a new, crisper version of the Venetian suites. Three TV's and very comfortable furnishings. King size bed was great. And in very Vegas fashion, you can blackout every ray of light and sleep whenever as if it were midnight. The casino was wide open and spacious. Not the place to go for young singles looking to meet and no bachelor parties or the like. It was less smoke-filled and less crowded than the Venetian which was easily accessed. I enjoyed having our home base be a more mellow version of the Venetian. Dos Caminos, the Mexican restaurant from NYC is located in the casino at the base of the guest elevators, and, although expensive, is fantastic for Margaritas, 140 tequilas, and food. The signature guacamole is as good as you hope. Access to the restaurants and shows at the Venetian and Wynn was very easy. The coffee bar, Espressamente Illy, was easy to access, quick with service, and fantastic espresso. I would recommend breakfast at Bouchon, which is on the tenth floor lobby of the Venezia tower of the Venetian and accessible with your Palazzo key card. My wife loved the spa at the Venetian, which you can access via corridor in Palazzo or through the Venetian. Pool and spa at the Palazzo are not complete, but construction never annoyed us on floor 27. No sportsbook yet, atlhough they have a sportsbook counter outside of Jay Z's 40/40 club. Venetian sportsbook is good, not great. Worth watching a game or taking a tour during the day in Jay Z's bar. I did not go back during \"clubbing\" hours. Check out was a breeze, as well, and they held our bags at departure valet until we left for the airport. When we claimed the bags, they asked about our flight and let us bypass the line for a cab by pulling one off of the cab line. Seems like whatever kinks they had are being worked out.

Our bags were taken from the taxi and tagged to be sent up to our room and we were escorted to the vast check - in area which was quiet. Robert who checked us in gave us a wonderful room on the 36th floor ( more later) before leaving he gave us so much information about the Palazzo and the Venetian and offered to make dinner reservations if required. We had to walk through the casino to get to the guest lifts both of us thought \"wow\" can't wait to get back down. Upon entering the room on the 36th floor the first thing to greet us was the view over the top of TI and the mountains in the distance, we both thought the suite was so well laid out with ample space more than a \"home from home\" ( 3 flat screen tvs added to the experience). bed so so comfortable and loads of room. We slept with the blind and curtains open was so nice to drift off to sleep with the Vegas lights and wake as daylight lit up the city. Pat from guest services arrived soon afterwards with our bags, he also gave us a brief rundown on where to go outside of the hotel, bars resturants etc. We ventured down to the casino and just after we positioned ourselves at the slots we were Approached by a cocktail waiteress to take our drinks order, this was the same throughout our stay whatever machine or table we were playing and both enjoyed a couple of bloody marys each morning before heading out to breakfast !!! We ate in the mexican resturant between both hotels on the 1st evening wonderful meal with wine and tequilas about $80, also had breakfast in the GrandLux ( Palazzo Casino)one morning on way home from an all nighter out at Freemount Street.

There was a spill of some sort on the granite separating the bedroom and the living area. There was a white stain on the chair beside the bed- we have no clue if it is what we thought it might be, but we were not going to touch it. The toilet had a small leak from the intake pipe. There was usually a small puddle in the water closet. The flower vase by the bathroom sink was half full of water with no flower (I really did not care about this, but it seemed odd to have water in a flower vase and no flowers). The light switch in the water closet had no cover to it- just the switch with it's metal components hanging out. The windows were very smudged with fingerprints and face prints.

I walked in to a long room, with a bathroom off the entry way, followed by the bedroom area, followed by a short step-down to a 'living area.'... the bathroom was perfect, classy and clean with separate toilet and bathing areas.. the bed was comfortable... the living space was the best, a long L-shaped couch and a view of the strip below... of course views very, but i think its worth it to ask and/or tip the front desk clerk for a strip view because you have the lights at night, and the mountains by day... we were on the 43rd floor and the view was amazing. This hotel has all the potential to become 'excellent' on these ratings after the early growing pains are worked out... While the staff was courteous and hardworking, there were some slip ups and slow downs... mostly with room service (breakfast never showed up one morning) and taxi's/car service... either they need more staff or just need to get the respective systems up and running more efficiently... if you're traveling there in the near future, be prepared for longer than usual waits to call the concierge or inroom dining, but revel in the largest standard rooms (suites) on the strip to get over your anger... I've stayed at the Bellagio, THE Hotel, MGM, and the suites in Luxor, and I'd put Palazzo at the top of the list for accomodations... the size is great, the location is good, and the quality is top notch... Bellagio has a bit better location and it has the fountains outside and the Bellagio-aura...

Summary - beautiful hotel, will be great when their service issues are resolved. Sister hotel to the Venetian. I felt like the Palazzo was a nicer version of the Venetian - a bit more upscale, with more attention to design detail. Unusual moment - finding used condoms and a bed obviously used recently for sex upon check-in. Beautiful rooms. The design is great - the living area is sunken two steps down from the bed and bath area. This really makes it feel like separate rooms. Beautifully done - surprisingly tasteful. The casino areas are possibly the nicest in town. Very light and open, beautifully done. Really terrific designs. The only problem was service. I know this is a new hotel. But their website doesn't indicate that some amenity areas aren't done yet. Specifically, the elaborate pool / jacuzzi / wading areas aren't done. True, not an issue in colder weather, but it would have been nice to know that before booking. You can I guess use the facilities at the Venetian, but that's quite a trek. There is only one functioning Palazzo pool, and you must pay $35 to get a spa pass to use that pool. When the pool area is done it will be spectacular. It's on a rooftop a few floors up, and it's going to be astoundingly nice. And many of the shops advertised aren't open yet. Not a huge deal, but it would have been nice if they'd say this on the website. Their WIFI / high speed internet service was dreadful. Paid $10 a day to use, and it was very unreliable. I called to ask for someone to look at it, but was put on hold for about 15 minutes before I gave up. And forget about using their fax / printer (which looks quite nice). Since you can't get a decent internet signal you can't download the variety of drivers and software needed to use the printer / fax. But biggest problem? We reserved a king size bed with a view (the view is an upcharge). When we got there they told us they only had one that was smoking but they assured us it would not smell like smoke. Turns out it did. But even worse was that there were used condoms in the trash can and the bed had obviously recently been used for sex, and hadn't been cleaned afterward. Oddly, parts of the room had been cleaned. I think maybe hotel staff had used the room for a little sexual liason after it had been cleaned maybe the day before. We called the front desk, and they gave us a bit of attitude, as if somehow it was our fault and/or that they didn't believe us. They did swap us out for a room with two queen beds, with a view. So in short we never got exactly the room we had reserved. This was mid-week and the hotel didn't appear that busy, so I highly suspect they make only a certain number of each type room available if you book through Travelocity or such. After our little condom adventure I would have thought they would be willing to be a bit flexible on this, but apparently not. Tip: definitely get the view upgrade - well worth it to be able to see the sunsets over the mountains. Tip: All the restaurants but one in this hotel are expensive fine dining, with an odd overabundance of steak and seafood joints (Morel, in the main lobby, appears to be the best of the bunch, and a bit less pricey). The Grand Lux is more moderately priced, and we had several good meals there. I believe it's owned by the Cheesecake Factory folks (yes, I know, a bit suspect, but it was actually very good and has a very extensive menu). The shrimp scampi was great, with huge shrimp. The spicy bloody mary was very good also. There is another Grand Lux in the Venetian next door. The new one in the Palazzo looks neater, with some really great design details. Very good restaurant service.

Had a stuffed lobster dish that was out of this world. One of our entrees was later in coming and the manager came over and comped it! Nice. Saw \"O\", this time from a higher view (last time was in the front wet row), different perspective, still a good show, awesome stage. Bellagio's buffet was still way better than Paris'. Tried Cathay House, chinese restaurant recommended by others on this site, was ok, would try the another in chinatown next time.", "Date": "February 20, 2008"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "The Palazzo Resort Hotel Casino", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g45963-d675000-Reviews-The_Palazzo_Resort_Hotel_Casino-Las_Vegas_Nevada.html", "Price": "$167 - $416*", "Address": "<address class=\"addressReset\"> <span rel=\"v:address\"> <span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">3255 Las Vegas Blvd South</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:locality\">Las Vegas</span>, <span property=\"v:region\">NV</span> <span property=\"v:postal-code\">89109</span></span> </span> </span> </address>", "HotelID": "675000", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/ProviderThumbnails/dirs/7d/48/7d486295aa9b1c4e74709ff7541b6f4f4large.jpg"}}
