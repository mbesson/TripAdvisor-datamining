This was the first time in the HI Express Canal de la Villette and was pleasantly surprised. Location: Along the canal, which was nice and I think especially in summer it must be fun to go for a stroll. Riquet Metro Station a few minutes away; 10 mins from central Paris, few stops from Gare de l'Est. Cinema a few steps away and quite a few nice restaurants around. Rooms: I had an upgrade as platinum member to the 6th floor with balcony and view on the canal. The room was clean, big enough, flat screen tv and beds comfy. Spacious shower which had lots of pressure. Desk with Internet Cable & Sofa Bed. No wardrobe cupboards, but hangers and open cupboard to put your clothes. (as in many HIE hotels) Breakfast: Is included and buffet style. Croissants, Baguettes, cereal, scrambles eggs & sausages, ham, chicken, cheese.... etc. It's ok, no change in the 4 nights I stayed though. Internet: As almost everywhere in France... is paid. Wired from the rooms and wireless from the lobby (however my room 607 reached the wifi). Think wifi was 3 hours for 5\u20ac and wired about 15\u20ac a day Parking: YES! for 15 euro p.n. safely under the hotel. I just parked my car and used the metro to get around city centre the 4 days I was there. I will come back and this place is perfect for business as well to go with family & kids. Moreover it is good value for money; booked via the hotel website for 108 Euro a night. Try to find that in Paris (for the same quality in a nice area) .... A word of caution when travelling in the metro: Keep your wallet safe especially around Chatelet station. Thieves are so crafty you wont notice and in a split second thieves manage to get your wallet. Yes this happened to me... even I am used to travel taking the metro a lot.... Luckily someone saw my wallet on the floor and I got it back. The thieves were able to (only) take out the euro bills, left the pounds and thank god I still had my cards and driver license....

I haven't stayed in any other hotels in Paris but I suspect this is a very large room comparatively. (I've stayed in rooms less than half this size in New York City.) Bed was comfortable. The bed size is referred to by the hotel as a \"double\" but it is about the size of an American California King. Shower was great - hot and strong. Breakfast was excellent. Coffee, both American-brewed and a machine that automatically makes cappuccino. Buffet also offered breads/croissants, sliced cheese and ham, cereals including some kind of granola and what appeared to be Count Chocula, and eggs and sausages. Location was not central but I appreciated it. There are many non-touristy restaurants in the neighborhood. A few minor drawbacks that prevented a 5 rating: the lighting in the room was insufficient and it is slighly dark in the evening. This may be due to the \"eco\" slant of the hotel, I'm not sure. There was not enough storage space for me to empty my suitcase for a 4-night stay. I paid with Priority Club points plus cash, $60 cash + 5000 points per night.

Came to Paris on Eurostar and only took about 10 minutes on the Metro (to Riquet with 1 change at Stalingrad) from Gare du Nord Fantastic service from reception staff who gave us some local restaurant advice for lunch and evening which we took (A lunch at La Bastringue (on the way to the Riquet metro) and an evening meal at Draco which was fantastic. Hotel itself was in great condition and it was so quiet and peaceful. We were lucky to get a canal view room which was brilliant - you can see the groups of men playing boules on the canalside and rowing on the weekends. We'd read reviews about breakfast being a bit chaotic but we didn't experience that. Yes the tables were quite close together and I could imagine if it was full it could get very busy but you are warned in the information about potential waiting times (we didn't have to wait). There were hot sausages and scrambled eggs then a cold meat and cheese selection as well as cereals, breads, croissants and pain au chocolats. The single toaster was the only hiccup as queues were building for that. But didn't bother us - we just had extra croissants! We loved the area as it wasn't touristy at all (and hence a bit cheaper!) but it was still quick to get into central Paris if you're able to get the Metro.The local area is being redeveloped and I think lots of new places will be popping up all over the place. One of the best things we did was go to the Hammam du Canal which was behind the hotel. Spent 3 hours being steamed, exfoliated, wrapped in mud, saunaed, resting with Moroccan tea/pastries and then a massage. It's a new hammam and has mixed days on Saturday but if you're escaping to Paris for a rest as leaving children behind like us then this is a definite must!

There's a fantastic, old-fashioned drawbridge right behind the hotel. The staff was very friendly, patient with my attempts to speak French, and always helpful when I had questions. The rooms are simply furnished and decorated, but the real attraction is being able to look and walk outside. I recommend the Crimee metro station rather than Riquet at night. Caution: if you are alone, it can be a bit intimidating in the area at night. Make the effort to figure out the metro and bus systems: Bus route 54 stops along Rue de Flandres (where you get the metro) and goes right by Gard du Nord, and then up to Pigalle, Blanche & Clichy, the Moulin Rouge/Sacre Coure neighborhoods! If you buy a \"carnet\" of 10 bus tickets at Gare du Nord, you can use each for one-way with transfers. Or, buy a \"mobilis\" good for unlimited rides for one day.

Very clean, very organized, and very economical; i.e., the room space is efficiently used and extraneous things such as closets and dressers are cut out and replaced with a tiny clothes rack with (rather annoying to use) hangers. The front desk and concierge are good people--very patient with requests: I desperately wanted to try a Michelin restaurant so the front desk graciously made a ton of calls for me. The breakfast was pretty shoddy, not gonna lie. The chef seemed to get lazier and lazier each day as there were progressively fewer choices the longer we stayed. E.g. there was yogurt, cream cheese, granola, scrambled eggs and sausage the first day, and all that whittled down to just 2-3 of those by the end. And since I love fresh fruit, it killed me that all they had was the canned stuff drowned in nasty syrup. If you're looking for somewhere quiet and safe, this is a good hotel.

The area is what you'd expect of the outskirts of a major city - a bit shabby and rough as you walk from the metro, but certainly nothing to worry about. The hotel itself is in a quite gentrified part of the district - lovely to walk along the canal in the evening. The OKAY cafe over the bridge is friendly and good value. Arriving from Charles de Gaulle take the RER to Gard du Nord then take the Metro. We followed advice from other reviewers and headed for Riquet station on line 7, which means a change a Gare de l'Est. But to avoid having to change lines, its quicker (and easier with suitcases!) to take Line 5 instead to Laumiere station - its only 2 stops and no changes, and brings you out on the other side of the canal. From Laumiere metro station it's 10 mins walk to the hotel - exit onto Av de Jean Jaures and turn left. At the traffic lights turn left (there's a sign to Canal de la Villete) and walk past the shops/supermarket and over the bridge - hotel is on your left. The hotel is a good base for travelling into Paris - its worth buying a 'carnet' of 10 single metro tickets for 12.90 from a ticket machine in any station, instead of paying 5 euros each if buying individually. Use Riquet metro station for travelling into Paris from the hotel. If you are seeking 5* luxury, then this isn't the hotel, or the district for you.

Spent ages on various websites looking for reasonably priced hotels that were comfortable with good access to the city centre. Problem with Paris (and London) is that you take a bit of a risk with cheaper hotels: they tend to be of indeterminate quality. Anyway, this Holiday Inn Express is situated 3 mins from Metro (line 7) which runs to many of the main sites (Louve, close to Notre Dame etc). Takes about 15-20 minutes to get to say, the Louvre from the Hotel on the Metro. The area where the hotel is located is not particularly touristy (good in my opinion) and is situated near a canal which was quite pleasant to walk along - lots of cafes near the upper end. Overall, the hotel itself was good: pleasant staff, clean, comfortable if small rooms. Pity internet wasn't included in the price, but I think that HI have a policy of charging for it. There is a bar below the hotel (Belushi's) which is quite good fun, and they serve pretty decent burgers. A couple of other little cafes (one opposite the main entrance to the hotel) looked pretty good (lots of locals) though we didn't try them. I wouldn't visit Paris in August again though. The crowds / queues for the main attractions (Louvre, Notre Dame, Eiffel Tower) were unbelievable. The day we tried to visit the Louvre there was a sign up saying estimated queue time to be around an hour. We went back the next day and entered via the Carrousel (near the Metro exit) and didn't have to queue at all - everyone else was queuing upstairs near the Pyramid!

The hotel in itself was very clean, they gave us the family room with the canal view. There was no tub in the bathroom, just a shower but that was really all we needed.

Best part of this hotel: larger rooms and larger showers than you'd normally expect in Paris; *fabulously* quiet evening -- not a single noise, large firm beds, and shower and bathroom so sparkling clean that you would have thought they'd just been installed yesterday! Have stayed at far pricer places all over Europe that were nowhere near this clean. Shower is also double-size so plenty of space to scrub-a-dub-dub without bumping elbows or getting water on the floor. Room is large enough for a small sofabed and plenty of room to walk around. Telly has millions of FR channels, BBC World, CNN, Arte, Bloomberg, but nothing else international that might be entertaining. Breakfast buffet was acceptable -- cereals, yogurts, bread, etc -- not much choice of juices or breads/pastries, and the cheeses looked a bit old -- but it was all edible and there was *no wait* even when hotel was full, which is quite something.

I had to catch a flight to Prague but I wanted to see the city at the same time. I am an upper scale traveler but like a deal when I see it. Paris hotels are outrageous so I choose this newer hotel on the outskirts of the city. Location- The location is on a serene river. It is a local area. There is almost no tourism in this section of the city. There is a long park out front. There are plenty of locals playing games in the park. There is also a bar right down the street that is very popular. Distance from the center of city is decent. It is not annoyingly far but it is not close. It took about 20 mins to get to the Louvre by train. From the Eiffel tower, it took about 30-45. Paris is so big that this sort of time is expected where ever you go. It is not really bad but just expected. Rating: B Room- The best word to describe it is small. I am in college and this is smaller than my dorm room. So make sure you are staying with someone you know. It is not dreadful but just small. The space between the beds is less than half an arm lengths away. The room was very clean. Although it was small, it was very well designed. They used the space very well. There are not many amenities. It is basic. The bathroom was clean and simple. The bathroom door functions as a door with the toilet as well. A word of warning: the room does not come with real soap and shampoo. It is from a dispenser and is not very good. There is no bar soap which seemed strange. There really is very limited amount of \u201cdesign\u201d elements within the room. The only thing that came close to that is a small blue light in the bathroom. The shower interface is rather strange and not very well designed. It took me about 20 minutes to figure it out. I eventually got it to work but I still did not know if I was still doing it right. The bed is very nice. It is small as well but very comfortable. The rooms were quiet and the hotel is steel designed so it is hard to hear anyone but those in your room. Rating:B- Hotel- The lobby was very nice. It was not very big but well designed. There was a lot of color and was very clean. The service was efficient and effective. They were courteous and very good at their job. The breakfast provided was simple but filling. I can only see eating there two times. More than that, and it would get tiresome. There were a lot of people down there. It seemed like there were a lot of people there but it was still a quiet place to stay. Rating:B Overall, this would be a good three star. I do not think they want to try harder than that. It would be very easy for them to move up to a three and half. Here are some possible improvements because I do not want to just off critiques. \u2022 Thicker Towels \u2022 Real amenities \u2022 Free internet (why does everyone in Paris charge a arm and a leg for such a basic service) \u2022 A little more decoration and features in the room If they did these above things, this could be a very nice three star or a bottom basic four star. Good stay. I probably would not stay again as I like to Hotel hop. There are hundreds of great hotels in Paris. I would put this one as a great place to stay for a getaway from the Center of Paris. It is closer to the airport than central Paris. Stay here if you want a good value, free breakfast, newer rooms, and in between the airport and Paris.

Holiday Inn Express in my opinion are a well trusted brand name, and commonly stand for value for money, good comfort (but no frills) and centrally placed for your destination. I understood that Paris-Canal de la Villette wasn't necessarily going to be bang in the centre of Paris and expected a tube/taxi ride into the city. I primarily chose this one as it was the nearest to the Gare du Nord (only 2 stops on the underground / 2km) and it was in the 'quiet' suburbs of the city of Paris. So therefore a trek into the main sights is at least a 5km away. When we first arrived (Riquet underground being the nearest to the hotel, only a 3 minute walk) I was pleasantly surprised by the tranquillity if the setting. The hotel was indeed individual in appearance and sported some pretty unusual balconies (only for show cannot be used). From a glance looked like some woven bamboo wicker rails which were in fact metal on closer inspection. To one side of the hotel was a seafood restaurant (not owned by HI Express) and to the other a cafe bar called Belushis. Holiday inn express only had a small bar but no evening food was served. Everything looked very peaceful (granted it was Sunday afternoon when we arrived); there was a young boy fishing and older gentlemen playing boules in the area outside. After checking in (fault free & friendly welcome) we made our way to the room. The whole the hotel had this very new and futuristic feel to it. But also that eco feel. It was surrounded not only by the canal but also as you entered the glass lift and ascended you were taken through was like a giant vivarium or greenhouse which housed real plants and felt quite Amazonian! Upon reaching the floor you were hit with a wall of heat! Not sure how eco friendly the hotel was (whether it was heated by solar energy or not) but the corridors were certainly very overbearingly hot! I think every radiator was on. We are having a very cool May but this was ridiculous! Once inside our room all the air con was quickly put on and window opened. It wasn\u2019t that warm outside, but the heat from the rooms was nearly as unbearable as the corridors. Once comfortable we made tracks and went out to explore. Only a short walk away (20 -30 minutes along the canal banks) was the nearest attraction, cite des sciences /the science museum (which unlike the UK version isn't free admission). To be honest we probably wouldn't of visited this attraction had we not of being staying out of town. Although it is top on the list of 'must do things' in Paris on the whole so we were quite lucky in that respect. It\u2019s a great place for entertaining the kids and its very interactive much the same as the UK one, and is very futuristic and modern and is built in the grounds of the parc de la villette, a pretty little park that runs alongside the canal. Back to the hotel, I was disappointed not to find many restaurants in the immediate location. In the evening after visiting the science museum we had to really look hard to find anything decent. It was Sunday evening so hard enough as most French shops are closed, they do not have Sunday opening so even the supermarket was closed. We decided in the end to take the easiest option of the seafood restaurant adjacent to the hotel entrance. Here the food was well priced and staff were friendly. If you order fish and chips though, do be warned its not traditional fried fish in batter!! And if you are English maybe ask for the English menu rather than struggling through the French one! There wasnt a lot to do afterwards except go back to the room as the area is rather inactive. All the other decent restaurants were unfortunately out of the district so stayed out late after our sightseeing to eat in the more central restaurants rather than venturing back. The neighbourhood on the Quai de la Seine is a little quiet at times and you may feel rather unsure of venturing out after dark. There are a few down and outs sleeping in doorways too and the smell of urine is quite apparent. The metro thankfully was so easy to use (trains are cheap and frequent) that all the major sights and restaurants were not so hard to get to. Although could of done without a 8-10 stop ride on the tube. One night there was a rowdy party in one of the external student bars on the streets and this did mean that everything could be heard in the dead of night purely because the traffic noise was so minimal and not a lot else was happening. As the rooms are so warm we had to have the large window open (only opens 10cm for safety though). This is an excellent hotel in terms of how clean and modern it is and the beds are the best I've slept in they were the most comfortable hotel beds around. The bathrooms were clean and trendy. No bath, just an extra large shower which was wonderfully hot and powerful. Fresh clean white towels everyday. The rooms are a little pokey but had enough room to get around in without harm. The flatswidescreen TV did have a few rather expensive Pay per view channels (films being a whopping 12 euros!!) So was stuck with BBC world service for the duration! Had a point for high speed internet though if you brought a laptop with you. The value I found was a little poor however, one because of the location and two because of the facilities. The breakfast was 'free' / complimentary and so it should be at 135 euros a night! and you can eat as much as you like which was great. But if the rooms had been cheaper I could have done without the breakfast. It was basically, continental, a few cold meats, baguettes, croissants, toast, yoghurt and juice/tea/coffee. The scrambled eggs was watery and tasteless and the mini sausages were well erm not sausage maybe??! Best eaten burnt with lots of ketchup on (as they were one morning). But this was the only hot choice of food. I would recommend this hotel to somebody who likes the quiet pace of life, and doesn't mind mingling with the locals, there were not many foreign tourists in the district being one of the only hotels in the area and you did feel like part of the broader community of Paris. Next time we visit Paris will chose a more centrally located hotel, but will probably miss the peacefulness at night, ah well I guess you cannot have it all!", "Date": "May 5, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "UK", "Title": "\u201cGreat Hotel within good distance from the centre\u201d", "Author": "uk1raver", "ReviewID": "UR59937766", "Content": "My wife and I stayed at this hotel for a weekend for our anniversary.

It is interesting for a stroll and probably especially fun for children; frequently concerts and festivals take place there.

There's a very nice patisserie run by a Jewish family on rue de Crimee about two blocks from the hotel.

The last morning at around 8 30 am, a cleaning lady forced herself into our room `thihking we\u00b4d vacated it`, and when we were checking out, a receptionist called Jenny gave me an evil eye, and never wished us a good trip, nice day or anything hotel stuff usually do. 130 euros per night, plus 15 euros for a car is more than double of what we would pay for a night in that place. We left for Ibis in Luxemburg and had a warm welcome and great time there.", "Date": "July 17, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "2", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "New York", "Title": "\u201cGreat Hotel - Easy access to Metro\u201d", "Author": "smarcy", "ReviewID": "UR34041297", "Content": "We stayed at this hotel for 5 nights on a tour of Paris.

We stayed three nights (couple and 6 year old daughter) and loved it. Its location is fantastic, overlooking the canal, and a very short walk to Riquet or Crimee metro stations. The area is a \"real\" neighborhood, unlike St. Germain, Monmartre and other tourist oriented areas. We felt perfectly safe throughout our stay, and it included late night walks. Our room on the 5th floor was large enough to sleep three persons and it was really smart. Smart is the word for the entire hotel, as everything seems to be in place for a reason. It is also in walking distance from Parc de la Villettee, a really fun place for kids and adults alike. Our daughter enjoyed the City of Sciences and loved the 3D dinosaur movie at the Geode. There is also a great seafood restaurant on the ground floor (not operated by Holiday Inn) called La Cri\u00e9e which is part of a French seafood restaurant chain. Food was great and the price just right!

Nice quite location, away from main roads. The hotel is modern, clean and has terrific staff. Paris was very warm and humid when I visited.

The room has a large Queen Size bed and a bed settee, and it is large enough for a family. The Bathroom was clean with a shower, and a clever use of doors allows someone to use the toilet in private, whilst someone showers in private. The Hotel room also had a large LCD TV with plenty of cable channels, some of which were in English. Breakfast was good. A huge choice with an all you can eat buffet including hot meats, eggs etc. The Coffee was very nice. I traveled to Paris without a car, and the hotel is 2-3 minute walk to Riquet metro station where you can travel directly to Gare Del'Est, Opera and the Lourve. If you are traveling by car, the hotel has plenty of parking. The hotel does not provide an option to have an evening meal. However, there is a nice looking restaurant next door, and plenty of Cafes near by. Near Riquet Metro Station is a large supermarket to keep you with plenty of water, snacks etc. All in all a nice hotel, with friendly staff who speak fluent English.", "Date": "June 7, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "IOM", "Title": "\u201cClass hotel in premier location\u201d", "Author": "suncool", "ReviewID": "UR30661898", "Content": "My wife and myself spent 5 days in this hotel from 12th May 2009 and found it to be an exceptional hotel in a lovely location just outside Paris.
