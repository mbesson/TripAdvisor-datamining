I would avoid Agoda at all costs. I placed my reservation via the internet, The agoda site was sloppy and I inadvertently booked 2 rooms instead of one room. I also thought the rate per night was the rate for the 2 night stay. So, I booked a charge that was 4X what my expected cost would be. NO WHERE ON THE BOOKING CONFIRMATION DO I VISIBLY SEE THE TERM \"Non-Cancelllable\". When my confirm was sent with 4X the charges expected, I immediately requested the reservation to be cancelled. Agoda confirmed the cancellation, but according to Pat in Agoda customer service, the hotel will not refund my money. I have a copy of the booking and nowhere does it say non-cancellable in the booking summary. Bottom line--It is not just about location, restaurant, and reception. It is also about service, and respect for customers. Do not book this hotel, and do not use Agoda for booking. Agoda provides no service, and you can see from my experience how the Hotel Modern chooses to make money.

It is an older hotel, but has been updated. There are three or four computers that may be used gratis, and they always worked and there was rarely a wait for them. The wi-fi in public areas was also gratis, and dependable. There is a large and comfortable waiting space on the first floor, and also a small area with cushy furniture near the reception. Since we had plenty of time in Barcelona on this visit, we didn't feel the need to go out during a couple of downpours. We spent a few hours in the lounge area on the first floor, catching up on email and reading.The nearby breakfast room is cheerful and the buffet is more than ample. There are two pump coffee machines which produce various varieties of caffinated beverages. The staff is most helpful and friendly. The location on la Rambla, near Plaza Catalu\u00f1a, was perfect for us. I have to agree with an earlier reviewer about the room service. Although in general, the room and its bathroom were relatively clean, we were there for a week and our sheets were never changed, nor were the floors swept, judging from the dust I accumulated on my stockings when I was in the room. Because of the season, we did not need the air-conditioner. The temperature in the room was just fine. We had a window and small walkout balcony over the Carrer Hospital, just off the Rambla, and the noise from revelers drifted all night into the room. Even though the windows had double panes, they were no match for happy partiers outside. This said, I will definitely be staying in this hotel again.

This was unfortunate and made for a terrible night's sleep, but a subsequent discovery turned this place into hotel hell. We'd spotted a couple of beetle-like bugs on the beds the next morning, but as we had no obvious bites (and thought bed bugs were smaller and not so easily visible) we dismissed them as an unpleasant and unwanted, but harmless addition to the room. NOT SO! A week later I discovered bed bug bites all over me. Small bumps had appeared a couple of days after I left Barcelona, but they were not itchy and given the delay, I though I'd simply had soe allergic reaction to something in Madrid, where I was then staying. However, a further 4/5 days later, the bites swelled and became red, irritated and itchy (extremely unpleasant when you've got 100s of them all over your body, including your face). My friend also had bites and this was the only place we'd stayed together - the common link! All in all, I cannot recommend this hotel. The staff were nice enough but not particularly friendly.

We got to our room and the smell was stronger in there. And it was the strongest in the bathroom. The smelly was so foul it was turning our stomachs. We went straight down to reception and asked for a new room, but were told there were none available. We thought maybe if we jst open the windows put the exhaust fans on it might go. It never went, and was so strong it woke us up during the night. We discovered that the smell was coming up from their drains in teh bathroom, so you can't do anythign to stop it. The other thing was that the WiFi does not work in the rooms. it works down in the lobby, but not in the rooms. Apart from these 2 things the hotel is a nice place. They have a good breakfast buffet also. So if you can handle the foulest smell on earth and don't need internet access in your room, then this may be the palce for you. If on the other hand, you prefer to be able to breathe when staying in your hotel room - then don't stay here.", "Date": "September 18, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "1", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "UK", "Title": "\u201cModerno not a fitting name\u201d", "Author": "poor-wandering-one", "ReviewID": "UR41637230", "Content": "This hotel is not in the slightest bit modern- more 70s style, except for the bathroom which was a bit newer.

The night before our departure, we had to knock on the glass door to wake him - hehad fallen asleep at the front desk watching a portable TV. We asked him for an adaptor for our phones- the ladies at Reception had asked us to ask him . He refuse to acknoweldge out requst - I drew th adaptor- he then shoutd and told us - we thought - to go and buy one for ouselvs. By this time he was shouting. Worse was to follow. When we checked out the folloiwng morning - he was still on duty. We dealt with the final extra's on the bill, and asked for the fre srvic to call a taxi.We had used this service th previous night through Susannah - and it worked a treat- cheap and efficient. It was done reluctantly and with bad grace. When th cab arrived- the driver went inside to check in with the front desk. We saw him talking to Juan Marin. We finally understood why - when we wer droppd at the Sixt Car hire office near the railway station, we wer overcharged - dpsite remonstrations - by 17 Euro's. Mr Marin had arranged this ovrcharge - of this we have no doubt. He is a disater for this nic hotel - and is theonly rsult I could not recommend this hotel.

Overall I would suggest the hotel for young travelers (groups, not family) traveling to Barcelona and looking for central location and do not plan to spend a lot of time inside.

Right in the heart of the busy Ramblas area you can explore many of Barcelona\u2019s attractions on foot, as long as you wear a good pair of walking shoes. However the rooms we were allocated were no more than shoeboxes. My friend\u2019s room was more suitable for a hamster, and his morning view was the inner walls of the hotel itself. More akin to a cheap hostel size or a prison .The bathroom floors were so dirty I had to ask the cleaners to mop it again to remove the hairs all over the floor. The breakfast, although continental is far from adoqute.I was offered more choice in a cheaper hostel in Amsterdam recently. If you\u2019re a vegetarian then forget it. Its cornflakes or cheese and bread. Once, there was no milk left for coffee, and another morning my half eaten breakfast was swiftly removed from my table as I stood up to get another drink. But by far the worst aspect of this hotel is the noise. I didn\u2019t get a single good nights sleep whilst there. You hear every footstep and every banging door throughout the night and early next morning. I wish someone on trip advisor had warned readers of this, and I for one would definitely not have stayed. On my last morning they were actually doing work on the next room. The noise was atrocious. And to the end this inaccurately 3starred hotel overcharged for the rooms. I disputed the bill twice pointing out that by email I was assured this was the final amount. This fell on deaf ears and I was advised this is the tax on top. So why tell me otherwise before arrival? All in all, the place is overpriced for what you get, and the service is mediocre at best. The rooms are nothing more than tiny cupboards and the food as bare as it can comes. If you\u2019re stuck, and there is nowhere else to choose, then maybe worth a look. But confirm in writing the total Inc tax before hand, and ask about the view of the room first.
