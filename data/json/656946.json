Some review about stolen guests' properties had discouraged me to book this hotel as the first option for our family vacation. Eventually, we found out that our hotel was far too distant from the main attraction and it has forced us to make an impromptu booking with Eurostars St. John on the day. Our first impression of this hotel was it nice nicely located within walking distance from the colosseum, palatine hill and roman forum. Gary, the receptionist was very helpful from the moment we checked in and throughout our stay. Gary patiently answer our queries in relation to maps, tourist attraction, supermarket, restaurants, bus station or taxi booking. He even give us a complimentary bus tickets for three days - he said he has two tickets which are unused and have let us to use them. We booked two connecting rooms. The room was nice and furnished with modern furniture. Shower was good and very clean and beds were comfortable. We don't have a problem staying with 2 young kids (7 and 4 years old) We always have our luggage locked and store our valuables in the safety vault having read the security review of this hotel. However, we felt that the security of this hotel were well maintained. We notice that a security guard was always on duty during the night at the reception areas. We thought that there was nothing wrong with the security system in this hotel. Breakfasts were good. Good choices of breakfast from fruit to bread to a full continental breakfast. The quality of the food was fine - good enough to provide us with calories before we explore rome. Back to location. Having situated between Labicana and Manzoni Metro Station, this hotel will save you some transportation costs. As I said, colosseum, the palatines and roman forum are within 10-15 minutes easy walk, or, if you are lazy enough you may easily take the Bus number 3, 85 or 87 from the nearby bust stop (3 minutes walk). You may use Manzoni Metro Station (5 minutes walk) to reach Vatican City (25 minutes by Metro). But one thing that we love is the bus number 85 which would easily cover colosseum, the palatines, roman forum, piazza venezia, the central museum, fountain of trevi, spanish steps, pantheon, piazza novena, and piazza colonna. We felt like this bus was our hop on hop off bus. We love the strategic location of this hotel. One thing missing in the room was the kettle and tea/coffee making facilities. We understand that most of the hotel in Italy don't provide kettle anyway - not sure why. There are NO restaurant within the hotel, but restaurants and bars are within walking distance from the hotels. Chinese, Indian and Japanese restaurant for example are within 5 minutes walk from the hotel - we have no problem finding foods. Another plus point of this hotel is that there is a sport centre (with tennis, swimming pool and gym facilities) literally next door - I do mean it is the next building after the hotel. Looks good even tough we didn't have time to use it. One suggestion to the hotel: please could you provide another trash bin within the room. There is only a small bin in the bathroom which we found insufficient. Again, we are happy with this hotel. This is overall a GOOD hotel with a good service and helpful staff.", "Date": "April 17, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Dallas, Texas", "Title": "\u201cGood Experience\u201d", "Author": "NazA03", "ReviewID": "UR126483450", "Content": "A friend of mine and I decided to head to Rome for 4 days.

Full tub with jets, great shower, there was enough room for four people to be getting ready in the bathroom if need be. Breakfast was also very delicious. The hotel was within 10 minutes walking to the Colosseum which was perfect if you did one of those \"hop-on, hop-off\" bus tours to get around to the sites and the city (we used it kind of like a taxi). Great food aalso within walking distance. As two girls traveling alone, felt very safe in not only the hotel but the surrounding area. Would definitely recommend and stay here again. Only downside was that they possibly need more than one person at the front desk and you can hear all street noise from the church/youth center next door in the room (but that you will have no matter where you stay in Rome).", "Date": "March 22, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Los Angeles, California", "Title": "\u201cNicely decorate and helpful staff\u201d", "Author": "metonyc Posted by an Accorhotels.com traveler", "ReviewID": "UR125704532", "Content": "We stayed there for 4 nights.

For one Euro, you can get to the Vatican in less than half an hour and St John's Basilica was five minutes up the hill. The hotel itself was spotless, modern and the staff were friendly and very helpful. They gave complimentary Prosecco to us when they found out it was my birthday and were happy to give us directions and maps wherever we wanted to go. Our room was very clean and was cleaned every day with fresh towels. The only slight down side was that it was very small and the shower was tiny. It did however, have a mini bar and Wi Fi. The TV had a variety of channels. We paid extra for breakfast and it was great value, anything you could wish for was on the menu, fresh fruit, cereal, bacon and eggs, pastries, cake, cheese, ham, salad, toast, teas, coffee and juice.

On the same evening, another couple had a laptop taken from their room, which wouldn\u2019t have fitted into the safe. Looking at Tripadvisor, it seems as if at least two other people have had things stolen from their rooms in July 2010 (one review in English, one in Spanish), that there were similar incidents back in May 2009 and that there have been thefts from bags stored in reception, which leads me to conclude that this hotel has a serious ongoing problem with security. The manager was fairly helpful when we reported the theft, though he didn\u2019t accompany us to the police station, as he had the other couple, assuring us that they spoke English (they didn\u2019t at all, resulting in a very stressful couple of hours at the police station \u2013 not an ideal way to spend our first morning on holiday). He said that if we could get him proof of purchase for the camera and the phone, we would get some money from the hotel\u2019s insurance (I think they are legally obliged to provide this according to art.1783 of Italian Civil Code), but despite providing everything that he asked for promptly we have heard nothing from him since our return to the UK, and emails and many expensive phone calls have gone unanswered. It's very frustrating. The other reception staff were incredibly unsympathetic, rude and unhelpful. The two women who were often on duty claimed not to understand when we said that things had been taken from our room, even though their English seemed pretty good and we weren\u2019t the first - the manager was actually standing in front of her talking to the other couple about their stolen laptop. Never at any point did they show any reaction to what had happened to us, just staring at us stony-faced every time we had to speak to them. The manager said we could use the phone in our room free of charge to make one short call to our insurance company and another to T mobile, and that we could use the internet to access a proof of purchase for my phone emailed to me by T mobile. However this was not communicated to the reception staff, and we had to have quite an argument with the two women about using the internet for two minutes. When you enter the hotel, you turn left for reception and right to get to the rooms, so a thief wouldn\u2019t have to walk past reception, and there is no secure area for bags to be stored. There are safes in the room, but these are quite fiddly to use, and very small. Entry to the room was not forced \u2013 someone had managed to copy the electric key cards / had access to spares. If it hadn\u2019t been for this experience, we would have been pleased with the hotel, as we got it at a good price through the Lastminute Secret Hotels deal. The rooms are fairly small, but comfortable enough, with fresh decoration. There\u2019s some noise in the mornings from the playground that the hotel backs on to. The walls seemed to be quite thin, but our neighbours weren\u2019t up late, so this wasn\u2019t a problem for us. There aren\u2019t many shops or restaurants in the area, but it\u2019s a 15 minute walk to the Colosseum and only a couple of minutes from Manzoni station, on the red line, so it\u2019s fairly quick to get to the Trevi Fountain / Spanish Steps area. Getting to Trastevere, which I think is the best place for dinner, is a bit of a pain as you can\u2019t do it by tube \u2013 it\u2019s walkable, but takes about an hour.

When we walked up he was on a personal phone call, and stayed on that call for 10 minutes while we stood there waiting. He then checked us in, told us it was late (5:00pm) so he was tired which is why he was moving slowly. We go up to our room which was the size of a large walk in closet, however it was very clean. We had two twin beds pushed together, which is the norm for Europe. One window, a TV on the wall (which you could switch the language to English), and the closet and bathroom blended in to the other wall, so for a moment I didn\u2019t think we had any! There were no drawers, so we basically lived out of our suitcases. Bathroom was very clean but extremely tiny, also the norm for Europe. The air conditioner ran well and wake up calls were always delivered on time. However we paid around $350 Euros per night, for a room we could barely walk in. We only ate breakfast once and it was sub-par. Runny eggs, undercooked bacon and over ripe fruit with really awful coffee. As for location, we were about 10-15 minutes away from the Coliseum. We didn\u2019t even attempt to walk to the Vatican and took a cab or this hop on, hop off bus tour. There are numerous restaurants on Merulana Street, which is around the corner from the hotel. My main complaints would be the size of the rooms and the awful service of the concierges. It was as if we were burdening him by asking simple questions, as in recommendations for a restaurant and so forth. Also our travel agent gave him documents to give to us upon check in and he never did. In conclusion, there are tons of other hotels you can stay in while in Rome.

Modern hotel: this seemed to be the only modern hotel I could find in Rome within reasonable price bracket. Most hotels boast about \"authentic 18th century building\" which unfortunately usually means creaky stuff that doesnt work. While I appreciate old buildings from the outside, I dont like tolerating what \"old\" means to sleep in. We once stayed in a \"Hotel Moderna\" in Sienna which was a 200 year old dump. Here, the beds were super comfortable, though the rooms did overheat (in late November!) The lobby / bar area is super classy looking, though they could use the area more, there's a lot of expensive Italian sofas lying around in an empty room downstairs which they could be using as a more lively bar area. We'd like to bring our daughter next time, so I was glad to see a few children in the hotel, though most people seemed to be couples in their 30s/40s. Central: 5 minute walk to metro. Another scary term for Roman hotels is: \"away from the hustle and bustle of Rome\", which seems to translate as \"in Milan\". Reasonable: \u20ac200 for 2 nigths seemed to be a great deal for a 4 star. Only snag: I thought charging for WiFi in a 4 star hotel was a little stingy, you'd never expect to pay for it in most hotels in Dublin. staff were sound, though a little clueless about their city. When we ventured to ask the guy behind the counter if there was anything special on this weekend, he recommended a 20 mile day trip to some site outside of Rome. Knowing we were staying just 2 days in the greatest city in the world, suggesting we leave it to see some ruin seemed ridiculous, but they're very nice people nonetheless. Breakfast: Most reviews of Roman hotels seem to slate the breakfast. I can only conclude that Italians dont really value breakfast as a meal as much as perhaps people in Ireland, England or northern Europe do. To them, breakfast isnt a meal, its just an esspresso with a croissant. In this hotel, breakfast was good, you couldnt complain about it, but not spectacular, maybe at 3 star standard. The one shock for me as a coffee lover was the sight of a coffee machine !!!! from which we were supposed to get coffee, though it transpired that it was decent enough. Nice scrambled egg, average cooked ham, average juice (from concentrate which seems to be the norm - you wouldnt get away with that in a 3 star in Dublin) and then assorted cereals and yoghurt.

We had an issue with our shower flooding the first day, but the hotel fixed it within a few hours. The hotel is incredibly noisy. There are two choices of rooms. One side overlooks a schoolyard. The other overlooks the street. Regardless of what the other reviews say, neither choice is good as far as noise is concerned. We had a room facing the street. Although there isn't much traffic, there is constant slamming of doors and talking into the late hours since the entrance is right below you. If you choose the school side, have fun with the screaming kids at 7 am. Don't plan on getting much sleep at this hotel if you choose it. The worst part about the hotel is the service and staff. I travel frequently and have never encountered such rude staff at a hotel. Not one, but all of them. Quick story....we ran out of toilet paper in our room one night.

Don't expect any service and if you ask for something, expect to feel like you are bothering them. Another thing.....we visited in late April. It was unusually hot during the week we visited (high 80s during the day). The hotel is located in a very old building. While I understand that Italy has some laws about turning on the A/C before summer (not sure if this is true, but this is what the hotel told us), it got incredibly hot inside the building.

The hotel is very clean; the subway is two blocks away and the hotel itself is in a reasonably safe area of the city. Many atractions are walking distance, but at 1 euro a trip or 4 euros a day for unlimited use, you'll probably find the subway useful - there will be plenty of walking even if you do make use of it. There are a few decent restaurants nearby for evenings when you're too tired to be bothered to go far, but no restaurant in the hotel. There are local shops where you can find the odd things you need, and a nearby internet cafe if you don't want to bring your laptop (the lobby is a wireless hotspot apparently, but I didn't try it myself - my vacation included a break from email!) I have a few criticisms. First, the breakfast buffet is okay but not stellar. They do have the worst damn coffee I have ever had the misfortune of getting out of one of those automatic machines. It was netiher cappichino nor plain coffee, but some sort of weak, frothy inbetween thing whose sole virtue was caffeine content. Since the buffet doesn't start until 7am, if you're a morning person each day can be a bit of a coffee crisis. There are nearby coffee places which are quite good. Second, I found the desk staff to be amazingly helpful and friendly. They were endlessly willing to give directions and advice. However, they distribute some written directions on how to get to certain locations using public transportation, and some of their busstop information is not correct. However, all things considered, they do a fabulous job of helping their guests get around the city and with a bit of double-checking that sheet they'll be first-rate in this respect. The rooms are very comfortable, but the climate control can be a bit off. I believe they were running the heating during my visit - the lobby would be comfortable but my third floor room got quite hot at times and I was opening the window to get comfortable. With all the pretty incandescent lighting, it can get really warm - I had to turn off most of the lights as well to avoid a broil situation. It was manageable, but I can see problems in warmer months - request a lower-floor room away from the street is my advice. Some people seem to think this hotel is expensive, but it's really very affordable for Rome in general, especially considering the location. I would stay there again - if you want more creature comforts, expect to pay quite a bit more than their rates. I've stayed in quite a few European hotels and it's always a bit of a shock if most of your travel experience is in the US.

Other reviews had said about the pool not being ready but to be honest there was no time to use the pool what with the great sites to go and see. I would definitely stay at this hotel again.

This went on for over three hours, with no refreshments or any concern from the staff. When we finally got into our room, there was no water or electricity for another few hours. I understand that this was beyond the control of the hotel, but the attitude of the staff was not what you would expect in a supposed 4 * hotel. Further, we had a blanket in our room which had been removed by housekeeping; I asked reception for another one, and they refused, saying that they had none left. On that note, the heating was then turned on hotel-wide, and you are absolutely unable to control this in your room, which turns into a sauna. Asking for someone to have a look at this led to a very rude \"there is nothing we can do; deal with it\" attitude. Having a room on the front of the hotel means that leaving the window open isn't an option as it is too noisy. Oh, and the rooms aren't soundproofed; we could hear every word from the couple next door, and above us, so take some earplugs! On a brighter note, breakfast is good- sets you up for the day, it is close to attractions and the metro, and it is a stylish hotel. However, I wouldn't recommend it if you are looking for a smooth, hassle free, or romantic break.", "Date": "December 28, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "2.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "scotland", "Title": "\u201cdissapointed\u201d", "Author": "captain44", "ReviewID": "UR11295770", "Content": "Just got back from rome, stayed at this so called 4* hotel which may be true in another year when its finished. Rooms were modern and clean as was reception but that was the only good points.Staff seemed to be very unsure of their roles and argued amongst each other often , tiny bar had less stock than my drinks cabinet at home and we always had to search for someone to serve us. Bar /reception area was freezing cold and an outside jacket was required while seated there. No toilets at all except in rooms!!!! so after check out we had no access to toilets at all until we were back at airport many hours later. Breakfast was ok but only hot food were eggs which had a brown crust all over them as a result of lying on hot tray to long.Went for evening meal in hotel ordered fillet steak was given rump and charged for fillet , waitress could speak no english and the whole ordering process was very hard work,all though she did try her best,food eventually arrived and was bland and not at all what you would expect in a 4* hotel, service was generally slow ,often bringing the wrong order. The reception staff were helpfull and spoke english but all other staff didnt seem to have a clue what they were doing,overall over priced with poor resturant, poor service,poor bar, nice room.

There was not good sound insulation, so the noise from adjoining rooms was a bit annoying at times. There was no room service, which would have been nice after spending all day walking around Rome, but there were some restaurants in walking distance (but the less than lovely street put me off especially at night).

The journey from airport to Hotel is a bit shocking and lots of graffitti and even when we arrived in the street of the hotel I thought 'oh dear' as it was a bit grim. BUT then we walked into the hotel and wow we loved it. It was immaculate and the service brilliant. OK yes as some have said the swimming pool saga a shame and for us it was not open, but the rest of the hotel was so nice I didnt care about the pool. The breakfast was lovely and again the cutlery so clean and the service in the dining area faultless. Our room had a spa bath, although small but we had great fun and bearing in mind we had not spend a fortune we thought it was worth every penny. The walk to the Collesseum was about 5 minutes and restaurants were very varied in price etc. Some were very cheap although we didnt like those ones, but even the more expensive we didnt think was a rip off. We spent 4 days constant walking around and caught the sighseeing bus which was great and I have to say we wanted to stay longer... WE LOVED IT!!

Location was great too, 10 mins walk to the colosseum and generally the main sights in the city are walkable from there - though there are metro stations nearby if required. It's also approx. 20 mins walk from Termini station, though a taxi might be best if you have large bags. Having seen many hotels that were either very expensive or cheap but looked like they hadn't been decorated for 30 years, I was very relieved to find this one which was both affordable and well presented.

As you may be delighted to see from the website, the hotel appears to have a swimming pool. 'Hmm, how unusual to have a pool in a hotel in Rome', you think. Yes, that is because it is located in the health club next door where you pay to get in like anyone else. Prime St John does have a handy little timetable on offer for you though! 2. The line ' Located in the heart of the eternal city' could well be changed to 'Located at least twenty-five minutes brisk walk from the edge of the old town'. 3.
