It's basically right near Notre Dame Cathedral and a short walk to the left bank shopping areas. We were able to walk to the Louvre, and there's even a grocery store across the street. As for the hotel itself, it's old but in good shape. It has the old fashioned French look, you'll find a lot of red and gold colors in the building, it's felt a little like a cheesy mardi gras themed room. Breakfast in the morning is average. The front desk workers are very helpful, they'll even make reservations for you. They also suggested excellent restaurants (see my other reviews). I didn't like the fact that the hotel is down what I would call an alley, so try to get back early, it gets a little sketchy in the area late at night. Overall, I would stay here again because the hotel is clean, well run and you don't have to waste time to get out to the area attractions.", "Date": "February 3, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Montreal, Canada", "Title": "\u201cGreat location\u201d", "Author": "cyprincess", "ReviewID": "UR123158185", "Content": "I stayed at this hotel in August of 2011 with my mother and sister and had a wonderful time.

Not Convenient, Horrible staff experiences.\u201d", "Author": "asianPrince-S", "ReviewID": "UR122893553", "Content": "The hotel has lots of issues that I would like to share with other guests. We stayed in Room 507, over New Year's eve against our wish. I strongly suggest avoiding 501, 506, 507 altogether facing the inner light well if you have to stay in this hotel. 1. Inconsistent options, room availability on Tripadvisor search vs. hotel webpage: There are more rooms available and with or without breakfast options in their website, but, when you search through Tripadvisor.com, it will only show the twin room at a different price and no breakfast inc. options. Unfortunately, their hotel homepage was down for reservation at the last page, where you put the payment method. That is when I called and spoke with Olga in early December 2011. Although booked through booking.com for a twin room, at a higher rate, we could get the breakfast included, and she heard me about the bad reviews, and suggested to take the double room on a higher level, instead of the supposedly last twin room. It will have a good view, although located in the back of the main road. She also added that it would avoid the inner well-facing problem. The adjusted booking detail now was changed to the double bed room but, Olga still didn't add breakfast. I had to call around for 2-3 hours more to correct it myself. It was frustrating to talk with the hotel staff on this change. The night guy simply wouldn't help to write down my note for Olga. 2. the hotel in a derelict location, A wrong room given; breakfast very basic with a good service: 2-3 weeks before arrival, during the booking period, I had specifically requested a room that is, not a red-colored, but well-appointed, street-facing room on a higher floor. Instead, we were given a very poorly laid out red-colored room facing a tiny light well, facing the other two guest rooms 3-6 ft away(1-2m), which we can hear them talk, or see every move through the see-through curtains. And, the tiny room was further chopped with a separate toilet, with a separate shower/sink room. And, the lighting well was brightly-lit, mimicking the daylight, at night, and we could not keep the curtain open for ventilation concerned about the privacy and a theft issue. The hotel location itself is also not that great. in Lantier street, there is this old homeless guy throwing bottles to the pedestrian one night, and pissed on himself in public. And also the whole back streets were covered with trash and graffitti, these are signs of derelict and unsafe conditions. The nearby shops on main street(Rue du Rivoli) have only GAP, ETAM, H&M at best, and there is no coffee shop that stays open late or a corner shop that stays open all night in its immediate and visible proximity. The breakfast was of little variety. Croissants and coffee, grapefruit and orange juices were great, but the rest is just the basic ham, boiled eggs, muesli, yogurts, dried fruits, milk. Unless it is included, I would not suggest getting your breakfast here. But it definitely saved our time in the morning. And, if you show up after 9am, you might have to wait for another 15-20 min until the tables open up. These 2-3 kitchen staff are older and the most polite and efficient workers among others. Their smiles were the key elements that saved the breakfast experience not too shabby, in my opinion. 3. The safety box was not working: after reported, still not fixed: Although we heard enough of the notorious Paris Pickpocketting issues, we still had to carry our own passports and all the money with us. We couldn't report this safety box problem the second day as they were busy with other guests, and we would only return after midnight later. 4. staff blaming the manager, other staff, unhelpful and unprofessional: During booking in Mid December, I had to call the hotel for booking issues, mentioned above, a couple of times more, but the night staff(the tall Indian Guy) would not write down a simple memo for Olga, shouting that he doesn't speak English. He did. We further experienced, Olga blamed her hotel manager for not putting the accurate room availability on on-line booking sites when I spoke with her back in early December. I DID NOT HAVE TO HEAR HOW HORRIBLE THEY WERE TO EACH OTHER. 5. NO English TV Channel or its accurate guide available: There was a room guide binder in a drawer, but it didn't show CNN(the only English channel out of 10) at #8 as printed, and there was no English Channel available. So, TV was useless. 6. Poor Room lighting, poor closet space: They put two twin-set halogen landscape Search lights that are sharp to the eyes. The closet space was cramped and was not big enough for two adults with only two carry-on bags. 7. Hot, stuffy room temperature in the morning: Without any heating on, at around 9-10am, the room temperature felt like way above 80'F(25C). We had to get out of the room fast before sweating too much. 8. While Olga blamed others, another staff reacted with aggression: When I got a chance to see Olga, on the third day, which was the second morning, after the previous morning being impossible to approach her as she was busy with others, she instantly blamed the other front desk staff, Nichola, who gave us room 507, and, blamed us, and, I got put off from her over-defensive reactions without a clear and simple apology. In the mean time, this black maintenance staff with braided hair showed up, staring at me, ticking her wrist watch to suggest that I was taking too much time. Olga explained that after 11 am, this woman was to take the front desk shift, which I did not have to know, and still it was very inappropriate to tell me all the details (unprofessional). That was one horrible gesture that I had never experienced in visiting any hotel in the world. With frustration, I simply told Olga to fix the safety box. We left the room key, and I told her we would return at night and she had plenty of time to fix the issue and bring my complaints to the manager. 9. Nothing was done, room wasn't cleaned after reporting the issues! When we returned late that night, the room door has this \"Do Not Disturb\" sign out there, which we didn't put. Surprised, we even had to knock the door to see if the room was given to someone else and we were moved to another room. Then we found out that it was still our room but, nobody attended the room for cleaning, or for fixing the safety box. It was already 1: 30am, and there was only this night staff at the desk who previously yelled at me over the phone and would not help, and we decided to address it early in the next morning to the manager. I was too upset to sleep for half the night, waken up by the noise and coffee smell from the kitchen through this light well, I could not get back to sleep after 5am, getting so angry with the way they had conflicted with us and how our stay seemed to be ruined. 10. More aggression at the front desk, during the last morning; I stood at the lobby, from 7:50am till 8:20, waiting for Raquel, the manager, to show up. While I was talking to Nichola, the same black woman interrupted us and started to show her hostility, pushing Nichola away, as if he was a bullied child. Nichola was attentively listening to my list of experiences and I got upset to see what just happened. When I pointed out to her that the interruption was a very bad manner, she almost started the fight with me. 11. Raquel, the manager, defensively reacted, then apologized: Then, Raquel arrived, and, I insisted we should talk in a quiet area, but she seated us next to the breakfast area, where other guests could hear us. And, I addressed all the issues above. Raquel initially tried to react defensively, explaining that this was only a 3-star hotel and I should not expect 5-star hotel services. She was already missing the point after all. Just like Olga blaming others, Raquel tried to find good excuses. And, I stopped her and clearly mentioned that we should be the last ones complaining about the issues they could easily fix, some of which on a dime. Then, she seemed to listen. And, I clearly told her that I did not have 5-star hotel expectation, already learning that there are known issues from other reviewers on here, but, although I had tried to avoid the negatives from the booking time. it seemed the inconvenience of the room and dealing with poor or aggressive reactions from the staff will never be corrected and any tourist would not tolerate the issues we had. Showing aggression to the guests, Not fixing the safety Box, No English TV channel list, Forgetting Room Cleaning, Blaming the manager and the colleagues... I am trying to think if the experience would be different if we took a better room facing the street. No, I think they are not good for international travelers, yet. All this self-entitled attitude among them and poor upkeep of the room features, not hiring a broad-minded staff would only impale the guest experiences. And, to be honest, these are easy to fix when I think of other hotels we stayed in Paris or in any other parts of Europe. I just want to forget about this bad experience from my memories after posting this review on TA right away.", "Date": "January 10, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Boston, Massachusetts", "Title": "\u201cCharming short-term stay\u201d", "Author": "Susang8184", "ReviewID": "UR122884968", "Content": "I stayed here with my older daughter for two nights in early January before continuing on to a rental apartment on Saint Germain.

At the same time, I can like things that are charming, cosy and down to earth. The Grand Hotel Dechampaigne, located in a building from the 15th century, is all that. It is something about the atmosphere that appeals to me. Also, the location is perfect. You find the hotel in a small and very quiet street, Rue Jean Lantier, very close to the Chatelet tube station and one of the city's main streets; Rue de Rivoli. Chatelet is pretty much in the heart of Paris, in my opinion. The perfect location if you want to live in a central location. The Louvre, Notre Dame, Les Halles and Marais are within walking distance. The Opera district is close. This means that you are in the middle of major cultural sights and Paris' best shopping districts (Marais and Les Halles and Gallery Lafayette and Printemps in the Opera district). The beautiful river Seine is just around the corner from the hotel. Plus for free Internet acess, friendly and helpful staff (most of the time) and a very quiet room. The rooms were rather small, but that is very typical for Paris hotels. When checking out, they let me put my luggage in a room for six hours, so I could enjoy Paris for another day. I didn't try the breakfast, because there was such a nice restaurant and baker shop (boulangerie) just around the corner for the hotel. This time, I travelled alone, on a combined business an leisure trip, and I only had good experiences with the hotel, the area and the people of Paris. The hotel prices were also very good.

It's very close (I'm talking just a few minutes walk) to the Metro, a fabulous neighborhood bakery and restaurants that were rated among the top 100 in the city. We ended up eating at two of these places over the 4 nights we were there and they were wonderful. I'm American but live in Europe. The rooms are small by American standards for sure, but that's not our priority. We just want a charming but comfortable clean room and bathroom with no hot water issues, along with helpful staff---and not for a lot of euros we'd rather spend on shopping and all the fabulous dining Paris has to offer. One really nice benefit is the hotel sits down a narrow alley away from the bustle of Rue de Rivoli and all that jazz. So while you are only steps away from the \"scene\" you are also away from lots of noise---so while there are the usual city noises to deal with---it's a lot tamer than what I've experienced in other places.

My daughter loved the lavish decor. We had the purple room and she was delighted. In house continental breakfast was available for a small fee but we didn't use it. With access to the centre of Paris there was plenty of other options and we preferred to hit the streets and find something else. One morning a curbside cafe with a full breakfast, another day a coffee and chocolate croissant at the McDonalds around the corner. There are lots of restaurants in the area to choose from for dinner as well. The best thing for me was the price. I was on a budget and pre paid on their website for a very reasonable price. Much cheaper than the chain hotels in the area and with much more character! .", "Date": "July 27, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Kinross, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cGreat location and really enjoyed stay\u201d", "Author": "Graeme1951", "ReviewID": "UR115577478", "Content": "Stayed in a triple room for four nights.

Our room was on the first floor next to the lift, and we had paid for inter-connecting rooms. You enter through one main door, then each room is opposite each other separated by another door. One room had a double bed facing out onto the residential side street, the other two single (for the children) facing internally, all the beds were very comfortable and clean. Both rooms had adequate shower rooms with hairdrier, large mirror, toiletries fresh towels most days and maid service daily (rooms tidied, bins emptied, bathrooms cleaned and beds made - very nice touch). The air conditioning was the usual wall mounted, which are always a little noisy, but once the rooms were cool at night, we switched them off for bed so not a problem at this time of the year. Although this hotel is just off the Rue De Rivoli it was set in a residential area so the nights were quiet. There is a little supermarket around the corner from the hotel which was great for stocking up on late night snacks or lunch items for during the day, as Paris is very expensive, and saved us quite a bit of cash. The breakfast area was cosy, and at times busy, but the service was very good and the tables were cleared quickly with a wide continental selection including pastries, breads, fruit, preserves, eggs, cheese and fruit juices,which were replenished regularly so there was always enough fresh produce available for everyone. The waiting on staff served tea/coffee/hot chocolate to the table. The only issue we had, was that there were no tea and coffee making facilities in the rooms which would have cut down on costs dramatically as it was expensive to order tea/coffee/chocolate in the Hotel's small bar. The location of this hotel was excellent and after posting requests for direction help on the Tripadvisor forum before we left (thank you to those who posted and encouraged us to use public transport), we decided to brave the RER and arrived at the hotel within 35 minutes (make sure you get the most direct RER from Charles de Gaulle) after getting off the train, it was more difficult to get out of the station than it was to find the hotel, and we were amazed at just how close it was to the Metro. Anywhere we wanted to travel, if we were unsure, we just asked the reception staff at the hotel and the were excellent at advising on the best route. From our hotel either on foot or on the metro, we visited the Eiffel Tower, Sacre Coeur, Pompidou Centre, La Defense, Louvre, Notre Dame, several trips to the Pont Neuf which was just around the corner from our hotel with a great view of the Isle de la cite, followed by a couple of bus tours (day and night - definitely recommended) and the boat tour. We would definitely recommend the day bus and night bus tours, there are a few operators but we used open top sight seeing and booked the tickets in person at their tourist office on the Isle de la cite (ask at the Hotel for directions - I've forgotten the address!).

As is typical for Paris the room sizes are small but our twin room was clean and comfortable and everything worked including the free air con (v quite) and safe. The room was serviced daily (incl clean towels) and as ours was located in the very centre of the hotel there was absolutely no road noise at all (even if it wasn't the hotel is on such a quite back street I don't think you would be disturbed). The reception staff are v friendly and helpful - when we had trouble with our safe (our fault for not reading th instructions properly - it worked fine when we did!!) they were very obliging. You can also leave your cases in the luggage room when you check out if you have a few hours to kill. We got a deal with breakfast included - it was the usual French fare (breads, fruit, cheese, meat, juices, tea/coffee) not a huge range but it was fine ....although the staff were a little slow at replacing things that had run out at times. Some other points to note, the lift is small (but it works!!) and if you get a taxi up to Guare du Nord be warened - it's expensive - it cost us 18 Euros!! (You can easily get there on the RER from Chatelet if you are mobile and able to handle your luggage). For tourists there is a small supermarket within 30 yards of the front door so you can stock up for the day there. We also did the open top hop on hop off bus tours - bought a 2 day ticket for 32 Euros each and did all 4 routes over the 2 days - a great way to see Paris and we thoroughly enjoyed it .. never had to wait more than 10 - 15mins for a bus and although they were busy people do get off so you can move upstairs if there is no space intially If you have stayed in Paris in 3 star hotels before you may know they vary greatly in their standards ...... some have nice reception areas but behind that are pretty run down and not that clean.

We obviously had reservations - what if it didnt live up to its marketing? Well it certainly did that! We booked a balcony room which gave us what we needed. Smaller than you would expect for a suite, but this is common in Paris and in most cities worldwide. It was about the size of a Premier Inn Room which was fine for what we needed and cosy.

They knew it was a special occasion and knew we'd love the room. I even loved the teeny-tiny lift that took us up to the top floor. It has so much character. Indeed the whole hotel does. The continental buffet breakfast was lovely too, with a good selection and delicious croissants. But, of course, when you're in Paris you don't want to spend all your time in your hotel (tempting though it may be!) and the Grand Hotel Dechampaigne is in a fabulous location for exploring the city - a block from the Seine, short walk to Notre Dame in one direction or the Louvre in the other, or along the river banks to Musee d'Orsay, St Germain district or shopping on the rue du Rivoli, or around the Pompidou Centre. Everything is close by. We even walked to the hotel from Gare du Nord when we arrived on Eurostar - though chose to get a taxi on our way back as it was a v hot and sticky day. (It's a short hop in a taxi but a good 20-30minute walk on busy roads - so not the best with suitcases in tow). I hope I will have a chance to go back to the Grand Hotel Dechampaigne.

I travel extremely often for business, with many years of experience around Europe, but had not needed to stay in this district of Paris previously. The property is in a surprisingly quiet alley right in the heart of things, very well situated. The hotel itself is of the \"quaint\" and rustic variety, but it is a reasonably pleasant place. The rooms are quite small, typical for older hotels in Paris, but attractively decorated. The front desk staff are reasonably friendly. The individually-controlled air conditioners work very well (I wish I could say the same of many larger establishments). So, to this point, good. And if you are looking for a place for a retreat from the world while on a personal vacation, and you have all the time in the world, and you are sure you won't have to deal with their management, by all means do book the hotel. If you want to be able to attend to business or keep to a tight schedule while there, forget it. Others have mentioned the tiny elevator (and even those familiar with smaill places in Europe will not imagine just how small until you see it) and in fact it was a concern for me that if I wanted to come or go quickly from the top floor the one elevator was pretty much useless, since it only really fit one person at a time so there would be a long and unpredictable wait at peak times). Also, taxi drivers seem unable to find the place down its rabbit-warren street, despite the 1st district central location. But the primary concern is the fact that their improvised internet system simply does not work. They seem to have a single slow personal-type DSL connection whicih they attempt to share/relay throughout the property, and most of the time it is completely dysfunctional. Clearly, the staff are used to seeing problems with this - before I ever brought the problem to their attention on the first night, the night clerk had already unplugged and restarted their little wireless router several times (apparently their only solution) trying to help another client who couldn't get a stable connection. I wasted many hours for the first 24 hours at the hotel trying to get a reasonable connection anywhere on the property with no luck. The night clerk offered to simply let me use THEIR laptop. It didn't connect either, or when it did occasionally, the connection was so ridiculuously slow (think the early days of cruise-ship connections) that pages would consistently time out before they loaded. The desk staff were apologetic about the problems, and helpful to the extent that they could be, but couldn't really do anything. And while the night clerk insisted that technical support would be called the next day, clearly that didn't happen. So, they don't have a decent communications infrastructure in the place, and aren't at all concerned about business customers - it is one of those places which clearly still sees internet service as a nice little extra rather than a critical basic service. I would assume that they would have responded more earnestly if, say, their water supply suffered simiilar problems. So, regrettably I had to leave to go to another establishment, since their hotel was effectively useless for me when I had to be almost continuously online to attend to business for three weeks. Here is where my experience got surreal. Even though I had to leave after 24 hours due to the problem with their services not working, and as a result, had to incur additional expense to book at walk-up rates at a more modern establishment, they subsequently have tried to hold me responsible for three nights' worth of room charges, despite the fact that the cancelation terms per my reservation were clearly stated to be 24 hours notice. And they even had the nerve to suggest that I should be pleased with their three-day charge, since they really should charge for five since it was to be a 19-night stay! It also took them two weeks after I left to get around to telling me this, despite repeated requests that they explain why a 600-euro charge remained on my credit card. So, their desk clerks may be friendly enough, but their management is just as unreasonable as they come. t regret, therefore, having to give this property a very strongly negative recommendation, and urge you to avoid it. It is a pity, because with a bit of refurbishment to improve their infrastructure, and new management witth a better customer-care attitude, it could be quite a nice place.", "Date": "May 30, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "English Harbour", "Title": "\u201cFabulous location\u201d", "Author": "Galleonbeach3", "ReviewID": "UR29040416", "Content": "I took my two daughters and their grandmother to Paris in celebration of their grandmother's 100th birthday.

There is a lovely lobby with little bar area (combined) and another seating area attached, but I think it would only suffice for meeting others for a drink before going out. The breakfast restaurant is next to that, and breakfast is finished by 10,30hrs. We stayed on floor 6, which means one set of stairs after the lift goes to floor 5, this is easy. There are only 3 rooms up there, so it's quiet. The room was the normal Paris size, with ensuite, shower/bath, toilet and bidet. The room had an adequate wardrobe with a safe, small digital television with 10 channels including one english-language channel (CNN). The bed was firm (which I like). It was a superior room so it included tea/coffee & kettle, bathrobes with slippers and a glass of champagne each on arrival. The best thing was that the staff were lovely.

The staff were very friendly and helpful, and the rooms were clean and comfortable. Also, the location of the hotel was great; not only were we within walking distance of the Louvre and \u00cele de la Cit\u00e9, we had a metro exit and a small grocery store right around the corner - very handy for some quick and cheap breakfasts. And then there's the nearby shopping and dining... you really can't go wrong with this spot! A few notes though - just as a heads up to fellow travelers, not really criticisms of the hotel itself: - The area around the hotel can get a bit noisy at night - there were almost always a few young (possibly drunk) folk carrying on in the general vicinity in the wee hours of the morning. I don't fault the hotel for the noise - they're not located smack in the middle of a bunch of clubs or anything like that. The noise is probably just people wandering home from their nights out. I'm guessing most folks would sleep right through it; however, if you're a light sleeper you might want to bring ear plugs (the same could be said of any room on the first few floors of any hotel in the heart of Paris). On the plus side, the windows do have nice heavy drapes to keep the light (and some of the sound) out when you're trying to sleep in. - If you're reading travel reviews, you've no doubt read that Parisian hotel rooms are usually small. The room we had here (a Double Superior) was a little small compared to the usual double rooms one finds in the U.S.; however, it was still quite comfortable for myself and the hubby. We ended up going with twin beds because we know that even in the U.S., sometimes \"queen\" beds end up being doubles instead; we both wanted some space to sleep without elbowing each other the whole time. ;-) We probably needn't have worried though, as the twin beds were a bit larger than I expected. - The bathroom is also on the small side, but workable. I should mention that I am not a \"petite\" person, so if I can manage in there, I bet anyone can. ;-) On the plus side, the water was almost always hot (i think my husband had maybe one instance when there wasn't quite enough hot water for him) and the shower pressure was good. Most important to us though was that the bathroom was clean, and there weren't any problems there. - Another note about the bathroom: if you like to use a face cloth or sponge to wash up, bring/buy your own. The hotel provides guests with two large bath towels and two smaller hand towels, but no face cloths. The hotel staff were also very accommodating when I asked for extra towels (and other odds and ends). - About the Metro: There is a metro stop right around the corner from the hotel at Rue Bertin Poiree. It's just for getting in and out of the metro, though - you can't buy tickets there. There's another Chatelet metro stop close to the hotel where you can buy tickets, but I'm not sure which Exit # that one was. The first time we took the metro back to the Chatelet stop to come back to the hotel, we didn't realize that there are a bunch of exits, and we got lost - I think we ended up walking towards Forum des Halles. Anyway, if you're on the metro and just want to make a beeline right to the hotel, look for the Exit for Rue Bertin Poiree!", "Date": "November 14, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "4", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Cape Town", "Title": "\u201cVery Romantic - typical Paris\u201d", "Author": "jaydeeCapeTown", "ReviewID": "UR21781074", "Content": "Dear Madam We stayed from 17th to 25th October 2008 - Room 503.

Breakfast was average for 13 Euro, but you can't beat the convenience factor. Highlights were location and staff. The room (we were on the 5th floor) and breakfast can be improved. Tip: the restaurants adjacent to the hotel were expensive, try the Au Vieux Chatelet at 1 Place Du Chatelet next to the fountain on the river. Food was reasonable and escargot & champaign were excellent.

In the last ten years all that changed, it seems. Paris has become open, friendly, multilingual. The staff of this hotel proved that right. In the booking process there was a small problem due to a mistake I made, and they graciously and highly efficiently corrected that. The friendliness and efficiency of the staff just beamed across the counter when I arrived. I was not a difficult customer, I have to admit, but everything was done so as to make checking in, and out, smooth and fast. As for the rooms, I have noticed that some customers complained about their size. Though I appreciate spacious rooms in other cities, I know that I don't have to expect that in Paris. The square meter cost at the hotel's location near Town Hall and the Notre Dame is just too high for that. I appreciated the lay-out of the rooms on the floors. It is clear they made a maximum use of space available, but it was anyhow sufficient. Besides, I do not expect to live in my hotel room when I am in Paris. Cleanliness, bathroom facilities, all that was excellent. Wallpaper etc. showed a slightly old-fashioned, almost British taste -- but I liked the peace it gave. No fancy furniture show here. I am always very apprehensive of noise in hotels (coming from neighboring venues, streets, but especially the elevators...) ...and though I was located on the 4th floor next to the elevator, I did not hear a sound and slept to my content. I did not take their breakfast as any Paris bistrot or brasserie well chosen can offer them as tasty I suppose, and with the view on the Seine, Conciergerie, or the Halles as a bonus.

Oh yeah, and the garbage truck that came rolling down the alley at 0630hrs, waking up the whole place. (well documented in previous reviews) At this hotel, when you leave for the day, you are supposed to leave your key at the desk, when you get back you ask for your key back by room number. The problem is: They don't check ID, you say a number and they hand out a (random?) key. One night I was given the wrong key, which I realized when I made it back up to my room. I'm pretty sure I told him the correct room number and I was apolegetic when I informed the night man of the mistake. (Je suis d\u00e9sol\u00e9e...)

During my 3 night stay the electricity went off on a number of occasions while I was in the hotel, possibly more while I was out.
