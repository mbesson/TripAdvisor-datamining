{"Reviews": [{"Content": "would never recommend this we were booked to stay here for seven nights, after spending 10 nights a the Kumala pantai which we could not fault, we had a rude awakening when we were shown our rooms. They were very small with a masive bed taking up most the room we could hardly fit our surf boards in the doorway, the beds were uncomfortable, and something was falling out of the ceiling all over the single bed they had put for my son, not sure what is was but looked like some insect eggs. the water had a horrible smell and the rooms in general need a good make over.we left after one night as we could not sleep another night in those conditions, my son was horrified to think whet ever it was comming out of the ceiling all over the bed. The staff was friendly said that they would tape it up so no more stuff would fall out.we forgo our money as we had paid up front but the rest of our stay at the melasti was very nice. The breakfast was also very average yuk.we would never recommend anyone to stay here.The only nice thing about it is the garden at the beach front end.", "Date": "Nov 9, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR190631251", "Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "2", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "1", "Value": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "SydneyNess"}, {"Content": "Nice quiet hotel, breakfast included We atayed in the deluxe for 300,000 and couldnt fault it.The breakfast was included and OK.The resort meets expectations.", "Date": "Jul 12, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR925127439", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "jockeygirl"}, {"Content": "Quiet, close, clean and friendly Great hotel for mature travellers wanting a quiet, clean, cheap hotel close to everything.I don't think it is a place for families or children.
