Despite self catering, there's no kettle (we had to ask at reception for a saucepan to heat water) or similar in which to even successfully heat anything as the 'cooker', which looked like it had been unearthed from a 70's B movie, didnt heat to over boiling point and was a health hazard unto itself. The place is, like others have reviewed; nothing short of a hostel. I travelled here from the UK with a group of girls for a city break and although we spent most of the time out sightseeing, we dreaded coming back to it at night. Door to the bedroom had fallen out of it's allignment and was rotting therefore wouldnt close(that's no exaggeration, bits of it littered the floor as we pushed it ajar for privousy) there was no door to the living room which had been made into a bedroom for our stay, the doors outside were so thin it was a security issue (hands could have smashed it - and the cleaner decided to leave them wide open on 2 occasions also...). Bathroom had a window through to the next ajoining bathroom and other figures in that next room were visible making us 4 girls very conscious (unsure why this was there as it didnt open?) and was stiff with mildew and disgusting old fittings. We made the mistake of walking around the appt bare foot - when we saw how black our feet were we had to wear shoes, even when getting out of the bath. The remote control for the TV is a deposit of \u20ac10 but only English speaking station available was the Disney Channel... In any case, when one arrives somewhere where money has been spent for a memorable break (albeit not a hell of allot) you do expect it to be in good working order and, at least clean. This was unfortunately not and we would not stay here again.", "Date": "April 9, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Alcala De Henares, Spain", "Title": "\u201cAbsolutely never again.\u201d", "Author": "Madi M", "ReviewID": "UR125188625", "Content": "I came here with a large group of friends and we were all disgusted with our rooms.

It's an older unrenovated apartment with basic facilities but the staff are great and the location is fantastic, it's also economical if you want to self cater in Barcelona.

My friend and I paid over 120 euros a night for a four night stay in February. for which we got a twin bedroom, sitting room, kitchenette and cramped bathroom. On the surface this sounds good BUT the place was bare, bleak, very rundown decor (plaster coming off the walls, basin and bidet coming off the walls etc) and the kitchen was filthy. No way is this up to hotel standard - it's not somewhere you'd want to go back to after trekking round the city to relax. This is around the standard of a rundown, cheap-end student hostel. On the plus side, it's in a great location at the bottom of Las Rambla, next to the gothic quarter and just 10 minutes walk from Plaza Catalunya. But be aware that it is at the dodgy end of Las Rambla. You walk through clouds of canabis smoke from the guys hanging about the entrance and nearby canteen to get in and, at night, the single glazing in the rooms lets in all the outside noise which goes on until around 4am - motorbikes continually revving up, shouting, football chanting - on and ON! While you could theoretically fit four people into this 'apartment' with two on the pull-out sofa in the sitting room, only do so if you are really happy to rough it. Don't attempt with children, for example, if you want the family to relax and get any sleep.", "Date": "March 2, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Liverpool", "Title": "\u201cGreat Value, Great Location!!!

Save your pennies and stay at these apartments, then you will have more to spend on treats!!! Location is amazing - righ on La Ramblas and 5 min walk from the Harbour. You will always get a balcony view which on a nice walm evening is great to sit out on and enjoy the noices of Barcelona with a cold beer or wine (there is a kitchen in each room, so you can keep your food and drinks nice and fresh, also there is a supermarket just a bit up from the aparments on the otherside of the road, if you turn right as you come out). The apartments are located just over the road from the Metro - which will get you everywhere in Barcelona. Your room gets cleaned everyday, the bathrooms are clean but do need a bit of TLC - but are useable. Take your slippers cause alot of dust gets blown in and because there are no carpets your feet will be cold on the tiles and get a litle dusty.

It either just didn't work at all, or wasn't worth trying to figure out how to run. In any case it was quite warm and humid in the room. The interior and floor are crying to be refinished. While not filthy, they were by not stretch of the imagaination 'clean'. The sink water was the worst. If it wasn't supposed to be drinkable, it sure didn't say so, but it sure tasted it came straight from the ocean.

We're a family of three (child of 10 months) from the United States. We stayed here for one night (fortunately only one night!) and it was by far the worst hotel we have ever stayed in--by far! Room is filthy. Our child's feet were black within 10 minutes. The room is visibly dirty--black smudges and fingerprints on the walls, a light socket that was brown from dirt, a shower with black mildew in the corners, a floor that wasn't so obviously dirty until we saw our child's black toes, and beds that were not only uncomfortable but probably as old as the building. The water smelled terribly of rust, and so did we after taking a shower. The water temperature constantly fluctuated from scalding hot to freezing cold every 30 seconds or so, making for a long shower just adjusting the temperature of the water. We never were able to make a consistent temperature, causing us to jump in and out of the water stream as the temperature changed. On top of all this, as if anything else could go wrong, the southern part of las ramblas is a redlight district and people were partying until 6 AM--really! The building is of such poor construction we could hear the conversations (and bottles breaking and chanting and singing) from the third floor of the building.

First Off i will start with the good points:- The Apartment itsself was good. It has a seperate lounge, kitchen and bedroom so it is basically laid out like a one bedroom flat. The kitchen has all the facilities that you require and our appartment had a balcony which looked over the La Rambla. The location of the appartment is excellent if you want to be right in the heart of everything as it is right on the La Rambla and near to the Harbour. Now for the bad points:- The shower in the bathroom does not stay on the wall so you have to hold the shower over your head which can be a pain when all you want is a quick shower. The apartments themselves were absolutley freezing and didnt have any heating. In the summer i am sure this would be fine but it was 11 degrees outside and even then it was warmer outside than it was in the appartment. There is also a club across the road which comes out at 4am and the noise is unbearable. The shouting and screaming when on for about 3 hrs before it stopped.
