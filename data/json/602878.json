The man said he'd sent people there before, which I very much doubt. The reception area is very scruffy and dirty. We should have realized that the rest of the hotel would follow suit. We only had two nights there. When we arrived the room was not ready even though reception said we could go in. A man was cleaning the room, not very well, there was still dirt on the floor after he left. The only positive point was, we noticed he\u2019d changed the sheets. The room is a good size but again scruffy and gave the impression of being dirty. The bathroom is small and grubby looking, the shower head fell off the wall and they didn\u2019t bother to fix it. We told reception we weren\u2019t happy with the room but there were an Italian couple waiting to change there\u2019s too and like they said \u2018you may get ours and we will get yours\u2019, so we stuck it out for another night. Anyway, it\u2019s certainly not like the website pictures and should be avoided. The whole building is full of small hotels, it\u2019s a mess to say the least. The location is good, so check out other hotels along that road or in that area. The buses are very close by and you can walk to the train station.", "Date": "October 3, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Tampa, Florida", "Title": "\u201cGreat stay\u201d", "Author": "karthics2", "ReviewID": "UR20068112", "Content": "This hotel is a brillant place to stay.

When we dragged our cases up to the 3rd floor we were told we would be shown to our room - and were then led three blocks (but felt like more with cases in the dark) by a suspicious-looking man (we thought we were going to be led to a mugging in an alley, it was that kind of situation) to a residential apartment building which had its 4th floor converted into hotel rooms, quite separate from the hotel. Four keys are required between the main door and the room and they take some getting used to. There was a lift but we could only make it work for us going down. Once we were over the shock of this bizarre scenario it was OK - a decent room which was cleaned as in a normal hotel, a clean bathroom, no problems with 'flatmates' and a decent location within the city. There was a room set aside for breakfast but it didnt appeal to us. If you have booked this hotel, or are planning to do so, I hope you get to read this review so you know what to expect because Expedia did not warn us of anything unusual about the accommodation. If you go here already expecting to be moved somewhere else it should be OK.", "Date": "July 10, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "2", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "2", "Check in / front desk": "2", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Los Angeles", "Title": "\u201cThis place is a joke\u201d", "Author": "eddywine", "ReviewID": "UR16943641", "Content": "A friend of ours were to be blame for our sufferings. They were the one who made the reservation for the four of us. We were shuffled from one room to the other everyday. On the second day,we were asked to vacate very early in the morning , so to make room for the newly arriving guest. The owner of the room we stayed temporarily spoke only her dialect which is Italian.The building anyway has so many owners and has different names.We argued that we made a reservation already for the duration of our stay over there. Though, we were given a larger room on the following day, but it was in shamble. It was just vacated by a group of student who were on tour from Germany. The room's a/c was not working, the portable refrigerator was faulty and not operatable. The room is smelling of stench from urine. It is very unsanitary and hurriedly being done by the cleaning personnel. That very night we cannot sleep until 5:00 AM because newly arrive group of teenagers were occupying the flat that is right on top of us. They were very loud and seemed to have a party that night. We complained to the night desk person, who spoke a little English and not very helpful.", "Date": "June 15, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Check in / front desk": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Location": "3", "Value": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "OzzyRules", "Title": "\u201cWhat a dump, I was dupped\u201d", "Author": "OzzyRules", "ReviewID": "UR16106440", "Content": "THIS HOTEL IS A DUMP!!! Don't belive the pictures on the internet, these pictures are from a long time ago, the hotel is very run down. Mold in the sheetrock & shower, TV did not work. Counter person did not speak much English and would not take respnsibility for anything. No phone. We asked for more towels, the TV to be replace & the mold in the shower to be cleaned, nothing was done at the end of the day. The continential breakfast is nothing and the place where you eat is very dirty and run down also. I went there with an open mind, I really did, but had to book a hotel down the street for the second & third night at the Medici, the clerk there said they get alot of people who book a room there because the Hotel Sallustio is soooo gross. Very run down and not willing to work with you on the price when you try & leave.

I booked this hotel over the internet and was a little apprehensive regarding the room size. Upon arriving we were greated by a lovely man who spoke perfect English. Finding our room initially was a little confusing as the hotel is actually a consortium of 3 or 4 hotels owned by the same person. The rooms have recently been renovated and are tastefully done although they are not very large. The size of the room does not actually bother me as long as it is neat and comfortable with enough room to move around! There was an LCD TV, airconditioning (which was nice and cold during Rome's Summer heat!) and the bathrooms were very nicely done in modern white ceramic and chrome, however they were a litlle unpractical. The shower was only just big enough for me to fit in let alone try to move around! The basin was the largest I have ever seen and used up all of the bench space so there was not much room for toiletries but you got used to it. The Breakfast was interesting with toast, jams, coffee and tea however I could not determine what flavour the juice was meant to be! The breakfast room is quiet small and can become easy crowded but it was enough. The location is deemed Central Rome but after attempting to walk around in the first day we decided to use the Bus system, especially with the heat! This Hotel is only about 10 minutes walk from Termini Station where most of the buses go to so it is convenient from that perspective.", "Date": "November 3, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "2", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Montreal, Canada", "Title": "\u201cNot a great choice\u201d", "Author": "bluesque", "ReviewID": "UR5773479", "Content": "We did not choose this hotel, we settled for it because of the price, so our expectations were not too high. The room, while very small indeed (no more than 1m fringe around the bed and that's it!), was clean and almost cosy. The closet design (high up way above) made it impossible for me to use it without my tall husband's help. There were no unpleasant smells in the room and no noise at night, although the cleaning staff in the morning made every possible effort to wake up every guest by yelling out to each other and slamming the doors with the maximum force (probably in order to have all the rooms vacated and available for cleaning as early as possible). The bathroom was OK with the exception of the unmovable huge showerhead rigth in the middle of the showercabin, which made it impossible to take a shower without getting your hair washed as well (women will appreciate the inconvenience of this). The biggest problem was that while the hotel description features air-conditioning, there was nearly none. The temperature in our tiny room rose to 27 at night and to all our pleas the reception clerk replied that the air-conditioning does, indeed, work and is set at an appropriate level (by the way, the unit directed at his desk was blowing at full force). The other unpleasantness was the breakfast room - it stank, was very unwelcoming, and the breakfast was crap. After the first morning we never even approached it (although we could smell it from afar). All in all, I would not recommend this hotel and would not return.", "Date": "September 6, 2006"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Hotel Sallustio", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g187791-d602878-Reviews-Hotel_Sallustio-Rome_Lazio.html", "Price": "$76 - $262*", "Address": "<address><span rel=\"v:address\"><span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">Via Flavia 84</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:postal-code\">00187</span> <span property=\"v:locality\">Rome</span></span>, <span class=\"country-name\" property=\"v:country-name\">Italy</span> </span></span></address>", "HotelID": "602878", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/ProviderThumbnails/dirs/95/16/9516c8d540cfb0923797fc5dc53bbc182large.jpg"}}
