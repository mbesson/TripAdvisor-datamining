{"Reviews": [{"Content": "Worn Out Stayed there last weekend with the family and booked 3 villas.The superior or twin bed villas had a tiny bedroom and does not come with a DVD player, unlike the Deluxe rooms.The resort, though quaint, was worn out and its aging is apparent.Linen and terry items are thin and well used.Minimal lightings in the villas/rooms does not provide for a good reading ambience. It's a pity as the scenery provides for a nice atmosphere to just sit in bed and read a book!The rattan smell in the room was over-powering and gave me slight sniffles!Although it provides for hot and cold water, water pressure is very low, making it difficult to have a nice shower in the tub.Best to bring your own bath amenities as they provide tiny bottles without labels.Not worth paying an average of USD70 per night.", "Date": "Nov 4, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR430792337", "Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "2", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "2", "Value": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "3"}, "Author": "BespokedService"}, {"Content": "Trebled the price in three years but have halved their work rate. I visited this place in 2005 and paid $30 and thought it was superb; I visited in 2008, paid $70 (having haggled from the asking price of $90) and left disappointed. Polished, clean and well maintained back then but mould and mildew now graces the once gleaming walls and stone. The loungers and pillows that you would once snuggle into are now grubby. The thing that capped it last time was the jacuzzi in our bungalow - this time however it didn't even work.If you want to treble your asking price in three years you have to put some serious graft in but unfortunately these guys haven't.If you do stay, tell them $90 is too much and haggle the price (those that know they have asked too much always have room for negotiation) or all of these once lovely places will continue to rest on their laurels and continue to think that it's okay to rise their prices just like the more deserving hotels and homestays have done.", "Date": "Sep 14, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR286369216", "Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "2", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "roskolewis"}, {"Content": "Padi Prada: Warmth, Care and Ricefields We stayed at the 5-villa Padi Prada between the Monkey Forest and Jalan Hanoman, and while I found it a little out of the way (I do like to be in the middle of everything), it was lovely to look out onto the rice fields and enjoy their beauty. The room was spacious and charmingly furnished with air con, a bar fridge, safe and tea/coffee making facilities. The bathroom had a hairdryer and shampoo and conditioner. Light was low (we were told it was more romantic!) so we replaced the bedside bulbs. The TV was Indonesian only which was great for a little language study as it showed the occasional movie and program in English with Bahasa Indonesian subtitles. The bale-style varandah overlooked the ricefields and had bamboo blinds that could be used for privacy. Breakfast could be had there or in the restaurant. Breakfast was good with 3 styles and choices in them.Each lunchtime one or two coachloads of tourists descended on the hotel and learned gamalan, did cooking or painted masks. This was interesting to see and was obviously the way the hotel survived given its small number of rooms. The best thing about the hotel was the staff. Gusti, the main 'carer' was wonderful - good English and quick to recognise a problem and quick to find a solution. We had taken the advertised phone in the room to be direct dial for my husband's computer needs. Unfortunately it was not, but Gusti helped arrange for a small fee the use of the office between 7.30 and 8.30am each day. He also organised an extension in our room so we could use the laptop where there was light. This saved us having to move, but as we found out when investigating, the hotels with this level of facility were either booked or out of our price range. We paid US$75 net for our villa as it was a long stay. Published rate is US$100. The room 'boys' Putu and Komang were also helpful and friendly as was the admin staff Suzy and Andy. On our second last day they all presented us at breakfast with a thank-you for staying there so long: a delicately carved wooden horse. We were touched and have taken away fond memories of our stay.", "Date": "Sep 4, 2006", "ReviewID": "UR868785197", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "3", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "Zenophile"}, {"Content": "\u93c3\u30e6\u6e70\u747e\u70aa\u4eb4\u95ab\u6c25\u4ed2\u9288\u5b36\u7d12   showReview(19161376, 'full');", "Date": "Jun 13, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR877344734", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "-1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "4", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "lass="}], "HotelInfo": {"HotelURL": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g297701-d623542-r21522459-Padi_Prada-Ubud_Bali.html", "HotelID": "623542", "Price": "$90"}}
