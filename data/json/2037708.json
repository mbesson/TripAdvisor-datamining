We visited in August last year had an amazing time. weather was just right, could walk for miles without feeling lathargic and didn't really need a cardigan, even in the evening. The hotel was close to a metro station and was also close to a few popular tourist attractions. and lovely restaurants and clubs and bars too. It was very close to the centre of madrid and was easy to walk to all the close attractions. The room was lovely big, with a comfortable bed and enough room to snuggle and have your own space too!. there was a TV, more than enough cupboard space and a safe. The bathroom was luxurious and the shower could fit a whole group into it, it was also powerful and great to have a wash in. The hotel provided a comb, little soaps and a sewing kit too. There was a little fruit shop close by so I could get my daily dose of fruit and also plenty of cafe's and restaurants close by for breakfast lunch and dinner! Madrid is a lovely city and would love to go again. However we went to visit a friend and she found parking difficult round the hotel....but I don't think this took anything away from our fab stay at Catalonia Atocha.

The location is excellent-Anton Martin is the nearest Metro station and is really easy to use. You can get an unlimited 3 day travel pass for 13\u20ac which I would recommend as its the best way to explore the city. However, the hotel is walking distance to the key tourist attractions of which Plaza Mayor and Retiro Park are absolutley worth a visit. Whilst the road isnt the nicest/quietest, our room was on the 1st floor but we didnt hear any noise during our stay. The facilities and standards at the hotel are exceptional. The rooms are cleaned daily to a very high standard and the showers are amazing! The hotel is contemporary and comfortable with excellent wifi. There are small fridges in the room,ideal for storing pate, meats and cheese which, accompanied by freshly baked bread from the bakery next door, makes for a delightful 'al fresco' lunch on the roof terrace. There are lovely views from the 7th floor terrace which is equipped wiv sunbeds, tables and chairs and a jacuzzi and it is perfect in the sun!

Also, although on a busy road, it was one of the quietest rooms I have had in Madrid. My only problem with this hotel is its position.

The safe did not open easily. We put our laptops inside it and could not take afterwards. It took us a long time to figure out the odd way the safe would open. Internet wifi was free, but it didn't work well. Some websites were blocked (like Gmail!!!!) and the connection was very slow. Finally, the main problem: the heating system was awful.

I would stay there in a heartbeat if I am ever in Madrid again. Last note... We had breakfast on our last day since we needed to catch a train and didn't have time to go out. The breakfast was a 6 on a scale of 1 to 10 (10 being the highest).

Aint the best in Madrid though Never saw more that 1 person working at the reception. Do better be patient upon check in and check out. Staff quite helpful though.
