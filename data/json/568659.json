He spoke English very well, even though my husband is fluent in Italian, so it was nice for me to understand. He volunteered to keep our luggage until the room was vacant and then move it into our room for us so we didn't have to haul it around until the room was available. He sat down with us and explained all the busing information to us along with the open hours of each site we were interested in. Each time we ran into him on our trip he was very kind and sincere in questioning us how things were going. Americano really recieves the Excellent rating. Our accomodations were perfect too. We felt very safe as we had 3 different keys to get into our room: one for the main street level door, one for the hallway door, and one for our room. There was free internet access with free wifi if needed. The facilities were just as clean or cleaner than most hotels I've stayed in the states. The room was quiet, with the window opening to a quiet courtyard, not the road. The bed was very comfortable and had a box spring underneath the mattress I believe. The 2 other hostels we stayed were just the mattress, and were actually 2 twins laying next to each other with a queen sheet. There was plenty of space in the room. Everything in the room was good quality. There is an elevator that works great for luggage that we used when we checked out. It was very handy. Our bathroom was right next to our room and I would honestly say it felt like we were the only ones in the building and had the bath all to ourselves. There was a second one just down the hall, but never needed to use it. The location of this hotel was perfect because it was on a quiet street and 2 blocks from any transportation needed, and you have to use transportation to see Rome. Walking it wouldn't be worth the time. A&C Much More was fantastic and we will be staying there again if we ever get to go back.", "Date": "April 12, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "England", "Title": "\u201cMore like lovely apartments than a hostel!\u201d", "Author": "linziharper", "ReviewID": "UR127476758", "Content": "My boyfriend and I stayed here over the Easter Bank holiday and thought it was fabulous.

Ask him to tell you the one about Michelangelo and the Pope when he was painting the Sistine Chapel if you have the time. Air con wasn't an issue with us as we stayed in Autumn bordering on Winter. The noise from the street can be a little loud at times unless you keep your windows closed..oh, and don't expect much of a view. Decent bathroom. I especially loved the literature available in the hotel if you want some night-reading and they always left us boiled sweets in the room. Those little touches went a long way in winning me over. Lots of restaurants pave the way to Roma Termini, so dining shouldn't be an issue. Security highly rated. And I can hardly praise the service more.

Plenty of food options in the neighborhood if you don't feel like venturing deep into the city. Although, I will mention we witnessed IV drug use on the sidewalk just a few blocks away... someone was kind enough to point this out to us so we had time to cross the street.

Overall, there is nothing to complain about -- we really enjoyed our stay. One caveat which I offer to those who might be concerned about this is that this is not really a place to meet other travelers: we heard others going into their rooms but never saw another guest during our two night stay.

It is wonderfully placed for exploring Rome, just 4 blocks away from the main rail and bus station (Terrivision drop off point from Ryanair flights), and the metro/buses. A tiny little drawback is that you have to pay cash on leaving, but if you are aware, then that's really no problem.
