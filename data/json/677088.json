The metro is 2 mins away if you want it. The b&b is set right by the side of the Spanish steps and through the day is packed full of tourists just sitting around. The complementary breakfast is Ok if you don't want much to eat in the morning, failing this Macdonalds is just around the corner LOL. The rooms including the bathroom are quite small but clean, we had a power shower with a large cubical. Overall the b&b was perfect for us. Rome really opens your eyes and the attractions are breathtaking, the churches have unbelievable decor / paintings. My only moan was the prices of food and drink, I know your in a city but 14 euros for 2 coffees is taking the p. The food is good but you don't need to be a chef to knock up pasta or pitza. If your thinking of going to Rome then I recommend it and if you stay at Piazza di Spagna View, Rome I think you will be OK.", "Date": "April 6, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "arlington,tn", "Title": "\u201cgreat deal!\u201d", "Author": "KristyW87", "ReviewID": "UR120932032", "Content": "The rooms were small bathroom even smaller but i hear thats common with most hotels but for the price you cant beat it.

Our room was very tight for three. Clean but definitely dated. Could use a makeover with the bedspreads and curtains. I gave this a low rating mainly because the bathroom toilet did not flush properly which was a problem and because the room was small.

The location is wonderful--the Spanish steps are 2 minutes away, and there is a metro stop nearby that can take you anywhere else in the city.

They also had a computer available downstairs that you could use (provided that you buy an internet pass). The rooms were comfortable, and the bathroom was bigger than most European bathrooms.

The view was marvelous overlooking the historic Spanish Steps. Tourists would be jealous to stay here. Staff friendly and helpful. Rooms were quite dated and could be cleaner. Linens were clean, so that was good. Bathroom was tiny, again very dated, but functional. Having ensuite in a Rome hotel is lucky, so I was glad to have that at least. Breakfast was served in hotel room as part of the rate. This hotel is considered a \"guest house\" so it is within a building with other commercial or private dwellings. The building where the hotel is located is not marked. It is probably a good idea to take the address and a photo of the building so you go to the correct location. Near the door, the intercom reflects the name \"Piazza di Spagna View\". Ring the buzzer and someone will direct you to the 4th floor. Take the tiny lift up and there you are. Be prepared for noise when the windows are open as this is a huge tourist attraction and there is noise night and day. One of the things that made the hotel even more charming and made one feel like they were in the true Rome! Some pictures are provided, but just could not do it justice.

Unfortunately, despite the fact we had a reservation for 2 rooms for 3 nights, when we arrived the woman in charge told us that our first night's stay would have to be in another hotel way far out of the city center (she had pre-arranged it for us, rushed us as quickly as possible out of Piazza di Spagna View, and paid for our cab to the other hotel) because the air conditioning was broken. We said we didn't care if the AC didn't work, but she said the technician would be working in our rooms late into the night. Well, it turns the AC problem was a lie and actually other people were in our rooms and she had double booked our first night. The maid who served breakfast was lovely, but the woman in charge was totally untrustworthy and rude.

We were really surprised to find out that our choise couldn't have been better..!!! Both rooms were spotless and had perfect view of spanish steps!!!all hotels near by were double even triple price and i m sure they didn't had such a nice view..!! the rooms looked much better in reality than in all fotos we saw online untill that time in booking sites... the walls were covered with nice yellow cloth and the whole floor had nice warm carpet! the girl in the reception was really really kind and sweet and wiilling to answer in any question! the location just couldn't be better...everything was within walking distance...and the biggest shopping street just opposite! and of those who dont like walking the metro station is just in the corner..! make sure you remember the address as the hotel is in the fourth floor of a big white building in piazza di spagna and has no big label to easily spot it(something that scared us at the beggining but it seams that many many hotels in rome are like that..only a floor inside a building...and prooved to be absolutely safe) we read in some reviews not to expect much of the breakfast but it came out just fine....croisant,bread,butter,honey,marmelade,rusks,juise,yoghurt,coffee(and they were really kind to bring me milk as i didn't drink coffee)which was served in our room the hour we have asked. having breakfast with such a view was just amazing....! the truth is that you must not expect much of the bathroom as it's a simple old type bathroom however it is so clean and the whole room so satisfactoring that makes no difference! its not a five star hotel but i would DEFINATELY recomend it.

You have to find the right door (easy) and ring the bell to get in. The lift is ready for the museum, but I still suggest that you use it because the hotel is on the 4th floor.
