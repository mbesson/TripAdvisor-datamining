During the night it was impossible to sleep, because of the noisy girl in the room close to us, receiving men from the afternoon to 2 am...The breakfast was poor, without milk. The day after we came back to hotel at 7 pm and the room was not cleaned: 110 euros per night for a double room and not cleaning service included? And the girl of the room close to us was still \"making noise\" with a man... Therefore, we decided to go away. The staff of the hotel forced us to pay also the second night, even if we protested against the cleaning, the noise and the hotel closed...they just offered us to change room and promise to clean the room the day after...after a discussion we accepted to pay the second night and went away, because we did not want to stay there! We were also scared, because it seemed that the only customers of the closed hotel were us and the prostitute! Terrible experience...we found another hotel in sultanhamet, cheaper, bigger, more beautiful and clean!!

The first night, the hotel was over-booked ( can happen) but we were not informed about it until credit card debit had been blocked. First we signed and then we were told it was full. The room we were given in another hotel was a downgrade to a room size of about 9sqm and cost \u00e2\u201a\u00ac59 on the web as to the \u00e2\u201a\u00ac99 we had had blocked on our card. The difference was not offered to us straight away and we had to fight to reach an agreement that we only pay \u00e2\u201a\u00ac25. Correctly for all the upheaval involved, we should either have had to pay nothing for the night or an upgrade in hotel. The next day we did get put in a nice twin on the top floor with balcony and sea view which was quite comfortable. I did mention to the owner that the balcony window, altho new, was either warped or not installed correctly as there was 1cm gap the length of the window where the wind blew in from outside at 4\u00c2\u00b0. In the bathroom the plug socket was hanging out the wall, there was no heating on in the room altho it was 4\u00c2\u00b0 outside and we couldn't get the aircon to blow warm air but it was warm under the blanket. The bedding and beds were quite comfortable and internet worked well. The hotel still has its main entrace sealed closed with an official wire and tab and all guests were ushered out the back door thru the kitchen. The kitchen door is always kept closed by a blind and some-one is there to open the blind and close the blind as you go in and out. So as Eire 2002 mentions above, we, as guests had the feeling of being smuggled in and out.Not quite what one would expect for \u00e2\u201a\u00ac99 per night. But the taxi and shuttle drivers all seem to be informed as we were always collected at the back door. Something not quite right there. The breakfasts were nice with plenty of fruit, egg, cheese, ham, turkish specialities. The staff working there all pleasant and helpful", "Date": "October 21, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "1", "Sleep Quality": "1", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Dublin, Ireland", "Title": "\u201cUnexplained occurrences, poor service\u201d", "Author": "Eire2002", "ReviewID": "UR118920971", "Content": "We spent 4 nights at the Sultan Palace hotel. The rooms are comfortable and the breakfast is good, however: 1) on our second night at 3am, one of the staff (Emin) entered our room and I immediately woke up. Before I could speak to him, I heard him saying sorry and he quickly left.. My wife woke up and rang reception. Emin said he entered our room by mistake, as he allegedly was organising a taxi for a sick kid in room 104 (we were staying in room 401). Although the sick kid story was true, we still can't understand how we got our room mistaken for one on the first floor and why he decided to enter the room using a staff key without knocking or ringing. Needless to say, myself and my wife were terrified and couldn't sleep properly after that. To make things worse, on the last night another staff member did exactly the same, opening our door without knocking or giving any notice. I wonder if they keep a note of where their guests are staying at all... A few hours later the same staff member comes knocking on our door offering us a big plate of fruit (all we wanted was to be left alone and be assured no one would bolt through our door again...) 2) during our stay, we couldn't use the front door of the hotel and staff would insist we leave the hotel every morning through the kitchen door at the back of the hotel (see non-English review below). One day we left and walked around the corner to see 3 police cars and 6 policemen standing at the door discussing something with staff. We asked them about it and no one gave us any explanation. At night, one of the staff would sit on a sofa on the street keeping an eye out on the door and the whole reception would be kept in darkness. Only on our last day, one of the managers (the only one who could speak English properly) told us that they had to keep the front door locked because the building being refurbished next door (it had some tarpaulings but wasn't about to collapse...) was unsafe and the Turkish authorities wouldn't let them use front door (that didn't seem like a good explanation to us). On one of the nights they seemed to be moving guests from the rooms facing the front of the hotel to the rooms at the back (on kitchen side). Regardless or not if that story is true (I suspect there is something more to it...), having to leave through the back door of the hotel felt like we were being smuggled in and out of the hotel and just doesn't feel right when you are paying 109 euro a day for your room... 3) We booked a room with sea view, and on first night they said they only had a room on the first floor, from which you struggle to see the sea (you have a tiny glimpse of the bay). The next day they moved us to the 4th floor, where you could actually have a proper seaview and balcony. So I would be a bit careful with their definition of seaview...", "Date": "October 4, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Toronto, Canada", "Title": "\u201cConvenient locale and comfortable\u201d", "Author": "Shehnaaz", "ReviewID": "UR116488675", "Content": "The hotel is conveniently located close to the square and the blue mosque. It was very clean and had fairly spacious rooms. There were four of us, our two boys ended up with a room with a nice view. Our room was smaller and didn't have much of a view. When we asked for a change, there were no problems and we ended up with an equally nice room. The owner Senol Fehmi and Sefa, the receptionist were both very helpful. They helped us book our next place and had to work hard at it since a lot of places in Bordrum were already booked up. I'll never forget as the taxi got there to take us to the bus station, Sefa handed me 4 bottles of cold water and stood there waving goodbye and we left. The only problem is the hotel is tricky to find and our taxi driver had to ask around. Breakfast buffet was amazing. It's typical turkish with the choice of different cheeses, cucumbers and tomatoes, olives, bread, honey, different fruit preserves,fruits, baclava and other sweets, boiled eggs, tea and coffee. I might have missed something. My boys loved the bathroom..it was small but modern.

Entrance is thru the kitchen.. according to Senol the front door should be open soon after some ironing of terms with the local Turkish gov't. The hotel is located 50 meters from the entrance of the Mehmet Pasha Mosque. About 5 - 15 min on foot to the Hippodrome, Blue Mosque, Basilica Cistern, Hagia Sophia, Topkapi Palace, and the little tram stations Cemberlitas and Sultan Ahmet. The hotel is new, rooms are not big, but very clean and very comfortable with sound proofed windows (helps if you don't want to be woken up by the early morning \"call to prayers\". They have a roof terrace which has good views of the Sea of Marmara -- unfortunately without furniture (yet). The breakfast was excellent and quite varied. The staff are very friendly and helpful. Senol had offered an airport pick up upon arrival via email, unfortunately we read it when we were already at the hotel. He also gave good information on all queries we had and has tips for everything in Istanbul and Turkey in general. We came back to the hotel around 10pm on our first night and were looking for some places to eat, the staff helped us order from Saray restaurant and had food delivered to the hotel for a few TL -- the food was absolutely fantastic! We greatly appreciate Senol and his staff as they helped us book another hotel late one night for our trip to Selcuk, offered to use their laptops for free, had free wi-fi in the rooms, arrange our taxis for the airport and prepared breakfast for our early departure (7am). Senol and his staff were the epitomy of Turkish hospitality at it's best.
