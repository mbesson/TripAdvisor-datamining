City Club also located within a short brisk 10 minute walk from the Port Authority which is perfect since it works for the majority of airport transportation services I use. I went Newark Airport Express this time. What I liked best: . Great service, the front desk staff member Danielle was knowledgeable and efficient. She direct us to two local restaurants (one for lunch and the other for brunch and both were great value and food) . Check out time is Noon and free wireless . Delicious cookies with turn down service . Hand delivered bills the evening before . Locally produced and distributed toiletries by CO Bigelow What to live with: .

It was a perfect fit for us because we were able to stay in a queen luxe room which had a very comfortable queen size bed and also a single \"day bed\" for our son. Most NYC hotels only offer 2 \"double beds\" so this was a benefit for us. A good nights sleep is very important after walking the city all day and then getting up the next day to do it all over again! The room was quite small, but the bathroom was huge! Nice amenities, and closet and mini bar were hidden behind the wall! ( our 14 year old thought that was so cool! ) I have to say, it was a nice change from our usual \"Marriott\" kind of hotel room. It enhanced the whole NYC experience! We did have one problem though. Our air conditioning broke on the second night, and the staff was there with a fan but couldn't do anything about it until the next day, and the hotel was completely booked! Luckily the temp was ok. The fan helped, and by the time we arrived back in our room the following day it was working again. We might not have been as happy if it had been in the middle of summer though!

I decided to return to see if my experience could be replicated. It was not, it was exceeded!!! As usual the doorman was ready with both assistance with luggage and advice about things to do. I booked late and through a third party site, during a very busy time in NY. While I was prepared for a broom closet with a bed, I was upgraded without request upon arrival. Later in my stay I met the manager who seemed genuinely welcoming which seems almost surreal in NY. I had to come back to the city the following week, and mentioned this to the manager as I was checking out. I had checked the 3rd party site, but the City Club wasn't showing any availability. Not only did the manager secure a room for me, but also at an extremely competitive price. He also gave me his card. I shot him an email the next week to inform him of my arrival time and BOOM. Another upgrade, this time to the two story suite. All I can say is don't die and go to heaven without staying in one of these unique rooms which bring the original crown molding casts into arms reach, boast two story windows, and a spiral staircase that is ultra hip....amazing, and would be well worth the standard suite price. Let me give 2 more quick asides about this place. 1. I was running late when i realized that I had forgotten a toiletry item. A call down to the front desk rendered a knock on my door within 2 minutes - this is the advantage of a truly boutique hotel. Larger 5 star properties would be hard pressed to match that response time. 2. The front desk called to tell me that my driver had arrived. Then a few seconds later called back to inform me that it had begun to rain lightly and I should be sure to bring my courtesy umbrella from the room. The City Club is still in a great central location, with great design, and amenities, but it continues to shine because of the great service from the staff top to bottom.

Judged against other mid-town, theater-district hotels, the City Club Hotel is a good, functional choice. Positives: The excellent location on 44th Street's \"club row\" right between the venerable Algonquin and Iroquois Hotels; a wonderfully helpful front-desk staff; reasonably spacious rooms (by New York bed-in-a-closet standards); good bedding; excellent, flexible lighting; two glorious chocolate-swirl cookies with the turn-down service (one of the very few times I've been impressed by such \"freebie\" snacks); thorough cleanliness; and no sign of bedbugs (a serious problem in Manhattan today). The negatives: Rooms need refreshing (getting just a bit tatty here and there); gloomy, horror-movie-dark hallways; and, despite trading on the location in the former City Club, there's no trace of the old club atmosphere or interior architecture.

I had cancelled at The Mansfield down the street because of poor reviews about the size of the rooms! Lord knows how small they must be. For example, the foot of the king bed is TWO feet from the wall. I literally had to walk sideways in order to get from one side of the bed to the other. The \"separate sitting area\" served as the only place to put our luggage. There is no drawer space for those anticipating a longer stay, and the closet is so small that we ended up hanging most of our clothes from the shelf over the seating area. Elsewhere you'll read reviews about the TV behind a mirror. Well, there's a reason. There isn't enough space in the room to have a TV on a stand or even to hang a flat screen on the wall. Nice idea for space saving. Best I can tell from peering through the mirror it also is an excuse for providing nothing more than an antiquated CRT TV instead of the flat screen that is now standard fare in even most Hampton Inns. Here's my suggestion. I got a peak at a queen room, and it seemed bigger, but if you want a king size bed either demand (i.e. a request won't do!!) a guaranteed King Luxe on the street side of the hotel (which also presumably includes some light from outside) or stay elsewhere (unless you like accommodations like the cabin on a boat) and come to db Moderne bistro to eat.", "Date": "September 24, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Rio de Janeiro, RJ", "Title": "\u201cTHE hotel in NYC\u201d", "Author": "toniatigre", "ReviewID": "UR118012759", "Content": "We stayed at the hotel for 3 days, went to Philadelfia for one day, and came back to stay for 5 more days.

You can get to Times Square in 5 minutes, 5th avenue shopping (for the ladies) in 5 minutes, Empire State Building/Macys about 5-10 minute subway ride away. If you're worried about noise, don't be.

The rooms were clean, and the bathrooms well maintained (except for 1 thing, I'll mention in the cons) 3) Courteous staff The front desk was nice, usually has a door man there to open the door for you in the mornings, will hold luggage for you if you need them to on day of checkout.

The bed was large (although the free update to their second level of room - the Queen Luxe - probably helped there) and extremely comfortable.

The TV was behind a mirror which was a bit odd, and the mirror kept making me think there was another room through the gap in the wall (it was placed to look a bit like a doorway).

The room furnishings are very nice (contemporary and warm) and the bed was very comfortable. The bathroom was well appointed, and luxurious, albeit small. My bedroom windows were covered with drawn shades when I arrived, and when I opened them, they both looked directly at a brick wall only a few feet from the outside glass.

Small complaint - I did not receive turn down service however my \"do not disturb\" sign was hanging on the door until about 5pm. Still, it would have been nice for them to attempt to turn down the room after 5pm. I arrived back around 11pm to find my room unserviced. Another small complaint is that the room doors are fairly loud when they close, and throughout the night several people came and went on our floor and the noise that their doors made when closing was startlingly loud. The walls are thin, and noise travels easily in this hotel. Another small complaint - the wireless internet is awful, but the wired internet is fine. Bigger compaint - the heating/cooling unit in the room was unacceptably noisy. All night long it was turning on and off every 15 minutes, and the noise was enough to prevent a good nights sleep. To give an idea - the unit was noisy enough that if you were watching TV and it came on, the TV volume needed to be roughly doubled to continue to hear it.

The day we were supposed to arrive she became sick and could not leave the house. Admittedly, I tried to cancel the morning of our planned arrival (the cancellation policy was the night before, and I had booked the room two days prior) - but said that although my first choice was to have the cost of the room refunded, I would also be happy to use the room by the end of January. First I was given a run-around and told to contact Expedia - then Expedia contacted the hotel on my behalf - while informing me that the refund decision was up to the hotel. Ultimately, the manager refused to refund the cost of the room or allow me to use it by the end of January - while at the same time assuring me that he would do all he possibly could to re-book the room/refund the money. At around 8 that evening, my sister decided to call City Club to see if the hotel had any rooms available and was told TWICE that the only rooms available were two duplex suites at $550+; in other words, the (much cheaper) King Lux room had been booked/was not showing as available. When I called to confront the manager, he insisted that he had not booked the King Lux room, but the reason it was not showing as available was because it was booked on Expedia. That was infuriating!!! Either he was lying about the room not being re-booked or else not only had he not made any effort to re-book it, but even if a potential visitor had called about the room - the hotel was not even showing it as available. This certainly created a lot of bad will. While I was disappointed that the manager was inflexible (even though he was perfectly within his bounds given the hotel's clearly stated policy, and I can understand the reasons for his decision) - what upset me was being lied to. The manager should not have said he would try to re-book the room when it was not even showing as available to be booked or worse yet telling me it was not re-booked when it really was.

Sure the lobby is tiny but there no point hanging out there. You can get room service from the semi famous bistro next door too. Guest have access to a fitness centre down the street, enough weights and machines to keep gym rats happy, but limited hours - especially weekends. The location is pretty good, around the corner (and a couple of streets) from Times Square on one side and Grand Central on the other. The street get pretty quiet and dark at night as it's parallel to the busy areas but still looked safe. It wasnt perfect though; there was a great view of the brick wall next door from the small window and virtually no natural light. Service was generally good; housekeeping and door staff were excellent, reception friendly and efficient apart from an incident at check-in when I requested twin beds and was curtly told by the receptionist that my reservation showed a queen onscreen. It would have been nice and more professional if she had checked to see if such a room was available rather than flatly refusing such a request (especially since there was no price difference). Also got charged for something that I never used and which was never explained, and they cheekily billed my card after I left too - wasnt a huge amount but out of line nonetheless.

DB Moderne, one of NY's best mid-priced restaurants, can be reached through the hotel lobby, and you can even put your restaurant tab on your hotel bill (although the two businesses are separate), One amusing thing about the room decor is that it tries to camouflage things. If the front desk neglect to tell you that the TV is behind the painting (or wherever), you'd never find it. I thought at first there was no closet, then realized it had been cleverly hidden with the wallpaper. There were a few things I didn't care for. My room on the second floor faced the street and wasn't soundproof. The shower curtain didn't keep the water from splashing all over the floor. But those are the only negatives I can think of.

You could hear every noise in the hall and other people's rooms and the cover to the heating unit kept falling off of the wall. Then to top off the experience I notice that my credit card had an extra charge of $30.00 on it. I called to the hotel and they told me it was for a bag of potato chips, a small bottle of spirits, and a half a bottle of red wine.

Not being able to sleep all night on either night ruined my trip. At first, I was impressed by the design of the hotel. My room (#305) was stylish and clean. The real story started after mid-night when the huge AC noise from the next building woke me up. At 2 AM, I thought if I got really tired, I should be able to go to sleep despite the noise. However, I wasn't able to go to sleep by 4 AM. So I called the front desk to ask him to check if the windows were open because the AC noise was huge. He stopped by to check the windows. They were all closed. So he switched me to another room on the 6th floor (# 602). It was a very warm room. There was also the similar kind of AC noise although not as loud as in the previous room. I figured I must turn on the room AC to cool down the air which would create more noise. Therefore, I stopped by the front desk to ask them to switch me to another room. They switched me to room #202 that faced the front street at 4:30 AM. I was able to go to sleep despite the growing traffic noise because it was not nearly as bad as the AC noise. Then I expected the second night to be relatively peaceful. However, I was completely wrong! At 1:30 AM, a working truck stopped in front of the building with engines running and people talking for at least half an hour. It felt like a construction project going on. After the crew left, I felt relieved because I wouldn't have expected another construction project coming back on one night! At 3:30 AM, another working truck stopped in front of the building with engines running and people talking. I called the front desk and asked why there were so many construction projects going on in the middle of the night. The front desk told me they were garbage trucks collecting garbage. The one that showed up at 1:30 AM was to collect trash from the hotel right across the street. The one that showed up at 3:30 AM was to collect trash from this hotel. Reason for my not knowing this the night before was that I moved to this room at 4:30 AM after struggling all night the night before!

Small rooms, low lighting, dark decor, dark brown tile on the floor, stark in furnishings. Very much a man's retreat. The bath was all dark brown granite, no tub - just a large open concept shower. Even the Bigelow toiletries were in dark brown bottles. Having forgotten my shampoo, I used the hotel provided one (Hermes) and now smell like I'm wearing men's cologne. The room had two old fashioned wooden paned windows on either side of the bed neither of which opened. However, you wouldn't have wanted them to open anyway since the glass was dirty with soot and both faced out to other similar old buildings whose windows were only about 10 feet away. The window coverings were only pull down shades that were a dirty beige (one of which had a huge patch of a different color right in the middle.) Given the horrible condition of the windows and the non-existent view, I kept the shades down the entire time. This only added to the dark depressing feeling of the room. The bed also faced directly toward the entry door and the TV was hidden behind some artwork, built into the wall beside the bed. You couldn't see the TV from bed without getting a crick in your neck, but had a clear view of the brown entry door.

If you really wanted to get a lot of work or reading done in the room, you'd be stuck sitting on the bed or camped in the bathroom. Luckily that wasnt the case for me.

As it turned out, we were delighted with our choice and would definitely stay here again. For a start, we were pleasantly surprised at the spaciousness of the room (second floor facing the street) - we entertained six people for drinks with no difficulty whatsoever. Comfortable bed and furniture - great bathroom with excellent products and wonderful shower. (I missed having a bathtub, but apparently there are some rooms that do.) Maid service was thorough and reliable - they leave huge and delicious chocolate chip cookies as part of their \"turn-down\" routine - a mixed blessing if you've just had an enormous dinner! However, what really set this trip apart was the charming and helpful staff. It seemed as if nothing was too much trouble for any of them, and every request - tickets, a cab, a dinner reservation, directions, info. about skating, shopping etc. etc. - was handled efficiently with a smile. We never had to wait for help at the front desk, which can sometimes be a problem in larger hotels - and people like David and Juliette (?) started to feel almost like friends by the end of the week. As with any hotel, there were some minor negatives - the lobby is very small, and waiting there would be a problem as there's nowhere to sit. The room could definitely do with more storage ( and there's no point in having an \"invisible\" closet door that won't stay closed!) Some reviews mentioned the lack of lighting in the bathroom, but there is in fact a less-than-obvious dimmer switch - maybe a small discreetly-placed sign would help.

The hotel is located on the north-side of 44th St. between 5th and 6th Ave. It is also sandwiched between the Algonquin and Iroquois Hotels, and across from the \"famous\" Royalton. The doorman Ray showed us up to the room and gave us a brief overview of how everything works in the room. We walked in to the perfectly dimmed room with smooth jazz Christmas carols playing all throughout the suite. The spiral staircase to the bedroom instantly grabs your eyes. Once you look beyond that you see the giant floor to ceiling windows with a door that leads to your own private terrace that overlooks 44th st. To the left is toward 5th ave, to the right is Times Square, which is literally 1.5 blocks or a 2-5 minute walk. Once we got done talking in the sights, sounds, and smells of the city we ran upstairs to check out the bedroom and bathroom. The bedroom is partitioned only by a glass railing that allows you to look outside as well as downstairs. The bed is extremely comfortable, especially after an exhausting day of walking all over the city. The bath has a lot of charm as well. I didn't think that I'd like the chocolate marble, but I was pleasantly surprised when I saw it in person. It really bring an elegant look to the bath. The shower isn't very wide, but could comfortably fit two. There is also an automated privacy shade that cover the entire length of the floor to ceiling windows. They offer a breakfast as room service or available for dine-in at the db Bistro Moderne for $13.95. We never got a chance to check it out but there is a great place a few doors down, toward 6th Ave and Times Square, called The Red Flame, which has great food, service and prices! If you are looking for a place to unwind and have a few drinks be sure to check out O'Lunney's. It's on 45th St. between 6th & 7th Ave. Paul the bartender is funny and keeps you on your toes. One night we went over to the bar at the Royalton and it was about as expected, a hipster bar, with hipster prices. O'Lunney's is 2 for 1 for the money compared to the Royalton. Overall, my experience with the City Club was amazing. The entire staff was amazing and extremely helpful. My only complaint was that the downstairs TV didn't work initially. I called the front desk and they immediately sent someone to fix it. We then found that the remote didn't work and was missing a battery, however when the bellman came up with the battery, the remote still didn't work. The bellman must had left and came back 3-4 times trying to fix the remote before finally getting frustrated and giving up.

To best describe the hotel, I'll describe it's neighbors. Across the street is The Royalton, an Ian Schreggar property that is consistent with the quazi-club feeling of the lobby, complete with ample seating, hip crowd, and drink service. A few doors down, The Sofitel guardian of the epi-european inspired lodging experience. If you are can't envision the feeling of the City Club, make note that this block also includes the Harvard Club, Yacht Club, New York Bar Association, and Princeton Club. OK....now you're getting it. The most priveledged little street in NY, with it's requisite understatement. The City Club has amazingly taken in all of these accounts as its' own. It's non-descript signage ( a visiting friend couldn't find it having walked past the entrance twice) and cozy loby with a front desk that should only accomodate one, but always seemed to hold three-ready to accomodate staffers, give the feeling of a very private place to be. Yet, don't think heavy wooden beams and shelving, and superflous cabinetry. Rather the design of City Club is neat, soft, and airy. It seems to have the cool feel of the Royalton, just not the space. It soon becomes evident that this is by design. I booked our room directly through the company site, and indicated that this was our honeymoon. We were given a wonderful room overlooking 44th St. which easily was the most lodging space I've ever experienced in Manhattan. The design while efficent is not actually modern, but more transitional. Cool guy features include Ipod Docking alarm clock, a television that shows through wall mirror, and the ultimate answer to in-room entertainment, a complimentary list of DVD's to be delivered from the front desk. A courtesy bottle of wine and cookies awaited us in our room. We quickly felt torn between exploring the city or soaking up this unique experience. We decided to go walk-about, which is the second reason to stay here. Cool things are steps ahead. We did take a drink at the Royalton which confirmed our suspcicions great place for cocktails, probably not a place to lay your head. We attempted to hang at the Sofitel, but the place seemed to be oover run with families, and fuddy duddies. Of course neither group is bad except if you're looking to kick it in NY to round out your honeymoon. OK back to the City Club....we decided to go in and reqroup. We saw our favorite bellman. A breif aside explains why. We drove up to NY from DC in our White Yukon Denali. Upon arriving at the Hotel, while my wife remained in the truck I got the attention of the bellman, and explained that we were checking in, needed help with baggage, and inquired about valet parking. However, each of my requests seemed to be a slight disconnect for him. After asking if all of the luggage needed to be collected, he informed me that I could park in front of the door. Which if you know NY is the craziest thing ever suggested. While he showed my now disembarking wife to the room, and managed the bags, another staffer said nothing about parking on the street, but directed me to a garage, and even held traffic so I could make the manuever. When I arrived to our room, my wife was laughing with tears in her eyes. Apparently, my odd interaction with the bellman was because he thought she was a celebrity and I was her driver. Apparently, Yukons are now the fleet of the chic, my all black outfit appeared more uniform then stylish, and her waiting in the truck with sunglasses and fur coat all communicated something different to someone who obviously has gotten used to a very different clientle. We got the biggest kick out of it, and shared laughs with the staff about our new found celebrity for the rest of our visit. If there is an achilles heel for this place it is only that room service appears to come from a diner a few doors down the street. In winter this almost gurantees that your food can not be piping hot. Although, since it i s adiner it seems almost any request can be satisfied. I know this isn't a traditional hotel review, about towels, and high speed internet, but that's because this is not a traditonal hotel. It's a place that serves as base of operations for hanging in the city, and returning to a quiet, comfortable, and upscale environment to recharge your batteries only to do it all over again.

This is a unique alternative to the more mainstream name-brand hotels out there. Very quaint, modern decor, although some rooms were a bit small, it really provides all that is needed. If you are looking for a quiet, comfortable place to lay your head at night, this is a great place. The bed was very comfortable. The 2nd floor provides a comfortable, quiet space to spread out...with internet access. The location is one of the best. Just a block or two from 5th Avenue and high end shopping, with a short cab ride to the south into Greenwich Village area. It really is a very central location, and is removed from the craziness of Times Square. It's actually a very quiet street. The staff were very friendly and accomadating and provided information on what to do and where to go. It's small enough that they actually recognize you after a day and greet you with a warm smile upon entering to retire for the night. That was really nice, something you don't get with a larger hotel group. Continental breakfast was provided every morning, which was also very sufficient. Would definitely return here again in the future.", "Date": "June 20, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "1", "Service": "2", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Minneapolis", "Title": "\u201cNoisy Design; Lousy Front Desk Staff\u201d", "Author": "bseems", "ReviewID": "UR5270562", "Content": "I checked into the room and immediately questioned whether the room was the one I reserved (and was paying for). I had to show the bellman (all of whom were very nice) a printed reservation to convince him it was the wrong room. So I was put into another room only to have another guest try to enter the room a little while later as the front desk assigned him the same room. The toilet was not working when I arrived. I removed the top and reconnected it, which made it work, although the flusher was pretty much hanging from a thread the whole time. (I didn't tell the desk about this until I checked out since I had already been through the rigamarole at the beginning.) I was supposed to have 3 free breakfasts with my 3 room nights but I wasn't told anything about this upon check-in. I had to ask the front desk clerk about it later and after some checking, he realized I was correct. He said I would have to try to convince the restaurant host not to charge my room for the breakfasts because they weren't used to not charging the room. Despite my trying to convince the restaurant staff not to put the breakfasts on the bill, they did, and I had to work that out again with the front desk staff when I checked out. Oh, also, there wasn't even a breakfast available on the third morning as the kitchen was closed. I mentioned all of this to the front-desk staff upon checking out and they did absolutely nothing to remedy the situation aside from removing the two breakfasts from the bill. (There wasn't even any refunding for the lost breakfast.) Lastly, the hotel has some fundamental design problems in terms of noise mitigation. The hotel is dormitory-like in terms of the way sound carries. That is due to the fact that there are no carpets anywhere (or other sound-abatement tools), and also because the doors all slam very loudly. This may not apply to the suites as the rooms are probably set back from the hall, but for most of the (very small) rooms, the beds are not far from the loud hallway, so if you are anything but a very, very deep sleeper, you will hear late night folks in the hall and returning to their rooms. In short, the trendy design and friendly bellmen could not make up for an otherwise poor experience, and the front desk did not seem too concerned.", "Date": "May 31, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Service": "1", "Rooms": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "Geneva", "Title": "\u201cNever again\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR5227419", "Content": "Found of Boutique Hotels this one makes me wonder if I should not forget about BH in the future....For 305 USD you get a room the size of...your bed, staff look at you as if you were coming from a different planet when you complain about it, and have nothing to say.

We found the rooms to be a decent size for a family of 5 adults, nicely appointed with some well thought details. We had a double bed in each room as well as a daybed (the one in the king bedroom was a bit tight so we used the one in the queen room); it was made everyday, as opposed to what someone said in a previous post.

Just walking room around the beds, but you're not going to New York to hang out in the room all day. The staff was extremely attentive and responded immediately to requests. We got a great price, $399, through express-res. The rooms were very clean and in good shape. Nice sound system in the room with a dvd player and complementary movies. TV was kind of odd, as it was placed behind the mirror. There was some glare when the lights were on in the room but it was still pretty viewable.

This price point is very good value for what you get considering other available rates at other hotels. The most remarkably good point was the service. The bell- and doormen were all young-ish men (not so much the groomed and plucked Calvin Klein ad types with attitude that you find at, say, the Mondrian in LA, but more Gap-ad types -- but with none of the immaturity) and I was floored and amazed at how professional and helpful they all were. How have they made people this young so professional?? I would really like to know. They grabbed a cab for me and pre-loaded my luggage in the cab without my having to ask for assistance. They were energetic and \"hop-to-it,\" an unusual quality in a city and profession where it's easy to present an exhausted or weary demeanor. The front desk is also run by a very professional gentleman. When I checked in the night staff presented me with an Internet password automatically. Of course, I started off with a good experience, because I was upgraded to a large king room from a queen deluxe. I would pay between $250 to $300 for a room of this type, but probably not above $300. The Hermes amenities are delectable and really set the City Club apart from other hotels. I was at first a little put off by the thick plastic sheet that serves as a shower curtain, but subsequently realized how functional it is -- it really serves to keep steam in the tub area and creates a lovely little sauna effect. I thought that was extremely well-considered and designed. The bathroom in the king room is quite large. Free internet is lovely. I thought the projection TV behind the 2 way mirror was also a thoughtfully designed space saving touch (although I couldn't get the thing to work after my gracious bellman Paul demo'd it for me). True that the fake cork stick-um tiles are a bit off putting and the closet is miniature, even in the king room. The elevator smelled positively rank/dank. But for $250-$300/night for this size of room, I had a lovely experience and would definitely return.", "Date": "March 4, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Service": "3", "Rooms": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "San Francisco, CA", "Title": "\u201cTiniest hotel room I've ever seen...seriously\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR4570528", "Content": "This was the smallest hotel room I've ever seen in the U.S. Stayed there on business last fall and wasn't really impressed for the price.

I find it difficult to believe that this hotel is ranked #74 on tripadvisor.com out of over 300 hotels in Manhattan. I guess there are City Club moles on this site voting for their hotel. The bathroom was a good size with wall to wall brown marble. Hermes bath products are a cheap grade found in most Marriott Courtyards. The shower was large enough for a small orgy but was the same level as the bathroom floor so there was water spillage outside the shower and into the room. There are touches throughout the hotel to evoke a boutique and trendy feel, however most of it was done on the cheap. Overall, it feels like an old building with a dimestore makeover. Laminated cork floors show wear after only four years, chipped paint, pealing wallpaper, dim lighting to hide the flaws. Mattresses feel old but are covered with a nice featherbed and decent linens. Staff was good at providing restaurant and nightlife recommendations and went out of their way to do so. Midtown Location is good on W. 44th street between 5th and 6th Aves.

First off, I must admit that I am terribly fussy, so you may wish to consider that when reading this review. I traveled extensively and have been to New York several times. I love the feel of a smaller property and realize the amenities will not be as extensive as in a larger property i.e. swimming pool, spa, etc. Had a king room with a bath. Nice decor, the daybed is a really nice touch. The room was cozy, which is typical of New York. Not a great deal of room to maneuver, which I suppose is the product of the king size bed. Storage is at a minimum, which came into play with the winter clothing. Room is nicely equipped; \u2022dvd/cd player, \u2022IPOD audio system (at least in the room I was in), \u2022large bathroom. I'd give the \"Television cleverly hidden behind mirrors\" a miss if possible because the glare from the lamps makes viewing virtually impossible. Like noted in other reviews, the common areas and rooms are looking a little worn; \u2022cork flooring with big gouges from dropped items, \u2022tiles peeling off ceiling and elevator, \u2022wall paper peeling off the walls These are minor irritations at best, but they do diminish the overall look and feel of the property. However, the real problem was the service. Staff seemed to be far more interested in posing rather than being of any real service. Upon check in, there was no one to greet us, and no bellman to be found. Taxi driver helped with our luggage in the rain. Front desk really couldn't be bothered explaining the features of the property. Limited knowledge of restaurants in the city, always seemed the person I spoke to had to \"ask someone else\" for information. Best of all, on our final day when we were trying to flag a taxi down, which was extremely difficult because of the rain. Finally the doorman from the hotel next door grabbed an umbrella and helped us, while our bellman (no real doorman at the City Club) stood inside and watched the whole thing ! Guess he didn't feel the need to get his ultra cool City Club toque wet. Overall the hotel is okay; great location, and the restaurant, DB Bistro Moderne is excellent. Generally speaking what usually sets smaller properties apart is the personalized service, and it just wasn't there. This is made all too glaringly obvious because there are essentially 4 other hotels right next door. Next time, I'll give the Sofitel a try !", "Date": "December 30, 2005"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "City Club Hotel", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g60763-d224226-Reviews-City_Club_Hotel-New_York_City_New_York.html", "Price": "$239 - $709*", "Address": "<address class=\"addressReset\"> <span rel=\"v:address\"> <span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">55 West 44th Street</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:locality\">New York City</span>, <span property=\"v:region\">NY</span> <span property=\"v:postal-code\">10036</span></span> </span> </span> </address>", "HotelID": "2514725", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/ProviderThumbnails/dirs/8b/fd/8bfd7a18a0cc83434aca90702b5c89e51large.jpg"}}
