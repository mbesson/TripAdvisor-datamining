Public areas are all accessible as is the entrance, no steps. Rooms have small showers and WC (if severely disabled you you need to take a pace in and out but is flat) but suites have a bathtub. I have stayed in Barcelona four times over last ten years and decided to try a more central hotel and the relatively new Olivia Plaza is an excellent contemporary modern hotel in the best location for exploring all Barcelona's top tourist attractions located on the Plaza Catalunya situated at the top of Ramblas. Transfer from the airport couldn't be easier as the accessible A2 airport bus with ramp picks you up outside terminal and drops you off on Plaza Cataluya which is few steps from hotel for 5 euros and takes about 25 minutes. Additionally since our last visit 5 years ago all the buses are accessible with ramps to take you to all the sights further afield such as Parc Guell for 2 euros, fraction of price of tourist bus. The hotel outside terrace is lovely to have a relaxing drink in the evening or enjoy dinner. The staff are all very friendly and helpful and enhanced our stay and made us feel most welcome and nothing was too much trouble. Recommend room on higher floor at rear with views over Barcelona towards sea or at front with views over Plaza.

Staff were very professional and answered queries quickly, booked us on tours, and were very pleasant too...definitely do the Full Day All Barcelona Highlights Tour, which covered key Gaudi points, fast track entry into Sagrada Familia, and takes you to 'Spanish Town' at the end. Dined at the restaurant on the first day for a late lunch, and had roasted veg starter (which was excellent and I'm a carnivore), grilled squid which was brilliant too. Also dined at TA #1 restaurant Montiel which was amazing too (separate worthy review) Also visit the Bouqueria food market on the weekend....had tapas there but also a table behind us had their handbag stolen so do be cautious about pickpockets (older thief too I was told). I would recommend buying those discreet pouches that fit under your clothes well.

The bed was very comfortable, and the room had all the amenities you would expect. One minor point is that the carpet was a little strange, made of a material that clearly showed mrks of bags being wheeled across it - I would question how they keep it clean. There is also very little storage space in the rooms, if you were to stay at the hotel for more than 2-3 nights, you would struggle with hanging and storage space for clothing.

This was the perfect location to be in the city. Right at the main metro stop and right on Placa Catalunya at the intersection of several fabulous neighborhoods. Easy to get to work on the metro, then to shopping and restaurants in the evenings. I had a room facing the Placa, and I would have thought it would be noisy, but it was very quiet and the black-out blinds make it nice and dark for sleeping. The mattress was an American sized King (nice!) but was a little firm, still, pretty dang good for a European bed! Some people complained about the flooring being marked, up but I didn't mind it. It was clean. Customer service is not exactly the same in BCN as it is at home in the states, yet we were pleasantly surprised to find excellent customer service at the Olivia Plaza... from the front desk to the wait staff in the restaurant (remembering our favorite drinks :). Even the doorman was always friendly. Only complaint: the wifi is really weak in the rooms and there are no LAN connections for internet. Also, they don't use a WEP key you can enter once and have your device remember... it makes to route to a web page to log in EVERY time you want to access the wifi... total pain! So basically, I had to be in the lobby to access a connection. Since my smart phone only uses wifi while I'm out of my home country, this was a huge pain for me. Also, I didn't really want to be conducting work in the lobby. If this had been a better experience, I would have given the Olivia Plaza a rating of excellent. I suggest taking the AeroBus from the airport.. only 5,30 euro (at the time) each way and it stops about 200ft from the hotel entrance! Bus was clean and comfortable with plenty of room for luggage.

The perfect central location to La Rambla Street; the street where everything happens in Barcelona. We reserved 2 rooms for our party. 3 in a suite and 2 in a balcony superior room. When we arrived we received an upgrade to another suite. As an ultra modern hotel, there is no swimming pool or fitness area. A little disappointing as we were with our family and wanted to swim at night. Many of the other hotels nearby and throughout the popular districts have rooftop pools. The most weird part of the room was the lighting and switches. The lighting was 99.9% halogen with one fluorescent table lamp. As with previous reviewer comments, the light switch either turned the halogens on full or off. Nothing in-between. Also, some rooms had a separate light switch but it was wired incorrectly and turned on other rooms. After playing with the switches a couple of times, they would get overheated and stop working. You would have to take out the central room key from the electrical slot and replace it to reset the switches. Since there were no night lights and it was completely dark at night, we used the fluorescent lamp in the bathroom as a night light. Housekeeping was very attentive and fast. We called to have the pull-out bed made up since it wasn't done when we returned after dinner. Literally within seconds there was a knock on the door. The only other recommendation is to either bring ear plugs if you want a direct view of the plaza. At night it is quite loud with activities going on after midnight. We were also there during a local holiday, so there were also fireworks going on as well. There is a motorized shade to block out the sun into the room. The button is on both sides of the bed. That was pretty cool. Take the double decker bus for a tour of Barcelona. It runs all day and night and you can pick it up from the plaza. There are 3 different bus lines all for the one price, and you can get on and off as many times as you want during the day. Well worth the price. We didn't eat at the restaurant, and read from previous posts that the breakfast was expensive. We ate on La Rambla which happened to be just as expensive. Look for restaurants that offer buffets for breakfast. It's much more affordable than ordering off the menu...It's pretty much ala-carte dining in European cities. Dining Tip: In Barcelona they charge for water (bottled only - no pitcher or free refills), coffee is per cup, and each piece of bread at the table. Even if they serve the bread, if you eat it, you pay. If you don't eat it, you don't pay. Very strange from U.S. customs. We were a table of 5, we each ate 2 pieces of bread and were charged 21 euros ($32.00 US) just for bread...the charge for water was another 12 euros...OUCH! And finally, don't take a taxi to and from the airport if you are staying at this hotel, or one on the plaza. There are special buses, that accommodate luggage, which run from the plaza to both terminals of the airport. You can't beat 6 eruos each way and it runs from 6:30am to late at night.

We opted not to have the breakfast, a bit pricey for us but it looked pleniful and varied. The front desk was very helpful with maps and tips on sight seeing, and the location was excellent. We caught a bus from the airport that dropped us off right by the hotel in the Plaza for 5E. Buses and the entrance to the subway are across the street with an information booth in the subway entrance.

Firstly we arrived early, around 11am, and as expected we were too early to check in which was fair enough.

After going around on the bus and lunch at hard rock cafe next door we came back and the receptionist had changed. No worries surely this receptionist will see the notes the last one made about our room specification? nope, we were given a room on the 1st floor overlooking the courtyard. I would usually complain but at this point I didn't have it in me. The room was big, but maybe too big. There was a big empty space between the bed and sofa which is great if you have a family of four who can pull out the sofa, but for a couple it was just odd. The TV was also in an impractical location and almost impossible to watch from the bed (see photo). I agree with past reviews and the lighting system, the lights are just too bright and should have a dimmer switch. Criticisms over, the bathroom area was lovely with rainhead shower and overall the air con was efficient and surprisingly the view from the room was quite nice with a rustic view to the classic spanish buildings around. Breakfast was included in the price and there was a nice selection of hot and cold items. Always seats available and was nice to eat in the conservatory each morning. This hotel seems to cater to a lot of business travellers and americans and at one point over breakfast I did overhear an american not too best pleased with the view from thier room. It seems as though a few rooms look straight onto a wall so would stay away from these. Checking out was no problem however we ordered a taxi through reception for the port but they ended up booking one for the airport! I would recommend this hotel but definately pay the extra for a room overlooking the plaza as these make more use of the space.

RUDE!! Oh, and these locals have NO dress sense - they are very challenged with what looks good on their plump bodies. Oh and one more (just to nail the coffin) - the teenagers have been taught no manners. Unfortunately, there were a bunch of them on our departing flight to which I watched (just after the hostesses had gone through & shut all the overhead compartments) one of the boys reach up to the over head compartment from his seat, throw two backpacks in & then remain seated as opposed to standing up & placing the backpacks in & then closing the compartments...he not only made the hostess come all the way back to close it but he also put those at risk of having luggage fall on their heads.

The Olivia Plaza was a dream stay. From the moment we checked-in Reception staff greeted us with friendly smiles and bilingual accents. Their English was very well spoken and we never had a problem with translation. Nowhere in Barcelona did we have an issue. The Hotel was beautiful inside! We checked-in and immediately went to our room and by the time we got there, the Staff had left a personal note from the Manager welcoming our stay. I has speechless on the superb effort that was put in by Olivia Plaza. We had a Superior Room on the 8th floor (10th by US standards) that over looked the Plaza J After figuring out how to turn the lights on (slide key card into light switch LOL) a few moments later Reception called to check to be sure everything was to our liking\u2026 OF COURSE it was fantastic!!! The room was very spacious with a beautiful view of the Plaza. Adequate space for clothing (although no dressers, open shelving was provided instead) and a two seat table set was given for viewing the Plaza or my impromptu desk for wifi access. The bathroom was had gorgeous frosted glass windows incasing it including the shower doors and toilet doors. Beware if you traveling with someone you are not comfortable with sharing this type of space with. You can see the outline of the person showering or bathing and there are no locks on the doors. Didn\u2019t bother me and my husband one bit. LOCATION LOCATION! Hard Rock Caf\u00e9 is next door and the start to La Ramblas is right on the corner. We walked many a times down that way for dinner, the market, shopping etc. Down the other side of the hotel is another main street that will lead you to more shopping and the Barcelona Cathedral where we enjoyed many of breakfast and lunch outings. Being in the Plaza de Catalunya gives you great access to metro, transit buses, sightseeing buses and taxis galore. I suggest doing the two day hop-on-hop-off bus tours, well worth the money to really see the entire city near and far. We had to check out early 4 AM Reception scheduled a taxi to pick us up. As always the reception was incredibly helpful. After a 30 minute ride to the Airport and $45 euro\u2019s we made it the Airport perfectly. If you have the opportunity, I suggest taking the Aerobus that picks up and drops off at the Airport with several stops in town\u2026 it was only $5 euro\u2019s per person J we would have done it for the trip back home, but it didn\u2019t begin service until 6:30 AM.

On the last night and day there was no water pressure. I got in the shower and suddenly the water turned brown. My husband called the front desk and they told him they knew about the problem. HELLO! If you knew the water was turning brown, shouldn't you warn your guests? 2.) One very very rude receptionist (she was so bad that she outweighed the others that were fairly nice/polite). I asked her if she could help me find the phone number for my airline because they lost my bag. She told me \"no\". Two days later, I was sitting in the lobby and heard her helping another guest who had lost his bag. She called 5 offices of that airline for this guy and kept telling him how it was her job to help and she was happy to do it. Ok...so I guess his money was more valuable at the hotel than mine. He didn't look like anyone important...so I wasn't sure what her deal was. I didn't ask her to call anyone...just to look up a number for me (and she was just standing there doing nothing when I asked her). 3.) The walls are thin in the hotel. We could hear other guests doing things (use your imagination)! 4.) Although convinient for sightseeing, all the restaurants within a 10 minute walking radius of the hotel seemed like tourist traps.

They went on to say that the only option was to use the hotels laundry service (\u00a34 per shirt for ironing) The room was also uncomfortably hot as the air con was set at 20'c. Every time we tried to turn it down, it went straight back up to 20'. When querying this with reception they said it was the law that rooms could not be lower than 20'c for 'environmental reasons' and that it was the goverment to blame. As we had an internal room overlooking the lobby rather than a window with view outside, they offered to open our only window which looked down onto the lobby (previously locked with no handle) In doing this cooled the room slightly, however sleep was still interrupted with noise from the lobby and bar below, so no better off. Drilling and noisy building works in the room next door at 8am on out 1st morning also quashed any chances of a relaxing lie in.

It runs every 15-30 minutes. So worth it! Taxi is 30 euros! As for the hotel the rooms were huge and free internet in the rooms.

Step out of the hotel and turn left and you are right on Las Ramblas. A metro stop is directly opposite which is extemely convenient and cheap, as is the stop for the airport bus and open topped tour bus. The hotel itself was very nicely decorated, clean and comfotable (bed was very comfortable!) Also breakfast was good with lots of choice and certainly sets you up for the day. I got ot a very good deal via yeego.com the price for this hotel being almost half of what was quoted by other companies making it a bargain in my opinion (but perhaps because this was January?). Only slight negatives I would mention are:- the shower and toilet share a glass door (i.e. when the toilet door is closed the shower door is open) however not a problem for us as we were a family sharing the room. Also the size of the room was a little on the small side especially we we opened up the sofa bed for our son to sleep on, it was a real squeeze, but again not really a problem and expected in Europe.

The toilet was an enclosed space accessible by a laminated glass door which when closed still showed the person's entire profile sitting in the toilet from outside..not very pleasant. Shower was also a small enclosed space which made you a bit claustrofobic..also accessible by a laminated glass door. Bed was king sized and very comfy. Our room on the 3rd floor overlooked the atrium and the restaurant on the ground floor. Quite noisy at night which made it hard to fall asleep. Didn't have breakfast as it was not included.

Service-wise, the doorman and bellboy were great and always had a smile on their face. However, the check-in counter staff, while helpful and efficient, didn't seem to emit the same level of friendliness. We obtained rates at 40% off through a travel deal website and obtained rooms at 99EUR per night which was a great deal considering the location and star rating of the hotel. I don't think the value is there if you were to pay the regular room rates (179-200EUR) as the rooms were small and didn't give me the impression that the furnishings or designs were of the highest quality. Carpet flooring would have been preferred as oppose to the vinyl woven-textured flooring by the bed area as we noticed permanent red marks on the floor. The common areas however were fantastic, beautiful, modern, and we would have only wished that the rooms were of the same quality and feel. We faced the courtyard on the 3rd floor which was quiet and nice, but I would have preferred a room looking over the plaza.

Location - The first thing I have to say about it is that I don't think that there could be a better location to stay in Barcelona. It was perfectly situated on the Plaza de Catalunya. The Aerobus (from Barcelona airport) stops at the Plaza de Catalunya and there are also stops for the Bus Turistic (the sightseeing bus with three different routes that travels around Barcelona - would definately recommend!!!!!), as well as plenty of places to eat and drink. Cleanliness - The cleanliness of the hotel was perfect, can't be faulted in any way. Rooms - We had a room overlooking the atrium, there was outside noise from the atrium but not so much as to bother us at all. However, we had a window which overlooked the lifts and therefore had to keep the curtains closed all the time otherwise everybody could see straight in. The rooms were modern, flat screen television (although only Spanish channels), minibar, comfortable double bed. The bathroom area was spacious. Toilet cubicle very small though! Also, take care when having a shower because there is a two inch gap between the door and the floor and very easy to flood the room! Service - The staff were brilliant! Reception staff helpful and attentive. One of the doormen, don't remember his name, was extremely helpful, always suggesting things for us to do and go and see and where there was free entry. Only negative thing I would say is that, sometimes we wanted to go back to the room for an hour in the afternoon to freshen up and relax and the room still hadn't been made up, sometimes not until after 3 or 4pm. I would recommend this hotel, but perhaps request a room overlooking the Plaza de Catalunya. With regard to Barcelona itself, the Bus Turistic was the perfect way to travel around the city and see the main sights. Also, if you get chance, there is a tram and funicular railway up to Tibidabo and we would definately recommend going up. The views were fantastic!

It was my second time in Barcelona, so I had a good idea of where I wanted us to stay. First of all, getting there from the El Prat airport was almost too easy: just ask where you can take the bus that takes you right to Pla\u00e7a Catalunya. I believe the ride was 5 euros a person, so have some cash ready. A short while later we were getting off the bus and crossing the street to our hotel. Upon walking in we were greeted by only smiles and polite people. The bellhop helped us with our luggage to the room and gave us a little tour. We were on the 8th floor with views to the courtyard. I was hoping for street views, but I was actually very well pleased with the views that we got over the city roofs to the beach. I can't say how happy we were with the workers at the hotel with one exception (I'll get to that). To give some examples, we brought cava back to the hotel to drink in the courtyard which I then spilled all over the place; the bartender heard and rushed with towels to clean it up and extra ones for us. Also, the bellhop who was patient enough to let me practice my Catalan with him and give us the 411 on attending the Camp Nou for a match (I got tips on that too, if you want them). Everybody tried their best to answer our questions and were very helpful. My only complaint was that the cleaning ladies could get pretty loud outside our room when we wanted to sleep in. That only happened a couple times, though. As far as the room goes, we were very pleased with it. We got a triple, which included a sofa-bed that we sometimes used to watch tv. It was all very clean and neat. The layout of the room was unique and had a very efficient use of space. We loved the shower, although you can't leave the door open with the shower head running, or it could spill out of the shower. No bath tub, but we didn't miss it. There were some imperfections with the construction of the room, but you had to look pretty closely to find them, and they didn't really affect us at all. I will say that the lights took some practice to figure out what each button did. I did love, however, that I could raise the blinds with the push of a button in the morning without getting out of bed. One thing that did bug us, however, was the wifi connection which was very weak. They should do something about that. As far as the location goes, well you really can't beat it as a tourist. Las Ramblas is literally around the corner and Passeig de Gracia is across the plaza; those two streets have very different feels, so each night we could easily decide which feel we wanted for our dinner. The buses and metro are also so close that you'll feel spoiled. If you want to do some grocery shopping to save on meals, go to the bottom level of El Corte Ingles, which is also on the plaza, and eat on the plaza or take it back to the nice lounge in the hotel on the 2nd level. And for the Americans that get really homesick, there's a Burger King and a McDonalds also on the plaza. We found it perfect for grabbing something before heading to Bar\u00e7a match.

Get a room at the front for a great view of the square out front (although they can be noisy), as the rooms at the back have no view and you will have to keep the blinds closed since some of the windows face the lifts. You wont be sleeping early anyhow, the city is buzzing at midnight. Rooms dont have door latches so watch out for housekeeping bursting in at 8am despite your do not disturb signs. Walls are pretty thin and the a/c turns off if you take your key out of the power socket which is annoying (but the blinds go down automatically which is great).

On arriving at the x hotel, the reception was clean and a bright eyed French receptionist greeted me and took my reservation. I was given an interior facing room, spacious and fully and stylishly furnished. However I was in and out of meetings at the conference and had to work during the day from my room. Although the rooms are adequacy lit, I preferred some more natural light. Most people stay in the rooms during the night only... So I asked down at reception and was fortunate to ask after check out time about room allocations. Rebecca again quickly looked up for a room change and suggested some rooms on different floors. Luckily there was space and I was moved. I think maybe business reservations are moved to the interior to keep noise from the street down, which is sensible really. Having gone to other cities a bad night can kill any chance of feeling awake during a 4 hour next day meeting. The hotel is located near to bars, restaurants and central shopping areas. Most of which are totally touristy. I took a look around and didn't find anything. Caf\u00e9 Zurich is nice, but the serving staff there is a bit curt. I went back to the hotel and Rebecca, who knew me quite well by then, told me what the hotel was serving for lunch. So I ate at the hotel restaurant.

Let me start with the good: This hotel is located centrally along Placa Catalunya. This is an excellent location for getting around Barcelona; and is around the corner from Las Ramblas. The hotel is located across the street from the beginning of the Hop On Hop Off bus routes. The Tourist Information Center is also located across from this hotel, underground. Olivia Hotel offers a wonderful buffet breakfast with a wide array of breakfast food. The cost of the breakfast is 20 Euros. The NOT so good: When my travel companion and I arrived we were assigned to room 701. We left the hotel for about half hour and upon our return we found our room flooded. It appeared that the flood was caused by water seeping up from the floor. When the hotel was advised of this their response was very laissez faire. When we booked the room we requested a room with 2 separate beds. We were informed that if we wanted another room with 2 separate beds, we would be reassigned to room 301; or we could have room 702, next door, without separate beds. These were the two options given to us to correct this situation. When we went to room 301, the stench coming from this room was overwhelming; it smelled like raw sewage. The hotel is aware of this condition, however, as stated previously -laissez faire. This was unacceptable to us as a result we took room 702. Each evening for approximately an hour the stench that we smelled in room 301 would envelop our room then go away. The way the rooms are set up does not lend itself to privacy. The sink, toilet and shower are really part of the greater room. There is a recessed mirrored partition that you can pull out of the recess to block the sink from the sleeping area. This offers a modicum of privacy while bathing, toileting, etc. The toilet and shower are along the same wall and share a sliding glass door. If you pull the glass door one way it covers the toilet. Pull the other way and it covers the shower. Due to the layout of the toilet, there isn\u2019t a sufficient barrier between the sound and odors (sorry, no delicate way of putting this) of the bathroom and the sleeping area. Lastly, luke cold water from the shower. The water from the sink is hot but the water in the shower is not. When we asked about this their response was \u201cthis is hot.\u201d Again, remember laissez faire. I wore a hat the entire time I was in Barcelona because the water in the shower was too cold to wash my hair; and my head could not fit under the sink facet.

Reception was very friendly (Irene) although the first indication of what was to come appeared when she was unable to contact anyone from housekeeping to find out if the room was ready. The rooms look great but are fairly impractical, one single sliding door for shower and toilet may seem like an original design but is just plain annoying. The wash hand basin is positioned just inside the door, there is no bathroom as such, and the whole entrance area gets wet with even the slightest usage. The beds are strangely uncomfortable but I couldn't figure out what was really wrong despite waking up several time to try to find out. The lighting is irritating in that most of the switches seem to bathe the room in virtual daylight. There didn't seem to be the possibility to have just enough light to get to the toilet for example. The hotel wasn't noisy but I could clearly hear conversations from other rooms (I'm sure I could have joined in!). There was no water one night and a call to reception provided no indication as to how long the situation would last or even the slightest apology for the inconvenience. Housekeeping was quite random, towels left in the shower, as instructed, to be changed were exactly as we had left them upon our return. Other supplies were not replenished. Breakfast was OK but the coffee shop next door provided all we needed considerably more cheaply.

Barcelona is a wonderful city, with loads to see, taste and places to relax and get a good tan in! the olivia plaza made the city an even better stay (and having an ice cream shop next door helped too!)", "Date": "July 22, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "New England", "Title": "\u201cNice Hotel, SUPER location\u201d", "Author": "Gitano", "ReviewID": "UR17924734", "Content": "The best possible location.

El Corte Ingles department store also has a grocery store in the basement that serves sandwiches, etc. We packed a picnic and headed to the beach.

The hotel is on this square, about 100 meters from the bus stop. Check in was very fast, the receptionist being exceptionally friendly, & we were given a map of the city.

It also had a flat screen tv with lots of choice, efficient air conditioning & in room safe. The blinds were electronically controlled ! Would happily have stayed here on a longer break. Made the most of our short time in the city. No more than 2 minutes away is Las Ramblas. Also, if you turn right outside of the hotel, then right again, this takes you into the Gothic quarter. I noticed the city tour buses also departed from the airport bus stop. Coming back into the hotel late that night, there was a security guard on the main door. We had a very peaceful night. Couldnt hear a thing from outside or within. Bed was very comfy. Didnt eat in the hotel, but had a light breakfast & superb coffee at Cafe Zurich, also on the square. We were given an hours extension to our check out time, so we could explore a bit more. For those needing to get to the cruise terminal, I would suggest a taxi.

The room itself was spacious, contemporary and very unique. I found no problem with the glass panelling that seperates the bathroom from the bedroom as the glass is so thick you cannot see through it. On arrival at Barcelona Airport do get the Aerobus which stops just outside the Airport to the left, it's about 4 euros and so easy, about four stops to Catalunya Plaza and takes around 25 mins depending on traffic. The best thing about the Hotel is its location, it cannot be beaton and you'd never get lost. All the tourist buses, Aerobus, taxes, Las Ramblas and Gothic Quarter all on your doorstep! This was our first visit to Barcelona and while I personally wouldn't rate it the best european city, the people were very friendly and the food and wines were to die for. We were recommended some very nice restaurants by Alex on reception and being seafood lovers we were not dissappointed. One of our favourite restaurants was Taller de Tapas in the Gothic Quarter with an open kitchen and everything cooked fresh. Las Ramblas is quite safe, just be careful with your belongings, loads of street entertainment especially at the weekend and a small market on a Saturday. For good coffee and drinks head to Cafe Zurich opposite the Hotel, this place was always our final stop before heading back to the Hotel.

Though the rooms are a bit pricey compared to American hotels, nothing else compared to the chic, modern design of the rooms and lobby. Upon arrival, I was greeted by two fluent English-speaking workers who immediately took my luggage and gave me their full attention. My sister had not arrived yet, as we came from different destinations, but they let me check in at nine a.m. anyway though the hotel was nearly completely booked it being new years. The rooms looked exactly the way they did in the photos, and I was intrigued by the unique open design of the bathroom. It made the room look much more spacious and luxurious. The outdoor terrace downstairs is amazing and has a glass floor and heaters\u2014a perfect place to relax in the night. The Internet room is also elegant\u2014with two computers with free Internet. Plus, the location is nearly perfect--right at the beginning of La Rambla, near the Barri Gotic and within easy walking distance of Paseo de Gracia, an upscale shopping district. Overall, the highlight of my stay in Barcelona was Olivia Plaza. I admit, at times I just wanted to lie in the comfortable bed and watch tv instead of going out. Moreover, on our fourth night we were upgraded for no extra charge to a larger room with a great central view of Catalunya Plaza. I love this hotel and the staff I became friendly with.

Very srong hydrogen sulphide smell...We got up fairly early and left for the day...we brought a spanish speaking friend back to the hotel who also requested soap and we finally got some!!!...As we were only staying till the following morning and the smell had dissapeared so we stayed put. When we checked out and mentioned the smell we were told it \"was nothing to do with them\". Also on the first night the bar closed at 12!!!! (Barcelona???) and we could't get a drink to bring to our room as \"the till switches off at 12\"!!! We returned 4 nights later and all was relativley ok. (Toileteries included!!) Another observation is that the air conditioning vent in the bathroom is not connected to anything...you can see the void space between the floors!! Overall not impressed and will not be back....", "Date": "September 22, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "3", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "3", "Check in / front desk": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "New York", "Title": "\u201cVery Disappointed\u201d", "Author": "ny10019", "ReviewID": "UR8828708", "Content": "I must say that as a frequent business traveler and someone who stays in hotels more than 250 nights per year, my experience at the Olivia Plaza was incredibly disappointing. As I mentioned, I am constantly on the road for business reasons, however this past August while on business travel in Europe, I decided to stay an additional week in Barcelona as a vacation. I came across the Olivia Plaza website and thought that this hotel was exactly my style with the clean and modern finishings. It was more expensive than other hotels I looked at but I was willing to pay the extra money since I loved the design. When I got to my room my initial impression is that it looked great. But then I looking around I noticed that their were all sorts of deficiencies with the quality of work. The bathroom enclosure was entirely made of glass (a detail which I thought was nice). However when opening the sliding glass door, you needed to use both hands and force it open. Then within the bathroom there was a 2nd set of doors for the shower and commode. When opening these doors, the glass door was so poorly hinged that it made a really loud noise and sounded like the glass could shatter. The glass bathroom walls that met up with the sheetrock were not finished properly and you could see all the raw materials behind it. I could go on and on. I was amazed that a hotel developer could allow such a poor quality of work, but it didn't initially bother me so much since I didn't own it. That was until my girlfriend got stuck in the bathroom and we literally had to force the door open. The sliding door was completely de-hinged and would no longer move. We went to the reception and notified them of this. They sent someone up to fix it. This fix lasted until the next day when the same thing happened. Once again I went to the reception and complained. They advised me that nobody was onsite that could fix this until the next day. She then told me that I should be able to fix it myself and it shouldn't be that difficult. When I told her that she could give it a try if she wished, she just gave me a dirty look. She then said asked if we could live with it for a couple of days. Since we could barely squeeze into the bathroom I told her this wasn't an option. She then said she only had two rooms available. One was a downgrade on a lower floor (causing me to lose my view). The other was an upgrade which she said would have cost an additional 60 Euros/day. I have been in many hotels and have never in my life been asked to pay for an upgrade due to a deficient room. I tried to explain to her that it was unfair for me to be downgraded since it was not my fault and that she should give me something as good or better. Unfortunately there was no convincing her and I was forced to take the other room. This room had similar issues, however at least the door opened. On my last night in Barcelona I was having dinner at a restaurant when I noticed that someone had stolen my bag (which contained my wallet and all my credit cards). I immediately found a phone and canceled my cards. The next morning I went to the front desk and told them what had happened. I received no sympathy from any of the hotel staff. The response I received from the lady at the reception was \"Well you could have waited a day before canceling your cards\". I was amazed. She then told me that she would not let me leave the hotel without payment. Was she going to keep me hostage? Fortunately I was able to convince the manager to trust me to wire him the funds (which of course I did immediately when I got home). I would not recommend this hotel to anyone. Although I still think that the designer did a great job planning the space, I'm sure he is not very happy with the end results.

All rooms are very clean and housekeeping is excellent. Sitting outside on the hotel bar terrace, was amazing. It was hard to believe that only meters away were the busy streets of Barcelona! On the negative side, the rooms are not soundproofed, as we discovered at 2:30 on our first night. One phone call to reception and within 5 minutes, someone was there to move our bags to an upgraded room on the 9th floor.

The location is great (Aerobus stop, Metro stop, right in the city center...) and the rate we paid was ok as it is advertised (and deserves to be) a 4 star- we could have got something less expensive of course, but you usually pay for what you get, especially in a big city. The hotel decor is a bit weird at first - but it really is something different and grows on you. We were given one double room for two people and the other half of our party was given a family room or even small suite (?) as it had a huge sofabed as well as a bath and separate shower. Unfortunately the previous guests had smoked in the double room, even though the hotel is a non smoking facility. So we complained at the front desk and received a different room immediately. We did not have any problems with 'privacy' either in the bathroom or shower as some reviews had mentioned! We did hear guests next door talking & laughing very late one night but we also got home late the next night - Barcelona is a city that never sleeps! Other than that no noise problems. The breakfast buffet was very nice; fresh fruit, juice, cereal, eggs etc. and everything was always quickly replenished. We never had to use the Metro or public bus; only went on the tourist doubledecker which was great! Would not recommend eating on Las Ramblas or Placa Real as very expensive and not good food. Actually we had a few difficulties finding nice & inexpensive restaurants - one time we were even refused service because we did not order 'enough' food for 5 people!
