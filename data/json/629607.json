{"Reviews": [{"Content": "The Perfect resort Stayed at Kuta Puri for the first time last year, and have re-booked for 5 weeks this year. Have been travelling to bali for the past 10 years and only discovered this Hideaway last year. and I am so glad I did. Spent 4 weeks there last year, I found the staff friendly, service was always prompt and being in the heart of Poppies I thought we might have some problem with the noise, but once you walked through the main entrance you were in paradise. I would highly recommend this place if you are not really into the big resorts, and like the intimacy of a small and comfortable resort. Can't wait till we return.", "Date": "Jan 2, 2009", "ReviewID": "UR778027486", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "lewisSydneyAustralia"}, {"Content": "Nice but noisy       Kuta Puri Bungalows money changer", "Date": "Sep 19, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR259766100", "Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "2", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "Cindylovestravel"}, {"Content": "Our Garden of Eden My family has just returned from beautiful Bali and we had the best time ever!! Kuta Puri Bungalows is our Garden of Eden.  The place itself is set in magnificant lush gardens, which are tended daily by five friendly gardeners who work tirelessly to ensure that there is not a blade of grass or a flower out of place.We were a party of 8, and stayed in both standard and deluxe rooms, which were more than adequate. Clean sheets every single day, and the lovely cleaning staff even put flowers in and around the room from time to time. All of the staff are so friendly and polite, especially the restaurant staff and the bar staff, who take the time to learn your names and chat to you.  We came to Kuta Puri to celebrate our silver wedding anniversary. The restaurant manager, Suastika arranged the most memorable day for us, beginning with a ceremony to renew our vows, followed by the most delicious feast and fantastic entertainment in the form of the beautiful balinese dancers, complete with musicians, and a singer/guitarist. We couldnt have chosen a nicer place to hold our celebrations. Everything was perfect!!!Kuta Puri is definitely MOST RECOMMENDED. It is heaven on earth!!", "Date": "Jun 29, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR301737076", "Ratings": {"Service": "-1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "-1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "5", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "-1", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "luckyluckygirl"}, {"Content": "pretty lovely kuta puri's location is excellent. despite being so near to the beach  all the hustle bustle around, it 's really quiet  peaceful within the compound of the hotel. besides a spacious garden, it has added an additional pool recently, so it wouldn't feel so crowded. rooms are generally clean. 8 more deluxe rooms will be ready probably by next month. i really can't tell the difference between the standard  deluxe rooms, the standard  balinese bungalows. they look the same to me except the choice of colours  a little of the decor. i remember being shown a year ago a deluxe room which is now considered a standard room. though they insisted i must be mistaken. the present deluxe rooms are newly built but still no difference from the standard rooms. infact, the bathroom offers no privacy. i can hear distinctively what's happening in the 2 bathrooms beside mine, i can also smell the cigarette smoke if my neighbours are smoking in their bathrooms. i've stayed in their standard, deluxe and balinese bungalow before. balinese bungalow of course affords the most privacy but it actually has the most mosquitoes. booking directly through the hotel is more expensive than asiarooms, but u'll get a better room. i suspect they reserve the oldest standard rooms for those booked through asiarooms.breakfast is lousy. not worth waking up for. service isn't consistent. the very first time i stayed at the hotel, i got a welcome drink but my subsequent stay had nonebut overall, for the spaciousness of the compound  the quietness within  the excellent location  the cleanliness, it has gained my loyalty.", "Date": "Jun 15, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR313878472", "Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Business service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "3", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "nabunay"}, {"Content": "Loved it!
