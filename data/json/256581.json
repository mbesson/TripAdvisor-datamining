I only hope their customer service executive sees this and appreciates the outstanding job his staff did for us. Obviously, we wouldn't suggest this would be everyone's experience, but here goes. We had reserved the room for a Tuesday night (after a cruise) through wotif.com, a discount hotel website that sometimes has discounts (you have to keep checking). Since rooms in Sydney are generally pricey, this single room (it is an apartment-hotel) was about $175 and through wotif included late check-out and a bottle of wine. However, we arrived at 9 a.m. and check-in wasn't until 1 or 2 p.m. So I smilingly asked the desk clerk if we could check in early instead of out late. Without blinking an eye, she looked at her list and told us that we couldn't get into our reserved room early. However, they had a 2 bedroom, 2 bath unit that she would be glad to upgrade us to for the night. Huh? Just like that. We retrieved a luggage cart, piled on our 3-weeks worth of stuff, and went up to our \"apartment\". I really don't know what this would have cost, but if you needed a place for a family, this was perfect. Master bedroom (king bed) with ensuite full bath (large), second bedroom with 2 twins and full bath outside. Complete kitchen, including dishwasher. Living/dining area with sofa, coffee table, flat screen, dining table and chairs. Separate flat screen in master (although mounted up near ceiling for some reason). Oh, and a washer and dryer in the second bathroom. No charge, except for soap (bring your own). Clean, with furniture in good shape. Only caveat is that showers are over bathtubs, and bathtubs are quite a climb into. Big step. Quiet room. Hotel is in a busy area, but didn't hear any noise. Was about a $20 taxi ride from whart. Going to the international airport the next morning, the hotel arranged a shuttle at $14 per person, and the shuttle was right on time and took about 15 minutes. Lots of shops and restaurants in the area, which is Haymarket. We had been to Sydney before, so we walked around Chinatown (about 5-10 minutes) and surrounding areas. The hotel is also about 5-10 minutes from the central bus depot, and there is a free shuttle that goes around the Central Business District (CBD). Just be sure to get on the shuttle across the street from the terminal and look for the green 555 sign. Did not eat at the hotel, but plenty of places around. The staff were extermely courteous, and there seemed to be lots of business people there.

The pool downstairs looked great although we didn't find time to use it. There are plenty of places just around the corner to buy basic bread, milk and groceries and Chinatown is a 5 minute walk away with more supermarkets and bottle shops and Market City for fresh fruit. I do have a real issue however with Medina continuing to charge $25 a day for internet use,. Its about time in Australia we started offering this as a service in all properties. there is a Gloria Jeans across the road where you can access the net for the price of a cup of coffee.

There were 3 of us ... 2 adults plus a 3 year old child. Arriving to check in at 10pm, we were provided with an upgrade to a loft apartment. We were extremely happy with our apartment. My priorities are cleanliness and safety. The bathroom, kitchen and apartment in general were very clean. No problems with swipe cards to access lift and room. We're pretty tidy when travelling, but the apartment was cleaned regularly, including the bathroom being wiped down daily ... A cleaner even unloaded our dishwasher, even though this wasn't an expectation. We were very fortunate to have a small balcony that faced north. Being able to sit outside and enjoy the city was great. Despite being noisy whilst sitting on the balcony (not a problem, we're in the middle of the city after all!), the apartment was very quiet when the balcony doors were shut. Also nice to open the balcony doors to let in a breeze to cool the room. The loft next to us had a similar balcony with access but no view as the fascade of the building ran the length of the balcony, which rendered the balcony useless if you wanted to sit outside. Still able to open doors for a cooling breeze. Consider this when making a loft booking. I made use of the washing machine ... It was clean and seemed in excellent condition. I also used the dishwasher, and was clean and working. I didn't make use of the oven or stove. We used the airconditioning quite a bit to cool the loft. Both the vents upstairs and downstairs worked effectively. It's a large space to cool, but keeping the blinds and curtains shut helped and we were most comfortable. Some of the scrim curtaining was ripped, obviously by the handle of the balcony door. A little care by previous patrons would have prevented this. We pulled and tied back the curtains and had no problems. I wasn't fussed by the torn curtaining. Can't expect it to be replaced everytime a patron is careless and damages them. Of course, I would expect them to be replaced when they get pass the point of return. Stairs in our loft were a little steep, but my three year old (who has poor vision) made use of the ballustrading well, and was confidently using the stairs. I agree with zzNov314 ... \"Best advice, go all the way here and get a room not at the lower end and you'll see the best it has to offer which is, actually rather good\". Being an old building that has been converted within the constraints of the original wall structures means that some of the rooms may be pokey. Overall, we had an excellent trip. Full kitchen was an asset when travelling as a family. Position to Central Station was great, especially considering we travelled on the XPT and Indian Pacific, and also made use of the light tram and local train services whilst in Sydney. Lots of places to eat at from cheap and cheerful to restaurants. It was nice to stay in an 100 year old building with a bit of character than a skyscraper type building. We were fortunate and appreciative of the room upgrade.

The bathroom boasted a deep bath with a shower over it and also housed a washing machine and drier concealed behind a well positioned door. Considering the hotel is situated on a busy street and adjacent to Central Station I was very pleased the rooms were so quiet. I suppose on the down side, the windows didn't open, however, the rooms remained very quiet with some lovely city views at night (Sorry, couldn't see the harbour from here). As others have mentioned, the location is fabulous. Public transport is abundant with light rail, bus, monorail and trains available virtually from the front door. Having said that I chose to walk the 300 metres or so to the Sydney Entertainment Centre which is opposite Paddy's Market and around the corner from the infamous China Town. There are plenty of Asian restaurants to chose from with a variety of supermarkets and seafood and fresh food markets close by if you feel more adventurous and want to try cooking up a storm in your apartment. Unfortunately I did not use the inviting pool, gym, sauna or BBQ area, but was pleased to hear that the Medina Executive payed special attention to their guests and provided fresh towels, toiletaries and BBQ Plates and utensils for their guest's convenience. It's these little touches that I appreciate when staying in a hotel like the Medina Executive.

The foyer internet was not working and there was no sign to indicate this, we had to find alternative at the Wake up hotel as staff did not have a clue where to send us. There a few facilities in the hotel, i.e. bar or in house restaurant although there are facilities to use a nice barbeque around the pool area. Nobody helped with suitcases in fact there was only one person running the whole reception when we arrived, he was friendly and polite but unable to help with luggage etc.", "Date": "May 24, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Austalia", "Title": "\u201cGood for families - but don't get the loft\u201d", "Author": "GfamilyAustalia", "ReviewID": "UR64189539", "Content": "We have stayed at this hotel 2 or 3 times in the last few years with young kids and always found it excellent.

The problem was that the sofa bed (which the kids shared) sagged so badly that they kept rolling on top of each other and fighting. The air conditioning was also so lound it made the wall rattle (we seemed to be right next to the main cooling tower). The other major concern was that the banister on the top floor loft room was extremely easy for the 3 year old to climb and we had many dramas trying to stop her climbing up and falling down to the ground floor. I really think if the hotel is going to make this room available to children they need to change the banister to make it impossible for a small child to climb up and over it.

Through a friend of mine who had business relations with the hotel, I got us an extremely good rate the first stay (Feb 09). My friend told me beforehand that the rooms are big and much better than the hotel I had originally planned on staying at, which was right across the street. The premium one-bedroom apartment I booked at the Medina was HUGE!! The biggest \"standard room\" I had ever stayed in, apartment or other types of hotels. The living room had enough sofa and chair seating for 9 people!! The location was great and despite a lot of traffic and actions happening at its doorstep, the room was nicely quiet, soothing and comfortable - exactly what we needed on a busy, hot summer day upon arrival. It's a heritage building from colonial time, with excellent natural lighting. It had so many windows that I couldn't help but smile every time I walked in the living room. The layers of curtains also control the natural light. I found everything I needed in the kitchen, even a stove, an oven and a dishwasher. The bathroom was spacious and elegantly appointed, the wash and drier was nicely tucked away. Yes, the furnitures are not brand new, but they passed my extreme pickiness and my wife's expensive taste (and she worked in a hotel for years). The bedroom itself was of a good size too - not much smaller than a standard room I found in some budget hotels, and offered a decent view. I enjoyed the hotel so much that we came back 3-month later. I emailed the hotel and told them I got a great deal last time and they repeated the offer. The rate was slightly higher due to it being a higher season and I upgraded to a one-bedroom loft apartment, but the price was still fantastic. All the facilities and amenities were there. The room was great as usual. But I must say that the loft apartment I got was not neccesarily better than the one-bedroom apartment I got before. The privacy of the bedroom/loft from the living area was not as great, the lounge area was smaller (still very spacious and comfortable, but I wouldn't call it huge in capital letters), bathroom was of a standard size - not as big as before. The balcony was not great. We had late check-out on both occasions (not morning persons) and left our luggage for the friendly and polite reception desk to look after for hours and hours. On the second stay, we left things behind in the closet and had to go back. To our relief, the hotel staff had collected them and put them in a nice bag for us. To sum it all up - overall best hotel experience I have ever had and great value. It is so good to go back to a spacious room after an eventful day. Feels almost like home. The TVs could have been bigger, but at least we had two in each apartment.

Check out time was 10am, but they extended that by one hour for me and also stored my bags for several hours as well. The hotel also had a small but nice outdoor pool. The fitness facility was located in a small room and only had a treadmill, cycling machine and a few free weights. The location is relatively safe and located fairly close to Chinatown (5 min) and Darling Harbour (10 min). A walk to Circular Quay and the Opera house would take about 20 minutes.

While it will not have breathtaking views of the harbour, you will have a great location for everything else. The rooms themselves are quite open and spacious. One quirk is the bathrooms which you literally step up into (about 1/2 inch/1cm)) which at first causes a bunch of stubbed toes. After two days, you know the drill and don't think about it. The kitchen we had was spacious and the treats located int he fridge and elsewhere were not ridiculously expensive. Television had a limited number of channels (and in our room had two adult channels that were unlocked...not that we were watching them, but when flipping channels for little eyes...just make sure you change quickly!) I will warn you about the hotel's Internet. It is VERY pricey. Uploading pics and normal activities cost me well over $150AU for the entire week. I could have easily bought a broadband card and service for much less. If you are coming for any length of time, buy a broadband wireless card. There are very few open hotspots around the hotel. The hotel is located next to the station, but it is a bit of a walk to the train platforms. If you have kids or large luggage, I would suggest not taking AirportLink unless you feel comfortable walking several blocks. Rush hour is quite busy, so if you are doing any traveling do it early or late. Weekends and holidays are quite dead, so you will get around quite easily on the weekends. There are a host of student hostels and backpackers around Central, but the hotel security does a great job of keeping the place quiet and secure. There are a number of small shops and restaurants surrounding the hotel. There are at least five convenience stores open 24x7 within one block, no problems getting a Slurpee at 01:00. Central IS a train station, and the majority of its clients are business-folk, so don't expect a tourist haven here. You will get good service, but don't be surprised if you are surrounded by suits or business types looking at you strange with your \"I HEART SYDNEY\" shirt while waiting for a latte.

You can also walk underneath the street taking advantage of the tunnels located next to the hotel. Overall the hotel is a great value, and I would definitely stay there again.

When we pointed out that the room they'd tried to assign us at check in (2 male business colleagues) was a \"double\" not a \"twin\" the check in staff made a rude & unhelpful suggestion that we share. Rather than cause a (deserved) scene, we said we'd check in later in the day when other rooms were free & asked to ensure the room or bedding was changed.

Even thought the hotel knew we were on honeymoon, we didn't get any compliments like a bottle of wine or a card like some other hotels provided. The room on the fourth floor was absolutely immaculate. You walked into a kitchen with a spacious lounge with a sofa and TV, and on the other side was a bathroom with a bath/shower and cupboard with washing machine and dryer. Opposite that was the bedroom which had a huge wardrobe and a TV. Could not fault the appartment in any way. However, there were some problems from our 5 night stay which I'd like to highlight. 1) We had a lot of valuable property and therefore we would have liked to have used the safe which was allocated in our room. However, every time we tried to use it, it wouldn't work due to the battery being low. We contacted reception who were extremely friendly and polite and sent a message through to the handyman for him to change the battery. A day passed and no new battery. We asked at reception again and was assured that the handyman would change the battery for us immediately.... two days passed and still no new battery in the safe!!! 2) Washing power, charged at $2.50 for two small packets. We needed to do some more washing at the end of our trip, and as we had run out of washing powder, I left a note for the cleaner to leave us a new packet. Wasn't done. Next morning I caught her in the corridor and asked her about it, she said that I needed to ask at reception, she didn't use her own initiative to phone reception herself when she first read my note. So we asked at reception and was assured that washing powder would be sent up to the room immediately........... dum dee dum ...... hours later, no washing powder!!!! I went back down to reception and asked where the washing powder was, almost begging him for washing powder as we were leaving the appartment in the morning and needed time to wash and dry the clothes. He once again spoke to the porter on the phone asking him to do it ... when we came back we finally had some washing powder, it was like a miracle had happened! But why should we have to ask about four or five times almost to demanding point for things to be done at the hotel???? In the end I was up until way past midnight trying to dry clothes off because of the laziness of the staff. Next thing: we had someone else's bill come through our door. We went to reception to explain that the bill had been delivered to us by mistake and that we are not room 50, but room 60. The guy on reception apologised and then crossed off 50 on the bill and put 60 instead! We kept saying to him \"But this is not our bill! It was put under our door by mistake!\", but he apologised and said he didn't understand and asked for us to speak to someone else at reception! The TV channels: on our bedroom tv, there were two porographic sex channels which had no warning or restrictions on them. Children could very easily have access and view them, so BE CAREFUL!!!!!!!!!!!! Overall, would I stay there again?
