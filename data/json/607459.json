{"Reviews": [{"Content": "An Oasis in Beijing We just returned from Beijing, having spent 9 nights for the Olympics at Somerset ZhongGuanCun in the Haidian district. What a great place! An easy walk to Carrefour (supermarket) or the subway line. The daily breakfast lounge was great, and the pool and gym were an oasis after a long hot day outdoors. As a family of 4, we stayed in a 2-bedroom, 2-bath apartment, and had far more room than what a typical hotel could offer.Our apartment had central air conditioning with individual temperature controls in each room. Everything was very clean. Marble floors, marble counters and brand new fixtures. Everything worked as it should. The daily maid service was very efficient, and we never lacked a thing. When we needed something, the staff was very helpful. We'd definitely stay there again.", "Date": "Sep 2, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR110260033", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "Fuzzydog7760"}], "HotelInfo": {"HotelURL": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g294212-d607459-r19687870-Somerset_ZhongGuanCun-Beijing.html", "HotelID": "607459", "Price": "$140"}}
