My family stayed for two nights. The staff was great..... the room was huge... and accommodating, with a kitchette. Beautiful clean room, furniture.....and bedding. The wellness and Spa area was really nice.... clean and relaxing.Negative, the hotel is very tall and narrow, the elevators were always going in the wrong direction, and the staff neglected to mention that you have to use your swipe card. We had to change our room cards 3 times because they stopped working. No breakfast. And the path to the wellness center passes automated doors to the outside, for the business from outside, but, its not so great when your in a bathrobe, winter time!", "Date": "Apr 28, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR388205328", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "TorontoTraveller38"}, {"Content": "Great Hotel with outstanding service We spent only one night at Lindner Main Plaza, but it was a wonderfulexpierence. Huge rooms, more like suites with seperated living and sleeping area - huge bathroom with a tub and marble floors. The room was clean as a whistle and the the view is really amazing through the big windows over the city (window can be opened). Room service for breakfast is awesome and arrives on time. The breakfast was greatand worth the money. The only little drawback is that the mini bar isway overprized (Mini Water bottle 3.00 EURO) but there is a free water bottle in the room and a little grocery store right around the corner. We arrived by train and followed the directions on the linder. de website and it was only a 3 minute walk from the s-bahn station Lokalbahnhof. Very convenient. Also only a short walk througha park to get to the Zeil. We did not eat at the hotel restaurant but nearby (in the Colosseum) at an Indian Restaurant (MONSUN) right around the corner from the hotel entrance. Outstanding food!!! The next morning we used the Wellness area, which is included in the room price. There is a pool and lots of different Sauna's. Also a fitness room, which we didn't use. We also enjoyed the massage at theBeauty and Spa downstairs. Great expierence and they do have last minute prices (about 2/3 of the normal price for a massage). Overall it was enjoyment pure and we will defenately stay in this hotel again - the next time longer then one night.", "Date": "Oct 8, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR735357611", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "5", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "michellec_26"}, {"Content": "Great views, greater wellness area! It's a great place to stay. Admittedly it's over the other side of the river and not that close to the financial district but then again it's only 10 minutes by taxi or 5-6 minutes by \u9225\u697d-Bahn\u9225?plus a 7-8 minute walk to the station.The best about the place is the unusually shaped rooms. I stayed there 3 times altogether and each time it was grand. Rooms are huge and some are equipped with a little kitchenette. The only thing I disliked is that there\u9225\u6a9a no free Internet / WLAN. That should be included these days, especially, if you're paying close to rack rates. Round the corner you even find a supermarket open \u9225\u69afill 10PM that also sells organic stuff, not too bad for a 2 minute walk away!The wellness area is also great: try the pool for a sunset \u9225?it's fab. There additionally is a sauna, steam room and a sanarium!For those jogging fans: just outside the hotel along the Rhine\u9225\u6a9a riverbank you can go about it to your hearts content!Brilliant place and entirely recommended!", "Date": "Sep 28, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR596156549", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "5", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "London-Travella"}, {"Content": "100% Recommend !

They had them in the reception and they said that as they could read only my first name they could not deliver them.Nice excuse but with the software they use (fidelio ) they can trace any room number by using only the first( or partial ) name.The same night a goup of ten people(after a long day at work ) the hotel we went to Harrys New York bar and it took them 45 minutes to prepare some sandwiches while the ones who ordered burgers had to wait 1 hour and fifteen minutes (as they call delivery from the city).I really think that the managment should care more about the service and that bad location (it's not in the center ) in combination with bad service is a terrible mix If you have to stay there try the Italian restaurant that is next to the hotel ( The Biancanali ) if you want to have a tasty dinner and service that respects you as a guest.", "Date": "Sep 30, 2006", "ReviewID": "UR885634095", "Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "1", "Overall": "2", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "2"}, "Author": "Haris N Neofitidis"}, {"Content": "Incredible room Spent a night in the Lindner Hotel during a recent business trip.The hotel is located a little outside the city center (15min by taxi) directly on the river Main.Rooms are in an old tower, some of them seem to be apartments for long-term stays.The room was one of the best I have ever had.
