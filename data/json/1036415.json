This time however, we were extremely disappointed!!!!!!! Firstly the larger of the two swimming pools was closed after the first few days, half of the hotel rooms were being closed and sold off. Secondly, we went to Vegas for a few days, and on return, we found our two rooms had been flooded from a DIFFERENT rooms toilet!!!!! The rooms stank and the staff did not even tell us or think to check the rooms, even though they informed us that a total of 9 adjacent rooms had been flooded out!!!! On moving to the \"new\" rooms, one of the doors was broke and only needed the application of pressure to \"unlock\" the door. So yet another room switch!!! We went out, and returned to find that the door frame had been cracked, presumably by someone trying to break in whilst we were out. There were lots of weirdo's around, confrontational and often staring at you. The hotel seems to attract the wrong crowd as the rooms were quite cheap. Every night we had people banging at the doors, shouting and arguing. There appeared to be a room occupied by some individuals who were \"up to no good\". The remaining swimming pool was not heated, often the pool towels were dirty or you had to ask to get one. The best two things about this hotel? The maintenance guy who was very friendly and helpful. And the distance to Raising Canes (fast food chain).", "Date": "January 14, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Sleep Quality": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "not available", "Title": "\u201cI am a teacher and my experience is the worse ever.\u201d", "Author": "saundra f", "ReviewID": "UR120357688", "Content": "I found pubic hair on the bed and the room next door had a weiro outside the door.

And to the west is the Metro Mall with 2 of 5 anchor's vacant. When I've gone past this location in the past, the sign said \"$29,\" today it is $33. PLUS they want another $5 for WiFi. But after I found out that the closest Motel 6 was $35 and the Best Western would not honor their coupon for $44, I decided to stay. The motel 'still' looks like a 1st class motel, I say still because often a motel in this price range buy a good motel cheap and let it go down hill fast. So far that doesn't seem to be the case for this motel. Pool area was well kept, as was the grass and parking lot. No complaints on the room either. But no extra perks either. Bed, table, TV, room was clean, water was hot, room was warm. Great choices of food across the street, Burger King, Olive Garden and Four Points by Sheraton. If I stay here again will depend on if I need Wi-Fi that night or not.

Upstairs room I had for a week was awesome! Fox News too! BUt the big sign outside says 'Free Wifi in Lobby'. THERE IS NO WIFI IN THE lobby (NONE) but only one small terminal like computer on the wall. So if you want any wifi you pay $5/day which is fine as the rooms are only $30 ish. But that is blatantly false advertising! NO WIFI at all in the lobby. One other complaint. I stayed 7 nites and almost every nite the NO smoking rooms on both sides of me had smokers in them that SMOKED in the room. After complaining 3 times they talked to the one guy. Why do smokers insist on non-smoking rooms and then smoke in them??? Pretty quiet hotel and definately would stay again.

Each time it kept getting worse. On my second visit, someone backed into my car and damaged the front bumper. Not a quiet hotel at all. One visit I had the entire team of the AAA baseball team; San Diego Padres staying in the room above me! They were so rowdy that the screws in the light above the table was backing out and drywall dust was falling onto the floor. I called the front office and she said that she would speak with their coach. I checked out the next morning, so who knows if that happened. The only reason I ever stayed here is because they accept big dogs. They do not however, have any kind of grass for your pet to use. I had to go almost to the highway so my dog could get some kind of natural ground, instead of asphalt or cement. The area where this place is located has really gone down hill. If you stay here, lock everything! Walk in groups and hide any kind of valuable in your car. The price really isn't that great if you take into consideration the area and the undesirables that stay there.
