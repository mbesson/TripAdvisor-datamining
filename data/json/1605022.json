The dinner was ok, but was told on the website there would be chicken, no chicken. The adult drinks were so watered down you couldn't even taste the alcohol . According to the website, this hotel had an indoor pool, (one reason why we chose this hotel) and when we got there, it was partly inclosed. The water was freezing. Kids were running and splashing and staff would walk by and not do a thing. The breakfast was ok. Some food was just not good at all. Also the oj was warm. Also when we wanted to watch tv, all the stations were staticy. The beds were comfortable, and the front desk staff was great.

I booked here because of the other Tripadvisor positive reviews and concur that is it very good value for the money. A newer property which is nice, and as such flat screens and wi-fi. The free local calls and 1 hr of LD calls per night also handy. Each night they have a \"Kickback\" event so free sift drinks, liquor and food in the same area where the free beakfasts are. Quite well done as nachos, hotdogs, mac & cheese, veggies, so hard to argue as it is free. A bit more variety would be good, but I wouldn't recommend eating there each night, so serves the intended purpose. Exercise area fairly small & basic, and pool on the small side too, so if you & your kids really want that than this may not be a good fit. We stayed at the Drury 5 nights, then did 2 nights at the Arizona Grand Resort so the latter fulfilled our desire to have some awesome pool/waterslide time. Staff accomodating, and eventhough property filed to the brim with baseball players & their families I thought they did a good job keeping on top of the breakfasts and housecleaning. Area by check in desk with 2 computers and a common printer so that is always nice. Location wise, easy access off the 101, but truly it is very North of Phoenix (on border of Happy Valley), so if you want to be central not ideal. Nice mall 1 exit north (can access via street so don't need to get back on the highway), and also Applebees & many other restaurants to pick from. Rooms quite spacious. We had the suite, so 1 bedroom with 2 queen beds 7 flat screen TV, and another main area with a pull-out coach and it's own TV which is a bonus. Fridge in our room a bonus & bathrooms did the trick too as newer & quite clean. Nice to get a USA Today & breakfasts more than sufficient, and again free, so overall we were all quite pleased.

This hotel was the most reasonable priced. And a great location. Just one exit up the 17 from the hotel had every restaurant and department store you could need. It was very convenient and stress free staying here. The hotel was well maintained with a classy lobby and professional staff. We stayed in a suite that had a living room at the entrance with a flat screen Tv and a couch that was also a pull out bed. The bathroom and kitchen area was in the middle. Kitchen included a sink, mini fridge and microwave. It was enough to get by for left overs. The far end room was the bedroom with another flat screen TV and very comfy bed. The kitchen area and bathroom was all tile floor and a perfect area for our blue French Bulldog. The bedroom end of the kitchen had a door we could close and we put a puppy exercise pen at the other entrance to the kitchen to create a accident safe area for the dog when we left for the day.(see picture) It was a nice room with a great set up for dogs. The pool was half indoor and half outdoor. Not the worlds largest pool but big enough to have fun splashing around. The spa was on the inside half. The pool was heated but only to high 70's I would guess. It was a little chilly getting it but once in the water, the temperature didn't bother me. The outside half of the pool had a few tables and chairs but really not a large area. It was okay as long as you don't expect a vegas style pool. The Hot breakfast yummy. Included sausage, eggs, waffle maker, bisque and gravy cereal ... ect A little bit better than your average Holiday Inn Express hot breakfast. The afternoon kickback had alot more food than I expected. There was salad, chips, nacho sauce, Meat to throw on the nachos, Hot dogs, Baked potato's and condiments, Vegetable and 3 free alcoholic drinks. The drinks were beer, wine, generic cosmo and margarita mixes. All this and they also include all day long complimentary soda drinks and popcorn. The hotel offers a lot of bang for the buck.

It smelled like a casino and there was no way we could stay with my husband and daughter having a headache from traveling all day, me being very sensitive to smells and my other daughter had a cold. The front desk clerk had offered to spray something in the room but had no idea of how long it would take to work. We inquired about other hotels in the area but she said they were all full. We decided to leave and drive the 2 hour trip home in the middle of the night. What an inconvenience! My family was in the hotel business for forty years, and I have a feeling I know what happened. Someone else checked into the smoking room that did not have a non-smoking room reserved. After they complained, the front desk staff decided to rent our room to them and let the night auditor deal with us when we arrived much later. Why didn't the housekeeping staff try to get the room smelling better during the day or anyone else once they realized they would have to place a non-smoking reservation in a smoking room? I left my contact information and asked for the general manager to call us but never heard from her. I think this property is poorly managed. Before leaving I used the restroom off the lobby.

The location is on the northern edge of Phoenix just past the loop road (101). Its close to a junction of Highway 17, so easy to find, and is about 25 mins from the airport by car. Although it's a large hotel, it is a limited service model - so there's no restaurant or bar (except 5.50-7PM, see below). There's nowhere to eat or drink in walking distance so you would need to drive somewhere. However, they do have a guest pantry if you need to buy snacks, microwave meals, drinks etc) Now for the freebies - Free wi-fi: Good cover, both in the communal areas and our room, with very good speeds - fast enough to stream video. Breakfast was included with the room rate and there was plenty of it and plenty of choice. Free booze! - At 5.30 every evening they have what they call Kickback - which is basically free food & drinks for an hour and a half. Each guest gets 3 free drinks(choice of wine, beer or cocktails), and there's a good choice of hot and cold snacks - enough to make a light/mid size evening meal. Great if you're jet lagged and just want a few drinks and something to eat before crashing out. Free calls - an hour of free long distance (not int'l) a day. Pool: apparently there is one, but we didn't look for it. Tourist tip: About ten minutes away is the Deer Valley Rock Art Center, where you can see native American rock art covering 2-3000 years. Well worth an look if you have time.

We ate there, and were immediately sorry. The breakfast is the same quality. You get what you pay for. The pool was the biggest disappointment. It was small, and absolutely freezing. There was no-one in the pool - no other families. It was so cold that we had to take our three year old to swim in the hot tub for 5 minutes at a time. And the stench of chlorine was overwhelming. The adjacent \"fitness center\" contains only cardio - one bike and three treadmills. No weights or even a ball. This is a business hotel - for a business traveller that wants to eat junk food for dinner. I could hardly mask my disappointment when I checked in. The first thing I did in my room was get online and book another hotel. We ended up going to the Tapatio Cliffs Resort, which I could have booked in advance at $169, but ended up costing us $204 per day for the rest of our stay.

For those of you interested in details, here is the long review: This is the first vacation my wife and I have taken with our four year-old son. When he was younger we would vacation without him because he did not travel well (don\u2019t worry, we left him with responsible grandparents). This year we felt he was old enough to try to travel with him so we went somewhere close. We live in Las Vegas and decided to go to Phoenix. We thought about staying at an expensive resort like when we travel without him, but thought it would be wasted on him. Thus, we decided to spend a week at Wet-N-Wild and looked for a hotel close to the water park. Tripadvisor led us to Drury, which turned out to be a great choice. With all the great amenities and the low price of the rooms, I wonder how this hotel chain stays in business. We stayed for five nights (July 5-9, 2010). On the first day we got to the hotel about 45 minutes before the 3:00 p.m. check-in time. Rick at the front desk was more than helpful and got us the room we had reserved, the oversized one bedroom suite (see pictures). We went to Wet-N-Wild after we checked in until it closed at about 6:00 p.m. After changing into dry clothes we went to the evening light snack which is included for free with the price of your room. However, this is way more than a light snack. My wife, who is a picky eater, thought the food was great (I\u2019ll eat anything). They were serving hot dogs, Chinese vegetable egg rolls, buffalo wings, Idaho baked potatoes and assorted chips and salad. While it may not taste very good if you are a gourmand, it tasted great to my family and me. Even my son, who is also a picky eater, ate enough to fill him up. Oh, did I mention that the evening food comes with free alcohol? Three free drinks per adult staying in the room. The hotel not only had beer and wine but also mixed drinks. As stated above, we booked the oversized one bedroom suite. It\u2019s more than big enough for our family. The only drawback is the one bathroom in the suite can only be accessed through the bedroom. Thus, if you have someone sleeping on the fold-out couch in the living room portion of the suite and they have to use the bathroom, they have to go through the bedroom. The kitchen area is huge, probably too large to be using the space effectively. I\u2019m not an architect, but I wonder if they could\u2019ve made the kitchen smaller and somehow provided access to the bathroom through both the bedroom and living area or kitchen. I tried to find faults with this hotel but had trouble doing so; free internet, free breakfast and a large, clean hotel room. If I have to find any fault on the first day of our stay, it\u2019s that the Cajun trail mix served at the nightly snack was stale. That\u2019s a pretty small problem, however. This is how friendly the staff is: the nightly snack and breakfast is a self-serve set-up. After you eat, you throw your paper plates and such away. However, the staff working the food area, if they were not doing anything else, would ask how everything was and clean up anything you had finished. The service was better than some four and five star hotels at which I\u2019ve stayed. The only real fault (Cajun trail mix aside lol) I can find with the hotel is the workout facility, which is small. It has five cardio machines to use but nothing else. The cardio machines are in good shape (three treadmills, one bike and one cross-trainer). Working out may not be important to all travelers, but I\u2019m a workout addict and had limited ability to work out during my vacation. As a recommendation (if anybody from the hotel reads this), perhaps they could make an arrangement with a nearby gym (if one exists) to allow hotel guests to work out. Breakfast is just as good as the evening snack. Waffles, French toast, donuts, sausage eggs, biscuits and gravy, bagels, muffins, cereal, fruit coffee, tea, hot chocolate and juice. There is something for everyone. My son was very disappointed that there were no donuts the second morning of our stay (they ran out). However, they were back the third morning and for the rest of our stay. We spent each day at Wet \u2018N Wild and our room was always clean upon our return. Even though we did not use all of the hotel supplied shampoo and soap, housekeeping left new soap and shampoo so there was always at least one sealed item in addition to the one being used. The evening snack (okay, from now on I\u2019m just calling it dinner) on the second day had the baked potatoes and hot dogs again but also meatballs (which were a little dry) and chicken strips (which were fantastic). I didn\u2019t really want the Cajun trail mix again but wanted to taste some of it to see if it was still stale. Apparently, they opened a new bag because it was no longer stale. These items were rotated every other night with the first night food items, with baked potatoes and hot dogs provided every night. In summary, this is one of the best hotels I\u2019ve ever stayed at. The staff was extremely friendly and the facilities (except for the workout room) are the best. Rick at the front desk told me they are opening up another Phoenix location closer to downtown in Tempe. The only other recommendation I can think of for this hotel, and this is really being greedy, is to have desert (ice cream, cookies or whatever) with the evening food. Being on vacation and forgetting our diets, we went out for sweets every night after eating at the hotel. Regardless of whether the hotel adds desert to its menu, I\u2019m still planning on going back, as it\u2019s a great value. Side Trip Recommendation 1: Go to Sweet Republic in Scottsdale for ice cream after dinner. It\u2019s a place I read about on the internet before our vacation that has fresh made ice cream and sorbet. It\u2019s quite a drive from the hotel, about 20-25 miles, but it was well worth it. It\u2019s some of the freshest ice cream I\u2019ve ever had\u2026and my wife also loved the oatmeal chocolate chip cookie they had. Side Trip Recommendation 2: The last night we were at the hotel we went to dinner with some friends that live in Phoenix. Go to Paradise Bakery, which is just about 1 mile north of the hotel in the Dick\u2019s Sporting Goods shopping center and movie theater. My wife and I always go to this chain restaurant when we are in Phoenix, as they aren\u2019t yet in Las Vegas. The food is great and their cookies are to die for! Side Trip Recommendation 3: This is the perfect hotel to stay at if you are going to Wet N\u2019 Wild. If you go to the water park just twice, it is cheaper to buy a season pass. This is what we did. In fact, we had so much fun, we are planning to go back (and stay at the Drury Hotel again) in August.", "Date": "July 20, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Chicago, Illinois", "Title": "\u201cWould definitely stay again!\u201d", "Author": "mmjkfamily", "ReviewID": "UR71406328", "Content": "Our family loved this hotel!

We definitely enjoyed the free evening drinks and appetizers as well as the delicious free hot breakfast! The staff members were incredibly courteous and helpful to every single youth and adult in our group. We had a number of special requests: a 2 hour early check-in for 7-8 of the rooms, hot breakfast items earlier than the usual 7am, use of the dining area for late night pizza party, and a myriad of different room billing requests . They were able to honor each request graciously and never once made us feel that we might be asking too much. One morning we got back to the hotel after an 8am game, arriving 5 minutes before breakfast was ending. The general manager, Tim, was making the rounds in the breakfast area greeting guests and clearing plates from tables. He made a point to ask the boys about their game and then encouraged them to fill their plates, assuring them that more food was on the way. When I sought him out to thank him personally for our stay, he greeted me by name, asked me about our stay, and assured me that it was his pleasure to be able to serve us well.

LOCATION: The hotel is located in northern Phoenix, which seemed to be a very nice part of the city. It is right off of the interstate, and the hotel has great access to both I-17 and Loop 101 (a freeway) providing easy access to downtown Phoenix, Scottsdale, and Mesa (our destinations). Unfortunately there is no dining in the immediate area of the hotel, although a nice strip mall/shopping area/restaurants are only about 3-4 minutes north by car. It seemed the hotel was located alongside corporate office buildings and apartment complexes. ROOMS: Our rooms were well furnished and well above expectations for a \"moderate\" hotel chain. The hotel itself is brand new, and as such everything in the room was spotless. Great flat screen LCD television with HD channels, refrigerator, microwave, tiled bathroom floor, comfortable beds and pillows, and southwestern decor all made the room very enjoyable. The only two complaints I had were 1) the air conditioning is very touchy and is either off or blasts air, and 2) the toilet is a unique water-conserving model that I was not familiar with. HOTEL AMENITIES: The combination indoor/outdoor pool is small, but functional. The whirlpool was decent size and although the parking area was full with guests, the pool area was never crowded. The real advantage to staying at this hotel is the free breakfast and evening reception area. Unlike the previous Drury I have stayed at, this hotel has a large area devoted to the free food and drinks. The free buffet-style breakfasts were outstanding. Scrambled eggs, sausage, biscuits & gravy, and french toast were just some of the offerings on top of the normal continental breakfast foods one would normally find. The free \"5:30 Kickback\" offerings in the evening seemed to be less impressive, although it was fulfilling enough that we didn't have to go out for dinner some nights. The bartender was superb (surprisingly) and remembered everone's drinks when they would come back to the bar. It should be noted that each guest over 21 years old gets three complimentary alcoholic drinks per evening (wine, beer, and/or basic mixed drinks). The free soft drinks were always available, even though the information in the rooms specified they were only offered from 3pm-10pm...that sure beats having to pay the normal $2 or so for a drink out of the vending machines at most hotels. The hotel even offered free popcorn to snack on in the front lobby. For the late night munchies, the hotel has a small vending area offering frozen pizzas, TV dinners, ice cream, and such for very reasonable prices (usually less than $2 for any one item). STAFF: The hotel staff was all extremely friendly, although seemingly overworked. It seemed at times they had one person running the place in the evening, and there was a slight wait to speak to the front desk person. That being said, I watched as the managers checked on everyone during the meal times and even offered to get some of the elder guests their drinks at the bar! All the staff seemed more than ready to help with directions in the area, general Phoenix information, and special requests. In closing, I would highly recommend this hotel for anyone seeking to travel to the Phoenix area that wants a moderate hotel. Although it is more expensive than your \"cheap\" travel motels, I definitely felt like I got a great value out of my stay considering we had complimentary breakfasts, drinks, and even some dinners provided for us. We found that the various online travel websites offered prices that were better than the Drury Inn website (even using travel discounted rates like AAA).", "Date": "March 15, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "New Mexico", "Title": "\u201cFriendly Staff - Free Breakfast and Dinner\u201d", "Author": "Iggyboot", "ReviewID": "UR58593508", "Content": "We enjoyed our stay at Drury Inn, Phoenix this last weekend.
