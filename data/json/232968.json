{"Reviews": [{"Content": "Worth A Try - But My wife and I stayed here for one night after seeing the hotel a few weeks earlier during a visit to Florence. At 90 Euros for the night it was not the cheapest hotel in the city but it certainly was far from the dearest. We were impressed by the room and the bathroom on first siting but then discovered that there was no airconditioning. My enquiry at reception was met with that room does not have airconditioning but no offer to move us to a room that did. We have stayed in cheaper hotels in Florence that had airconditioning and I was staggered that in this day and age a hotel that charges 90 Euros a night has rooms that do not have aircon.The tariff included breakfast but it was a pretty ordinary offering. The hotel is quiet, very clean and well located. If we go back to Florence I would be happy to stay there again but only if we are provided with an airconditioned room. If booking I urge you to ensure that you are provided with an airconditioned room.", "Date": "Dec 12, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR132233208", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "3", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "Robboc"}, {"Content": "Value for Money Helpful staff - they speak good English,friendly but not pushy - professional.

It did the job of easing your hunger, but for \u62e2100 a night I expected more than this.My main criticism though was by far the coffee. Let me just say that almost any Italian would be ashamed of this. It was weak and tasteless. As anyone who has been to Italy before knows, the Italian coffee is outstanding and I was really looking forward to my morning coffee, it was such a dissapointment.LOCATIONIts excellent for getting to and from the train station, but the hotel is a fair distance from the main part of town (the old part), a 15-20 minute walk. This may not seem too much, but Florence is a hard city on your feet, there are so much tourists and the roads are so small and the very busy traffic mean that a 15 minute walk is a little tougher than usual.Also the part of the city is not somewhere where tourists should really be hanging out at night. Dont get me wrong, its not terrible, but its also not somewhere where you should let your guard down late at night.STAFFThe staff were very good up until the last day. My girlfriend had an accident where she knocked here head on a bathroom window, she ended up being taken to hospital by ambulance and having stitches. The guy at the reception was very good in getting the ambulance, but after we got back from the hospital he said we needed to leave the room immediately as new guests needed to check in. Seeing as my girlfriend had just lost a fair amount of blood and needed a lie down desperately (all of which he had see), I was not too pleased as you can imagine.OVERALLI have to say I cant put my finger on why I didnt like our room, it had everything, except a view, was clean and fairly comfortable beds, but I always had trouble sleeping there. Also there was a lot of noise outside our room and we were at the back of the hotel, the front is facing the main road to the station and was very noisy so the noise is probably an issue for most rooms.We paid \u62e2100 (Sterling) per night, and I thought for that price it was too much. Very average hotel and I wouldnt stay again. There are much better in the old part of town than this one.", "Date": "Sep 17, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR403142695", "Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "2", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "2"}, "Author": "SimonJGeorge"}, {"Content": "Wonderful boutique hotel!

When I arrived at the train station with two heavy suitcases, I was happy to see the location was truely only 5 minutes away by foot and the walk was really easy.There where three of us in our room... two adults and 18 year old daughter... so room size was important. Room #108 was our room and although it was a perfect size for two it also did the job for three. The high ceilings made the room feel more spacious. We had a balcony and a very large ensuite with a jacuzzi which I enjoyed after a long day of sight seeing. The hotel has recently been renovated so everything was very fresh and clean.

Great coffees, juices, rolls and croissants, cereals, cheese, cold cuts, selection of jams. A great start to the day. Location was easy access to the Duomo and the museums and for shopping. There are many restaurants around the hotel so one did not have to go far. We did not have a car so this location was important.On the side street there was a small grocery store which was convenient for getting bottled water which was a third of the price from the main core of the city.

There was barely room to move around the room with luggage in it, and the bathroom was small as well.

It's located very close to the train station (you can see it from the top of the steps outside the train station), making it very easy to walk there with our luggage (and saving cab trips). Although close to the train station, this meant it was a 10-15 minute walk to the Duomo and other sights. We liked the location a lot, but others might find it too far away. While sometimes neighborhoods around train stations can be less than ideal, this area seemed fine/safe to me, though maybe not as nice as areas closer to the main tourist sights.We arrived early (before noon) and they actually had our room ready - this was very nice considering we'd taken trains from the Rome airport and could use a break. I don't think rooms would always be ready that soon, but even if not, they would have let us store our luggage there until later.We had a double superior room - I don't know what more this had than the standard double, except for maybe a larger room and upgraded bath/shower. Our room (107) was spacious (even by US standards) and very clean. Looking at the fire escape floor plan, the rooms appeared to vary a great deal in size, and this looked like one of the bigger ones. Although we're often sensitive to noise, we noticed no problems with noise from outside or from adjacent rooms - we did hear noise from the hallway a couple of times, but with so few rooms per floor, this was very rare, and short-lived. Our room faced a side street, so maybe other rooms would be noisier?The bathroom had one of the coolest showers/bathtubs I've ever seen. It was a jacuzzi bathtub with a shower that had both an overhead (removable) sprayer and jets that would shoot from the side. It closed with an almost airtight seal - even with hot showers, it did not steam up the bathroom. The bedroom included a closet, an armoir (with electronic safe inside), a TV (didn't use), a minibar, etc. I don't remember there being a lot of tabletop space, though there were nightstands and I believe a desk. No alarm clock (I didn't encounter these anywhere in Italy - I wonder why?). The bed was very comfortable. The air conditioning worked well, although it seemed it might not stay on while we were out of the room (taking out the room key turned off all the lights, maybe all the power). The floor was hardwood, which probably helped explain why they could keep the room so clean.The staff was very helpful, and the person who checked us in was extremely friendly. There was an internet access terminal available in the lobby, but it listed charges. I assume this is mainly for people who use it for a while, since we used it once for ~10 minutes and they didn't charge us. We only ate one breakfast there (as we were running late for our train - nice to be so close to the station!), and it seemed fine: breads, cereals, juices, and ham and cheese.Overall, we loved the hotel, and had no complaints whatsoever.

The staff was very friendly to my children.Breakfast was very good. They had good coffee and tea, croissants, ham and cheese, yogurt, and an assortment of cereal and crackers. Orange and grapefruit juices were also available. The breakfast room was light and airy....classical music played softly in the background. The staff was very friendly and accommodating.The hotel is near the train station, but not right next to it. Just a couple of streets away. We never felt unsafe.

We were a tad off the beaten path in terms of sights, but since everything is within walking distance we never felt that we were too far away.

There is a small bakery/restaurant across the street and also a good pizza/pasta place down the block.We did use the travel agency next to the hotel. Some of the hotel people were working in it when I went in there to make train and museum reservations. (You have to have reservations to get into the Uffize, the Academmia, and a few other places.) I also dealt with the woman who works their regularly. Luisa was her name. She was very cordial and friendly to me. I had no problems.We would definitely stay there again. Another plus for us was our room had a small refrigerator. It was stocked with drinks (alcoholic and non-alcoholic) for you to purchase. We had put a bottle of our own water in the refrigerator and then the maid charged us for it. I politely told the desk that it was our bottle, and that we hadn't opened theirs. I said the cost was only 3 euros so I didn't want to make a big deal of it. He immediately thanked me for telling him and he said he would take it off our bill...which he did.There is Internet access at the hotel...a tad pricier than the Internet cafes around the corner.

The climate-control system worked very well. The English-speaking staff were very friendly and helpful (they even waited with straight faces as I tried out my poor Italian on them). The breakfast room and foods available were delightful. The one thing I might have wished for is a less-busy location; my room was located right over a busy intersection, and while the noise was minimal when the windows were closed, I couldn't open them for air without getting lots of noise and traffic fumes (I'm sure there are quieter rooms).

It is a walk of less than 5 minutes to the train station, and even less to the bus station. Although the location isnt the most picturesque, your are only around 5 minutes from the Il Duomo, and another 5 to the Uffizi. Everything in the hotel is small; the lobby, the elevator, the rooms, and their views. We did have a mix-up on our room request, but it was handled quickly and without fuss. It has a nice breakfast room with a nice, substantial breakfast selection. All of this is fine, but the one drawback that would give me pause in enthusiastically recommending it were the beds, which were hard. We joked that they were simply sheets over a piece of plywood. If this doesnt bother you (it didnt bother me much), this would be a good place to station yourself for travels through the region.
