There was an initial glitch- i tried to book online for 2 nights, they had a site problem, and booked me in for 3 nights at an entirely different time under the name of the previous booker!.However,this was speedily and efficiently corrected by their staff within 24hours, my credit card refunded, the correct amount charged and fees waived. So far,so good.As we were going in the week preceding Xmas,by train,and arriving Paris just after 0800, I contacted concierge service re leaving our bags early,until check-in- again prompt positive reply.On our arrival,we were delighted to be told we could check in immediately (0920!) so we in effect gained an extra hassle free morning in Paris. The room we got was superior,front facing,4th floor-- very good, but no way would I ever pay the advertised 425euro room rate. The room was super-heated, and opening the windows lets in a LOT of noise from the road outside,a one-way street leading immediately onto the Champs Elysees.However, for what we paid on the offer,we were extremely pleased with everything about the room. The breakfast is expensive at 25euro, if you have to pay,but was excellent- not just continental buffet, but bacon,eggs,sausages,omelettes to order, and the breakfast room staff- like everyone else in the hotel- were excellent. We live in SW France where customer service is at best variable,and were not expecting great service in the Capital,so it was a pleasant surprise.. The only disappointment was that the bar was closed- due to Xmas week?!--as we had hoped to just pop down for an easy evening drink without needing to go back out after walking around all day. The hotel is ideally situated for restaurants/cafes /bars etc, ans 30 seconds from a Metro station and 3 mins walk from the fantastic Xmas market on Champs Elysees. The leisure facilities were a little claustrophobic for me,being below ground an d heated to a high temperature, but seemed very good- I suffered about 2mins in the hamam!

Very clean, and the bathroom has nice toiletries. Minuses: The street it lies on (rue la Boetie) is narrow and congested, with little parking space while you're checking in, if you're coming by car (not such a concern if you're arriving by taxi or using the subway.) The extras like meals or coffee / drinks are over-priced so we avoided these. The room was over-heated and it was hard to adjust the temperature down, though we solved this by opening the window (in early December!) but then there was street and traffic noise as we overlooked la Boetie. The desk clerk charged E13 extra per day for the 2nd person (me), saying our company negotiated rate was for just one person (my wife) though the contract said nothing about extra charges and the hotel incurred no extra expenses (there was no complimentary breakfast, or extra bed or larger room involved.) Also, other desk staff said there was no charge but it ultimately appeared on the bill. Very strange.

I read reviews prior to deciding and most of what is said is true. Clean rooms, great location, nice staff (spoke various languages- which is a plus in Paris). Expect a business type hotel look and feel. It is medium size, clean and fairly new. But, charm and family style it is not. Think Marriott or Hilton. Location is key here. Right acros the street from the St Phillipe Metro station. That track connects witht he main A track that runs along the Champs-Elysses, Rivoli stops which you will find is the centrl, most traveled line for tourist attractions. You csn also walk 3 blocks to the Champs. There you have 4 blocks to the Arc di Trumph one way and 4 blocks to the Place de Concorde the other way. Also, shopping on the Rue Fuasberg Honore is 5 minutes walking for world class shoppes and galleries. This location is great! We had a street view room on the 3rd floor. There is street noise as the street in front is a side street, but used heavily to get to the Champs Elysses. So lots of honking and noise at all hours, even late night. There are also 3 gentlements clubs/bars accross the street which provide lots of noise to the street. I guess since the narrow street with tall building encloses the noise it amplifies and is heard. The windows do keep out most of it, but it is not a quiet place. Since we were out mostly sightseeing and came back so tired we knocked out and the noise did really get to us. I want to specifically thank the concierge, Luis, who was very helpful and truly went out of his way to make our stay fantastic. he arrange ticket to the museum, river baot rides, reservations, taxis, airport transfers, etc. All with a smile and with true professionalism. He is an asset to this establishment. Thank you Luis. We got a real value booking a special I received thru Travellzoo.com.

The lobby was impeccable and the staff didn't mind our little ones being noisy for a bit.

The rooms are lovely and well appointed. The location cannot be beat! The Champs Elysses is about a block away and the Arc du Triomphe is a five minute walk. There's a Metro just around the corner, along with patisseries, shops, pharmacies, a grocery store, etc. But who needs a grocery store when you've got breakfast at Hotel Rochester? What a wonderful breakfast---lots of lovely pastries, meats, eggs, cereal, toast...everything! And the staff is superb. The waiters found out it was our last day and performed magic tricks for the boys. Most importantly----they alerted us to an upcoming transportation strike. They knew we were checking out the day the strike was supposed to occur and asked us if they could help us make back-up arrangements for getting to the Gard du Nord train station for the Eurostar since most taxis would also be on strike. They thought of everything and took care of us very well. It was a bit more money than some other hotels we were considering but well worth it for the pleasant staff, beautiful rooms, and location.

The hotel is easily accessible to major shopping areas and some excellent restaurants. Paris is the kind of place that reservations are a necessity. I am going to mark this hotel down one notch on the sleep quality and room this time because of the fact that the maid's supply room was located right next door and it sounded like someone was trying to come into our room every time the maid went into the next door room for more supplies. This was a luxury week of shopping and there really was no need to be awakened at 6am. Also, the air conditioning seemed to be a little \"off;\" the weather was unexpectedly HOT during our stay and even with the AC on fan speed of 3 and 15 celsius the room was still too hot . . . we would have opened the window, but the courtyard below was where all the smokers congregated and that made for a nice cigarette odor in the room. All to say, that this was the wrong room, but the right hotel. The concierge, Luis, should be commended and given a raise for his expert advice on how to get the best view of the Eiffel Tower (the Trocadero' exit off of the Metro), and securing us a private driver for shopping when ours didn't show up. Finally, he arranged for a private car to take us to the airport upon check out because . . . there was a NATIONAL transportation strike on the day we were leaving . . . no rail, taxi, or bus service.

What a lovely hotel. The room was absolutely perfect - very Parisian, with just enough space for all my clothes! I read other reviews before we left and was a little worried about what we would find - the hotel is 4 star but other reviews had described it as much lower. I do not agree with them. Others have said that the beds were old and uncomfortable. I checked - new matresses! They must have recently updated them. It's true that they are quite soft - personally I like a firm matress, but for a short stay it's no problem - especially with the lovely fluffy pillows and duvet. One of the best things about the room is that there's a balcony window. The large windows open out onto a small - not walkable - but perfectly formed balcony. We had a view of the courtyard so that was lovely. When the windows are shut you can't hear what's happening in the courtyard which was good as there was some sort of work going on the first day we arrived. But the thing we appreciated most was the DVD player and high-tech tv. I've experienced ancient tv sets in hotel rooms before, so this was great. Unfortunately if you're from England - the only channels available from home are BBC worldwide (not bad) and Sky News. The latter is atrocious, too American. But it gave us some laughs. Bring DVDS. It plays english ones (and I reckon European ones too). When you're tired after a day of sightseeing there's nothing better than a warm bath and a nice film. Which brings me onto the bathroom - great, everything you need - with clean surfaces etc. The bath is excellent - tap is really fast and the water is lovely and hot and the shower is so powerful! I found that since I had to wash my feet after walking about Paris every evening (If you wear flip flops be prepared for this - Parisian streets are filthy!) the hot water was very welcome. Other good things about this hotel included that they allowed us to check in 2 hours early - we'd been told 2pm for check-in. Otherwise we were just going to leave our bags with them and come back. A bad point about this was that when we did leave our bags with them in the morning after we checked out (our train was not until 7pm) they simply left them in the corridor by the doors. We felt this was a little bad for a 4* hotel, since we were told most had a room where they could be stored. So, make sure no valuables are left there whilst you see the last of the city. We found the staff to be helpful, if not overly friendly. The buffet breakfast was alright, certainly not the best I've had, but adequate. Certainly not worth 25 euros though. (Ours was included in our room and eurostar deal.) The location of the hotel was fantastic! It was a short walk from the middle of the Champs Elysees...and then a minute from Franklin D Roosevelt metro station. Make sure you shop around for a place to eat along the avenue, some are more expensive than others for the same thing. We went to a place called Vesuvio on the first night - i had a (very very cheesy) magerita and my boyfriend had carbonara. Decent food - expensive considering what it was, but that's the euro for you. Just a tip - check the prices of the coca cola at each restaurant, that should give you an idea of how much they think they can charge you for the basics. I've seen one resturant along there charge 6 euros for it, and another only 4. Strange. There's also a mini supermarket and a sort of small department store down the road from the hotel for you to stock up on things for your room - instead of the mini bar which is always expensive!", "Date": "July 9, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Winnipeg, Canada", "Title": "\u201cBeautiful hotel, excellent location\u201d", "Author": "VandyMance", "ReviewID": "UR68792176", "Content": "Hotel Rochester is in a fabulous location, within walking distance to many Paris landmarks including the Eiffel Tower.

I just got back and for the most part wasn't impressed. There is definitely a different star system rating in France than in the US. This hotel was rated a 4 star in France, I would give it about 2 or 3. The pictures posted ARE misleading. I stayed in a standard room and it was not nearly as large as the ones posted for standard rooms on their website. The rooms on the website that are spacious are actually triple rooms. The hotel is located across the street from a bar or restaurant where patrons get into fights until 4 am. I asked to have a room on the courtyard for some quiet. That was even worse. If your room faces the courtyard you will have to deal with the noise of other occupants who don't close their windows and talk very loudly. I had to complain about the noise level of some loud upstairs neighbors and some conventioneers who thought it was okay to blast, and I do mean blast their music with the windows open. Sound echoes in the courtyard and even closing the windows doesn't drown it out. Another occupant had to threaten to call the police on the noise makers to get them to quiet down. The hotel management, who could obviously hear the noise from the front desk because the courtyard opens onto the lobby, took forever to act on the noise, that is if they acted on it at all. Another bad thing about the rooms are the sheets and towels. I swear the sheets are only 50 thread count. They are very rough to the touch. The towels absolutely felt like sand paper. The decor was even more plain and uninviting than a Holiday Inn. There is one picture on the wall in the corner. It's not a very welcoming place to come back to after a long day of sightseeing. The TV gets 3 English channels; CNN, Sky News, and some sports channel. The bathrooms are kept very clean, but depending on the configuration of the room they can be very tiny. The first room we had was very narrow with a glass half-door instead of a shower curtain. It also had no exhaust. The second room had a larger bathroom, a shower curtain, and a small window that could be opened to let the steam escape. The elevator can only fit one person with luggage or two people without. You do get a card key which is good because some hotels in Paris give you a regular key and confiscate it when you are going out on the town . The reception area is open 24 hours. The staff is polite. We did not consult them for anything other than issues about the room. The room has an in closet safe, a mini-bar, and an Iron/ironing board only on request. The courtyard is actually very tiny and only has two tables out there. We did not bother with the breakfast.There is a supermarket up the street and a metro less than a block away, both of which came in handy. We were charged for some items from the mini-bar when we never even opened the mini-bar. The charges were removed from our bill at check-out. We were actually able to take the Air-France bus to the Arc de Triomphe from the airport and walk to the hotel to keep our expenses down.

The hotel staff were all friendly and helpful, and the concierge made excellent suggestions for everything I asked of him. After looking at hundreds of Paris hotels online, I can authoritatively say that this hotel's rooms are WAY above average in size and amenities in the $200 range. The room was large enough to fit a desk, table and chair, and a very comfortable bed with tables on both sides. There was a minibar, safe and flat screen tv as well. The marble-clad bathroom was immaculate, with plush towels and robe, big tub and shower, and at least ten nice-quality toiletry items. A well-stocked patisserie was right around the corner, with outside seating that offered inexpensive and delicious pastries and the best quiche I've ever had. Just a few doors down was a shop where a STUFFED sandwich of lovely, crusty French bread, fresh meats and vegetables could be had for under 4 euros. A walk in the other direction brings you to the Champs Elysees, where it's all happenin'! In either direction, metro stops are close by.

For those of you with +2 young children you will know how hard it is to find somewhere suitable to stay and Paris is particularly challenging. Having searched numerous hotels from guide books in Trip Advisor the Rochester looked a consistently good choice and it was. It's very well located 2 mins from the Metro and 2 mins from the Champs Elysees. You can walk to the Eiffel Tower in about 30 mins, the Louvre is about the same and the Notre Dame is about an hour away. Cross the Champs Elysees and you soon come to the Avenue Montaigne with its very exclusive fashion houses - Chanel, Hermes etc. You won't be able to go in to these shops unless you are ultra rich but its good fun to look and imagine. The hotel was smart, very tastefully decorated and the reception staff were always helpful. This is not a big gltzy hotel but if you want that in Paris you will need to pay a lot more money. We had 2 rooms next to each other which worked well, high up on the 7th floor. Everything was very comparable with a 4 star hotel in the UK. You don't get drinks making facilties in the room but you do get a minibar (an expensve option as always) but there is a supermarket across the road if you want to buy some drinks to have on hand. We emailed the hotel direct after booking through an agent to ensure we got suitable rooms for our needs and they were very obliging. Our deal included breakfast (23 euros if extra) which is a great plus when many hotels in Paris won't include breakfaats in the price. It was the usual mixture of european cuisines - meats, fruits, cereals, a small selection of hot food - and whilst the breakfast room was small we only had to wait a few times for a short while. A few top tips if you are going to Paris, especially with children. Pre-book your tickets for the Eiffel Tower because the queues are nearly always several hours long. The Batobus, a circular ferry service (Eiffel, Musee Orsay, St Germain, Notre Dame, Jardin des Plantes, Hotel de Ville, Champes Elysees) is a good way to get around. The Metro is easy to use and the Mobilisi ticket (1 to 5 days unlimited travel) is a good bet and you purchase it in the station from the automated machines (NB - you can choose English and scroll down for the 'Other Tickets' options. You can pay with your debit card.)

Both beds were really comfortable and offered plenty of room, to be fair we all could have slept in the king sized bed it was so big. The bathroom was also a delight and a good size, for a Parisian hotel it was a huge bathroom! With plenty of fresh towels, soaps, shampoo etc. We had a bath with a shower above it which was perfect with plenty of hot water. Everything about the room and bathroom was clean, I have no complaints and we had air conditioning which meant our room was always a comfortable temperature. In the booking I had made breakfast was included, otherwise I think it's and extra 23euros each, which I personally wouldn't pay. The breakfast was really good. The hotel offer a selection of bread, pastries, fruit, yoghurts, cold meats and cheese and smoked salmon. They also have hot breakfasts of egg, bacon and sausage.

We arrived on the Eurostar at Sunday lunchtime and the taxi to the hotel from the Gare du Nord cost around 10 Euros. As a tip, give Paris a miss on a Sunday - it's dead. My first impression was that the hotel is very gold! Reception is gleaming brass and marble, and I reckon they put yellow lightbulbs in! The hotel is spotlessly clean and has lovely room amenities. The minibar is of course expensive! The bathroom has everything you need and the TV in the room has lots of channels including a movie channel that showed occasional movies in English! To my surprise I discovered that American movies are right - you can see the Eiffel Tower from the hotel room! You had to lean out and twist a bit, but there it was... My French is rusty to say the least but this was not a problem in the Rochester. There were people from lots of different countries staying at the hotel and the staff communicated well with them all. Shops and cashpoints are very close and convenient, and there is a bar or a restaurant every few doors! There is also a 24 hour pharmacy on the opposite end of the street (closer to the Champs-Elysses). General points about our trip to Paris: Everywhere was close and within walking distance. We walked to the Eiffel Tower on the first day, and on the second day we bought a 2-day bus ticket with Les Cars Rouge. It takes you round the main sights in about 2 1/2 hours, or you can get on and off as you like. The ticket was around 20 Euros and lasts 2 days, so we used it a lot for the rest of our visit! Sometimes the driving was a little exhilarating but I have a feeling it's all part of the Paris experience. 2 days was not enough to see everything we wanted to see, and we will definitely return. I would not hesitate to go back to the Rochester again.", "Date": "February 15, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "London", "Title": "\u201cLovely Hotel Excellent Location\u201d", "Author": "alexia_a", "ReviewID": "UR12322153", "Content": "I booked this hotel for my finacee and I for 30/12/2007-01/01/2008 I thought I got an excellent deal with lastminute.com the accommodation (room only basis) and BA flights for just under \u00a3500GBP for both of us because of this my friend and her boyfriend joined us. I looked the hotel on trip advisor before booking and was happy to see all of the great reviews and when I arrived it was even better! We arrived at CDG airport and decided before hand that we would take the metro to the hotel as a taxi transfer was 140EUR. It took about 2 hours from the airport to the hotel you have to change lines twice. After the long journey to the nearest station to the hotel (St Phillipe de Roue) once we came out we could see the hotel right in front of us which was a relief after the long journey. When we arrived at the hotel we were very impressed inside and out the decor was lovely. The check in was quick and we were escorted to our room. As soon as I went in the room it did smell a bit of stale smoke (I am a non smoker) but after a minute I didnt notice it. The room decor was of a very high standard and spotless. You could tell it had been recently renovated. If staying at this hotel you should request a room facing the court yard as my friend'd room was not and she could hear the noise from the street. The hotel had two laptops in the lobbby area where you could have free internet access which I thought was great, but they should really have a time limit as people do stay n it for hours. The location of the hotel was excellent! 5 minute walk to the Champs Elysee. The staff at all times were very helpful and even let us check out at 2pm instead of 12pm. The only down side of the trip which has nothing to do with the accommodation is how expensive everything was. a can of coke in a cafe on the Champs Elysee was 6 EUR!!!

The Good: The hotel is on the Rue la Boetie, which is only two blocks from the Champs Elysees, near the rond point FDR. Decent sized rooms. There is free internet and the staff is helpful, if not overly competent. (After paying, I asked a question about my bill and watched as the desk attendant fished a copy of my bill out of the trash with my credit card number, expiration date and name written across the top...eek!) The Bad: Pancake-like pillows, one extra blanket for a twin room, not-too-comfortable beds and a general worn-out and tired look to the rooms. And, of course, that credit card issue...

Our room was thoroughly cleaned each day...the bed linens were crisp and clean, the bathroom was always sparkling clean with lots of fresh towels available. The bathroom was done in marble...we had one king-sized bed and it was HUGE...more like a California King..and soooo comfortable. The location was superb. You walk about 2 blocks to the Champs Elysee..(we walked day & nite..lots of people around). The cabfare you save by staying at this location is considerable. From here, we walked everywhere, which is the way to see Paris! The Rochester is just blocks from L'arc de triumphe where you can catch the subway to just about anywhere.....or walk to Bato Bus which is the BEST mode of transportation to see all the of tourist sites if you don't want to walk. I would definitely stay at the Rochester again. The other hotels in the same general location are not worth spending more for. The only thing I would say about staying here or at any other hotel in Paris is that the price for including breakfast is not worth it ( for us anyway) ...we only wanted pastry and coffe in the morning and you can just walk up to the Champs and buy it for a fraction of the cost; sit down outside the cafe and \"people watch\"", "Date": "November 11, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "4", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Arkansas", "Title": "\u201cGreat Hotel, Perfect Location\u201d", "Author": "bddoughty", "ReviewID": "UR10647135", "Content": "October 23, 2007 for eight nights Though check-in was a bit disorienting as French TV was filming in the Lobby making it difficult for me to locate the lift through the bright lights and what seemed like a sea of people, the Rochester Champs Elysees could not have been a better choice. The staff are efficient, though certainly not overly friendly, it is France after all; nonetheless, they were most responsive, particularly to my needs relating to an urgent need to check email and follow up with several phone calls to home due to an emergency. I was most grateful. The Hotel Lobby is very tasteful, the breakfast room small but nice, the breakfast was wonderfully plentiful with a wide variety of choices, healthy and not so healthy. Though my first room was larger than the second, I choose to move to a quieter location overlooking the inner courtyard and away from the lift as the noise from the lift produced an overwhelmingly annoying low level scratching sound that just about drove me insane. I believe it was #609. I moved to #311 which as noted was smaller but it was blissfully quiet. A large double French window that fully opened onto the courtyard. Flat Screen TV, Desk, Chair and lots of closet space with a safety box. The bath was a bit small though polished. Shower/tub with lots of bath soaps and gels supplied. Housekeeping Great, though a bit loud in the morning. Location is truly minutes from the Champs Elysees in one direction and Rue du Faubourg Saint-Honore in the other direction. Most everything you need within a very short distance. Overall, this is a well managed property, tasteful with aspects of elegance here and there.

The daybed (not pullout) in the outer room was very comfortable. We had 2 flat-screen TVs and nice robes and towels. The hotel staff was friendly and accommodating. I needed milk to take with some medication just as the restaurant staff was setting up for breakfast. Although I was more than hapy to pay for the milk, it was given to me generously and graciously. As others have noted, the location is quiet and very convenient to the Metro. The major line to the Louvre is a 5 minute walk away on the Champs Elysees, and another line to the Eiffel Tower and Boulevard Haussmann is steps away. Other neighborhood amenities include a boulangerie and grocery store within a few yards of the hotel . Dalloyau teahouse and pastries is a couple of blocks away on the elegant Faubourg Saint-Honore. Their chocolates and pastries are not to be believed, and they offer gourmet food to go that rivals anything we've had in San Francisco, although it does not come cheap. B of A customers will find a no-fee Paribas branch with ATMs half a block away. The proximity to Champs Elysees allowed my daughters to have some independence in a safe environment.
