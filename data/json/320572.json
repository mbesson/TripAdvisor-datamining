{"Reviews": [{"Content": "Affordable business hotel in a prime location During my recent stay in Tokyo I was looking for something in Roppongi that would be clean and reasonably priced. Hotel Ibis met what I was looking for in this regard. The hotel is steps away from Roppongi crossing with easy access to the subway, Roppongi Hills and Tokyo Midtown. The rooms are very small but clean and functional. Despite its rowdy surroundings, the room I had was plenty quiet at night. BTW, I sure enjoyed my hi-tech Japanese toilet. The staff of the hotel is very helpful for directions or making local phone calls. The price of the hotel is reasonable for the area. This is a good option for a single traveler, couples should look elsewhere.", "Date": "Oct 30, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR307145152", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "jwobkk"}, {"Content": "The hotel version of a Mini Cooper The Ibis is centrally-located in Roppongi and is known to all the cab drivers. The rooms are extremely small. I am a small-framed man (5'10, 140 lbs), but I could imagine someone heavier than myself having trouble negotiating the miniature washroom fixtures.Everything was clean and little details abounded. Just because the rooms are small does not mean they are poorly finished. I would compare the Ibis to a Mini Cooper -- small, but with charming details and great finishing touches.While not ideal for business travelers (there was nowhere to hang a suit bag), the Internet connection was excellent and the ambiance was upscale. Another review hinted at prostitution, but I saw nothing of the sort. While the Ibis is located in Roppongi (a nightclub district), most of the other guests appeared to be businessmen.", "Date": "Jul 1, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR885704497", "Ratings": {"Service": "-1", "Business service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "Continental_Op"}, {"Content": "Great location You cannot beat this location if you want to stay in Roppongi.

The hotel is a dump. Rooms are almost cubicles. It is not just compact, it is much worse than that. Don't let me mention the bathrooms.I could see old men with suspiciously looking young women parading around. Not the best if you have children with you.Location is good if you want to stay around Roppongi but that is the only good thing you could say about this Dump.", "Date": "Jun 15, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR225500846", "Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Business service": "1", "Cleanliness": "1", "Check in / front desk": "2", "Overall": "1", "Value": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "3"}, "Author": "EZT"}, {"Content": "Not sure why people are so keen Tiny cramped room. Not all that cheap either compared to the Park Hotel, which we loved.

We were surprise to find a English speaking receptionist and she was very very helpful in answering our queries.The hotel was just a minutes away from exit 4a from Roppongi station and around the hotel has a convience store, a MOS burger restaurant, a ramen restaurant just at the door step(beside) of the hotel.It was near the Roppongi hill and hard rock cafe and even the tokyo tower. It seem that there;s a lot of tourist at this area as I can see a lot of causasian. We stay in a double room. It was better than a five star hotel we stay in takayama. The hotel even provided shampoo conditioning which many hotel do not have. The only thing lacking is probably a safe box.In all, we enjoy our trips in Japan. We would definitely come back to this hotel. We love UENO. If there's a hotel there around, we would love to go there too. Food and everything in Ueno is basically much more cheaper.", "Date": "Nov 6, 2006", "ReviewID": "UR579959348", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "speh"}, {"Content": "Highly Recommended I stayed at the Hotel Ibis Roppongi in May 2006 and was very impressed with the hotel. The room was very clean but a little small then again this is Japan so by comparison to other hotels I had used in Japan the room size was ok. The staff were very helpfull and pleasant. But the best thing about this hotel is the location. There are two underground stations within a minute's walk and plenty of shops and resteraunts all very close by, this is also an ideal location for those wanting to let their hair down at the weekend as their are loads of clubs and nightclubs all within a 5-10 minute walk of the hotel.Another plus point of this hotel is the price, I booked this hotel direct over the Internet who took my credit card details but did not charge me until I had arrived.Would highly recommend this hotel and if I visit Tokyo again I will be using this hotel", "Date": "Oct 22, 2006", "ReviewID": "UR580476120", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "3", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "5", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "lsjs.uk"}, {"Content": "Hotel Ibis was great! My friend and I stayed at the Hotel Ibis in Roppongi, Tokyo in June/July. The staff there was very, very helpful, especially when we had questions reagarding locations and directions to places. They were very polite and efficient when checking us in and helping with our bags to our rooms. The rooms were a little bit small, but I think that most places in Japan are, if you are comparing Western places to them. Nevertheless, they were clean, comfortable and quiet.
