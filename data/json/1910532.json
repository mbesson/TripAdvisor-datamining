Rooms were nice and comfortable, very clean, showers were awesome (his and hers). My one beef is that it's kind of hard to find (sort of hidden) and the parking around the area is a little steep.

We were in Montreal for a concert at the Bell Centre so the location and cost were ideal for our needs. I made the reservation over the phone easily and was advised I could request a room upgrade (if avaialable) upon check-in. Once we found the unassuming entrance on Drummond Street, staff at check-in was friendly, quick and the upgrade had been taken care of without me having to ask. We loved the room! Decor was modern and comfortable, room was clean and well stocked with local touches (handmade soap and bath products). We really liked having the iPod docking station/stereo getting ready for the show! Albeit a minor flaw to consider, the TV is rather far/too small for viewing from bed. Breakfast options were limited but I was permitted to take a tray of coffee, juice and pastries up to the room instead since we weren't up in time to go down to the restaurant. We would definitely make a point of staying there again if the circumstances were the same. Front desk staff would be best to have a list of recommendations for food etc.. in the area.

The soundproofing is the second improvement that could be made, the sound from the hallway was quite loud, and understandably so, when there was a opening under the door so high that you could see the light on the other side. Cleaning wise I would have liked if they would have mopped the floor, as the amount of salt that is used in Montreal really leaves trails.

TV in room had only the very basic cable service, so most of the channels that had stuff I wanted to watch were not available. The hotel has no umbrellas either.

Pleasantly surprised by plush spa robe and slippers, free wi-fi, free calls to Canada and US, free continental breakfast. Staff was extremely friendly and helpful, but not trained.

Would ask for a 3rd floor room. Room doors slammed in the hall as guests came/left, but no housekeeping noise. Two beds, desk, wardrobe, chair. Spacious enough but very black and dark and a bit tricky to negotiate. Decor is minimal and trendy cool. Good a/c unit is very quiet. Lighting - OK for reading in bed but otherwise the room is very dim. For serious work, would need to request an additional lamp. Inside the entry door, and from bathroom, are 3 steps down on a completely black floor that could be a falling hazard.

It seemed like the perfect place for a romantic getaway and it didn't disappoint. As others have reported, the hotel can be a little tricky to find so keep an eye out for the 2 glass doors to the immediate left of the Liquid Nutrition juice bar. Parking is located halfway down the block, closer to rue Saint-Catherine. You can park your car first and check into the hotel after. There is also free, temporary street parking in front of the hotel if you want to check in first. You'll be given a parking voucher, which gives you a discount at the garage. The garage is a little dark and narrow but it's safe and staffed 24/7. Parking for 3 nights over the weekend was $50, which I didn't think was too bad. You can apparently go in and out of the parking garage and pay a lump sum at the end but we didn't do that. The hotel is extremely well located in downtown Montreal... Peel metro station is about 2 minutes away and there are countless restaurants, bars and shops in the area. All of this is great, however the neigbourhood can be quite noisy at night. If you're not used to the noise, you may find it difficult to get a good night's sleep. There is also a restaurant located directly below the hotel, which has a fairly large patio. The sound of restaurant patrons and the music playing in the restaurant is almost always present in the room (from 9am to past midnight). It's nothing an air conditioner or TV can't drown out when trying to sleep but I think this may bother some people used to quieter environments. The room itself is totally unique and unlike any other hotel I've stayed in. The bathroom is incredibly modern and clean. The shower is truly amazing... a two person rain head shower with a window looking into the bedroom definitely makes this a wonderful place for couples. There is a safe large enough to fit a laptop, free bottled water, bathrobes and a hair dryer in the room. A fridge would've been nice and I didn't see any do not disturb signs either... funny, considering it's geared towards couples. Breakfast consists of coffee and very large pastries.

The toiletries are from a local company - Bella Pella - and were awesome (actually went to their shop and bought some soap to take back with it).

The staff there were fantastic. Very friendly and helpful. One girl on the front desk helped us find the best Thai restaurant - in a spot that we never would have visited on our own. We also made good use of the free wi-fi to find places to visit during our stay and they also offer free local & long distance calls (in North America) which was a nice additional feature. The location of the hotel is also excellent - make sure you keep an eye out for the blue-lit entrance as there isn't a sign. There are tons of restaurants/bars and shops near by, as well as the Peel Metro station. Also, in the mornings they have croissants & a variety of teas/coffees (Nespresso) available in the lobby which is a great way to start the day. Overall, we had a fantastic experience at this hotel.

The towels and the bathroom robes were thick and so wonderful to have. The breakfast was simple, but \"sweet\" arranged in the lobby as the cafe is still under construction, nevertheless enjoyed it. The staff, like Richard the \"the room service Lion\" and Dwayne, the associate manager and others were very friendly and very professional, a true rare species nowadays. Finally, the central location of the hotel made our stay in Montreal a true delight as Saint Catherine street was a block away.", "Date": "February 7, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Boston, Massachusetts", "Title": "\u201cLoved Chez Swann\u201d", "Author": "hello031", "ReviewID": "UR87800646", "Content": "Definitely enjoyed my stay at Chez Swann. Everything feels brand new and sparkling clean. The funky decor is consistent throughout and added a little extra enjoyment to my stay, as opposed to some standard brand hotel. The pastries and espresso for breakfast are top quality and in my opinion eliminate the need to find breakfast elsewhere. And the staff were always friendly and helpful. Overall, Chez Swann is a great value, conveniently located, clean, and very quiet.

I was enticed by the fantastic location and good value [$125.00 Cdn B &B]. The hotel is brand new and just getting on it's feet. The rooms are fresh and trendy and very comfortable. The staff is friendly and accomodating and the hotel is spotless. The hotel does not have a formal restaurant or bar but it is right in the middle of downtown Montreal which gives one plenty of choice, but it would be nice to have a coffee maker in the room just to wake you up before you leave your room. Breakfast is served in the lobby and you can take it up to your room. There is a choice of very good pastries and expresso. On the whole I would definitely stay again but if you are looking for all the amenities offered in the bigger hotels then this would not be my choice. If you want something more intimate and cozy then this is highly recommended.", "Date": "November 16, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Laconia, New Hampshire", "Title": "\u201cfulfilled our expectations and added to overall enjoyment of Montreal\u201d", "Author": "goodfind", "ReviewID": "UR87081650", "Content": "We would return on our next visit but would like offer some constructive critisism.
