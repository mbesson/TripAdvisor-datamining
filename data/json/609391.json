It's in an excellent location, very close to the city center in a great neighborhood. Staff couldn't have been nicer and the hostel cat was cool. Rooms are prety small, and we were fortunate enough to have our own private bathroom which was also very small but was fine for our stay.", "Date": "June 19, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Cambridge, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cClean, anonymous and ok\"\u201d", "Author": "caupolican", "ReviewID": "UR78111658", "Content": "This place is OK. It is very clean and there are good comfortable beds and the rooms are not too small for singles. The TV works well and it is very quiet. At least as far as the outside is concerned. It has a nice location not far from Malasana, Chueca and the Gran Via. However beware, the walls are very thin, so if you have a honeymoon couple next door it may be trying. But all in all not a bad choice, although it is quite anonymous and y9ou rarely see members of staff etc.", "Date": "September 3, 2010"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Hostal Dominguez", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g187514-d609391-Reviews-Hostal_Dominguez-Madrid.html", "Price": "0", "Address": "<address class=\"addressReset\"><span rel=\"v:address\"><span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">Calle Santa Brigada 1</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:postal-code\">28004</span> <span property=\"v:locality\">Madrid</span></span>, <span class=\"country-name\" property=\"v:country-name\">Spain</span> </span></span></address>", "HotelID": "609391", "ImgURL": ""}}
