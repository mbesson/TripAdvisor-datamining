I am in San Diego twice a month and normally stay in La Jolla, but they were sold out so I decided on the residence inn mission valley because of the location and I love Marriotts. So I arrived at 4:15, and no rooms were ready, even though check in is \"guarenteed\" by 4. No big deal, they said they would call as soon as a room was ready so I got some lunch while I was waiting. I never got a phone call, so I went back after my lunch at 5:30 or so and finally was able to get a room. When I got to the room I was assigned, it was not even cleaned! So I went back to the front desk, which is not easy at this hotel because you have to go outside and it was raining, to inform them and get a new room. So after arriving at 4:15, I did not get into a clean room until almost 6. They were serving a full dinner until 7, it was wings that night which sounded great, but by the time I got to my room and down to the dinner at 6:40, there were no wings left! So by now, I was a little frustrated but still ok with the situation. Then, the next day after work I wanted to shower, but during the service that day, no towels were left which was weird. I called and politely asked for more towels, which then took about 45 minutes to get there. This is when I started to get frustrated because of all the mishaps so I called to speak to a manager, but no manager was on duty to speak with so I asked the front desk to have them contact me the next morning on my cell phone because I would already be checked out and at work, but never received a call!! Are you kidding me?? In the end, I paid about $450 for a frustrating experience and I WILL NEVER STAY THERE AGAIN!!! Recommend that others do the same!!!

The room was comfortable and quiet even though there were several families with small children at the hotel during our stay. The fitness center, game room, and outdoor bbq and firepit were great amenities. The only \"complaint\" I have was in regard to an evening fire alarm which went off... while we were all standing outside in the parking lot, no one from the hotel came out to let us know it was a false alarm and we could go back inside. We were practically the last family standing outside in our jammies waiting for the \"all clear\" which never came. Aside from that small oversight though, it was a wonderful stay and I HIGHLY recommend this hotel for anyone looking to stay in the San Diego area.

Trash was full under kitchen cabinet, my husband had to take it out himself. The bed sheets and pillow cases smelled like sweat. There were only 5 small hangers in the closet (for a 6 day stay, 12 pairs of outfit for my husband and my self, 5 hangers aren't sufficient). I addressed the cleanliness issue to the front desk and I fairness, she offered to transfer us to a different room but since it was past 11 PM and having cleaned the bathroom door, disinfected all the lateral surface including toilet bowl, door knobs, light switches, and tv remote control, I just asked to have the linens/pillowcases changed and provide more hangers. Well, it took me a phone call, 1 trip to the front desk, and my husband to take a trip again to the front desk before we get a clean set of linens and more hangers.....a total of over 1 hour. Speaking of housekeeping, the batch of housekeepers were the MOST LAZY I have ever encountered (next to Residence Inn Airport and Greenbrier Norfolk, VA). I have to call to get our room serviced, ask for fresh towels, and have our linens changed mid-week). This place used to be pleasant in 2009-2010.

Front desk was a bit scatty-boo and un-organized, elevator broke during our stay and was never repaired, our card keys only worked once and a while which is really awesome when you need it to get into the parking lot (so yea, cars are waiting behind you and your stupid card wont work). The room layout is the most idiotic thing I have ever seen. Our room had two bedrooms with one bathroom that is only accessible through the master room. VERY inconvenient for anyone sleeping in there, it was so annoying. Housekeeping rarely ever did anything to our room and would never refill or replace anything.

We had a 1 bedroom suite with kitchen. I took my family along including a 3 yr old and 1 year old, but we squeezed into the 1 bedroom since it was covered by per diem. All I can say is that we loved this place. The customer service is just outstanding. By the time we finished our stay we got to know just about every member of the staff and several of the maintenance folks. They were all top notch. Here are just a few examples of how they took care of us: - For stays over a month they provide free parking. We were just under that, but they still provided it - for 2 cars. - When we got there our room did not have the separate bedroom but was more of a suite. We really needed the separate bedroom for our jet lagged kids. They moved us right away no problem. - We needed a network cable that would reach our bedroom so we could let the kids sleep in the other room. Until they could make a wire long enough for us (the next day) they provided a wireless router in the interim to make sure we were happy. - There was a Southern California power outage one night that shut the city down. The management handled it great. They just extended the complimentary dinner hours and complimentary open bar until they ran out of stuff and cranked up the grill and started grilling all their burgers and dogs for the guests. It was like a big party! - Even with the power outage, the maintenance guys came right away and changed the battery in our beeping smoke alarm. In summary, we loved it and we will stay there any time we are back in town. It's one of the best deals I've ever found for a place with a separate bedroom which is a necessity with napping kids.

The coupon was not a typical hotel promotion -- it looked to be torn from a Happy Meal bag -- and we appreciated her thoughtfulness as much as the money we saved. We stayed in one of the two-room suites with the bunk beds. We were surprised and pleased to find that the bunk beds were very sturdy. There was no wireless internet in the room, but the cable connection was in a convenient place that could be used at the desk or on the couch. This was also the first hotel we've stayed at where our room had been prepared as feather-free in advance. Every other time, we have had to wait for housekeeping to be called and make the change. However, we stayed multiple days and the successive housekeeping visits changed the room back to feathered pillows which was frustrating. The only other complaint we had was that our fourth floor room was under an a/c unit or something else that made quite a loud, constant vibration sound in the kitchen/family area. However, since the noise could not be heard in either bedroom, we did not ask to be moved. The hotel just down the road from Old Town and within an easy 10 minute drive to Sea World.

We were thrilled to find this facility which gave us just what we needed and included a free breakfast that would rival any in town. The suite that we got was very large. It had two separate bedrooms and two full bathrooms plus a fully equipped kitchen with modern appliances, including a dishwasher! Each bedroom and the sitting/dining area had its own TV, ample closet spaces and bathroom amenities (including hairdryers in each room) with great showers. One bedroom had a king bed, the other had two queen beds and the sofa in the sitting/dining area folded out into another bed. It was perfect for the five of us! The place has a lovely pool and a jacuzzi tub - great for tiring out the kids and ensuring a good night's sleep. The breakfast room was a very pleasant space, with a play area for smaller folk. Served buffet style, the food selection is more than adequate - cereals (including oatmeal), yogurt, fruit, scrambled eggs, bacon/sausage, breads, AND two waffle irons which cooked up the fluffiest waffles ever! All this was rounded up with a good selection of condiments and trimmings, tea, and coffee. What a deal! Again, just what we needed to get our group ready for our treks around the zoo. The Residence Inn does not have a restaurant on its premises; however, with its location on Hotel Circle South, restaurants were available in other locations along the strip of hotels. Better yet, it is an easy drive to Old Town San Diego where restaurants and shopping abound. Really, it was an easy drive from the hotel to most San Diego attractions and destinations.

I thought this was very nice of her. The complimentary dinner on Mon-Thurs was a very nice touch and helped us to save money. The food was good - not fabulous, but good and filling. The free continental breakfast each morning was also a nice addition. The hotel was quiet and clean. Our children loved having their own room with bunk beds. And we loved having our own king size room! The pool and jacuzzi were warm. The exercise room did it's job. It had two elipticals, two treadmils and one stationary bike. I was hoping for free weights, but that is okay. We loved the fire pits and sat around them in the evening. Other patrons of the hotel were very friendly. Only downside, was the cleaning of the room. It just happened that each time they came to clean our room we had just got done swimming and were in the middle of getting dressed. The ladies weren't very happy that we wouldn't give them access to our room until we were ready to vacate. Oh, and parking...$13/day - not too high in comparison with other hotels you can stay at in the area. However, you had to use your room key to access the parking lot.

Check in was easy and the staff was nice and very attentive to any requests, although this hotel has a few things that need improvement in order to make it an excellent choice ...for possibly next time. First the very odd entrance structure. After arriving to the hotel we had unloaded our luggage on a cart at the entrance. After checking in we were given a map and directions to go back outside and drive around to access our room. We didn't know that we couldn't access our room from the lobby at arrival time and it was very awkward to try to find out how to get our luggage cart to our room without having to load it all back in the van and drive around. So we when we finished checking in we had to find an alternative route and we ended up rolling the full luggage cart out through the hotel entrance and through the pool area and then entered the building from the courtyard where our room was located and then finally up the elevator. So, later we found out how we actually had to drive around to the side of the hotel where access to our room was located and unload and enter from this side entrance. At these side entrances there was no official load/unload areas. Also, we had to manually open and hold the single entrance door, carry luggage on/over concrete steps, no ramps, no automatic doors, luckily there were five of us to all help each other. It was just such a strange and inconvenient entrance set up. Not to mention that all the parking spaces were very narrow and tight, and since there was not an official load and unload area at these side entrances you have to park in one of the spaces almost hitting the car next to you upon opening your car door and unload from your space unless you block other parking spaces to unload directly at the side door. Not sure if it was set up this way for security purposes but was very awkward and very inconvenient for a family of five on vacation. Once in the room we had to repeatedly request extra linens for the Sofa sleeper and towels as they provide enough for two to three people, when we had a reservation for five in our family. The sofa sleeper was not bad but was not good either. No fault of the hotel, but the sofa sleepers are just not comfortable so I slept on it so my children did not have to endure the uncomfortableness. The double beds were very comfortable. The hotel room and decor was very modern and clean. Kitchen was nicely updated with new stainless steal appliances, cabinets, and dishes. Although the paper towel holder in the kitchen is under the sink next to the trash can that looks grimy...wouldn't want to use the paper towels for eating purposes after seeing them on the roll holder next to the trash in a closed dark space. Paper towel rolls seem to be better left over the countertop. Also the bathroom had very poor ventilation and after showering much moisture would build and drip from the ceiling and walls. We actually tried to open a window just to help dry the condensation on the walls. Maintenance was callled once for a clogged bathroom sink drain. Again they were very attentive but took about 40min to fix. The breakfast was decent we had one morning when it was great and the other two it was not as great. The drive to Sea World was very close, maybe 5-10 min. In end, the good attentive customer service, clean, and modern decor made this hotel a pleasant stay, one that could have otherwise been completely undesirable.", "Date": "August 1, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "1", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Service": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Washington State", "Title": "\u201cLots of Problems, Lobby looked and sounded like Day Care\u201d", "Author": "marycoug", "ReviewID": "UR115879259", "Content": "We recently stayed for a week and had a variety of problems.

Extremely close to attractions in or near the downtown area (not as convenient to North County, but take the Pacific Coast Highway and the drive is so beautiful you won't mind). It sits on a busy highway access road amid a cluster of other hotels and motels, so you'll need a car to get to shopping, dining and more scenic areas. Our room was newly renovated, quiet, bright and clean. When we reserved it, we made sure to specify a full wall and door between the bedroom and the living area, where our son would be sleeping on the pullout sofa (*very* grateful to the agent who told me that some rooms only have partial privacy walls between the two). That was a lifesaver in allowing us to stay up and read, chat or watch a movie after he went to bed. The bed itself was extremely comfortable. We didn't use the kitchen extensively, but it was equipped with all the basic tools to cook a full meal. We loved having the full-size fridge for snacks, drinks and takeout leftovers and a dishwasher to clean out water bottles, etc. The buffet breakfast is pretty standard (make-your-own waffles, eggs, cereals, pastries, etc.) - we ate breakfast in nearby Mission Beach a couple of times for a little more variety. On weekdays a light dinner buffet is available. We didn't sample most of it, although we did take advantage of things like cheese and crackers and carrot sticks to tide us over before heading out to dinner. The pool area is pleasant and includes a hot tub and grills. The onsite laundry facilities were a nice plus (bring quarters!) and meant that we could pack half as much clothing as normal, wash and re-wear. The only negative is that the pool and laundry room are both a little hard to access from some areas of the hotel; you have to figure out which elevators will and won't get you to the wing you need to be in. Fortunately, the front desk staff is courteous and helpful in pointing guests in the right direction. Do be aware that the hotel is pet-friendly, if allergies or other concerns might sway you.

We also asked for a hairdryer since the one in our room was not available, a staff brought it to us in less than 5 minutes. Courtesy call was nice to insure that we received what we asked for. I could not find any fault with the staff... better than most 4 star rated hotels we've stayed at. - Room was quiet. We were afraid to stay near the railroads like last time, so we chose this area to be at. It was pretty quiet, with the exception of some running from the lobby. There was some sort of basketball tournament in the area, and the hotel was filled with teenagers. But this didn't detract from how quiet the room was. - Another wonderful kitchenette. Bathroom was clean, bed nicely done. The only thing was the sink area.. right under the sink, there is a faux cabinet that it looks like someone tried to yank out before. No biggy, just don't touch it. We mentioned it to the staff up front. - Breakfast was very nice. More food than we could expect. Baby liked the scramble eggs. Good enough for baby, good enough for us. Con : There wasn't many things we can nitpick... but here are some - The sign is tiny. Residence inn is next to the Extended Stay. All the other hotels were easily visible, but this sign was tiny. - Pillow was a bit hard. This is more of a personal preference than anything, but still, the pillow was hard for me. No big deal, I don't really find it a fault of the hotel though. I just use some of the extra towels as pillows. - Parking stated $13 on one brochure when you check in. On the Map brochure of the hotel it says $10. Nevertheless paying for parking is blah. It's nice to have in and out privileges, but to pay extra for this is blah. Summary : We would stay here again.

If you have the time, I recommend that you take the time for the manager night activities on Thursday night, whether it is Karaoke, Poker, Bingo, or Smores on the fire pit, the hotel staff always makes sure the activity is fun and there is the potential for Marriott points to be won by the guests...Also, if you like to Grille, they have two that are available for guests. You just have to request use and they will supply the gas, spatulas, and even light it up for you. The hotel is also within walking distance to Old Towne San Diego and 15-20 minute drive to downtown or the attractions. I recommend that you check out the Cosmopolitan for a dressier dinner (best food in Old Town) or hit up Fred's or Cafe Coyote for the drinks and above average Mexican food. Just expect a long wait if going out on Taco Tuesday... Overall, the stay was the most fun I have had on a business trip in a long time. Every single person on the staff was courteous, professional and would also engage in casual conversations (often needed when out of town for a long period of time with the same 3 people).

They are upgrading the rooms throughout Spring 2011. The renovations did not impact me except that the contractors were using a number of parking spaces. The gym was closed during my stay, but they offer use of a nearby gym. Location: Hotel Circle South is a strip of hotels/motels. There's nothing interesting within walking distance and there isn't much of a view. You will need a car. On the other hand, the freeway is very convenient and the area is a short drive to Sea World, Old Town, Balboa Park/Zoo, shopping, and the airport. Downtown and La Jolla are also quite close. Check-in: Very quick; received early check-in without a problem (I arrived around 2 PM, not very early). Rooms: the 2-queen 1-BR suite is a generous size. The bedroom is crowded, with 2 queen-sized beds, but there is room for luggage; with the living room area, the whole suite is comfortable. The room was clean although it showed a little age (I was in an unrenovated room). In-room wired internet was free. It didn't work when I first arrived, but they had it fixed fairly promptly. The big problem was sound isolation. Although the bedroom door does a good job of blocking hallway noise, you can hear neighbors above and through the shared wall. Even a simple phone conversation is pretty clear. I've stayed in hotels with thinner walls, but not many. Unfortunately, there's not much the hotel management can do. They can only ask people to quite down if security can hear them from the hall and you can hear through the the shared wall better than through the two doors between the hall and the bedroom. The bed was comfortable and there were plenty of pillows. I can't report on the HVAC. I didn't need heat or AC while I was there (not unusual for San Diego). The renovations will update the technology (TVs, clock radio), decor, and kitchens (the photos of new rooms look nice). I don't think they're going to fix the thin walls. Breakfast: fairly standard fare: cereal, bagels, bread, eggs, breakfast meat, potatoes, make-your-own waffles. Hot food was mostly warm. I was pleasantly surprised by the selection of Tazo teas. Manager's Reception: I did not eat the snacks, but like with the teas, was pleasantly surprised by the selection of beer on tap. Parking: $10/day as advertised. From what I found, this is standard in the area. I knew I was going to pay it, but it's fairly disingenuous to charge for it when it's not really an option. There is no public transportation within easy walking distance. I understand the need to make a profit, but this is akin to charging for sheets. Pool: I did not try the pool or hot tub. Overall, this isn't a bad choice if you 1) need space for family, 2) have a car, and 3) can sleep through anything.

We search for places that have 2 bedrooms so my husband and I can have our own room when we travel with our 4 kids so we usually end up at the Residence Inn. The room had a great configuration for our family. One bedroom with it's own bath with 2 double beds. Pull out couch in the main room and a king sized bed in a separate room with a bath. It is far superior to having all of us stay in a regular room. The little kids can go to bed in one room while the teens watch tv in another and my husband and I can plan the next days adventures in our room. Perfect! I'll start with the positives. There is a full breakfast available every morning. The laundry room was never busy, even with a full hotel. We love the Marriott linens. We enjoyed the warm outdoor pool and hot tub every night. It was a clean hotel with a few exceptions. The location was perfect for the San Diego attractions. We were minutes away from beaches and the attractions. There was free internet (not wireless) and free printing (when it worked). The staff was friendly. The negatives? We did not know this was a pet friendly hotel. For over $300 a night with taxes, I don't want to sleep where a dog may have been the night before. We saw people bringing in big dogs, cages with strange animals, etc. There was pet hair all over the carpeted stairs. We would have picked a different hotel (the Homewood in Del Mar) had we known. The walls were paper thin. We could hear the guy next to us snoring all night and the parents upstairs dealing with their kids and I'm sure everyone could hear us. They charge $10 a day to park. What? It's not like there is an option because of the location, so basically it's an added room charge. I'd rather have them just figure that in. Our room cleaning was skipped one day for no reason and no credit given. No wireless internet. The breakfast had all the basics--scrambled eggs, toast, bagels, sausage, waffles, etc., but varied little day to day. When you are staying there for 7 days, you really hope to see some french toast, or pancakes, or variety with the cold cereal (only generic Cheerios and bran). The breakfast only lasted until 9:00 and from 8:15 on it was a ZOO! There was only one person filling items and she was nice and working hard, but it was too much for 1 person. There were many items I was waiting on every day. They also only provided whole milk and chocolate. No skim or 2%. I did get a carton of skim from the back room, but I had to ask and they never put more out for other people. The layout was terrible. The waffle line wrapped around the counter and people waited for about 20 minutes to make a waffle. Then to get the toppings, you had to interrupt the line and squeeze in bothering everyone. Bad layout! They should also put the coffee somewhere else because a lot of the traffic was from people getting coffee which could be avoided if they had that station in a different area. One day a lady got bumped and I had hot coffee spilled on my bare feet. Overall, if you have a large family, I would stay here. If not, I would go elsewhere. We like the Residence Inn brand.

There are only 3 chairs in the rooms for the tables so you have to move the desk rolling chair over for our family of 4 to eat together. Room was clean except the outside of the cupboards were nasty. On the positive side, hotel was in a great location for us. Our kids loved the heated pool and the towels by the pool. Breakfast was crowded but good every day. Evening snacks were tasty and drinks were good. Staff was very nice.

Each hotel received such varying reviews - everything from 1 to 5 stars - that I did not know how to choose. So, I chose this hotel (The Residence Inn on Hotel Circle in Mission Valley) because it was the least expensive of the hotels I reviewed. Here is what I found Pros: The toilet, sinks, shower, and counter tops were clean. The dishwasher, toaster oven, microwave and fridge were clean. The pool is beautiful. There is a hot tub. Breakfast (which ends at 9:00 AM) is included in the price. It includes eggs, pancakes, sausage, bacon, cereal, milk, juice, bagels, muffins, coffee, etc. It was very good for a buffet style meal. The kids suite has 3 rooms. Each room has a large T.V. and a very large window. Even though our windows overlooked the pool, it was very quiet when they were closed. Our room was right next to the elevator, but we didn't hear a thing (good sound-proofing). the kids suite had 2 beds in the kids room, a pull-out bed sofa and a bed in the master bedroom. Cons: The lower cupboards in both the kitchen and bathroom were filthy. There drips of various substances running down the doors. The bathroom was connected to the master suite so if the kids had to use it in the middle of the night, they woke us up. The fridge and freezer smelled horrible! I didn't even want to put any food in them. The bed in the maste rbedroom was uncomfortable and the mattress tilted to one side. No matter how many times I rolled to one side, I'd end up rolling the other way in my sleep. There were 2 metal bars sticking out at least 3\" behind the bedskirt of the bed in the master bedroom on the far/window side of the room. I rammed my leg into one and developed a HUGE bruise.

Not a big deal though. Hotel Facitilites: Free breakfast buffet each morning was good, about what you would expect from a hotel. We missed the evening reception that they have on some weeknights. Parking was $10 additional so factor that into your rate. The parking was gated and there was always plenty of empty spots to choose from. We didn't use the pools due to the weather, but they looked inviting nonetheless. The hotel is laid out a little strangely, so you have to walk outside in the middle courtyard to get to the lobby.

What can I say? I like free breakfast and having my own kitchen regardless of whether I end up using it or not. I used my rewards points for my stay, but also checked the online pricing, which was overall reasonable. Be advised that parking is $10 per night with in/out privileges. This isn't overall too bad price-wise as compared to staying in the Gaslamp Quarter, but if you were to stay a few miles down the 8, up the 5 or up the 163 parking would be free. I had a few complaints about this particular hotel: 1. My front stove burner did not work and a coffee carafe was slightly broken 2. The layout of the hotel is slightly confusing 3. There was only wired internet and no wifi. 4. I had to pay for parking As usual with Residence Inns, there is a business center and a workout room, as well as a basketball and a BBQ area. This hotel did have a larger pool area than usual with one large pool and two smaller pools. There is also a pantry area where you can buy some more groceries if you need to. This hotel seemed very family friendly (probably because its in Hotel Circle where most of the families go). There was a hotel reception (with free beer/wine) in the evenings, however, the snacks were all gone when I got there and there was a good 15 more minutes. Breakfast was good for a free breakfast with more than average hot items. There were biscuits and gravy, french toast, 4 do it yourself waffle stations, sausages, 2 types of scrambled eggs, oatmeal, yogurt, sliced melon, grapefruit, cottage cheese, bagels/pastries/toast, and lots of beverage options (juice, coffee, hot cocoa, tea, soda and including the more unusual horchata and orange bang fountain drinks). The breakfast area was very crowded and the staff was on-task keeping the food replenished. I will say that it was quite a zoo even though the dining area was sufficiently large. The hotel was smart enough to be situated a bit closer to the hill and thus away from the freeway, so there was no noise. The room was nice and the bed firm and unmemorable (which is a good thing). Location-wise it can't be beat: close to downtown, balboa park, the zoo, gaslamp, sea world and Mission Bay. It is also very close to shopping at Fashion Valley and Mission Valley.

We stayed in one of the Family Suites which means two actual separate bedrooms and one bathroom total. Normally when we have travelled with kids we have stayed at Embassy Suites. But for this trip we thought it would be good to try somewhere different and we do not usually have the option of getting a 2nd bedroom. The second bedroom was a great option since our toddler sleeps at 6 or 7pm every night. It enabled us to stay up with our older child in the other bedroom and then allowed a rest area in the living room once both kids were asleep. I read some previous reviewers' comments about sub-par breakfast food, flimsly closet doors and poor maintenance. There is some truth to these criticisms but, then again, I choose this hotel for its family friendly set-up and its proximity to Sea World. I was not expecting 5 star accomodations nor was I paying a rate which would command such expectations. I have to admit that the breakfast was not as good as Embassy Suites but \"inedible\"? I think that is a bit of an exaggeration. The breakfast served its purpose. The room was perfectly functional as far as we were concerned. I did have to lift the closet doors back onto its guide rails but it worked fine after that. Otherwise, everything else was fine: perfectly functional dish washer, 3 TVs with cable in each room; full refrigerator with freezer. Parking was a bit annoying since they charged $10/day. Most of the spaces are behind a access gate which only your key card will open but there were about a half dozen spaces in front next to the 15 minute registration spots. And there were the 'driveway' spots someone referred to. But I would think it is still Marriott property and technically they could still charge you to park there as well?

We chose the hotel for its price ($140/night during a holiday weekend), its proximity to Sea World and Balboa Park, and because it's a suite-style hotel. We've stayed at Residence Inns previously, and this particular location didn't disappoint. The best thing about the hotel are the rooms and the lobby area. The kitchen was very clean, fully stocked with utensils and dishes and glassware. The TV sizes and the Internet connection were excellent. The beds were pretty comfortable, although the bedroom was pretty cramped in size. The bathroom and vanity area were clean. The complimentary shampoo/conditioner/shower gel were of good quality. Our children loved the pool area. The temperature of the water was very cold, but it didn't deter most guests from jumping in. The pool towels were very threadbare, and the pool furniture was pretty dirty. They were minor irritants, however. The lobby is very large, with the standard adjacent dining area. This location has a cute kids' area with kid size stools and tables, and a TV for the kids to watch. The complimentary breakfast was not very good, compared to the other Residence Inn locations we've previously visited. The scrambled eggs were inedible, and the fruit didn't appear to be very fresh. However, there's always cereal/bagels/oatmeal as go-to choices, which helps keeps vacation costs down. The staff in the breakfast area wasn't very customer-service oriented, as I observed a few eye rolls in response to other guests' simple requests. The front desk staff, however, was very friendly and helpful. Check in was a breeze. We also requested towels for our room, and they were delivered to our room literally within minutes. The front desk then followed up with a phone call to see if the towels had been delivered. Our room also wasn't cleaned while we were gone during the day, but a quick phone call to the front desk to request housekeeping to visit while we were headed out for dinner led to a thorough room cleaning during the hour we were gone. Again, another follow-up call from the front desk when we returned to ask if we were satisfied with the service. This is what we'd expect from a luxury hotel, so it was a nice touch. Finally, we were surprised by the parking fee ($14/night). We gladly paid a parking fee at our hotel on the beach, a few days earlier, as that's understandable. But at a hotel on Hotel Row? The fee's a transparent attempt to nickel and dime the guests, and was not appreciated.

Also, the location is not close to down town, shopping, restaurants, etc. It's only walking distance to other hotels. For everything else, you need to drive. It's about 20 minutes from down town San Diego. Here's what we experienced at the Hotel Circle South location: - Air conditioner was VERY loud and had to be turned off when we were sleeping. - I was unable to bath our children in a tub full of water because the plug wouldn't \"plug\" the tub drain. We called to the front desk, they were unhelpful. - There was no dish cloth, no \"Do Not Disturb\", no dish soap and the wine opener was broken. I asked house keeping to deliver these items--they didn't. - The shower curtain liner is cut crooked with scissors and it's too short and doesn't reach the tub. Each day I had to mop up the bathroom floor. - I asked for another floor mat for the bathroom, a new box of tissue, a new paper towel roll and a different flavour of coffee (there were two bags of the same flavour) but didn't receive any of it. - The door in the bedroom didn't stay closed as the hinges were sagging. When we lifted the door on the handle side, then it would latch. - The dishes in the hotel's dining room are plastic/paper. This does not jive with the hotel's efforts for the environment (re. the note in the bathroom about conserving on water and not laundering the towels each day). They do not have food/bar service except for breakfast and the occasional BBQ with frozen burgers/hot dogs. Gross. And last but not least I have tried to call House keeping twice to ask about a lost item and no one has called me back, despite assurances by the front desk that my messages will be returned. It's been about 5 days since my last message. Also, I the photos on the web site aren't the photos of this location. The pool, lobby, dining room and I believe the front entry are all taken of another hotel. I don't make a habit of thrashing good reputations, but this hotel was the pitts!

I travel often and try to stay exclusively at Marriott properties since I am a Silver member and enjoy getting the Continental frequent flyer miles. I had a great rate (using AAA discount) for a one-bedroom suite (with 2 queen beds) - $152/night - not including $10/day parking fee which I think is outrageous since you have no other parking options). The rooms at this Residence Inn could be updated but suited our purpose which was to have reasonably-priced and comfortable accomodations close to the sights in San Diego (max. 10-15 minute, easy drive to Coronado Island, the Zoo, Sea World, downtown San Diego and Old Town). We were also a 5-minute drive to a very upscale mall with every store imaginable, a large movie theatre, and several restaurants. The hotel is along a road off of whch several hotels sit but there are no good restaurants within walking distance of the hotel and a car is a necessity. I rented a GPS from Avis (a Garmin Nuvi) and this was an invaluable resource for getting around the City. I highly recommend you invest in one or rent one if you are not familiar with the area. In terms of quality, I recently stayed at a newly-renovated Residence Inn in Chicago (near the Magnificent Mile) which was beautiful - very modern and chic. This facility cannot compare to that one in terms of furnishings, bedding, bathroom fixtures, etc. My arrival at this hotel was a bit bumpy. We arrived approx. an hour after the check-in time (which is 4:00) and our room was still not ready. After waiting approx. 30 minutes, I was given a room. We drove to the parking gate (you have to use your card to access the parking areas) and neither card worked. I returned to the reception area and was told the cards were working, but the cards were reactivated. Again, the cards did not work. As I was returning to the reception area, the manager was on her way outside to make sure the keys were working. To her credit, since I was very aggravated by this time, she helped carry our luggage into the room. Just after she left the room, I looked into the bedroom and realized we were placed in a suite with one king bed instead of two queen beds which is what I reserved. So, for the 4th or 5th time, I returned to the reception area and spoke to one of the agents (not the manager) who informed me that no other rooms were available that evening and we would have to stay in the room at least one night until another room became available. I asked to speak to the manager, the same woman who helped me previously and she was able to locate a kids suite for us to stay in (a two bedroom suite - one room with a king bed and the other with twin beds). We were able to stay in that room for the entire 5 days at the rate for the one-bedroom suite and the parking fee was waived. We had no other problems the remainder of our stay. The room was comfortable and clean and had everything we needed for our stay. My only complaint is that there is no door separating the sink area of the bathroom (which is located outside of the toilet and tub/shower) from the master bedroom. Therefore, you would disturb people sleeping in the master bedroom if you were using the sink. Also, even though we were in a kids suite, there was only one bathroom. Also, the heating unit in the kids' bedroom was loud at times. The pool area is wonderful and my 5-year old had a great time using it and the hot tub - as did many other families despite the chilly weather. I also used the laundry facilities which were clean and convenient - free detergent is available at the reception area. Breakfast is included with your stay which wasn't the best I have had at a Residence Inn, but had enough options that we are all satisfied (eggs, breakfast meat, potatoes, biscuits and sausage gravy, pancakes or french toast, cereals, fruit, yogurt, etc.).

They also have a small 1ft deep pool for the little ones. The pool got busy but never felt crowded. The breakfast was great with rotating pancakes/waffles/french toast along with usual eggs, meat, toast etc. Stuffing ourselves everyday before our long days at the Parks was really convenient, saving time and money.

I grew acustomed to the seperate and quiet bungalow style rooms that the older hotels offer, kinda gives you an at home feeling, well this hotel doesn't offer that style of rooms or feeling, it's one of those drag your bags for what seems like forever to an elevator down the hall and around the corner type feels, and with a family of four, plan on making trips. The rooms are very nice, full kitchen, and this hotel isn't short on amenities very nice pool, even though they say the pool is heated it isn't, anyone with small kids the wading pool is an excellent idea, the full breakfast is great, great staff. FREE internet NOW(used to cost 10 bucks a day) my only other gripes are the $10.00 bucks a day for parking. I could possibly see that if it was an open or shared parking lot, but it's a HOTEL ONLY private parking lot, so 10 bucks a day and anywhere from $180.00 bucks and up a night for a room,( i'm not a greedy or cheap person, paying that much i think that reflects that, there are plenty $60-$80 hotels all around this place) one would think the small amenities like the internet access (since they mostly cater to the business traveler) and DEFINITELY A NECESSITY LIKE PARKING YOUR CAR would be included, and last but not least the A/C. I don't know about all of you who reads this but to me A/C is a comfort, and it definitely helps me sleep better, well the selling point of most hotels is \"come on in,and get a good quiet nights rest\", well i don't know if this is a designer's flaw, or a marketing plot to keep their light bill down, but the main A/C operator(the one usually hidden in closets that you can't see or hear) well at this hotel it's located in the wall at the very foot of your bed(yes in the bedroom) so it's very disruptive and almost impossible to sleep with, therfore you will turn it off to go to sleep, thus resulting in lower operation, thus lower light bill (you be the judge) and you can hear the TV and people faintly talking in the next room over,but these are my only few disappointments. Now with this you may call be a whiner but i would like it if they transition like the other hi-end hotels and go to the nice flat plasma TV's. I would stay here again because i'm a long time fan, but i would first check for an older location near by first, the A/C is a real disappointment. Seaworld, zoo, downtown, and great restaurants are very close by making it a plus for location.

While checking in, an Engineer was nice enough to bring our 2 year old daughter a little stuffed animal of a whale to \"welcome\" her to San Diego. It was a very thoughtful gesture and indicative of the level of customer service we had for the entire stay. Even though they were very busy during the week we were there, the staff was super. The kitchen/living room and bedroom split with two kids under two years old was our saving grace. If one wasn't sleeping, we just went into the other room. We found that the \"fan\" option of the A/C and heating unit was great as a \"white noise\" machine. Except, without a bit of adjusting by my husband, then a hotel engineer and finally by (yes, a woman) me--- the air did not have a turbine air effect on anyone in the beds in the bedroom area - just lots of fan noise that my kids appreciated and blocked out everyone else's coughs, movements and noises in the hallways and even our room one foot away. My daughter, 2, especially loved the kids' pool. The hotel was awesome enough to think of putting inflatables in both the big and small pools. They even had a little area around one of the palm trees that my daughter lost herself in for over an hour after breakfast one day. The breakfast, by the way, far exceeds even Residence Inn, or even Courtyard standards. This is a FULL breakfast people! Pancakes, oatmeal, waffles, eggs, sausage, cereal, fruit, yogurt, the works. I was really blown away. We even had a great lady walk around one day with a cart full of kiddie cups and straws and juice for the kids. It was a thoughtful touch to what can be a hectic time of day. The whale statue in the lobby and the kids' corner that had a TV tuned into the PBS and Nickelodeon stations for Dora, Diego and other kid friendly shows during meal times.

However, with 4 free nights from our Marriott Rewards Visa (for a 2 bedroom suite w/bunkbeds @ over $300/night), my wife and I couldn't resist another attempt. After spending 4 days in Los Angeles, we drove down to San Diego and checked in. That went smoothly, and the manager, Tom (I believe) was very accomodating. We did request a room that was on an upper floor and facing outward toward the parking lot, since the noise from the pool kept us awake last summer (all rooms either face inward toward the pool or outward). When we entered our upstairs room, we were immediately greeted with a horrible smell. It smelled like something from the beach had died there! Since the room was warm, we thought that the air conditioning would remedy this problem, so we unpacked our 8 suitcases. Upon our return from a day of fun the following day, the smell again overtook us. Long story short... they had maintenance come up on 3 different occasions (once, the maintenance worker stuck a \"STICK UP\" behind our TV), and finally admitted that they were having problems with a drain in the building. Even the hallways smelled. In fairness to the hotel staff, they did, however, offer to move us, but with so much luggage already unpacked, we suffered through it. As far as the rest of the hotel, the breakfast was fine, as usual. Belgian waffles, eggs, pastries, oatmeal, fruit, etc... The manager's reception Mon. - Thurs. was okay, too. Nachos one night, burgers/dogs another, Mexican one night, and fettucine/salad, as well. This allowed us to save some money, and they had mac and cheese for the kids. Housekeeping did an okay job, all of the employees were very friendly, the pool was nice and this year, our plan to cut down on the noise from the paper-thin walls worked (stay on the 4th floor if you can - that way, you only have neighbors below you).

The Residence Inn is one of the newest hotels in Hotel Circle and we were very pleased we booked here instead of the other places we saw in that area once we arrived. This Residence Inn is nestled up against the hillside, off of the main road, enough so that we didn't hear any traffic noise whatsoever. Our first impressions were good considering the talk of the general Hotel Circle area and it being situated right next to 1-8 weren't very positive. However, it turned out we were in a great location in terms of getting to and from Old Town (which we loved!), Sea World, beach, banks, shopping, restaurants, etc. and we felt safe. We rented a car, which is necessary IMHO, so getting out and around wasn't an issue. We found it very easy to navigate our way around this area and San Diego in general. The front desk here was very helpful with directions and restaurant recommendations. Even printing out directions to any place we wanted to go. We arrived very early so our room was not ready...Not a problem. The front desk staff still checked us in, took our luggage, and gave us pool keys so we could enjoy the amenities. Nice pool and game rooms for the kids. Our requests for an upper level room overlooking the pool was granted. Our room was immaculate! Full kitchen w/ all the bells and whistles. Our maid even loaded our dishwasher for us one day, which I never expected! The beds were comfortable to us also. Note: the walls are thin and you can hear (somewhat faintly) conversations. The complimentary daily buffet breakfast and early evening snack and drink social was really good and a nice touch! I would recommend you get down to the lobby before 8:00 AM as the breakfast rush hits about then and the buffet lines are long and tables can become scarce. We are early risers so it wasn't an issue for us to get up a bit earlier to avoid the hubub. It was booked FULL with families & children of all ages when we were there and the pool also became packed by 3:00 PM every day. The pool area has a wading pool which is perfect for toddlers, an average size 4 1/2 ft deep main pool plus hottub. Our teens enjoyed it as we visited w/ other families around the pool during the evening socials. We did hang out one day on Coronado Island at the Hotel Del Coronado, which is beyond fabulous!!

Also near some decent malls. not too far from other major San Diego areas ( coronado island, La Jolla, petco park etc all within a reasonable car ride) Generally good for what it is but not worth the rates ( AAA rate of 249 plus that 10 bucks a night parking fee) Other were paying higher (319, etc) The whole hotel circle area is considered more reasonable and family freindly but for that money an extrea hundred a night might easily get you to a much nicer area if the budget allows.", "Date": "July 24, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "3.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cJust OK\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR5392591", "Content": "We just stayed one night at the Residence Inn San Diego Mission Valley/Sea World Area, June 24-25, 2006.

I have this image in my head of somebody at the hotel getting paid to sit at a computer and write reviews all day long! We've been bitterly dissapointed in the past. That was so NOT the case at the Marriott Residence Inn. We showed up about 6 hours before check-in time hoping they might have a room for us and they did. The free breakfast was great and they did a super job of keeping things clean even with a lot of little kids running around. Because there were a lot of people there for long stays, everybody seemed to treat the community areas more like they would their own homes and tended to pick up after themselves which helped too. My kids loved playing pool and pingpong in the gameroom. They also made good use of the basketball court and the pool. The laundry room came in handy too! The staff was super nice to us and the kids. They had tons of sheets of good directions handy to area attractions. When it was time to check out, they even printed out a mapquest route to our next hotel! Our kids' suite room was a very comfortable set up. The bunkbed idea is great. I don't know why more hotels don't do that! It was also great that they had a full compliment of dishes (and a dishwasher so I didn't have to handwash!!). They only thing I'd change would be to add an additional entry to the bathroom or another bathroom so the kids didn't have to walk through the masterbedroom to go potty. We got woken up a lot by the toilet flushing.

The previous postee was not kidding when she said they clean up your spills before you can say, \"boo\". My toddler spilled and they were there in a jiffy, they refilled our coffee and rushed over with more napkins when I was feeding my other child. They were on top of things and so nice. They made us feel so welcome. The food was very good but I was dissapointed there was no gravy for the bisquits. There is quite a selection though and chocolate milk for kids is quite a treat when you can take an extra one to put in the fridge in your room for later. The nightly manager dinner was nice too but we only made it one night. They had corn dogs one night with potato salad and green salad and drinks and then the second night was mac and cheese but we didnt make it back in time from seaworld and shopping. It can really help with the budget though if you have more than one kid! The arcade was nice but not free. The pool looked nice but we didnt have much time. There were some kids in there but not too many to make it look unwelcoming. The rooms-the bed was more comfy than the embassy suites in anaheim but not what I would call super comfy. The room was dark enough for us to sleep in and the doors did not creak to wake the kids when someone used the restroom which was nice. The room was VERY clean, the bathroom was great and the kitchen was the perfect size. We watched a movie one night (free HBO)and hung out and the living room area was not crowded (it's smaller than the picture appears). It was very relaxing to be in a clean, safe hotel with no traffic noise. We would stay again. The ONLY negative-narrow parking for big pickup trucks or SUVs and parking lot set up hard to get luggage to car since parking lot in back is up hill. If you have a compact car you can park closer and it should be fine. The parking anywhere in a big city is tight so what can we expect?

The suite was bright and fresh with ample room for cooking. Both the bed and the sofabed were comfortable, the bed exceptionally so, and for any sofabed to be comfortable is unheard of. Having fresh colors in the room truly made a difference from the same-ole'-blah-drab of most motel rooms - made it still restful, but a little more lively. The room was incredibly quiet - the motel is set back farther against the mountain from the road than most other of the motels there, and is quite soundly constructed. The only noise we ever heard was due to a funny indiosyncracy - when one first turns on the TV's they are set at a high volume and need to be turned down immediately. Other than that, all was silent, and drapes plenty dark enough to allow jet lag adjustment. I don't usually resort to caps, but the breakfast was OUT OF THIS WORLD! Here's what you get every morning, in a big, lovely, open, spacious dining area: soft scrambled eggs, seasoned potato cubes, either bacon or corned beef hash or sausage, toasty golden waffles you make yourself, a bunch of cereals and pastries and fresh fruit and muffins and english muffins and bagels, white and chocolate milk, several juices and pops, and a new thing for me - Japanese breakfast in the form of sticky white rice, miso and tofu and green onion broth to pour over the rice, and sprinkles you can choose to add of sesame or seaweed or shrimp. Plus, the extremely friendly and courteous staff roam around with refills of coffee in the most pleasant manner. Ah, yes, the staff. They were unfailiingly great! All were friendly, warm, knowledgeable, courteous, helpful and informative. When I couldn't find the breakfast room initially, they took me there. When I got cold and needed a blanket, it was there probably literally within one minute of my phone request. When someone spilled some orange juice, three staff appeared to clean it up and it was gone as quiickly as you could say \"splat.\" When I stopped the room service guy to ask about dinner, his English was admittedly spotty, but he made good eye contact, had a truly warm smile, and finally just directed me to ask the front desk, which was fine due to his good manner. And for glbt travelers, the quiet presence of queer staff was extra-nice. The only problem we had during the whole stay was that our key cards somehow got demagnetized a few times and the front desk folks were absolutely fine with us needing to have them re-keyed. The location is great, but this place stands head and shoulders above other Hotel Circle places we have stayed. It is very convenient for getting everywhere. Also, on Mon-Thurs, they have an early evening buffet, which means if you're staying during the week you get not only breakfast but dinner if you want it, and are there at the right time, which sure cuts down on the cost of meals out if that's of significance. It was \"May Grey\" for us, so did not try the pool or hot tub, but I expect these would also be topnotch. It was extra-nice to have a very tall showerhead that actually splashed over me instead of against me. I didn't try out the gymn or the kids' game room, but both looked good. And they had ping-pong! I couldn't resist that - it was great. And outside, basketball and volleyball courts. All in all, I think this was one of the most relaxing places I've ever stayed. No worries and a ton of amenities, all supported by superb staff. The only reason I didn't rate it \"excellent\" was just that it wasn't a sixty-star place - but then, it doesn't mean to be, and it is far more a place I want to stay because of that.", "Date": "May 15, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Arizona", "Title": "\u201cJust Fantastic!\u201d", "Author": "ttchamps", "ReviewID": "UR5014080", "Content": "Very nice place.

We stayed in a Two bedroom kid's suite. It was very roomy and quiet, three tv's, a kitchen & a living room. The only thing odd about the room was the bathroom was located through the Parent's bedroom (we had an infant that would nap in there and was disturbed anytime someone needed to use the restroom). I think our kids looked forward to returning to the hotel every evening just as much as the attractions we were visiting. There were many other friendly families there, all the kids played together. We participated in the evening reception on our last night and wished we had discovered it sooner. We had lasagna and salad and drinks (red & white wine, and a microbrew on tap). It was so wonderful not to have to head back out in the evening to find some food, we got to swim, relax, eat, and swim some more. They also have bar-b-que's available for anyone to use.
