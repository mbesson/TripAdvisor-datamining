{"Reviews": [{"Content": "A mixed beg I had a single room for 8 nights, for a negotiated rate of 45 Euro per night, including taxes and breakfast. I gave my review the title  A mixed beg  since there are positive and negative comments. Positive: great location in a central place but on a side street, the hotel is very clean, and the breakfast quite good. It is being served starting at 6:30 during the week. Negative: the single rooms are very small and the walls are thin. If the TV is played in the next room, one can hear it loud and clear. There is only one toilet on each floor and it is being used also for showers. It means that the toilet is often not free.  The mattress on my single bed was far too soft and I had to insert cardboard under the sheet to make my bed harder. One electric bulb in my room was burned out, and I had to remind the reception about it for three days before it was fixed. In short, this hotel is not suitable for everyone.", "Date": "Oct 14, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR593054489", "Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "2", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "Ishai6"}], "HotelInfo": {"HotelURL": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g187323-d617864-r20881016-Hotel_Charlot-Berlin.html", "HotelID": "617864", "Price": "Unkonwn"}}
