The hotel is only 10 minutes from a decent beach, several restaurants and cafes are close by, the train to Rome is a 15 minute walk. The hotel is dated, but the service is acceptable. The big issue I had with the hotel was that they took our passports at check-in and when I went back later to retrieve them, the clerk simply handed them to me without verifyin whether or not they were our passports. I asked for the passports for Room 128 and he gave me all of them without opening one of them. Later, when our room key stopped working, I walked up and asked for a new key. They asked which room, I said 128, and they punched in the code and away I went. Essentially, anybody could have taken our passports and anybody could gain access to any room without question.

Our carrier provided us a dinner which started and ended rather chaotic as about 200 hundred people were served by two or three waitress (it was buffet though). Same happened with breakfast.

We stayed two nights in three rooms. Our stays were consecutive nights but broken up by checking out on one morning, going to the airport (FCO) and rechecking in the same afternoon after not being able to travel on that day's flight (one flight a day from FCO - ATL - all of us flying on a stand by basis). The rate for a single room was Euro 83 - with the special tax - and Euro 111 for a double room - (airline employee rates). A free shuttle bus (30 minutes trip from airport to hotel) picks you up at FCO and takes you to the hotel. Our particular driver on our four different trips to and from the airport to the hotel was very surly and not at all helpful with our luggage. He was a decent driver (huge Greyhound size bus) but on one occasion was talking on his cell phone while driving - NOT a good thing to do. Yes, the hotel is showing some wear but the rooms were spotlessly clean, the lounge area nicely decorated and some of the staff were outstanding. We had a room that had a bathtub and an overhead shower, a king size bed and a small balcony. Only electrical outlet was in the bathroom but that was fine - just used for curling iron. Both elevators were small but worked perfectly. Our first night the hotel was almost empty but with an cancelled flight with Luftansia the second night the hotel did get busy. Breakfast was nicely presented in a large room with many choices. The coffee, tea and juices choices are from machines. Martin checked us either in or out as did Fabio. Fabio is to be complimented as to his handling of the 125 plus unhappy guest from the Luftansia flight. He had no other counter help and dealt with each guest in a professional manner. But the very best experience was on our first afternoon at the hotel. My husband was hungry, the restaurant was not open yet and the bartender - Eugenio - made my husband a toasted ham sandwich. We had a nice visit with him and appreciated him going out of his way to serve us. We also had a very good piece of some kind of cake. So thank you again Eugenio. The hotel is about five blocks from the beach area and the walk to and from has lots of choices for restaurants, gelato and viewing daily town life. Several small market areas and street vendors. Be sure an look up and around to see the beautiful displays of flowers on the balconies. One whole balcony was covered with some kind of flowering vine and when you walked by you could smell the wonderful blossoms. The beach area has a long pier and the promonade along the sea side was nice to stroll on. Again, many restaurant choices - fast food and sit down and bar type. Lido di Ostia was a nice quite change from the frantic and hectic pace of Florence and Rome. Over all, even though we did not plan on spending two extra nights in Italy, the Satelite Palace Hotel, was adequate for our extended stay.", "Date": "June 11, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Chicago, Illinois", "Title": "\u201cNo outlets?\u201d", "Author": "Brooke0410", "ReviewID": "UR89545118", "Content": "As a previous reviewer said this hotel offers good rates to American airlines whose passengers or employees get stranded and has a free shuttle to the hotel.

The hotel does have a small restaurant, but it is mainly for conference goers who have vouchers rather than normal customers who want to stop in for a meal. Didn't get to check out the area around the hotel because there were protesters outside yelling about one of the conferences going on in the hotel that night. The room quality was very disappointing. It was clean but the walls had a few light stains and were showing some wear. The TV was extremely small. There were NO outlets in the room and one in the bathroom.

The next morning, though, since I had to be at the airport at 7:30am and there was no heavy traffic, the shuttle got there in no time at all (I think it was even less than 20 minutes).
