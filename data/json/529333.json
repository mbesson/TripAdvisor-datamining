Plus you get a referral to a wonderful restaurant around the corner. ROOMS - some are recently refurbished. The carpet could use a good vacuum or a replacement. We had a room which wasn't up to scratch at all (smelled quite bad) and the Manager very kindly upgraded us. Also, watch that you don't get the smoking room. This was near us and it actually made the whole corridor smell when the cleaning staff were in it. Can't for the life of me understand why people continue to smoke ... MANAGER - He is what makes this hotel tick over so well - a true people person and great hotel management skills. Only having taken over on 1st September, you can see that this hotel means a lot to him and his staff and they try very hard to make your stay as comfortable as possible. PLUMBING - Oh dear ... well, the bidet and the sink hot water works very well and quickly, while the shower can take up to 15 minutes to warm up. This probably wasn't a problem in the summer, but in November it can be a bit depressing standing there waiting for a hot shower. I am sure it's not the fault of the Management or staff, but one thing that should be looked at very quickly. Also, the shower curtains aren't adequate in the room to keep water off the floors when showering. Adding a second shower curtain will fix this very dangerous problem and also it will be a quick, cheap fix. BREAKFAST - This was improving every day. It is as though they were experimenting each day with a little more food and seeing what worked. It is a standard European breakfast and quite filling. A few issues ... The coffee is horrendous. The coffee machine sometimes wasn't hot enough for our early morning departures so the cook made us some from the kitchen - much much better tasting. Get rid of that awful coffee machine or turn to simple dripolated coffee. Also the hotel served stale bread on Sunday morning breakfast. Perhaps there was a baker's strike that day? Not appetising at all really. OVERALL IMPRESSION: This hotel is excellent for a central place to do all the touristy things in Rome. I think Roberto Necci (new Manager) is dedicated and aims to please. He is fixing the hotel and bringing it up to speed as much as he can within I imagine budget allowances and time permitting. I'd go back because we were well treated, well fed and well housed.

Spoiled my vacations in Rome. Upon arrival, I was shown to a room that was smaller than the bathroom at home. The AC was not working and upon bringing it up to the front desk's attention, I was told that they were aware of the AC in that room not working for a couple of days and that I will have to \"put up with it for the night and they will see what could be done in the morning\". Mind you this was Rome in July. When I refused to do so, they got upset and told me \"this is creating a big problem for us\" and also that they did not have any other rooms available. Upon insisting that I should get what I paid for, they got me another room, claiming that it was an upgrade to a double room. Well, the room was in the basement with no windows, after a double bed there was no place for anthing else, and smelled of sewage. The shower stall had mould growing. The sewage smell was so bad that it made me nautious every time I entered the room. The TV was not working. Upon pointing these things out repeatedly, I was told that they will \"look into it\" and also that I had to \"connect the TV in the back\" and that I \"did not know how to turn the TV on\". Incidently since the room is in the basement with no windows / fire escape, I don't know how the building inspectors okayed it to be used as a rental property. I was so miserable that despite having paid for the hotel in advance, I looked up other hotels in Rome but could not find one as it was peak tourist season. I heard multiple people complain about their rooms at the front desk though don't know if their problems were addressed but do know that one gentleman asked to speak with the manager and was connected via telephone, with the manager insisting that he was not in the hotel at that time and could not help him till the next morning. It was a lie as I could hear the manager speak from the room right next to mine. I have travelled quite extensively around the world and have never had such a horrible experience in my life.

I don't think I saw one building there in the five days I was there that wasn't marred with ink or paint. Getting back to the hotel itself, Its clean but so was the Formula One and ETAP I stayed in Calais and Heidelberg. To say that the rooms at the XX Septembre are small is putting it very mildly. In fact the rooms in the other two motels above were larger albeit you had communal toilets/showers in the Formula One. We had rooms 306 and 307 across from the main lobby itself. Windows open to the alley and it has A/C but couldn't figure it out until the last night. Staff is very friendly and helpful, speaks decent English. Lots of places to eat but the location is away from most of the attractions in Rome. Breakfast wasn't too good... in fact ETAP had a better one. Small area for breakfast and you need to get there early for a table. Other websites claimed that XX Semptembre has room service but the rooms have no literature or menus. There are many other hotels closer to the tourist areas. Its only about .65 miles from the Hard Rock Cafe. One cool suprise was the open market that is on the back street everyday. As for taxi fare to and from the Fiumicino - Leonardo Di Vinci Airport... I paid 40 euros to the hotel and tip the cabby another 5 euros. When you come out from the baggage claim area, there is a sign that plainly says to take the white authorized cabs only. We were approached buy some gangster looking dude that offered to take us directly to the hotel in a large van. The catch is he makes you wait until he found two others to go into Rome. But that was for 15 Euros/person. Would have cost us 60 Euros vice 45 Euros I paid the taxi. That was on a Sunday afternoon... no traffic. Going back to the airport we had the front desk call a white cab and even through the Thursday afternoon traffic (pretty heavy), It cost 56.60 Euros and I gave the driver 60. I think you can find a better 3 Star hotel then this. Well XX Septembre should be a 2 star.", "Date": "April 24, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "1", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "1", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Moscow", "Title": "\u201cNot good\u201d", "Author": "Ayor", "ReviewID": "UR23546236", "Content": "Hotel is nice located, but..

Whenever we or those in 401 turned on the tap, flushed the toilet or heaven forbid had a shower the \"jack-hammer\" noise reverberated for ages after. Combine flushing the loo then washing your hands - unbelieveable! Tried to get a room change but was told there was nothing wrong with the plumbing and there was NO noise. Note the wardrobe doors rattle and the floor shakes when a bus goes by - hint.....leave the wardrobe doors open and you might get some sleep. The shower was also hanging off the wall and the shower curtain and grouting mouldy! There was no breakfast left at 9am the first day and the 2nd day it was busy so no spaces for 20 mins. They offered a taxi to the airport for e50 which i accepted but despite having been told where to go and telling him twice that he was going the wrong way we ended up at the wrong airport!!!! Fortunately we had time to double back and made our flight with 30mins to spare but it could have been a disaster. I gave him e50 and walked off - i wasn't paying any more for his mistake!!!

The taxi drivers will claim complete ignorance of any other language than Italian when they get to the airport, but I find that they understand one word very well: Carabinieri.

Something to be aware of, when we checked in, we were intialilly given a small room with very low ceilings (no more than 6 feet tall!!), but after I talked to the manager at the reception they were extremely accomodating and promptly gave us a much better room with 10 feet ceilings.
