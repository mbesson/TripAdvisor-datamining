The maintenance guy then pulled down the mattress and finally the sheets and comforter.

The housekeeping supervisor made up the bed but told me they had other rooms available and took me back to the front desk to ask for another room.

Second problem was that the room was hot--about 80 degrees--and neither the maintenance guy nor the housekeeping supervisor could figure out how to change the temperature on the thermostat. Even my new room had a couple of problems. First, the phone was dead.

Compared to other Wyndham's this one seemed to be lacking the full quality. The exterior is old looking, and almost as if it were a buisness park. The front lobby was small, and being with a large group of people made it even smaller. Also when we all came into the lobby, we were sent out into the cold by either a manager or front desk worker. They said there was not enough room, and until everything was set we would have to wait out there. After waiting for approximatley 45 minutes out in the 40 degree weather, our room accommodations we finished. The rooms seemed small, and the bathroom was extremely tiny! However, the beds were pretty comfortable, and the tv was nice. One disadvantage from being inside center city was the loss of a view. All we saw (and heard) was the traffic outside the window. The small coffee shop was nice in the front lobby, as that is where we ordered breakfast most days. During our stay it looked like there was remodeling going on, which in many parts of the hotel seemed necessary. The rooms on the other hand were pretty modern, and recently updated. They were also very clean, and the maids did a very nice job of tidying up the place. The wireless internet and plug in on the fourth floor was very slow, as it took me around 2 hours to watch a video and check my email. My advice for the hotel would be to give the outside a facelift or atleast a coat of paint, and have the staff a little more courteous when it comes to handling big groups of people. Also invest in some new wireless routers, or a speedier internet service for those on business trips.", "Date": "November 27, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Midwest", "Title": "\u201cA Nice Suprise\u201d", "Author": "RexGermanorium", "ReviewID": "UR120175454", "Content": "I booked a room in October 2011 as part of a conference.

First day - no morning paper but a stack was by the elevators. Second day - no stack by the elevators - had to go to front desk to find stack there. Soda machine only had one selection left in stock. Six TV stations didn't work and three were snowy. I stayed on the 4th floor. When I opened my shades all I saw were the tops of trees - no view at all. Ice maker had a sign \"broken use ice makers on 3rd and 5th floors\". Those didn't work either. Neither did the ones on the 2nd and 6th floors - I had to trek all the way to the bar and ask for ice (just this fact alone ensures I will never stay there again - I was attending a rather large convention in town and I am sure the hotel was near capacity - this should not have been an issue). Overall it is a business class hotel, which is what I expected, but not worth the business class charge per night I paid.

My biggest disappointment was that I left some jewelry behind in my room and it was never \"found.\" The hallway to get to our room was excessively long and smelled faintly of cigarette smoke, but our room itself was very nice and seemed recently updated. The bed was extremely comfortable and the room itself was large, although a little dark. The shower took several minutes to get hot water, but it did eventually warm up. We did the park and fly, as it is much cheaper than leaving your car at the airport. We came down to the shuttle 5 minutes before it was to leave, but it was already full. It would normally be another 30 minutes until the next shuttle, but the front desk was nice enough to have another shuttle get to us sooner. As I was going through security at the airport, I realized that I had left some jewelry in my hotel room. It was cheap jewelry from the mall, but it was my favorite. I called as soon as I realized (at 5:30 in the morning, only an hour after checking out) and the woman I spoke with said they would look for it and hold it for me until I returned. When we got back from our vacation, the woman at the front desk seemed irritated that I was asking about my jewelry. She called security to see if they had it, but whoever was working security did not have access to the safe where they store those sorts of things. I gave them my phone number to call me when they found it. Three days went by, nobody called me, so I called and was transferred to security where I left a message. 2 days later, they returned my call to say that they couldn't find my jewelry. I knew exactly where I left it and I highly doubt housekeeping had gotten to my room by the time I called, so obviously nobody cared enough to hold onto my jewelry for me.", "Date": "June 10, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Hamilton, Ohio", "Title": "\u201cVery comfortable and clean!\u201d", "Author": "wrenchgal", "ReviewID": "UR112445607", "Content": "Wonderful night spent here!

Arrived at airport and called for shuttle at 5 after midnight to which a rather rude woman answered the phone and told me I needed to get to the right pick up spot (not explaining how to get to it). After waiting 40 minutes I called the hotel and recieved no answer. We then realized we were in the wrong spot and walked quite a ways to the correct spot and called the hotel back. They were very nice at this point and sent the shuttle to us. Upon arrival to the hotel it seemed something was up. The woman is staring at her computer as I stand there and wait (only person in lobby) she then tells me it will be just a minute and goes to talk to the woman in the back room and comes to tell me they have a situation. well, the situation is it is Indy 500 and they had overbooked and had no rooms. I had booked and paid for this room months ago! Nobody mentioned this when I called from Philly! They informed me it had been a rough night ( hello, what about my night) and they had to place people as far away as bloomington (no clue how far this was away and didnt really care). I remained call but had been up and traveling since 5 am in another country and told them I really needed a shower and a bed. they did say due to the hour they did find me something but it doesnt have a tv. I said that is fine as we really arent going to be turning a tv on. well, i will now discribe the room. first, the keys didnt work because this isnt a room they use for people. they gave us keys but luckily security caught us in the hall and informed us they won't work. This room was at total other side of building, maintenance vacumming room upon arrival. supposed to be 2 beds but has one double bed and not the same beds we slept in a week ago. sitting on a wood base that can be seen. No cozy pillowtop thing. They did bring a scarey looking rollaway bed in with no blankets. No pillows in the room. When I called the front desk to ask for pillows and blankets she stated \"maam, we are totally booked, we don't have any pillows\". I then states this is ridiculous and hung up the phone and got in the shower. while showering they brought a blanket in but no pillows. We then all 3 went to bed with no pillows, alarm clock, trash cans, coffee maker, tv or THERMOSTAT. After laying in the bed the phone rang and I did not answer it, my gosh we are EXHAUSTED! About 20 minutes later someone knocked on the door for several minutes. ok, I know you might not want to know this but we brought in close for the next day and I admit we were all sleeping naked. Do you really want me answering the door at 2:30, 3 am in the morning naked and no way am I answering it. About a half hour later more knocking. They had given us 3 free breakfast buffet passes that we could use till 10 am but hello, we were sleeping. We got up and threw cloths on and gave our keys and passes back to the front desk. They did question us not using the passes like that would make everything better. when I mentioned the pillows she stated well, they did try to bring you some in the night. I said we were sleeping! They had borrowed 2 from another hotel.So, which person doesn't get a pillow. I am not impressed and yes everyone I know has heard this story in person, phone and facebook. It is so disappointing and I am upset the the staff didnt seem very upset by putting someone in this situation. So, I paid full price for this place!!!! Crazy!

I was exhausted and frustrated when I arrived, after a long plane ride. After checking in and getting settled, I immediately went to the bar for a glass of wine. Not only was I greated with a smile by the bartender, when I asked for a specific wine I was immediately introduced to a wonderful man(DAVE) , the somalier,who told me all about their wines and led me to a great wine. It was just what I needed after a long day. I got up after a terrific night sleep. The bed was very comfortable. The only issue I had with the room is that I couldnt get the temperature regulated. It was either hot or cold. That morning the staff was very busy, I saw one man in particular that was greating people, making sure the hotel van was at the door for a group of pilots and air line attendants and then later I saw him in the resteraunt waiting tables. I thought my job was taxing. I had the pleasure of meeting this man at the end of my trip. I must have looked confused because the man who was doing everything the morning before asked me if I needed assistance. I almost forgot that I was in Indiana because he had a great southern accent with southern manners. I had been looking for a news paper ( you dont automatically get one at your door, that was a bummer.) Bill, who I found out was the General Manager , and the man doing about 5 jobs at once, went and got me a newspaper for my flight home. Between Dave and Bill ,they are two very good reasons you would want to visit this hotel ( The beds are nice too). I wish every somalier and general manager were so nice. Usually General Managers walk around just saying Hi and smiling. Bill was friendly and he was helpful. Dave was informative, friendly and pleasant to talk to. I have two suggestions, please add some healthy meals(alternatives) to your menus. It is very hard to eat well when traveling. Many hotels are trying to help by adding lower calorie alternatives and meals. Also, is there anything you can do about your prices for food, they are high.

The hotel parking lot is quite large and is seriously lacking adequate lighting. I'm a middle aged man and a big guy. I felt a bit uncomfortable walking from my car to the hotel entrance. The darkness doesn't stop there either. I entered my room and it was DARK. Really, really dark. There were no light switches on the wall near the door.

I must say that once the lights came on, I was impressed on how large the room was. Neat, clean, and big. Nice. 2nd - The attached restaurant was a huge disappointment. Service was miserable. They ended up getting 2 of the 4 things I ordered wrong. My soup never came. The waiter seemed more concerned with socializing with his colleagues than servicing his tables. When I mentioned the discrepancies with my order I was told I wouldn't be charged for the items missing and that was it. No apology, no discount, no nothing.

That state wasn't helped by knowing that I had to be at the airport the following morning at 4:00 am in order to catch my re-assigned flight. The fact that the Wyndham Indianapolis West turned things around for me says it all. First, I obviously arrived with no reservation, expecting to get a standard room with two double or queen beds. The woman at the desk was friendly, professional, and I was delighted to find that I had a king bed with a mattress that was like a little bit of heaven. The rooms was smallish, but very clean, quiet, and well laid out. I used the shampoo and conditioner when I showered - something I rarely do, being very fussy about hair products - and I was surprised to find they were actually good! Already, I was happy to be at the Wyndham. I ventured down to dinner, airline food vouchers in hand. The hotel restaurant had a buffet (this was a Friday night) that was excellent and very well priced. For just under $20 there was a sizeable salad bar, a variety of entrees, and a number of side dishes to choose from. The waiter suggested trying the dessert (included in the buffet) and the cheesecake was really excellent. If I had the cheesecake first, I might have gone for a dessert-only meal, since the other choices looked just as good. I have to note that this isn't a buffet with endless mediocre dishes. Instead, the selection is quite good and attention to quality is obviously a high priority. To top it off, when I asked for a desperately needed glass of wine, I was introduced to the sommelier. At an airport hotel! This gentleman was clearly knowledgeable about wines and happy to share information about the choices. I dropped off to sleep on that lovely mattress, having verified that a shuttle would be available at the ongodly hour of 3:30 am. Guess what? The shuttle was right on time and got me to the airport without incident. I travel often for business and pleasure, and have stayed at a wide variety of expensive properties in cities and at destination locations. For friendly service and a host of unexpected and most welcome bonuses, the Wyndham is a place I would return to if I ever need to stay near the Indy airport. My advice? If you think your airline is going to leave you stranded, try to get to Indianapolis and insist on the Wyndham!

This city is a great location for this type of event. Unable to get a reservation in a downtown hotel, we made a reservation at the Wyndham just as a back up while still hoping for something downtown. Finally on check in day I called the Wyndham to verify cancellation time. The agent I spoke to was so helpful (Allison?) that I really questioned whether or not to spend an additional $120-$180 per night more for downtown. So, at the last minute we decided to keep our spot at the Wyndham. Check in was quick, parking free. I believe that the hotel was near capacity, but did not seem crowded or hectic. The room was nice and clean and quiet and the bed very comfortable. Free wireless internet was much appreciated, as was the nice flat screen TV. We did spend a lot of time in downtown Indy. Our commute to and from the Wyndham could not have been easier. A quick walk to the car and easy on and off the expressway and we were there--10 to 15 minutes and we were right in the middle of the action. The only negative was non-functioning ice machines at the far end of our floor and the one below. Did get ice two floors below. I thought maybe they were just overtaxed due to the fullness of the hotel, but they didn't work the next day either. Other than that one problem all was great!!", "Date": "April 11, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Kansas City", "Title": "\u201cPerfect End to a busy Weekend\u201d", "Author": "courtcro", "ReviewID": "UR59915609", "Content": "I had just finished a tiring weekend of volleyball downtown, and my mother and I were looking to find a hotel with easy access to the airport with good rates, and somewhat luxurious.

We did, however, order pizza from the restaurant, and it was probably one of the best pizzas I had ever eaten. It was reasonably priced too. The best parts were the beds.

Late Monday afternoon on October 25th, Leroy picked us up at the Indianapolis airport. We were tired after a long, multi-flight trip from Seattle. Our spirits were lifted immediately, however, by Leroy, a warm and friendly man who mentioned that this was his last trip of the day. He said he was particularly looking forward to going home that evening because his daughter and grandchild would be there, and his daughter was preparing a special dinner for the family. When we arrived at the Wyndham, my husband realized that he had left his brief case, which contained his computer and car keys, at the passenger pickup area. Without hesitation, Leroy informed his boss about the situation and immediately decided to make another run to the airport. \u201cWhat about your special dinner?\u201d we asked. \u201cOh, that\u2019s not as important as you getting your brief case,\u201d Leroy responded with a big smile. Upon arrival at the airport, a person in the pickup area told Leroy that the brief case had been found and turned over to airport security personnel. They had already taken the bag to a safe place, opened it, found my husband\u2019s business card, and were attempting to get in touch with him. So we ended our trip, being very thankful to recover our bag and for an incredible man named Leroy. We commend him for his kindness, thoughtfulness and extraordinary customer service. We hope you will, too!
