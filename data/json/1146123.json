It's an easy location to get to most places in Spore as its right next door to Somerset MRT. The quality of accommodation is very high, the service is faultless and the suites are serviced daily (except Sundays). The suites do cost more than others, but there is wireless included, use of business suite, excellent facilities and a good hearty breakfast in the morning. If I had one complaint, it would be that they only serve dim sum for breakfast once a week! I am sure that this is to cater for their multinational guests.

Thank you! - just next to underground and of course the Orchard glitz, also supermarket across the road. Not dislikes, but some points to remember: - cannot open windows. - on the expensive side. Of course, Singapore is expensive, and I think that they are the only apartments with kitchen which are modern, in a good location and of high standard. Just expect what you pay for, not the superb deal. - \"Executive suite\" is quite small as you have no living room... but the setup is quite ingenious. - Pool: cold water (sorry people: I am a bit of a spoiled brat who likes warm pool). - You must book one week at least, and you have some formalities to complete before you can book the room (sending credit cards copies, etc...)... OK, fair policy, just be prepared.

I booked for a two-bedroom executive suite but when I reached my room on the 16th floor to find out that I was upgraded to a penthouse, my impression was that the reception staff managed the shortage of rooms very quickly and promptly, I was in bliss to discover a fully equipped kitchen and gigantic living room. The stay gets more personalized from that point on, every request of mine was met with courtesy, from requesting a privacy curtain for the master bed's bathroom, to fix the lighting on the stairs to directions, the service was efficient--and with a smile. The service is the epitome of smiles in this hotel, there's a personal assistant who assist you up to your room and show you how things work in the room, making your transition , be it short or long term stay, a total enjoyment. The gadgets are all high tech, and i loved the Molton Brown bath amenities. Massive room space made luggage space not a problem-- whereas this was the problem in most other hotels at the same price tag. The return airport transfer when we ordered a taxi was made in a van with its own tv and price? only a reasonable SGD40, perfect indeed! It doesn't stop there, the superior breakfast that i looked forward each passing day cannot be more relaxing. The buffet offers a small variation...but you can also order items ala carter (eg. sunnyside up), the food quality were top-notch and cannot be more perfect for a long stay or a short stay alike. However, there are minor faults, but these faults are mainly to do with the original design of the suite. The master bedroom needs a sturdy curtain as it can reveal a part of the person in the toilet and the person bathing. The bathtub is very slippery, the door that separates the toilet and the bath is design defying, when opening it it hits the toilet ( this fault can be seen in many other hotels in singapore, but I had not expected such in a serviced apartment). Other than that, everything is perfect. Thumbs up to the serviced suite, you guys have done more than a fine job, thanks from Khanh and family.", "Date": "August 7, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Copenhagen, Denmark", "Title": "\u201cIf you want the best, go for Pan Pacific Serviced Suites\u201d", "Author": "Velter", "ReviewID": "UR102770041", "Content": "I am travelling to Singapore for Business approximately 6 times a year. If you are planning to stay for at least 7 nights, you should definately consider the Pan Pacific Serviced Suites if you are looking for 5 star accomodation. I have now tried it twice and both stays have been excellent. I find the hotel quality in Singapore to be very high compared to other cities and there is plenty of options, but nothing quite beats the PPSS. First of all the suites are contemporary designed and very convenient, both for leisure and business. You will immidiately see that only high class materials are used, you get truly high speed internet, everything you need of TV programmes as well as features you wouldn't get at the standard business hotels like kitchen, washing machine/dryer etc. And you dont need to consider paying extra for anything. Water, coffee/breakfast, papers etc is available for free. You get an appartment - not just a suite...so are you tired of the endless identical business rooms, here is something different and better. Probably the best thing there is to say about this place is the service you get: The staff in reception somehow know you by name - and welcome you back...even if your visit was many months ago. Yes, the service is generally speaking good in Singapore hotels, but I feel you get the perfect blend of hospitality and privacy. To most travellers the location is perfect. Right on Orchard Road and just a few steps to a taxi lane and Somerset MRT. Personally I don't fancy the Orchard Road shopping hell, but as soon as you step indoor, you have a completely private and quiet stay. I am trying to find out something negative to write...I just can't think of anything.

Liked: -while making reservation, I asked for a room at garden level and away from the construction work (there`s one going on next door). They gave us one exactly per request without us mentioning it again while checking in. -the room interior design is sleek but the size is abit too small, with all the high-end equipment and utilities provided. -the front desk ladies staff and the breakfast lounge guy staff were very friendly and helpful. Even one lady (I think she`s our assigned PA) immediately ran out from the lobby to help us carry the stroller up the main stairs. We were asking for lots of bottled water, and the next day they continuously providing us with lots of it without being asked. -the housekeeping lady fold our piled up dried laundry, and also managed to rearrange my kid`s messy toys by the window. -I left behind my wallet somewhere in the room and emailed the staff about it, they were very helpful and communicate continuously, although couldn`t find it back. Disliked: -Dust!!! The room was extremely dusty (we stay at room 315), my husband could not stop sneezing while we were there, I never saw him sneeze that badly. I don`t know when was the last time they cleaned up the shelves, carpet, etc. When I place stuff on the higher shelves, poof! all the dust were flying up. Even when I looked under the kitchen cabinet to pick up something, to my Horror there`s a line between a never been cleaned dusty floor and a cleaned part, there`s even a quite big rubber toyball (don`t know who`s) sitting there. And there were food crumbs on the carpet too. Beware if you are allergic to dust or traveling with young children. -the amenities at our room never been replenish, we have to keep asking for it which was not delivered (is it because we asked for it at night?), and have to ask for it again the next day. -the swimming pool is wall to wall to next door construction work, it was a very disappointing environment, not due to the noise but due to lack of fresh air and good view. -Breakfast could be a boring experience with almost the same choices everyday.
