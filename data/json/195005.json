We had visited Florence before and were really looking forward to our stay. We booked the Villa Cora because it has a pool and was close to the town centre AND because it was meant to be a 5 star hotel.1 Really unfriendly staff. I dont think the staff on the front desk liked to be disturbed. Most of their answers were monosyllabic and never with a smile. We never got a good morning or good evening from any of them.2 Hotel had its day. The Villa Cora used to be grand I expect. Now it appears run down and old. You have to eat all your meals by the pool in a sperate building. The main hotel building only has bedrooms. They do provide meals in the main hotel but only for visitors not hotel guests. The water from our shower ran across the bathroom floor. Everyday we had to put towels down to soak the water up. Probably a legitimate health and safety issue. The hotel also smells musty and looks a bit like a furtuniture stock room.3 Breakfast. The breakfast was very average and compared to a hotel we stayed in this Summer for a third of the prize. The staff at breakfast like the staff at reception really couldn't be bothered.I could go on but I hope you get the idea.

My partner and I thought that the Hotel was beautiful - we were given a fabulous room with a stunning view over Florence and the pool was a wonderful and relaxing relief from the museum/gallery circuit of Florence in mid-summer.I would agree that the staff are not overwhelmingly friendly, but nor did I find them rude or unhelpful. Basically they left us alone unless we requested assistance - the rooms were cleaned throughout the day without any inconvenience to us; the pool staff were always helpful and I have no complaints about the advice given by the front of house staff in response to our queries. It was a relief to not to have to interact with the staff unless we felt we needed to. My partner and I were perfectly relaxed wandering through the Hotel in shorts/t-shirts after a day by the pool.The only downside to our stay was the price of the restaurant. We largely avoided this by planning our meals south of the river (about a 20 min walk).

(February 2006) We visited my daughter in Florence and chose the Villa Cora over all the other 5 star hotels in Florence. There are many worthy of note. We chose the Villa Cora because it is located on the other side of the Arno in a residential setting. I had heard from my daughter that the city can be loud and overwhelming. We enjoyed the setting and the view very much. In the morning we could look out over the the city and at night the lights were twinkling below us. The hotel itself is the historic home of Napoleons sister and is very grand yet subdued. The staff were very attentive and the only disagreement that we had was that the car from the train station was not included as I had believed. The hotel has a car and will drive you to a pick up point where you can then walk to everything in the city. The hotel car is not allowed to drive guests around the city because the taxis think it's unfair competition. I do not understand that at all but that's the way it is. The room was beautiful (a junior suite) but the other rooms were drop dead gorgeous. We were there in the off season so there were very few guests and we were glad of that. I guess the city can get insanely crowded. I would definitely recommend this hotel. The restaurant was superb and they made a huge fuss over my daughters 21st birthday.

It is very hard to find fault with the Villa Cora. It is a beautiful hotel in a beautiful setting, and after a day walking the hot and dusty streets of Florence there is simply nothing better than cooling off in the fabulous pool, surrounded by greenery. Ignore the prices advertised on their website - we e-mailed the hotel direct and were offered a delux double for \u9227?50 per night, B  B. On arrival we were upgraded to a senior suite - a nice surprise and a great room. Having read other reviews on this site, I doubt there are any bad rooms, but would certainly ask for one in the main villa. Breakfast was perfect, served by the pool. Location is great - away from the madness but close enough. Very quiet at night. Shuttle service is useful (but why not at the weekends?) and failing that taxis can be summoned in minutes with one phone call - average cost \u9227?-10 and only 5 mins into town. So where does it lose marks? The overall impression is that you are staying in someone's grand country residence, but they have gone away and left their staff to look after you - and most are more than happy to do so. Previous reviews refer to variable assistance at reception, and they were spot on. On the first evening we asked if there were any very local restuarants we could go to for supper - the answer was a flat no! He wasn't wrong (there aren't) but he could have been a little more helpful - intead we asked the pool guy who gave us two great suggestions within 20 minutes walk, where the locals like to eat. Other gripe is with the bar prices - 2 soft drinks and a bowl of nuts at the pool came to \u9227?0! Even for a city like Florence that must be close to a record, or am I just naive?
