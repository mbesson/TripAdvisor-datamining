There was a flat screen on the wall in the living area and the bathroom was very clean and new. The only downside were the beds. They weren't the most comfortable and the bedding could use some updating. But the bedding was clean, so it didn't bother me so much. The service at the hotel was great! The staff were all so pleasant and easy going. They also let us check in a little early since we were there and our room was ready. I also appreciated the coffee that was set up in the lobby in the mornings. Now, for the best part, the location!! What a little treasure, that this hotel is right on the beach!! We opened the windows and listened to the waves crash every night! It was so relaxing. Now be aware, that this IS oceanfront property, but it's cliffs, not beach sand. Don't expect to walk out of the hotel onto a sandy beach and lay out. If that is what you want, there's a beach, with access, a few blocks down. For us, this was not a problem at all. In fact, it was better because you aren't dealing with all the hustle and bustle from the noisy people at the beach, right outside your bedroom door. We loved the location and the quaint town that is Ocean Beach! What a great change from chain hotels and chain restaurants. I encourage you to visit and support the local businesses. Good news is, all the great attractions that San Diego has to offer, is still very conveniently located just minutes away from The Inn at Sunset Cliffs.

The windows to your suite were priceless as they were huge with terrific access to the water views and ocean air/sounds. Friday night at 11:30 pm someone at the wedding facility cranked up two generators right outside of our window to turn on some flood lights also right outside out window. There were people staying underneath us who were partying and shouting from their hotel window to the people over the fence at this place. This did not go on too long but it was enough to ruin our $300 per night hotel room stay. We put on the room's a/c and that helped us to go back to sleep. Saturday at 4pm the wedding started and we just rolled out eyes as we were trying to relax in our room. It lasted until 10 pm.

Gardens are lovely. Pool is small. Rooms are redone aged motel. Beds are good quality. Culture of the staff is that it is incumbent upon the customer to tell them what they need when there is a problem and not incumbent upon the staff to initiate or be energetic/enthusiastic about solving the problems. And the problems I experienced were EGREGIOUS: the floors were dirty, found a long black hair on my pillow, the showerheads were not adjustable and spewed strong water horizontally across the shower, three piles of dog poop on the lawn outside our room went unpicked up for a day, the closet smelled moldy (the only place to hang the designer dress I'd bought for the wedding I was to attend!), the pricey ocean-\"view\" room did face the ocean but could not be seen from inside due to the small high windows AND the stairway that was adjacent to the windows (everyone upstairs walked up and down these stairs looking directly into my room!), and FINALLY THE WORST: when donning the bathrobe in the morning to head to the pool, I found an unwashed pack of used matches in the pocket: THE BATHROBE HAD BEEN WORN BEFORE AND NOT WASHED FOR MY STAY!!!! ICK. The staff responded to this extremely casually, did wash the robe and return it to my room, but NEVER offered to compensate me in any way. When talking with the manager the following Tuesday (first chance to catch him and I had to initiate the call even after an email to him delineating the problems!), he also was extremely casual, never offered to comp a night or offer me a free future night (traditional hotelier solutions), but went on at length about how he agreed with the items that were problems and how he'd fixed them or would fix them. NEVER ONE WORD about me the customer, about fixing my negative experience with him. When I finally said something about how cavalier they are and that any other hotel would offer me a comped night, he became extremely passive-aggressive and said that had I asked him for this at the outset, he would have comped me a night, in fact he would have comped me the whole weekend AND given me a future stay for free; but now that I was a bad customer (what?! I listened to him drag on for 20 minutes about his hotel!), he would not do a thing for me and in fact advised me that I was banned from his hotel. ROTLFMAO. Like I would EVER return! I then advised him that this was the problem with the staff culture at the hotel: they think it's incumbent upon the customer to pay them AND to advise them how to perform. I advised him that in the hotel industry it is, in fact, incumbent upon the hotelier to serve the customer who is paying them. So if you stay here be sure to 1. bring up every problem you have immediately with the staff when you discover it and have them fix it asap and maybe comp you a night if you have the seriously disgusting problems I had and 2. be sure to never indict the staff for their laissez faire attitude and responses or you'll get blamed for being an inadequate customer.", "Date": "April 13, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Peoria, AZ", "Title": "\u201cJewel in San Diego\u201d", "Author": "liftedhummersut", "ReviewID": "UR61031450", "Content": "Upon arriving to the hotel we were greated by friendly staff as well as taking in the amazing views offered including beatiful gardens and breathtaking sunsets.

Overall, it was a really great weekend away and we would stay here again. Here are some comments/observations from our stay. View: Beautiful!!! The inn is located right on the cliffs and every room has some sort of view of the ocean. The rooms are located on top of a small cliff and there is nothing obstructing your view north towards Ocean Beach (and beyond) or south. This is the reason we liked this hotel. I don't think there is any other hotel in this price range that even comes close to this one in San Diego (and maybe anywhere in SoCal). Room: We booked a Poolside Queen room, but since the pool was under construction, we were upgraded to a Two Bedroom Suite on the second floor 3 rooms from the ocean end of the north wing. The room was adequately furnished and clean. The bathroom had a dual head shower which was a nice touch and you could look out the shower window and see the ocean. Not quite as cool as an in room hot tub (like the Presidential Suite) but better than nothing! Definitely request a room as close to the water as possible and on the second level for the best view for your buck. Ammenities: Well, the pool was closed when we were there but it was still a little chilly anyways. The \"breakfast\" was pretty sparse; fruit, mini muffins, bagels, coffee and Sunny Delight. I think they are supposed to serve Belgian Waffles on the weekends but they definitely didn't when we were there. A small disappointment because I was looking forward to those. The wireless internet didn't seem to want to work for us (I think their router might be broken) but they have a computer in the lobby that was available to use for free. They have firepits! They have wood and lighters available for you to make your own little bonfire on the lower deck right next to the ocean. We made two fires while we were there and it was a really fun experience. Service: No complaints, everyone we met was nice. However, do not expect the service you might be used to from a higher star hotel. But for the price you shouldn't expect 4-star service. It's mostly college-aged kids working the front desk. Our rooms were cleaned and no complaints with the housekeeping. Out and about: We went on a walk south of the inn along the cliffs. There is a trail that runs along the cliffs for quite a ways. I think this is one of the most beautiful areas in all of SD. We ate dinner one night in Point Loma at Miguel's Cocina. It is affordable Mexican food with expensive, watered down margaritas and a really great queso dipping sauce that is complimentary and comes with warm tortilla chips. The next night we went big and went to Piatti's in La Jolla. It is a nice Italian food restaurant. Definitely request a seat on their patio, it's really pretty. This is my favorite restaurant in SD.

The worst was the bathroom. It was very small with no counter top to lay out your toiletries (although there was a cupboard over the toilet with some exterior shelves), plus the water pressure was so strong that it stung the body. Adjusting it to less pressure meant cold water (the warmer, the stronger). Also the shower head went from gushing to needle-like. Bad if you get sunburn. The staff was very pleasant.

The room I booked was a 2 bedroom without a kitchen for 4 adults. The rooms are very clean, and it's right on the ocean so it's a good choice if you like to be able to open your window and fall asleep to the sound of the ocean splashing against the rocks. At check-in I was a little annoyed that the hotel owner was trying to tell me I had booked two identical rooms for 2 nights and not one. I needed to provide evidence from my hotel reservation to show that was incorrect. I did feel like possibly they were trying to take advantage of me since i was traveling with 3 guests and perhaps they thought i would take the extra room (which would have been an extra $550). The hotel has 2 floors and if you are on the 2nd floor and have a lot of luggage it may be a bit difficult to get it up the steps, and open the heavy locked gate with your key (can't just leave key in the lock like it says on the sign, must insert and then pull out). The rooms are nicely decorated (tile floors, tile bathroom and shower with 2 shower heads) but the couch and chairs in the living room are painful to sit on for long periods of time. I did manage to read a good book though in the bedroom during my stay. The beds are just OK, nothing special but not too bad. There is a small gas station and deli next to the hotel but other than that there isn't much nearby besides the ocean/cliffs since the hotel is in a residential area. There is a walking trail that will take you along the ocean/cliffs which has some nice views. Also if you go about a block north of the hotel there is access with steps down to the ocean.

Lovely, uninterrupted view of the ocean and cliffs from both bedroom windows on south side. Overall, the room was clean with very nice linens, extra pillow, a good-sized closet to put your things in. Good-sized fridge and microwave. Bathroom shower had double shower heads, although no counter to put your cosmetics and toiletries. Overall, the hotel itself is modest, but very clean and comfortable. What you're paying for here is the view from the patios, just outside your door, no matter where you are in the hotel. We saw dolphins and seals swimming by almost every morning, and our last morning there, a lone seal pulled himself up to one of the rocks just fifty yeards or so from the lower patio. And, yes, the sunset is spectacular. There is ample seating on both the upper and lower patio for eating, or just ocean-gazing. Furthermore, the location is convenient to anywhere we went in San Diego, whether downtown, Mission Beach, Old Town, or La Jolla. Cabrillo National Monument is right next door to the south and should not be missed. We went tide-pooling there our first day in town. I guess my only quip would be that it's not convenient to a drugstore or grocery or restaurants (that are a short walk, anyway), as it's in a residential neighborhood. We had to drive around looking for restaurants and grocery stores. (There's a Trader Joe's in Point Loma on Rosencrans St.) Also, we were disappointed in both Ocean Beach restaurants we ate at - a little Italian storefront place (can't remember the name) and Nati's, which was actually mentioned in a guidebook.

We slept with the windows open to the sounds of the waves crashing below. The room was a decent size (I know they have much larger rooms but we selected this one based on the view and it was worth it) and was in good condition. The bathroom had a large shower with two shower heads and there was an ample supply of towels. - The view: I know I already mentioned it above, but it's worth mentioning again - the view cannot be beat. The hotel is right on the water (though there is no beach immediately adjacent) and the ocean views are wonderful. - The property: the two-level, U-shaped hotel surrounds a courtyard, which has a smallish pool and nicely landscaped gardens. There is also a two-level deck with lots of seating that overlooks the ocean. There are also outdoor fire places, which is a great feature. The deck area also includes a putting green. On the other hand: - Location: while it was wonderful to be right on the ocean, the hotel\u2019s location wasn't ideal for a couple reasons. San Diego has a number of great neighborhoods and in my opinion Ocean Beach wasn't one of them. There aren't more than 2 or 3 restaurants that are within walking distance and they were nothing special. You'll definitely need a car if you want to get to some of San Diego's great restaurants. The good news is that San Diego is quite an easy city to navigate. - Parking: while the hotel's website says \"Convenient free parking\" please note that this means street parking since there are only half a dozen parking spots at the hotel. Street parking is fine but it's worth knowing. - Large groups/small hotel: When we arrived there was a big group having a party in the common area. There were more people than could have possibly been staying in the hotel's 24 rooms. We asked reception what was going on and it turned out that a wedding group was staying at the hotel and they were having their rehearsal dinner. It was very disappointing as this large group took over the entire common area for the afternoon/evening and the behavior of some of the guests was not appropriate for a hotel where I'm paying $250 a night. At the very least, the hotel should have notified us of this large group when we made our booking. - Staff: I think the issue above really stems from the staff at the hotel. They were nonchalant about the above situation and in general less than friendly. It wasn\u2019t that they were rude; they just weren\u2019t very warm or welcoming. Overall though, I would recommend this hotel.", "Date": "October 17, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Flagstaff", "Title": "\u201cDiamond in the Rough\u201d", "Author": "brook892", "ReviewID": "UR5557223", "Content": "We just got back from this wonderful hotel. We had 4 kids and two adults and loved it. It is brand new and beautiful. We had a two bedroom suite with no kitchen. The shower had double heads, which made it easier to shower more than one child at a time. On the weekends they have a nice breakfast, homemade waffles, muffins, bagels, juices and coffee. There is a computer for your use with no charge. There is also a hotel cat that just adds to the whole ambience. Although you can't get into the ocean from there, it is still a lovely setting. Very quiet and quaint. The hotel staff is very accommodating and friendly. Driving to the hotel, I was questioning where we were going, but once there, it was definitely a fine.

The highlight was a courtyard with a swimming pool, and lots of chairs/tables for watching the sunset. There was also a lower \"deck\" with more chairs and tables. For us it was perfect for bringing back breakfast or dinner, and eating it on the deck while watching the sun set, or while our 2-year old son ran around happily. The hotel also has a nice \"lobby\", where there's a computer terminal, handy for searching local sites or pre-printing your boarding pass. They serve a simple continental breakfast (with waffles) on weekends only. Each room has a fridge. Right next door is a little shop that sells smoothies and simple meals (breakfast, gyros, falafels, hot dogs, etc), which is perfect if you're eating on the run, or want to keep things simple. Newport Avenue is a 7 block walk (15 minutes) thru a residential neighborhood. Another couple blocks along Newport and you'll hit restaurants, and finally Ocean Beach (probably a good 30+ minutes from the hotel). That distance is technically \"walking distance\", but it was too far to make it conveniently with my pregnant wife and toddler. The bad: Our room was much smaller than I expected. It was a tight squeeze for 3, although we got used to it during our 4 night stay. If it wasn't for the courtyard, the room size would have been intolerable. The hotel had bigger suites, but that was out of our budget. The inside of the room felt very much worn. Old, stained carpets and walls, lumbering closet doors, etc. It might have been clean, but it sure didn't look clean since it was so old and worn. We spilled a smoothie on their old carpets, and they charged us $40 for staining one of their towels in an effort to clean it up. Also, there's no parking. You just find a spot on the street as close as possible. That wasn't typically a problem for us, but it's something to know in advance. The ugly: The hotel. Maybe I came in with the wrong expectation. I sort of expected \"Holiday Inn Express\" appearance and quality, but instead saw a pretty tired little motel. As I mentioned before, the courtyard made the stay worthwhile for us. The room itself left a lot to be desired, but for the price I suppose it wasn't totally unreasonable.", "Date": "July 17, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "4", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Fort Worth, Texas", "Title": "\u201cWould definitely stay here again!\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR5421661", "Content": "Spent one week here on family vacation with two children (ages 4 and 6). The room was clean and quiet. Housekeeping was excellent. We had a one room suite with a fold out couch for the boys. The staff was friendly and seemed to really like kids. The other guests at the Inn were also friendly and nice. The Inn is located in a quiet and safe neighborhood. It was easy to get around to most points in San Diego (harbor, balboa park, point loma, seaworld, mission beach) without hitting the Interstate. The heated pool was a hit with the kids. One night we ordered chinese and a 20something San Diego native appeared at the door with the food. He politely asked if these were vacation homes or something. When I said yes, he replied that he had lived in San Diego all his life and didn't even know the Inn was there. He then looked at the ocean and remarked - it doesn't get any better than this.
