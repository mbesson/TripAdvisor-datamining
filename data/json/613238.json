{"Reviews": [{"Content": "convenient to train station but tiny space and not clean The hotel is about 5 minutes walk to the train station. The price was higher than other hotels nearby, so we thought we would get a good hotel room and booked this one. However, it turned out very disappointing. We went to the room after checked in, nd found the trash can was not cleaned. The room is so tiny, and the bathroom is impossible to sit comfortably. There are not enough basic amenities in the bathroom. At night, we found also that the bed linen smelled not fresh.", "Date": "Dec 11, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR981512791", "Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "1", "Check in / front desk": "2", "Overall": "2", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "3"}, "Author": "forhotel"}, {"Content": "Great Hotel       Room", "Date": "Nov 14, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR674171077", "Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Business service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "5", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "3"}, "Author": "abzsafado"}, {"Content": "Convenient, good value The hotel is near the train station and some of the neigbouring streets have sex clubs and eros centres, but its not 'in your face' and I was certainly never hassled during the hours I spent there! The hotel is very smart with a very stylish and welcoming lobby. The staff were very pleasant and helpful. My single room was a decent size with a comfortable bed, plenty of cupboard space and a well equipped bathroom - nice shower. The breakfast room was very pleasant with a good standard choice of juices, breads, cereals and cooked meats etc. It's a 10 minute stroll to the main museums and the Opera house and maybe 15 minutes to the centre. I liked Frankfurt, nice blend of old and new and the skyline, especially at night, is very impressive. I ate at Maingau which was pleasant but expensive and at Adolf Wagners in Sachsenhausen, pork knuckle and apple wine - very nice. The Opera is very good value 20 euros for a decent seat.", "Date": "Oct 24, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR773937723", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "3", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "Dallerton53"}, {"Content": "Great accomodation and good value I stayed at the Townhouse hotel in Frankfurt for one night this week for leisure. I booked it though a German booking site which gave the hotel good ratings, thus googling I found the tripadviser review and then booked it.Although the neighbourhood is not great it is not that bad, I expected it to be a lot noisier but it was not at all even though I stayed on the first floor at the front. Staff is very friendly hospitable and service minded. Interior design is nicely done, a lounge area and bar plus a seperate breakfast room in light and bright colors. Rooms are a bit small, but space is used very economical. Also bathroom is petite but all facilities are available and again great design. I had a queen size bed, which slept comfortable, tv, radio and mini bar (reasonably priced) small safe available. Closet space is good, seperate coat hanger (why do hotels not offer this as a standard?).Nice breakfast (buffet) lots of choice and freshly made. Room rate; I payed \u9227?70 incl tax  breakfast which is good money for good value. I definetly recommend this accommodation. However if you are staying there for more then 2 nights with 2 people you might want to choose for a bigger room.Hugo!Amsterdam October 27, 2006", "Date": "Oct 27, 2006", "ReviewID": "UR446244551", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "3"}, "Author": "dralion1"}, {"Content": "A simple Hotel that will almost certainly exceed your expectations I visited Frankfurt at the end of May for the Messe, first stay at the Townhouse, that I chose at the last minute, getting a very good deal on .laterooms.. The Hotel is clean, cheap, ideally situated, a few minutes walk from main train station and a few seconds from tram. Well .. the area around the station is not one of the safest with the large number of strip clubs and a few characters hanging around, but it\u9225\u6a9a usually like that in any major city, and I felt quite safe walking alone although I never came back too late at night. The hotel itself was very, very quiet - I loved the decor of the interior, with dark woods and spotlights. I must say I had no problems with the bed or with outside noise, although the view was looking onto the back of the building.The room was nice and clean, a little small (like in most of all new city hotels) but comfortable.Breakfast was included in the price of the room and it consisted of a buffet of cheeses, jams, breads, eggs, fruit, juices and coffee or tea.Staff was nice and helpful.Would stay there again!", "Date": "Aug 26, 2006", "ReviewID": "UR205926580", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "3"}, "Author": "Mirtillo"}], "HotelInfo": {"HotelURL": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g187337-d613238-r22637933-Townhouse_Hotel-Frankfurt_Hesse.html", "HotelID": "613238", "Price": "$74"}}
