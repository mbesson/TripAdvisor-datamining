Good food marts just around the corner and great to have the well-equipped kitchen. Separate living and bedroom was so welcome, and the bathroom is a good size. Heating was excellent. Wish they'd have servicing of the suite more often than weekly, but that being said, there was never a problem with asking for fresh towels or toiletries, at the door within five minutes.

The apartments offer great comfort and are very clean and spacious \u2013 much better than staying in a normal hotel room and exceeding other serviced apartments that I have seen in the City. You get all the hotel services like 24-hour front desk, gym, great business centre and lovely garden plus tope bathroom and kitchen amenities etc. Weekly cleaning is sufficient and towels and bed linen is changed at the same time. Great Molton Brown bathroom products. No disturbance from delivery trucks during the night either, which for NYC is a plus and overall noise levels for NYC very acceptable. Great location as you can walk everywhere within minutes, very safe neighborhood. The staff is outstanding. Barbara as the General Manager leads from the front and does an outstanding job, supported by an excellent team. I cannot recommend this place enough \u2013 its fantastic.

I booked a one week stay, 5 nights for business and 2 nights at the end for pleasure. The room & proeprty was exactly as nice as pictured on the web site. The one bedroom suite was the size of my condo at home, and is HUGE by typical New York City hotel standards. There was a king sized bed, full-sized stainless steel kitchen appliances, granite countertops in the kitchen, a living room, hardwood floors, a bathroom with marble walls and shower enclosure, a full bathtub, and tons of closet space. The room was only on the 6th floor, but the one-way street was relativey quiet for sleeping, compared to many NYC streets. My living room even had a balcony! The staff was excellent, very friendly, and extremely accomodating with tips on tourist attractions, nearby restaurants, nearby stores, etc. It rained one morning and the doorman gave me an umbrella to use for the day. Although it was a luxury accomodation, the staff was very helpful and understanding of my budget when I asked questions concerning items I was paying for personally. Maid service takes place only once (mid-week) during a week-long stay, but there were plenty of clean towels and other supplies, and the desk is willing to supply anything needed in between. My only criticism was that my clean sheets after the midweek change had some hair on them, likely either from the cleaning staff or whoever did the laundry.", "Date": "March 30, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Philadelphia, Pennsylvania", "Title": "\u201cGreat Hotel!

Traffic noise (honks from taxis and garbage trucks) was bad every night (even till 2AM in the morning!). Our friends stayed at one of the rooms facing away from the main road and said that noise was slightly better.

Booked AKA UN for 5 nights for a Spring trip - we were going to stay at the Marriott Residences to get the advantage of a kitchen - but for the same price as a studio there we booked a one bedroom apartment here - and appeared to be a much better buy. Position not immediately central - but only 5 min walk from Grand Central Terminus, or UN the other way. You could hear the traffic on 3rd ave - but only if you left the windows open. AKA is in a residential side street. Reception and doorman always friendly. The apartment was spotless with everything you wanted - well equipped kitchen, comfortable bedroom and lounge. Bathroom a little small - but good shower. Services every day - only minor criticism was that dishwasher powder not replaced daily. Light breakfast served in morning by reception and coffee available all day. There was a 24/7 corner shop - but a better bet was the supermarket just up 2nd avenue a few mins walk - this was also near the Manchester pub (a good English style pub - good beer and food ok), and next door to that a great Chinese restaurant and take away.
