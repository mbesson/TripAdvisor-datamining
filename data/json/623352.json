{"Reviews": [{"Content": "Really Seedy and Gross We stayed at this hotel for the weekend of the Saints/Eagles Playoff Game. Let me tell you not only is the hotel in a bad neighborhood where we were afraid for our lives but the building itself is in rotten shape. Our room was something out of the movie SAW...we were promised an executive double but were given a single and were told they had nothing else to give us. I took 1 shower the whole weekend because the shower was filled with mildew and the water pressure was like a dripping faucet. If you stay here, get so drunk in the quarer to where you forget how dirty the room is!", "Date": "Feb 21, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR150240144", "Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Business service": "1", "Cleanliness": "1", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "2", "Value": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "2"}, "Author": "ols1784"}, {"Content": "Good Deal I am a married 23 year old who needed a short but sweet getaway. This trip was nice. I stayed at the Lasalle December 7th -11th. I was satisfied with the room. It was definitely clean but was small. Thankful to this website I was aware of the doors that are much too outdated. After I checked in and taught myself how to trick the door, I was fine. The housekeeper and staff was exceptional in being extremely nice and helpful in suggestions and looking up information. Orlando(front desk) and TNoki(housekeeper) and Sean (front desk) were the employees who stood out to me fabulous. Because there is a free internet at the desk its quite convenient. Beware though that you must be back to the hotel before 11pm which can be inconvenient if you want to party til dawn! I was a bit disatisfied for the Lasalle not having a gym. I had to find an outside gym which is $12/day. Trust me having a gym is necessary because of the delicious Beignets. If you are looking to be quite close to the French Quarters beware that you have a 15 minute brisk walk before you.", "Date": "Jan 5, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR548940369", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "3", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "zoestrip"}, {"Content": "First timers.... Just returned home on 1-2-07. Can't say the hotel was a complete mess but I was a little disappointed. This hotel is very old and by the looks of it they are attempting to give it a bit of a face lift. However, the windows/walls are paper thin, bathrooms are not in good shap at all, and the sleeping area is just that...a place to lay your head at night. The staff was very nice, they even let us switch rooms so we wouldn't have to be up front where the road construction was going on. The location was ok. Kind of on the out skirts of the French Quarter but just a short walk to everything. The area it self was a little shaddy but that was to be expected. We were never scared or threaten. We enjoyed our stay and would return but not to that hotel. New Orleans is very much so up and running and we found no areas that are tourist friendly were effected by Katrina. I absolutly recommend the trip!", "Date": "Jan 3, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR507669043", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "2", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "3", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "3"}, "Author": "NattyBo"}, {"Content": "Lady Lasalle This hotel is not at all like reviews posted before the hurricane. I understand that it is under new ownership and management. I went to New Orleans on a business trip but also wanted to be in an affordable place close the the French Quarter. The LaSalle fit my needs perfectly. It is a vintage hotel with a European flavor, not fancy, but very clean and comfortable. The service was wonderful and the staff went out of their way to ask after us and make sure there was plenty of coffee at all times. I would be very happy to stay there again.", "Date": "Sep 13, 2006", "ReviewID": "UR950639682", "Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Business service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "3"}, "Author": "LadyLaSalle"}, {"Content": "Wonderfully Different: A Vintage Experience with 5 Star Service I just came back from a business/ working 2-day meeting at the Hotel LaSalle in New Orleans. This vintage hotel is truly located in the perfect place -easy walking distance to everything. Being a traveller that typically stays in 4 - star hotel chains- the Hotel Lasalle was a wonderfully different experience. Every room has it's uniqueness. Although the rooms were old, they were refreshingly clean and the hotel management and staff were unbelievable. They sincerely wanted to make your stay as comfortable as possible! I would rate the Service at Hotel LaSalle a 5- Star. This hotel is wonderfully safe and I would recommend it to anyone as one of the best values in New Orleans!", "Date": "Aug 31, 2006", "ReviewID": "UR506386816", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "3", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "Lady_Morningstar"}], "HotelInfo": {"HotelURL": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g60864-d623352-r6820994-Hotel_LaSalle-New_Orleans_Louisiana.html", "HotelID": "623352", "Price": "$99"}}
