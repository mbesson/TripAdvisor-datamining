They let us leave our bags for a day in the staff room while we visited Seattle. Rooms were clean, water extremely hot and we had a nice room next to a little garden. It was close enough to walk from the airport but we didn't know the way so we took a taxi for less than $10 including tip. As another reviewer mentioned, there is a very nice Denny's nearby (ask at reception for 20% discount coupon). Actually Denny's is about halfway to the airport so when we were leaving we walked about 10 minutes to Dennys for dinner, then about another 10 minutes to the airport. The hotel is midway between two train stops, around 15 minutes walk to Tukwila station from which you can take a very pleasant train ride into the city centre. If we were in Seattle again I'd probably look for another place even closer to the airport as there seems to be plenty of options and the airport is also a train line terminal, so easy to go to the city. But if you have a car, this hotel would be ideal.", "Date": "July 25, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "London, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cGood value for money, but too out of town.\u201d", "Author": "Kateofthedead", "ReviewID": "UR110579690", "Content": "My Sister & I travelled America for a month and really needed to save some cash on hotels for petrol & food, so out of the 18 places we visited we stayed at 13 Motel 6's. Firstly, the hotel is so easy to find - we did most of our trip using simple Google map directions and the location of this Motel 6 is ideal. The hotel is located 3 minutes from Seattle TAC Airport, we arrived at 8pm after a long 14 hour journey (one stop off) from London Heathrow, so we were tired and suffering with the 8 hour time difference. The hotel on arrival was average, a large car park and a motel looking exterior - whilst checking in I found the receptionist on the desk to be a little rude but being so exhausted and American/English service being different - I would only put this down to cultural difference rather than actual rudeness. The room itself is very basic but clean, do not expect any cooking facilities or a kettle. Motel 6 is very basic, coffee is served until 10:30am from reception but that is it. They're vending machines and the such in the motel service room with a can of coke being roughly $1. Our bathroom was a little dirty, a floor mat was hung over the bathroom door which appeared to be dripping a brown substance from it - which was still damp. Having stayed in so many Motel 6's in the last month whilst travelling America, almost all Motel 6's are the same and Seattle wasn't at all different from many of the places we stayed however the Motel itself could do with a little updating, yet if you're on a cheap budget and only plan to sleep in the room whilst visiting - I recommend this hotel. It's location to the airport is ideal but you must have a hire vehicle if you plan on visiting downtown or anywhere other than the small sparce strip the Motel is located on. Also, I'd advise you to not park anywhere near the hotel entrance or exits - our hire vehicle was hit from behind during a hit and run incident during the evening, although the reception area is manned 24 hours and most Motel 6's have security on site, our vehicle was parked by a very large floor to roof window in front of the reception area yet police were not informed until the morning hours when my Sister & I actually saw the damage and shunted vehicle. I gather reception staff will not take any responsibility for accidents or incidents and inform the police although reports of the accident were told to the staff from other hotel guests and the incident itself was apparently extremely loud. CCTV does not watch the carpark, only the office.", "Date": "May 30, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Longview, Washington", "Title": "\u201cAbsolutley Cleanest Rooms In Seattle\u201d", "Author": "B00GY101", "ReviewID": "UR95235025", "Content": "Originally I came to seattle on business and stayed at the La Hacienda because of location.Their rooms where 70 a night which was okay but all the rooms havent been remodeled and we stayed in one that smelled of cig smoke really bad.

At checkin, the clerk suggested a room in the back which she said was quieter. The view was kind of park-like, and there was a picnic table below (next to the garbage enclosed garbage cans). The room was within my expectations, very clean and adequate for the price. There was a bit of an 'old room' smell, but a couple of spritz's of my room spray took that away. We did turn the fan on for a bit of 'grey' noise overnight (again had to use my room spray). My bed was very comfortable, which was nice!

The AAA rating was unfair. I was apprehensive about staying here at a AAA-rated one-star hotel so I checked out the reviews at 'TripAdvisor.com'. I would say that the good reviews were right and the bad reviews were wrong. There is no bar nearby here as someone suggested. Since several reviews indicated noise problems, we asked for the quietest rooms. Both times they gave us rooms with numbers in the 140's. They were perfectly quiet. I didn't see evidence of partying types staying here, but you might have noise if you get the wrong neighbor. Those rooms were in a place where we had to walk about 20 yards to carry our luggage in, with no parking right in front. The rooms were clean and everything worked properly. Could have used a second chair. Excellent location for SeaTac. Check at the desk for directions to the airport so you make the correct turn; it is not marked on the highway. If you make the right turn, it is a 5 minute drive and then we spent about 10 minutes in plugged traffic at the airport, coming and going. They had no shuttle but we had a car. We had a 25 minute drive to a parking garage in downtown Seattle for sight-seeing. The staff was helpful with all our needs. No major complaints. This will be my first choice if I have to pick up someone in Seattle again. I just need a place where I can sleep and don't care about all the fancy stuff.

But I needed something cheap in that area and Motel 6 fit the bill. Also, I had stayed not long before at the Motel 6 at DFW airport and loved the value. I was not disappointed with the SEA airport Motel 6. Was it recently renovated? I don't know, but it was very clean. The staff at the desk were friendly and helpful. The room was very basic but perfect for my needs. I paid UIS$40. What value! It's now definitely my first choice in Seattle. The area is a bit sterile. Walk three short blocks south on the same side of the street to a very nice Denny's. There's no airport shuttle service, but just cross the street from the motel at the light and get the 174, which takes you to the terminal door. It's probably faster than waiting for a cab! GETTING THERE. I arrived in Seattle at the Greyhound Bus Depot downtown. Walk out the front door onto Stewart Street and look diagonally across the street to the left. You'll see the court house with a plaza in front. Head to the bus stop and take the 394 express. Take it all the way south to the airport and transfer to the 174 heading north, back to downtown Seattle. Yes, you're going in the direction from which you just came, but get this: The bus leaves you off right at the Motel 6 lobby! It's just a short ride from the airport; look for the huge Motel 6 sign in the air and ring the buzzer. If you have luggage, it couldn't be easier--all for $1.75. Then getting back to downtown Seattle is easy with the 174 bus stop at your door, The ride is just 40 minutes, again for $1.75.

My only complaint would be that they didn't provide shampoo, only soap. No biggie.
