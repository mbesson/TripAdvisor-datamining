Service was POOR!! looks like they hired all the underage staff at this hotel. not well spoken. not something you expect to be at a high end hotel (not sure if it is high end, just assumed by the price). Then they called us on the last day, reminding us the check out is at 12pm. You can not take the taxi to the hotel, you have to carry your own luggage down the street to get to this hotel.

Also, the water pressure in the shower was a bit weak and the cosmetics they provide were a bit limited, and they didn't have slippers.

Having seen the hotel many times and loving the location, we finally decided to spend the expensive price and give the hotel a try. First let me say, the hotel looks great in the pictures and even looks good when you see the rooms, but facilities are very un-fuctionable (I hope that's a word). Our problems were the floors were made with wood strips that were screwed in, but the screws are backing out, thus you can really tear up you feet on the screws. Next, the toilets are square, literally. The square, thin rimmed toilet seat make you feel like you are sitting on a bucket. Next, the bathroom and shower are smaller than if you were on a cruise ship. It may sound minor, but you do not even have room to store your toothbrush. On the positive side, you are right on the beach. Unfortunately, they have planted palm trees and obstructed the views from most of the rooms. The front desk staff was very friendly and accommodating. The bellmen were always available and even made the extra effort to anticipate needs. The restaurant staff however, missed the hospitality class that the front desk staff must have received.

They were prompt in taking our orders for beverages and when asked would recommend items on the menu for lunch or a snack. The food is outstanding, and the portions generous, and perhaps the best ceviche I've ever had. The staff was always helpful by suggesting restaurants for our dinners. Our first night we dined at the sister property the Mosquito Blue and had a fabulous dinner. As expected, the room is small and dark with limited storage space.

We had reserved our stay at their other hotel Mosquito Blue but when we arrived they said they were having issues with their AC so they Upgraded us to Mosquito Beach. Gentleman helped us carry our luggage over to the hotel and then after checking in helped us to our room. It is a pretty sexy room, small but big enough for a king or queen size bed. I love dark colors so the room looked very nice but the problem was there wasn't enough lighting in the room and no full size mirror aside from the mirror in the bathroom. We stayed in room 214 and had a balcony facing the street. It was pretty quiet at night, the bar or club across the street was closed and looks like its being renovated or just being replaced with something else. So no noisey drunk people in the middle of the night. The room was thoroughly cleaned every day up to 2x a day. The front desk was always nice and the location of course was awesome. The bed was sort of hard and had fluffy pillows which I loved but I guess some people think they are too fluffy. We did live out of our suitcase for the 4 days we were there, no drawers and barely any hangers for anything. Most of our trip was outside of the hotel, we only came to sleep. One night we were at the bar and was surprised that for 4 drinks we paid nearly 50 dollars for total. It was empty on a sunday night and I thought \"maybe this is why!! 50US dollars?!? We didnt go back and decided to just stay drinking on the 5ta ave restaurants and bars. We never got to eat anything since every morning we would run out to do our activities so no opinions on breakfast. Never had breakfast or took advantage of the 10% discount for lunch or dinner that entire time. We never used the beach beds since we preferred getting in the water and only stayed out on the beach for about 2hrs since we get tanned and burned easily. Would I go back to the hotel? Maybe, but I would like to try some other hotels that I saw. But I would recommend the hotel if you just wanna lounge on the beach and be close to everything. The ADO bus terminal is close, beach is down the block and opposite way is 5ta ave which is where all the action is.

However, those fears were put to rest almost immediately after arriving. The common complaints from other reviews are not entirely unfounded. The rooms are small. They are also dark, lack storage space and have impractical toilets. But the hotel more than made up for those minor faults with its fantastic location and chic atmosphere. The grounds are immaculately kept and the rooms are cleaned to the highest standards daily. The front desk service was absolutely top flight and always performed with a smile. My wife and I, anticipating the difficulty of carrying on phone conversations in Spanish, asked the concierge to help us with some booking details and they were always happy to do so. The location of MB stands out as perhaps its greatest asset. Our room was literally ten steps from the front door to the sand of the beach but it always had a welcome sense of privacy whenever we wanted to get away. Furthermore, the hotel is just half a block from the main walking mall of PDC. The beach service that the hotel provided was friendly and usually timely. Also, the hotel provides beach mattresses to lie on which are comfortable and perfect for snuggling with your partner as you sip a drink. If you don't speak Spanish, don't worry, pretty much every staff member of MB speaks excellent English. Is MB spendy? Yes. Does it have some flaws? Yes. But by and large the reviews I have read of this hotel are off base in my opinion. The shortcomings of the hotel are not vacation-killers (hell, they barely registered on the radar and I probably wouldn't have thought twice about them had I not read about them in the reviews). The strengths of the hotel are some of the reasons why our recent vacation to PDC was so great. One of the best pieces of advice my wife and I read regarding vacationing is \"know yourself.\" Meaning, know what you want. Are you looking for a trendy atmosphere with a killer location? Mosquito Beach is the place for you. Are you looking for quiet, empty beaches and a large hotel room? Look elsewhere.

This hotel ruined our vacation, and this has never happened to us anywhere else. We were sold on a luxury boutique hotel and the pictures on the website certaintly indicated this. When we arrived, we knew we had been duped. The place is severly run down. IT smells like humidity. The wood floor is filled with rusted nails. The wood on our balcony was peeling. The hallway to our room smelled like humidity, worst than a lockeroom! We stayed in a junior suite and the shower was smaller than what I have had in cruises. The place was simply unacceptable! When we wen to the beach, they had no fresh towels. The excuse was they were sooo busy, no time to wash them! The bathroom in the restaurant did not have a look and smelled worst than a locker room! I could not believe the state of the place. We immediately called reservations and let them know that we were not satisfied with the place and we wanted to move hotels. They said this was fine, but that they would have to charge us for the entire 7 night stay. More than 3 thousand dollars!!! We could not believe it. WE argued and argued but it was useless. We decided the place was so bad we were better off moving hotels. However, we were only able to find a hotel that was 20 minuted from Playa del Carmen. Thus, since we were getting charged anyways, we specifically told the people at the MOsquito Beach that we expected our room to be available for the seven days. After all, we were getting charged. We would need a place to change and leave our things when we came into playa. We purposely did not check out,. After a couple of days when we came back to playa, our key did not work. The receptionist gave us a new key a and what a surprise to find our room full of another persons things. Naturally, they had rented out our room to another person! We immediately called reservations and they promised to reimburse us for 100% of our money by Monday.We had to change in the employees bathroom, and I cannot overstate the bad state that was in. Overall a terrible experience. O Monday, when we called they told us that we had misunderstood and that they would only refund 2 nights. What happen is they purposely lied to us so we would not create a scene and ask for our room back!! We talked to everyone at the hotel including the manager, who told us that we were lucky to get a 2 night refund! We are still waiting for this refund and I am already losing hope that this will happen. There low level of professionalism and just outright lying to clients. All of it is very disturbing and upsetting.

But Mosquito Beach Hotel .. that's a different story. Before i start my lenghty review, let me tell you who I travelled with, so you can have a better perspective of what we were expecting from this hotel. I went there with my bf , my brother and 3 of his closest friends. We are all in our early 30's, we are all pretty active, loved great food and wine, we are into travelling to luxurious and exotic locations, as well as budget destinations, we love to rest but also to party and hang out with other peeople, and we have travelled pretty much all over the world. All of this makes me think that the people who loved Mosquito Beach is because they do not know what service level means, or are bedazzled by the description of the hotel in their website or just thought they stayed in a so called chic exclusive place ... but let me tell you, MB is none of the above. Where to start? * Rooms: My boyfriend and I booked a White Sand (partial ocean view, Bvlgary ammenities, plasma TV, kind size bed, beautiful italian furniture, spacious room, balcony, etc .. the list is long) what we got NO PARTIAL OCEAN VIEW, but a garden view (beware, ALL WHITE SAND ROOMS are located in the same building and NONE has ocean view, not even some of the 700 USD master suites have ocean view !!!!!) When we complaint, they said, this is \"partial ocean view, you can walk to the beach from here and see it through the gardens\". We got an obscure, and not chic atmosphere, pretty disfunctional room, no bed side tables, no cabinets to store your clothes, not enough hangers, not enough light, (not even for make up or male's shaving processes) the whole room smelled like urine because of the humiddity (they didn't built it properly) and the \"beautiful wooden floors\" were so cheap that they cracked open in both, our terrace and inside the room just by walking on it !!!! The \"art pieces\" weren't art at all (they paint it themselves and hang it on the walls!!!), the italian furniture ... we found the place where they built them near Playa del Carmen!!! As for the ammenities, they provided us with shampoo, gel de douche and one soap (for both the sink and shower), so when you ask for more soap, it's a big deal (since they are Bvlgari, and they dont want to \"waste\" them ..) and they WONT gave us conditioner nor lotion, nor any of the other ammenities and if u forgot your tootbrush or something else, good luck on the store pal!! And this is a 368 - 460 USD room !!! My brother and his friends all booked Sunrise rooms (the descriptions were almost the same, except that there were double beds instead of king size) what they got was a tinny room with two single beds (where in the world, when you book a double room you get individual beds rather than double beds? nowhere but Mosquito Beach!!! and for 312-390 USD) and a tinny TV plasma and the same problems we found in our room.... Later on, my brother decided to check out an upgrade to a Brezze room (aprox 40 USD more) just to find out that it was EXACTLY HIS SAME room, but with a king size bed .... * Food - absolutely awful and way overpriced. The waiters are rude too and expect a lot of tip. The minibar is pretty overpriced as well. The restaurant and room service only runs from 7:30 am to 4:30 pm, so beware of this .. * Beach club - who has black day beds on the beach ???? because it's chic??? what about comfort? what about the fact you're frying your skin on those? shouldn't those be white or so??? the beach club IS PACKED !!!! not enough day beds for all customers AND they rent those for customers outside of the hotel. One of the main purposes we decided to stay at MB was because of such exclusive luxurious beach club .. well you can stay somewhere else and still have access to it !!! (MB is one of the ONLY hotels in Playa that allows non-customers to enjoy its beach club) Actually there are plenty of hotels that have beach clubs next to MB, and are less crowded. The beach itself wasn't what we expected, since it was destroyed a few years back after Hurricane Wilma and it's not a white sand beach anymore, but you can still find some spots that aren't as bad as MB's beach is. * Pool area: absolutely small, and packed. * Construction: they were providing maintenance INSIDE the hotel the ENTIRE time of our vacation .. fixing doors, painting ceilings and walls, welding a roof, etc .... even in our terrace!!! (one morning we woke up by this terrible noise just to find a guy in our private terrace welding something), when we complaint, management said: no worries, they will only work on it today and tomorrow !!!! [-]!!!! * Concierge service: completely unexistant. * Parking for rental cars: unexistant as well. * Gym/Sport facilities: unexistant. * Airport transfers: Beware. When i booked it, they were very anal about getting every detail for both flights, and since i wasn't sure about the departure information, or whether we were going to need it, they advice me to book the round service with the premise that i could cancel later the return transfer or modify the information, and when i tried to do so with 3 days in advance they gave me a simply NO, you have to pay for it entirely, and no changes are allowed. * Management obviously doesn't know what they are doing, and they are only ripping people off and taking advantage of their location. But the worse is that whenever they screw up, they don't even apologize !!!! We were bothered in two occasions about huge bills (1,000 US and 600 USD) that we didn't know what they were coming from !!!! and had to spend some time clarifying such. Inconvenient hassle you don't need when on vacation .. * Beware of the exchange rate !!!! Most places have it between 13 and 13.5 pesos for a dollar. This place is 14, but the tricky part is that they charge your bill in dollars, and in order to avoid this you have to pay in US dollars cash, otherwise, they will convert your bill in dollars to pesos at THEIR exchange rate, and then charge it to your credit card. My advice is to stay in one of the following places: (much better, and not such a major rip off, with access to the same beach) * Corto Maltes condos * The Royal Playa del Carmen * Hotel Real Playa * Pueblito Escondido Hotel OR if you wanna splurge and keep the same level of service that you expect from a 500 USD room hotel then stay at: * Mayakoba Fairmont * Grand Velas Riviera Maya * Secrets (for honey mooners) Good luck!", "Date": "January 12, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "2", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Service": "1", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "valann38", "Title": "\u201cNot a good place\u201d", "Author": "valann38", "ReviewID": "UR22595847", "Content": "Staff on the beach were unfriendly.

We loved Playa del Carmen but HATED Mosquito Beach. First of all, it is WAY OVERPRICED! Do your homework (which we did not) and you will find that this place charges FAR MORE than any other property in the area - including beach front luxury places. We decided to splurge on ourselves so we went for the suite with an ocean view...which is more than we wanted to spend, but we figured it must be pretty luxurious for that price and were willing to upgrade to have the beautiful view that they advertise for that room. Well, it turns out that when we got there they said that we were in the OTHER suite - the one with a view of the pool and the street, but for the same price. We were very unhappy and told them that we specifically had requested the room that is advertised as having the ocean view - they first denied that we specifically requested the one with the view, but later (when we showed them the confirmation email noting the ocean view suite) acknowledged it but said there was nothing they could do about it now because it was booked. Well, the other suite was not even a suite - just one large room with a slight alcove (the size of a chair) that overlooks the pool. Its just a bigger room but a lot of wasted space. And it smelled like mildew (or urine). The furniture was uncomfortable and the whole room was very dark and dreary (dark brown walls, dark wood floors, poor lighting, dark curtains). Funky, but not what we were hoping for with a beach vacation. Not to mention that there really were no amenities - there is a nice beach club but even there the service was poor, and the place did not have much in terms of concierge service that you would expect from a plce where you are paying $500 a night! Well, the worse part of it all was that when we told them that we were unhappy about their mix up with the room and made it clear that the ONLY reason we booked the suite was for the ocean view, not because we needed a suite - and despite the fact that they acknowledged they messed up - they did NOTHING to compensate us or apologize, etc. By the way, we found a really nice place two blocks over that has two bedroom apartments with kitchens and an ocan view and rooftop deck (private) that rents for $270 a night! (I think it is called Corto Maltes) - had we seen it early enough we would have switched places but we did not see it until our last night there!

I liked the open-aired reception area/front desk. But, The modern / minimalist architecture and interior design ran amok and stood in stark contrast to the surrounding culture, look, and feel and eclipsed functionality. This could possibly be crafted into a unique and beneficial attribute. However, an extreme lack of light and very small size of the guest rooms and baths left all of us wishing for something better. The room keys were black and if you set them down you might have to request another as they are quite difficult to find in the dark. Few lamps and fewer electrical outlets, and NO furniture with a drawer or bedside tables leave you with few options but to leave your clothes and personal items strewn about the floor. The square-shaped toilet is really fun to look at but you don't want to use it. The very small shower with overhead vs wand sources of water are difficult at best to operate especially with wet hands. Don't get me wrong, Play Del Carmen is spectacular, but the archictural theme of this property has taken precedence to comforts and conveniences expected in an average hotel. I have visited this area before and had an amazing hotel experience. Construction is underway at the property as of March 2008 and looks as if it will continue for at least another 6-9 months. Jackhammers begin early as of this writing. Final comment, it seems all rooms do not take advantage of the ocean front location of the property with the room/balcony views facing inward into the courtyard. Bottom line, just a nice place to sleep (although pricey for this type of niche), while enjoying Playa Del Carmen.

Well our experience was totally different. First day we arrived our room was late. We had to wait like 2 hours before our rooms was ready. A nice surprise were the construction works next doors. Noise started around 7:30am till 6pm. We tried to talk to the manager. At first front desk personnel told us that it was normal to have that noise and that we should not harass the manager with that. After some time the manager was on holidays and would not be back before the end of our trip. So they actually told us if we wanted we could use a room in the mosquito blue or just cope with it. Rooms: well small, no space for luggage but some nice design. A little moist due to high humidity but normal I think. Positive but a bathtub would be nice. Hotel: they had a nice architect. Beware of the breakfast that should be all inclusive. Totally not. You have a daily 10$ credit for your breakfast per person. So you will pay your orange juice every morning. Any other demand will be charged and you\u2019ll get a response from the personnel \u2018what the heck are you asking me again\u2019. Also breakfast choices are limited to eggs, eggs, eggs, fruit, toast with jam and 2 cups coffee. No more. Please take your time when you\u2019ll have your breakfast and don\u2019t be surprised to order fried eggs with bacon and receive an omelet with mushrooms and ham. Best thing for the Mosquito beach is its location a nice view from the breeze rooms. Right on the beach and in the center of 5th av. The evening shift of the bar/restaurant is the opposite of the morning shift. Food is really good and the barmen are funny. We spent 10 nights over there with 3 couples. They all complained about the noise and the morning moods of the personnel. Rude responses are a common activity over there. Recommendation: Don\u2019t go there to have a nice calm holiday works will continue for some time. You will have a nice drilling sound as wakeup call, you will be asking morning personnel 5 times after your eggs or ketchup or toast, and front personnel that are left alone with no manager. If you go to Mosquito beach well do it for the location and architecture, but there are some other nice hotels next doors and cheaper. it\u2019s my first time in all my travelling time I write a review, but this one was really worth it.

The Staff\u2026 The staff went above and beyond our expectations. The waiters remembered our coffee, breakfast, and drink preferences and their greetings brought smiles to our faces each day. Before we finished breakfast, our lounge chairs were reserved and awaiting our arrival on the beach. The staff also provided excellent suggestions for places to eat and knew which dance clubs to go to on any given night. The Rooms\u2026 Okay, so the rooms aren\u2019t 800 square foot palaces, but there is more than plenty of room to move around comfortably. The showers are phenomenal, as are the designer skin/hair products they provide for you. The bed and pillows were very comfortable. The three gripes we had were: no dressers, a very small bathroom sink vanity, and only one small mirror in the room. That said - we managed quite nicely and those \u201cgripes\u201d had very little impact on our wonderful stay. The Food\u2026 We had coffee and ate breakfast on the beach every morning. The breakfast choices (eggs, sausage, fruit, yogurt, etc.) were quite delicious. We ate lunch at the hotel twice and the food was good. If it weren\u2019t for the enormous selection of restaurants within walking distance, we would have eaten more meals at the hotel. The Beach\u2026 The hotel has a private beach and provides lawn and lounge chairs for the guests. The lounge chairs have individual sunshades, handy for sleeping or reading books. The beach was clean (no trash or seaweed), the water was clear, you could wade out a long way, and there was no coral or seaweed in sight. The hotel is close enough to walk to the pier, yet far enough away to not hear the boats or smell their exhaust and fumes. The Weather\u2026 Well\u2026we were there in late January\u2026 Several of the days the sun came out and we were able to bask in its warmth\u2026but the nights were another story.

HOWEVER, the rooms are lacking for the price. They are nice, but small, (there are no room photos on the website because you cannot get an adequate angle to take a pic) and the views are nothing to write home about (there really is no beach view due to the angles/placement of the rooms). Also, they all have real hardwood floors which means you have a 50/50 chance of getting noisey neighbors upstairs that you will hear their walking/coming in late at night. While on the subject of noise, there is a condo complex being buily next door - I'm not a contractor, but realistically, there is at least 3 to 6 months of work left in my opinion. The noise/workers inhibit use of the pool area (unless you like construction workers checking out your girl/wife in her bikini) We spent our days on the beach which was great, but we actually DOWNGRADED our room because the original room was back to back connected to construction project/noise/jack hammering, etc,etc. If you like to sleep in, do not stay here for the next few months. We were up early every day so this was not a problem.

When we got there everything seemed nice, but once we got our rooms the power went off, it was the middle of the night, so we could not see anything, it only lasted a few minutes. On our second night, the power went off from 6.00 AM until 12.30 PM, we had no air conditioning and no water in our rooms, to use the bathroom service personnel had to bring water from the pool, we could not shower or brush our teeth. But that wasn't it..., they started repairing the power service at 6.30 AM, which woke us up because of the noise. We were told we were going to be compensated for this problem, which of course did not happen when we were leaving. And that wasn't it, some of our friends were arriving two days later, they had a reservation and the day before their arrival I asked the woman at the front desk if everything was ok, which she confirmed. Once our friends got there, they told them that they couldn't stay there and had them moved to the Mosquito Blue. I guess my friends were lucky, we saw a few more people arrive and presented with the same situation, and since the Mosquito Blue was also full they had to leave with no where to stay, since the hotel staff could not provide them with service at another hotel. The service at the hotel is very poor, we asked to speak to the manager several times, we even saw him at the beach (he is there all the time) but he never even care to come and speak to us. Also the service staff at the beach is no good, and that gets worse if you are from Mexico (like us)... you'll get better service if you are from another country.

Overall we had a good experience. The rooms are extremely small, with not much space for your stuff, but that isn't a big deal. They are very nicely appointed rooms, with awesome showers and very efficient A/C. The bed was very hard, which bothered my husband, but not me. The rooms are very dark, as other people have mentioned, but we enjoyed the cool and dark respite from the bright heat outside. The location was great. It's right on the main street in town, but you can also walk right out front to the beach. The restaurant is open-air and right on the beach, and has good food and service. There is a very nice pool and also a great set up at the beach with huge beds and umbrellas. We never had any trouble getting a spot. Having food and drinks delivered pool or beach-side was also nice. Also, the housekeeping was excellent and the rooms were very clean. The downside: the very noisy construction next door. Monday thru Saturday very loud construction occurred directly next to the pool. It wasn't too bothersome in our room, and the loud music in the beach area drowned it out, but it rendered the pool area mostly unusable. Even our ipods couldn't help us block out the noise. One other note, the front desk consists of one person sitting by the pool at a desk with a laptop. I would describe the overall service level of the front desk as \"minimalistic\". But again, the bell hop, housekeepers and restaurant were very good. If you enjoy modern design and a great location you will like this hotel, as long as you don't need a lot of space and are prepared for a fairly intrusive level of noise from the construction.

My husband and I stayed in Mosquito Beach hotel during the Memorial weekend, and the location was great. The rooms are small, but are ultra modern, complete with flat screen TV, A/C, and an amazing shower. The d\u00e9cor is simple and elegant. Our room was closest to the beach, right next to the hotel\u2019s restaurant, which has amazing food (particularly great breakfast), and they can serve you on the beach, while you catch your tan. Being in the heart of the city, the hotel is an easy access to both water attractions and nightlife, from stores to restaurants it is all a few steps away! To that extent, it was enjoyable and a right location for our vacation needs. Playa del Carmen is in constant growth, so there is a hotel being built next door, but aside from morning work, it is really not an issue. However, there are two pieces of advice we left with them: service is poor, and there is no internet access (one has to go to the sister Mosquito hotel to gain free access to a computer and internet). What do we mean by poor service? My husband wanted to use an iron to iron his shirt before dinner, but the hotel has only one board and one iron, which you have to borrow from the main office. The trouble was, it took them three hours to deliver it and then they wanted it back within ten minutes, actually coming at our door to take it while he was still ironing his shirt. Second example \u2013 we ran out of shampoo and asked for an additional bottle. After repeatedly asking the service staff and the lobby for a bottle, we ended up getting one two days later!

Thunderstorms had rumbled across Texas, delaying our Austin/Dallas, Dallas/Playa flights by a few hours. Luckily (so we thought) we had booked Expedia\u2019s recommended transportation from the airport to the Mosquito Beach Hotel. Pretty well all the flights into Playa were delayed, so the transportation wasn\u2019t phased at all. We were loaded up into the van with a number of other couples. Little did we realize that we were going to stop at every other hotel on the Maya Riviera on the way to the Mosquito Beach Hotel (which turned out to be the penultimate stop). Imagine our surprise when the driver thumped the van up onto the sidewalk in Playa, dumped us out and told us that we had to drag our luggage two and a half blocks to get to the hotel. Exhausted by the day, it was the last thing we needed. Be warned \u2013 the hotel is in an pedestrian area that taxis and vans cannot enter after 6 at night. After cussing out the gods of travel, we finally got to the reception desk to check in. Disappointed again. The manager explained that because of the construction taking place next door (the remodeling of the previously excellent El Faro hotel) our room (Beach front suite) had been \u2018damaged\u2019. Take note \u2013 as of June 07, construction is taking place ALL DAY, EVERY DAY ten feet from this hotel. Anyway, the manager told us that we have been moved to an \u2018upgraded\u2019 room in the Mosquito Blue hotel (the sister hotel) for just one night and would we care to walk there now. Yes - Walk there now, keeping a few paces behind the man who took our luggage. Well, my idea of an upgrade (from a beach front suite) and his idea are clearly 2 different things. The Mosquito Blue is about 4 blocks back from the beach in a dark and humid part of town. The \u2018upgraded\u2019 room was small, dark and smelled of mould (something else to note, if you have allergies). Come the morning we returned to the Beach hotel, had breakfast, viewed the construction site and asked when we could check in. Again, it wasn\u2019t going to happen. We were in the \u2018Blue\u2019 for what appeared to be the duration. We called Expedia, only to be told that the management of the Beach hotel had told Expedia that we had called ahead and cancelled our booking! It was clear that the hotel was overbooked. A lot of wrangling and about $75 of international calls to Expedia and we were on our way to Cancun to take advantage of a great \u2018on the day\u2019 rate we locked in at a luxury hotel there.

Amenities in general were nice though. Proximity to the beach, and use of the beds/chairs was great. Staff was all very friendly and not pushy at all. There WAS construction going on during my stay which didn't really bug me too much, but I opted to move anyway. The balcony got smoky when construction was going on, and the noise got annoying (although it never woke me, it was kind of off-putting to be in paradise with heavy machinery working over your head). Spoke to the front desk and they quickly and gracefully accomodated a move to Mosquito Blue, down the block and much quieter, roomier, and more 'functional'. You also still have access to the Mosquito Beach chairs/beds. Overall-- i wouldn't stay here again but it wasn't a bad experience. If you want to stay on the beach, Playa Maya 2 buildings over on the beach looks like a good bet. Otherwise, Mosquito Blue is a good choice if you want to stay in town.

If you don't like to be cold put the air on like 25, but don't cut it off. *Yes if you are the type of girl that wears makeup on a beach vacation, you will need to bring a mirror to put makeup on out on the patio (it's not a big deal at all). *They are doing construction next door but it was not a big deal at all. No problems with odor. No problems with water pressure (it was great). No problems with service or staff.... No problems with the room key... No problems...but we did have to listen to a lady moan one night (I think they were in the room next to us but it sounded like the whole city and maybe some people in China could've heard it ?! just so you know...but I think they must have had their patio door open??!) Hotels that share the same sort of ambience: Ian Schrager Hotels (like Mondrian Hollywood & Hudson NY) Hotel ZaZa in Dallas (young/trendy/swanky) FOOD: 1) La Parilla is on the corner & it's delicious. 2) If you want cheap & yummy tacos try Dr Taco on 10th (just walk straight up from the hotel to 10th and take a right-you'll see it) They have dollar tacos. little but yummy! 3) AJUA is an absolute must!!!! I only wish we would've known about it sooner than our last night!!! 4) 100% Natrual Restaurant is great too, great breakfast. Fresh juices all healthy stuff that's tasty!! 5) Cheap Tacos-try the 24hour taco stand that looks like a VW Bus...I know-sounds weird but it was so very delicious I ate there several times & it's like 90 pesos a taco, get like 3 chicken tacos & a coke...you'll be pleased.
