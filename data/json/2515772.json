That is what good customer service looks like Extended Stay management. Next, I called the front desk to schedule a wake up call. It took me 3 attempts calling 10 minutes apart letting the phone ring for about 2 minutes each call before someone picked up the phone. Also, my room had leaking shower that dripped all night and long strands of hair were found in my \"clean\" sheets.", "Date": "April 22, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Union MO", "Title": "\u201cGreat Hotel!!!!\u201d", "Author": "Cathy W", "ReviewID": "UR128284267", "Content": "I spent 6+ months at this hotel.

As an extended stay in there is no daily house keeping service. only once per week. At check in we were told to come to the front desk for extra towels etc. however the front desk on day two said they were out of clean towels until the following day, they had no toilet paper, and no regular coffee for the in room coffee pots just decaf. We were given an extra box of tissue paper to suffice as toilet paper. The hotel was quiet, room had a flat screen tv the free continental breakfast consists of coffee, those odd tasting muffins wrapped in plastic, apples, oatmeal, bananas somedays cereal bars, Mixed feelings clean, good location, very cheap light blankets that do not keep you warm,not a very comfortable bed, no room service, running out of toilet paper etc yet quiet and pet friendly.. you need to make up your mind on this one.. Would not stay here if we were traveling without our dog.", "Date": "April 21, 2012"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Extended StayAmerica Hotel Circle", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g60750-d224242-Reviews-Extended_StayAmerica_Hotel_Circle-San_Diego_California.html", "Price": "$66 - $121*", "Address": "<address> <span rel=\"v:address\"> <span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">2087 Hotel Circle South</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:locality\">San Diego</span>, <span property=\"v:region\">CA</span> <span property=\"v:postal-code\">92108</span></span> </span> </span> </address>", "HotelID": "2515772", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/ProviderThumbnails/dirs/ae/8d/ae8dfa4fd8841540bc90ab855528dd4d6large.jpg"}}
