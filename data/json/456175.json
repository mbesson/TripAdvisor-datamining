Unfortunately the rest is a let down:- Cheap furnitures,- Cheap linen,- Some cockroaches in the kitchen with a strong musty smell,- Under standard appliances (small TV, noisy ref).- Very common breakfast (cheap cereals, scrambled eggs, bread, tea  coffee, that's all).- Small swimming pool, etc.The worst is that despite the hefty price they try to rip you more with lot of add-on:- Internet is not free (100S$/month and only 512Kbs bandwidth),- Cable TV doesn't include some basic channels (eg nothing for the kids),- Utilities is included only up to 250S$/month. And with 33\u63b3C electricity for aircon will easily get you above it.So all together, I've been very disappointed and will avoid Somerset in the future!", "Date": "Apr 23, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR886598532", "Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Business service": "1", "Cleanliness": "1", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "1", "Value": "1", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "3"}, "Author": "TravelerInAsia"}], "HotelInfo": {"HotelURL": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g294265-d456175-r14821011-Somerset_Compass-Singapore.html", "HotelID": "456175", "Price": "$455"}}
