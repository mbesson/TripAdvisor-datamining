Hotel is very nicely decorated and furnished, and rooms have great air con, tv (no english channels), and a wall radio (which was great), also have a small drinks fridge which is really handy. We also got a nice suprise to be given breakfast over the road in a neighbouring cafe, it is continental self service breakfast, good qulaity and very tasty, great for the days tourist activities. Check in was a little complex as the woman at the desk spoke virtually no English but we got by. Dont hesitate to book here if your looking for a good base for a tourist holiday. P.S RE the location, 10/15 mins in a taxi from airport 4 stops in the underground from Madrid's main train station, and two minute walk from underground. Tons of bars/eateries all near by (excellent spannish resteraunt (1st on left when walk out hotel).

The (included) breakfast in the near cafe is good: it is not a real continental breakfast, but more a Spanish one with bread and fresh tomato / olive oil, a lot of fruits, yoghourt and croissants. The reception is not always open, but you can always ask or phone to the sister hotel (1 min walking). We needed a taxi at 4am, they have (of course) booked it for us, and the reception stayed open for us that night. One more, the hotel, the room and the street especially look much better in reality than in the photos on booking. If I have to say something negative, the internet connection was only by lan.

Nothing could have been further from the truth. The room was clean, the bed comfortable, and the bathroom spotless with plenty of hot water. The fourth floor rooms get almost no street noise. The most amazing point, however, was the air-conditioning. We visited during the hot Spanish summer, and yet the AC was perfectly capable of making polar bears comfortable. There were a few minor downsides. We had some initial difficulties at check-in, as El Pasaje's computers were down, and check-in was being handled by a hotel down the street. Reception is frequently unmanned, although an attendant can usually be reached via interom. The elevator is quite small, which meant that we needed to take two trips when moving luggage. At this price point, however, I was a bit surprised to find an elevator at all!

She did not understand it we discussed maybe 10 minutes, later she called someone and the man in the phone was helpful. Tomorrow, they gave us double room. But when we wanted to go out in the evening. These girl and two friends were talking in the lobby. They saw us suddenly stopped and did not say even 'hola' = 'hello' although we said.

Whilst the rooms are small, they are clean and very well furnished with fridge, flat screen tv, aircon, safe and shower room. Breakfast is served in the Cafe Levante (Hotel Victoria) at the end of the street which posed no problem at all. Our room was at the back and had no view, but as there is a bar below and one opposite the hotel, it suited us perfectly. However, saying that, even though the bar has several tables outside, it seemed to attract mainly hotel users (us included!) and there was never any rowdiness whilst we were there, (in fact we saw no rowdiness at all in Madrid, despite the crowds) so I would not let this put anyone off booking the El Pasaje as it is in an ideal spot for all that Madrid has to offer.
