We were then ushered to the 'sala guigi' on the next floor up and given a welcome Prosecco (always welcome!) and some snacks. Our room was on the top floor and there are no lifts but we were helped with our baggage and then shown the room and it's workings. Our room was suite 336. It was decorated in muted neutral tones with dark wood furniture and the linens and fixtures were of excellent quality. The bath was at the foot of the bed which may seem odd to some people - but try it - it was the deepest, most comfortable bath I've ever been in. With bubbles from the high-end toiletries and a glass of wine you will soon relax! The hotel is small - boutique - and is beautifully decorated. There are furnishings / influences from all around the world; all very evident in the small lounge and terrace. It doesn't have a huge variety of facilities/services but what they do have is excellent. The hotel location is also another bonus. It is situated right next to one of the the most recognisable landmarks of Venice - Salute's church and is diagonally opposite St Mark's Square. In spite of that, the area was incredibly quiet and the walk to the Guggenheim collection and the Rialto bridge was a pleasure.

Overall the hotel is charming, comfortable and recommended. The review is written as the hotel, which is very good, could be great. Some tweaks are needed to earn the ratings and rates. The concierge assistance is inconsistent and weak, with little knowledge shared on restaurants and events, and little tailored to preferences of guests. The desk operates more as a friendly reception but not as a concierge. Little annoyances, including stiff towels, frayed unchanged bath robe, plastic wrapped cups in the bathroom, dirty cloth hand rail, again don't fit with a \"luxury\" rating. Similarly, complementary touches such as flowers or chocolates in the rooms, or complimentary evening tea or a drink, are missing at this hotel. Given the lack of an on-site bar, or restaurant, the room service menu could be expanded. The common seating area in the winter, when the small terrace is too cold, is also limited. This is a hotel you want to love and return to, yet the owners/management need to get more involved to ensure an overall quality experience and atmosphere for guests (beyond the stylish decor) and to stay on top of improvements that warrant a \"luxury\" boutique rating, including concierge services.

The room also had a seperate lounge room/study, and the bedroom was stylish and comfortable. AC was great in the August heat. One thing to mention for anyone arriving late at night is that the vaparetto does not stop at the Salute stop outside the hotel late evening. We had a stuggle figuring out how to get to the hotel after arriving in Venice around midnight due to train delays. We eventually figured out that we had to take the night line and get off at the Accademia, from there the hotel was a short walk away following a back street which runs behind the Guggenheim, taking you out to the Salute and the hotel next to it. Wish we had known this in advance, as is never great when you are caught unprepared while you are tired and stressed and this wasnt noted on the hotel website.

The room, up a lot of steep stairs, was nothing special. Also, as you opened the door, there were 4 or 5 steps that immediately went down into the room from the entrance. A horrible accident just waiting to happen, especially at night before you'd have time to put on the lights. Nasty. 'Welcome' drink was a bit tacky, served in the dark and somewhat dank 'lounge' and we were not told about any extra services, such as the honesty bar, which I've read about on this site since. TV only had a couple of local channels. Annoying opera piped onto the terrace at all times - this would be fine if you had the choice to turn it off if you wanted, but not to be forced to listen to it. Staff were 'cordial' but did not do anything in particular to make the stay great. In fact, when we asked for directions to a particular restaurant on our first night, we were almost given 'the brush-off', and made to feel as though we were very stupid for not automatically knowing the names and pronunciations of certain locations en route. When we asked for name of a particular 'campo' to be written down, we were told, 'Oh, I don't need to. Everyone knows it. Just ask someone!. Anyway, it's going to take you a minimum of 25 minutes to walk there. It's a long way from here.' We had asked the hotel to book the restaurant long before our arrival date, so you would expect that this might have been mentioned beforehand, not just as we were setting out and it was starting to get dark. So, overall, a big let-down. When I am paying over 400 euro per night, I expect top service and luxury. Neither of these were delivered.

I realize these things are not very important in the cosmic scheme of things... but since you asked... I booked via emails with the hotel... and had VERY high hopes for a wonderful room as described and shown on their website. I read many positive reviews as well. The Reservations Staff was VERY accomodating and friendly by email (a theme that continued with ALL of the caring staff throughout our stay). Beautiful and clever decorating of the small but warm and comfortable public spaces. Fine breakfast served, at our choice, either in our room, the 2nd floor breakfast salon or a sitting room in the lobby. There were two significant problems, however. We were booked and confirmed in the \"Fireplace Room\" that we requested. They even offered me a nice discount (which I took advantage of) for paying in cash. Just days before our departure for Venice the hotel advised us, by email, that \"we had many troubles and problems with our booking engine\" and that our promised room was not available. They offered an alternative at the same price or a suite for the same price. We accepted the offer of the suite. Upon arrival we learned that the suite was at the top of the hotel, on the 3rd floor (our originally promised room was on the ground floor at canal level). These were VERY high floors (not the traditional 10 ft. stair-length per floor in the States) narrow and with small steps. I have a physical disability that made this Mt. Everest-like everytime. My extremely healthy and exercise-fit wife would also reach the room huffing and puffing. It really colored every trip to and from the room. A second problem... the hotel promised WiFi throughout. It was broken on the 3rd floor. Every, single day, for six days, the reception deskman told me \"Today it will be fixed. He is coming today to fix it.\" Everyday the promise was broken. It was fixed the afternoon before we left Venice. This was problematic in that my vocation requires that I maintain contact through email and my business website at various hours throughout each day... and I couldn't. So... IF the room we were originally promised and that we booked and that was confirmed would have been given to us on the ground floor... and IF the WiFi had worked as promised... I'd be telling you that this was the best boutique hotel experience we've ever had. But it wasn't and it didn't and I can't.

It has a water entrance, so if you're parking your car in the parking lot and have some sizable luggage I would recommend a water taxi and tell them the hotel, they will transport you and your luggage right to the entrance of the hotel and you can avoid lugging you and your luggage through the streets of Venice. we had the 'red' room suite, which was a Venetian experience, the chandelier while not to my personal taste is a construct to behold, excepting for the redness was comfortable, though won't recommend for anyone with allergies as the whole room is covered with fabric and carpet. Also be prepared for the jacuzzi with a shower hose and not enclosed, so if you like showers while it did work fine may not be right for everyone, but if you like baths it would be very enjoyable, beautiful bathroom, roomy for Venice but not conventional, but then it's supposed to be an 'experience'. So while I probably wouldn't stay in the 'red suite' again I would stay at this hotel again. Also service was friendly and helpful, Though we did have to ask for our passports back upon check-in, my understanding with the passports as we travelled through Italy is that the hotels need to type in the information from your passport, but that does not give them the right to keep them.

I called the hotel to make the reservation and explain the importance of the event.

We were greeted by a friendly staff and our bags were taken to our room while we enjoyed homemade icecream and some beverages on this hot day. Just perfect start and we almost licked the bowl clean, ha ha. We were then taken to a delux room, which was very nice, but being the attentive husband that I am I noticed that my wife was hoping for a bathtub so I leaped into action. As my wife was unpacking I excused myself and said I needed to check on some reservations for dinner and went down and talked to one of the extremely helpful men at the reception. I asked if they has any other room and I was offered, for a small charge in my eyes, an upgrade to THE SUITE with a private BALCONY...and a BATHTUB :D I ofcourse accepted and I arranged to take my wife out on some shopping while the staff moved all of our bags to the suite so my wife would be surprised. It all went according to plan and after som shopping my wife and I were lead to our suite which was just breath-taking. Like I mentioned it has a private terrasse where we were served breakfast every morning, a seperate living room where we could unwind and enjoy a bottle of prosecco, 2 fridges stocked with softdrinks and water, a large bedroom, an entrance way....bathroom with a bath....etc etc. Just absolutely gorgeous. The hotel is located at the perfect spot in Veniza. The Vaporetto (large boat which takes you around town) is literaly 2 mins away. The hotel can also arrange for a private water-taxi or gondola if you so chose. The Hotel also made some wonderful suggestions as to where to eat, and the Linea D'umbro on the water by the Hotel was just amazing. We ate there......4 times!!!! We just couldnt help ourselves. They prepared grilled king prawns for us to start, then homemade pasta with lobster in a light sauce....they also had the best seafood soup I have ever tasted ( I am looooove to eat, ha ha).

The first three nights we stayed in Suite 336 with the modern jacuzzi bath at the foot of the bed. We stayed in the Oriental themed room on the final night. The rooms were very different but both were simply perfect - large comfortable kind sized beds, cozy linens and well appointed bathrooms. The common areas of the hotel are stunning as well.

Our every request was met with superb results, whether it was restaurant recommendations, cultural suggestions or simple a great Gelato shop. The staff in particular were extremely impressive.

Venice is a phenomenally expensive city but of all of our expenses the hotel was by far the best value for money.

For the next two nights we stayed in the Doge's room. Opulent, luscious, deep red walls with a fabulous light and bright en-suite with two massive windows onto the street outside. When we arrived we were given two gigantic glasses of Prosecco and some Venetian biscuits while our room was prepared and the lighting adjusted just so for maximum impact. The hotel was an oasis of calm after hours of walking through the crowded streets of Venice. Of all our meals out the best by far was at the Linea D'Ombra restaurant, which the hotel recommends. We had a drink on the terrace overlooking the canal and then retired inside to the contemporary dining room for the meal. The staff were attentive, friendly, and knowledgeable. The food was very good and I would give it 8/10. It is however impossible to judge the restaurant on value for money because every meal and drink we had was exorbitantly priced. It was at least twice as much as we would normally pay for a meal of that quality (\u00c2\u00a3225 for 2 with a single glass of wine each). Surprisingly one of the best cafe drinks we had was in St Mark's Square. \u00c2\u00a39 for a hot chocolate for 1!

The bed was wonderful and the bathroom large with a jacuzzi and fantastic view from the shower. The toiletries were some of the best I've used. Breakfast was probably the best we have had anywhere. There is a wide variety and they also made me something that was not on the menu but I had just written down. Everything was delicious.

We kept interrupting his cigarette breaks when we came back to the hotel at night, but he was always very friendly and charming. The only bad thing I can say is that I did mention when making the reservation that it was our honeymoon, and there was no acknowledgement of that at all. Venice itself was a bit of a disappointment. Besides it being absolutely beautiful and surreal, we thought that it lacked personality. We had been used to lots of lively Italian cities and towns on this trip and in the past, and found Venice to be a little dull. We went out for dinner one night and arrived at a place that was meant to be lively just before 10pm only to find they were closing the kitchen in 5 minutes and we would have to hurry up and order, and then they had barely anything left and I got stuck with something I didn't want. And this was a Friday night! Walking through the town on the way home was beautiful - but completely empty and silent. We were grateful the hotel was in Dorsoduro - the other side of the canal was a circus. Venice is just full of tacky glass and mask shops, with nothing tasteful in sight. We didn't see many restaurants that looked interesting or didn't cater especially for tourists.

What I liked : Location - 150 yards away from the Grand Canal, down a quiet smaller canal. The entrance looks directly at the Santa Maria della Salute (the dome is unfortunately covered in scaffolding at the moment, a shame). The hotel is on Dorsodouro, the opposite side of the Grand Canal to San Marco square, but it is one stop across the water on the Vaporetto. Close enough to the main tourist attractions, but far enough away for some peace and quiet. We would go back to the hotel for a cup of tea and 10 mins rest after a few hours sightseeing. Dorsodouro is also full of interesting art galleries and glass and jewellry shops. Room - We stayed in one of the themed rooms, Sala Noir. Beautifully decorated, a king double with a good mattress and pillows, a great bathroom up some stairs from the bedroom, a mini bar that was always filled with free water and soft drinks. A romantic and peaceful and comfortable room. Staff - helpful, polite, cheerful, efficient. They get it just right. Francesco and Gabriele will look after you. Breakfast - huge choice, you order from a card the night before, all beautiful breads / jams / juices / fruit / yoghurts / honey / eggs / parma ham / cheeses etc. And you can have it in the breakfast room / terrace / lounge / your own room. I was going to write down a list of things we didn't like, but I can't think of anything ! I did ask the hotel to book some restaurants for us, and I agree with a previous reviewer who said there is no need at the moment. The recession and strong euro seem to be biting in Venice, and I didn't see a restaurant that was full up at any time. Of the restaurants that were booked, I'd recommend Lineadombra, a short walk from the hotel, with a terrace with great views of the southern venice islands. Also Al Vecio Forner for authentic and simple italian cuisine. One other thing - the water taxi that the hotel booked for me from the airport was expensive - 180 euros - but super efficient and time saving and a great way to start your trip.

On arrival, we caught a water taxi from the train station directly to the hotel which has its own private landing stage, a member of staff appeared immediately to help with our baggage which was whisked off to our room while we enjoyed a glass of Prosecco in the lounge. The Ca' Maria has 5 themed rooms and 9 other deluxe rooms. We had asked for a deluxe room which gave the best view, and we weren't disappointed. Room 332 is on the top floor and does give a partial view of the Grand Canal through a side window while front windows look directly on to a small canal which runs in front of the Church Santa Maria della Salute. The room itself was generous in size with a beamed ceiling, plasma tv which provided a webcam of the Grand Canal, free minibar and a very comfortable bed (which was a relief after some of the previous Tripadvisor reviews we had read). The bathroom had both bath and shower and was more than adequate. You are given a choice as to where you take your breakfast (you have to specify the night before). You can have this brought to your room, but we opted to eat either on the sun terrace or in the breakfast room, with our choice depending largely on the weather forecast which the hotel provides for the following day. You can have as much or as little as you like (including more Prosecco!) The staff were, without fail, friendly and helpful. You were given the impression that nothing would be too much trouble. The location of the hotel is truly excellent. Dorsoduro is one of the quieter areas of Venice yet you are within easy walking distance of the main art galleries and just one Vaporetto stop away from St Marks Square. Alternatively you can hop on one of the Traghetti (Public Gondolas) which ferry you across the Grand Canal for just 50 cents, both the Vaporetto and Traghetti stops are literally a minute's walk from the hotel. It is very difficult to find anything negative to say about the Ca' Maria. It is certainly on the expensive side, but you would probably expect that of Venice anyway. We did enquire about the hotel organising a Gondola ride and were told it would be 180 Euros for 50 minutes with a bottle of wine included.

Venice is notorious for being a city that shuts down early but if you are like us, in our 30\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s and wanting to enjoy the city after dark, there are loads of young Americans working at the Guggenheim who have their fingers on the pulse of the good places to drink, eat and dance in the city, more so than any guide book, we found, and they are generous with their recommendations, so do ask them.

There are many, many shops and restaurants within 5-10 walking minutes of the hotel and if you want to go over to St. Mark's, you can get there in about 20 mins walk or by taking a water taxi, public water bus, or gondola. Very minor concerns for some might be the very small TV's in the rooms (but who goes to Venice to watch TV, right?), and the beds are a bit hard. And if you want to be able to walk to St. Mark's in one minute or less from your hotel, stay on the other side of the canal. In short, I highly recommend this hotel.

The moroccan style terrace area on the first floor is very quiet, peaceful and a surprise to find - a real sun trap. The breakfast selection is vast and our waitress was delightful. The cleanliness is 100% and the hotel is immaculate. The owners came to see us off on our last day and to shake our hands. A very caring, special hotel and one that I would highly recommend and definitely go back to.

Breakfast was very nice and served ina choice of 4 different areas including your room. You could order Prosecco if you chose to, along with coffee and jucies, rolls ,eggs and many other choices. The only thing we could find to complain of was that the bed although kingsized and full of comfy pillows was very hard. It is true that there is no lift as this is a very old building and must be remodeled according to strict quidelines that does not premit an elevator. A problem for several museums also. the climb up to the 3rd floor at the end of the day was not always what we wanted to do, but the view and comfort of the room made it acceptable.. The bottle of prosecco sent up for our 25th anniversary was a nice touch. One last word about the price. Yes it was expensive but in my research for a place to stay in Venice , I didn't find any hotel that was not expensive and none that came with as many good reviews as the Ca' Maria Adele.

We heard about this secret hideaway in the Mr and Mrs Smith European Hotel guide and decided to treat ourselves to one of the hotel's 5 themed rooms. Previous posts have complained about this particular room and I have to disgaree with all these comments. First, the room is located just around the corner from the reception desk off the lobby and although previous posts complained about noise we didn't find this to be an issue. Second, a previous post complained that the room had no windows, after a little bit of investigation, we managed to find these hidden behind large silk curtains and they opened directly onto the canal with a perfect view of the church of the Santa Maria della Salute opposite. Third, the room has a flat screen TV and DVD player and although not a 42\" plasma it did the job, after all we came to see Venice not Jerry Springer! (Ps: If your essential holiday requirements include yellow taxis, Ice machines and McDonalds then Venice is not for you!) The ensuite was fantastic with a huge walk in shower, but swamp lovers be advised that there is no bath in this suite. The staff were all fantastic and couldn't do enough for us. The Lineadombra restaurant just around the corner from the hotel is excellent and the view from the pontoon terrace across the water is breathaking. The Ca Maria Adele has an excellent roof terrace which is perfect for some afternoon drinking and the quiet non-tourist ambience of the Dorsoduro area of venice is by far the jewel in the crown of the Ca Maria Adele's location. The Salute water bus stop is barely a 2 min walk from the hotel and 2 Euro's each gets you across the grand canal. After 5 mins being pushed and pulled by the tourist masses you will soon realise that the best of Venice is within 10 mins walk of the hotel so it 's really not a problem being on the opposite side of the Grand Canal to the main 'attractions'. If you are staying for 2 days, then it is worth having an afternnon snack on the roof terrace of the Danieli Hotel next to Doges' Palace in San Marco. It opens at 3pm and don't be put off by the grand entrance hall downstairs, just walk straight in and take the elevator to the top floor. The view is excellent as are the lunchtime salads. Finally, a James Bond water taxi direct from the airport to the Ca Maria Adele Lobby is a must. We paid 90 Euro each way and the journey takes about 35 mins.

The hotel is modern and could have been a design firm's offices. The staff were most accomodating, showed us several rooms and offered to discount the price. We moved. The service and rooms are top rate. The value was good (with the negotiated discount that included free mini bar and breakfast). They were prepared to do this as we were walkins and the hotel was not full in March. The staff were able to get us a reservation at a restuarant that the Gritti told us was impossible. I only have two resevations. The first is, like others on here, I too found the beds just way to hard. It is surprising for a new hotel that clearly spent so much money on building the hotel that they would miss so badly on the beds (unless of course you like hard beds). I spend 30 -60 nights a year in hotels on business so I know what I am talking about on the beds. The second issue is that it is on the other side of the Grand Canal from St Marcs. The regular Vapareto stops at about 11 and the night boat does not stop at the hotels stop and is a long wait. This resulted one night after a great but late dinner in us having to take a water taxi, and did we get taken 40 Euro to simply cross the Canal.

We found the location, rooms, ambience and breakfast to be just delightful. We found the breakfast \"girl\" to be most accomodating and interesting. Restaurant recommendations from the front desk too, were outstanding. We booked a concept room for 3 nights. During our stay we found the service to be fine, but unremarkable. Upon check-in, we were given the main floor room, \"the Fireside Room\". The room is lobby level and canal level - just steps from the front desk. We did not understand until the following morning why the room had double entry doors. Because of it's location, that particular room is VERY, VERY noisy in the morning. We were awakened early by staff going in/out of an office or storage closet, talking to guests. It seems like the double door system is to block out the noise. \"The Fireplace room\" while beautiful, is dark and has NO WINDOWS that open or let light in (except in the bathroom) which for me was very claustrophobic. We visited in November, and found that room to be very warm. I cannot imagine what it would be like during the summer months. When we expressed our concern, the staff indicated that they had \"never had a compliant\" before, but promptly switched us to the \"Oriental Room\", which was indeed very lovely, spacious and met our expectations. Windows opened on two sides. I truly felt like a guest in someone's home. I don't know why were were initially booked into the Fireside Room - as there is no comparison between the two suites. One night we also selected a video from the collection available to guests and were given some brief instructions from the front desk staff on how to operate the DVD equipment. Needless to say after many attempts we were not able to get the equipment to operate and contacted the front desk who begrudingly agreed to come look at it. A gentleman arrived, and after 15 minutes of trying, also could not get the equipment to work, shrugged, said sorry \"it doesn't work\" and left. My husband, not to be defeated by technology, continued to work on the equipment, and eventually got it to work. The TVs though flat screen are small - maybe 15\" size. We wandered around the hotel a bit, and found a quiet, upper patio that was a wonderful respite. Again, the front desk or staff could have just taken a few moments to describe the hotel ammenities. During our stay we found the front desk alouf and perhaps a bit too impressed with themselves or the success of their hotel. Do make sure you have clear directions on how to get to the hotel to provide to vaporetto drivers. Ca' Maria Adele is a unique, beautiful, small hotel.

Boats come every 10 minutes or so every day from dawn until 11pm or so. There is a night line with different hours also but we didn't use it. There are many nice restaurants within a short 10 minute walk in the Dorsoduro and along the Zattere.

I stayed in a deluxe room. The room was a good size with a small seating area and, what appeared to be, a brand new bathroom. The room was spotlessly clean and very tasteful. I had been told that I had been allocated a room with a view of the canal before I arrived but was given a one overlooking the garden but it didn't matter at all. Breakfast was lovely and more than ample. The service was fast and friendly. The location is marvellous. It is quiet and yet very close to the main attractions. It is situated in a lovely area of the city. I would recommend anyone to stay at this hotel.

They have lots of little personalized touches, with rose petals at turndown, nice bath products, and robes and slippers. The breakfast was good and plentiful and they serve it in a sunny room upstairs. We woke up every morning to the smell of pastries cooking, which made it easy to get out of bed, and also made you feel like you were staying in some aristocrat's home. We also really liked the location, which has some tourists during the day, but they all clear out at night and it is very quiet. We asked the concierge to recommend a nice restaurant for us, and they sent us to a an amazing restaurant that was out of the main tourist area, and served traditional Venetian seafood. We had tiny fried softshell crabs, a venetian specialty only available in June.

Having read the excellent reviews on Tripadvisor and visited their excellent web-site (--------) this seemed to be exactly what we were looking for being quiet, intimate, luxurious and \u00e2\u20ac\u0153characterful\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. It certainly was all four. This is a small hotel having only 14 rooms in all. Having booked one of their five \u00e2\u20ac\u0153themed rooms\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, we were initially given the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Fireplace Room\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd for the first night but were offered the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Oriental Room\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd for the remainder of our stay. As this gave us the chance to experience more than one of what appeared to be a unique style of accommodation we accepted. (See photographs). On arrival we were treated to a welcoming glass of Champagne served with passion fruit which exemplified the first class attention you receive at this hotel. The rooms were excellent though I must agree with other reviews that the beds seem universally \u00e2\u20ac\u0153firm\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd and I do mean \u00e2\u20ac\u0153firm\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd! and took a little getting used to. Furnishings throughout the hotel are luxurious and the extensive use of scented candles burning, it appeared, throughout the day as well as evening added to the magical atmosphere. Breakfast is taken in a room overlooking the Church of Santa Marie della Salute and again continues the unique charm of this hotel. Apart from a small buffet of cereals and fresh fruit there is a choice of beverages; fruit juices and egg dishes together with hams and bacon. A selection of rolls and croissants is also offered. The small \u00e2\u20ac\u0153living-room\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd has a great atmosphere and is a haven of tranquillity. A great place to enjoy a pre- or post dinner drink or just a quiet coffee. The hotel itself lies at one end of the Sestiere Dorsoduro and is located on a small canal and opposite the Basillica of San Salute. This is a very quiet area yet is only 2 minutes by Vaporetto (water bus) from St Marks Square. The Vaparetto stop is only 50 meters or so from the hotel. Though pricey, I would personally recommend a transfer between the airport and hotel by taxi as, apart from the convenience of door to door and the enjoyment of the water trip itself, the prospect of negotiating the water buses with luggage did not appeal. Even in late March they are VERY crowded. The staff are very friendly and always anxious to please without being overwhelming. I have stayed in many hotels (luxurious and otherwise) in various parts of the world but there are only a very few which I would describe as magical. The Swan in Lavenham, England; The Portmerion Hotel in Wales and certainly the Ca\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 Maria Adele in Venice. It is unique. If you are looking for a real experience rather than just \u00e2\u20ac\u0153somewhere to stay\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd I would thoroughly recommend this hotel however in doing so I realise it may make it more difficult to book there again!", "Date": "April 1, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "4", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "LONDON", "Title": "\u201cIf you want quiet in Venice\u201d", "Author": "TORRAN1", "ReviewID": "UR4600473", "Content": "The water taxi takes guests straight to the door of this wonderful boutique hotel, situated next to Santa Maria de Salute at the entrance to the Grand Canale.
