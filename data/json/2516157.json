The bathrooms were nice and clean. There is a convenience store across the street, which is.....convenient. And, it is just two minutes from downtown.

It was in her price range and not too far from our hotel. When we got to Phoenix, we helped her check in and what not. She's handicap, so she needed some help. The first thing i noticed was that there were almost no food places within walking distance for her to go to. Also, there were no criminal looking people around, but the neighborhood was the type where all the buildings had bars on the windows. I was a little put off by this since my toddler son was to stay with my mom for a couple hours while my husband and I attended a wedding. The you folks working in the lobby were very nice and courteous, but then an older man, who i think was the manager or owner, came from the back to \"help\" the girl at the front desk. She was training. He was rude and gruff, in my opinion. He had a half blind dog with him and every few seconds he would interupt the booking process to yell \"stay!\" at the poor dog. Then we were informed by him that, in addition to the room cost, which was paid through hotels.com, there would be a $100 old on my mom's debit card. He said it may take a \"few days\" to be refunded, but the sign behind him said it could take up to 10 days. By the time I noticed that, he had already done it. Then he told the front desk clerk to put my mom in an upstairs room. I was like, \"she's handicap.\" He was all, \"well there's nothing about that in the reservation\", like i was lying. He reluctantly put her in a downstairs room. Maybe the fact that we were parked in a handicap spot convinced him she was really handicap. We took my mom to the room. To be honest, it wasn't as dirty and ghetto as I thought it would be. It was satisfactory. I'm sure if I would've stuck around long enough I might have found something to eerk me, but my mom seemed content with it, so we moved on.
