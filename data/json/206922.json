Se we had got a weekend special deal, 4 nights with breakfast, I full empty of mini bar & 1730 late check out all for \u00a3310. Quite a good deal. So we got a high-ish level as we requested this in our booking (we both like a good view & high floors are generally quiter right?) not here, the noise is a bit of a prob mainly because of inconsiderate guests who don't realise how thin the walls are!! Also quite a lot of street noise once woken! They provide you with 1 pillow each so I asked for more which wasn't a prob. So breakfast.....lovely lady looking after the buffet of traditional Catalan spread of yummy cured meats, breads, amazing choc drink, juicy fresh cut fruit, great tea selection, fresh perfect scrambled eggs, Spanish donuts & perfect mini pastry selection. I run a resturant & I really enjoyed this part of our stay. The Fully stocked mini bar contained 2 beers, 2 waters, 2 cokes & 2 more pop cans + 1 bag of crisps so if you are hoping for a knees- up room party then it's not that type of mini bar as it could have been perseved on line. The bathroom & shower were fine & all other room facilities were good. Reception team helpfully if you need them. Free 30 wifi daily for guests in reception area. Kind reception man also helped with local tapas sujestion & printed our birding pass out for us. All in all a good place to stay but take note of my points before you book C&G", "Date": "April 16, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Parma, Italy", "Title": "\u201cnice biz hotel\u201d", "Author": "Toyaz", "ReviewID": "UR125372287", "Content": "i stayed here during the mobile world congress, the hotel is in a goofd locatiom, close to the metro, rooms are decent and clean, staff at the reception is firendly and collaborative, breakfast is OK and price affordable. good if you're on a business trip", "Date": "February 28, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Edinburgh, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cAverage\u201d", "Author": "KR_EDINBURGH", "ReviewID": "UR120339819", "Content": "Stayed just one night and paid 120 euros for standard room.

Here is how I find this hotel: Positive: 1. Close to city center (5 minutes walk to subway stations, from there 2 stops to the heart of town) 2. Good neighborhood - seemed safe, close to shops/cafes 3. Clean (towels and bed sheets were very clean; excellent daily cleaning service!) 4. Price was reasonable for 92 euros tax included per night for one room Negative: 1. Mattress - our mattress was not particularly comfortable, it felt like there is a cut width wise in the middle of the mattress 2. Paying extra 10.5 euros per day for Internet in the room and extra 16 euros per person for breakfast Note: 1. Breakfast is simple, not a large variety, yet enjoyable - 16 euros a day a bit too much, but you can book it in advance and get it for 8-10 euros per person 2. With north-American standards, rooms are small, for us the size was acceptable 3. Walls are thin, you will definitely hear your neighbors;) we didn't mind that 4. Staff are good - not too warm and welcoming but they do their job well 5. Although you have to pay an extra 10.5 for 24 hours of Internet in your room, the hotel offers a free half an hour Internet connection in the lobby We had a certain budget for our trip; with the same budget, I would again stay at this hotel.
