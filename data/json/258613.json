I travelled to Florence alone as a friend is living there at the moment. I wanted to stay somewhere that was very central and close to my friends apartment. This def met both of these requirements.You cant ask to be more central the duomo is directly opposite and from the breakfast room the view from the balcony is truly amazing. Other sites such as the square with the replica of the statue of david  sante croce are only a short walk away and the main shopping street is very close, as is the leather market. The train and coach station are within easy reach with regular trains to piza, milan, sienna, bologne and even rome.As for the hotel this was lovely. It is on the 4th floor however theres a lift if you dont want to walk up the stairs. The fact the hotel is on the 4th floor makes the views so much better. The staff are really lovely, they are friendly, helpful and very good at speaking english. The continental breakfast was lovely and the breakfast room was kept clean and tidy.The room was lovely, very clean and modern it even had a flat screen tv.

This hotel is an excellent value for a 3-star hotel in Florence. It was much cheaper than any other 3-star property I could find, especially considering the location right next to the Duomo. You couldn't get any more central. Also, the hotel is on the high end of 3-star hotels, even for North American standards. The room had probably recently been redone with lovely wood floors and comfy paneling above the bed. The minibar was super cheap. Only things I would say keeping it from 4-star are the quality of the bed and sheets (a little hard) and the shower (very small and every 30 seconds water slows to a trickle). Everything was spotlessly clean and the receptionists very helpful.

Refrigerator in the room, safety lock-box in the room, very nice bathroom (especially for an Italian hotel!!!), air conditioning, and a small balcony with a breathtaking view of the church and dome.

Wife and I just got back from our honeymoon and stayed at the Hotel Duomo.Overall, we enjoyed this hotel and would stay here again.One thing to note was how close to the Duomo it was. Its right across the street. This presents both good and bad things. One, the view was AMAZING- you walk onto the balcony and look out and up to the Duomo. The downside to that is that this particular Piazza, the kids like to hang out there at night till at least 1:30am. Even with the hotel on the 4th floor, it still created alot of noise- the kids, the cars, and sirens. Therefore, we couldnt leave the door open at night for the view nor for the cool night weather.Another thing to note: the room was very roomy for European standards, two twin beds together to make a queen size. BUT, the bathroom did not have a built in shower- it was one of those create a shower in the bathroom via shower curtain. This wasnt bad but strange for such a large bedroom to have a very tiny bathroom.The hotel service was great. The hotel made reservations for us to one of the major museums and recommended how to handle getting into the Uffizi Gallery (the reservations was booked till a month in advance and we waited an hour to get in).The location was excellent.
