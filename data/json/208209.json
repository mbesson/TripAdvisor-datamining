You had to jump over the suitcases. I complained to the reception since I had reserved a \"Comfort room\" versus a \"basic room\" . I told them this room had to be a basic room because they could not have anything smaller. After some discussion, they admitted they had made a mistake and they would give us another room. The new room was of a good size, it was in the second floor almost on top of the hotel entrance door. We noticed that the air vents were blowing warm air. My wife called reception and requested to have the air condition system set correctly since the room was too warm. A bell boy came and adjusted it. At 3 am, we could not sleep because of the heat in the room. I opened the large window to the street and the fresh air came in but also the noise of the cars and the conversation of the people in the sidewalk. Since we had just arrived after a 10 hour flight, eventually we went to sleep. Next morning my wife complained to reception and we were told that they were very sorry but the air conditioning was not working on the second floor. Why did you give us that room? Well we did not have any other one available. They gave us another room in the fifth floor (the club level) It was of the same dimensions, but had air conditioning and on the corridor it had an expresso coffee machine, pastries and news papers for free. The next four days were good. They also comp that mornings breakfast (expensive but we were too tired to go outside the hotel). Location is fantastic. On Fridays and Saturdays they have a jazz band playing in the lobby. Security is very good (you need your key to operate the elevator).

The rooftop pool was not as nice as we thought it would be, a bit dirty and extremely cold (in the middle of August). There was also a strong smell of dampness/mould in the lobby.

We stayed for a week. Didn't eat there. The rooms are fine, but not worth the price we paid, and I've stayed in a lot of (both very fancy, and very ordinary) hotels. I would go as far to say that I was disappointed (we had a Solarium room, and it was nowhere NEAR the size it appears on the webpage). The staff, with the exception of one doorman who was friendly, helpful and cheerful, were illmannered, unfriendly, and only helpful insofar as their job went, never going above or beyond. We needed a late checkout and were treated very rudely about it, and lied to, despite our willingness to pay for the privilege. Either way... there are a few places to eat and drink around about the area, but be prepared to walk. There's a GREAT bar at the corner, up the road from the hotel that does good sangria and tapas, and v friendly owners/staff... but it's closed on Sundays and public holidays, so be aware (if you come out of the hotel, turn right, walk one block up, diagonally opposite you there's a bar on the corner... recommended... mainly peopled by locals too). Despite being on the 6th floor, we could still hear the rumble of the metro underneath, and it was a good thing that pretty much all of the other rooms on that floor were empty, because the 2 nights that we had neighbours, the (normal) noises from their rooms came through the walls no problem. The rooms were more-or-less cleaned, however behind the doors were never vacuumed, from what I can see, and there were open safety pins on the floor that weren't picked up. Despite ringing ahead to pre-advise our check-in, and to organise a surprise fruit basket and cava for my other half (we were celebrating our anniversary), the room wasn't available (despite the floor being more than 2/4 empty), the \"basket\" didn't arrive until 2 hours later, and all it consisted of in the end was a plate with some under-ripe kiwis, apples and over-ripe strawberries... a total rip-off.

The room was lovely, with a lovely marbled bathroom and towells for the pool also, CD player, TV, coffee making facilities. Unfortunately our air con wasn\u2019t working on the first night so we had a word with reception the following morning who said somebody would take a look straight away and we headed off out for the day. That evening it still wasn\u2019t fixed so we complained again and the reception guy came up, very friendly and got us moved to another room. We asked for a quiet room initially and insisted we did this time. We got given one at the back and it was clearly an upgraded room, even better than the first, separate lounge area, bigger bath, HUGE bed! slippers, dressing gown etc. Both rooms have minibar. The roof top pool is great, only small but was quiet at all times, given there was only about 12 sun loungers there were always spare ones and open till 9pm (Summer) so after a long day sight seeing we sat up on the roof around 8pm in the sunshine which was perfect. Only thing missing is a bar up there, there is a small outlet but this appeared to be only open some of the time. the vending machine wasnt working either but we took our own drinks up with us. The reception staff were extremely helpful and friendly, helping us with tickets for the Bus Turistic (open top bus) which gets you 2 euros off if you purchase at reception and a map etc. I cannot mark the restaurant as i didnt use it so although I have marked \u201c1\u2033 this is because there is no option for N/A. Great location for everything. Come out of the hotel, turn right and walk straight down (or down the various interesting side streets) and within 10 mins you\u2019re at passage de gracia, calalunya square and then onto la rambla. Near enough to get to on foot but far enough away not to be disturbed by street noise. We did ask for a quiet room and were on the 3rd floor, it was quiet all night and perfect. I gather the metro maybe goes underneath the hotel as there is a noise every 5 mins or so but I only noticed this whilst sat in reception. Taxi to and from the airport was between 25 and 30 euros and the taxi rank was right outside the hotel. Only thing I would have liked is perhaps more of a selection of room service including a drinks menu or another casual bar, as there is one hotel bar but on the evening we actually did stay in there was a cocktail evening on which you had to reserve a table. We chose that night to sit up by the pool instead and had a bottle of cava from the minibar! Free safe in the room which was very good.

This year it was decided that Barcelona should be the venue. Prior to making all the travel arrangements, I carried out my normal practice of using Trip Advisor to check out our intended hotel. On this occasion it was The Silken Gran Havana Hotel, Grand Via Corts Catalanes, 647 . The write- ups seemed okay and the booking was made.The stay occured between 3th and 5th January 2011. Having arrived at Barcelona airport it was decided to use the Aerobus that moves between the airport and the centre of the city. The cost for four people was some 22 Euros, which seemed a good deal. It also gives you the chance to begin to experience the buzz of the city. As it turned out, a taxi from the hotel to the airport was 26 Euros. The bus took us to the Place de Catalunya which is literally the city centre.From the Place de Catalunya, along Gran Via Corts to the hotel was a walk of about 20 minutes with cases. Not a problem. From the time of getting off the bus, you become aware of the enormous amount of people moving about . There was a terrific atmosphere of people shopping, strolling and enjoying the Christmas atmosphere that still existed,helped by the beautiful christmas decorations everywhere. The entrance to the hotel is both elegant and welcoming. The foyer is large and open, and ones attention is immediately drawn to the way in which the centre of the foyer is open to the roof top and each floor can be seen leading off from the glass covered space which made up what was almost a funnel effect. Most effective and different. The foyer was beautifully decorated with a huge christmas tree, and later when it got dark, it was discovered that the whole of the front of the hotel was illumnated by beautiful lights.Magical. The staff at the reception desk were very attentive and gave the impression that nothing was too much trouble. The booking in process was painless and assistance was given if needed with carrying luggage to the room.We stayed on the sixth floor which is the top floor before the roof top swimming pool. The rooms were large, well appointed and scrupulously clean.The bed was extremely comfortable with ample pillows. There was tea making facilities, a mini bar and safe. The large flat screen TV. had several english speaking channels and a separate radio/cd player.Well up to a four star standard. The bathroom was pure luxury. Each bed room had a sizeable individual balcony, access to which was through french windows, which in turn gave additional light into the room. On the balcony was a table, two chairs and sun loungers (perfect for a summer visit to enjoy the gin and tonic on!) . The breakfast room was large and had a variety of seating arrangements. The selection and variety of food avaliable for breakfast was immense.The staff were very attentive, and moved quickly and efficiently to ensure there were always freshly laid tables available. As we were only going to be in the city for two whole days, it was decided to use the hop on /off tourist bus service, called Barcelona Bus Touristic. You cannot miss the buses, which are either coloured blue or red with open tops(which can be covered over in inclement weather - we didn't have any). The reception staff were able to provide us with introductory packs for the bus, which meant that when we bought our tickets, a discount was given on the full price.You can buy tickets at the places where the buses stop, which are indicated by a distinct type of bus stop.The Bus Turistic is excellent value for money and has two distinct routes. One route takes in the city centre area, and the other the suburbs which includes the mountain area overlooking the city (must be visited, particularly if you have children).It is the usual hop off/on service and the waiting time between each bus is never more than 10-15 minutes. As there is so much to see in and around the city, it is worth buying a two day ticket . With the discount given, a one day ticket is 20 Euros whereas a two day ticket is 27 Euros. Excellent value As the buses cannot go down Las Ramblas and the market areas off both sides, it is worth spending some time on foot in this area before using the tourist bus . When it came to finding a place for dinner, the list was endless.We had already been recommended to visit 4CATS Restaurant which is just off Las Ramblas, which was within a fifteen minute walk of the hotel. A table was booked during the day which was fortunate, because the place was crowded out. The food, service and atmospshere made for an excellent evening. For the second evening we called upon the hotel to recommend an eating place. A restaurant called Ca La Nuri some ten minuites walking time from the hotel was recommended and a booking made . The evening ws a tremendous success with good food and excellent service. At lunch on the last day, before getting back to the airport we stumbled upon yet another excellent eating place, again only minutes from the hotel called Tasca & Beer. Excellent service, food and good value. It was soon time to call to an end our short break and return to the cold of the U.K. A marvellous short stay which was made even better by the experience of The Gran Hotel Havana and its staff , coupled with so many things to see and do.

The short answer is that is a decent room with a comfy bed that was cleaner looking and feeling than my balcony cabin on the cruise ship. Better than I expected from a European hotel given all the horror stories I was told. The only reason I wouldn't stay there again was because it's not as close to Passeig de Gracia (the street everything is on) as some reviews lead you to believe. Now for the details if you're interested.... Shocker, my plane landed an hour early and customs only took as long as stamping my passport. Not a long wait for my bag either and traffic from the airport to the hotel at 8:00 in the morning is minimal so I arrived at my hotel by 8:30 a.m. Check in isn't until 3:00. The people at the counter stored my suitcase, but told me 1:00 was the earliest I could expect a room, go explore the city. Being out of it because of the whirl, it took me an hour to realize that I was hot, swollen, icky, hungry and hadn't used a bathroom in about 4 hours. It would have been nice if, when storing my bags, they had offered me the use of a courtesy suite or bathroom so I could change my clothes, put some sunscreen on and wash up a little even if all I did was splash my face. After walking around Barcelona for 3 hours and grabbing some breakfast, I needed some air conditioning so I headed back to rest in their lobby. Whether they wanted me out of the lobby because I looked like heck at this point or they really did have a room ready early, they hailed me around 11:30 and put me in my room. At first the room was stuffy, but a quick read of the book by my bed told me how the control worked and I adjusted the temp. The bathroom was adequate and not hard to use except that it took me 2 days to figure out how to open and close the drain in the tub w/o pulling it up by hand. I like that you can turn on the shower from a knob on the side of the tub so you aren't instantly hit in the face with cold water. All showers should be this way. Lots of toiletries to steal. I was on the first floor and never heard the metro, but I did hear businesses putting trash in the big bins outside my window most of the night and people talkings in the street. Explored the roof top pool/bar where they serve light meals most of the day. Also home of a vending machine that sells bottled water for 2 Euro (the cheapest I saw on my trip). Pool isn't as tiny as a jacuzzi, but 6 people would leave it standing room only. I read somewhere that it was \"fancy\" up there and made swimming awkward, but it was very casual. The sandwich I had was good and reasonably priced. Good view of the city and both tables with umbrellas and lounge chairs to sit on. Every staff member I met spoke English, and I think the \"uninterested\" comment is because there is sometimes a translation lag. They joked with me and gave me directions when needed. That night I ate in the Grand Place, the restaurant downstairs. I opens at 8 p.m., I waited until 8:30, and was alone in there until 9:10. I knew they ate late, but I was starving and was messed up on my times to begin with. Food was great, but they charge for bread and don't tell you. Not much, couple Euros, but beware. Also the Flan Havana isn't like normal Flan, I could had drank it with a straw. The next day I did breakfast there because it was included with my room. As it was included, it was ok, but if it's not part of your room's price don't bother. A very small buffet filled with unlabled foods that weren't always identifiable. I'm not an egg eater, I prefer a pastry and tea or milk, but if you like eggs you won't find them here. Fruit choices change daily. I had chocolate croissants and fruit both mornings. I should note they don't seem to know what to do with solo diners, always flustered to find me a table for one. Must not be thing in Spain. What I also noticed was that on Saturday when I got to breakfast at 9:00, it was kind of picked over, but the shops don't open until a not very prompt 10:00 (more like 10:10) even though everyone will tell you they open at 9:30-10:00. When I got up earlier on Sunday for my cruise transfer there was a bigger selection at breakfast. Take your pick: more food with time to kill before you can do anything or less food and right out to shop. On my first full day there, Saturday, I went shopping and discovered that it was a 3 block walk to reach Passeig de Gracia (didn't notice the day before) and then you had to walk the length of that street in either direction to see it all. Going back to the hotel I noticed the crowds thinned out and the neighborhood was less...nice. Still not bad looking, but it's not as reassuring as what I left behind on P de G. That really struck me after dark when it was time to eat. There are no quick, 5 step places to eat near the Havana beyond the hotel restaurant and the rooftop bar. A few fancy places a block or 2 away, but as I was a woman alone, I didn't like walking 2 blocks in the dark. Had I stayed at a place on P de G, I could have found a restaurant everywhere I looked and never walked a block. The up side is that I didn't encounter beggars who may or may not have been scam artists trying to see where my wallet was every time I left the hotel and when walking on P de G, I saw they outside most hotels. People say it's quieter being off the main strip, but there is still noise. When all is said and done, if I had it to do over, I would have stayed at a hotel on Passeig de Gracia so I spent less time walking and more time seeing things.", "Date": "August 11, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Manchester, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cFantastic Hotel - best in Barcelona\u201d", "Author": "Ebbs88", "ReviewID": "UR74129050", "Content": "We just returned from a week at the Silken Gran hotel Havana, What a fantastic hotel, We payed \u00a3646 for 7 nights in a basic room, it was a lovely cool room with a nice view overlooking the street, I was a little skeptical about staying there as i heard the metro underneath was proving an issue for some guests but this seriously isn't bad as some people have made out, we were staying on the 3rd floor and you can barely here it.

We spent really much time searching for a hotel to book since we were going to spend 8 whole days in the city and we didn't want to get disappointed. We checked almost all hotels in Barcelona through trip advisor and chose Silken Havana at the end. I must admit that we made the right choice. The hotel was very well located. Only 5 minutes walk from \"Girona\" metro station and 10 minutes walk from the \"Passeig De Gracia\" metro station & street which is the most popular shopping/ elegant street of the city (with Gaudi masterpieces). La Rambla was only 15 minutes walk as well as Plaza Catalunya. During our stay and our tour around the city we spotted the other hotels we were looking before booking, and Havana was the best by far (especially due to its location). The neighbourhood of the hotel wasn't dangerous at all during the night. As far as the room is concerned, we booked the \"Solarium\" room on the 6th floor (room Nr.605). Really clean & modern. It was also and excellent choice because in that height you avoid the traffic noise. Especially room 605 facing Carrer Del Bruc was pretty quiet. We also requested a king size bed just to be sure beforehand that we will have a good sleep. It was perfect! Something really nice was also the jazz nights they organise once in a month. If you are lucky you might attend one. Furthermore, once in a week they have great piano nights. As for the terrace, it was really beautiful (with nice view at Tibidabo hill) although we hadn't time to spend there (there are so many other MUSTDO things in Barcelona than sitting in the hotel terrace). I went upstairs just to take some pictures. The only thing I didn't like was that the terrace closes at 9 - 10 o clock! It would be nice to have a late drink, up there after your Barcelona evening walks. Regarding breakfast, I must admit that it was not the best I've ever had. Our reservation was made without including the breakfast by purpose and that was another good decision. It was very expensive. They were asking 20 euros per person, per day, so that meant 40 euros per day per couple for having just breakfast! We had everyday a nice \"Starbucks\" (2 in the area) breakfast for 15 euros both! I went only one morning alone to try the breakfast by curiosity and that's why I mentioned that it was not the greatest I have ever had. Regarding the reception customer service, well...it was not what you expect from a 4 star hotel but I didn't really bother. They just didn't spoke English very well and they didn\u2019t provided us with any usefull suggestions for restaurants etc. I particularly asked them if a restaurant I have chosen (from a tourist guide list) was nice and they just respond: \"\u0399f you have planned to have dinner there, then do so\".

The underground car park is up a one way street against the flow of traffic from the main road so you'll need to drive around the block, the car park itself is very poorly signed and don't expect to arrive in a sports car as the gradient down to the sub-terranian area is very steep indeed - it could be signed better and better direction / advice given in this regard but other than that a great facility although expensive at \u20ac28 per night even for residents. Hotel itself, is a grand facade of a modern and artistic clean facility in the heart of the city within fifteen minutes walk of the main attractions and / or the tourist red route bus for the less energetic, alternatively \u20ac5 in a taxi will get you most places. The staff are polite and attentive speaking several languages, on request we were upgraded to an executive level room which was rather pleasant and spacious. As ever the Spanish don't seem to understand airconditioning and in winter the unit blows hot air which is no use if you are from colder climates, apparently the system can not cope with both and is set to a winter or summer mode but hey there's a window to open and the inner residential courtyard is pleasantly quiet. However for some bizarre reason in such an old solid building the sound travels between rooms, you hear the people above in the toilet and cleaners vacuums on the carpet which can be a pain but isn't a nuisance... a few shortcomings in the executive area or shall I say empty pastries cabinet and tempromental Nespresso coffee maker with two seats... The in room entertainment is very limited for this type of hotel, just local TV channels with some world news options but do try the i/ii button in the evenings for original language dual broadcasts. We had a load of hassle with our room cards in regard to the lift operation... Unless you have a fat wallet don't eat nor drink in the hotel as there are many bars nearby and restaurants, Barcelona itself is a very expensive place but at \u20ac6 for a draught small lager frankly \"no way hose A\" which is in the nearby supermarket for \u20ac0.50 or other bars at half the price - eat out, drink out, sleep in. The bar steward tried to \"fizz up\" flat champgane as he poured it and I mean f-l-a-t which at \u20ac10.50 a glass was not acceptable, an immediate complaint however was made and a new bottle opened so problem resolved... but should never have happened.

The location is a mere 3 blocks (10-15mins walk) from Placa de la Catalunya at the top of Las Ramblas). We strolled from here, past the square, via Casa Bootlia, La Pedrera, on to Sagrada Famila in no time at all. An ideal location where we never felt at risk at night. Locaiton, location, location. The double room itself was immaculate. On the 2nd floor right above the main entrance to the hotel gave a nice city view although this was compromised by the fact that it was on a main street (Grand Via de las Catalunyas). If you want location in Barca, you're gonna have to live with some street noise! Well appointed, well lit & modern with a crisp large bathroom which included a bath & shower. Housekeeping was great. After our first night we lay in & housekeeping arrived 3 times attempting to clean the room.... even as late as 17:00 hours! Excellent. The only faults with housekeeping were: we ran out of tissues (not toilet paper, tissues) and these were not replenished. Given other reviews, I did listen out for the Metro trains running beneath the hotel. If you listen for it you will hear it... possibly even feel it: but it in no way impinged on our well deserved good nights' sleep. There are tea & coffee making facilities but for some reason the only coffee provided was decoffee(ie)nated. Mini bar was well stocked & well priced given where we were. Reception/Concierge staff were happy, smiling & keen to help though a little short on detail (\"Is it safe here at Night?\".... \"That depends.\"... \"On what?\"... on whether you are walking or in a taxi.\".... \"OK, walking here late at night.\"... \"Well, that depends.\"... \"On what?\"... \"On where you are walking from.\"... and so the story went on. Security is well managed with staff at the front door and the need to use your room card to operate the lift. Having said that, we did have friends in the wee hours come up to our room for a late drink with no questions asked. When one of us walked in to the hotel at about 11pm explaining that the other had the room keys we were shown directly to the stairs with no inquiry.... I guess they just recognised my face! On Fri/Sat evenings they advertise a \"Cocktails & Swing\" evening. Worth a quick drink but no more than that. As ever, careful in Barca. This hotel is clean, well presented & in a prime location just a couple of blocks off the beaten path.

We got a half price deal on Lastminute.com and paid just \u00a356 per room per night so I guess, on that basis, I thought it was excellent for the money - but given the average cost of a half decent in central Barcelona these days, even at full price it would still have been reasonable. Foyer area is OK, a little dated as some people have said. The glass atrium is impressive, but didn't really have quite the Wow factor I was hoping for based on the website. Our room was a double, and I'd read on here that all the doubles faced a brick wall so was expecting the worst. However we had a reasonable view over a central garden/courtyard type area which, although quite functional looking, at least meant that plenty of light came into the room. The room itself was very small, but perfectly adequate and very nicely decorated. Modern, clean and comfortable, which is all you really need from a mid priced city centre hotel. There was also a good audio system and a 26\" LCD TV. We were on the 3rd floor but did not experience any road or Metro noise. Bathroom was a good size, shower was good, very powerful, excellent range of toiletries supplied. Hairdryer was one of those dodgy ones that hang on the wall with a hose affair attached, like a Hoover, so take your own if you prefer a decent one! The best bit for me was the kettle. So few Mediterranean hotels have these. But bring your own tea bags as you don't get many and they looked a bit dubious! Also, had to ask for extra sugar and milk at the bar on the 2nd day as this was not replenished , yet the toiletries were! It was no bother though and the barman gave us a jug of fresh milk which we then kept in the fridge (another useful facility!) The wifi did require a username and password every 24 hours but again this was no big deal, reception was never that busy, and when we phoned one morning to ask for the details, they said they were too complicated to read out over the phone, but offered to bring them to the room instead. And sure enough a porter arrived with a printout 10 minutes later! Which was pretty good service I thought. The rooftop pool area and terrace are very nice. Not quite up to Hotel 1898 standard but not bad at all. (The Hotel 1898 is on the Ramblas and is amazing, but you need a second mortgage to stay there, so for special occasions only unless you manage to get a bargain. Non residents can use the rooftop bar though and I highly recommend a visit) . Pool is small and only about a metre deep but fine for cooling off after a lie in the sun. There are only about 10 sunbeds so, whilst we didn't have a problem getting one ourselves, I can see how it might be an issue at busy times. The deck area round the pool is good though so you could lie there, or bring a chair up from the terrace where there are many tables, chairs and brollies. On the downside, the ice cream/food/drink kiosk didn't open while we were there which was a bit of a shame if we'd wanted lunch or something, and the drink vending machine gave me Coke even though I pressed the Fanta button! All in all a nice area though, and pool towels are supplied in the room which is great. There is also a good shower room by the pool with toiletries which you can use on your last day after you've checked out. Very handy. Location-wise, this hotel was a little further from the Ramblas than I was expecting, but even so, still only a 15 min walk to the top, by the Place de Catalunya. However, the Metro is brilliant and I highly recommend you use that. Clean, fast and efficient. And ridiculously cheap. We got a T10 ticket which gives you 10 journeys over as many days as you like (I think they are valid for a month) for just 7.70 Euros. Plus, you can also use the T10 to get to or from the airport on the RENFE which goes every half hour on the grey line. This was also really easy and whilst we didn't use it when we arrived, we did use it to get back to the airport with our remaining 'journey', so in effect the trip was free, as opposed to costing around 30 Euros in a taxi! One thing to note though, if you get on at the Passeig de Gracia (the nearest RENFE station to the hotel), it's a bit of a long walk to the platform once you're under ground so allow an extra 15 mins more than you'd expect.

The reception staff were very friendly and helpful and there is a nice bar area on the ground floor. The hotel has rooftop sundeck and pool, which was great after a day of sightseeing / shopping. They also provide in your rooms towels to use. There is also a sauna and you just have to advise reception when you want to use it. In terms of location the hotel is very central and we managed to walk everywhere. It is only about 5 / 10 minute walk to the Passeig de Gracia / Placa Catalunya / Ramblas and about 5 minute walk to the nearest metro. We got the bus from the airport and it took us 10 minutes max from Placa Catalunya. Being so central there are several good bars and restaurants nearby.

The Gran Havana couldn't be more central. We were close enough to the centre of all amenities, but far enough away for it not to be noisy. We used a two day pass with Bus Touristic which was exceptionally beneficial as we could not have seen all the things we wanted to have had we not have done this. You can use the buses as a hop on hop off service and see all the tourist attractions ar your leisure. Buses come along every 7-15 minutes, which was fantastic. We saw everything we wanted to see and more. Highly recommend this! We did a lot of walking as well but walking alone you could not see all the sites. We ate at a wee Itialian called Gino's, which was gorgeous and very reasonably priced considering the price of the Euro at the moment. We also ate at a place called 'Brown' which was quite posh, but again, faultless food. Our last night we went to the Hard Rock Cafe, and if you love music, cocktails and excellent food then this is the place to go. Read up (a lot!!!) on Barcelona prior to going and had concerns about the pickpocketers and back snatching but never had any problems with this at all or felt threatened om the slightest.

We could walk everywhere, even as far as Port Vell. When tired, the Metro was a couple of blocks away. One tip: avoid La Rambla. Our first afternoon, I caught a pickpocket with her hand in my pocket. She just laughed and walked on. there was no police presence. Her and her partner were posing as tourists with map, guudebook etc. I was on alert though. We spent the afternoon spotting pickpockets at work, including my own protagonist. Why do the police tolerate this? Even with this, Barcelona is a fantastic city and ranks with the best. Shopping, especially in the narrow streets east of La Rambla is probably among the best - right up there with Berlin and more affordable than Paris.
