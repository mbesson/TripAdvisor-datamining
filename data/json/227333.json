Not a very big hotel/inn but that's what makes it nice. They had a nice little patio with 2 chairs and a table outside the room. Nice clean room with iron and ironing board in the closet and also in room safe and small refrigerator. The property itself is full of green trees and flowers if you're into that sort of thing, which makes it seem very private. Lots of sun by the pool though and they also have a hot tub. Happy hour daily 5-7 and 300 feet to Duval Street. If your traveling from the Key West Express like we did, it is about a 10-12 block walk. We walked it and checked in early. Cabs and pedicabs (guys driving you in a cart) are available all around. Also, if you want to rent a scooter, 2,4, or 6 person electric car, there is a place across the street to do this. My wife and I rented a 2 person car, which goes about 27 miles per hour. $85 for 3 hours, $100 for 5. It's any easy way to see the island and surprisingly not as much traffic as I expected. I would highly recommend renting one of these to see the island. We did the 3 hour and it was plenty. Had lunch at Louie's Backyard by southern most point marker. Great views at this place. Also, don't forget about some of the bars by the harbor where the Key West Express takes you. We liked the Conch Republic and sitting up on the top floor at the Turtle Krawl. I would recommend staying in Key West 2 nights if you can pull it off. I wish we could have tried snorkeling. The water is so turquoise clear, If we went to Key West again, we would definetly stay at Almond Tree Inn.", "Date": "March 22, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Aalborg, Denmark", "Title": "\u201cExcellent ...\u201d", "Author": "LarsMorch", "ReviewID": "UR125785823", "Content": "Excellent service, Excellent room, Excellent location for couples.

We found the Almond Tree to be the ideal place for us meeting all of our needs. The location is just off of Duval street without experiencing the noise and traffic. One other thing about the location is that there is a laundry mat across the street. I know doing laundry is not high on the list of things to do while on vacation, but we packed light and about the fourth day, ran across the street, threw a load of clothes in and we were set for the remainder of the week. We also flew into Key West and did not rent a car, everything was in walking distance. Next door there is a pharmacy, a pizzeria and a sandwich shop if you want to lunch at the pool like we did. We found the Almond Tree to be very comfortable, clean and the staff attentive to all our needs. The morning breakfast covered a range of pastries, breads, bagels, juice, coffee, yogurt and fruit, just what we needed to start our day. In the afternoon there is a generous number of snacks for happy hour with coupons for two free drinks per person and if additional drinks are needed they are half price. The pool which is open 24 hours was very clean with the pool service coming on a regular basis to attend to the pool. The rooms are moderate in size, nothing flamboyant or fancy but clean. The landscaping is lush and attended to on a regular basis. We asked for a quiet room and stayed in room 110 which is on the first floor at the very end.

We got 2 rooms for 4 people (my parents and their two 21+ kids), and each room was very spacious: 2 big comfy beds, with a couch/coffeetable/kitchenette area too with minifridge and microwave. What I really liked most about it in all respects is how detail-oriented and on top of everything the family who owns it was. They've literally thought of everything, from basic amenities to how the space is laid out. It's a gorgeous - lush yet perfectly pruned - tropical property with a pool, hottub, fountain, and outdoor table area for the complimentary breakfasts and happy hours they offer (amazing). Excellent location: blocks from all the hot spots on duval (the inn is only one block off duval street, but you've got to walk several blocks to get to the really rowdy parts - or can walk about 5 blocks in the other direction to get to the beach). We walked around a lot the first 3 days then ended up renting scooters, which was a super fun and speedy way to explore the entire island. Tips: *Request 2nd floor rooms for maximum quiet (our rooms were generally quiet but we were across from the maids station so could hear early morning cleaning/laundry/banging noises sometimes) *Make use of happy hour and breakfast, but don't forget to try some of the local brunch spots (blue heaven) and local happy hour favorites (green parrot) too *TIP the staff :) - I can't believe how low the rates are for how hard this four-person family works around the clock so that we can relax. Very impressive. Cons (sort of not even..) *I guess if you are looking for a resort, or anything beach/waterfront, this wouldn't be your place. But in that case, Key West itself probably isn't your ideal location either. *If you have a particular reason you're coming (e.g. heavy partying you can stumble home from, or lots of boating) you could easily stay in a location closer to a particular neighborhood - but I still think the inn's location provided the best balance for a well-rounded mix of tourism activities *Breakfast/happy hour definitely get repetitive as are mostly the same every day so if you stay as long as us, mix it up and go out on the town!", "Date": "November 27, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Wrexham, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cSo good I did not want to leave\u201d", "Author": "Dianne6", "ReviewID": "UR120946441", "Content": "Arrived at hotel to a very friendly welcome and the parking was great too.

Good shower water pressure, an issue down there. Good fridge. Bad things: We stayed hard by the laundry room and some kind of large and noisy generator from the drugstore next door. This affects four rooms, I'd say, and you don't want them. Not an issue inside the room, they had doubled glass or something. A bright yellow light shined in the window all night and the slat shades didn't block all of it. The bathroom (toilet area) was really small and narrow, same for the shower (the sink and grooming area was in the room). Housekeeping tried to get in even though the do not disturb card was in the lock. When the lady saw I was not dressed, she still tried to get in, as in get your butt out of bed. Unpleasant.

Check in was smooth, the employees at the front desk offered assistance on activities on the island and provided us with a map to help get us started.

If you're looking for a luxury resort with a full sized bathroom then this isn't your place. The Almond Tree Inn is really the perfect blend of a B&B and a hotel. Just enough involvement from the staff to make you feel welcome with just enough privacy like a large resort would offer. The pool and hot tub were never crowded or noisy and the evening happy hour with treats and wine is a nice touch. We had breakfast a couple of mornings at the Inn and it was a sufficient spread of pastries, coffee, juices and french toast slices. All with that personal touch and warm staff that The Almond Tree Inn offers. I would have liked to have a few more hooks or racks for drying towels in the room. We slung our towels outside the room to dry and they got wet from whoever watered the plants. I think the inn should also offer additional beach towels in a stack by the pools. Each lounge was set up with a towel but it would have been nice to have more than one towel. That's just a personal thing with me. After 7 nights at the Almond Tree Inn, my only complaint is that I wanted an extra beach towel or two - I'd say this place is a WINNER! I am very hard to please.

Some rooms face the pool and patio and each has a private porch. Others are located in a separate two-story building with wide shuttered balconies overlooking the pool. Our room was divided into two areas- one with two queen beds, the other with a sitting area and kitchenette. The bath was a bit small, especially the shower stall, but everything was very clean and in good condition. The owners were friendly and available. We parked our car just steps away from our room for the reasonable price of $8 per day. Just across Truman Ave. from the Inn is a place that rents bikes, scooters, and electric cars- all handy for getting around in Key West, where parking spaces for cars are in short supply. Within two blocks are two great places to eat- the Blackfin Bistro and the wonderful La Te Da.", "Date": "May 11, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "NEW YORK", "Title": "\u201cPerfect Place\u201d", "Author": "JPGINGER19", "ReviewID": "UR104251728", "Content": "My Husband, Aunt, Uncle and I stayed at the Almond Tree Inn April 4, 2011 for one night.

But, having read the reviews I booked us four nights for late March, and the only regret I is that ended much too soon. As a relatively small hotel, guests are afforded the kind of personal service that can't possibly be delivered by the larger Hotels. Shay and Alex, were particularly attentive, knowing our names on Day 1. We normally skip breakfast except for one \"Blue Heaven\" day, but we made it a point to arise in the 9 o'clock hour each morning. We really liked the fact that the breakfast was available until 10, and we never felt rushed. The food, though limited, was of excellent quality, and just what we needed before we played tennis each morning, which brings us to the location. Twenty steps from Duval, a 6 minute bike ride to the Higgs Beach tennis courts, and a 1 minute walk to the drug store (we always forget to pack something), make the Almond Tree Inn the ideal location for us. Nestled on the center of the island southeast of disorder, I was expecting to hear some sleep-disturbing noise, but that didn't happen. The lush tropical grounds serve to quell the street noise and create an oasis of quiet easy island living- creating a yin to the yang of the Duval life we love, but in moderate doses. We made it a point to stay by the pool one afternoon, and we were both impressed by the staff's attention to detail. The sleep comfort was excellent, consistent with the reviews. The only small complaint was the bathroom was small and in need of remodeling- but this was easily overwhelmed by all that is right in the well-appointed room. The happy hours were enjoyable too- with good wine and conversation, as the staff serves you from a large kitchen window adjacent to both the pool and the front office, and there were always plenty of tables to accommodate. All told, the Almond Tree Inn exceeded our expectations, thanks in large part to the efforts of Shay and Alex. We told Shay as she alerted us that our taxi had arrived, \"we will see you in November.\"", "Date": "April 3, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Westfield, Massachusetts", "Title": "\u201cOasis in Key West :)\u201d", "Author": "havebabytravelwell", "ReviewID": "UR101543902", "Content": "Traveled to FL to visit parents in Bonita Springs, treated by parents to visit the Keys and travel together with my husband and 19 month old daughter.

I'm used to staying in Hilton Hotels and this by no means was a commercial chain hotel. We checked in with Alex who made us feel more than welcome with his above and beyond customer service. The pool and jacuzzi were small and a little shaded by a lot of palm trees, but the atmosphere was relaxing and quite beautiful. We enjoyed self-made margaritas outside until it was time for happy hour. The hotel offers complimentary happy hour from 5-7pm. It's a good deal to get your night started. They offer a variety of snacks such as cheese, pepperoni, crackers, chips, etc. and free drink coupons (2 per person per night). They also offer great deals (1/2 off already low prices) once you run out of coupons. The location is practically on the corner of Duval Street where all the action is and in a central location. We were close to both beaches (Fort Taylor which you pay to get in unless you have a military ID and Southernmost which you only pay if you want a chair). We would recommend exploring both of them as they each have their own advantages. We stayed at the Almond Tree Inn for a total of 3 nights. The bed was VERY comfortable and again staff made all the difference, especially Alex. Breakfast was nice to have each morning- bagels, pastries, hard boiled eggs, and an array of fruit. Also, coffee and juice to drink. Rooms were a little dated and shower was small, but everything worked perfectly and it quickly became our little home in Key West :) When we return to Key West, we will definitely stay here again.

The heat definitely takes it's toll on your energy level and your interest in walking to get to the area where you want to be -- and once you return to the hotel you are not too interested in walking all the way back later in the day.

My wife is fanatical about cleanliness and this passed her muster, we had a King suite and it was plenty large enough for the two of us. While the pool is small it is enclosed by a lush patio with plenty of seating for all. The Inn was always keeping the place clean and the landscaping trimmed. The complementary happy 2 hours from 5-7 each night was very special and above what I have found with the larger resorts. They served free beer and wine with all the sncks you could ask for, there was no limit and I did not see this being abused either. While we did not have a pet we did see guests with theirs and it was not a problem. There is a private outdoor parking lot and the location of the Inn is great to walk and see everything in Key West. Mallory Square is about a 1/2 hour walk if you do not stop in the stores, the Hemingway house is about 3 minutes and the Southernmost point is about 10 minutes walking. You are right off Duval street on the quieter end which is really convienent, the Conch Train just started a new stop right on the corner next to the Inn. That is perfect, don't worry there is no noise or crowds because of it. The Inn does not have a restaurant but does serve a great continental breakfast of bagels, toast, bolied eggs,muffins and all kinds of pastrys.

There's a nice happy hour for two hours every night and the free breakfast buffet of bagels and danish was very nice as well. The pool is open 24 hours and all they ask is that you keep the noise down, which is only fair to the other guests. The location is quite a walk from the Sloppy Joe's side of town, and it's centrally located and one block from Duval St.. There is a 24 hour CVS and Denny's within a block of the hotel and I liked that. All in all... as long as the service, quality and price remain the same, I will def stay at the Almond Tree again. Can't wait to go back again! P.S. Ask to stay in a room closest to the pool.

The rooms are a bit small, but cleverly set up and with all the amenities--ironing board, iron, hair dryer, etc. Our problems there were two-fold. First problem was that the place was packed with loud drunken folk who monopolized the pool and environs all afternoon, who were VERY profane. We aren't prudes, but this was just over the top! Some of these same folks had a two hour confab outside our room at 3 am and basically kept us awake until after 5 am. No management is around overnight, so we really had no recourse. (We learned later that we could have walked to the office and called a number posted there and someone would have been there 15 minutes later.) The second difficulty was the cleverly set up AND spotless rooms presented some functional problems. There was only one chair in the room. The very comfortable and pretty bed was way too close to the air conditioner. Essentially, the air blew two feet and then onto the person sleeping on that side. Me! In the end, we had to turn off the air, which was great until the room got too warm. I don't think I would stay there again for the above-stated reasons. Maybe someone younger who enjoys a few drinks would have a better appreciation for the clientele, and would be able to sleep with the air conditioner.

The room was tastefully decorated \"island style\", was very clean, and comfortable. The vanity area is separate from the bathroom and very spacious with complimentary \"Bath and Body \"products. The shower (no tub) was a bit on the cozy, small side. We had a private patio just outside our front door with a great seating area. The mattresses on the beds could be improved as they were a bit on the lower end of quality but, this was a minor issue for us. We thourghly enjoyed the waterfall pool, jacuzzi, and outdoor seating area that is very intimate in size and surrounded by lush, tropical foilage. The complimentary continental breakfast and \"Happy Hour\" was an added bonus. They offered yogurt, toast, fruit, bagels in the morning and can beer, wine and snacks for Happy Hour 5-7pm. The location is Perfect......Duval Street is practically at your door step and if you visit Key West this is where you will want to be. You can't beat this place. If you visit be sure to speak with Shae and Sean. They both work at the reception area and are incrediably accomodating to their guests.

The hot tub was wonderful and the room was great! Very nice furniture and soaps. The private veranda in front of our room was amazing and came in so handy for wet towels and bathing suits.

Most recently, May 26 - May 30, 2007. That alone should tell you that we like the place and we feel that it is a good value-accomodation for Key West! One of the most recent reviews (dated 5-30-07) talks about the \"terrible experience\" and mentions a frat-like atmosphere. This is the time period that we were there and yes, on Sat. 5/26 the pool area was crazy and unlike ANY other visit we've had to the Inn. A bacholerette party group was there and some other college-age students. It was crowded, rowdy, loud, etc. However, this cleared up by the next day. I'll admit the management did not seem to do much to remedy the situation on that day but the hotel worker was very young and I think he felt unable to control the situation. Again, by the next day and for the remainder of our stay, the Inn was a TOTALLY different atmosphere -- the same type of Inn that we have seen on all our previous visits. We have always observed a laid-back, relatively quiet pool area where friends, couples and a few families are swimming, getting tan, having drinks and just having fun. The pool area is very nice -- lots of tropical foliage, teak furniture (this was new since our last visit in 2005) and XM radio music piped in (a soft blend of rock/pop music). I totally disagree with a previous reviewer that said it was too loud! Not even. It was set at a pleasant volume where you could hear the music and lyrics above the normal, everyday noise from the hotel patrons, cars on street, etc. (By the way, the Inn seems very separated from the roads nearby by the tall fences and foliage.) I find the Inn staff to be very friendly and helpful. They will assist in any way they can. Calling cabs when needed, finding menus of nearby restaurants, etc. The breakfast and happy hours offered by the Inn are great. For breakfast, you get things like toast (all types - wheat, white, raisin), boiled eggs, fruit, coffee and cereal. For happy hour, they offer free beer and wine. All you want... you can continue to go back again and again and there are no funny looks if you have already had three or four or five... Every time we have been, the beer is basic -- Miller Lite, Bud Lite, Budweiser. But, this time, they had some Corona, Heinken, and other bottled beer. Not sure if this is normal -- maybe it was left over beer from rooms? Oh -- they also have munchies for the Happy Hour (chips, salsa, pretzels, pizza on one day, cheese, etc.). The rooms are decorated nicely. Tropical style. The beds are very comfortable -- comfy sheets, comforter, and lots of pillows. Robes are provided. An in-room safe. Bath & Body Work amenities! I see several people that complain about the bathrooms. I'll explain the layout -- the sink/vanity is in the same room as the bedroom. Big mirror provided. The toilet and shower in a separate area beside the main room and vanity. Is it small? Not in my opinion... how much room do you need for a shower and a toilet?? There is a toilet and it is separated from the shower by one of those pretty, glass cube walls. If you are really large person, the room may not be comfortable so just keep that in mind. There is no bath tub. Location is good unless you want to be super close to the BUSY area of Duval (near Sloppy Joe's and Mallory Square). This hotel is at corner of Duval and Truman. Walk 1/2 to 3/4 mile and you are at the BUSY area. I find it to be a good central area. You can walk easily to the beach (on east side), Lighthouse, Hemigingway's house, Blue Heaven, Green Parrott (oldest bar), main Duval area with Sloppy Joe's, etc. Don't hesitate to contact me if you have questions about the Inn or Key West!", "Date": "June 10, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "1", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Tampa, Florida", "Title": "\u201cOverrated; bad bathroom\u201d", "Author": "queen of belize", "ReviewID": "UR7722869", "Content": "Bad bathroom is what I most remember about this renovated old Florida motel. The new owners did nearly everything right in the extensive renovation except the bathrooms. The shower space is about 3x4. There is a silly glass block wall between the shower and toilet using up precious space. The toilet space is larger than the shower space. The same silly glass blocks are used for the window in the empty space in the sink area (why isn't this space better utilized?) and, worse yet, you can't block out the light at night. A useless blind drops down - though not quite the length of the window - but does nothing to filter the light that shines through all night long. I did not have a reservation to stay at this hotel, but stopped because of the vacancy sign. I had read the reviews before stopping here and was going off the reviews here. Bed was okay though mattress was showing wear. Rate was okay for off-season, but for the location and style of lodging, it was at the upper end. No wi-fi or high speed internet access in the room. There may be wi-fi at the office but I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m not going there in my jammies in the morning to crank up my laptop. Renovated lushly landscaped grounds are fabulous and so is staff. These guys know their business - give Americans free booze at night and free coffee and bagels in the morning and they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll go home happy and write nice reviews. Noisiness both from upstairs and next door. Trendy Tommy Bahama style-room furnishings but like most trendy stuff, showing wear and tear after only a few years. Daily continental breakfast is cordial and social; so is afternoon happy hour. Pool/hot tub as advertised. All these nice things and these people couldn't get the bathroom right? They should admit their error, suck up the cost, and renovate the bathrooms. I'm an animal fan so I was very comfortable with the ubiquitous roosters, hens, their chicks, and the cats, one of which liked sleeping in my private little alcove. Location is at Duval and US 1 so a very busy area. Really too far to make multiple daily treks to the heart of Old Town. Close to Hemingway's house, the lighthouse, Bahama Village, and upper Duval.

I worried for days about where to stay -- checking almost every tripadvisor review for every hotel on the island. At first I was disappointed becasue the \"best rated\" and most expensive hotels had a three night stay minimum and we were only going to be there for two. After reading the reviews for the Almond Tree (and knowing that the corner of Truman and Duval was a great location) I booked it. I made the right decision! You absolutely cannot beat the location of the Almond Tree. It is at the direct center of Duvall Street, so you are equidistant from the bar scene at the North End of the street and the the beach at the south end. The rooms are very nice, great robes, great sheets. Ask for Room 110, which is by the pool at the end of the hotel, it's as quiet as can be! The pool area is cozy, with music piped in and waterfalls running. The happy hour (free wine, beer and snacks) is the perfect time to have an afternoon swim and cocktails before going to dinner! And the hotel is located right accross the street from a great scooter rental place -- getting a scooter and buzzing around the island sightseeing is a MUST activity in Key West. Other recommendations include dinner at Martin's and at Louie's Backyard (tables and a bar area hidden away right on the water -- to DIE for). Both are upscale but \"Key West casual\", so if you're willing to spend a little more for a grat meal, both places are worth it. And you HAVE to have brunch at Blue Heaven. Outdoor seating, chickens running around, best eggs benedict we've ever had. In short, the Almond Tree is perfect for a fun, romantic getaway.

The happy hour was just in time. Wine, beer, snacks and the ever present friendly smile. The staff that we met - Trudy, Galina, Bruce and Bill the owner were so nice, helpful and full of good humor.

After searching through the reviews on Tripadvisor.com and actually other sites as well, we decided to cast our lot with this great place to stay in Key West. It is located right off of Duval Street on Truman. It was so convenient. We walked every where that we wanted to go. There is a Denney\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s right across the street, a Subway and a Papa John\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Pizza, as well as a CVS drugstore in a strip mall directly next door. Also, it is only about a 3-4 block walk to Camille\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s, or Blue Heaven restaurants. They are both great places to eat, and we enjoyed our meals very much. If you decide to rent a motorscooter or bike, you can do that right across the street, also. After planning this trip for several months, our arrival was scheduled on July 10th, which was right after Dennis had come through. We had been in Fort Lauderdale since the 8th, and called on Sunday to see if we could change our dates by one day. Carlos said that he would change our arrival date, and that we could actually check into the hotel any time that we got there, which was very good news to hear. Carlos, Jim and the rest of the staff pampered us and all the rest of the guests for our complete stay. Nothing we asked was to big a task for them to handle. A continental breakfast was served every morning from 8 to 10:30 AM and contained many pastries, cereal, bagels and the like as well as coffee and juice. In fact, the menu changed a little each day, which made it interesting wondering what we would have each morning. Also, a happy hour was there for anyone that wanted it every evening from 5 to 7 PM. Snacks of all kinds, and wine or beer was available. And as far as I could tell, they didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t care if you came back for the 2nd and 3rd beers or glasses or wine either. The rooms were excellent. We had a deluxe king bedroom and it was immaculate. Even furnished bathrobes. In fact, my wife liked the robes so much, she wound up buying two of them. The grounds were excellent. A beautiful fish pond was on the property containing many great looking fish. There was a nice small swimming pool, as well as a hot tub. And we were able to leave our car parked most of the time we were there, with the furnished parking lot. If you can find or if you know of a better place to spend your time and get as much for your money while in Key West, I would like to know about it. We don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t know when we might be going back to Key West, but when and if we do, The Almond Tree Inn is where we will be staying. I tried to download pictures with this review, but kept getting an error message when I hit send, so I can't help you there. Hope this review helps someone else make up their mind, because I know what I went through, trying to decide on a place to stay without ever visiting Key West.

The pool area, although on the small side, is beautifully hidden from the parking lot and street with foliage, gates, and a small fish pond/fountain. Almond Tree is conveniently located, yet far enough from the crazy Key West nite life that you can leave it behind when you've had your fill. Don't expect large spacious grounds, everything in Key West is tight. One note, no elevator so request a ground floor room if you don't want to carry your bags upstairs.
