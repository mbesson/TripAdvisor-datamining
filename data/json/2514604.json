On the hotel's website, for the nights I chose to stay, a king room and two doubles were the same price. After booking the room, I called the hotel to request a room with 2 beds and I was advised if a room with 2 double beds were available I would be able to get one. When I arrived to check in, a room with 2 doubles was available, however, I was informed there would be a $40.00 + tax upcharge despite the fact that the rack rate was the same for 2 doubles or one king. I advised the desk clerk that when I called no one told me there would be an upcharge. He told me that my request was in his notes, but there was still an upcharge. I ended up getting a roll away that after tax for 3 nights cost an extra $89.00. The 2 doubles upcharge would have been close to $150.00 extra. Aside from the hotel gouging me, it was clean but the free breakfast was substandard. The breakfast room is difficult to navigate because it is small and has these ridiculous oversized chairs. Because it is very small, the lobby is not much larger than a standard size hotel room and usually has one desk clerk working. Be prepared for a wait upon check in or if you need to store your luggage. The rooms are small even by NYC standards and the elevators were extremely slow. The location is good for business in the financial district and access to Battery Park, but is quite a subway or cab ride from midtown or other attractions.

Then, a co-worker, who made the reservation a few days before his stay, told me he got the cheaper rate.

It is a tall, narrow cube of a building, with 2 elevator shafts in the middle and only 5 rooms on each floor, therefore, the hallways are extremely quiet. Because of the positioning of the elevators, when you first enter the hotel, the front desk isn't immediately apparent. The staff is friendly but many of them are not effusive (I think some of this may be due to differences in language), but this is formally rated only 3 stars, so don't expect 5 star treatment. Personally, I give it an overall 4 star review. There is a 2 station computer room in the basement accessible by room key, which was clean and safe. There is a workout room with 3 large pieces of equipment nearby. Our room, #605 faced the courtyard which meant that our view consisted of the backs of 3 other buildings, however, this is one reason why I could actually sleep in NYC - no noise! The room was of European design meaning that it was extremely efficient in the use of space, and appeared to have been recently renovated. We had a king size bed with 2 generous end tables with 1 drawer and 1 shelf underneath of each. There was a medium size desk and chair in a slight alcove, and a medium size 4 drawer dresser next to a narrow closet. Much more room than was needed by 2 women for 5 days. The bathroom was fairly large but suffered the typical fate of only having one very, very small shelf for personal items. There was room for a full set of shelves or a set of drawers - they should update this. The only downside to the appearance was that during the renovation process they did not replace the bathroom tile, however it never appeared dirty, just a little worn. We got a rate of about $180/night before tax and when checking in asked if we could get 2 beds instead of the king. We were told that they would check and that it would be $25 per night extra. We kept the king and it was such a good bed that you never new anyone else was in there with you! The next day I overheard someone else ask the same question and they were told it would be an additional $45 per night for 2 beds, but the price difference may have been between a week night and a weekend rate. This was our first time staying in the financial district and it will be my first choice from now on. We spend most of our time in midtown and the travel back and forth couldn't have been easier. There were subway stops 2-3 blocks away and it was safe to walk after dark (at least until 10 or so, we weren't out later) as there was a strong police presence the whole way. There is a movement to grow this area residentially so there is a vested interest in making sure that it is safe. Avoid the new South Street Seaport tourist mall and stop at some of the small independent restaurants that are nearly empty on weekends, such as Ryan MaGuire's, what a meal!

However, when we arrived at the hotel, we were cheerfully told that they had one crib, but not two. And try telling one toddler that they are sleeping in the crib while the other sleeps with mom and dad \u2013 disaster. To avert just that scenario, we asked (begged!) the hotel to figure something out \u2013 was anyone checking out who was using one, could they borrow from a sister property, anything!

The room however, had that \"NEW REFRESHED\" feeling and was extremely clean including the carpet. I actually was not afraid to take off my flip flops to shower! The bed was comfortable and the temperature control maintained a comfortable temperature. They really maximized space in this hotel. The flat TV was wall mounted. There was a small chest of 4 drawers instead of a vanity. The desk and space saving chair was crammed in one corner and the bed in the other. There was even a small nightstand. The closet had a small shelf on top and was located behind the entrance door. We arrived at 11pm and woke at 7 so only spent 8 hrs sleeping so the room served its purpose. The bathroom in the room we stayed in was not that small but it was very poorly layed out. People have posted pics of the restrooms but ours was like the one posted labeled \" Room at Holiday Inn Express Wall St\" Take a look for yourselves. There are 2 different types. In our unfunctional bathroom the door opened up right onto the toilet. Also the counter was curved and since the toilet was located so close to the curve of the counter it was just very uncomfortable and we are not big people. All they have to do is move the toilet over a few inches towards the tub which is possible. Didn't anyone from the hotel or holiday inn express check out guest comfort??? There was an exercise room in the basement and a Business center as well with 2 computers and printer. But beware you can not download anything to the computer or upload photos to the computer as the security on the computer does not allow this. The really is no lobby in this hotel. Just a couch across the front desk and 2 chairs by the elevator. They lock the breakfast room after breakfast so you can't bring food back and eat it there. Check in was super fast and efficient. I called the hotel 2 days before arrival and they gave me accurate info. The nearest train station is \"WALL STREET\" on the 2/3 subway line. But there are many other lines if you walk an extra block or 2. I actually walked right past the hotel on Water street and called the hotel and they told me its right across the street from VERIZON which was true. All employees I talked to on the phone were patient. The young ladies in the breakfast area were nice and kept everything full. The maids were good as well. Each day they made the bed and replaced ALL tioletries. My room contained 2 bars of soap, shampoo, conditioner, mouthwash, shower cap, coffee, tea, decaff, decaff tea, cups, ice bucket w/ liners, towels, mats, washcloths. Ice machine was on the 17th floor. The only thing I noticed that this hotel did not have was 24hr coffee/tea in the lobby. Other HI expresses serve this but they did not. I know they have it in the room but sometimes you are just lazy and want to grab and run. We unfortunately had to leave on Sat. because the hotel really upped the room price on Saturday so we switched to Candlewood for the last 2 days. I couldn't understand why because the hotel was not at all that full while we were there. The neighborhood was fine. Safe to walk in after dark. No \"iffy\" characters walking around unlike the HI express on 39th st, that has a less than to be desired location. Would I go back.........OF COURSE if the price is right!!!

The hangers provided had clips for men's trousers, but the rod holding the hangers was too low and the trousers would drag on the bottom.

And, typically, the corridors were very tight. The rooms were serviced nicely - with towels and bedding changed regularly. My room faced Water Street and it was fairly quiet. There are plenty of good restaurants nearby. A Subway right next door and the Water Street Cafe (a deli and buffet) at the end of the block for budget-minded visitors and a number of more expensive restaurants within easy walking distance. Of course, there are food carts at the intersection of Wall and Water Streets that offer great food at low prices. The internet was free, fast and mostly stable. Two elevators handle all 20+ floors, but I never had a really long wait (only 4 or 5 rooms to a floor). They have free breakfast that includes eggs and bacon and suprisingly good coffee.

At both those other hotels i received decent service but kept mentioning to my Fiance that Holiday Inn would be way better. I am a platinum priority club member & I travel alot for work at always stay at Holiday Inn Express and Holiday Inn they always treat me very kindly and go out of their way to make me happy. This is NOT the case in this hotel. On cleanliness, price, and location alone the hotel would receive a 3 the hotel is clean but going through construction which instantly dirties your suitcases, the price is great and by using points they are one of the cheapest hotels in Manhattan, and the location is not very great unless your day revolves around wall street and the Brooklyn bridge. Now for the service it was terrible I am a platinum card holder (the highest level) for the hotel and I dont believe i should be waited on hand and foot but I do believe I deserve to be treated respectfully. Let me start by saying there is i ONLY 1 great employee there and that is the woman in the complimentary breakfast section she is very kind and friendly. Everyone else could not make the time to be bothered. When i arrived for check in the girl behind the desk waited a couple seconds to attend to me since she was on her facebook then I was given a decent room. I wouldn't bother asking for upgrades or paying for the most expensive room all the rooms are pretty much the same with an uninspired view. The room is very small and the bathroom is even smaller I would not recommend this hotel to families but only solo travelers or couples on a budget. Since I am a platinum member I received a free \"gift\" bag that was made up of a bunch of flyers from local businesses, 2 waters, and a bag of cookies. Don't break the bank! Versus at staybridge i received gourmet chocolates, a bottle of wine, and a handwritten thank you card. At hotel indigo i received a credit for my room mini bar and a room upgrade. My first of many problems occurred when I did not receive information about how to log onto the internet I called down and the phone rang for awhile so I hang up called back a little later. Then second time I called back Carlos picked up promptly and gave me the information on the internet code. After seeing a mistake on my bill while looking online ($110 dollars for using my free night for \"incidentals\" even though with no mini bar or room service I don't know how this would be achieved) I called down spoke to Carlos where I was told he could not help I would have to wait for the manager in the morning. In our conversation I was told too calm down and let him speak even though I hadn't even explained the situation and was only talking for 5 seconds. I think he just didn't want to deal with me. In the morning I went over to the front desk to speak to the manager who was in the \"back\" I said I would wait. The person at the front desk continuously asked me whats wrong so that she could tell the manager I kept saying I would wait but finally told her the situation and she went to the \"back\" to speak to the manager. Seconds later she came back and said \"Ok I'll take care of it\" no I'm sorry, no were sorry for the inconvenience of charging you $110 on your vacation, nothing! Not even a visit from the manager. Finally, I went back to the room and then down to the business center at around 10AM. I first turned on the computer and had wait for it to start up, then it asked for a password to log in to the desktop that only the employees had. Luckily there was a phone in the center so i called over the front desk and they said they would send someone over. I waited 10 minutes and no one showed on my way up I saw a maintenance person who helped me turn on another computer than didn't need a log in. I began using the computer and another person came into to use the computer I told them it didn't work and that they would have to speak to someone. They too called the front desk and no one came. As i finished up I passed by the front desk to see that the person waiting for the computer was trying to explain the situation to the front desk person who not only didn't understand the situation but offered to change rooms, hilarious! Finally, I checked out, left the luggage with the front desk who leaves there bags at the front desk hours before actually putting it anywhere. I went around the city and at about 1pm I called over to the hotel and said I need a cab to take me and my family to Newark airport they said I had to call back and they would get me a rate. I personally think it would be more professional to call me back but oh well. I talked to the front desk a little later and they said it would be 100 dollars, plus toll, plus tip to get to the airport, which is way too much. In a cab alone the fair would be 80-90 bucks max with tolls & tip! How do i know this? Because I found a cab and this is what they charged. In fact last time I left from staybridge suites and got a limo the charge was $75 + tip! I'm very disappointed in that I feel some type of backdoor deal was made to charge me extra. Lastly, while I was holding a few bags from shopping I got my luggage on my way to the taxi waiting outside an African American gentleman at the front desk assisted me with my bags he pulled them out of the closet put them in front of me and walked away! Come on! Help me out! I understand your not the \"bell boy\" but give some type of decent service I would've tipped you!

The front desk attendants were fine most of the time, but one of them was particularly rude. For example, we didn't have any shampoo in our room, went down to ask the front desk for shampoo, and she made us wait in the line of 10 people doing lengthy check outs even though she had the shampoo right in front of her.

The television was a wall-mount LCD with tons of cable channels including on-demand viewing. The free wi-fi worked as expected. The staff were friendly, but still seem to be adapting to their routines, as check in and check out seemed to take longer than usual, and our keys mysteriously stopped working one day and had to be replayed.

Plus, parking is at a nearby garage, with a discount, but that's pretty typical for a Wall Street area hotel.", "Date": "August 29, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Muskegon, Michigan", "Title": "\u201cvery clean...\u201d", "Author": "dave42499", "ReviewID": "UR77074718", "Content": "Nice room, very clean but really small, we had a king bed room, and it was small, the air conditioner works good, but its so close to the bed, it was cold. the breakfast is free and i was suprised, they have eggs bacon, sausage bagels, and never had to wait for a table, there also is a subway a few blocks away, and its walking distance to the south street seaport, all in all very happy with hotel.", "Date": "August 27, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "2", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "1", "Location": "3", "Rooms": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cI paid that much for a closet??\u201d", "Author": "Nace0206", "ReviewID": "UR76960054", "Content": "I usually stay in 4 star hotels when I travel to NYC, but this was a cheaper option so I decided to take my chances. Location was okay. I wasn't going to do any sightseeing, but if that's what you are traveling for, do not stay here. After checking in, I was literally put in a closet. The room was the size of the bed and the A/C unit was touching it. I could barely turn around in the bathroom. I called the front desk and asked to be moved to a handicapped accessible room, which was little bit larger than the first. At this point, it's 11:30 pm and I just wanted to lie down and relax when I realized my remote was missing and the tv wouldn't turn on without it. I called the front desk and he said he would look into it. 15 minutes later still no remote so I call him again and he says something about dealing with it later because he's busy helping someone else. So I just told him to forget about it. When I pulled back the comforter there were several sticky brown spots on the sheet. I was not about to wait for someone to change it so I ended up just putting the other sheet over it. The pillows smelled dirty and I woke up several times thinking about the sheets not being changed after the last person. The shower was weird. The elevator made awful noises that I hears all night.

I booked this hotel and I found it an enjoyable experience.. I travel often around both Canada and the US and would happily stay here again Room. First this is NYC.. so the rooms are small please do not judge them against hotels in other cities.. That said the room is new.. its all new.. there is not alot of storage area in the room but I made do with the small closet.. Everything was very clean and worked well including the TV with great cable.. The remote is a little annoying because you have to turn on both the tv and the cable but once you figure it out its fine.. (Need a sleep timer on it though).. The AC worked very well and although its rather loud keeps the room very cool. Gym... forget it.. Its very very small and unless you like just cardio a waste of time.. I got a week pass at the New York Sports Club one block away for 30 and worked out there.. Breakfast. It is free and is what you should expect.. the eggs I think are instant so I avoided them after the first day.. the juice is from concentrate but is fine.. I found the bananas past there prime but to be honest for a free breakfast it was fine.. Staff I found them all exceptionally helpful and pleasant.. always with a hello and smile on their faces.. Overall for the location I thought it was a great deal.. I would not book however directly from Holiday Inn. I booked through another site and got it at 2/3 the price they were quoting me..", "Date": "July 29, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "1.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Montr\u00e9al", "Title": "\u201cThey charged me 800$ for a reservation that THEY cancelled\u201d", "Author": "Mplove84", "ReviewID": "UR71645065", "Content": "Not only was the hotel not open for my stay and they advised me 3 days in advance, which is very helpfull in the high season, but I just received my credit card bill and they charged me $800.

The Guest relations helped me a lot trying to find a solution, but not all of them were nice with me. One of the lady made me feel responsible and told me there was nothing she could do for me... come on. Worst attitude and worst guest service ever in my life. Now, it is my 4th time calling Guest Relations, loosing my time again, trying to get my money back for a reservation they had cancelled and replace by another one, and I have NO feedback, neither from the hotel nor Guest relations.
