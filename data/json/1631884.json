I was travelling for work and Hop Inn had been recommended by an architect friend who had visited but not stayed in it. The booking was made on my behalf by someone else and proved to be the source of a great joke and prompted questions such as: have you seen where you are going? Do you know how cheap it is? Rumors abounded that I would be sharing a room with other people \u2026 The disbelief resulted from the seemingly absurdly cheap price. The reality was\u2026 a clean (albeit tiny) room, with en-suite (power shower), 24 hour air conditioning, free WiFi and a fabulous location. Hop Inn is also very easy to find arriving on the airport bus. The very friendly and helpful staff provided much appreciated advice/recommendations on places to eat/visit. Hop Inn, Hong Kong provides high quality service in a very compact package, it is an ideal base for exploring the city, and offers unbelievable value for money.", "Date": "September 7, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Singapore, Singapore", "Title": "\u201cGood value, fantastic location\u201d", "Author": "Kie C", "ReviewID": "UR138989385", "Content": "Tsim Tsa Tsui (TST), in my opinion, is the most convenient area to stay in Hong Kong and Hop Inn Hankow is less than 5 minutes walk from the MTR. Shopping, dining and attractions are within walking distance. TST MTR station is in a very centralised location that allows you to travel to different parts of Hong Kong easily. The 2 Hop Inn locations are within walking distance so no real difference which one you choose (location wise). I stayed in the Hankow one for 4 nights and on my very first night, walked to Carnavon Road (where the other Hop Inn is located) for supper and back. During my stay, I found the staff to be very friendly, rooms are small but clean. Wifi is available and they have laptop and tablets for lending, all this for free. There is a staff round the clock who will open the main door for you so if you need any help at any time, there is someone there. Maybe the only thing to highlight is that even though there are efforts to sound-insulate the doors, it can't be helped that you may get disturbed if another room have noisy kids or loud guests due to the close proximity of the rooms.

Our neigbours were was also not helping much as they came back late and make all sort of noises, talking loudly and playing music in the middle of the nights but no fault on the hostel then.

The entrance to the building is a bit shabby but there is a kind of doorman who monitors various security cameras.

They also have international travel adapters at a deposit of approximately HKD$10(if i rem correctly) and they will refund this $10 to you when you return. For those who have visited HK before, you should know that the room space is very small so this place is no exception as it can only be occupied by 2 people with 2 small opened hard-cased luggage.

Do take note that the main gate of this builing will closed around 11 or 12 plus so you need to press a bell at the left hand side of the gate if the security is not there (which they are MIA most of the time). Or maybe you can call Hop Inn number and the staff at level 6 will helped you to unlock the gate. Perhaps you can enquire the staff there about this late night gate thingy as i was not aware of this before i went there.

I travel to Hong Kong every year for about 2 weeks and stayed at different guest houses in Tsim Sha Tsui area, this was my first stay at Hop Inn. Like most reviewers said, the location is perfect, the room and bathroom, although small, is very clean and newly decorated. I got to talk to 3 different reception staff and they were all nice and professional and responsive to my request/enquiry. I had to switch room on day 3 because the wifi was not stable for my first room (need to reboot the router whenever I need to login). Had no problem with wifi after I changed room. I have one complaint and that's a big one for me.... the short supply of hot water in the shower. When the shower was on, hot water disappeared before I could even rinse the shampoo off my hair. They use \"storage\" water heater in which you turn on the water heater, wait for 15 minutes (the staff said) for the water to heat up in the storage unit and then you can take a shower. At first I thought it was an individual problem in my first room, but when I told the reception staff about it, I was surprised to hear that other guests complained about it and a technician was called to look at the problem (which he couldn't find a problem with the heating process). I am pretty sure it wasn't a malfunction of every unit, but rather the model they picked with a small size water tank that is the key problem. When I switched room, I chatted with a house keeping lady and she agreed it was a common problem. She is the cleaning lady that cleans every room so she should know! I don't want to write a bad review without any proof, and I was staying for 10 nights so I could do a little experiment. I brought my iPhone in the shower with me and used the stop watch to time how long the hot water would last. I also waited 15 mins, 30 mins, 1 hr, 2 hrs, half a day (just various duration) after I turned on the shower because I turned it on to see if that made any difference. The shortest time the hot water \"started\" getting cold was 52 seconds, and it turned completely cold within 30 seconds after that.... a total of 1 min 22 seconds of hot water. And no, I doubt if anyone can finish a shower within that time frame (washing hair or not). The average time when hot water started to get cold was in the 2-minute range, and usually by the 3rd minutes hot water would be completely gone. I ended up separating my shower and hair washing in two different occasions every day, and turned off the water altogether whenever I didn't need to rinse and only turned it back on when I rinsed. Luckily this May was exceptionally hot and I was able to tolerate this. I would like future reviewers to also contribute comments in this aspect and maybe when it is more than just me (and the reception staff, the cleaning lady, and two separate rooms used), the owner will acknowledge and tackle this problem. Oh one thing though, they advertise they use low flow shower head to be green, but that is not the problem... flow and water pressure has no problem...... just no hot water. I had stayed at other guest houses less nice and less cool and less clean.... but they had instant non-stop hot water supply. I have to honestly say I really really like Hop Inn, except for this problem. But if this problem is not solved.... I don't think I will go back and stay there (unless it's the peak of the summer)!", "Date": "May 30, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cGreat location!\u201d", "Author": "Christine C", "ReviewID": "UR130078644", "Content": "Stayed in Hop Inn Carnarvon for 5 nights in March 2012.

The very positive side is the location near Nathan Road and the MTR. The price of the room is not really a bargain at 690 HK$ ( i.e. 89 US$). There are other places in the area which are cheaper and at least similar if not better. 1. The room is very small, what you can expect when it goes about Hong Kong. But not only the room, the bed as well is too small: 120 cms for a double bed is definitely not comfortable. Furthermore, the furniture is limited to this small bed, one side table, a TV set ( without any english language news channel ) and 3 plastic hangers on the door...There is also a bathroom ( see my pictures) with a shower , sink and toilet bowl. All together, less than 10 square meters. Clean, yes. It is clean. SInce the Inn is located on the 9th level, don't expect however to get always water in the toilet flush....better to know it before experiencing it! 2. The building is currently in renovation, and is wrapped into a kind of fishing net sustained by bamboo scaffoldings. As a result, don't be surprised if you see workers right in front of your window while you are in the bed...don't forget to close the curtains.... 3. The access to the HOP INN is rather difficult to find : a dirty corridor between the Seven/Eleven and another shop. At the end, a lift for the 9th level. Not so easy to find the first time you come there. 4. The service : well, this is a \" bed without breakfast\"....don't expect anything else but a small place to sleep... 5. The management : I am a smoker. I don't book any room in any hotel claiming they get a non-smoking strict policy . That's why I carefully read the webpage of the Hop Inn before booking. No one mention about this issue. So I was quite surprised that I coun't find any ashtray in the room. Since we arrived very late ( about 11 pm) I decided to smoke one of my cigarillos and to water its end before throwing it in the garbage bin. The next evening at 11.20 PM, while we were already asleep, somebody knocked at the door ; I t was a \" manager\" who told me that the room maid found that I smoked in the room and that it was not allowed. I tried to tell him that I never requested a no smoking room and that I was ready to move to another room. He was becoming somehow rude and unpleasant : \" No way. You don't smoke in the room. You want to smoke, you go outside in the street. Is it well understood?\". I closed the door.... I can't accept such an attitude since there had not been any prior notice about smoking and since when I rent a room, I am the sole and only to decide how I use it for the time I rent it. The rude and impolite attitude of this managerial member of staff has been very shocking to me. So for us, this Hop Inn could be an average place to sleep ( and only that) provided that the management should acquire some educational skills.

Unfortunately, rooms were not available on our first night so I had to book a night with a nearby hotel along Pratt avenue which was just a few steps away. I almost missed the place while looking for it as the entrance to the building was small and you will only see the \"hop inn\" sign on the wall once you go inside the building.

The staff were warm and very accommodating, the place was clean, comfortable and very interesting.

The room and the bathroom are small but functional.

A cool \"common room\" with reading stuff, card and board games, and a football game which my son was very fond of. A door from the common room leads out to an open area \"roof deck\". They have a collection of DVD's which you can borrow, kettle for boiling water and power adaptors are also available. The location is very central and ideal as shopping, dining and interesting spots are all around. The MTR, bus station and the Star ferry are also near the place.

It was actually something that my friends and me found while surfing on the web for budget accommodations since hotel room rates in Hk is known to be expensive. Luv the location and place as everything from retail to dining outlets is at the door-step. Certainly delighted that there is a 7-11 just next to Hop Inn and Tsim Sha Tsui MTR station is just less than a minute walk away. Comparing to Yes Inn @ Fortress Hill which my friends and I stayed for 2 nights before we headed to Macau & Zhuhai, I definedly prefer Hop Inn as the rooms are newer and more centrally located. What was impressive is that they actually deck up the place with Christmas Ornaments since Christmas is round the corner. There is also a common room where you can play table-soccer game & books to borrow plus the roof top area to chill out. Like what my friends commented \u2026 the roof top area is exactly what we always see from TVB Dramas. Check-in was quick and easy and the place was easy to find. The staff showed us to our 4-bedder room which comes with a double-deck bed and a so-called double bed. I thought the double bed was a little too small to be shared with 2 person. Thus, was pleasantly glad when a friend pointed out that there was a pull-out bed under the double-deck bed. The staff also explained to us that each room has different wall drawings and d\u00e9cor and ours was apparently drawn by a 5 year old girl. Very impressive indeed. Toilet is very small though but manageable. Having always stayed at hotels whenever I travel, I find that Hop Inn was a very nice alternative and had made my stay a very comfortable one. Room is simple and had an artistic feel to it. The price is reasonable and not too heavy on the pocket. Perfect for a budget traveler like me. Hop Inn is highly recommended and I will definedly be staying there again during my next trip to HK.

The hotel fit the three requirements that we were looking for: 1) it was affordable 2) it was in a great location 3) it was safe! After finding about this place it seemed too good to be true. Tsim Sha Tsui is a very central location allowing access to 2 subway stations that are less than 5 mins walking distance. Getting to the harbor and the Harbour city mall is a 10 minute walk. Needless to say, it's a pretty central location. Tsim Sha Tsui is also party central at night for younger adults/teens so on the weekends there is activity going on well into the night. For the older crowds looking for some fun, heading into Central station, 3 stops away from Tsim Sha Tsui is a must. Just be aware that the subways close at 12 so taking a taxi back home will be necessary. The hotel itself is safe and clean though with no-frills. There is no clock, no tables, not even a spring mattress but me and my wife had no problems sleeping. One thing that will be harder to get used to are the washrooms. They are very small and Hong Kong style which means the toilet and the shower are in the same small space. When you shower, everything gets wet, sink toilet I mean everything! The decision to use clear glass as walls was also very peculiar though tree is a translucent shower curtain. Odd! The staff all speak English and are very helpful. Hair dryers are offered but you need to ask the front desk to use them. Plug adapters are also provided with a $10 refundable deposit. The biggest pain is waiting for the elevators. Though there are two of them, only one of them serves the odd numbered floors while the other services the even numbers. This means you only have one elevator to access the hotel and because it is on the top floor it takes forever. Overall though it's a no frills hotel I would not hesitate to stay there again as the place is an incredible value for what you get.", "Date": "November 28, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "1", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Leuven, Belgium", "Title": "\u201cCheap but really tiny rooms\u201d", "Author": "Marloud", "ReviewID": "UR121077226", "Content": "Lets start with the positive aspects. As said by most previous review, the hotel is located in the hearth of action and the staff is helpful, very friendly and speaks well english.

They contain just a bed, a tv and a small bathroom in which toilets and shower are put together. I booked first the single room which does not have any windows and in which I was barely fitting with my luggage. I spent an horrible night with the airco blowing directly on my face and on a matress hard as wood. Honestly, during my previous travels in Asia (Japan, Korea), I accommodated myself with small and no so comfortable rooms, but here it was too much (and I am a small guy, 1m68 tall). For the second night, I changed to the triple room in which, according to me, only two persons can fit. I slept a bit better, but still, there was a lot of noise from people in the hotel and these f...ing hard matresses! So, my conclusion is that you should not expect to be able to get a good rest at this hotel.

Although it's a hostel, the service is A+ I had a single room for 9 nights, the room is small, but convenient. I've read reviews about noisy rooms, but I didn't hear any noise. The best thing about Hop inn is the location! 7/11 around the corner, MTR and shoppingmalls (iSquare & Harbourcity). It takes about 10~15 minutes walking to see the HK skyline and lightshow at 08.00 pm. Another great thing is the free WIFI and the security. They have CCTV to keep an eye and they keep track of people who come in and leave the hostel. As a female travelling alone, safety is very important to me and this hostel is very safe.

We shared a smallish queen sized bed and my first impression was that the bed was too hard for my liking, but dismissed it cos I've slept on a wooden floor before so this should be alright. But I couldn't sleep because the mattress was slanting on one side. The whole night felt like I was sleeping on a slope. Eventually I fell asleep when the sun was about to rise. Later, I woke up to find usual bumps on my arm and thigh. My sister had what seemed like a mosquito bite on her thigh too although we didn't notice a mosquito in the room throughout our entire stay. So every night my sister and I scratched ourselves, thinking that maybe we can't sleep cos of the slanted bed but then I checked the raised blister-like bumps on my arm to realize that we were bitten by bed mites. I had a bite on my cheek too unfortunately. One of their late-night staff wasn't very helpful or friendly too (didn't catch his name but he had long hair). When my sister requested for another blanket, he told her to wait 10 minutes for him to look for the cover for the blanket and then to stuff it in. He said it's hard to reach. She returned more than 10 minutes later only to find him behind the counter on Facebook. She asked for the blanket and was greeted in an irritated manner, as though she was intruding into his Facebook time. Sighing and fumbling with his words\u2014and reluctantly\u2014 he said he forgot and has to grab a chair to reach it cos it was stored too high up. In the end, he grudgingly gave her a piece of blanket that didn't require a cover and went back to face his computer. Apart from that one rude staff, the rest were polite, helpful and friendly.

Needless to say, the rooms aren't gigantic but nice, clean and cosy. I'm a complete sucker for well-designed rooms! With \"strategic positioning\" you can fit 3 medium-sized luggage on the floor and still walk about freely. Though the twin bunkbed (Altostratus) room appears to be small, luggages can be tucked under the bed, creating more room. Both the rooms' toilets were clean. BUT you might be disturbed by the room next door when they shower in the wee hours of the morning, IF you are a light sleeper. Oh the noise coming from the heater or shower head :( +ve: FREE WIFI - extremely useful, helps me save on data roaming charges / can borrow laptop from the reception FEEDBACK TO HOP INN: It'd be good if you all add more hooks around the room/toilet. Since the only ones available are those attached to the door - too close together, we had to find means and ways to hang/air our damp towels after showering. What else do I like about Hop Inn? (1) Location: Only about 5 minutes away from the train station, and away from the hustle and bustle you find along the busy streets. That means you'll get a good night's rest. Nearby you can find shops that sell nice, cheap clothes and goodies from Macau too! BUT if you're new to HK like I was, when you alight from the airport bus, you may have to ask around for directions. I recommend somebody from a shop, not a random stranger along the streets since I witnessed touting going on (around 10, 11+ at night). (2) Safety: There'll always be a staff seated at the reception, next to the main door so...can we safely say it's hard for strangers to intrude? They will check which room you're staying in. Also, the door is always locked with a password - so the only way to access from outside is by buzzing the doorbell and wait for the hostel staff to attend to you. (3) Service: Almost everyday, it's a new face. Service is fairly consistent, and good.

This is not the owner fault, as they welcome us very well, and I didn't have problem with the policy or so on. The problem begin when we found out the bunk bed room is way too small for us. My wife is pregnant and my weight is almost 90kg, so I'm afraid I will wreck their bed if I sleep on the top of the bed. On the first night after several hours trying so hard to sleep, I come to the receptionist and found the most snobish person I've ever met. I've asked about whether we can move to the triple room, because that night around 2 AM nobody is coming. The reception a middle aged man, with long hair, and Tshirt, said that somebody is coming. And when my wife asked him again (around 3 AM) he's shouted angrily and said that he was very busy ( I look at his PC & I thought he was busy facebooking). My wife said, it's only because we couldn't sleep that's she has to asked for the second time, there's no need to be rude. I know it's not their fault, but it's not like I'm doing that in purpose either. The next morning we move to Hankow Hotel, just a few step from the Hostel and decided to move. The Hostel owner offer to sell our room to another person that might come by, and at the end of our 4 nights stay, only one person come and rent our bunk bed (she move on the next morning too). We've paid 5500 HKD and lost around 4000 HKD (I've rent one bunk bed & one triple room for 4 night) . This is not about the money, because I understand their policy and I respect it.

(from the airport get off the bus stop it says on the website, walk down peking street opposite the mansions, then the road the hostel is on is the road betwwen the addidas shop and fortress) The journey is very easy and is a 5 min walk with heavy backpacks... 2 mins without!! The hostel is also a 3 min walk to the metro station. Buy an octapus card from the aiport! It is great value and the transport systems are sooo easy to use!

There was a double bed (which is a little hard, but after a long day sight seeing you are so tired you just fall to sleep anyway!)

I don't know what he was doing in there. I got no sleep. When I went to find out what was going on, the guy at the desk said that he could hear nothing. I kept going back and saying it was noisy and he kept denying it. Eventually I rushed out of my room once while it was happening and dragged him in and he finally admitted that it was noisy, and said it was the plumbing. He said it was always like that. I lasted one night and then checked out, even though I had originally booked 4. I had to pay for all 4 up front, and they refused to refund my money. They did say that they would refund the money if they managed to fill the room, and gave me one night's money back. And then claimed that they could not fill the last 2 nights which I was not convinced by. I thought the price was good, and the location was great. The art in the rooms is nice and the desk people were friendly and helpful. It's a good concept. But I got no sleep and it drove me nuts. And I was not impressed by the denial of a problem.", "Date": "December 10, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "makati", "Title": "\u201cGreat find!\u201d", "Author": "jmemd", "ReviewID": "UR89306914", "Content": "Stayed for 4 days and 3 nights with my husband... glad we decided to book this place.

Entering the hallway gave me a little uncomfortable feeling as it is very small and worn out with old desk, security camera, water pipes and airducts... Not a very good first impression at all. Heading up second floor via the elevator, we can easily spot Hop Inn sign. We rang the bell and entered another tiny hotel loby. Wilson greeted us and gave us a speedy check in at 11:30AM. Had to fully paid for all 3 nights in advance though. We had room #4 for triple. This room also gave me an uneasy feeling with old fixtures, airducts, pipes and a window that could not be tightly shut which took in the cooking odor from the downstairs restaurant. What I like about Hop Inn is the location, services, free wifi, free water. I dont like the hard bed (I felt like sleeping on a box spring), the cooking odor, the noises that we could hear from outside street as well as our neighbor in room #2, the slamming door sounds... through out the night. The bathroom style with shower/toilet/sink combination is not my favorite either. I also dont like the toilet floor with some dark moldy spots and the cimented hallway that looks like we are in a haunted hotel. Bottom line is: I would not want to come back to Hop Inn (even for HKD650/nite ~85USD) and I would definitely not recommend my friends and family to come here.

On the downside, the rooms are small! We stayed in the double room and the bed is actually a 1.5 double bed rather than a true double. There was only enough space to open our suitcase on the floor and that's about it really. We also moved to a triple room, and there was more room to swing a cat, and place our suitcase but if three people stayed there it would be a squeeze with the luggage. However, we just used the hostel as a place to sleep rather than a place to hang out (if so then I'd find another place to stay...but it is just a hostel and not a luxury hotel). As such it was perfect for us. There is no lounge room to sit and meet other travellers, but there's a nice little cafe next door on the same floor called the Peace cafe.

The staff all speak excellent English and could not be more helpful. The location could not be bettered - a five minute walk from the metro , Nathan Road and the Star Ferry. Free Wi-Fi in rooms.

We also stayed in room 9, with a bunk bed. This was very small for two and it was difficult to sleep as any movement on the top bunk shook the lower bunk. The bathroom was also smaller than some of the other room, such as room 2, which had a slightly larger bathroom, but a very small double bed - we ended up top to tailing.

I recommend this inn for your next short stay in Hong Kong.", "Date": "March 23, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Philippines", "Title": "\u201cWould definitely stay here again\u201d", "Author": "NomadTripping", "ReviewID": "UR58943514", "Content": "When I saw the website of Hop Inn, what made me decide to book my stay here is the room design and the reviews. I was not disappointed. My stay in Hop Inn was great. The staff was very friendly and accommodating. The room was spacious enough. The bathroom was a bit small but that was fine. I traveled with 2 friends and their kid, but they stayed in another hotel. Their kid however preferred to stay in my room. I guess because of the design of the room and because my room was more spacious. She could play around and climb up and down the bed. Clean towels were provided and the room was cleaned every day. Another thing I appreciated is you can borrow a laptop from them and this comes without charge. The location was great. It was very accessible since it\u2019s near the TST MTR Station and since it\u2019s in TST you have the shopping district around you and you\u2019re just a few blocks away from the Avenue of Stars, The Clock Tower and Harbour City where you can watch the Symphony of Lights.", "Date": "March 18, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Rooms": "5", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Sonthofen", "Title": "\u201cThis place is highly recommended.

I had a smooth transaction with them via email and skype IM. Their booking procedure is straight forward. They spoke very good English so booking was not a problem and they entertained our questions about payment procedure and options. The rooms are very clean and is just perfect for a traveler. We got the one big bed and one twin bed and is just right for us (me and my friend). The bathroom is cute and clean. It had glass panels but you have a shower curtain that you can just pull when you are using the bathroom. It is accessible to local eateries, restaurants. In fact there is one right next to the Hanyee Building where Hop Inn is and a couple more along the street. The Wellcome supermarket is only a few steps ayway. The MTR is about 2 minutes walk.

Hop Inn sits right in the middle. Not a hotel as such, but a really nice shiny new upmarket hostel is a good description. Check out their website, the pictures don't lie. Rooms are, as is expected in HK, small, but they're well designed, and there is definitely enough room for a stay of a few days. Beds are comfy, showers are hot, sheets and towels are clean (well, everything is clean). Staff are great, can speak really good English, and are very helpful. The location is great too, right in the middle of places to eat, drink and shop, and only a couple of minutes walk to Nathan Road and the nearest MTR station. Considering the location, the room was really quiet at night, so was able to get a great night's sleep. In total we stayed 4 nights, and were very happy. Would definitely stay here again in the future. Slightly difficult to find, but is accessible from a *small doorway* directly opposite HMV on Hankow Road. Look in the doorway, look for a *small* sign on the wall just inside the doorway... Take the stairs/lift to the 2nd floor and you're there. I've only given it 4/5 for value... but that's just because I hate spending money :-)", "Date": "February 5, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Ft.

Simon and Wilson are incredible hosts who directed us to many great tourist destinations and restaurants. Definitely try Spring Deer for their Peking Duck.
