However, when we arrived at the hotel I was overwhelmed with the smell of body odour - and I mean really overwhelmed. The decor was very shabby and the place just looked extremely rundown. I went to check in and the man wouldn't take my credit card but asked for cash so I said I'd have to walk to a cashpoint in the snow. He did give me a brolly which was nice. However, he didn't seem happy about letting me leave without paying and suddenly the credit card machine started working. I was so tired I forgot my PIN and he said 'well how were you going to take money out the cash machine then?' This was a valid question but it was said in an accusatory way. I explained I'd have used my debit card to which he said I could use it at the hotel. Basically the whole rundown look of the place made me nervous entering my PIN for my bank account whereas at least with a creditcard if you get cleared out it's easier to get the money back. Anyway I paid and the man opens a door leading down to a seedy looking, damp smelling basement and told us our rooms were down there. I actually felt quite scared and was worried about being kicked down there and locked in! A Japanese couple who were also checking in got quite upset and the women said she wouldn't go down so they left. Our room was horrible. The bed had massive springs poking out, there was no heating/radiator on despite it being below zero outside, it smelt of damp, the electric socket looked unsafe as it wasn't completely covered, there was one thin sheet and a stained blanket for warmth, the walls were thin and we could hear talking throughout the night. I could go on! I don't normally moan about hotels as I've stayed in basic ones in lots of different countries but this hotel was beyond basic. There was no excuse for how horrible it was and at \u00a360 a night I'd have rather paid an extra \u00a320 and stayed somewhere better. It's funny that the worst hotel I have ever stayed in happens to be in my own country. Needless to say my husband and I didn't sleep well at all as we were huddled for warmth and we left at 6am just to get out of there. I have photos to upload but I'm at work at the moment so am unable to. If you do want to see them you can message me and I'll be more than happy to show you or I'll try to upload them on here.

The sheets were also marked slightly. Upon opening the wardrobe we found a brown fleece blanket and a duvet that had no duvet cover on it, was soiled and had rips along it. Upon moving the bed as we wanted the double and single together we also found a dirty sock and an extremely disgusting pair of soiled and bloodied underpants which i find is quite appalling considering the rooms looked cleaned but obviously the staff don't check under the furniture or wash the sheets appropriately. Sleeping was very cold too as they hadn't provided enough duvets for the double and the single bed. Their were towels provided but from the state of the beds we decided to use our own. We stayed their for 3 nights although we weren't sleeping their the first night as we were stopping in a hostel in Brighton (which was 100% more recommendable than this hotel!) and not once were the bed sheets changed however we did find a 4 pack of loo rolls had been placed on top of one of our suitcases even though we didn't have a toilet in our room. The shower was broken thus we used one further along and they had all the windows open which made it extremely cold and we couldn't close them as they were so high up!!!! very filthy hotel i would not ever recommend this hotel, if you want to stay in central london for a similar price i would choose the Gresham, which is still budget value but is clean and gives you new bed sheets and towels everyday!!!", "Date": "February 5, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Sleep Quality": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "King's Lynn, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cHow is this place still open?\u201d", "Author": "Andrew F", "ReviewID": "UR121631756", "Content": "We arrived at the Lonsdale to find another customer busily filling in a complaint form, he said to us ''I'd turn around and leave if I were you'', or words to that effect, and I have to admit that he did have a point.

We were given the key to room 26, which was next to room 33 bizarrely enough, and made it very difficult to find. On entering the room we were struck by the sweltering heat, the lack of any bed linen and the general scruffiness of the room itself, which had a dirty carpet (like the rest of the place). While trying to find the room we were struck by the poor state of repair of the hotel in general, and the grimy feel of the place, not to mention the uneven floors and a the general lack of any Fire safety, if that place catches light it would be very difficult to get out. The lady on reception was actually fairly helpful, obviously well practiced in the art of fielding complaints/ dealing with refunds. She even offered to provide a free taxi to another Hotel which we declined as it was probably of a similar standard to the Lonsdale!

Cons: Very poor service, rude staff, dirty & dusty, old & decrepit, no security. We arrived at check-in time (3:00 pm) and were provided with our room key. Climbed the stairs (no elevator) to the 3rd floor, used towels, used bed sheets, even buckets with cleaning products strewn throughout the corridors creating many obstacles / trip hazards / hazardous substances particularly for children. This was the same on all floors... Arrived at our room to find the door already wide open with a used towel being used as a door wedge. Suffice it to say, the room wasn't ready for us. Cracked walls, chipped paint, worn out smelly old carpet. The state of the room, and the mess in the corridors gave the impression that the cleaner(s?) had suddenly stopped what they were doing and ran off in an emergency! There was no one around at all, so had to return to reception to complain. Was fed a load of rubbish and excuses, and had to demand another room. Cancellation was not an option as we were refused a refund. Our new room was ready this time, but the general condition was the same. The whole place is very OLD and is in desperate need of refurbishment. The cleaners only make the beds with fresh sheets which are clean, and provide fresh towels which are also clean (the Lonsdale's only positive note). The cleaners do nothing more it seems, as the whole place is caked with dust and is quite drab. The showers are dirty and mouldy, a warning for allergy sufferers such as myself. Receptionists hand over the keys to ANY room, no questions asked. Went in and asked for the keys to three separate rooms at once (for family members not present) and they were quickly provided with nothing said. The front door to the street is ALWAYS kept ajar, despite a sign on the outside asking for guests to ring the bell to gain entry. The shared toilet for the non en-suite rooms on our floor was not resupplied with toilet paper and ran out. My wife advised the receptionist who had the cheek to hand a roll to her expecting HER to re-stock the toilet herself!!! My wife explained that we were actually just going out, and when we returned later that afternoon, the toilet paper had still not been replenished. Again, my wife advised the two lazy receptionists, one of whom said \"Oh yes, this is the lady who wanted the toilet paper\". My wife responded \"No! I told you that the first floor wants more toilet paper, and YOU can take it up\". Still, the receptionists tried to hand the roll over to us. Still no paper in the toilets the following morning... The images of the hotel give a false impression in my opinion. The images of the rooms look much nicer than what we saw during our stay.

We didn't realise at the time we were going away on the weekend of the London Marathon. Arrived at the hotel at approx 3pm. On arrival we found out that the rooms we had requested wern't available and had actually lost one of the rooms we requested. We asked could we see a room and were told we couldn't as the rooms weren't ready (even though check out is down as 10AM!) We finally agreed on rooms as we worked out we could make do without one of them. The hotel staff, who were rude and generally unhelpful (didn't even have managers contact details to give us), told us to come back half an hour later and the rooms would be ready. Asked about leaving our bags there and were told just to set them on the floor. They was no where secure to put them. On arrival back at the hotel we were informed that wehad been given another room, even though we had agreed to change this before. Therefore we ended up paying for a room we actually didn't need. One room was blocked with towels preventing people getting into it. The en-suites are tiny (look like a built in wardrobe). Window's wouldn't stay open and as the heating was on all day you were returning to an uncomfortable room. No proper blankets for the bed. Only one thin pillow per bed, you may as well be lying with your head on the mattress. Locks looked as if they had been broke. Main staircase was also the emergency exit which was blocked most of the time with towels etc. Water stains down the ceiling and walls. Key is supposed to be handed in every time you leave the hotel (we chose not to do this) and on arrival back at times there was no member of staff there that you could have got your key back from.

We weren't expecting a five star hotel for the price but we were at least expecting the rooms we had booked! I received a phone call from the hotel around an hour and a half before we were able to check in at 1500. They were just confirming the number of rooms and type that we had booked. They never mentioned that there might be problems ahead for us. We headed for the hotel early to try and leave our baggage in before check in time. When we arrived they confirmed that we would have to wait until 1500 to check in. This was fine as that is what we expected. But then I was told that a single ensuite I had booked was no longer available so it would be a single basic (with shared bathroom facilities). This wasn't ideal but we convinced ourselves it would be okay. Then we were told that we would be in 2 family rooms, the single room, and a triple ensuite. - 4 rooms in total not the five I had booked (2 x twin ensuites, 1 single ensuite, 1 double ensuite and a triple basic) This essentially meant that people who should have had there own room would have to share with friends. After a considerable amount of arguing we worked out that the price would now be less since we didn't have all the rooms we had booked. But then we were told we would not be able to check in until after 1700 rather than 1500. That in itself was unacceptable as we had to be leaving the so called 'hotel' after 1600 to get back into town. Then the time miraculously came down to 1530 when we could check in. I also asked for a discount for the lack of an ensuite with the single room now to be told \u00c2\u00a35.00 a night is all they could throw off the price - a grand total of \u00c2\u00a310.00 of a reduction - wow very generous of them! I also asked to speak with a manager to be told he had already been that morning and probably wouldn't be back at the hotel over the weekend. On asking if they could not phone or contact them the receptionist said they did not have contact details for him (which I believe was a blatant lie). We also asked to see a room but were told we could not because they were being cleaned. We headed to a local pub to wait on check in and grab some food after being told they would phone us. No call came. We returned to the 'hotel' at approx 1550. We could now check in but the price had returned to normal as they had moved a guest to another hotel and gave us an extra room that we didn't have the people to fill! We ended up paying for a room that was empty all weekend. The young man at reception said that now we got what we wanted 5 rooms again. After thinking and accepted that we would have to share for a cheaper price this only infuriated us again. It was an absolute disgrace. Unfortunately for us we were stuck. Having flown into England only hours before and knowing hotels in the area and London generally were already fully booked we had no option but to reluctantly pay for the rooms they were giving us. It is amazing that they didn't keep the rooms we booked online free rather than having to move us to a rooms we didn't want nor book. Using an excuse that one room had been flooded. That doesn't explain us getting none of the rooms we booked. The rooms themselves were basic to say the least. Falling apart - damp on the walls, window frames rotten - a light missing it's fluorescent tube but no measures taken to make it look at all safe. Nails protruding from the wall. Basically sheets as covers for the beds. Not even a wardrobe. When they made out our receipt they had listed on it the original rooms that we had booked not the replacements they had forced upon us. It therefore seems as though we payed for the rooms we wanted which is not the case. I honestly don't think the staff cared at all about our situation. As long as they were taking our money. This place should be closed down - how it has ever managed to pass any inspection is a mystery to me. Really put our trip to London off to a bad start. Would never go back there again.

Unfortunately, I didn't stand my ground, figuring I could always get my money back if it was to awful. DO NOT DO THIS - THEY WILL NOT GIVE A REFUND. 4) As we walked up to the room up the filthy, and I mean FILTHY, carpets the smell of damp increased our foreboding. Mess lay around, cupboard doors standing open etc. Surely the room must be an improvement, we prayed... 5) We were in London for a Valentines weekend, but were given a twin room, having booked a double. First night ruined as they couldn't move us until the next day. 6) Carpet unbelievably dirty. 7) Hot water didn't work propelry. 8) TV remote had no batteries in. 9) Light was broken. 10) Blankets were clean but of really crap quality. 11) Toilet seat was broken off. 12) Furniture looked like it was from a jumble sale, mismatched, cheap and ancient. 13) I refused to eat the breakfast - if a hotel cares this little for the cleanliness of its rooms, what is the kitchen and food going to be like... 14) Asked for my money back the next morning, they refused, I left anyway.

A buffet breakfast is included, you can choose from basic items in an English breakfast - sausage, bacon, eggs, tomato with toast - or there's cornflakes and fruit available. Breakfast is served with tea, coffee or orange juice. The room is QUIET, which is a real blessing, and there's a heater which means you control the temperature of the room. True, the windows don't have locks on, but all rooms are on the first floor and upward, and they're the old fashioned 'lift up' windows which are nigh-on-impossible to get into from the outside and the doors have inside deadlocks.
