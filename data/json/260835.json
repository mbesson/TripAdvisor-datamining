The bath was clean but in need of an upgrade/renovation. I found the staff helpful and friendly.

Nice hotel right off the k'dam. You do have to walk up two flights of stairs to get to the reception area. We had a room with a little balcony and could see the k'dam from it. It was very warm that weekend and they have no airco. We had to go to Saturn to buy a stand up fan for 10.00 EUR so we could bear the hot room at night. Breakfast was basic, breads, cheeses, meats and hard boiled eggs. All in all, I would stay here again, maybe not when it is so hot out. Good value for hotel right off k'dam.
