{"Reviews": [{"Content": "Great Location Great location which is just across the road from North exit of Ikebukuro station. The staff are very helpful and room size is just right. Convenience stores, eateries and lots of interesting shops just around the corner. To book directly through the hotel website, you will need to enroll as a member first. However, there is only Japanese version for its website . I would highly recommend this hotel and would definitely stay there again for my next trip to Tokyo.", "Date": "Dec 19, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR907943079", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "ruemonge"}], "HotelInfo": {"HotelURL": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1066460-d1095043-r22842743-Hotel_Sun_City_Ikebukuro-Toshima_Tokyo_Tokyo_Prefecture_Kanto.html", "HotelID": "1095043", "Price": "Unkonwn"}}
