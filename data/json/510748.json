The not so good: style and design (actually very weird design ideas) on a budget means that it looks good on the surface but scratch away a bit and it's tired and in some places a bit grubby. For example, the shower head does not have self cleaning heads and is semi-permanently fixed to the pipe so does not get cleaned: result, blocked nozzles and a dribble of a shower. The bad: well, here's my mail to Radisson. I am waiting for a reply: \"I've stayed in 3 Radisson Blu hotels in the last 2 months. This one really disappointed. For EUR 175 I do not expect to be woken up at 4.30am to find that my window (poor sound insulation) is no more than 50m from two levels of the train tracks into the nearby main station. Train noises, tooting horns and loudspeaker announcements kept me awake the rest of the night. I commented to reception at check out, who said that the hotel was full which is why I had been given that room, then said that i should have asked to be changed room - at 4.30 in the morning?? Which also begs the question how to change room if the hotel is full? I was offered no further apology nor offered any compensation nor invited to speak to someone senior. Poor value and poor service. Whatever happened to the Carlsson 100% satisfaction guarantee? I await your comments.\" 5 star this is not!! Stay here only if guaranteed an inside facing room.

The facilities weren't at all bad and we enjoyed sitting by the rooftop pool drinking tea or beer. But the base design was flawed - I think the designer tried to serve up basic and low quality as minimalist. Melamine covered chipboard for the door surrounds oozes low quality. Reminiscent of the white-sprayed Formule 1 rooms but with ensuite. Fittings were loose and unrepaired. Bath surround worn, bath ceiling starting to show signs of mould. But for a four day stay it was tolerable and proved a good base, with easy city and airport access. Think 2/3 star with upgraded facilities.

To be honest the woman at reception seemed to expect us to complain about the room. We were told we would be given a free upgrade to a junior-suite but that it would take several hours (no problem it was early afternoon). I believe we were actually upgraded to a queen-suite (3rd floor). This room was much larger with a wooden floor, an exercise bike, jacuzzi,,, sounds great. Except for the fact that once again most of the fittings were loose, lightbulbs not working, the electrical devices seemed temperamental (for example the electronics lowering the blinds, which was essential for any privacy in the shower/bath area. Quick notes on other things: Ignore my ratings on Spa/breakfast as we didn't use these. Both rooms we were given were air conditioned. We slept well in the hotel. The hotel location is very good, right next to the main train station. This hotel could be so much better if they maintained the rooms to a reasonable standard.

But the location of the hotel is so convenient! It didn't take long to navigate the neighborhood well, and they're really close to the major sites like the Colosseum and Trevi Fountain.

We were visiting Rome for only 2 days for the Rome Marathon. The hotel was very convenient so that is why we chose the Radisson. I called ahead to as for a roll away bed for the room as our daughter was joining us for the weekend. First of all let me explain that our booking was done through the Radisson Reward centre. When I called the hotel, the clerk said that we didin't have a reservation. After persisting he finally found it spelled incorrectly. I thought that the clerk understood about the extra bed and was happy everything was in place. When we arrived, we had the clerk I had spoken to so I thought everything was going smoothly until he informed me that they could put a crib in the room but not a bed (our daughter is 23) he hummed had hawed and finally said we would have to get a different room. Okay, so move us to a room that could accomodate the extra bed or put us in one with 2 doubles. I said okay to the change and he needed to reswipe our credit card for the upgrade. He took the credit card and tried to put it through then announced to the world that the card was declined. (he had forgotten to let us put our pin number in. After straightening out the card issue he handed us 1 key card, in my confusion I asked for 2 and he told me I already had two for the other room. Oh no.....we needed to get a seperate room for our daughter. The rooms are the craziest rooms I have ever seen. In the middle of the room was a platform with the bed facing the window and also on the platform was a shower only large enough to clean a bean pole. the wash basin was right behind the headboard on the left of the platform and a hanging rack on the right. The bathroom had its own enclosure but the trick was to find the lighting. Eventually we found it on the outside of a random door. hslf the light fixtures didn't work and neither did the blackout curtain. We had a light that had a large sac over it and when you turned it on the sac filled with air to this big balloon. The hallways and the rooms were well used and required much updating.

Having stayed here for 5 nights over Christmas, I think the hotel location is average although being located next to the termini seems convenience but it's a very long boring walk when you need to walk back everynight along all the same boring platforms. The shops outside is just some vey cheap snack bar which I would not walk in as there are plenty of good local cafe and bar in the neighbourhood.. The hotel has a good mini gym by European standard with a few cardio machines and some free weights. The hotel itself is supposed to be a hip hotel with tasteful design, however the whole design is a disaster which did not take into the consideration for traveller's needs.

There is no sofa or any proper comfortable seats inside the room. The bathroom has the worst design among the hundred of hotels I have visited. I will only give a 3 stars if it has no gym or pool. The open bathroom has the worst design overall and the edge is very dirty. All bedside reading lights are broken and the bed is shaking! I did not try the restaurant in the hotel as there are plenty of local restaurants outside. I would recommend to walk a bit further into Cavour or Via Cernar areas to avoid the tourist restaurants. Although many past reviews say the hotel area is not safe as the neighbourhood is mostly occupied by foreign immigrants, but I find it OK. Just because you see many black and Asian people there doesn't mean it's a a crime area ! Overall, i would not recommend anyone to use this hotel unless they charge the usual off peak rates.

I wish I'd read more TripAdvisor reviews before booking. It clearly has 5* aspirations, certainly charges 5* prices, but fails to deliver in all areas including the basics. I was drawn by the 7th floor pool with views of Rome it advertised. Well let me tell you now, this is far from the idyllic panorama of terracotta wonderment I'd envisioned. The east and west views were walled off, the Southern view was of blank walls, satellite dishes, cables and tv ariels, nothing even remotely pretty, let alone historical. And the northern view was the rail hub with approx 14 sets of train tracks terminating there. The squeals from the constant influx of trains were the closest we got on that rooftop to ambient noise. Ever the optimist, I was determined to find the silver lining, if not just for the sake of happy honeymoon memories with my newly betrothed. However, I was shot down at almost every turn. The swimming pool was surrounded (and I do mean completely encircled) with ants. The two poolside ladders providing access to the water were on the point of collapse, one had red and white tape wrapped around the handles, but nothing to prevent its use, certainly no other obvious warning or sign of prohibition. The water was freezing cold, though I tried to convince myself it was bracingly refreshing. After swimming one length I realised the interior walls were covered in dirt and scum. I managed to dissuade my wife from jumping in just in time. The first bedroom we were issued (not shown to), despite booking as newlyweds, had twin single beds. While I considered pushing the beds together, the mrs went to freshen up, only the bathroom light wouldn't turn on. It was a modern touch-panel lightswitch, only the touch panel was so encrusted in dried gunk that it didn't register anyone was touching it. I sought refuge within the cheerful pamphlet by the phone which read \"100% satisfaction guarantee\" I called down to change rooms. With a 5* hotel booking I'd originally assumed a standard room would suffice, this clearly wasn't the case, so being on honeymoon I decided to upgrade to a jr suite. No apology was made for the condition of the original room and a full upgrade fee was charged. However the service I received was prompt and a porter even helped with our bags to move us to another floor. The Jr suite was much larger and appeared clean, so we thanked the porter and we settled in. The modern interior that I'd seen pictures of prior to booking appeared a bit cheaper and a little tacky in real life, but it was what I'd booked, so we went with it. What I wasn't prepared for though, was just how transparent the bathroom wall and door would be. Na\u00efvely I had imagined the opaque glass would be misted enough to shield toilet procedures from the rest of the room. Not so in the Radisson Blu Rome, it appears they wanted me to share the experience. On closer inspection the waterproof edging from showers was coming away, scum was left on the shower floor, layers of dust had built up on the air-conditioning grates where the wall joined the ceiling and the grates themselves looked like they were about to fall down. The array of light switches and master switches all over the room needed an Enigma code cracker to make sense of, the 3\" thick headboard wobbled and when tilted you could see a build up of gunk and matted hair underneath. Every window in our room had a dusting of brown dirt on the outside making photographs of the view impossible to take. On our second night, when we moved a chez-long, it revealed a gnarly, ripped big toenail in the rug underneath. The small gym, hot-tub and relaxation area with granite showers were the only parts of the hotel we found any solace in. And that's only because we went at night when no-one else was there, so it felt like a private spa just for the two of us. Staff were friendly enough, but they seemed completely unaware that their services were any less than the absolute highest quality. On checking out I realised we had been charged for breakfast both mornings despite booking the no breakfast option and not dining in the hotel at all. This took almost an hour and the last of my patience to rectify. Finally, the location of the hotel is very good for rail links, however the surrounding streets are dirty. Not just city living dirty, that I can handle, I mean DIRTY! Urinated on walls, poor lighting at night, I even found a hyperdermic needle on the ground less than 50m from the hotel door.

You can get a very cheap (4 euro) bus from the airport to the Termini which is a few minutes walk from the hotel which makes it convenient for travel and we walked from the hotel every day to the main attractions. I would say I wouldn't want to walk home late at night as a single female but that would be true of any hotel not directly in the centre of all the action. The staff were all extremely friendly and offered some good advice about local restaurants etc. There is definitely a sense of style over substance with the way the hotel has been designed however. The lights were very difficult to work out - and it was easy to accidentally knock all the lights on when trying to get to the bathroom in the night. The 'bedside tables' had a slope on them that meant you could easily send your glass of water sailing over to the other side of the room and our air con was broken. The layout also means that the room would be no good for friends travelling together unless they are happy to bare all - the toilet is just about private but the rest of the bathroom is just open to the room. However there was a great coffee machine, a nice balcony for a bit of fresh air, a super comfy bed, enough space for our clothes etc and the breakfast offering was the best I have ever seen.

We returned to the hotel mid afternoon and our room was ready, we had been upgraded and had a wonderful balcony on the 5th floor, our room was fantastic, super king size comfy bed, reall, great bathroom, modern with shower and jacuzzi bath tub and not a hint of any problems that others have mentioned. The hotel is next to Termini station so you can hear announcements but were from London so a little noise didn't bother us what so ever. lights were easy to use so not sure what others mean when they say you cant work them! it was my wifes 40th birthday and the manager Andreas sent us a really nice bottle of sparkling wine which was a nice gesture and all the staff generally made us feel really welcome. The breakfasts were great and consisted of cereals pastries, cold meats, toast, eggs, bacon....generally something for everyone! The roof top swimming pool looked amazing but we were to busy checking out the sites to use it. The location isn't right next to the main attractions but its only 2 or 3 stops on the metro to the Coliseum on the Blue line and Spanish stepps/ Trevi fountain on the red line, both lines go from Termini and only costs 1 Euro which you have 75 mins to use, or just buy a Roma pass. Termini isn't the nicest location and major Train stations always attract there share of problems, there was a few undesirables walking about but no one bothered us, its pretty much like Euston/Kings cross if I was to compare it to London, One tip id give is to walk inside the station if coming back late at night, you can stay inside pretty much all the way down the road until your right near to the hotel. Theres a Spar across the street from the hotel so stock up, much cheaper than hotel prices:) All in all I'd come back to this hotel, I think they are slowly but surely renovating all the rooms, they probably need to reduce the rates until its finished but hotel prices in Rome are expensive anyway so...

So the hotel came to the rescue with organising another triple room and the housekeeping people breaking every rule in the hotel by organising separate beds and the room with more private shower room and toilets, although each room had cloudy glass doors.

It's close to the main train station which can be a plus or minus (it was a plus for me as I arrived by train, but it's not a nice area so I probably wouldn't recommend it for, say, a lone female traveller or a family). As other reviews have noted, it isn't 5 star quality (more 3, maybe 4). The rooms have been got at by a modernist designer trying (but failing) to be clever, who has sacrificed style for substance. For example, the shower is in the room itself, built into the same basic structure as the bed. It looks kind of cool but I found it just plain weird, and more importantly, impractical. The flat rectangular box that forms the shower base naturally sinks ever so slightly with successive guests weighing it down, making the drain the -highest- point in the shower base - and you don't have to be Issac Newton to know that water won't flow uphill. Mine was also blocked on arrival, and still didn't drain well after maintenance attempted to fix it. I wouldn't have wanted to be sharing accomodation with this design either - a bit of privacy while showering is preferable in that situation and the steam from the shower is best confined to the bathroom. The advertised Jacuzzi wasn't working and the swimming pool is outdoor and not useable in the winter. The poor design was, at times, combined with poor service: they usually don't answer the phone on the 'one touch service' nor the '100% satisfaction guaranteed' speed dial buttons (eventually got through on the latter to some woman who seemed most displeased at being interrutpted). I was persistent, and emailed their head office - after which the hotel manager was profusely apologetic and fought valiantly to restore my confidence, including moving me to a better room with a proper shower in which the water goes downhill rather than pooling around your feet - although this one was on an upper floor and it took a good couple of minutes for hot water to get there (which was alright once you know that - you can turn it on a couple of minutes before you want it - presumably the same idiot designer put the hot water tanks in the basement). Because of his efforts (he really did try hard once the issues were brought to his attention) I'm giving it three stars, an 'average' rating. I'd give his personal effort five, but he was let down by his colleagues and by what he had to work with. Would I come back? No, probably not: no amount of effort on the 'software' front of customer service and remedial gestures from the management (lovely as those were) can change the 'hardware' problem that whoever designed this place didn't really do it with function in mind.

I will also advise that it isn't situated in the safest area either- you will either be walking briskly past the ferrel cats that line the streets, avoiding the urine stench from the local park or all out not trying to look sideways at the shifty characters lurking in the many alleyways and backstreets that you need to navigate through.

The rooms are ok, however the shower is in the room just behind the bed... so the design is pretty weird..

The a/c works well and the hotel seems to run efficiently from the guest's point of view.

Still Radisson BLU has one great attraction, a roof top pool. It is not a refuge but a retreat [white flag flying] for urbane guests, seeking sanctuary from the urban jungle that surrounds it. The brave post-modernist facade hides the reality of premature ageing concrete monolithic. Everything is a bit frayed around its minimalist edges. New technologies, especially rapidly growing ones make for higher levels of obsolescence, which isn't good ecology. The Radisson must consume energy like a blast furnace, due to all the glass. Everywhere is air conditioning yet there wasn't a solar panel in sight. Maintenance at a basic level, such as window cleaning hasn't happened for a long time. Yet the army of cleaners struggle on coping with the design disaster. Guests have to weld a heavy plate glass door simply to use the wc. The rubber floors are great, but why place a shabby shagpile rug, which cannot be cleaned on top of it? The bed is mounted on a floating hardwood raft that incorporates the sink and shower tray. Inviting you to clip your ankles before you stand under the fixed shower head that pours a torrent of water on your head like it or not. A large plastic bag-like wall light adorned the wall, which demands that you turn it on, when it inflates, otherwise it just looks flaccid.

Worst of all the uber cool aspirations of this hotel rest too heavily on the humble maid. Progress shouldn't mean any more pit ponies, and my heart goes out to them. No amount of design will water the plants and remove the dead trees about the pool, or replace plants missing outside in the courtyard. Anything that is shabby, dead or pointless recycle.

Hotel reception/ lobby area was futuristic looking but dark, check-in was smooth and staff ok. We had booked a standard room which was generally clean and average size for european standards but very quirky. One of the lights had an inflatable shade? (see photo). The bed was positioned facing the windows, the shower/bath and hand basin were in the middle of the room behind the bed separated only by a glass partition. The toilet was however not as exposed and in a separate room. The orange paint was peeling from around the bath, there was some mould/mildew in parts and the controls were difficult to operate. The wardrobe consisted of a clothes hanging rack positioned to the side of the bed and open cupboards opposite. I can see the hotel was trying to achieve a modern/contemporary look -reminded me of IKEA but it didn't quite work somehow.

If you put anything in the room safe, make sure the safe itself is secured. Sounds silly doesnt it. But here's what happened. I put some valuables in the safe: passport, wallet, credit cards etc. things I would not carrry with me when walking around Rom, dialed in my \"secret Code\" and closed the door. When I closed the door I noticed the safe moved slightly on the shelf it was sitting. So I investigated further. To my surprise. the safe was not fastened to the shelf at all......not a single bolt, it was just sitting on the shelf. I was able to take the safe out and carry it under my arm ( made of sheet metal with a slightly sturdier front) down to the main lobby .........where by the way, no one seemed to be concerned that a man was walking around the lobby with a safe under his arm, I told my story to the attendant and she seemed surprised and immediately sent the maintenance guy to my room. He \"tried\" to fasten the safe using 2 small wood screws. After he left I checked the security of the safe by applying a small jolt, the safe was free again to carry around town during my sight seeing adventure in Rom. I gave up. Just secured my items my own way. Oh yea. apparently if you don't tip in this Hotel, you will simply be ignored. My mini bar was out of order. Full of nice warm drinks , melting chocolate etc. They could not replace or repair it so I asked for compensation in some way (reduced room charge etc.) which was rejected by the managment.

I didnt tip the young man that brought the ice as I felt inconvenienced and paying for a servvice I did not receive, definetly was not going to tip for that.

Upon arrival there was no body to help me with my luggage, but the lobby was spectacular and the girl at the reception desk was friendly, so I felt happy. However going upstairs that feeling rapidly disappeared. the corridors looked depressive and were badly maintained. the room was small (but he this is rome, so i was not surprised) and despite the modern design appeared as a 3-star hotelroom. There was no Appropriate closet, only one powerpoint far away from the bed, no comfortable chair, but above all no desk!! I went to the reception to ask for a room with a desk and i was referred to the bussiness center, I indicated that a desk in my room was essential but they did not have nother room available and said some guests like this hotel others dont.... But I was promised another room the next day. The next day iwas told the other room was vailble at 14h, i had to call 5 times to arrange the roomchange. The new room indeed had a Desk, but the carpet was very dusty,, it seemed to be unused for a time, there was only one powersupply away from the desk so i called for An extension cord, than the safe did not function, i decided to ignore, than the toilet did not work, so Ii called reception again and somebody came to repair. Next internet did not work in this room..... Back to reception... There the said it was my apple laptop that gave the issues, butvthe laptop did function in the lobby, then they gave me a cable, but there was no place to pkug it in.... I became really desperate especially since i got the impression that i was doing difficult. Was i? The only thing i asked for was to be able to work in my room in this 5 star hotel.... Finally the office that booked my room told the reception that i was a vip and than things started to move forward. A really nice It manager came to my room, admitted that this room always had an internet problem and took drastic measurements, he had a hole made in the wall and a cable connection was made, it took about an hour and he stayed to check whether everything functioned and he also had the carpet cleaned. Later on a plate of fruit and candy was bought to mke up for the inconvenience, which was nice, but could not make up for the lost hours and change my feelings about this hotel anymore. Neither could the awsome rooftop area or the fine breakfast. This hotel just doesnt seem to be suitable for guests, i did not mention many other inconveniences, because it is just too much, it seems that the design has got more attention than guest comfort and the staff doesnt know how to compensate for this.", "Date": "July 25, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "3", "Sleep Quality": "2", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "2", "Service": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cOver-priced, need renovation but nice pool and terrace\u201d", "Author": "Abeille-Jaune", "ReviewID": "UR115712817", "Content": "The pool and terrace rescue this hotel: the rooms looks somewhat \"cheap\", unrenovated and are bad isolated from the other rooms, but clean.

It's pricey, but it tends to offer a combination of great modern design, good location and good service. I booked the Radisson Blu because it was recommended by the Wallpaper City Guide. The guide also mentioned that the hotel was originally launched by the same people who opened the Ripa Hotel, also in Rome, only in Trastevere. I stayed at both places while in Rome, and I could see resemblances (same pebble pattern on the carpets, same cloud-like light fixtures). Given their history (roughly 10 years, a LONG time in the Hotel business), these two places seem to have gone down two different roads. The Ripa went downhill, while the Radisson managed to keep some rooms in decent shape. When I stayed there, I was first assigned a tired smoking room (even if I had asked for non-smoking). I went back to reception and was told that I could be given a different room, only one that would be facing the train tracks, which are noisy. I put up a fight and said their policy was \"100% Satisfaction Guaranteed or you don't pay\". They finally gave me a non-smoking room, on the sixth floor, which was a little smaller but had its own balcony, apparently a kind of upgrade. I was pleased. I think the hotel is okay. The breakfast is not included and would have cost 25 euro per morning, which I find shocking considering the price of the room. The hi-fi is included and works well. Yes, the shower is a little tired, and there are stains on the comforters, but I am ok with that too, given that the room was clean enough. The location is convenient but makes for noisy pool scene and noisy rooms, at least in half of the building. And the complimentary spa and pool area are brilliant. Check in was difficult, but check out was smooth and very friendly. Overall, I would say Radisson: a) Train your staff b) Revamp the rooms c) OR lower your prices I recommend to stay at the Radisson if you need access to Termini train station, and make sure to ask for a room AWAY from the train station.", "Date": "July 4, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "1", "Sleep Quality": "2", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Service": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Saint Paul, Minnesota", "Title": "\u201cToo funky to be functional.

However they all have one thing in common in that the designer has tried to be too clever and what is initially a novelty soon becomes frustrating - too many light switches scattered around the room, lights that don't work, showers that flood the room (most rooms have the showers within the main bedroom). It may have been cutting edge when the hotel first opened, but is now looking a bit tired and could do with some refurbishment. However, the rooms are not unpleasant, the beds are comfortable and the aircon works effectively. Other positive points are the bar and swimming pool on the top floor with good views, great breakfast selection, gym and free WI-FI. The biggest issue is the location of this hotel: It is next to the Termini which is the main central station, which is fine if you need to use it (and the airport train is literally across the road from the hotel); however if you have a room facing the station (rooms x01 - x14) you will hear the trains and announcements. The area around the Termini (and the hotel) is situated in an ethnic area where you get lots of men standing around in groups in the evening, although I never found these threatening. Some of these are near the entrance of the hotel, and it is surprising that the hotel doesn't employ security guards to move these people on. The area though is run-down and walking alone is best avoided late at night. Saying that a 5 min walk takes you into a more tourist area with restaurants and bars.

Toilets have glass door... there is no concept of intimacy in the rooms of this hotel. No proper desk to put your pc or belongings, no wardrobe... the empty room might look nice but once 2 people settle in, regardless of how tidy they are the room looses the purpose: you end up jumping from one empty square foot to another.

The only downside of the stay was that after you've had a shower, water leaks through the room and we also had a little bit of water leaking from the room above us.

On top of that, one of my rooms (yes I tried 3 of them) had no countertop next to the sink, and all rooms had a contoured plastic \"desk\" with a bench bolted on that was supposed to swing out to allow you to sit facing the desktop were it not for the shag rug next to the bed getting in the way. But even if a person were okay with the design aesthetic, they would have to concede that this pathetic attempt at minimalist chic is well past it's prime with the doors and desk coming apart, a showerhead that squirted more water sideways out of the joint between showerhead and pipe than out of the head itself, and the musty odor of funky shower curtain permeating the room. Add a bed that's hard as a rock and the blare of train announcements from a window facing the rail station, and you have a complete picture of my misery. To add insult to injury, I ordered room service for breakfast and after waiting an hour, I called back down to inquire and they said the kitchen had my order but had not recorded which room it was for. By the time they delivered it I barely had time to eat before my meeting and upon lifting the lid after the attendant had left, I discovered that instead of my order of eggs and fruit, they had only brought fruit but alas no time to fix the error. The meeting rooms were okay, the one we were in was quite large, the AV worked fine and the beverage and snack service was well tended. I have to question the cleanliness since we discovered a trail of congealed prosciutto on the floor near the windows at one point. The lunch buffet was okay, but not worth the exhorbitant amount they were charging us. A couple of the staff were very nice and helpful such as Vincenzo at the front desk who helped me move from my room facing the train to one on the other side that had a glass shower instead of the karate kid curtain, and the maintenance man who fixed the power outage in my room. Most other staff were brusque or apathetic.

We booked this hotel on internet and got 10% off. Since none of us has been to Rome before and we were going to have a very intensive schedule for visiting many sites, so location and comfortable room was of primary consideration for us. Before the trip, I read on TripAdvisor about this hotel, many criticizing its location for being too close to the sleazy Termini. And its dysfunctional over-designed room amenities. We took the Leonardo Express from Rome's Fiumicino Airport to Termini Station. If you sit by the left side of the windows in the train along its moving direction, you will see Radisson Blu Hotel right by the rail when the train approaches Termini. What you must do is not to walk to Termini's main exit, which is about 5-10 minutes walk. You should take the first exit downstairs you see, very close to the front end of the train, where you will see one exit to Cafeteria, the other to Via G. Giolitti. Take the one to Giolitti, go down and turn right, you will enter a small hallway. Exit it and cross the Via Giolitti, walking along Mamiani, the hotel is just one block away, and will take you no longer than 3 minutes to walk from the train. I'd say, if you take Leonardo Express to the city, this hotel is the closest you can get. The metro station Termini is actually 10 minutes by walk from this hotel. The closest Metro station is Vittorio E, which is 2-3 minutes walk. The hotel should make this location more evident on its internet site. I guess many guests have made the mistake by taking the metro station Termini. The area around the hotel, close to Termini, is not one of the most pleasant in Rome. It is in fact like a China town, with equal amount of Africans walking around. But besides the over-representation of immigrants, the area is quite safe and it is not like you will get mugged on the street. So although it is \"sleazy\", it is not unsafe. The check-in was done without problem. Once we got in the room, we realized why some people described it as technically challenging. The switches in the room will really take you about 5 minutes to work out, which is controlling which light. We are actually both quite tech-savvy, and it still took some time. Even the shower and bath will take you 3 minutes at least to figure out how to use it. Yes, it is true this hotel room is over-designed, it looks cool, but it will challenge your technical curiosity. By the way, I brought a electric extension cord after reading some reviews, and it was really helpful. There is no spare socket anywhere in the room. In order to charge your telephone, computer, and so on, you will have to bring the cord yourself. The room was clean, towels were fresh and the toilet has even a bidet. The bath tub does show signs of wear and could have been cleaned a bit better, but the water was hot and plentiful, and there were all the usual shower gels and all the stuffs you are used with a 5-star hotel. The first night was very hot, and we didn't figure out how to control the room temperature in the wall-mount panel. The second night we had the window opened so we could sleep better. I can imagine in a hot summer night, some people might have problem with this panel. The hotel breakfast was reasonably good, at a price of 26 \u20ac per person. The Cafe latte tasted like powdered or slot machine type. But classical Italian espresso was fine. The breakfast was both Italian (coffee, bread, lots of different cured meat), continental (musli, yoghurt) and English (potatoes, sausages, bacon, mushroom, egg, etc). The evening a la carte dinner in the Zest restaurant was surprisingly good and not too expensive comparing with a in-town dinner. Of course, you may not have the intimate atmosphere of dining in those Roman restaurants in the city. All in all, I find this hotel to be very well-located, very close to subway and Leonardo Express train. Lot of buses are coming to Termini, especially bus 70 and 71 stops right out side of the hotel. So if you take the bus from T. Argentina, you will be back to the hotel in 10 minutes. And from the hotel you will take about 10-15 minutes to walk to Colosseum. This good location enabled us to have a very efficient sightseeing in 3 days, the first day we checked in at the hotel by 2.30 pm, and by 4 pm we were already touring St. Peter's Church, and later that evening had dinner in the lovely Trastevere neighborhood. The next day we went to Vatican museum and Sistine Chapel in the morning, later in the afternoon we went to Colosseum, Roman Forum, and Fountain Trevi as well as Spanish Steps. Yes, we were tired but managed to see a lot. The third day, we went to the Gallery Borghese in the morning, and then took the bus to Museum Capitolini afterwards followed by walking to Pantheon. Afterwards we walked to Piazza Navona and from there walked across the Tiber to Vatican and stopped by the St Angelo. Rome in late February was wonderful, not too cold and not too hot, even better, not too many people. We booked the Vatican museum visit online, so we did not wait in the queue. We also booked the Gallery Borghese (you must book it!). Otherwise, the 3 day Roma Pass has also enabled us to skip the queue in Colosseum and Capitolini. The only queue we had was in front of St. Peter's, but the queue moved very quickly. I find Rome very pleasant, not at all like what has been described to me by all my friends: long queue, robbery, pickpocket, faked police, and so on. Using common sense, you surely can tour Rome safely.

Fantastic cool design and specially the combination of a totally white room and a green puffy carpet.

Last minute, we had decided that instead of going to Zurich from Paris by train and then onto Rome, we would book flights straight from Paris to Rome. I went on LastMinute.com and got a good deal for \u20ac388 for 3 nights for a double room, and saw good reviews about this hotel so went ahead and booked. On the flight from Paris to Rome we had a stop over in Cagliari, and upon arrival in Rome we discovered the airline had left our luggage in Paris, so we left the airport on a Saturday night with nothing more than our handbags. We arrived at the Raddison, and found that the area outside the hotel was very dirty with a lot of dodgy people hanging around. We quickly got inside, and were amazed at how great the place looked. They said they had no record of our reservation but just had me send the confirmation email from LastMinute.com through to them and charged us at those rates with no problem. We explained to the people on reception about our luggage going missing and they promised they would let us know if they heard anything from the airline and were very friendly and helpful. During our stay they called the airline a couple of times for us as we could not understand Italian. We were meant to be switching to a different hotel in Rome on the Tuesday but after our luggage hadn't yet arrived we decided to book flights back to Sydney and see if we could stay the Raddison for another night. They were all too happy to let us do this, however we paid almost \u20ac200 for that extra night as that was their normal rate. The room itself was very nice, apart from the bathroom and the bedroom only being separated by a glass wall, and the door to the toilet only being made of glass. The beds were comfortable and they were cleaned daily, and there were electronic blinds as well as other curtains which helped keep the sun out very well. And there was little to no noise at all. We were not happy with the location though - sure, it was close to Termini Station and a lot of little restaurants, but we did not feel safe walking around those streets, even in the daytime. To go sightseeing, we just decided to get a taxi from Termini Station to most places as that was only about \u20ac8. Our trip was ruined a bit by our luggage being lost but everybody at the hotel was very friendly and the service was great. We did order from room service one night but the prices were VERY expensive for a tiny meal, and the wine was also extremely expensive - cheaper to buy a bottle somewhere else.

The hotel, especially the rooms, have become rather worn out and do not appear to have been renovated over the years. However, other than the normal wear and tear, everything is in good working condition. Some of the negative criticisms of the hotel are perfectly understandable as the layout of the rooms at the Radisson Blu is not conventional by any standard. The hotel is somewhat of an acquired taste which I have come to like, which is helped in some part by the perfect location of the hotel which is within walking distance of the main railway station in Rome (from which you could catch the Leonardo Express train to and from Fumicio Airport), as well as many of the main attractions in Rome (eg the Trevi Fountain, Plaza Novena, Spanish Steps - a rather long walk though) and the hop-on-hop-off touristic buses pick up point. Also, the abysmal hotel I stayed at during my first trip to Rome has made the Radisson appear so much superior in comparison. During my most recent stay in Dec 2010, I was given a free upgrade to a superior room on the 6th floor which had a balcony. Again, room looked tired, but all the basic comforts were there eg comfy bed, brilliant toilleteries and a big flat screen TV. The only caveat I would make is that I have always stayed at the Radisson during off-peak seasons and therefore always paid discounted rates (average Euro 160). I could imagine someone paying the normal rate (whcih is in excess of Euro 225) feeling short-changed as the hotel rooms are not opulent by any standard (and indeed look very tired compared to when I first visited in 2003).

The Termini has a few snack shops (with rude service people-but that is another story) BUT also a very nice market where you can buy food. We were able to get a room right away-if we got the \"train\" side. The clerk said you will be on the 5th floor, so it will not be as noisy. HA. All in all, it was not too bad. The noise, for me anyway, was like a white noise in the background, until a train blew its whistle in the morning. There are several hidden compartments-have fun looking for all of them. PS the safe is your standard safe. However, it is not attached to anything-so although your stuff is in there, anyone can walk out with the safe. The tub has an alarm pull string hmmmm. The only thing we could come up with is when you are in the tub, and should water rise up to the sides, you would not be able to open up the door anymore.

Do not pay 5 star prices for this place or you will feel badly let down. Initially read the reviews on here then worried a little about our what our stay would be like. First off, it did not diminish our trip to Rome. The room was pleasant enough, tidy, nice tv, nice decor, cosy and did the trick for a 3 night stay. Although the room was not cleaned once during our 3 day stay! Got a welcome bottle of sparkling wine and some strawberries which was a nice touch. I guess any location is good in central Rome. Vittorio Emanule Metro is only 3 minutes walk which gives an easy travel option to the Vatican and other sights. Be sure to buy the 4 euro option when purchasing a metro tickets as it will give unlimited travel for the entire day. Handy when venturing back out at night. If you return after 10pm then you may feel the ambience of the area change, although it is not threatening. To put its location into context you can walk to the Colosseum in under 15 minutes.. so not bad. In fact you can walk anywhere in central Rome from this hotel in under an hour. The jacuzzi was closed when we were there. As was the pool, so no leisure options, that was disappointing. Breakfast was passable, just. All the hot options, bacon, egg, sausage etc were stone cold, on each of the 3 mornings we ate. So that left cereal and croissants as our only choice, again not what you would expect from a 5 star hotel. Drinks and meals are really expensive in the hotel. However it is much better to take yourself out to one of the many piazzas for evening meals and be entertained with the street musicians who perform at these eateries, giving you a true flavour of Rome. Piazza Navonna was really good at night . I guess had we paid full prices then we would have had cause to complain, but we didnt bother as it was just a base to visit and the trip to Rome more than made up for any disappointment in our hotel as we were harldy there. If you get a good deal (i.e. under \u00a3140 per room per night) and are only staying 2 or 3 nights then fair enough. It was good for that price..

That isn't to say it is dangerous, but rather \"seedy\", and the opportunities for shopping and eating around Blu itself are limited to a hodge/podge of haphazard venues. The hotel itself is interesting, very contemporary, clean and enjoyable; the trend with the Radisson Blu brand is to startle the senses a bit, create a unique environment. The rooms exhibit a clever use of space. My room--the smallest offered--was adequate for one person, the amenities lovely, though the \"Queen Size\" bed was, after all, two twin beds pushed together. Sleeping in the middle of the bed proved uncomfortable because there was nothing but probably a mattress pad bridging the gap between the two beds. Except for the intrusion of occasional train noise (which I found comforting), the room was very quiet, no interfering noise from adjoining rooms. It was a fun accomodation for one person. HOWEVER, it should also be noted that for TWO people sharing this room, the bathroom is open concept, not much privacy for two people. There is a restaurant atop the Blu which I frequented three times; once for a coffee when I arrived, then again that night for dinner, and the following morning for breakfast. The evening meal was one of the best taken in Rome. What I did take issue with when I went to the restaurant in the morning was the 'attitude' of the hostess. When I arrived for the breakfast, she inquired as to my name, my room number, and took the opportunity to remind me that a complimentary breakfast was NOT included in my stay. Coming from her, it sounded almost like a reprimand, rather than a reminder, I had a small breakfast, coffee, signed for my meal. I returned the next morning seeking, again, breakfast and coffee, and this same young woman completely ignored me. I waited some time to be seated and while she did appear busy--seating two other diners, addressing staff and moving a sign around--I was obviously invisible to her and not sure why. I will address that issue in a separate correspondence with the hotel. I did not dine in the hotel again. Other than that odd experience, my stay at the Radisson Blu, Rome, was enjoyable, comfortable...just hold your breath for the two blocks you must walk to get there.", "Date": "October 15, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "2", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "1", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Moscow, Russia", "Title": "\u201cNot worth it\u201d", "Author": "Cloudmate", "ReviewID": "UR83422798", "Content": "This hotel was a disappointment compared to other Radisson hotels I have visited. There is a design element there that is mildly interesting but overall it looks cheap and tired. The pool spa and pool area is ok, but there are no keys to the lockers to be had since no personnel is present at the entrance. I did notice personnel using the lockers for storing their own belongings, which was disappointing. The jacuzzi is nice with some train-spotting opportunities, and the premises are generally pleasant. They could use some repairs and cleaning, like the rest of the hotel. There is a room that was maybe intended to be a hammam but is now just a strange room with a sealed tap. I didn't try the pool since I'd have had to walk by the lifts and a restaurant full of conference guests. In general, I would say this is what happens when the interior designer and engineer have a big fight and the disigner wins. The engineer then demonstratively lets things go downhill. I wondered why Radisson took this hotel, and the location has some big advantages that could be rare in rome. The exit from the airport express is literally around the corner along with rome's termini train station, which if excellent for the conferences that seemed to be constant.

I sat down and when I was about to leave someone asked me if I wanted any coffee. 5) All the front desk staff were rude. There is NO concierge and they act annoyed when anyone asks for directions. I stood and watched the staff for five minutes and the service was about one star. 6) I called the front desk FOUR separate times over TWO days to fix my TV and they never once answered the phone. 7) The sheets on my bed were NOT changed by the housekeeping after my first night.

I trust the Radisson brand, well I did till now. Normally contemporary accommodation, quality service and good value. Not so in Rome.

Where can I start, well don't be fooled by descriptions of 5* accommodation, and certainly don't think that the extortionate price they charge is related in any way to quality...it's just not. I was on a trip around Europe and this was by FAR the worst hotel I stayed in, so much so in fact it ruined my trip to Rome. Here's the bad points, many of which are written in previous posts, I just wish I'd paid attention: 1. Not in a great area but they do try to blend in - the grafitti sprayed all down the side wall is a nice addition (not). 2. Reception - as soon as you walk in you realise what you've done...like stepping back to some outdated 80's party, this place needs refurbished.. 3. Bedrooms - horrible - bed hard, sound insulation negligible, flooring some horrible rubbery stuff. Stark white walls. Reminded me of a prison cell in a museum i visited. Feature coloured lighting in window didn't work. Window blind, dirty and torn at sides. Shower - as written many times before, doesn't work, 2 seconds hot water then stone cold. For a nice additional feature my hand held (for hair washing) attachment didn't work either - I washed my hair in the sink using a glass to pour water on for 3 days! Love the old 80''s shaggy rug on the floor. Takes you back a bit. Nowhere comfortable to sit either, some horrible metal uncomfortable bench effort. Oh, and just how many 5* (supposed) hotels have you visited who have no robes in the rooms ??? or no slippers? BTW room service is a joke too, left my room at 9.30 one morning, maid was in room opposite and said good morning....I came back at 14.30 and she was just cleaning my room then...go figure.... 4. Breakfast....yes 2* like the rest of the establishment. Long life orange juice??? After handing your room number in you were waved into the restaurant and told to fend for yourself. Clearance of dirty dishes very poor, they heaped up round you on your table and adjoining. Oh and hit and miss. If something ran out tough, be there at 8.30 and if it had gone, well it's gone..... 5. Best of all is the pitch black mystery tour from the lift to your bedroom.

Orginally I booked it because of the pool , however, as the months went by after my booking and reading all the reviews on this site I became worried at what kind of hotel we would actually be staying at. I take tripadvisor very seriously and use it before any hotel booking, sometimes if there is only a handful of negative comments I will dismiss them as majority rules considering we all have different tastes. Coming up to our July wedding I started to regret my decision and felt maybe the pool wasn't the best reason for basing my booking on. We had booked a non refundable room and if it had been refundable I would have changed at this pont so my only alternative was to email the reservation department explaining my worries. I got an email back very promptly explaining that as their hotel is very modern it isn't to everyones tastes and often this is the reason some people aren't positive it. After her email I felt alot more positive. We arrived at the hotel last Monday, receptionist was very friendly , we were upgraded to a bigger room because we were on honeymoon - junior suite i think. Now I can only comment on the room we were in but it was fab, I have only ever been in one other hotel room that I liked as much and that was in a five star in Malta!! Huge 47 inch tv, massive shower, bath was attached to bed - very funky, seperate toilet and washing area and the nicest feeling rug to walk around in. Also they provided very nice toiletries. The only negative was the train station was outside the room and you could hear trains but this did not bother us we slept like logs in the bed!! The area around Termini - well I can understand what people are saying but it is not half as bad as its been made out in reviews - homeless people are everywhere to be seen in Rome and maybe there are a few more around the train station but its not like they say anything to you. Also there are two entrances to the hotel and the back entrance was fine as far as we saw.Remember it is a very busy place so there are always tourists around. The pool - fab - great area to relax especially if you are in the summer heat! Cocktails are expensive but if you dont want to buy one don't - I didn't and I didnt feel like I'd missed out - any five star hotel I have been in before has always had cocktails that were more than the normal price but thats what you pay in five star establishments. Breakfast - I cant comment personally as we didnt eat breakfast there but we are friends with another couple who stayed there that week and they though it was great. Actually even after a 5.00am arrival back to the hotel they were planning not to miss it! Left luggage - they guy there was really nice - took our luggage no problem and looked after our wedding album , dresses etc.. So all I can say is if you like cool, chic , and modern book this hotel if not maybe another hotel in Rome would be better as the style is different!!

Also Junior Suites have the advantage that the shower soaks only the entire bath corner, but not the mattresses of your bed - as it seems to be the case in standard rooms. The room is open plan with no separation between tiny bath and room which is very uncomfortable. Only the smelly toilet is visually separated by a glass door. Our window had the sad view to the regional platform at Stazione Termini while the windows to the internal courtyard will present you unpleasantly intimate view to your opposite neighbors.

Good points: A great bed Hot water (yes, I'm having trouble finding any good things about this hotel!) Bad points: Service. I asked for a non smoking room, and got smoking room without being asked if this would be ok. And before you ask, I did book 3 months in advance for this holiday!

Yes it's modern, however the quality of the build is really poor, and on top of that it's poorly maintained. Walls were filthy, lighting system was confusing, the shower door didn't close and lighting was very dim. It was generally very very tatty. (not what I would expect from a 3 star hotel) Breakfast. Don't bother. The food you get from the vans scattered across the tourist attractions have a higher standard! Noise levels. As I mentioned, I stayed 3 nights. Each night there was something that either kept us awake, or woke us up. The first night it was the fire alarm (No idea on saftey. We rang the reception to tell them about the alarm. It was quickly turned off...but what caused the alarm I have no idea! The second night it was the local kids outside playing their loud music. The third night (Sunday), the hotel seems to run a night club on the top floor....thumping music throughout the entire hotel.

Shower doors doesn't close properly, and therefore it scratches bathtub every time. - Also agree with other comments that it's fairly hot during spring when the air con doesn't work, but that happened in our Barcelona hotel also I am thinking it may just be a normal thing for Europe(?!). I think in the end we just swtiched off the heater so at least hot air won't come out. - The pool and jacuzzi was out of action for maintainence which was disappointing because it's quite a nice warm spring day when we stayed -The first room we had was facing the train station, and it was BAD. The trains were so loud and we were woken up at 6:30am in the morning. The redeeming factor was that the staff were really helpful when we complained and they helped us change rooms. At first there was only the handicapped room available but the staff took the initiative to look at whether there are any cancellations and find us a similar room we had the previous night on the quieter side.

I really love the design of the place. The reception, the rooms, even the food is creatively designed. It makes a huge change to the normal blandness of city hotels. However in all of this, they seem to have forgotten two key ingredients. Service and maintenance. Let's start with the basics. If you are hotel and put an espresso machine in a guest's room, and the guest uses it, when you remove the dirty cup, do you a) replace it with a clean one, or do you b) not bother. Over several days of dwindling coffee supplies and working through the assorted glasses and other beverage containers in my room to find *something* to hold my morning coffee, I had to resort to leaving a reminder for the maid to kindly leave some new espresso cups and refills. In a 5* hotel? Then with the more complex stuff... if you have a huge party on your rooftop bar, which guests should you book into the rooms beneath it? a) Those people attending the party, or b) business travellers who probably want a quiet night's sleep? Having a huge party above your head, with the aircon vent for your room seemingly somewhere near wherever all the smokers are congregating, is not fun. The hotel rooms are also in need of a bit of a tune-up. The rooms are really very well designed, but are getting a bit rough around the edges. I'm not suggesting they should strip out the rooms, but the are basics that they should sort out, like heavily-scuffed tables, or the fact that my bed's headboard could move 6in back and forward, presumably after being subjected to years of abuse from amorous guests. OK, so the food is good, there's free wi-fi (always a bonus), but the level of service and room maintenance is really that of a 3* hotel, and it just lets it down. If you're in Rome for a weekend and want to stay in a cutting-edge, designer hotel, then this is the place for you.

No chairs, only a hard-plastic chaiselounge with extremely thin cushion, not comfy at all. You are supposed to do anything in and from the bed, which has back supports. My back support was out.of-order, not possible to straighten up. Only a small shelf for toiletries over sink, this also behind bed, within room. Items had to be placed on elevated floor. TV with arabic channels, BBC World, CNN, all the Italian channels, movie channels. Also French, Spanish, Austrian channels. When entering room there was a definite smoke smell, either from the room attendant or from former guest (we had not asked for smoke-free room). Clean. Good ventilation, no odour when we came back a few hrs later. Soap was missing, did not ask for one, (as a test), we had one next day, but only one piece to share among two persons.

Bus is only half the price of Leonardo Express Train, but takes longer time.

The sink in the second room.....please note that I didn't say bathroom as the bathtub and/or shower is all part of a unit behind the bed, but in the room.....had nowhere to put anything.......only on the ledge about a foot off the ground. Also very poor storage space.

Check in was fast and within 10 minutes we were in our room. Throughout our stay the staff seemed to be friendly and helpful. The room itself was not as small as some people made it out to be. We had a standard room with a bath. I agree that some of the fixtures and fittings were not working and things could do with a lick of paint. The fridge in our room did not work but that was about it. The desk was scratched up and the control buttons for the blinds and lights near the bed looked a bit shabby and wires were showing etc. I slept like a baby in the bed and found it to be very comfortable. We unfortunately had a room overlooking the train station abnd at 6am we could hear the trains an announcements but after the first night I got used to it and it didnt wake me again. This could be a problem for light sleepers. On a plus side on the first day out TV was upgraded and we got a nice big flat screen. Our room was cleaned everyday and the cleaner did a great job. The bath was also relaly big and deep and that was the best bit! I requested a bath before we left so I would advise others to do the same as the bath also has a shower. We had a few mix ups with charges to the room. They kept charging us for the nights stay and for room service. This was easily cleared up with a pop down to reception. Now lets get down to what the main issue people seem to have with the hotel......the location. I think some people may have lived a very sheltered life if they found this area dangerous or scary?! Its right by the station so is really quick to get anywhere. Its a 20 minute walk to colosseum or trevi fountain. The area near the hotel always has tourists coming to and from the station with their cases etc and I never once felt threatened, even late at night there are lots of people around.

We had a room on the railway side and had very little noise disrupting us. Also, having flown and then caught the train this lack of distance between the two was very useful! So, the decor. People also complained about the upkeep of the hotel. Firstly, this is not the average hotel, especially in Rome. I got the impresssion that the people who hated this hotel might have been better of staying in the Ritz/Savoyesque hotels on the Via Cavour. This place is ultra modern and unlike anything (at all) in Rome. For architectural purists a modern building like this could be seen as sacrilegious. For those who like that sleek, minimalist design it is amazing. Admittedly there were a few things in the room that could have been neater, i.e. a few TINY bits of paintwork, but lets face it if you go on holiday how much time do you actually spend in the room? One final note however on the room. the person who complained about only having BBC news on the TV, really, there was also CNN but do you honestly go on holiday to another country to watch English TV? The thought of only having two English TV channels seemed like startling logic to me! Also in terms of facilities the library where breakfast is served and the pool are both excellent parts of the hotel! I was amazed to read the reviews of the staff being unhelful! Every member of staff from the concierge to housekeeping and porters were flawless. They helped with every query and were fluent in English (for when my Italian broke down!) and could not be recommended highly enough. Maybe the people who found them unhelpful were making their lives difficult? Who is to say? The location. Despite the reviews I realised that the hotel was not miles away from the Colloseum and central Rome. We found that by walking along Via di Giovanni and Via Cavour we were at the Colloseum within 15 minutes. This was not a long walk and actually was a great way to really suss out and see the 'everyday' parts of Rome! Finally the people around the hotel. I was concerned by the area being described as rough. It became apparent quite early on what was meant. Unfortunately it seems that by rough the writers of certain reviews meant ethnic minorities who live and work in Rome who, after work, socialise with their friends by having a drink along the streets (remember that there is no law against this in Italy). This to me seemed perfectly sociable and non-threatening. We walked through this area a lot of times and never once felt unsafe! I find that when I am on holiday that I like to enjoy the city rather than cast judgements on the locals. For me, the area was just like walking through areas of London, a suburb full of different cultures and everyday people who work hard and relax at the end of the day.

The room was very funky and suited my taste, I thought it was fun. The staff were mixed but generally good with one or two exceptions. When I arrived they had given me a room overlooking the train station, I explained that I was on holiday and didnt want the noise of the trains in the morning so they moved me to the other side of the hotel with no problems. I was not bothered by any noise from the market nor the station. The hotel wasn't particularly busy which meant the atmosphere in the evenings wasn't great so I generally went out, I agree that it is not in the nicest area of Rome but I felt safe and was happy to walk on my own, a couple of times when it was very late and dark I easily got a taxi and it was pretty cheap. The biggest dissappointment that I had was that the pool was closed for maintenance. This was extremely frustrating because I had specifically asked before I booked whether the pool would be open for the duration of my stay and was told yes. When I complianed the man on reception was very apologetic, he explained that it was emergency maintenance and then credited all of the extras that I had charged to the room (about the equivalent of 1 nights stay) and also organised for me to keep my room late on the day of departure. I was very happy with this gesture as an apology. The hotel is really easy to get to using the train from the airport which is much better value than a taxi, it was very easy to find following the directions that the hotel emailed me.", "Date": "June 20, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Location": "2", "Rooms": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "New York City", "Title": "\u201cThe Jetsons go to Prison\u201d", "Author": "Jonster112", "ReviewID": "UR32471890", "Content": "\"That's your hotel up ahead,\" the cabbie said as we headed down a narrow Roman strada. \"You mean the one that looks like a prison?\" \"Yes,\" he laughed. \"That one.\" \"Do they issue numbered jumpsuits along with the slippers when you check in?\" Seriously, this is one strange looking hotel. At night, the rooms are framed in multicolored, neon lights which give the facade of the place an incongruous \"Hollywood Squares\" look. You expect to find Judy Jetson sitting behind the odd reception \"desk\" which is actually a cloth-covered (and rather dirty) donut-shaped enclosure lit from within. The staff and engineering personnel (our air-conditioner wouldn't come on) were all gracious and willing to help but I have never encountered such a badly-designed hotel room. Like others have said in their reviews, the tub was in the center of the room, enclosed by frosted glass, seriously cutting down on the square footage. In many hotels now, the air conditioning and lights come on when you place your room card/key into a slot inside the room and turn off when you remove it. In this room, hanging off the wall like a collapsed lung, was a ilttle inflatable egg-shaped fabric lamp like nothing I have ever seen before. When you enter, this lamp turns on and a small interior fan begins to inflate it until it becomes about the size of a small, glowing pillow. It serves no useful purpose but to be annoying, as you can't read by it, and the whir of the electric motor is constantly keeping it inflated. I'd have to say that this lamp kind of symbolized the entire Radisson/Rome experience for me. Modernity sans comfortability. The hotel sits on the edge of central Rome in a neighborhood just in back of the main train station. There is a gritty feel to the area, and graffiti is everywhere. However, graffiti is everywhere else too, so don't let that swing your opinion. If you can get a good rate, I'd give this hotel a shot. Otherwise, I'd spring for something along the Via Nazionale where you will encounter a more pleasant environment. There is one big redeeming feature to this place - the rooftop pool area. It is nicley designed and relaxing. There is a bar up there too.

Yes, around the station there are some people who could be described as having chaotic or irregular lifestyles but they posed no threat. We walked out and about after dark until late into the night and it was fine. There are a lot of budget and backpacker hotels around so the streets were always busy and the locals also are out and about. There are restaurants and bars open until late.

You can walk to some of the major tourist attractions, such as the Colosseum, or take a short bus or metro ride. The Basilica of Santa Maria Maggiore is very near as well as shops, bars and restaurants. As for the hotel: it it super! We got a room with a balcony.

At nightime, with the window closed, we slept well in comfortable beds.The balcony could do with some furniture though. There was only one chair in the room, which you can move onto the balcony so even an extra chair would have been a help. The design aspect has already been well documented so I'll only add that if you don't like modern, give it a swerve. Also, there's not much privacy. It's fine for an old married couple like us to have a shower and loo without much screening, but some parties might be a bit embarrassed. The toilet has a frosted glass door and the shower is in the room, not behind a wall or door. It has a curtain but it's not easy to be modest. The staff are ultra helpful and friendly. They couldn't do more to make your stay more comfortable. They gave us maps and advice on how to get to places, including printing off maps from the internet for us at no charge. The rooftop bar and pool is fantastic, although the pool was not heated and got a bit chilly, even in the Roman heat. You are served with nuts, olives and crisps every time you sit down and order a drink and they have a free buffet at the bar in the evenings. Drinks and food are pricey but the staff were always coming round with complimentary slices of melon and dishes of olives etc, so you do get treated very well. They also serve fine food in the restuarants. Our only major moan was that on two nights (over the weekend) the whole bar and pool area was closed off in the afternoons and evenings for private functions. This isn't fair to hotel guests who have paid to be there but can't use the facitilies. If you were only there for those nights you would be even more disappointed. I think this is wrong and should be reviewed by the management. However, when we commented on it the management did take note and we were compensated for the inconvenience.", "Date": "September 26, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "3", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "3", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "s\u00e3o paulo", "Title": "\u201cbad localization\u201d", "Author": "botticini", "ReviewID": "UR20090562", "Content": "The hotel is modern,the room needs to be painted, the walls are dirty, is confortable, but, the localization is terrible, near ,too near to Termini Station, with a lot of homeless and beggers, the staff is good a modern hotel but be alert about the localization,", "Date": "September 15, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "1", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Dammam, Saudi Arabia", "Title": "\u201cNew Style Hotel...But Lacks a lot...\u201d", "Author": "aqallah", "ReviewID": "UR19060859", "Content": "I stayed five nights in the hotel and I think the hotel was special in being designed differently.

I am a business traveller, arriving from the west coast of the united states after 21 hours of travel. I arrived at 1pm for a 2pm arrival time and asked to have a quiet room (requested ahead of time). They said I'd have to wait until the 2pm check in time to have a quiet room. I went up to the roof to the bar between 1 and 2 to have some lunch. The menu was rather sparse - I ordered a caesar salad. The salad came with chicken, although none was specified on the menu. The salad was made with mixed greens rather than the traditional romaine lettuce found in a caesar salad. It also was not really dressed, although it had a bit of some kind of mayonnaise mix on top. They brought me a full bottle of olive oil and also of balsamic vinegar, pepper and salt mills for me to dress it myself. So this was some kind of roman version of the classic caesar salad (invented in mexico if you don't know the story). At 2pm my room was ready. I had ordered a deluxe room, which means it is the standard size, but on the 6th floor with some extra accouterments. My room has a queen bed. It turns out to be very quiet and I was able to sleep well from 2-5pm after the long flight. The room has blackout shades, motorized, to completely cover the floor-to-ceiling windows. True to its advertisement, the room has hardwood floors and a built in platform bed made from the same material. I believe it is teak. The shower and sink are behind a pane of glass behind the bed. It is a very modern design, just fine for one person alone in the room, but it does not afford much privacy for two. The toilet is in a separate enclosure walled in by frosted glass. The room has flat panel TV with remote, but it is very small - more the size of a computer monitor rather than a TV. The desk is one solid slab of 1 inch thick tempered glass, cantilevered out over the minibar/safe. It works and the desk chair is quite comfortable, although not particularly ergonomic. The entire room is done in white, very minimalist, no paintings or anything on the wall. A strange sort of lighted shade that inflates by a fan is suspended from the wall over the side end of the desk. I am a big fan of hardwood floors and find that my dust allergies are much better in this room than the typical carpeted hotel room. I asked for non-feather pillows when I arrived at my room. The housekeeping staff was in the hallway and they brought them to me right away - communicating with me in italian and some hand signals (I don't speak italian but I understood them anyway). They were quite unafraid to try to talk to me with a combination of hands and fragmented english/italian and to make sure I was happy with the service. As a business traveller, I prefer to dine in my room so I can have quiet and work on my computer. I ordered room service both evenings. The first nite was fine. The second night my cheeseburger arrived barely cooked and I had to send it back. The phones were not working properly so I had to bring it up to the seventh floor bar myself to ask for it to be fixed. But that succeeded and a completely new cheeseburger and fries appeared at my door after another 20 minutes. I went to the self-serve breakfast this morning. There were alot of tourists at the breakfast, mostly from asia, north america, and the UK. The breakfast has alot of choices, both the standard hot food (eggs, bacon, etc) cereals in boxes (mostly the standard kelloggs fare), some fresh and dried fruit, pastries and toast, coffee, tea, juices, and a few bottles of alcoholic beverages. Other than the hot food temporarily running out due to its popularity, there were no problems with the breakfast and the food was pretty good. I've had much worse self-serve hotel breakfasts and not too many that were better than this. The guests were uniformly polite and well organized as were the wait staff. It is hot in July in Rome. My room has its own AC unit with a controller in the room. I need to keep my key card in the slot by the door in order to run the AC during the day. This means that when I come back after some hours, the room is a bit hotter. Nevertheless, the room AC is quite good without any problems such as mold or smell. I am quite happy with the climate control. It is reasonably quiet, although tonight I can hear people talking through the wall in the next room, although they are not terribly loud (earplugs should block out everything if need be). Overall I am reasonbly happy with my stay, in particular the room itself. The location is near the termini - which is convenient if you are coming in on the leonardo express train from FCO and only staying a short time, with business near the termini. The neighborhood is not the nicest, but it is OK during the day. I was able to walk with my rolling carry on bag from the termini to the hotel. My biggest complaint is the bar/room service food. The menu is limited and the food is rather strange. Room service staff answering the phones do not seem to know the menu very well - they can not answer basic questions about the food, such as \"what vegetables are in the `grilled vegetable' dish\". Also food preparation is mixed and for such prices (they are expensive) I would expect better uniformity, knowledge, and quality. The hotel staff (except housekeeping) seems to speak english well and they are friendly and genuinely helpful. Modulo the food I'd probably come again if I needed a hotel near the termini. I'm not sure I'd recommend this hotel for couples due to the lack of privacy in the minimalist room.", "Date": "July 22, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Norway", "Title": "\u201cFalling behind now..\u201d", "Author": "Tertitt69", "ReviewID": "UR17073593", "Content": "Have now stayed here twice, and must admit the second stay was a bit more disappointing. The hotel itself has a very good standard, but rooms are very small considering it is a Radisson SAS (where rooms always are very spacious). Even though it is purposely built in minimalistic style, it does feel a bit too minimalistic at times - such as where to put luggage, clothes etc - you will have to leave it in the way in your room. The rooms seem to have been changed somewhat as well - this time it really seems to be in favour of the minimalist exhibitionist, as the bathroom and shower is now more of an open solution. Last time there was a free surprise in the room when upgrading to one of superior standard, this time there was none. Breakfast is still great, but the selection was also somewhat reduced compared to last time. The location of the breakfast room is great though, with glass windows in all places. The fact that the air condition is not put into service at this time of year isn't a surprise, I have experienced this all other places in Italy as well and must be due to the fact that Italians freeze until temperatures exceed 30\u00b0C or so. Hotel staff is very professional and service minded, and they usually sort out most challenges that might be there - even including repairing the LCD-TV by reattaching the duct tape to the transmitter (I wonder why the power plug was out in the first place?) With a minimalistic style hotel you will be hard pressed to find anywhere to sit comfortably, including your own room, and least of all in the reception area, which feels bad when you have to wait for the room to be ready for check-in. The best place of all to be is the wonderful terrace roof, sporting views of Termini (admittedly not the most attractive 'sight') but also other parts of the city (though no known monuments apart from the cupolas of the Santa Maria Cathedral). It was therefore a letdown to find this terrace off-limits to normal guests when they had arrangements there, which happened on two out of five evenings. The hotel location is far from superb - although it is conveniently located next to the Termini station and right beside the exit from the airport express train, with a Despar store located right inside. The order and cleanliness of the vicinity was even worse than last time - overfilled garbage bins smelling in the evening, as well as some parts obviously being used as toilets. It is better to head straight inside the Termini station and walk all the way underground to Piazza Cinquecento than walk along Via Giovanni Giolitti actually.

You get what you pay for. But when such a hotel market itself as 5* and charges 5* rates and acts as 2* then it is NOT fine! First, let's speak about design. I can't believe that some reviewers in fact admiered the so-called design. Hotel looked from outside like a parking lot. Lobby with non existent seating. Prison Corridors.

No privacy inside as you can watch the person sharing the room with you showering behind the clear glass panel the divides the shower from the room, and when you open your curtains you will be fully exposed to guests in the opposite part of the hotel. Then, the location, the only good thing about the location is that it is adjacent to Termini station. It might be convient if someone is staying overnight or need the train constantly. But if you are spending more than 2 nights in Rome and will not use the station, what's the added value for that? The area is dodgy, not comfortable and nothing is in a walking distance. (30+ min)!

As previous reviewers have commented, the hotel is located next door ro the railway terminus in in Rome. And I mean next door! The view from our 'superior' room was of graffiti and line after line of railway track, as far as the eye could see. The balcony was more like a window ledge. In fact you would have struggled to put a pot plant on it. With the windows shut you can hear the trains. Pulling the shutters down did not help and Italian train drivers do not stop work at night and sound their whistles at regular intervals out of jealously of those tucked up in bed! The rooms are small and impractical - there are no wardrobes, just a small rail suspended from the ceiling. The drop from the rail to the bench below is so short that their is insufficient space to hang even a short dress, never mind longer garments. There is absolutely no storage space. The bathroom is separated from the bedroom by a clear glass panel, which would not suit everyone. Thankfully, the toilet cubicle was behind frosted glass, but still little was left to the imagination. The TV had a mind of its own and managed to switch itself on unaided by us! The corridors make you feel like you are in a prison and the service does nothing to convince you otherwise. The staff seem like students doing part-time work in holiday time with little interest in providing a service. There appeared to be a lack of experienced personnel to take charge. When we went for dinner in the hotel at 8.30 we were were told that the 'fine dining' restaurant was not available as this reserved for the conference group. The only option was the bar, where the only tables where they were prepared to serve food were occupied. We were invited to take a drink and wait for a table. We were told that food could be served where we were sitting, whilst the people next to us in the same seating area were served a three course meal from the fine dining menu. Eventually, at 10pm we were told that there was a mistake and they had forgotten us, so we gave up and went to bed! Once in bed, we were reminded of the trains - constantly - all night!!

The rates vary widely on the internet so it pays to shop around before you book and make sure breakfast is included (if you plan of having it, otherwise you will pay dearly). The hotel is not worth more than \u20ac140 per night. The Radisson is certainly not in a very glamorous location. Nestled between Rome\u2019s main train station and market buildings it is a decidedly underwhelming neighbourhood, however I should say while not a flashy neighbourhood, I did not feel unsafe in the area. On the plus side the Airport Train (Leonardo Express) is stopping right outside the hotel. Check in was a little slower than normal and this gave a pretty impression of what was to come. There was nobody assisting us with bags (of which there were a few) and what I assumed was \u201csecurity\u201d just lingered around instead of assisting guests. The reception area could do with a make over (a door at the entrance was missing, the white walls need repainting and the elevator walls are scratched). The Radisson tries very heard to be a design hotel, however this is very hard to get right unless there is a constant strive towards perfection and unfortunately they failed at this. The room was a medium sized white box with glass encased bathroom. Again a good attempt at upmarket design but unfortunately time has not been good to the design. Walls are chipped, the shower did not work properly, there is paint on glass partitions and when we got there the air-conditioning was not working either (it was 38c in Rome!). The room was lacking a sufficient number of electrical outlets so laptop and mobile phone recharger and other devices had to be alternated all the time. However as in all Radisson SAS hotels broadband was free which is great. The aircon was fixed quickly and we retired to the rooftop bar. This is the hotel\u2019s biggest asset: a stylish bar area with tree lined decking with a good size pool. The breakfast is also served on the top floor and has a decent choice of hot and cold options however the staff are totally uncoordinated and are unable to make sure there is steady supply. Frequently items such as eggs are out and it takes them forever to restock. Talking staff, the hotel is staffed by complete and utter amateurs, obviously chosen for looks but definitely not for any skills in the hospitality area. The roof top bar staff (and there are quite a few) are unable to serve tables on time and frequently it took us over 15 minutes to get served while they stand around at the bar and talk excitedly to one another. We decided to have dinner at the restaurant one night and this turned out to be the biggest disaster I have ever encountered at a so called four star property. We ordered food and wine from a young pretty waiter. 20 minutes later wine had still not materialise and when asked if we had to beg for the wine his reply was \u201cyes\u201d, while a very comic example of language difficulties it illustrated very well the total and utter incompetence of the staff. Another staff member (may have been a maitre de) came over and asked us twice for room number. Why? We\u2019ll probably never know. The wine arrived after the starter, ashtray was removed and never replaced and when the main course arrived we had enough: the food was cold and had to be sent back: Inedible junk just couple degrees warmer than a frozen meal. We requested the bill (main courses were taken off by supervisor) and left. The moral of the story here is that while the hotel certainly has some style and it has very little substance. I remain convinced that none of the staff working there have any qualifications in the hospitality industry and should either be sacked or urgently sent to a customer service boot camp to wise up. Alternatively a trip to any other four star hotel in the world might open their eyes. Pretty boys and girls are no replacement for trained professionals. I should point out though there were two efficient and friendly staff members: the pool attendant and one of the receptionists. I would hope the management, and I use that term lightly, would respond to the comments here on Tripadvisor but I noticed that they have not made use of that option so far.

Perhaps they think that sparseness of service matches the minimalist interiors. Room and hotel facilities Hotel facilities were rented out to external parties most of the time and consequently were not available to hotel guests.

After reading the reviews for this hotel, there really weren't too many surprises. The area is definitely not one of the best areas of town. There were a few sketchy looking characters on the streets but I never felt unsafe, although I did look over my shoulder alot to be on the safe side. I had read reviews about the noise of the train and asked for a room away from the station, so I never heard any train noise...although the hallway could be pretty noisey. The hotel is fine is you just need a place to stay in Rome and are having trouble finding other places that are within the city walls. The modern design was okay...definitely different, but not a negative. The light in the room that looks like an airbag was something i had never seen before. The negatives to me were the following: 1) Room just didn't feel clean. The black carpeting in the room had a number of stains and the mounting that connected the desk to the wall was barely holding the desk to the wall. I assume the desk had been repaired (poorly) recently because someone probably sat on the desk and detached it from the wall because there was only one uncomfortable chair in the room. 2) The bathroom was definitely a low point. This room, unlike some of the reviews that I have read, had a distinct bathroom that would provide decent privacy. When i first stepped into the bathroom, I noticed a large white stain on the tile floor. I wasn't really sure what is was though. Then I went to take a shower, and noticed the shower head just comes straight out of the ceiling and there was no shower curtain or any definition of a shower area. So when you took a shower, the water went everywhere in the bathroom. You would think that in such a design the floor of the bathroom would be well-sloped to drain or at least have a small ledge to contain the water. But it didn't, so the whole floor starts to flood. Hence the large white soap stain on the tile floor. I did start to put towels around the shower area to confine the water though. This may have been a handicapped bathroom, but you would expect at least a shower curtain or something. Standing right next to the toilet taking a shower is not a highlight. 3) Not business friendly. Very poor design in that the phone in the room was by the tv but the desk was on the other side of the room. So I would have to stand by the tv when i was on a call instead of sitting at the desk. Also, during my stay, I used my corporate toll-free calling 30-40 times...again i stress \"toll-free\", so no local phone expense to the hotel. However, at check-out, I was charged 2.5 euros for each connection. This has to be the most any hotel has ever charged for such a connection. I'm used to a nominal access charge, but not 2.5 euros...that was just outrageous. 4) Dining options. The restaurant at the hotel had decent food, but the prices were ridiculous in my opinion for the portions that you received. I did venture out a little in the neighborhood, but the dining options were pretty limited. If you stay here, I would recommend eating while you are away from the hotel sightseeing, etc. Overall, I would not stay here again. But, I think if you read most of the reviews here, you can make an informed decision for yourself.

The same thing happened to my work colleague, neither of us were asked our preference. The rooms are really unusual, and made a nice change from other hotels. The floor was made of rubber, which was really comfortable to walk on, especially after strolling around Rome all day. A few things didn't work, like the remote control for the TV and one of the phones. The lights could take a couple of goes to get working. The beds are really comfortable though. The breakfasts are nice, lots of choice. My one gripe would be the tea, as an Irish person I like a cup of tea in the morning, but the only thing on offer was luke warm water in jugs to make tea with. Was horrible. (no tea/coffee facilities in rooms). The biggest complaint I would have about the hotel is the pool. I jumped straight in my first day, and nearly died. It was freezing, had to get straight back out again. The second day I was sun bathing, no one could get into the pool, was too cold. What\u2019s the point?

When you leave the hotel there is an older building which houses an indoor market, with another fruit and veg market to one side. Beyond that is a lovely park and square, with a Metro station, taking you far away from the ghastly Radisson hotel. At last, you feel you are in Italy. Despite cards in all the rooms saying 100% satisfaction or your money back, the management do not care about the guests. Rooms are uncomfortable and peculiar. No wardrobe, just a clothes rack, few draweres (all well hidden), open plan bathroom, and only one seat which is a metal chaise longue moulded to the desk and impossible to get comfy in. The beds are very hard and ugly, but adequate. On arrival late at night room service did not answer. They have a 'one stop' button on the phone, but no-one replies. Apparently this is the case at any time for any one. A friend failed to book a massage this way. Hot nights in November have no respite from the advertised air conditioning. According to the desk clerk dealing with angry guests, the management decided it should be switched off in November, and it could not be switched back on. I opened a window, but this is a bit dodgy in this rough area. For some reason they have a light show on their windows. At some point in the evening if you do not press the button to make the blind go all the way down, an eerie purple or pink light glows out from the bottom of the window. Weird and wonderful taps, light switches and other essential facilities come without any instructions, so running a bath took two people half an hour to work out how to do it.

The location is a problem: a pretty, grotty and rundown area of rome that's a decent 20-30 minute walk from any of the main attractions. I didn't come across any trouble walking around the area, even late at night, but it is the sort of area where you'd be careful to keep your wits about you. The hotel imagines itself to be an ultra modern, hip and stylish hotel, but it's 'beauty' is only skin deep, if that. for a new hotel it's starting to look a bit shabby around the edges; having white leather couches in the lobby might have seemed like a good idea at the time, but they're starting to look very ragged. The lack of cleanliness surprised me. I've stayed in a number of Radisson hotels around Europe and they all seem very clean. this one is different. the lobby, elevator area is really not as clean as it should be. The gym on the 7th floor was filthy when I was there. For 3 days in a row I used the running treadmill (there's only one) and for three days in a row the same half eaten, decaying apple and snotty tissue greeted me on the little treadmill shelf. Now, it was the weekend and maybe staff weren't on, but still. The pool area and bar were out of bounds for the 4 days I was there due to it being hired out as a function venue, which was very frustrating seeing as this is heavily advertised as one of the key benefits of the place.

Having read the recent comments, I thought that I should record my experience as it was very different to most of those listed. I was initiatly very dubious about staying at this hotel because I had read such bad reviews, however, the lure of a pool when travelling with a jet lagged 10 year old won me over. I had not been to Rome for 25 years. I was delighted as to the ease of locating the hotel from the airport Leonardo Express train. My son spotted the hotel sign from the train window as we pulled into Termini Station. We were able to walk down the exit ramp next to where the train pulls in ( don't walk to the front of the train station) without difficulties and across the road to the hotel. When we arrived at the hotel after 28 hours of travel, we were immediately given our reserved room. The desk staff couldn't have been more helpful. I do agree that our room was a little tired ( ours had a rip in the blind and smelt smoky) but the beds were comfortable, and everything else worked. The rooftop pool was a god sent after a day of the walking around in the 33 degree heat. The pool staff were fantastic and, on some occassions, even let my son stay in a little later past the 7.00pm closing. In the evening, we would sometimes indulge in the free antipasto served by the pool. On some days after having been out for a big lunch this was enough to feed us for the night! Much has been written about the seedy location, whilst it is not the most charming part of town, I was not the slightest bit scared walking around at night with a 10 year old. Being close to Termini meant we had access to the supermarket for supplies and the the newsagent for transport tickets. It was also an easy walk to the metro, and the bus terminal at the front of the station was a reference point when we were lost. (We often caught bus number 'H' to Travestere of an evening to dine). We found all the staff to be very pleasant. They would joke with my son, answer his questions about the excavations in the front of the hotel, and recommend and book restaurants or taxis without a problem. I don't know whether we were just lucky, or having a child which the Italians love, meant our experience was unusual, but we really enjoyed our stay at the SAS RAdisson and would highly recommend it.

We had no quams about paying the \u20ac1000 for 3 nights in a junior suite as it looked amazing on the website - and its our honeymoon. But we were more than worried and amazed at the poor location of the hotel as we arrived. Even the taxi man told it was in a dangerous and horrible place. he was right. We had no problems checking in - and I have to add the staff were all very friendly. HOWEVER, they stated the had not got the rom we requested and had to give us a suite without a balcony. We were also tols when we asked could we go to the Restaurant and bar that it was completely closed off for the duration of our stay as its been reserved for different functions. When I asked about the swimming pool I was told the pool cloeses for winter on the 25th Sept. 2 days prior to our arrival. When asked could we still use the terrace bar around the pool for drinks - smae excuse that its closed off for an outside event?? what the hell. Does this hotel not think of its guests!! On arrival in the room we were initially pretty impressed. Then we slowly found faults with our room - mainly our TV didint work properly! and half the lights were broken. To summerize the hotel design has some good points, but it's a ll the small issues that leave a bad taste. The location is terrible and for that reason alone I would not stay here again. Plus having all the barts out of action and trying to replace them by a 1st floor buffet was a joke.

You can go sightseeing and in the afternoon you can relax at the pool, have and drink or eat something.

I arrived at the hotel at around 3 pm, after calling ahead to ask how to walk from the station -- after three calls with no answer, I finally reached the reception desk, and the man was more than annoyed with my call. I arrived to find the same attitude. I speak Italian (I lived in Italy for many years) and speaking the language didn't seem to make my experience any better. The reception is a free-for-all. The round desk does not make for an organized check-in, I waited behind a line a several people who were having problems (sending faxes, reserving rooms, asking for information), while a group of flight attendants who came in at least 15 minutes after me were served before me. There were 2 people behind the desk who were working and 4 others who just \"looked good\". You know, I am sick of the beautiful people who work in the service industry. Get over yourselves! For over 200 euro per night, I expect a better reception than being ignored by people who \"think\" they are better than that. Finally, I was checked in but no one helped me with my bags. There were at least two porters in the lobby but they were too busy with themselves to help me so I took my own bags to my room. I arrived in my room to find paint peeling off the walls and the balcony full of mold and peeling paint. There was no bottle opener in the fridge and when I asked housekeeping if I could have a bottle opener and a list of prices for the mini bar, she told me I must be mistaken. Sure enough, there wasn't the afore mentioned items and they quickly brought the necessary items. BUT, wait a second, 12 euro for a friggin' mini bottle of whisky!!!!! Heaven forbid you want to mix it with something. Cokes are 6 euro for a mini bottle. Ok. so this hotel's main selling point is the pool. Well, guess what!?! The pool is closed always for private parties, and you, as a PAYING GUEST, ARE NOT WELCOME! The second day I stayed here there was a notice in the elevator that the pool was closed from 5pm- on but the restaurant inside would be open. Well, it wasn't. When I went upstairs for dinner, I was told to go to the first floor and when I got there, I was told that only sandwiches and salads were available for dinner. This is not what I call service.

It is not like most hotels in Rome in that it is a modern, quirky and boutique-like 'hip' hotel. It doesnt have the feel of 19th century grandeur nor does it have a central location..but, that is why I love it. First of all, the modern black/white and stone design is very calming. From the lobby to the top floor bar the focus is on light and shade; on colour and transparency. Thus, you feel you are in a large space...and not in a claustrophobic 'hotel'. The location is in a 'transitional' neighbourhood - it is next to Termini station - so, cheap hostels, Asian and Indian market stalls and restaurants and African migrant workers. But, it is REAL... it is not the Disney-esque view of Rome and its monuments. The SAS brand makes sure everything is Scandinavian efficient and clean. The staff are very helpful and friendly and multii-lingual. And, the facilities are great...particularly the top floor bar and restaurant. (like the architecture...modern but enjoyable!) The rooftop pool area is excellent to enjoy the outdoors above the hustle and bustle! I warn you though...the pool is freezing, so better to sunbathe and pose than do a few laps. And, in the evening when the DJ plays and bar is open... all you really want to do is enjoy a Negroni and sunset! The Rooms Vary in size and features..but, in principle they are stark modern minimalist. Once you work out how to turn the lights on/off and shower to warm you will be fine (make sure the bell boy shows you the switches!). Crisp white sheets, excellent towels and an excellent tv/sound system. The coloured lights and inflatable car airbag lights are weird but work. Make sure you ask for a room with a tub/shower glass cubicle and not the wooden floor/tent shower. They have to get rid of that concept... The worst features.... The spa/gym is a disappointment. SO, don't stay here if that is what you want. Also, the hotel is clearly now booking large conferences and tour groups...so, be warned. The business centre is a joke...one internet pc terminal in the lobby (practically in the lift!)..but, the staff said this is being changed shortly. The tent showers and telephone on the desk not next to the bed makes wake up calls a pain. Too many business conferences and tour groups hogging the lobby 'on breaks' or pre-boarding of buses. The best features... The location. The design. The SAS service features and staff. The breakfast selection and view. The concierge(s) and the taxi calling service. The food and bar on the 7th floor. The pool deck and views. The SAS Radisson has made this previously dysfunctional design hotel 'work' but it is not for everyone.

The rooms themselves are adequate, functional and somewhat quirky - the semi-transparent glass shower cubicle and the room lighting was something that I actually quite liked. Despite the room being a little small, the room itself was ok- not great - but ok. Where this hotel falls down, is in its location AND the service it provides. The location is situated next to the main train terminal - and like in most cities, the train station is in the slightly dodgier area of town. Having said this, I had no problems walking around the area and there were always enough people around to feel safe enough. It is certainly not a pretty area and is industrialised - but the real problem is the distance from the major attractions. In the cooler months, it would not be too bad - but in the summer months, it is just too hot to be trapsing up hills and for a few miles to get to the main attractions. If you are thinking that this isnt too much of a problem because you can just get a taxi then think again. The hotel refused to order us taxis, and the taxi rank around the corner at the station awaits unknowing tourists from the airports and charges journeys at 4-5 times over the odds! The hotel also advertises that it is next to a metro stop - again, this is at the opposite end of the station, and is a good 10 minutes walk away. And now to the service. Although the staff are plesant enough - the service is terrible. Room service stops at 11pm - and although you can still order sandwiches after this time, the sandwiches are pre-made and not very nice. When I phoned to place an order, I asked what sandwiches they had - and was told that he couldnt be bothered to do and look in the fridge and would send up one of whatever there was! Like I said earlier, they would not order taxis for us. The room maid service one day wasnt done at all. There was no activities / tour desk and no small shop for basic essentials as in most hotels of its type. The air conditioning was very noisy and most nights we ended up having to turn it off in order to be able to sleep. The swimming pool area on the roof was nice - but even when it was 35 degrees outside, the water was too cold to be able to get into the pool!!

Getting there \u2013 We were confused by the map, the hotel is not close to the station\u2019s main entrance in fact if you are coming from the airport it is almost directly opposite to where the train stops so come out the first exit you can find, cross the road go down one block and turn left. Location - Others have commented on the dodgy area, well it\u2019s only slightly more dodgy than the rest of Rome and we did not experience any problems. It is slightly further out than many hotels but we usually expect to walk in Rome and it was not a big problem. Room \u2013 if you want to try minimalist this is for you. We did feel that we untidyed the room just by being there! Storage space is very limited. We had a superior room with a balcony - shame there were no seats on the balcony and only one in the room. Don\u2019t confuse minimalist with high tech \u2013 yes it has a flat screen telly and a blow up lamp but limited choice of channels, if there ever were music channels they don\u2019t work and I can\u2019t even view my bill on it. I would have expected lights in the toilet to switch on automatically - nothing so high tech you have to find the switch. The shower behind the glass looks good but sprays water on the wooden floor I was disappointed to find our duvet cover had two rips in it \u2013 not really the standard I expect from a 5 star hotel.. The mini bar is well stocked and it is not one of those annoying ones that charge you every time you open the door and rattle a kit kat. Other Facilities - We have not tried the fitness centre but we have used the pool. It is good however it is a bit annoying that they re-configure the area at 5:00 to use some of it for the restaurant asking people to move so that they can set up tables then you are left wondering where the exit is. There were plenty of staff around the pool but they always seemed more interested in talking to each other rather than looking after the guests - we seem to get in their way! All in all it was OK and just what I expected from the reviews but lets face it in a 5 star hotel in Rome you really expect grandeur not austerity.

This place is horrible. Think of it as a hotel designed by Fellini, and operated by Tim Burton. First, the location. It is located as the a---end of the train station. OK, that isn\u2019t bad in and of itself, but the environment is dirty (by Rome standards) and quite menacing. It took 20 minutes of brisk walking before we felt safe enough to slow down. No wonder the best rooms in this place look inward to the courtyard. The hotel looks like it was a really cool public library \u2013 back in 1973. It tries to look hip, but looks more like a 70-year-old woman wearing a mini-skirt with a thong. The rooms are all about form, and nothing about function. It took us 30 minutes to figure out how to turn on the lights, with the icongraphically driven room material providing no help.

Our room was excellent on the 6th floor overlooking the courtyard with a balcony - the gadets were great fun although the room didn't have a hifi or dvd but this didn't matter at all.

After reading the reviews, I must admit, I'd expected this so wasn't too shocked! We were told to come back at 2pm. We'd left our baggage at the reception, we had absolutely no problem with this as plenty of other guests have done exactly the same thing! However, on the first day, we made the mistake of exploring the backstreets at Termini - it's not the best place to start a holiday, so do please give this a miss! On our return at 2pm, we were asked whether we would prefer a quiet courtyard room - what was the alternative, I have no idea! The room was beautiful!! it was much larger than anticipated and we had such fun over the controls by the bed!!! The shower was certainly eye opening, although by the end of the first night, we weren;t so keen on getting our feet wet every time we went to the loo (the shower room, toilet, sink, bday is all in one room with no shower curtain!) The best thing about this hotel is the location, don't come back from your days sightseeing through the backstreets. Get a bus from whereever you are back to Termini station and walk down the main road beside the station back to the hotel. On the last day, we checked out at 12pm with absolutely no fuss at all!

On the plus side, my room (once I had swapped it for a twin that I had originally booked for the double that I was allocated on arrival) was spotlessly clean and the air conditioning most welcome. The pool also proved a hit after a days sightseeing, though trying to interrupt the staff chatting amongst themselves long enough to order a drink is another story. Now the downside- One has to rely on taxi's for sure in the evenings as the hotel is in an area which is a magnet for undesirables, tho from what I saw, most handy for catching a train and buying the odd provision from the nearby Spar shop. Queing at the checkout with the stations wino's is quite an experience. The es. Libris bar is a law unto itself (waited with my daughter for a sign of life but ended up getting a drink from the above mentioned Spar shop) as is check-in. Although we waited in the most bizarre queing system we where eventually checked in by a friendly and apologetic chap. Breakfast there was a huge mistake and we waited 25 minutes for the egg and sausage (?) '' servers'' to be refilled. Luckily upon bill inspection they had not added on breakfast. Phew. If you want a breakfast, walk up the road to Tuddini's on the Via Filipo Turrati as we did for the remaining 4 days. Another tip, if you want extra towels, request them the day before and forget the wake up call. This was a most unusual experience. I will most certainly be revisiting Rome, but will not stay at The Radisson SAS again and I'm afraid I cannot recommend it.

First impressions are that you are staying in a car park, as the hotel is adjacent to a multi-storey and looks out on the main train lines going into Termini, so even with double glazing the rooms facing the tracks are not quiet. Moreover, the surrounding area is very down-at-heel and not the sort of area that a woman on her own would wish to go through to get to a hotel. You wander into a large airy foyer and go to reception. Whilst there were 3 staff on reception it still took about 15 minutes before anyone dealt with us and then they seemed to have the most complicated procedures which took a further 5-10 minutes. (We had booked and paid in advance!). In addition we were told that breakfast was included only to discover on the last day that it was not included and we had to pay 25 euros per person for breakfast (and the breakfasts were not worth it!). This added insult to injury as, on the penultimate day, I had to ask 3 times for a cappuccino which finally came after some 20 minutes wait.

When the guy on reception asked if this was ok, i had to fight a massive grin breaking out and managed to reply calmly that this would be fine. When we got out of the lift (there are five or six) on our floor we realised how trendy this place was. The lights were dimmed and the number on each door iluminates to indicate whether the occupants are in. This means you won't get bothered by cleaners if you decide to sleep in.

It's a about 6 euros for beer and around 28 euros for a bottle of good wine. Champagne is 50 euros. Late afternoon/ early evening they set up a complimentry buffet on the bar which we found sufficient as a meal one night.

I've never stayed at a hotel quite like this one. It's urban, funky and cool -- there was an Italian feature film shoot going on when we arrived. Most of the experiences are unique to oridinary hotel stays, from the entirely black-clad staff, to the minimalistic furniture and room design to the pulsating house music that permeated the lobby and common areas. The entire time you feel engaged in an ambiance that can't quite be duplicated elsewhere in Rome. We visited many other local hotels --- all were of the overstuffed, luxury variety -- and somewhat \"ordinary fare\" for this city. Although it's certainly not 5-star material, there's a uniqueness to it that cannot be duplicated. The hotel met my expectations because we were prepared.

(Walk up the ramp opposite the Spar). That is the easy bit, from then on it goes down hill. For our Easter break we were lucky to be allocated one of the sixth floor courtyard rooms which had a small balcony. However, you could still hear the announcements from Termini Station. For those overlooking the station, this could be intrusive. Unfortunately, it seems the area around the hotel is home to many of the city's undesirables and this can seem a little threatening. There is no way ths hotel warrants a five star rating. However, if the service was consistently good it could pass as a four star. It is an ultra modern and unusually styled hotel. The room was disappointingly small and hotel corridors very dark. There is no ensuite as such, a glass partition separates the bed from the wash basin and the shower is also in the main room, separated by a shower curtain. The toilet is separated by a frosted glass partition through which you can still see everything! Be sure that you know intimately the person you are staying with - not a place (or area) to take your mother! One night after a busy days touring, we decided to try room service - what a mistake. When the order was brought to our room it was completely wrong. I got a (very small) portion of unremarkable lasagne with stale bread. When my partners correct meal finally arraived the burger was cold and uncooked in the middle - I asked if they were trying to kill us from food poisoning!.

Having arrived on an early flight, we expected to have to wait till the afternoon for our room to be ready, especially on such a busy weekend. It wasn't a problem, we were greeted by a very welcoming bunch of staff and directed straight to our room, with a welcome message and panetonne cake in celebration of the weekend - nice touch! The rooms are pretty cool, it must be said. I do agree with some other reviewers in that there's not much privacy when you're in the shower, but didn't you look at the images of the hotel before you booked it - this is pretty obvious? Needless to say, my partner loved it! Light switchers and controls do take a bit of getting used to, but that's part of the fun - you wouldn't have them at home. It's worth taking a few spare hangers will you just in case you tend to pack too many bits of clothing that never get worn! Plenty of hidden drawers though, enough to store a long weekend's worth of clothing. I only hope that they maintain the hotel to the standard it is now - white walls in room could easily become scuffed and scruffy in no time. We only had lunch in the restaurant, but this was fab, no more expensive that some of the bars/restaurants we came across, which was a pleasant surprise. Didn't use the pool as the weather wasn't up to it, but it did look nice. Only main negative point is the location - but what do you expect from most cities? It's the equivalent of walking around Kings Cross in London, OK in the day but not in the evening. It was nice to come out of the centre after a day's sightseeing to an area that wasn't over-crowded by tourists. Saying that, all of the tourist sights can easily be reached by the metro in the Termini station or on foot. This is our second trip to this city (stayed at the Aleph 1st time which was v.v. nice!) and having done lots of the major sights first time around, we tried to check out the less well known tourist areas. I personally think that for a first timer, you should try to see the following: - Trastevere area: lots of local charm and restaurants were filled with locals which is always a good sign. The flea market around there on a Sunday isn't as great as the guidebooks say - Colosseum: take the guided tour or buy the audio guide for Euro 4 pp, you'll get lots more from doing this than just going there to have a look - the Vittoriano monument in Piazza Venezia, just up from the Colosseum: has the best views of Rome from the cafe, especially Ancient Rome - the Vatican: priceless You could get to see most of the sights very quickly, at a glance, but suggest spending at least a day at the areas listed above.", "Date": "March 30, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Service": "1", "Rooms": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "Cleveland, OH", "Title": "\u201cDon't Waste Your Money\u201d", "Author": "Lovepets", "ReviewID": "UR3294921", "Content": "I stayed at the hotel the same time as \"Good for Little\" from London.

The hotel is in a very poor neighborhood -- one that is not very safe after dark. It is immediately across the street from Termini station so it is very convenient for day trips out of Rome. The rooms on the station side of the hotel suffer from noise from the station and the trams. All rooms suffer from poor design -- or inappropriate design. One might guess the hotel rooms were designed by an architect who has never stayed in a hotel, much less worked in a hotel room. The amenities in the rooms are very minimal -- four (yes count them, four) facial tissues, no closet (clothes hang on a rack in the room), strange lighting (requires special instructions), and no real seating other than on the bed and an odd lounge chair. The hotel evidently does not turn on the air-conditioning until summer, so the guest and conference rooms were uncomfortably warm. One could open the window to cool the room down some, but all exterior rooms are affected by street noise. The restaurant is okay, but nothing special and not a good value at all. On top of these systemic problems, we suffered through the noise of a party in the top-floor restaurant/bar on Sunday night that went to nearly 1AM. We complained to the front desk but they were not very sympathetic and not apologetic at all.

Have to say we were put off slightly by some of the reviews but ignore all them as this place is EXCELLENT. The hotel is located right next to the Termini and yes the area is not the best BUT all of Rome is covered with grafitti (even some of the monuments we went to visit!), and the shops around are interesting, mostly Chinese owned shops selling cheap (copy) clothing. We did feel safe though and walked everywhere and never felt threatened or worried about the area. The Colloseum is a five minute walk away and the main shopping street about a 15 minute walk (or a 5 minute taxi ride if youre feeling lazy). The room was excellent. We had a standard room and everything worked really well. The shower was great and the bed one of the biggest I've been in. Nice mini-bar, great toiletries and flat screen TV with DVD player. Only slight misgiving was the toilet/bidet which was in a small frosted glass cubicle at the back of the room. Probably could have given a bit more privacy. Everything was spotlessly clean and I couldnt find fault with anything and Im very fussy. The electric blind worked well and even when it was up privacy was maintained with the linen curtain. We ate one night on the 7th floor restaurant and it was one of the best meals I have ever had. The setting was great with subdued lighting and attentive but discreet waiters. The food was some of the best Ive had and the way it was served was done with professionalism and flair. We skipped the entree and while waiting for our meal were brought complementary hors douvres like tempura flowers and the like which were gorgeous. It cost 80 euro all in including a nice bottle of wine which seemed cheap I thought as we were both full (try the celery ice cream for a real treat). Considering the vast majority of places to eat in Rome were the candle in a chianti bottle variety this place stood out (some use frozen not fresh food and mark these on the menu as such!!!) and I would highly recommend eating there if you can. Overall this hotel is a real experience. I have stayed in plenty of boutique style hotels around the world but this one stands out head and shoulders above the others. When you look at the price of hotels in Rome and the type of accomodation you get for your money this place makes you wonder how they can do it for such a low price.

The location near the train station does have a couple of good positives, unlike some of the reviews. When we arrived in the afternoon from Florence by train, we were a two minute walk across the street to the Radisson. Yes, there is graffiti on the walls and all the other components around a train station, but each day after finishing our touring, we hopped on the Metro and were whisked back to the main termini. The best reason for the location is the ease with which you can get to the airport.
