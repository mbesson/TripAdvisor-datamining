We booked the hotel mainly to save money on accomodation, given that hotels at Singapore are really expensive! When we booked the room, we insisted on one with windows and we were given one. The location, Balestier Road, is a quiet, peaceful and easily assessible area, though it is not served by the MRT. We can get to Orchard Road by taking the bus in front of the hotel. The room was small, but generally clean and funiture and fittings basic but looks modern. We got what we expected of a budget hotel. The only drawback is there is no partition between the shower and the toilet bowl, so after bath, the toilet get very wet. The toilet is very small. But we were thankful to the hotel staff that night as on our arrival at around 11 pm, we found we had left our camera on the taxi that took us from the airport to the hotel. Staff on duty was very helpful and sympathetic. He called the major taxi companies to file our case. We were told that the chance was slim as we did not remember clearly the colour of the taxi as it was late at night( there are 8 taxi companies) and we did not get a receipt from the taxi driver (we should have). But to our pleasant surprise, at around 2 am, the very driver who drove us there took our bag back to the hotel!!! When asked how much we should pay as a reward, he said,' Doesn't matter! I take whatever you give!\" This left us a very good memory of Singapore and we were really lucky to have met good people. Thank you Hotel Balestier and keep up with your good service!

Only real gripe was with the bathroom, which was designed in such a way that everytime the shower is used, the entire bathroom would effectively be flooded.", "Date": "July 9, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Cosenza, Italy", "Title": "\u201cEverything Just Nice Hotel.\u201d", "Author": "Dimariofanco", "ReviewID": "UR114791836", "Content": "The hotel room is typically small like most hotel rooms in Singapore.

The room is relatively small but very clean and should really just serve you as a place to sleep and shower. The only slight problem i had were the thin walls meaning if you intend to sleep in, you may be interrupted by noises from the hallways (i.e. footsteps, doors closing, etc). The hotel is near Novena MRT which is possible to walk (15-20 mins at a leisurely pace) or you can hop on a bus that comes by every 15 mins to take you to the MRT (2 stops away). Though i personally would prefer if it was closer to the MRT station. There isn't a restaurant at the hotel but there are many hawker, food courts nearby and right next to the hotel is a 24 hour convenience mart.

They charged us for S$109 for a standard double room at the 4th floor but after seeing that the room did not have any windows we asked for one that had windows. Reception was very accommodating. They immediately transferred us to another room with a window but we had to pay another S$10.00 extra to get a room that had a view of the back street alley on the west side. Air conditioning was good so the hot afternoon sun did not really bother us. The following Monday they charged us for only S$99.00 plus S$10 extra for a room with a window. Front desk personnel were always smiling every time we talked to them and they were very helpful in getting directions. You can also rent the computers in the lobby to google for directions @ S$4.00 for half-hour use. Room is adequate for our needs with a queen-size bed that's quite comfortable, not too hard not too soft. We were able to doze off right away as there was no noise coming from the traffic outside. Hotel room door was quite secure. There's an LCD TV hanging right in front of the bed and bedside switches for the lights. There's no telephone charge for city calls. You can get an extra pillow for S$5.00. Bathrooms are average size although the whole bathroom floor can get wet as there are no shower curtains. No problem with the hot shower. Standard bathroom amenities are available. When we checked out on Tuesday morning the front desk staff agreed to have 2 medium sized luggages stored in their baggage room because we were going to Kuala Lumpur that evening minus the extra luggage. We picked it up at around 3AM Friday when we got back from KL and the front desk staff did not complain. By the way, there are 3 Value Hotels along Balestier Road in Singapore so you have to clearly inform the cab driver you want to go the Value Hotel on 218 Balestier Road otherwise you'll end up in VH-Thomson or VH Nice, both also on the same road. There are no coffee shops or restaurant facilities in the hotel so if you want to take breakfast there's a Chinese noodle house around the corner that opens at around 7AM or you can buy some snack foods and sandwiches at the 24-hour convenience store by the side entrance near the hotel lobby. Right across the hotel is a 7-11 store that's also open 24/7. The hotel provides 2 bottles of mineral water daily. There's a bus stop right in front of the hotel doorsteps so commuting to Orchard Road is only about 10 minutes ride and the bus to Vivo City in Harbour Front/ Sentosa is about 25 minutes away. There are several buses that stop every 10-15 minutes to take you to different routes. All routes are displayed in the bus stop.

The room was small, but it had all the basics such as tootbrushes, hair dryer, coffee maker etc. That's a great upgrade from no-frills hotel like Tune!

The first impression that learned from this hotel is clean and neat. The hotel staff taking care of their guess in a very professional manner, polite and helpful. It took me about 25 minutes from the airport to get to this hotel, the taxi cost about SGD $ 25, that if you pay with cash, but with the credit card there will be an additional 3% fees on top of your fare cost. The room sufficient enough for me since I travel alone, but if you bring family might be too small. The bathroom tiny as well, seems like trying to match it up with the size of the room, but everything very clean and neat... A bit noisy at the time I stay at this hotel...because there's a youth sports team stay there as well....the bed pretty comfy so that's a plus to it. In the morning I did asked the front desk if there's any bakery shop close by to get some bagel, bread or pastry...but they said unfortunately there's none closer to the area, so I was a bit disappointed, hopefully next time there will be one open near by the hotel. Overall my stay in Singapore was really good! thanks to the hospitality of Value Hotel Staff! I definitely stay again in this hotel for my next short trip to Singapore... If you have a little bit time to go out, Novena Squares Mall not too far away from this hotel, it takes about 5 minutes with the taxi and cost for about SGD $ 5. and If you in Novena Squares Mall try to stop by at KOPITIAM I think it means \"Coffee Time\" A lot of variety of food from Korean, Chinese and more! Price is good somewhere between SGD $ 5 and up.... I walk around the mall area...pretty nice lay out....a lot of apparel and fashion shop, book store, shoes and much more.....

Some of the reviews pointed that the hotel staff were less friendly but I staunchly disagree as the hotel staff were very friendly though out the stay. We reached the hotel by 8.00 am and the published check in time was 2.00pm. However, the hotel staff alloted the room and we checked in early with out any problem. The rooms were tidy and the house keeping staff ensured the room remained that way through out our stay. The hotel entrance opens to the main road and bus stop and in Singapore if your hotel is located to MRT or bus stop you can be rest assured that your stay would be that much more plesant. Taxis are easily available from and to the hotel. On the negative side, the rooms and bathrooms are very small. However, since we only stayed in the room during the nights, this did NOT matter. The hotel has no room service but Singapore has lot of eatries that are open 24 hours so even this did not matter. The hotel entrance has a 7-11 store that is also open 24 hours. Opposite to the hotel there are a couple of restaturants that are open till early hours. There is also a good spa bang opposite to the hotel.

It is located on Balestier road, on the opposite end to Value Hotel Balestier. Our taxi driver took us to the wrong hotel by mistake, as they were both located on Balestier road. We went to check-in and was told by the hotel staff we were in the wrong hotel, however they have rooms available as they opened only 2 weeks ago. The gentleman at the front desk was very helpful and showed us around the hotel and the room we could stay at. We were given a room on the 11th floor with a WINDOW!!! We decided to stay at this hotel as we couldn't be bother to get another cab, so he called Value Hotel Balestier to cancel our reservation there. The rooms are small, but has all the facilities one needs. The bathroom takes a bit of getting us to, as it was a walk in wet room (ie. toilet, wash hand basin and shower all in one space) Being a new hotel, everything was nice and clean...they even have a swimming pool and gym facilities, which the other one didn't. The best thing about this hotel, besides being relatively cheap for staying in Singapore was that the transport facilities were brilliant. The bus stop was right outside the hotel and which took us to the city centre. Also the staff were amazing friendly and helpful.", "Date": "July 20, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "3", "Location": "2", "Rooms": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "Italy", "Title": "\u201cBad Experience\u201d", "Author": "DLIT", "ReviewID": "UR33139487", "Content": "We stayed at Value Hotel Balestier for 5 (sleepless) nights. We know Singapore quite well and we are perfectly aware of the prices of a basic accommodation with a decent bathroom in a serviced area.

The walls in this place are so thin that you can hear word by word what the people next room says and we could hear all nights \"the ladies at work\". One night we went downstair to find girls hanging around. Not that I really bother about it, but I bother not to sleep because of it. Said that the room was even smaller than average in Singapore (!!!?!!) with the window locked but very clean with bedsheets and towels changed daily. The location is far from the turistic area but it's nice to walk around to see the real Singapore sometime. A short bus ride can get you nearly everywhere.

We liked that the bus stop is a few steps from the lobby and that they only accept overnight guests. There's a convenience store just outside so you can grab something to eat quickly if you're hungry. The room itself is a bit on the small side but manageable. A comfy queen size bed with very nice white sheets takes up most of the bedroom. There's no closet for your clothes nor a mini-ref. There's a long tiled area/bench (the span of 1 wall) where you can put your trolley/bags so it will be at chair height. The bathroom is square in size with toilet and shower area close together. There's strong water pressure with hot water so I didn't mind that it was on the smallish side. The bedsheets and towels are changed everyday. We had it done while we were out and we never lost any of our stuff, so kudos to the cleaning team. Only reason I didn't put 5 smileys for cleanliness was because I noticed they didn't sweep the floor the whole time we were there. There were dust bunnies around the bed. Also, there's a distinct smell in the hallway, like its unventilated. The room uses keycard system so A/C was attached to that. Just ask for another key so even if you go separate destinations you won't need to worry about getting in. Location wise its around Novena/Lavander area. You need to take the bus to go to Orchard. Its actually better to take the bus to go to the city rather than look for the nearest mrt station. Travel time is around 20 mins. Don't forget to try the chicken rice at Wee Nam Kee which is just in front of the Catholic Church on Novena. Just ask the reception how to get there. They had a welcoming reception service. We had some take away food and wanted to have it heated and the receptionist there reheated it for us immediately. =D Overall, for the price and the convenience, I would stay there again.", "Date": "March 25, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "3", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "London", "Title": "\u201cNew, clean, basic\u201d", "Author": "StChristopherUK", "ReviewID": "UR25910507", "Content": "This is a very new (or completely refurbished) hotel so everything looked nice and smelled fresh.

It's been 3 restless nights despite that we are dead tiring after the daytime activities. 2ndly, the floor was never clean, i assumed... as i see dirt & dust on the floor and underneath the bed.
