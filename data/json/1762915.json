It is connected to the Indianapolis Convention Center, a large downtown mall, lots of restaurants, and other major buidlings downtown via a skywalk system. The only real downside is parking. The JW Marriott shares an underground parking garage with three other connected Marriott properties (a Courtyard, a Fairfield Inn, and a Springhill Suites). Each feeds into the same three level garage using different elevator banks, but guests at each are competing for the same spots. Much of the garage is taken up by \"valet only\" spaces. The weekend I was in town for the Big 10 tournament, the self-parking spaces frequently were full, leaving no choice but to pay for $40 a night valet parking or else park across the street in a public parking garage.

The location was terrific, in terms of proximity to the convention center and downtown activites (you can take the enclosed skywalk from the hotel to the convention center across the street and for several bocks to access the downtown eateries, pubs, shopping, etc. in inclement weather). Upon entering the lobby, one of the reservation staff who wait in front for arriving guests, greeted us warmly and escorted us to an individual tall granite carrel to sign us in. She was friendly and engaging, minimizing the process, which took perhaps three minutes. She then personally led us to the elevators and explained that our key card must be inserted once inside to enable access to upper floors when ascending to our room. From our room on the 19th floor (facing downtown) we enjoyed a wonderful perspective of downtown and Lucas Oil Stadium from the floor to ceiling windows. At night, we left the drapes open to view beautiful cityscape lights. Our room was spacious, appointed with beautiful, high quality furnishings. And the bed. . . . . Ah yes, the bed. Wow. I love my bed at home; spent a lot of money to get it just right, but the hotel bed was to die for. We slept like babies! This hotel is new, with nearly every amenity you might wish for, and what you'd expect from lodging of this caliber and expense. Guest services staff were quite helpful the three times I needed them (1. the programmable room safe needed a new battery - and security and maintenance were there within minutes, 2. We needed the room a bit cooler, but there was a limiter on the thermostat. Again, maintenance arrived and enabled cooler temps within 7 minutes, 3. I couldn't figure out the coffee maker - embarrassing, I know - and they quickly explained how the new fancy models worked without making me feel like an idiot). The main restaurant, Osteria Pronto (Italian), is where we chose to eat breakfast a couple of mornings. A bit expensive, but food quality and selection were excellent, including the breakfast buffet. We hope to stay here again next year.

It was my first time in Indianapolis. Was really impressed by the size of the place - it's absolutely huge - you could probably spend a whole day walking around it (the place even has its own Starbucks!) As it's fairly new, everything was in pristine condition and my room was finished to a really high standard. I had a corner room, pretty high up, which had floor-to-ceiling windows along two sides. This meant fantastic views in the day (wow, Indianapolis is flat!) and the views at night were gorgeous. As it was a corner room the room was big and had more than enough space for me. The bed was really comfy and everything was absolutely spotless. The only thing I disliked was the air con. It was like there was only 3 settings: cold, more cold or off. It was a bit frustrating not to be able to control the temperature yourself. Also, had a bit of an issue not being able to connect to the room WiFi (but this could've been because of the conference going on). Anyway, I reported it, it was resolved quickly and I was given 24 hours complimentary service, so I was quite impressed by that. Check-in was fast (considering the amount of people they were attending the conference) and service was spot-on.

A real Starbucks, not a \"we serve Starbucks.\" There are two restaraunts in the hotel. I didn't eat at the Italian place but it looked rather pricey. The sports bar was very upscale and had a good selection of food and drinks, at about regular pricing. The food there was pretty good. If you have a chance to upgrade to an executive room or get upgraded, you will want to check out the Lounge on the 31st floor. They have snacks out all day, breakfast in the mornings, sodas and waters in refrigerators all day and beer/wine for purchase in the evenings. Plenty of TV's and couches for relaxing. Very comfortable for unwinding. Hotel is centrally located and connected via skywalk to the convention center and other hotels. There is a mall in walking distance as well as numerous other restaraunts at all price levels. They do have a gym and indoor pool. Gym had ellipticals, treadmills, machine weights and some free weights. Was health club quality for sure. And they have chilled wet towels for cooling off, if one might need that in Indianapolis in the winter. In closing, this was perhaps the best hotel I have ever stayed at. Very clean, very upscale.

The Osteria Pronto restaurant was extremely good, so good in fact that my wife and I ate there a couple of times.

A large (32\u2019?) flat screen, high def TV was there. The bathroom was pretty small, a table for a basin area, the commode, and a standup shower.

The JW Marriott was the nicest, but it lacked a few things that I enjoy. I knew this going in, so I can't really mark them down for that. Parking: Self-parking is $28, and the garage is underground. Access this on Washington Street, just past the entrance to the SpringHill Suites. All three connecting hotels use this same garage. Get ticket upon entrance and bring it with you to check-in, where your key will be programmed to allow you to exit the garage. Don't forget to do this, as there are no parking attendants at the exit. While the garage is color-coded based on the hotel in which you are staying, there is no reason why you have to park in your designated color if there is no room available. The additional walk from a different colored area will be about 2 minutes. We had to drive around the garage twice to find an open spot that was not designated for valet parking, which was only about 50% full. Check-In: This took less than 10 minutes even though there was a line. Elevators: Some people don't like the key card access for the elevators, but I am a fan of this for safety reasons. No one can get past the second floor without a key unless they are with a hotel guest. Lobby: Beautiful and plenty of seating. Restaurants are on this level. Starbucks is on second floor near the entrance to the skywalk that leads to a parking structure and the Indianapolis Convention Center. Sadly, Starbucks was closed at 6:30 pm on a Saturday evening. Room: We had a \"park view\" room that was beautiful. The floor to ceiling windows are great. The room was a decent size (2 queens) and very clean. There was a desk chair and high back chair but no sofa for guest seating. The neighboring SpringHill Suites includes a separate seating area, which is nice for larger groups. On the other hand, large groups could just use the beautiful lobby at the JW. There are no refrigerators or microwaves. The bathroom was a good size, nice layout and very clean. We were in a room next to the stairs, and the people going up/down were very, very loud. This is not the fault of the hotel, but check your room location if this will bother you in the middle of the night. Dining: Room service took over an hour, but we were not in a hurry. The weekend breakfast/brunch at Osteria Pronto was excellent. I enjoyed that it was served until 1 pm on weekends, allowing us to have a leisurely morning. We checked out, stored bags, and had breakfast at noon. The food was great, but even better was the staff. From the waitress to the omelette cook to the person clearing tables, everyone was so friendly and efficient. Other: The hotel is within walking distane to just about everything - Lucas Oil Stadium, Convention Center, City Centre Mall, etc. While it would be cold in the winter, there are a good number of skywalks connecting things in this city. Cons: I got an excellent rate for this hotel, but it did not include a fridge, microwave, breakfast, parking, sitting area or internet ($12.95). The SpringHill Suites, next door, while not as elegant included all of these things for the same price (minus parking). That hotel is connected to this one, so the skywalks, restaurants, pool, Starbucks and nice lobby can be used by anyone. I knew all of this when making my reservation, so I won't complain about it. I just want readers to think about this when making a reservation. There is a spot for a fridge within the hotel room itself, but you have to request that one be brought up. I'm not sure if this would cost extra. The internet charge is ridiculous when it's free next door. The breakfast was excellent, so book a room with a breakfast package if possible. Parking is typical for a big city. Just keep all of this in mind when choosing a rate for the room. You'll pay at least an additional $75 if you want breakfast in a JW restaurant, parking and internet.

The hotel has been open since February 2011. The remarkable experience about staying at the JW Marriott was the fact that virtually every employee that I interacted with greeted me or offered to provide assistance in some way. The staff goes out of its way to make guests feel welcome, to the point that the reception desk personnel stand in front of their desks to greet arriving guests. I arrived at 3 PM and was checked in within a matter of minutes. I opted to self-park my car in the below ground parking garage, and the self-park fee was $23/day.

An easy chair and side table next to the desk left little space between the chair and the bed to navigate to the window and its great view. The room was clean and the beds comfortable.

It's also just blocks from Lucas Oil Stadium and across the street from Victory Field, the AAA baseball team's home in Indy. My only hiccup at the JW Marriott was that my room key would not open the parking gate on my departure.

We were in room 3101 and had a fantastic view. Tip: if you get this room, you will not be disappointed. The JW Indy is the tallest hotel in Indianapolis and depending upon which way you are facing, the views are incredible. We ate at High Velocity only and chose to walk to the many other restaurants in the area. The executive lounge is very nice on the 31st floor but my tip is to make sure that you don\u2019 t wait until breakfast is almost over to get there. The breakfast ended at 11am but by 10:45 or so, a lot of the food was gone. The staff there did make a special trip to replenish what was there but if you had an appointment to make, you would have been late. Pros: - Check-in: was a breeze. It was quick and came off without a hitch. - The convenience: This hotel is close to everything in downtown Indy. You can take the skywalk to the convention center and on down to the mall. You are in walking distance of several restaurants, Indiana State House, and the canal \u2013 where you can rent paddle boats. You do not need a car if you are staying downtown. - The rooms: very clean and nicely decorated and the bed was comfortable. The shower had 2 \u201cbody\u201d shower heads coming out of the wall in addition to the main one from above \u2013 nice touch! - The staff: was very nice and willing to go the extra mile if you needed anything. We ordered extra towels and did not have to wait long for them. - The food: we ate at High Velocity and the Executive lounge (for breakfast). Overall, the food was pretty good but I would recommend that you venture out \u2013 there is so much more to offer downtown. Executive \u201cbreakfast\u201d included scrambled eggs, sausage, bacon, a daily chef\u2019s special (biscuits and gravy), juice, muffins, lox and cream cheese bagels, etc. For more economic options, Friday\u2019s is located on the property just behind (west of) the hotel. Cons: - The rooms: they were a bit small and there was no refrigerator or safe. But I believe the smaller rooms are so that the hotel can accommodate for more rooms. Overall, I didn\u2019t feel cramped but I have stayed at Marriott\u2019s where the rooms were bigger. - Capacity to hold groups: My only other issue is whether this hotel has the full capacity to accommodate groups. My husband\u2019s fraternity had its centennial celebration in Indy last month. The JW Marriott was one of the host hotels. Unfortunately, it had to \u201cclose\u201d down the lobby and hotel because it was too crowded. The closing did pose a problem for some people downtown. I am quite sure the JW left a lot of money on the table that night! Nevertheless, if this was a problem then, I can\u2019t imagine how they will handle the Super bowl! - The Pool: is very small (approximately 25 ft long) and only about 4 \u00bd feet. - Executive Lounge: they ran out of food close to the end of breakfast. It also seemed like they let almost \u201canyone\u201d in there. I can see how someone could just \u201csneak\u201d in behind someone.

While this nice, new, clean JW is a cool addition to the Indy skyline, it comes nowhere near most JWs in terms of service, style, vibe, and clientele. If however you don't mind a massive 1000-plus room beehive, 45-minute or more wait for breakfast (for the buffet!), completely below par executive lounge on the Concierge level, and grating masses clamoring through the lobby, then this place is for you. We arrived at 8 pm with three large bags and two roll-a boards yet there was no bellman in sight nor did any staff offer to find one or welcome us. As we dragged our bags once more, this time down the long long hallway to our room, we noticed a piece of white paper folded into the door jam of most every room, including, finally, ours. Turned out to be a crassly worded edict to guests informing us that the hotel had several big events coming in the next morning, Sunday, so could we please be sure to be out by 11! What a welcome. Hello - now leave! Don't mind a gentle reminder, but as a Marriott Elite I have earned and am accustomed to flexible check out. This memo certainly could have been written less offensively, or not posted at all to certain rooms. Further with the wait for breakfast so long, as we learned the hard way the next morning, how on earth do they expect you to hustle out? Given the long and winding line for the brunch buffet, we checked out the concierge lounge on the 31st floor, which also serves breakfast. What a mess. Upon arrival - they were out of coffee. Dirty dishes, leftovers scattered all over the room. The buffet/serve-yourself area was filthy - as was every piece of purportedly clean silverware. We finally assembled some plates and utensils, (which we had to wipe down) only to open the lid of the \"scrambled eggs\" buffet dish and learn that was empty too. Server said several times they were on the way with more, but no eggs ever arrived. We cobbled together sort of a fake lox and bagels out of what remained of the sliced salmon, left over low fat cream cheese - the regular was gone - and a piece of wheat bread, as only one bagel - raisin- remained in the bin. The pastry selection was better, but they did not taste fresh. Later, trying to make a cup of hot tea, we were greeted with no hot water. Finally got the water from a server who went to the kitchen for us, but as we went back to the tea/coffee set up we found there were no creamers or stirrers. Asked for a stirrer, a server digs one out of the back of a cabinet and hands it to us, unwrapped with his bare hands. All in all atrocious. This is a herd 'em in, herd 'em out convention hotel and nothing more. Maybe a nice addition for this city and convenient to The Colts and Indy 500, but if you are looking for fine service, class and luxury, this is not it.

We have had the opportunity to stay at most of the downtown hotels including the Conrad, the Westin, the Marriott, and the Hyatt, and I can truly say that in our short stay at the JW Marriott, they have made us customers for life! First of all, the building itself is a knock-out \u2013 contemporary and sleek...a beautiful addition to the Indianapolis skyline. The lobby was bustling with activity at all hours, and although we didn\u2019t have the chance to visit any of the restaurants, they looked very inviting - especially the lobby bar which had plenty of cozy areas for drinks and conversation. The design is one in which there is no congestion. Even though there were many people passing through, the flow of traffic was smooth...just one more indication of the many details that have gone into designing this hotel. Although it was quite busy when we checked in around 8:00 pm, we had no wait. All the check-in desks were busy, but as soon as we stepped into the waiting area, a gentleman who had been observing the lobby area came to greet us and take us to another check-in station. We appreciated his attentiveness, but were even more impressed with his personalized service. We were informed that as Marriott Reward members, we had been upgraded to one of the higher floor rooms, and believe me, the view is incredible! When he asked the purpose of our visit, we explained that we were celebrating our daughter\u2019s 21st birthday. He immediately focused on her, wishing her a happy birthday and giving her the \u201croyal treatment.\u201d He then proceeded to ask her if she had a favorite wine, as he wished to send up a complimentary bottle in honor of her special day. What a thoughtful touch!

We normally stay at the Conrad what visiting Indy but decided to try out the new hotel. The hotel is over-sized - probably 5X the size of the Conrad. Almost reminds one of a Vegas-style hotel. The styling of the hotel is very modern/eclectic - it stands in sharp contrast to the more conservative and traditional Conrad styling. I personally prefer the Conrad but I'm sure others will prefer the JW. The JW lobby is loud and busy - Conrad is quiet and reserved. The service was generally pretty good - however, the luggage did take over 30 minutes to get to the room. I finally went down stairs to retrieve the luggage at which point the bell man brought it up. We did not order room service or eat at the restaurants so we got little exposure to the service other than the valet, which was fine. The room view was spectacular. We were on the top floor and had an end room - two walls with floor to ceiling glass. Amazing. This is one area that the Conrad can not complete with JW - the views. Otherwise, the room was like the lobby - more modern in design. The office chair looks like something from my parents 70's kitchen. Take note: the bathroom does NOT have a tub - least not in our room. Also, the room did not have a couch (which you get at the Conrad) although there is room for one. But overall the room was very nice, beds were comfortable. The pool is very small - smaller than Conrad and I do not like the \"raised\" design of the pool. Hot tub was nice sized and the excerise facility was very large. One area where the Conrad is obviously superior to the JW is the changing/shower facilities for the pools and excercise rooms. There is no comparison. Conrad feels like an exclusive golf club with dry/wet sauna, multiple showers, many free amenities etc. The JW feels like a public changing area with no saunas and few free amenities. The Conrad comes equipped with robes and they are nowhere in sight at the JW. The presence of a Starbucks in the meetings area is a nice feature. Overall, the new JW is a great new hotel in Indy but my vote is still that Conrad is a distant first. If you are an executive used to high-end treatment, it's my opinion the JW probably will not quite satisfy like the Conrad.", "Date": "July 27, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Aeowyn98", "Title": "\u201cPerfect Stay\u201d", "Author": "Aeowyn98", "ReviewID": "UR115668283", "Content": "This new hotel in Indianapolis by far exceeded my expectations.

So believe me when I say this hotel is great! Thanks to a TA post, we parked across the street for $15/night available on weekends only ($28/night self park at the JW and ~$30/night valet). The hotel is well located and close to almost everything ($5 cab ride in the city if the walk is too long). There was a lot going on at the hotel (and downtown in general) this particular weekend when we checked in (wedding party, Seger concert, pay per view fight at High Velocity, prom) and the lobby was packed. However, we were greeted promptly and lead to a podium to check in without delay and even had a choice of rooms (king on 4th floor or 2 queen beds on 20th with city view). Brett was pleasant and helpful, but not too intrusive. After a quick check in, he walked us to our elevator while answering any questions and pointing out things about the hotel. He made sure the key worked in the elevator (very nice touch) and sent us on our way. The room was spacious, very clean and welcoming. There was nothing to complain about, but we did find it curious that we didn't have a mini-bar. That being said, there was a coffee maker with an assortment of teas, coffee, creamer and so forth, and 2 bottles of complimentary water. The view was amazing! (thanks again TA members!) We had a very pleasant meal at High Velocity (thanks to Emily) which is located right off the lobby then enjoyed a walk outside, a quick nap in those amazing beds, then grabbed a $5 cab ride to Conseco Fieldhouse for the concert. Again, this was a very busy weekend, but the doormen/valet were courteous and patient with everyone. Once back, we checked out the lobby (which was packed!) and crawled upstairs and back to those great beds! We hit the fitness center early and were very impressed! The equipment was top notch and plentiful, along with towels, water, and an assistant if needed. A bill for our stay had been placed under our door during the night and we thoroughly checked it for any excessive charges (sales and occupancy taxes only). Check-out was even easier than check-in, and we were on our way. I would recommend this hotel to everyone. There is so much to do within walking distance (minor league baseball, museums, river walk, NCAA headquarters, capital building, .....) and such a nice hotel to stay in while touring this great city.", "Date": "May 9, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Grand Rapids, Michigan", "Title": "\u201cVery Nice but something was just a little Off\u201d", "Author": "arubachristene", "ReviewID": "UR106012576", "Content": "My husband and I live in Indianapolis and were attending a gala downtown. It was being held at the hotel and we decided to make it a real date night and spend the night. Our first impression of the hotel was not so great - the valets were very friendly when we first pulled up. My husband wanted to stop the car for a moment to unload our bags. When we told them we wanted to self-park they were a bit rude about it. I was already out of the car with my bags when we were told we needed to go park in the garage (30 minutes of self-park is free). It was awkward and embarrassing. Once they knew we wanted to self park they just seemed to look right past us, even when my husband had a question... Once we parked and got inside things got a lot better. The lobby was beautiful and the woman that checked us in was fantastic! Very warm and friendly. I peeked into the \"Velocity\" bar, excited at first from seeing it on the website, but then realized it was too 'sports bar' for me - no cozy or comfy seating that I saw. We were lucky to get a room on a high floor. The room was very nice with windows ceiling to floor which I loved. The beds were super comfy - we slept great which is probably one of the most important things. The room was nicely decorated but didn't seem to have as much personality as some of the other JWs I've stayed at. And one weird thing - no light in the closet. While I guess you don't 'need' a light in the closet, that was one thing that struck us as strange. Bathroom set-up was a little weird too -- no bathtub but a big shower with extra jets. That was awesome but being a date night I would have liked the bath. And the bathroom door opened in a way that it blocks the shower door. (I'm weird - I like the door open if I'm just showering or getting ready since bathrooms can seem a little claustrophobic.) Then like most hotels they want you to save your towels, but don't give adequate towel racks (just the one on the shower door and a robe hook). Not that it mattered - we were just staying one night. None of these things were a big deal but made this hotel feel a little unfinished - like a few corners were cut or there were a few oversights. The lobby bar was nice and we did grab a cocktail. I think it was called Ginger Crush? It was great (muddled strawberries in it) but really sweet. And the rest of the cocktail menu needs help. Even the waitress gave us kind of a 'ya, I know' as we were sitting there a little lost while we read it. One of my favorite things about a nice bar is getting to try fun cocktails. I can't tell if it lacks imagination or of someone was trying to hard to be imaginative. After our gala we tried two other drinks there that were just weird. We ended up ordering late night room service - fish and chips, that were really good. Then we had room service again for breakfast which was ok. I had a wrap that was great but the potatoes it came with were soggy. That's ok - I didn't need to eat much after the late night service. =) Overall I would definitely recommend this hotel. Probably the best in Indy but doesn't compare with the JW (as I remember it) in San Francisco. Somehow I think even our JW here in Grand Rapids, MI is more chic.

The package included valet parking ($32), 4-course dinner at the hotel's Italian bistro, a high-floor room with a view, champagne, and chocolate covered strawberries. Any of the grievances I had likely related to the fact that the hotel had only been open for 8 days - i.e. slow service, popularity - but the staff made a significant effort to make things right. For example, Because of the popularity of the package and the hype of the new restaurant, reservations booked up without us even knowing. The hotel called us to suggest we book the 9:00p time slot (one of the few left) - which I was upset about because I don't like eating dinner that late. After expressing my disappoint, the hotel offered us complimentary in-room breakfast the next morning and a 2p late checkout. (Used sugar, not vinegar). Other frustrations included waiting 50 minutes for a second robe and waiting 20 minutes the next morning for toast missing from our order. Again, new hotel, new staff - forgivable. The food was very good. Osteria Pronto was elegant but not stuffy. We had a small issue with the waiter keeping our change as tip - which was uncouth- but it seemed to work out in the end. We were annoyed that we had to pay the tax and gratuity since the dinner was \"included\" in our package. They had a large selection of wines, but a small selection of ones that could be purchased by the glass or carafe. The prosecco was delicious. The food was plentiful - even for four-courses - and very good. My salmon was excellent, however the potatoes accompanying it were undercooked. Not a deal breaker though. I wouldn't visit the restaurant again unless I was staying at the hotel. In room dining (breakfast) was also elegant and plentiful. We both ordered the steak and eggs. My eggs weren't cooked right (how many people order \"over hard\"), but the steaks were cooked perfectly medium. Mine had an interesting \"carbon\" taste to the char, but I ate it nonetheless. Huge NY strip, too. The room was plush, modern, and romantic. The sheets were comfortable and the bed was soft. The decor is bright, modern, and a little funky but still elegant. The floor to ceiling windows are not for the faint at heart, but the views of downtown from floor 28 are stunning. The bathroom was also very nice. I was pleasantly surprised to find a spacious (room for 2!) shower with two extra shower heads. We felt extremely comfortable and at home in the room. The pool is small - no doubt - but the jacuzzi is a nice size. Parents seemed to apologize for the children often, but this was not so much the kids fault as it was the size of the pool. The location is phenomenal. The hotel is within walking distance to Monument Circle (please visit Giorgio's Pizza on the circle - classic, low key italian dining) and Circle Center Mall - less than 10 min walking. The hotel is also a short walking distance from White River State Park which has quiet paths that lead to the zoo, Indiana State Museum, and other museums and places of interest. Even on a mild winter day, it was a pleasure to stroll through the park.

The Gentleman at the check in desk was also very helpful getting us a speedy check in then escorting my family and me to the elevator (nice touch). Our room was located on the 30th floor. The floor to ceiling windows enhanced a fantastic view of the city. As one would expect on a hotel's opening weekend, the room was spotless. The room has nice modern furniture and the bed's were comfortable. For Marriott rewards members, the Executive Lounge was extremely nice - one of the best I've seen. The hotel offers an indoor pool (kind of small) and a very nice fitness area. We did eat at the Velocity Sports Bar in the hotel. It was a nice casual restaurant with good food. One exception was my wife's steak which was way undercooked, but the waitress made it right and took it off our bill (without us even asking). I can't overstate how good the service was here. They certainly had plenty of staff on hand to help with every need possible. It was certainly a great opening weekend and I look forward to staying there again in the future.", "Date": "February 8, 2011"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "JW Marriott Indianapolis", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g37209-d1762915-Reviews-JW_Marriott_Indianapolis-Indianapolis_Indiana.html", "Price": "$198 - $420*", "Address": "<address> <span rel=\"v:address\"> <span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">10 South West Street</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:locality\">Indianapolis</span>, <span property=\"v:region\">IN</span> <span property=\"v:postal-code\">46204</span></span> </span> </span> </address>", "HotelID": "1762915", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/01/f1/50/b0/jw-marriott-indianapolis.jpg"}}
