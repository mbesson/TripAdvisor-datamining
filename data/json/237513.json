A nice desk clerk recommended two amazing restaurants and places to go out at night after. The guy really went out of his way for us letting us use his computer at the front desk to check internet. Then another staff member was so worried we wouldnt get a message from a friend she kept checking to see if we were back until we got it. They were all so nice. While the second floor of a walk up and a shower over the toilet may not be ideal for many older travelers, the price plus the service made it just perfect for us.

We think it was just converted to an apt from possibly being a shop of some sort. The entrance was all glass with an awning, like a store, but they had big curtains to give you privacy. It was so far into the courtyard, nobody came by anyways. We don't think all the renovation work was completed as some stuff seemed unusual, like machinery in the corner and odd chemicals under the sinks. However it was huge! It was very clean!! It was extremely private and quiet!! It had a living room with sofa bed and a big bedroom, kitchen and bathroom. The oven wasn't working yet. The fridge was the biggest I saw in Italy. We really enjoyed it. The breakfast at the hotel was better than most in Italy. Croissants, cereal, fruit, juice, bread, and cakes. The staff was very helpful.

The beds were comfy, the bathroom was as others described with a shower not enclosed by anything but a curtain - BUT - the water pressure was good and the water nice and HOT - can be difficult to find in budget hotels. Breakfast was good, although after 5 days, I was looking for a little more variety - maybe a banana or cheese here and there - not really a big issue though. The staff arranged to have a cab meet us at the crack of dawn (6am) to go to the airport and thankfully it was there with time to spare. The location was fantastic - we were two women alone and did not feel unsafe once, even late at night. There is apparently a good restaurant across the street, but it didn't look like it would fit our budget, so I didn't try it - it seemed very popular with locals though.

On our 2 week trip to Italy, this was probably the best place we stayed. I liked it so much I recommended it to my sister and she stayed too (and loved it). I should mention that we were on a tight budget, but we ddi stay at 3-4 other places at around 80-120 Euro/night and this was the most for the money.Location:Superb. Not right in teh heart of the city center (ie, Duomo), but only about a 10 minute walk. Its actually close to the Accademia (David) and not far from Uffizi, either. Plus, it gets you to side of town you might not otehrwise go to. Tucked into an alley way with a real Italian neighborhood feel--it really worked for us!Staff:some of teh most pleasant people we met. it wasnt crowded when we were there so we got the royal treatment--like a personal concigere. breakfast was great tooRooms:Now this was probably the only place I stayed with AC the whole time and it was great. Much better than a hostle. we had no issues with the AC working, although I do not recall a control unit in teh room. The bed was fine...no real memory of it though.

I picked the hotels we stayed in and my criteria were that they had to be within walking distance of the main sights, have air conditioning, and be reasoonably priced. I knew it would be hot and Italy and I knew that air conditioning was uncommon and would cost extra. I was willing to pay extra for it and based on these criteria, I picked Chiazza for our stay in Florence. Although almost all the hotels we stayed in turned out to be great, Chiazza was a disaster.I had never been to Florence before and was worried about choosing a place that would be too far to walk to the city center. I don't like taking buses, even in the states, so I didn't want to have to use them in Italy, nor did I want the cost or hastle of using taxis. Chiazza's location was excellent, close enough to everything that it was a short walk, but not so close that you hear noisy carousing outside your window. I can't complain about the location except to say that I needn't have worried so much about being that close to the city center-- we could have stayed farther away and still been within a reasonable walking distance.The air-conditioning, which I viewed as essential when selecting our hotels, did not work at any point during our stay, nor did the staff seem to find this unusual or make any great effort to fix it. In fact, they claimed they HAD turned it on, despite the fact that the room did not get any cooler. We ultimately had to resort to opening the windows. That would have been fine, if it had actually cooled the room (it did a little, but not to the point of being comfortable). Worse, though, was when I started hearing the mosquitos buzzing about our room as I attempted to sleep. Having been compelled to open the windows to cool the room off, we now had to contend with mosquitos. I didn't realize I needed to bring mosquito nets on a trip to Florence. I hate mosquitos. I really, really hate them. Trying to sleep in the sticky summer heat was one thing, but it was impossible to get any proper sleep while I listened to the mosquitos buzz around our room. In retrospect, I probably should have gone to an Internet cafe and found us another hotel in Florence. The possibility of doing that did not occur to me at the time, though.There are probably people reading this who think I am making a big deal over nothing. For some people, air-conditoning is just a luxury and mosquitos might be annoying but aren't a big deal. But it was a big deal for me and I chose this hotel over other cheaper hotels because it had air-conditioning and because I wouldn't have to worry about spending the night being devoured by bloodthirsty insects. I paid extra for that and didn't get what I paid for.So, if you don't care about air-conditioning, I would recommend choosing one of the many cheaper hotels in Florence that don't have air-conditioning. If you do want air-conditioing, then you should pick a different hotel, which might cost more but will actually give you what you want. The only person this hotel would appeal to might be a gambler-- who wants to pay extra on the off chance that they might be luckier than we were.", "Date": "Sep 11, 2006", "ReviewID": "UR862158494", "Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Business service": "1", "Cleanliness": "2", "Check in / front desk": "1", "Overall": "1", "Value": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "idomeneus"}, {"Content": "Great hotel for the location and price I was really happy with this hotel.

For a budget option, it didn't feel particularly unsafe or dirty. It's fairly unattractive on the inside (ugly bedspreads, puke-colored floors) and up several long flights of stairs when dragging luggage, but I more or less expected this for the price we paid. It was fairly quiet at night.Absolutely unacceptable is the fact that we chose it because it advertised air conditioning, and it emphatically did not have air conditioning. There was a bit of a run-around on the first night we got there about it, with one of the girls at the front desk mentioning something about having to ask the day manager. They claimed they turned it on, but our room never got one jot cooler. This might have been all right, since it was only the beginning of June, but the windows lacked screens. When we opened the windows in absolute desperation for some air, we were visited by every insect in Florence.Other problems: the breakfast was standard Italian fare, which would have been fine if the milk products had been properly refrigerated. The staff was indeed multilingual, but not particularly helpful. The shower is one of those European deals, with a shower head on the side of the wall and no stall. (Not a big deal if you're expecting it, but we weren't.)When we checked in after getting off a very delayed train, we learned that if we'd been just a few minutes later, the hotel would have closed, locking us out without accommodations for our first night in Florence. Be sure to arrive before midnight if you don't want this to happen to you.I used to edit budget Italian travel guides, and believe me when I tell you that there are better budget options out there, even in Florence.
