The hotel charges 15 euro for this and is not worth it. I would go down the street and eat at the various local cafes etc to which you would have a larger selection and also better quality. The bread was stale, the fruit juice out of a machine came with its own frothy top, coffee (again out of a machine) tasted off and the mikl sour. My partner and I got there just before 7 one morning and was told by an abrupt waitress that breakfast was at 7, to which she slammed the door in our face !!!. Also breakfast time appears to be when the staff also have there breakfast and can be seen standing in a row eating theirs in the kitchen!!!! - Not sure if this is a good or bad thing??? Otherwise a very pleasant stay, basic, clean, but do not go B&B waste of your money. A cafe/bakery serving bacon eggs/cakes/crepes etc - head towards Las Ramblas and it is on your left side, with a small sandwich shop (takeaway) (same company) opposite on your right side .

Can you imagine if you were quite elderly you just could not do it. The breakfast is terrible, diluted orange quash as all of the 3 juices are. You have a choice of a slice of cheese and ham or a hard boiled egg. The toast is a DIY job which caused a big que. The staff at breakfast are most unhelpful and are ignorant not verging on it. Do not go to this hotel unless you demand a room that looks out on the road were the entrance is which is a very noisey shopping area, but at least no one can walk accross a flat roof into your room via the bebroom window, better still just refuse to go to it.

The hotel itself looks really nice in the lobby area. However, the rooms are a little different. My girlfriend and i were not expecting much from, but firstly we got put in a twin room and after we called reception we were moved to a room which was half the size of the twin room and right next to the elevator. A good thing is that you do not really get too much elevator noise, but you can sometimes hear rowdy guests. My biggest problem with the room was that there was no natural light, so with the lights turned off at midday it still looks and feels like midnight. I think my body clock was quite confused the 3 nights we spent in that room. Other than that the room was quite clean and the bathroom quite respectable in size and cleanliness. One major downside at the hotel would definitely be the service. To start with housekeeping, although they do a good job with the rooms they walked in on my girlfriend and i twice in the space of 30 minutes on the day we were meant to check out... and it was still 2 hours till check out. In fairness it appears someone turned our DND sign around so the housekeeper would have thought the room was empty, but you would think after the first one walked in she would have turned the sign back around. The second lady that walked in looked like she was the angry one and took the sign off the door and was showing us... my girlfriend and i just stared at her since we were still in bed. Down at front desk service seems really slow and half willed. There is generally 1 person at front desk and quite a few guests. Someone that appeared to be of a supervisor role was always there sitting at a desk and does not appear to want to help front desk team, unless there are dire circumstances. I expected more, especially when the service we received in the restaurants in the local area and in shops were second to none. The hotel is located in an amazing area. Right around the corner from La Rambla and on a street of many restaurants and shops. My mouth watered every time i walked along the street at how amazing all the food looks in the restaurants and gelaterias. Very close was the marina and the mercado where you just need to go for breakfast! The pizza slice there are so amazing and enormous! Barcelona is an amazing city and the location of the hotel is in the more gothic part of the city meaning you have this amazing architecture at your doorstep. Would i return to the hotel?

The hotel is perfectly located to explore the city, being very close to the main Ramblas, meaning you can access many restaurants and sights easily. We were staying in a room on the fifth floor, which was fine, however the fan did not seem to work and so was sweltering hot (even though it wasn\u2019t that hot outside) this seemed to be a problem with the other rooms in the area as they all had their windows open. Furthermore, we faced onto a back courtyard, which was not good. The room itself was small, but comfortable, with a modern bathroom (although the shower was not the best and the floor was very slippery causing a hazard) and nicely decorated. However a very large group of students moved in and were there on the last two nights of our stay, who made an unbelievable amount of noise throughout the whole night and very early in the morning. We complained several times to the hotel reception, who did not take our concerns seriously and did nothing about the noise resulting in two nights with no sleep. This was very disappointing, spoilt the trip and severely reduced our opinion of the hotel as we would expect the hotel to act on our concerns. We are a young couple who do not like to complain about noise or the condition of the hotel, however on this occasion we were shocked that the hotel staff did nothing to stop the noise leaving us feeling that they were unhelpful and not concerned with our complaint. Our experience of Barcelona itself, aside from the hotel was very good. We paid for the room only rather than breakfast and I am glad we did, with many places to eat both on the Ramblas and the street the hotel is located on (we ate breakfast at one particular place each day, which was very reasonable). We also found a small restaurant just opposite the hotel, selling pizza and a drink for around 8 euros, which was very good considering Barcelona was an expensive city to eat out. A tip for sightseeing is to use to Barcelona Tourist Buses which run from the nearby Plaza Catalunya and are an excellent way to see the sights of the city, with three different routes to choose from or you can do all of them. Overall we had a lovely break in Barcelona, however we would not stay in the same hotel again as although excellently located, there are many hotels in the Ramblas area to choose from, which are likely to offer higher levels of service looking after their customers and for a similar budget.", "Date": "March 4, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Stockport", "Title": "\u201cExcellent Hotel!\u201d", "Author": "evelyn_speak", "ReviewID": "UR56681830", "Content": "Stayed for 5 nights while exploring Barcelona.

But they changed it (thank God!) next morning and moved our stuff. The second room was better, but it's annoying that they cannot fix small things - like smell in the bathroom or showerheads (the bathrooms are all newly renovated, they look amazing, but when you take a shower the whole bachroom will be wet, including ceiling).

For its location the hotel is very reasonable priced, and for its price it looks surprisingly good. We also recommend that you go to cafe Rodrigo, just next to St Maria Del Mar cathedral.

However, the fact that the hotel advertises it has Wi-fi access is a complete joke! There is hotspot somewhere OUTSIDE the lobby run by the local phone company Telefonica, which gives a strong signal in the downstairs lounge, but neither I nor anybody in my party could get it to work! Given that this THREE STAR hotel ADVERTISES that wi-fi available this is really very shabby indeed! I spoke to the receptionist and he just shrugged his shoulders and said it usually works! As the hotel clearly has a cable or ADSL internet connection (there is a crappy 2-euro per 10 minutes internet \"console\" in the lounge) they could easily provide a proper, self-managed wi-fi hotspot in the lounge and lobby area for the cost of a $50 wireless access point and 10 minutes to hook it up to their router - but apparently this is either too much trouble or they are trying to force people to use the crappy \"console\" instead.... Very, very shabby - and considering that there is an excellent bar just down the street with unlimited, fast, free wi-fi for the cost of a beer, this really reflects very poorly indeed on the attitude of the hotel management.

One bad thing was that there was a really crap view out of our bedroom window. it was just like walls, as we were right in the middle of the hotel. that was probably the only downside. also because of this the room was quite dark. although since we were in a city we were doing lots and not spending very much time in the bedroom. i think if i was on a sun or beach holiday i would prefer a more spacious bedroom with a better view out the window.

The 1st room we were given had water dripping from the ceiling, quite substantionally as there was a puddle on the floor. We rang reception and were immediatley allocated another room, at the front of hotel as we had requested, and found this to be perfectly adequate. It was clean and functional, the bathroom was spotless too - i would guess this room had been one of the refurbed area's (518). The view was just fab, and the lovely hustle and bustle from the street below really helped to make our stay - i guess some people wouldn't like the noise, but we loved it. Breakfast was fine, pretty much every taste catered for - no complaints there. Room cleaned every day, fresh towels and bedding, and reception staff friendly and courteous. The location definatley gets 10/10 - try the Oyster Bar next door for early evening tapas and lovely cold white wine! Avoid Schilling Bar - over priced and horrible surly barstaff, not to mention making you wait ages and ages to pay! Should have walked out, not waited! Check-out time was before 12, which is later than a lot of places and once again, we were able to leave our luggage in reception.

The Rialto hotel is on Carrer Ferran, in the heart of the Gothic quarter: a wonderful location with many restaurants and typical shops nearby. Rambla within 5 minutes walking distance, although I think this is not the best bit of Barcelona (still don't understand what everybody likes about this tourist trap). I know many trip advisor-members complain about the noise in the Rialto, especially when you have a room in the front of the hotel. Our room was on the 5th floor, so the noise was bearable. I thought I had been smart, bringing my ear plugs, but on the second day the room maid threw the little box (with plugs in it) away. I sometimes had the impression that the cleaning staff spent more time re-arranging our pajamas (putting them in odd, sexy shapes, like in the window of a fashion store) than actually cleaning. The room itself was shabby and worn-out: big parts of the paint had come off, due to - we think - moisture problems, the beds were very noisy (no further comment ;)), but worst of all was the bathroom: it was impossible to controll the temperature of the water: it went from very cold to very hot in no time, and vice versa, without touching anything. The water from the tap in the sink went in every direction but the sink, and for a shower two people were needed: the one that was taking the shower, and someone to constantly pull up the tap handle that controlls the switching between water coming out of the tap or out of the shower (if you released it, the shower stopped). I still wonder what anyone travelling alone would have to do to take a decent shower! The young people (students?) at the reception desk were friendly, the older man (manager?) was not friendly or helpful at all. Would I recommend Barcelona and the Gothic Quarter as a destination? Yes, yes, yes!!! Would I recommend this hotel? Since the only good part of it is the location: definitely not. Here is an extra tip for anyone driving to Barcelona and desperately in search of a parking place that doesn't ruin you: you can park without any cost on the streets in the former olympic village of Barcelona (around Avinguda Icaria). The reception-man wouldn't help us on this subject, but a very friendly girl in the tourist information center on Placa Ferran made this suggestion. We were of course very grateful and spent the saved money on a lovely tapas dinner! With Riojan wine, of course!", "Date": "May 29, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Service": "3", "Rooms": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Chelmsford, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cGreat location, rooms on small side\u201d", "Author": "Artemis-Angel", "ReviewID": "UR4830102", "Content": "The location is great minutes from Las Ramblas.

It was nothing to do with the hotel and was in a clothes shop two doors to the right of the main entrance when you look at it from the street.

We've been to Barcelona before. I'd asked for a room at the front of the hotel with a balcony which afforded a great view, but came at a price.in terms of noise....dustbin men around 3am etc. Very narrow streets make for lots of echoes....! The Celtic fans didn't help either... we were near many of the irish bars....The room was very small - I had to walk sideways to get into bed... there was a large crack down the wall as well. The bathroom was so small that when I sat on the loo, I could have brushed my teeth at the sink in front of me... Had hot water though - no problems there. There was an incredibly strong drains smell in the toilet - there's a drain in the middle of the floor for cleaning and I'm not sure if that's where it came from. For those that have visited Barca before, it's aroma is just one of those things you learn to expect, but to have it lurking in your bathroom is not pleasant. We had to keep the toilet door closed when not in use else it became overpowering. We had to keep the windows closed at night in a feeble attempt to stop some of the noise - it doesn't work. Our room was not soundproofed - either windows or the walls either side. The air conditioning was fine when it worked, but kept causing the circuit breaker to kick in.... not sure why at all! We had to fix our toilet to stop it continuously filling. Bed linens changed daily IF you remember to put the card saying 'please make up my room' on your door. We didn't have one of these to begin with, and were not told to do this, therefore causing a run in with the maid, the housekeeper and the reception manager who tried to say it was our fault for not doing what we should have. I pointed out that a) if we had a card it would be useful, and b) who was supposed to tell us this rule! It was sorted promptly once they proved we had no card in the room. Breakfast is full of choice, but I had problems with the cold milk tasting sour every day.... which was odd as the hot milk didn't. The bar is very friendly and remarkably cheap! Carmen is a gem! We had no problems with staff attitude at reception (apart from the misunderstanding re room cleaning!). Overall, the hotel reminded me of hotels in London - a little faceless, dealing with many nationalities and a little tired. We paid \u00c2\u00a370 for the room per night including breakfast.
