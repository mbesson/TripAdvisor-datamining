{"Reviews": [{"Content": "Home Away From Home I've lost count of the number of times I've stayed here--individually, as a director for study abroad, and with a small group of friends. it's my home when I'm in Mexico City. The staff always greet me like an old friend, even when a year has passed. They go out of their way to make sure that my stay goes well, are competitive in price and service, have the perfect location, rooms are clean and comfortable, include breakfast and internet (which admittedly falters sometimes)...they made an emergency room change for me (long story, but they even sent someone to the room to help me collect my things and to make sure I was safe) and had someone run around town in the middle of the night to get me medicine when I was sick...did I mention they treat me like an old friend? ;-) Seriously, if you are looking for a place to stay in Mexico City, you don't need to look any further. My only warning is that you will want all of your hotel stays to be like this one!", "Date": "Dec 21, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR105684489", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "hokiehawk"}, {"Content": "Perfect Location, Pleasant Staff, Best Deal This is the type of Hotel that makes your vacation all the more enjoyable.

We paid AUD$32.00 per night for a king bedded room. Room is basic, but very clean. Bathroom was large and clean. We were sort of in the middle of the hotel on the 3rd floor with a view of the fire stairs. Staff were exceptionally friendly and helpful. Hotel was in a safe neighbourhood and close to everything. We walked to the centre of Mexico most of the time (about 30 minutes) but the trains are not that far and a quite easy to use (although it is very rare that you can get to where you want to go without changing trains at least once). We didn't try the restaurant, there are just too many vendors and restaurants etc around to spend the time in the hotel. There is a guy who sells great taco's just around the corner. Wasn't overly mad on Zona Rosa nightlife (thankfully not right on the hotels doorstep), too many strip joints, hookers and pimps for my liking, but saying that we never felt unsafe. Overall though the hotel was the best bargain on our six week holiday. BEWARE of dutyfree alcohol and perfumes etc at the airport, they are more expensive than buying it in Mexico city, such a rip off.", "Date": "Feb 15, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR794827815", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "2", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "Craigy"}, {"Content": "The Yes, But hotel As many reviewers have noted, this hotel is a bargain. It definitely was satisfactory and worth the price; I would stay there again. That said, there are areas where the hotel really needs to improve. Most of the points are minor, but they added up and really detracted from our stay. For example, on the hotel website, the following amenities are listed:Filtered water: YES, BUT this really means that one small bottle of filtered water is provided per guest, per day. In room safes: YES, BUT they aren't bolted down. You can lock your valuables in them, but anyone can walk away with the entire small safe.Wireless internet: YES, BUT there is a charge to get the password to be able to acess it.Business center: YES, BUT the printer doesn't work (so, you can't, for example, print out your boarding passes).This was the biggest problem:The hotel is not air conditioned (and doesn't really need to be given the moderate climate). YES, BUT there are no screens on any of the windows! You can't open the windows during mosquito season without screens (we tried and were nearly eaten alive). It can get quite hot with the windows closed, no fan, and no ac. The staff shrugged when we complained about the missing screens. We wound up sleeping wearing mosquito repellant and going out and buying cheesecloth to cover the windows.Again, the hotel is a good value, and I would stay there again, but the lack of very basic amenities--like screened windows during mosquito season--really needs to be addressed.", "Date": "Dec 16, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR430208575", "Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Business service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "3", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "JR434"}, {"Content": "Hidden Treasure he hotel is a hidden treasure for budget minded travelers. First of all, it is located very close (a 3-4 minute walk) to Zona Rosa, an area with lots of bars, clubs, and restaurants. It is considered to be a safe area too. Lots of people can be seen walking down the streets very late at night. Zona Rosa is also known as a gay meca, so you will see guys walking hand in hand and sometimes kissing each other. The hotel building doesn't look fancy at all. In fact, it looks like an apartment building rather than a hotel. It has a small lobby as well. However, the hotel has been recently remodeled and rooms have new Scandinavian style furniture. My room and a bathroom were kept miraculously clean. My room had basic amenities such as a telephone, cable TV, and a safe. It also was very quite, which allowed me to have a good rest after sight seeing and nights out. The queen size bed was comfortable as well. The staff was very helpful. They also have a close circuit cameras in the hallways that show that they take security of their guests seriously. Don't expect luxury amenities at Del Principado. However, if you are looking for a cosy, comfortable and cheap place in Mexico City, give it a try...
