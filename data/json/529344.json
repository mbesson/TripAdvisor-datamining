We understood that this was a budget hotel. Firstly the hairdryer was broken, the hose or pipe was torn, the staff tried to jam it back in there, but that was the only attempt. No alternative or compensation was offered. The door did not lock as it appeared that the door latch did not align properly with the door frame. The shower was tiny, plus the shower doors did not run on the tracks correctly meaning that they were unable to be closed completely. Towels were not replaced during our stay when we had requested it. Generally the room felt neglected, cracks in the walls and ceiling. Finally the breakfast was horrible, old stale rolls and very little of anything, Gernerally would not recommend this hotel, or keep your expectations very low.", "Date": "April 15, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Rennes, France", "Title": "\u201cGreat welcome\u201d", "Author": "Yozilla", "ReviewID": "UR125049602", "Content": "Very good hotel, well positioned, clean rooms...

A metro station and the railway station are not far. For entering the room you'll get a card, but only one, even if you are two. When you go somewhere, you must leave the card at the reception, but it is a usual practice in many other hotels. We could not find a good restaurant nearby, but I guess it was our fault that we did not really try. There is a supermarket very close to the hotel. The Italians do not eat much for breakfast, but the breakfast in the hotel was enough for us: thin slice of cheese and ham, a roll, a piece of cake, some juice, a yoghurt and coffee/tea. I just think that if you stay longer than one week, you want something different. Keep in mind that in Rome tourists pay tourist's fee - we paid 2 euros/per person/per day. We stayed in the hotel at the low-rate season and the price was really reasonable: 60 euros/per double room/per night. But if during \"hot season\" it is 150 euros as it is written in the room, I would say that it's expensive. In the rooms there are heaters, which was very comfortable. But when we opened the window at night, we got mosquitoes (which, of course, is not the hotel's fault!). For me the most important thing is staff's attitude, because if they are professional and friendly, you can solve any problem.

Hotel is in a great location - walking distance from Termini for airport and regional trains, and 100m from the metro stop. The neighbourhood is quiet at night but we did not feel unsafe. There are a couple of restaurants around but better to walk down towards the colosseum. About a block before you get there on the left is a range of great trattoria, pasta around 6 Euro and mains 10 euro. The room was spartan (see photos) but actually quite large given other Italian offerings, there is actually space for you to unpack and there is a safe in the wardrobe. The 'queen' bed was actually two singles pushed together with a queen spread, not entirely comfortable but you will sleep on it if tired. There is a TV with BBC and italian channels, enough to catch up on news. Mould in the bathroom, but thankfully not on any surface we were touching (mainly above the toilet and shower screen, see photo). Does not inspire confidence about the cleaning. It would probably help the 'humidity' if they installed a exhaust fan. The man on the check-in desk was very helpful, giving us a map and pointing out the best way to get to everything. No other services on-site, but laundromats and internet hubs close by. Breakfast was disappointing, they had blood orange juice from concentrate, worst croissants I've ever had (we'd just come from France), cereal, tea and coffee, not much else.

There was a good gelateria nearby, and it was fun to be in a real neighborhood rather than the usual tourist areas. It is a short walk from the Metro station, on a quiet side street. We wished we had had more time so we could have taken advantage of the pleasant courtyard in the back. Breakfast was fine, though not particularly memorable. The desk clerks and other staff were very pleasant. Our room was on the second floor (what we in the US call the third), and was rather spartan, no luxuries nor decorations. I did comment at the time that it is perhaps no worse to have nothing on the walls than to have some of the trash that passes for decor in many hotels I have visited. The room was clean, and everything was functional, but the peeling paint in the bathroom gave a poor impression.

It is simply the worst hotel I have ever stayed in. The single standard room I booked (#110) was on the second floor and there was no lift, I had to drag my bag up the stairs. The room was a dog box, hot and awful. The Manager did not have an electric fan that I could use until he suddenly remembered where one was after I gave him an Australian calander. That did make life a bit more beaerable. The bed itself was ok but the single pillow supplied was no more than 2 inches thick. I had to beg for another one and on my last night in October I had to put up with a heavy lumpy thing because the Hotel did not have a spare pillow because \"they were fully booked that night\" The copious quanties of black mould in the bathroom is a testament to the disgusting level of the cleaning in this Hotel. In addition to the mould, on the last night in October there were nasty stains on the floor just inside the door and under the shower that were not there during my earlier stay. The shower is a joke. It is a shower head in the ceiling that sprays the water all over the bathroom and the toilet seat and you have to mop it up with towels after you use it otherwise you tread water everywhere. At times I had to have it running flat out for 10 minutes before some luke warm water eventually flowed through. The big 2 way shower tap is located in a stupid place on the wall. Twice whilst walking past it to get to the toilet I accidently knocked it on and got drenched. The noise coming in the room from the nearby Via Manzoni and the noise from the corridor and ajoining rooms is simply awful. It is impossible to sleep properly even with ear plugs. The only good points about this Hotel are the staff are nice, especially Luigi who was really good to me, and the fact that there are 2 really good supermarkets only about a 3 minute walk away. The rate of 50 Euros a night for the single standard room is good for Rome but I really wonder if this dump of a Hotel is even worth that.
