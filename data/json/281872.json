Next the beds were beyond nasty with cigarette burns in them and very dirty. The bath water was yellow and the bathroom was disgusting and the drain was clogged up. We complained about all of this and they said nothing could be done and refused to give us our money back. So not wanting to stay in that filthy room anymore we went out for the night and when we came back around 9:30 we realized had left both keys in the room. There was nobody working other than the cat in the front office so using a credit card I broke into the room. So really comforting to know how easy it was to get into the rooms. Also because the rooms were so bad we bought blow up floats to put on top of thr beds ti sleep on. For our troubles we were promised a bigger room over looking the beach the next morning and when I went to ask about it we were told no rooms were open and for me to go knock on the door and ask the people when they were leaving. After about an hour of waiting I continued to express how disappointed we were they finally gave me my money back and we packed up in like 5 minutes and left this horribke place!!!! I would rather sleep in a box than stay here again.", "Date": "July 20, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Location": "2", "Rooms": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cDangerous and Nasty!

Nasty rooms, the bed had trash under it and used cotton balls , I asked the maid to clean it and was told they only clean under the beds when they do a \"deep clean.\" Our room had no AC or water on arrival. Water was turned on within 6 hours, but it took 48 hours for AC. Room smelled like mold and we bought our own cleaning products to clean the room. Day 3 we ordered pizza and the delivery guy got stuck in the elevator. He pressed the help button and yelled and scremed, I called the front desk and informed them. The delivery guy got out on another floor and brought the pizza, he was sweating and jerking all over poor guy. About 5 min later a lady from the front office came by and asked if I had called for help for the man and I said yes. She rudely informed me that I should have called her and let her know he had gotten out and to remember that for the NEXT TIME!! I said I'm sorry I thought you let the guy out on a different floor. So no elevator for 24 hours. Well that takes us to day 5. My 3 years old son decides to press the elevator button like all children do and was electrocuted! It was reported to the front desk to a lady named Jeanette [--] who says she is the owner. She goes to the elevator presses the button and says \"it didn't shock me. There is nothing I can do about it.\" Why did we stay so long you ask? The policy you sign at checkin says absolutely no refunds!

The rooms are clean, every ocean view room has it's own private balcony/patio, the laundry rooms are clean and functional, the kitchenettes are fully equipped with pots, pans, silverware, etc. The help is friendly and available. Can't beat the location; a nice half-hour stroll up the beach takes you from the relative quiet and space of the beach a few steps from the Cove to the tacky/cool noise and action of the pier area. 10 year-old daughter loved it, middle-aged mom and dad loved it, senior neighbors seemed to love it.

The cove is close to all attractions that Daytona has to offer as well as being directly on one of the greatest beaches in Florida. The staff was friendly and understanding to help out a few out of towners who wanted to have a good time. The rooms were clean and the maid service was excellent. I am visiting this hotel again this year and I cant wait to get down there.
