We booked through Timeshare and can say that anyone contemplating a holiday in Bali we would recommend that the Bali Masari is well worth considering. Especially if you want a completely relaxing holiday, with nothing to do, in surroundings to die for, and staff - from the humblest gardener and driver, to the office manager - who cannot do enough for you.We have loved Bali, and its people, for many years and have sympathised with them through their struggles. It is sad to see the small number of tourists present throughout the island, however we still found the people to be just as warm and friendly, and felt safe and comfortable at all times.The Bali Masari is situated mid way between Sanur and Ubud (20 minutes by car either way, and roughly A6 per trip). The hotel is located on a cliff top overlooking the Petanu River valley, and five minutes from Sukawati, which has a bigger market than Ubud, but with more emphasis on art and craft, but not much more to offer. The resort is isolated, but if you want to relax and do nothing, this is the ideal place.The driver , Ketut, was friendly, cooperative and talkative and knew all the places to go without getting you ripped off.The first impression was of a long narrow roadway which opened out onto a wonderful view of the valley and reception. The reception area was spacious and the staff attentive. All the usual tours are available but the staff were never pushy.The pool area is large with an immaculate infinity pool overlooking the valley, clean towels were always available, which was not difficult as we were the only guests to use the pool during our stay.The Spa is amazing with skilful attentive staff, and two separate massage rooms overlooking the river, each with its own sunken spa bath. And, for those couples that want to do everything together there is a double room with two massage tables and a huge double sunken spa bath looking out at the valley and the river below.The restaurant was quite large, holding about 30 diners, even though there were only about six guests staying at the rsort meaning we had the restaurant to ourselves on most occasions. The restaurant has a comprehensive menu, Western and Asian, and a reasonable beverage list, all at reasonable prices. The food was good and we had most of our meals at the resort, with room service available 24 hours a day.The units are brilliant! We stayed in a huge two-bedroomed Cempaka villa which was fully self contained, with a partial kitchen, full size refrigerator, two full size bathrooms, including bath, shower and outside shower room, a separate plunge pool, TV, DVD player and quality fittings and furnishings throughout. The are one-bedroom Jepun units, two-bedroom Cempaka villas on one level, and two-bedroom Jempiring villas on two levels, but only 12 units in total so you never feel crowded out. And we haven't mentioned the staff yet.The staff were everywhere, but never intrusive. The gardens were tended daily, the pool was immaculate, The Spa staff wonderful, the security guards unobtrusive, and the restaurant staff friendly and very professional. I admit we were normally the only diners but it did give us the opportunity to engage the staff in conversation - which they loved, we are still conversing by email weeks later. The units were cleaned daily, and the night boys would arrive about 6pm and turn down the beds, close all the blinds and curtains, turn on the lights, set up the electric bug killers in every room and spray the rooms for mosquitos every night. Not that they were a problem anyway, but this was yet another example of the small touches that made a wonderful holiday. Nothing was a bother!Thank you to everyone at Bali Masari. It is a wonderful relaxing place in a beautiful setting and well deserving of its awards. We'll be back!", "Date": "Mar 4, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR211850789", "Ratings": {"Service": "-1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "-1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "5", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "-1", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "TasMissy"}, {"Content": "Amazing views at Bali Masari We stayed here on the second leg of our two-week honeymoon and it was amazing! You can see the true Bali across the river from your villa. Every day we looked forward to watching kids fly kites and village people walking down to the river to do chores.The service was fantastic! Everyone took the time to get to know us. The food was super in Ferry's restaurant - our favs were the pineapple pancakes, nasi goreng, and the beef stroganoff. They set us up with a fantastic driver as well- if you go, ask for Astra. We really felt like we were in the real Bali and not some foreign owned resort. We'd go back in a heartbeat.", "Date": "Aug 24, 2006", "ReviewID": "UR821166392", "Ratings": {"Service": "-1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "-1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "5", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "-1", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "Mr&MrsD"}, {"Content": "Masari magnificent       Sunset", "Date": "Apr 29, 2006", "ReviewID": "UR259972853", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "5", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "NiceView"}, {"Content": "I would recommend this hotel to everyone!!!!
