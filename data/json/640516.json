Located at the quiet Jalan Besar, this hotel is a five minutes walk from Serangaoon road and Mustafa. Orchard Road, Bugis, China Town and Ferrar Park MRT station are all within 10 to 15 minutes walking distance. Bus stop is just next to the Hotel. Taxis are easily available in front of the hotel. Our Room was reasonable in size considering Singapore, having enough space to keep the luggage and shopping bags etc. We opted for a road facing room with a window which is a bit costly than rooms without window or view. The view from the window is though limited to the rooftop of Mustafa, nearby buildings and Jalan Besar; still you can enjoy the variety of passing vehicles, specially at night. If you keep the glass window closed, your room becomes almost soundproof. Though the hotel provided buffet breakfast but the menu was mediocre without any change on all 4 days of our stay. Above all, the staff was not so pleased when asked for second helping of Baked Beans or anyother items which was not available at the self service counter and had to be brought from the kitchen inside. There is no restaurant or room service in the hotel but there are plenty of Indian Restaurants at a stone's throw away. Tea/Coffee making facility with four free sachets everyday is provided in rooms. Drinking water has to be brought from outside or you can use the tap water. The hotel does not provide drinking water. The housekeeping was almost satisfactory with clean bedsheets and free toiletries which were changed everyday. Request for extra towels and pillows was met. Stil, the reception staff is not very welcoming and was reluctant to reply our some queries. This may be because the hotel remains almost ocuupied due to its location and no frill clean rooms. Although there is an elevator, You have to carry your baggage yourself to your rooms as there is no porter facility because they call it a budget hotel. If you can manage without room service, carry your baggage from the road to your room on your own, eat the same variety of breakfast everyday, bring your own drinking water, this hotel can provide you with clean rooms and good sleep at price which are better compared to similar hotels nearby.", "Date": "May 27, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "1", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Sleep Quality": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "canberra", "Title": "\u201cNot so cheap, and very rough hotel.\u201d", "Author": "dlr01", "ReviewID": "UR94555875", "Content": "We ended up staying at this hotel because the nearbly hotel we had booked, refused to honour our booking. This was on the 30th December, so we had no choice but to stay at this hotel as most hotels in Singapore were booked for New Years Eve / holiday Celebrations. Initially the management were very sympathetic to our predicament, they quoted very resonable rates for there rooms. The hotel was not booked and had plenty of rooms available. Once the management realized we would be staying for three more nigts and realizing money could be made, the hotel rate was suddenly increased, and cash payment was demanded from us. The rooms, we had two, one for our children and one for us, not connecting, both with two single beds, were smelly and not all that clean.The beds were very hard as were the pillows The bathroom was very shabby. I believe smoking was allowed in the hallways and the smell was very strong, and permeated the bedrooms. On numerous occasions when we left the rooms, we could not re-enter with our keycard when we returned, and had to go back down to reception and get someone to come up with a key and let us into our rooms. The area the hotel is located in, is not very upmarket and has lots of \"late night\" venues operating from it! It is a long walk to the main tourist area of Singapore.", "Date": "January 27, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "KL", "Title": "\u201cGreat Hotel!!! Great Value!!!\u201d", "Author": "esmeain", "ReviewID": "UR85802033", "Content": "I booked this hotel in July '10 when the price was still SGD85 for standard room. The price has increased now to SGD115 if I'm not mistaken. Lucky me, they managed to maintain the old price for us. I have no high expectation at first for this hotel because it is not really well-known and it is a budget hotel. Most travellers opt for backpackers hostel, which with attached bathroom almost reach the same price with Classique Hotel. To our surprise, the room was great (no window), bathroom was spotless, it has mini bar, coffe & tea making facilities, 21 inch colour tv, nothing in that room worth to be labeled as budget hotel. Too bad it didn't come with extra pillows. I'd give my own 3.5 stars to Classique Hotel! Worth our money. The hotel is one block away from City Square Mall, near to Mustaffa Shopping mall (24 hrs), near to Little India, and the nearest MRT is Farrer Park (pls choose exit I,it headed to City Square Mall). In addition to that, we could leave our bags at the reception area after checkout, to go for shopping.

It did have a smoky musty smell , staff were pleasant and the price reasonable. This could actually be a good boutique hotel it had some great design features and the furniture was good, but does need some work, we didni` eat in ( pleanty of places nearby), internet didn`t work ( was expensive) no printer to checkin on line for flights ( went to Singapore airlines on Orchard and printed there).

The rooms were small - really small and ours had no window. However they were clean and made up each day. Air conditioning was ultra efficient - too efficient as despite trying to raise temperature and lower the fan speed we froze at night. One skimpy blanket was inadequate and luckily we both had thermal underwear in the depths of our luggage as we were to be returning to Southern Hemisphere's cold weather after Singapore and had taken these items to lessen impact of arriving at Christchurch airport in winter. Never expected to be sleeping in thermals in Singapore - crazy! Breakfast was very basic compared to tourist hotels but hey, the price was so good you can't really complain.

When we got there, we were told we were getting a discount on the 160 dollars we were quoted, down to about 125 a night which was a nice surprise. However, i believe this was because they knew that there were roadworks going on all night on the road outside, which was right under our window. So we had to contend with the noise of a jackhammer all night, as well as my girlfriend waking up to quite a few bites on her legs...but there were no mosquitos in the room...??? We also were given 2 singles when we requested a double! The rooms themselves were ok and seemed clean, the breakfast included was good, however we moved to the Furama Riverfront after the first night as we found a last minute deal of 170 a night, which was basically what we were paying at Classique. If you want cheap accomodation in Singapore but not a hostel, this would do, without the roadworks & bites it would have been ok. Oh and there is cheap internet in the lobby. 1 dollar for 15 mins.", "Date": "January 14, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Bristol", "Title": "\u201cSomething Strange\u201d", "Author": "ukulelemaybe", "ReviewID": "UR14862603", "Content": "I arrived there in the early evening, about an hour before I'd advised them I would, to be told that the room was still occupied and I'd have to come back in an hour by which time it would be ready for me.

This hotel was recommended here as a mid range choice, and we really liked the hotel. It was a short ride from the airport, less than 30 minutes. We arrived late, and the front desk was great about checking us in so late, and we stayed in a nice twin room, very clean and it was a boutique style room, nicely painted, and very quiet. It had a safe in the room, and even a tub which was a nice bonus after such a long day of flying. The room had a safe and tv, and coffee maker as well. The breakfast included was a miss, and seemed more of an english breakfast and the same for all. The location was on the edge of little india, and about a 6 block walk to the action .
