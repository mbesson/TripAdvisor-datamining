I stayed here in 1965 as a young woman with husband and children and thought that it would be nostalgic being alone to revisit this hotel. First memories do get distorted but I remember lots of gold on shoulders of door men and elegant surroundings and people who were immensely helpful. Wonderful breakfast in the garden with freshly squeezed blood orange, piano playing and the sense of elegance . All of that has gone. Little plastic chairs and tables, breakfast perfectly adquate, the ubiquitous scrambled egg, bacon, weiner sausage, pastries, bread coffee tea etc. eggs prepared in different ways could be ordered at a certain cost. I had just flown in from the west coast of Canada and was looking forward to an elegant room in old fashioned surroundings. The first room I was shown would not have even suited a cloistered Nun.. see room 209... should not even be rented... I returned to the desk and said that I could not possibly stay there and so was given another key with the advice that if that did not suit I was to return.. Well this room was comfortable... especially by comparison.. it did not look over the small courtyard garden but by this time I was glad to just have a spacious room. Rm 236. The room was clean, the beds hard... the bathroom warm and the water hot. The location of course is superb the people at the desk during the day were very helpful, never saw the rather surly first guy again., there is internet and machines in the foyer for use. Room was cleaned late in the day. Would I stay there again? probably not. But for the location perhaps yes, altho there are lots of good looking hotels in the same area. There is a bus stop just opposite and the metro is half a block down the street. It is within walking distance of Termini and all those hop on off buses.", "Date": "April 20, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "2", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cWhat do you like about This Hotel i really dont get..\u201d", "Author": "Drufukbasoglusonmez", "ReviewID": "UR128170511", "Content": "The Hotel is too old, rooms are small, breakfast is about of 2 kinds of cheese and bacon.

The hotel itself is located in a brillant part of the city which is central to most things. In Rome it is easy to walk everywhere. The hotel is situated in one of the main shopping streets and is about 15 to 20 mins walk from every sight you could want to see. The hotel itself is clean and welcoming, the issue was with our room. Although clean we had a standard room and I would not recomend it and pay more for a suite. Our room was tiny and the window had no view and was overlooking the roof of the restaurant. The bathroom looked impressive but completely inpractical with the shower. The shower was over the bath but instead of at either end it was placed in the middle which meant that it was aimed right over the bath onto the floor. There was a shower curtain but unless you are super small and skinny it is imposible to shower without having a fight with the shower curtain as you had no room and it meant the water ended up on the floor each day. Second problem with the shower was that there was hardly any water pressure so took forever to wash suds away. Third problem with the shower was that you had three choices, freezing cold, barely luke warm or scorching hot. I actually burtnt my scalp the first morning and i like hot showers but this was kettle hot and dangerous! So, shower a BIG problem. The hotel allows smokers in the rooms, this was a shock as our room smelt constantly of smoke each day as it seemed every one in our corridor smoked, as non smokers this was annoying. What worried me the most though was that our window did not lock close and we were overlooking a flat roof, everyones windows overlooked this and at any time someone could climb out of their window into our room and vice versa as there was no way to close the window, one morning we actually heard someone moving around out there and it was very scary! In short, the location was fantastic and the hotel offered so much but the lows were so low that I would not recomend or stay here again, I wish it was different as it was a beautiful hotel, prehaps the suites are nicer.", "Date": "March 31, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Bristol, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cSlightly faded grandeur, characterful, spacious and comfortable\u201d", "Author": "Heather255", "ReviewID": "UR126722977", "Content": "We'd asked for a quiet twin room at the back and were given room 537, an enormous corner room overlooking a side street, with a huge bathroom.

We asked to change rooms and were moved to 538 which wasn't actually next door but at the back overlooking the garden, with french windows onto a delightful balcony. Smaller but nicer, lovely bathroom with opening window, just as comfortable and still twice the size of the average city hotel with bags of character too. Furniture in both rooms was v old-fashioned, quite fancy and impressive but rather battered though this just added to the character.

It's in a good location in a safe part of Rome, about 15 mins walk from the Trevi fountain and other popular tourist sites - the Collosseum is just down the road (turn left out the hotel, then turn left on via Serpenti and you'll see it in front of you). The Parthenon and Spanish Steps are walkable as well, and I took a stroll up to the Villa Medici on a nice sunny morning during my stay. The hotel itself is well appointed and the staff are friendly and helpful; although I speak Italian, all the front desk staff are multi-lingual and most of them speak English. It's a deceptively large hotel and my room was at the end of a long corridor - it's one of those old buildings with very high ceilings, but has been modernised over the years. My room was nice and quiet as it looked out over a courtyard/covered building at the rear of the hotel; it should be noted though that rooms at the front of the hotel can be very noisy due to the busy road outside. The rooms are a bit stuffy as well, so if you have to open a window it'll get even more noisy. Ask for a room away from the road and you'll be fine. There's a large, grand salon room downstairs near reception with a roaring fire where you can sit and have a beer or a coffee, and there's a restaurant on site. I have to say I wasn't very impressed with the food at the restaurant; I like my pasta al dente but the starter that we had was undercooked, with a white flouriness in the middle. I would class the food as average. Anyway, there are many, many restaurants within an easy walk of this hotel, so this isn't a huge problem. Facilities in the hotel are good. There's a small gym downstairs, free for guest use, and there's free wi-fi for all guests (just ask for a password at reception). One minor disappointment is that there are no irons/ironing boards in any of the rooms due to fire regulations - if you want a shirt pressed, you'll have to get the hotel laundry to do it for you (and pay accordingly).

The first, time, we were brought 1 pillow when we requested 3. The second time, we were completely ignored. The 3rd time, housekeeping brought us 2 new toiletry kits instead, and I had to explain what I wanted again- and she only brought 1 of the requested 2 pillows. We gave up at that point. Very frustrating. The bathroom was very dated, and had several issues. The bidet did not work at all. The shower had no pressure whatsoever, and the heat settings were such that it was either extremely hot or extremely cold- there was no in-between. It took literally 5 minutes to get hot water every time the shower was turned on. We had a balcony- that we could not use and had a terrible view of nothing except an open interior space looking into what appeared to be the laundry. One reason we had chosen Hotel Quirinale was because it said it had laundry services. And yes, it does- if you don't mind paying 4 euros to get a pair of socks washed, or 8 euros for a pair of pants. No thanks. The staff was not overly helpful. If you asked a question, they would answer, but did not have any additional suggestions, and often looked as though we were wasting their time. We did not feel like valued guests at all. The good: Breakfast was very nice, and plentiful. The eggs with the arrabiata sauce were lovely, in fact. The location was absolutely perfect. We could walk to the metro, the train station, the Vatican, Trevi Fountain, the Colosseum, the Forum. At first we thought we were perhaps being too picky, but when we left Rome, we went to Pompei and stayed in the lovely 3-star Hotel Diana for 4 nights. The experience was night and day.

Obviously, in some aspects this is a plus, such as the size of the rooms (huge by 2011 standards) and the high ceilings, in other places it leads to a shoddy effect, such as the carpets which have definitely seen better days. The bathroom was also incredibly large, with excellent water pressure, and the usual toiletries provided (bring your own conditioner, the norm in Italy). A corridor led to the bedroom and a walk-in closet could be found off the corridor, though there was no wardrobe or chest of drawers in the room itself. The bed was pretty comfortable and a flat screen TV was provided with a generous choice of channels for free. Being shortsighted, the mirrors provided were inadequate for me as they were behind a very large sink or vanity making it impossible for me to get close enough to do my make-up :) It's well located on one of Rome's main thoroughfares (Via Nazionale), just around the corner from the main train station, Termini, though the area around the hotel itself is very safe and you wouldn't even realise the train station is close by. It's also a short bus or taxi ride away from the centro storico. In truth, you can also walk to many key locations such as the Colosseum and the Vittoriano and Piazza Venezia, which then leads on to the Pantheon. The onsite restaurant is excellent, 5 star standard food, service with a smile, and prices are very decent.

Rooms The room we had consisted of twin beds. The beds were comfortable, and the room itself was great. Our view was not wonderful as it looked over the roof at the back of the building, however this was not important to us as we were always gone during the day, and generally not returning until later in the evening. I would rather be at the back as the sirens were non stop on the street. Our shower did not work, but the hose did so we just sat in the tub to shower...no big deal. Draperies and ambiance wonderful. Lobby Checking in was wonderful, the staff was very helpful, as well as the doorman. The area where you could relax, just past the lobby was full of old world decor. My daughter and I would come back mid afternoon and have a cafe americano, and we would be served a plate of cookies as well. When we had a drink in the evening we were given chips and peanuts. What a great service, and the prices were reasonable. Breakfast We had breakfast every morning in the garden. There was a lot of selection and the coffee was superb. The view of the garden was spectacular and we loved this part of our trip. Location The location of this hotel was perfect for our city excursions. We did a lot of walking which we enjoyed.

I consciously picked up this hotel because of the garden, and asked for a room overlooking it. I knew I wanted to avoid street side in Roma. And was I right! My room was actually a corner room and just the side street was very noisy. Fortunately the windows are double pane, with outside and inside wood-shutters and heavy curtains (yet barely enough). Inside it was very quite. (ask for a room towards the inside of the block. I was lucky to be upgraded to a suite (324), corner room with a sitting area and a VERY large bed room. The style is Classic, the furniture sometimes feels more old than Classic. Yet not too badly so. The bedding was ok, did not strike me as either bad or excellent. The bathroom large and clean with a large window. Bathrobes and slippers. Amenities : could be improved. Flat TV (41\"). but no guide... good luck. I regretted no water-heater and iron in the room, but apparently a policy to avoid fire. In general the room was very clean and the service was good, most of the time amiable. I really enjoyed breakfast in the veranda by the garden or in the garden. The buffet was really nice (I indulged on fresh fruit salad and great coffee everyday, of course there is much more - Italy is not so strong on pastries and breads though) One night the garden hosted a costume party - that I saw from the window. Renaissance style... in case you would be interested ask about this. The lounges are very roomy (extra high ceilings), a bar is opened inside and outside in the garden (all day ?). The garden is a bit smaller than ou would think from the web site. But very nicely planted. with a charming foutain (could have done a better job with the decoration of the outside restaurant area) And the hotel is very well located for visiting most of central Roma by foot.

When we went to front desk for help, they were not prepared to assist us by using their computer, and merely told us to go to an internet cafe (which was closed) This clouded the friendliness of the other staff expereinces. We would say, if you want to pay 325 Euros a night for a \"4\" star, dont stay here, do your homework. We would rate this a 2 star, bordering on a 3.

Nearest main attraction was the Colosseum -- we got lost so our estimation of distance isn't the best but it was easily a 20 minute walk or more despite the front desk saying it was ten minutes. No business center or place to print boarding passes which I thought was odd for such a large hotel, but there's a business center nearby. Staff could be more helpful. Excellent restaurant and beautiful courtyard. So-so breakfast but the location was great, overlooking the lovely courtyard. We had a room on the courtyard, which was a bit dicey because there was a wedding going on -- noise ended around midnight, but that could be a concern for folks in warmer months who like to turn in early. Also, there wasn't free Internet access, but you could purchase if you needed to. The air conditioning in this hotel was excellent -- and since we were in Rome when it was over 90, that is a big endorsement.

At the top of the street is the termini station so great location for access to transport. Althou like any city you will spend alot of time walking anyway. The hotel itself is antique style, big rooms, high ceilings and overall giving a 'grand' feeling.. We had an early flight so our rooms were not ready on arrival (we got there at approx 11am), we had to wait a couple of hours. The hotel has a lovely garden/ courtyard (this is where the wedding receptions are held!) which was lovely to sit out in. The rooms in the hotel definitely vary, we were in room 118 which is a double room and it was very clean, high ceilings, good air conditioning, big enough bathroom, beds werent great thou, not very lavish or comfy, basic style! However in comparison to some of the other rooms my family had, there were much better rooms on offer. Breakfast in the hotel was great, big offering of hot and cold food and lovely pastries, cakes, cereals, yoghurts etc. its served from 6am-10am. The only negative thing I must comment on was the price of drinks in the hotel- OMG shockingly expensive we thought. A can of fanta/ coke etc. was \u20ac5 which was unbelieveable really and a vodka and redbull for example was \u20ac11, extremely expensive even by Irish standards!!! As I mentioned we were part of a wedding, the wedding itself was lovely, we had our dinner outside inthe courtyard and the tables were set lovely..the food wasnt great (althou it must be said that perhaps this was because it was not what we were use to in terms of a typical Irish wedding dinner menu) octapus salad for starters, followed by raveolli, followed by beef and veg (which was ok) and desert.

However the character of the building along with the service from the excellent staff, make it an great place to stay, whether you're hosting a large event as we were, of just as a base from which to explore Rome. The imperial Forae are a ten minute walk away; it's right beside the Metro and many sightseeing busses leave from Piazza della Repubblica which is just around the corner. The rooms are spacious (all with chandeliers) and the buffet breakfast is excellent. In our specific experience we can also say that the banqueting facilities are fantastic and that the hotel went to every length to make sure that we had a wonderful wedding. We appreciated this even more as our wedding was on April 23rd, right in the middle of the Volcanic ash flight disruptions so up to Thursday 22nd we were only able to confirm around 15 guests, having had to travel overland from Dublin ourselves. Sarita, who was in charge of our reception was very understanding and practical saying that she only needed around 24 hours notice of final numbers. Luckily the flight ban was lifted in time and 99% of our guests made it into Rome by lunchtime on thursday. Once we confirmed numbers with Sarita everything was ready on time, from menus to seating charts, food and drink to waiting staff.

My stay was decent, room was comfortable, but not luxurious, service was ok, location was excellant.

However this may have been pot luck, as our tour around the Vatican was spent trudging streets for the first hour out of 2.5 hours, being taken to a gift shop, waiting for radios.

It is a classic design (mid 1800s) and in Rome is all the better for it. Fittings are clean and not worn and everything is kept very clean. The breakfast buffet is far better than a continental breakfast and the restaurant overlooks a well kept garden with an open terrace.It has spacious public areas to chill out. It is a great location just 50m from Republica tube and bus stops are outside. The rooms, for a city hotel, are surprisingly spacious and we had a very comfortable six foot bed. My only criticism of the plumbing was the temperamental shower but the bathroom did have a bidet. Towels were changed daily and the room had air conditioning. It overlooked not a lot and was quiet but some rooms will overlook the busy street, but that is city life for you!. The staff spoke adequate English and were polite and delivered a fax promptly and to my room. Local phone calls appear to be free (we were not charged). There is the usual menu of TV channels, including films and English and quite expensive broadband options. Overall heartily recommended with no hesitation to return. Some tips for those staying there All soft drinks and water in Rome are expensive. Mc Donalds is only 60m away (out of door turn right and on roundabout) and has cheapish drinks inc water. Buy a Roma pass from the newstand , out of door turn right for 50m, and get entry to the Coliseum (and others) and 3 days on the buses and tubes for a value price. Even if we had not used the transport bypassing the horrendous queues at the Coliseum was worth it. Do not be tempted by the inflated prices here for the Vatican. They have much better systems to get in, without queuing so buy them at the door. The open top tour is great and leaves from outside McDonalds (Open city green buses). 2 days are little more cost than one day so you can use it as transport as a hop on and off service. Very regular but only till mid evening and posssibly a little slow if you're crossing town in a hurry. The Rome pass is inserted in the ticket machine in the public buses so that's another way to travel to all the major sights. Rome is walkable but you'll cover miles at the sights and the cobbled streets may tire you. Avoid the taxis, even the official ones (SPQR logo). The Termini station( direct line to airport) is only 300m away yet the cab took the long way and charged 28 Euros! Walk or take tube for one stop). Avoid the train from the airport if you have heavy luggage as there are several steps up to get into the train (and off) and for an airport express not luggage friendly. We booked a hop on minibus for the return journey which is pre booked, picks up from the hotel and for two people not much more expensive than the train Navona square is really recommended for street life and entertainment and al fresco eating but like most eating out in Rome, not that cheap About 80 Euros for two with one drink each.

Upon arrival, we were met with a Basil Fawlty style greeting - I actually thought we were in the wrong hotel when we walked through the doors \u2013 this establishment is in no way worthy of its 4 star rating \u2013 more like a 2 star rating at most. The \u201cgentlemen\u201d at reception kept us waiting an age before checking us in. They were rude and brusque. A porter was assigned to us to bring us and our baggage to our room. The first room were were taken to (on the 2nd floor), was appalling \u2013 dark and dank, with 1 double bed \u2013 we are two ladies and had requested when booking with Citialia, for a twin room \u2013 2 twin beds. I had even rang to double check this in advance of making the booking and it was duley noted on the booking documents that were posted out to me. We alerted the porter to this, who rang reception, and, after much deliberation and shouting !! on the phone, we were taken to a room on the 4th floor, at the front of the building. Room was large and clean, but very VERY basic. It had a wooden trouser press that exhibited the latest in wireless technology (This was similar to one found in the Villa of Lucius Calpurnius circa 1 A.D !!). The \u201cbathroom\u201d had been installed by the romans in circa 549 B.C !! \u2013 the shower had a boiling hot dribble of water, the taps in the sink shot water out in bursts which went everywhere except the sink ! The ancient plumbing was directly connected to the Cloaca Maxima, and was constructed in the time of Tarquinius Priscus .There was a coating of mould on the shower curtain, which had previously been installed in the Diocletian circa 305A.D. There was 1 electricity plug point in the entire room, and our room was connected to another room via a small passage and a locked door. You could hear EVERYTHING from the guest room next door ( when the sound of passing traffic on the street outside abated). There was no air conditioning so I can only imagine what the heat would be like on the summer months in that room ( it was 540 by the way). Traffic passing by the front of the hotel, caused our room to vibrate \u2013 casting serious doubt over the soundness of the structure and foundations of this ancient construction. Now, to the \u201cFree Lunch\u201d debacle. As per Citialia\u2019s website and brouchure, our 8 night B&B package included a free lunch each day with wine. When we checked in we were given 8 paper vouchers for lunch, which we were instructed to present at the dining room upon arrival each day, which we duly did. The food itself was bland ,but we didn\u2019t complain, as it was free. The menu itself did not change over the entire 8 days, and we were given a \u00bd bottle of house red or white wine each day, which was fine. Ordering food, and its delivery to the table, was a job in itself \u2013 surly staff hurled startes and main courses out at the same time, insisted on serving side orders AFTER the meal,deserts were the leftover deserts from the previous evening meal and arrived up to 30 minutes later. We were offered mineral water with each lunch, which we accepted, and offered tea and coffee after each lunch, which we also took. Now, for the sting in the tail \u2013 when we were checking out, we were presented with a bill ! \u2013 please note that we had paid Citialia in full for the holiday when we booked in advance of our arrival at the hotel, so this charge of \u20ac120.00 was a mystery. When I asked what this charge related to, I was initially told it was the charge for each lunch ? \u2013 I produced the Citialia booking receipts which detailed the \u201cfree daily lunch with wine\u201d, which was snatched out of my hand by the ever courteous man on reception. There was much deliberation between the 3 \u2013Amigo\u2019s behind the desk. The man returned and said the charges were for the wine, I said no, and again pointed out \u201cfree lunch including wine\u201d. He again conferred with the board and upon return declared that the charge was for tea\u2019s and water ! \u2013 which, conveniently cost \u20ac6.00 for the large bottle of water and \u20ac4.50 for each tea/coffee (we had 1 bottle of water and 2 tea\u2019s with each lunch). This was never made clear in Citialia\u2019s brouchure, receipts, or by the Rep \u2013 who I rang when this debacle was going on. The man at reception shouted and roared at us, insisting the charges were for wine, and when I showed him the Citialia documents, he said he didn\u2019t give a [--] what Citialia said !! This all occurred in front of other hotel guests, and was mortifying. Every night, there is \u201clive music\u201d which comprises of the same guy, who plays the same set of songs.

Some people have reviewed the hotel bar and lobby as old, needing an update, but we loved its old world interior.

I was very appreciative that they granted my request and reassigned my room to a side street (Via Torino), and was granted my request of a room with a bathtub. Breakfast was plentiful and tasty in a very attractive dining room. There is also outside dining overlooking a pretty courtyard, but the weather was chilly and I opted to stay inside. The hotel is decorated in antiques and has an old world charachter that to some may not be to their liking. I rather enjoy the past and if in Rome, old world is my choice. My one disappointment is the fact that this hotel charges a rather steep fee for internet use. Being a single female traveler, Internet use is a number one priority to me, as this is my way to communicate with family back home to keep them informed of my whereabouts as I travel through. The high price this hotel charges for internet use prevented me from using the service. I strongly believe that this service should be provided to guests free of charge, or at least at a reasonable rate. Eight Euros for 1 hour of internet service is excessive, and I'm afraid is a way to gouge the guests for extra revenue after we have already paid for our room.

We booked three nights at Albergo Quirinale via Gate1 (bundled with airfare, breakfast buffet included) during a wet December (b/t Xmas and New Year). The hotel isn't the cheapest, but it is convenient, spacious and pretty, and the staff is nice and helpful (English-speaking, friendly and knowledgeable). Many of the amenities are, in fact, superb. There seems to be a lot of discussion about the \"four star/three star\" status of Quirinale on tripadvisor reviews here. Look--it's not a budget hotel, but few hotels in Rome are; however, if you get the unlimited breakfast buffett, you can stuff yourself with food and really work the location so you save and see everything (it's hard to get a better place of operations, esp with the ROMA Pass rail/bus savings). And you'll enjoy your time there. Do some research, though: Piazza della Repubblica is about 2 minutes by foot, so you can foot it to buses (the 910 for the Galleria Borghese), the 40 Express to the Vatican (stops two feet in front of the hotel, opposite side of Via Nazionale) and subway. The Baths of Diocletian and the National Museum can be walked to as well in about 5 mins. The main post office is three blocks away; ATMs/banks are plentiful on both sides of the street; Roma Termini is 10 minutes by foot to the south; Santa Maria della Vittoria, with Bernini's Ecstasy of St. Teresa (and other churches, including San Carlino delle Q.Fontane--all free) are about 10 minutes away. The Trevi is walkable, too, along with the Palazzo Barberini. ... If you need them, there are also magazine stands and vendors close by (but the hotel has English/international newspapers in lobby), and a small, charming supermarket down the road on the opposite side of street will furnish you with the rest of your needs. In terms of the hotel itself, it adjoins the Opera House (Verdi stayed there), and staff can tell you how to book tix for performances. You can expect the sculpture courtyard to be full of people in warm weather, and the Sala Verdi (where the buffet is served) to be packed in high season, but that's typical. Ditto for the restaurant (mid-range in terms of price, but delicious) and the bar. There's a postal drop by the desk for international/domestic mail, and the elevator works (the bathrooms by the lobby are also clean, and may also be handy for you--Italy's WC situation is, travel-wise, something to be aware of). It was still holiday-festive inside when we were there (Christmas tree, warm fire, music in the evenings), so summer may be very different in terms of atmosphere, etc. We were on the 5th Floor, and it was quiet, but there was some noise from a nearby room with a family for an hour or so (always bring earplugs on holiday). Room had a safe, very good windows, and a double door, and the beds (two twins pushed together, per Italian custom) had marquetry with pastoral scenes, as did the cabinets. TV was great (flatscreen, many channels), and the bathroom/shower worked perfectly well and was stocked and spacious (minibar ditto). Ask for an interior room (\"una camera tranquilla, interiore\") so you don't get one overlooking the noisy Via Nazionale. As with all services in Italy, a little Italian goes a long way in terms of help and friendliness. Note: in some reviews, you will hear that a hotel's \"AC shut off for the afternoon\" or that \"the heat didn't work for five hours!!!\" That's not the hotel's fault: that's Italy--by national law as an energy-saving measure, they shut off the heat/AC at times to save on power. A bit of research might alleviate this concern; so maybe if they bought a Rick Steves guide they'd save on stress before the trip, instead of spending more energy and time worrying when in Italy? Anyway, the Hotel Quirinale isn't the Four Seasons, but it has charm and is very convenient.

I didn't feel good about it and worried right up to arrival. My concerns were warranted. I still booked this hotel because I really wanted to stay in a hotel located around the center of Rome. There were definately better hotel options outside of Rome's center with better pricing, but I really wanted to be able to walk to all the major sights. The good. Location. Can't be beat. I was within walking distance to all the major sights. Despite other poor reviews, I found the service staff to be courteous and helpful. Many of the staff spoke english which was very helpful. The hotel overall was in good condition. Like one reviewer commented, it has potential to be great. Very happy with the bathroom. Modern and clean. Internet connection via ethernet cable.

Had no idea that single meant their tiny room with a twin sized bed. I felt claustrophobic. The booking through hotels.com wasn't cancellable at that point, so I didn't have the option of leaving and going to another hotel. I paid another 50 Euros/night to upgrade to the deluxe double room which was the size of an average hotel room in the states. The deluxe room had two twin beds. I never got used to sleeping in the small twin bed. And I'm only 5'4\" 130 lbs. The mattress was old and lumpy. I felt all the springs in the mattress. Slept with back pain the entire 6 nights of my stay. The springs seemed old. When I rolled to either side, the springs sank in and I felt like I was going to roll off. Also the door to the room hung crooked and wasn't sized right. There was a 2 inch gap in the bottom. The hall light floods in at night. Noise from the hallway is very loud when people walk by.

Breakfast had a great choice and was delicious. The reception itself consisted of drinks and snacks in the lovely garden, which was great for the kids and a lovely 4 course meal with a fabulous wedding cake in the sala verdi which was grand!

We were pleased to have avoided the bed of a previous review with the greasy headboard, but found instead a (higher than usual) hardwood antique that was it must be said, very comfortable. Air conditioning was noisy, but welcome, given that it was 29 degrees outside. Bathroom was very large and clean but in keeping with the traditional decor, unfortunately did NOT have a modern power shower. Street noise was noticeable even though we faced a side street. Breakfast was typically continental and the hot buffet was limited and fairly uninviting...decent coffee and juice though even if it was out of a machine!

It's true that the staff don't seem interested and don't go out of their way to be welcoming.

We were in a room overlooking the garden and it was very quiet with the shutters closed, I imagine if we had been overlooking the road at the front it would be noisier. We timed ourselves walking to the termini, it took 12 minutes at a comfortable pace. The breakfast is also important as it sets you up for the busy day ahead, contrary to other reviews, we were impressed with the choice, cereal,fruit, pastries or a good old cooked breakfast. We went to breakfast early (7.30) and later (9.30) each time the choice was plentiful and hot. We did the green line bus tour as it was a good way to get your bearings and you can get on and off at will.The full tour lasts approx 2 hours, you get given headphones with a selection of languages, a narrative explains the story behind the history as the bus passed by a particular venue. At the Colesseum, there are no information signs, we were approached and asked if we wanted to join a tour. It lasted approx 1 hour and we were given a leaflet about other tours that Romatours offered. We went on their Vatican tour the next day, it was well worth paying the extra just to walk past the people who'd been queueing for hours in the blazing hot sunshine. Our tour guide, Amanda, was enthusiastic and made it very interesting. We walked from the hotel to the Trevi Fountain, which was beautiful lit up in the evening, and threw in the required coins! This area had plenty of choice for restaurants and competitively priced, on average we paid 50 euros for a 2 course meal and wine for 2 adults which included a tip. We also experienced the metro, it's not unlike the tube in London, but they decide to close lines when there is no obvious alternative route.

Our wedding co ordinator, which we found ourselves through their website was the nicest person we have ever met, she helped us for months previous planning and hiring everything from start to finish. Her name was Elena and I have to praise her for her patience with us as we were very nervous leading up to our day asking so many questions!!!! All in all it was the best trip of our lives we flew onto the Maldives for our honeymoon and to be honest we were very upset leaving Rome and the hotel. If you are planning to have your wedding abroad we would highly recommend contacting this hotel their is nothing they would not help you with from the flowers to car hire from makeup and hairdressers to photography for the day.

We stayed as part of an independent package tour, and we chose an upgrade in hotel to the Quirinale. As a result, our peaceful, oversized room was in the back of the building, away from the street, with a large sitting area (sofa, coffee table, two chairs), a huge bathroom with double sink, whirlpool tub with shower, and bidet. Bed was king size (two twins pushed together). Decoration was Imperial style, quite formal, with lots of gilt and red satin upholstery. Room was very clean, with clean sheets and fresh towels each day. Air conditioning hadn't been turned on for the summer, so late each afternoon the room was at least 80 degrees, even with the window open. It cooled off at night, so we were fine. The included breakfast buffet was plentiful and offered lots of choices. In-room internet service was 8 euros an hour, while the internet point down a side street on the next block (5 minute walk) was only 1.50 euros for 30 minutes, a no-brainer for checking e-mail. Hotel staff were always pleasant and accommodating. There aren't a lot of budget restaurants in the immediate area, but about a 3-minute walk brings you to Target, with a full menu and decent pizza (as noted by Rick Steves in his Rome guide). We also tried the Irish pub a block from the hotel. It was good and open late, always very noisy, and quite busy at dinner time. Dagnini, a restaurant/bakery in a mini-mall about 2 blocks away, was good, inexpensive, and convenient, and Ristorante da Giovanni about 6 blocks away (10 minutes' walk) was excellent for a real homestyle Italian meal. The Quirinale is a good choice for reasonable accommodation near the train station, but it's at least a mile walk to Rome's most famous tourist destinations. It takes about 20 minutes to walk down the Via Nazionale. From there you'd branch off to get to the Trevi Fountain, the Piazza Navona, the Pantheon, Trastevere, the Vatican, etc. In future I'd want to stay closer to those neighborhoods to cut down on extra walking and to have more evening dinner options. The hotel offered a car service to the airport for 68 euro, a steep price, but we decided on that because we needed a 5:15 a.m. pickup. A regular taxi would probably have been substantially cheaper for the same trip.", "Date": "April 12, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "4", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "westchester", "Title": "\u201cNice.\u201d", "Author": "deenaclaire", "ReviewID": "UR4895793", "Content": "Location is good, not great.

My impression of this hotel is similar to others that have written also. After checking in we were take to our room which as I recall was on the 2nd floor. We immediately noticed that the beds were camp cots (NOT KIDDING). A single thin foam matress on a wire mesh base! The window sill met up with a flat tar roof where workers had been working and dumped all their trash into the window sill of this room. We asked to be moved to another room with real beds. We ended up somewhere near the basement...close to the cage lift. This room had 2 small double matresses and nothing else except a chair which had stains all over the seat...there was about 1 foot of space around the bed. The walls were covered in filth. Stains of various colors including something brown dripping down the ceiling from the room above. The window was some odd type of door with no lock on it to the outside. We went back to the reception area and spoke to the manager. They were able to move us to another room which was slightly cleaner then the last. We placed a call to our travel agent and placed a complaint against this hotel and asked to be moved to another hotel. We were unable to move to another hotel as we had already paid and we would not be reimbursed, we were on a tight budget and could not afford to cover the cost of another hotel for 4 days. The reception staff was rude and could have cared less about our concerns. The breakfast buffet was fair at best. While the entrance to the hotel lobby is pretty...the rooms that sit above are a different story. This hotel is also in a poor location for sightseeing.

First let me stay, Do Not Stay at the Hotel Quirinal in Rome. My family (4 adults and 2 children) spent 17 nights in Italy this past Summer. We started the trip with 1 week at a wonderful VRBO apartment in Rome then drove to just south of Florence for another wonderful 9 nights at the \"Poggio ai Merli\" villa while visiting all of Tuscany. It was the last night in Rome that had to be the worst experience any of us have ever had in all our years of traveling. On August 27th, 2005 we left Florence and arrived at the Hotel Quirinal about 11:00am. Hoping to enjoy our last day and night in Rome we ask to check in early. We didn't expect to be able to go to the rooms but just wanted to get the paper work done and get the keys for a later arrival. We were turned down but were allowed to put our luggage in their check room. We were okay with this since we understood that different hotels have different procedures. We left and had lunch and drove around visiting a few sites. When we returned a little after 2:00pm, the lobby was packed. We gladly waited our turn and when we finally were waited on, we were told that the 2 triple rooms we had reserved were not next to each other as we had requested but they were not even on the same floor. This was a problem since we had our 2 children. We tried to get a quad room and a double or just anything else to work out the problem. They had no other rooms. We nicely asked to cancel our reservations since they could not satisfy our needs and they refused. They said we would have to pay for the night anyway. This was just the start to the rude and nasty treatment we experienced from the staff. We decided to stay since it was only one night and they already had our credit card info. On the way to the rooms the two bell men fought with each other about who was taking us to our rooms. When we arrived at our rooms we could not believe how hot and mildew stinky they were. The rooms which were suppose to be triple, but were simply small double bedded rooms with cots pushed against the wall. Not only had we been forced to stay in the filthy, smelly rooms separated by many floors but the air conditioning didn't put out any air cooler than that of a small fan and we are accustomed to the air conditioning in Europe. The biggest complaint is this: I made our reservations 3 months in advance, requesting 2 adjoining triple rooms. I truly thought I had done my homework by checking out all the hotel review sites and most reviews with the exceptions of a very few were positive. The pictures of the rooms and the statements of this old hotel being newly refurbished were simply not true. I even asked the attendant at the desk while leaving, where were the rooms shown on the websites advertising the hotel because the two we had were nothing like this one and according to the advertisment pages the rooms at this hotel were all (all suite) rooms. This hotel is advertised as a 4 Star Hotel and I must say it should not qualify for any stars. Be warned, unless you want to stay in a filthy, stinky, Hot, misrepresented hotel with extremely rude and uncaring attendants, do not stay at the Hotel Quirinal. The good news: Our family has already booked this coming summer's holiday to travel for 3 weeks back to Italy and France and of course we will not be staying at the Hotel Quirinal.", "Date": "October 20, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "5.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Dublin, Ireland", "Title": "\u201cFantastic!\u201d", "Author": "bolognababe", "ReviewID": "UR4027094", "Content": "I had my wedding in the Quirinale in September 2005.

The room wasn't a bad size although there wasn't a seating area as other people have mentioned... there were twin beds and that was it. The beds themselves were also extremely rickety... not too dissimilar to camp beds. The window was also 5 foot up from the floor and looked out onto a window ledge level concrete 'garden'. At only 5'3'' myself, I struggled to open and close the windows and shutters and had to stand on a chair to do so. Unhappy with the room I spoke to the manager who assured me that this was an upgraded room due to the 'garden view' and that there was nothing else available. He sounded most put out that I would even be querying the status of the room and left me feeling extremely embarrassed for even having broached the subject. It is also worth noting that as per lots of Hotels the bar prices are extremely high. A tomato juice cost 8 euros and 9 if you wanted a dash of Worcester sauce in it! There are plenty of restaurants and bars close by though that offer reasonably good value for money so it was no hardship to eat and drink out.
