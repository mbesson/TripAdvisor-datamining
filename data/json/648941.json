The room was decorated lovely & very spacious for London Accommodation. Could not fault the breakfast at all with many choices, mine being full english. The only faults i could find & this is probably being picky is i could of done with a hand towel for my hair as you only got a bath towel, you have to keep windows shut at night as the traffic from the main road can be a little noisy but slept like a baby once shut. Would really recommend staying here to discover London as great value and friendly staff.

This judgement is based on the price I paid for the room in this area. Positives: The room itself was a decent enough size with an en-suite bath / shower. I have paid more for hotels with smaller rooms in the area. Room was nice and clean, which is top of my list of \"musts\". Tea/coffee are provided. Full english breakfast is provided and gets you off to a good start to the day Negatives: No soap in room, only shampoo (think this was an oversight). No hand towels or floor towels. No lift may cause a problem if you struggle with stairs. Pub downstairs was decent enough. One word of warning though...but nothing to do with the hotel. I parked in the NCP in the Hilton Olympia, approx 50m away. As I arrived at 6.30 PM I had a deal where it would cost \u00a311 to park if I left before 9AM. I got there at 9.15, and was told it would cost \u00a335!!!! It took the guy a phone call to reduce this to a more reasonable \u00a315. I will definitely stay in this hotel again, but will ensure I'm collecting my car before 9AM", "Date": "July 25, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "1", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Exeter, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cLooks great on the surface but scratch it and it reveals big weaknesses\u201d", "Author": "franlong", "ReviewID": "UR100930745", "Content": "Booked this as many of the reviews seemed ok and close to Olympia - up 2 very large flights of stairs and one of our party had a bad back. Would have been good to know access is for fit people only. First impressions on rooms (we had 4) was wow - this looks amazing - however on closer inspection it looked like they had spent a lot on the refurb and then not bothered with the day to day management of it. My towels were dirty - they smelt like they had been dried and not washed - that horrible unwashed towel smell. When I complained they said they did not understand as all towels went to the laundry. They did however change them. The beds were comfortable and the rooms are decorated very nicely. The bar staff were very pleasant. In Room 4 - you can't fully turn the hot tap on as it is too close to the wall and won't turn more than 90 degrees. In Room 3 half of the tap handles had fallen off and there was no plug in the sink. In room 2 - the bathroom is tiny and not really suitable for anyone who is larger than a size 12 Breakfast was very good but very slow - took 45 minutes from order to food - and there were only 6 of us so if you are in a hurry please be aware of this. The same chap was on duty from Thursday through to Saturday, when we left, and he spent the whole time looking sad and stressed. We were informed breakast was between 7 and 8 so Saturday morning we were all down for 7.50 and breakfast on a weekend is 8-9. They didn't tell us that. So if you need to stay here - be fit and slim - have the time to wait for breakfast and bring your own towels.", "Date": "March 21, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "2", "Service": "2", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "London, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cDisappointing Food and Service\u201d", "Author": "Mindless-in-London", "ReviewID": "UR84132230", "Content": "I took a friend who was travelling in London to this pub for lunch thinking its menu looks very appealing at the door, hoping it will become my local favorite too.

However, I was nowhere near as enamoured of this place as those who have given it four and five stars. It is most definitely a pub with some rooms, rather than a hotel. This became obvious when I arrived after a long journey and found the side door to the 'hotel' locked and no one answering the door bell. Eventually I went into the pub and waited to check in while several people were being served drinks. It was all rather off-putting and off-hand. A simple sign on the side door would have been useful. Food, including breakfast, was served in the bar, and although the space was light and airy, as a solo female traveller I just didn't feel comfortable eating dinner surrounded by male drinkers. There were also two screens showing the news, along with background music: all rather intrusive. Other reviews had warned about the number of stairs (78 - I counted!), which was fine, but it felt qutie remote being stuck at the top of the building. The room was quirky in a pleasing way, with its odd shape and old-fashioned furniture, but I ached to move items around to make it work better: a dressing table was stuck under in darkness under the cramped eaves while a chair sat in isolated splendour, for example. Again, the noise had been flagged up in advance, and indeed the TV could not be heard above the traffic if the windows were open, which they had to be as the weather was so warm. There was an attempt to give a 'boutique' feel to the decor, with fashionable wallpaper and colours, but actually it was quite shabby, surprising given the room was around \u00c2\u00a395 per night: part of a tap was missing until the last day, a light was badly fitted, the walls were scuffed, etc. If the price was lower, then this might have been acceptable, but I feel this place is pretending to be something it is not.", "Date": "June 30, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "London, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cTERRIBLE TERRIBLE HOTEL - ABSOLUTELY AWFUL MANAGEMENT\u201d", "Author": "Rachel12348", "ReviewID": "UR68245060", "Content": "Staff were simply RUDE and very unhelpful!!!!

Comfortable bed and great pillows which is rare in most hotels including those costing a lot more. We were made to feel welcome on arrival.

Room very odd mix of dark old fashioned dressing table and attempt at more modern artwork on walls. One wardrobe door had no handle and the doors had to be kept shut using piece of folded card (already supplied) but was spacious enough (take your own coathangers) - bathroom door didn't stay shut - hole in ceiling where they'd fitted spot lights and then decided to move one - bathroom taps each had one 'prong' missing and no top to the plug release - overhead shower couldn't be adjusted at all and didn't work very well however is a second one (for washing hair?) that was brilliant and powerful (but you just had to hold it) - road is noisy but not that bad during the night and you soon get used to it anyway, just don't expect a long quiet lie in the next morning - reading this makes it sound a bit negative however we will probably stay there again next year - bed was so comfortable and the place was clean which are the main things - the rest you just need to laugh at and move on - food was pretty good but we made the mistake of trying to eat the first night about 6.30 - place was packed and couldn't get a seat but next night by 7.15 it was semi empty again - seems everyone leaves olympia after the trade show and goes straight in for a drink! - there is a pizza express across the road which was very quiet and food was great. Staff were very friendly and breakfast was great - said it was served from 7 to 9 so should suit most people. Only other problem was that the dressing table was in front of the heater so it didn't give out much heat when it worked but didn't work some of the time as well - we fortunately packed fleecy dressing gowns so it wasn't a problem. Nice touches - there was ear plugs by the bed and also a bottle of water each (new one each day no matter how much you'd used), 4 coffee, 2 tea, 1 horlicks, 1 chocolate drink and 2 packs of biscuits along with sugar and milk/cream.

Room disappointing - once you leave the bar area the staircase up to rooms is very rough and ready - needs a new carpet and paint job! My room was on toip floor - seriously high staircase! I know I booked a single but you couldn't swing a cat! Bed was hidden in alcove with no headboard and couldn't see anything as no light in that part of the room. Room a strange mix of old and new style. Bit of a botch job. In contrast, the bathroom , tho also small was fitted out beautifully. I believe the larger double rooms are much better from colleagues.
