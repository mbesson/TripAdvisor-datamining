We booked the hotel on lastminute.com as one of their Top Secret hotel offers and in discovering the name of our accommodation were initially a bit worried after reading some very average reviews, however the Wyndham Apollo was an extremely pleasant surprise! It was a first time in Amsterdam for both of us and so we were slightly concerned that the hotel was a bit far from the city centre, however the reception staff were fantastic and provided us with a map and an explanation of where to find the nearest tram stop for trams 5 and 24 which would take us into the centre and back again. Our offer from lastminute.com was room only and we were very happy with this as there was both a petrol station and a supermarket nearby where we could purchase things for breakfast - our room was also supplied with tea and coffee making facilities! I absolutely loved this hotel and thought it was fantastic value for money; the decor is beautiful, particularly in the bar/lounge area and foyer. When we arrived we were very impressed with the look of the hotel, the efficiency and friendly nature of the staff and the fact that it even smelled wonderful! Our room was perfect - purple in colour, comfortable beds, clean sheets and towels every day and a spotlessly clean bathroom. We didn't have a view of the canals or marina but to us that didn't matter because we spent so much time walking around and seeing the sights of Amsterdam that we mainly used our room for sleeping, getting ready and then going again. We did spend one evening in the bar/lounge area before heading to our room and it was so lovely - very comfortable, warm and a fantastic, relaxing atmosphere. The hotel was not noisy or crowded despite having a car park full of cars. I would 100% definitely stay in this hotel again. It may appear to be quite a distance away from the centre of Amsterdam but it is so easy to get around using trams, plus the area in which the hotel is situated is absolutely lovely (lots of nice clothes shops for ladies, and also a wonderful Argentine restaurant called Gauchos which does excellent steaks). It is within walking distance to the Museum Quarter and it's also easy to get to and from the Schiphol airport - take the train from Schiphol to Zuid station and get the number 65 bus to Stadionweg and it's a 5 minute walk to the hotel door! Do not listen to the negative reviews about this hotel - I cannot fault my stay at all and honestly have no idea why so many people have complained, except that they just love a good moan! Thank you to Wyndham Apollo - you made our first trip to Amsterdam so perfect that we didn't want to leave and I will definitely be back!", "Date": "April 17, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Ireland, Co.

The hotel had been advertised as central and modern, but in reality was neither. Luckily, two days before I had emailed the hotel to request a non-smoking room, only to be told that they did not have my reservation. After much panicking and email checking our room was re-booked - not a good start. Upon arrival (after a train and tram ride, followed by a 10 minute walk) we arrived at the hotel, which was by no means in the centre of things. The foyer and lobby area was well presented, and we were greeted by staff. Upon checking in to our room, we were asked for a 100 euro deposit as security for the room - given the short amount of time we were staying (2 nights) we didn't really have that amount of euros to spare, and had purposefully prepaid the room. I asked if I could leave 50 euros instead as I had no intention of using any of the mini bar/room services - the man at reception laughed at me and said I had to pay 100 euros. After much arguing we were allowed to leave a 50 euro deposit (which was then subject to 40 euros city tax which we thought was included in the room price). The room itself was tired and dated...we had been given a ground floor room which was basically part of the entrance, meaning we had to have the curtains drawn almost all the time so people couldn't look directly into our room. The beds were reasonably comfortable, and seemed to be clean - though the room did have a slightly damp/musty smell to it. For the price I paid, I would have expected either prime location, or a well appointed room - but I got neither.

I was checked in by a great concierge, who could not find my reservation, but kept reassuring me there would be no problem. He gave me a nice room on the ground floor and that was just the beginning of a great stay. Nice view over a canal, very functional and modern room, good bed, nicely appointed bathroom (adult size and with two soap bars!), good size safe in the wardrobe, everything impeccably clean and in nice working order. Catering for the meeting I attended was very good, timely, different from day to day, no obvious recycling of buffet dishes, friendly and polite service. Check out was fast and efficient.

I spend my first of two nights in a room in the basement of the hotel just below the water level. Apart from it being claustrofobic, the room only had a bed that folds down from the wall (like the one used in comedies). As the hotel was fully booked, they could only offer me an alternative for the second night. When I return the next night, the access to my room was disabled requiring me to go back to the reception to find out that I had change rooms. I then had to go back to the old room again to get my luggage and find my way to the new, upgraded, room. This room was somewhat better, but still in need of refurbishment.

I would normally give this hotel 4 out of 5 as the rooms are clean and have everything required - however i did feel ripped off by some of the additional charges. Wifi was 50 Euros for 4 days! Luckily I checked before logging on so went for the 1 hour option - in a business hotel not to have access to free WiFi in some part of the hotel is really poor customer service. Travelling alone I often opt for room service, however at 10 Euro tray charge this made it a very expensive option. I decided to go for the Chefs Choice menu of 35 Euro in the main dining room.

Breakfast is good - with the added entertainment of the breakfast waiters who have a good rapport going with both staff and customers. These guys actually made my stay!

The neighbourhood of the hotel is nice, quiet and safe but it does cost 15 euros to get to/from the city centre (at night time when there is no public transport). The hotel has a nice exterior and reception but our deluxe room was tired, with patches of torn carpet, very outdated bathroom that must be a struggle to keep clean and shiny (so it was not shiny at all, although it was not dirty, just very tired-looking, e.g. acrylic bathtub past it use-by date, permanent stains on the marble, etc). It was kind of a room where you do not want to walk barefoot on the carpet and you do get the urge (at least i did) to wash your hands from time to time. Once again, I do think it is clean enough there, just not easy to maintain the sparkly clean look in a well worn-out place.The bed was very comfortable, long and wide, and not too firm. The staff at the reception was quite responsive, esp. the concierge, and whilst I don't consider it extraordinary, it was nice. The thing we appreciated was the opportunity to get the tickets to Van Gogh museum right before heading there - with no premium charged.... We did not try the breakfast given previous reviews, plus there are a couple of bakeries next to the tramline where you can have a nice continental breakfast...Overall, I have no complaints about the hotel but i think it should not be advertised as \"top hotel\" by lastminute, so my grudges are to lastminute.com, not to Wyndham.

So my girlfriend booked our hotel via lastminute.com as a secret hotel (this was a surprise for me as we have just got engaged). We got to the hotel early, around 10am and were told a room wasnt available, which we expected and was fine. Our luggage was put in the hold room and we went off into town. The tram stop is around 5 mins (max) away from the hotel and we were waiting no longer than 3 minutes at any time for a tram. The trams take less than 10 minutes to get into the town and you get to see some of the outskirts of Amsterdam, which are lovely. If we stayed in the centre we would have never seen De Pijp, which is a very cool area with bars, cafes, a street market etc. So the tram and distance is no real issue at all unless you enjoy whinging and need to find something to whinge about. After a lovely day in Amsterdam we returned around 6pm. We had a lovely room on the 6th floor overlooking the canal junction. There was also a complimentary bottle of Prosecco to congratulate us on our engagement - a very nice touch. We checked in with a lady called Rosana (i think!) who was very nice. The room was lovely, spacious and clean. Before knowing there was a bottle of Prosecco in our room we had bought a bottle ourselves to have in the room while getting ready - so on our way up to the room for the first time we went into the bar and asked for an ice bucket and glasses - which were given to us with a smile.

It's in the suburbs, and the view isn't nearly that great. We got a ground floor room looking onto the carpark - nice. The rooms are clean, but they aren't into details. There were two of us in the room - and they didn't leave enough glasses/mugs for us both! For 100e a night I'd like a glass each! And they don't restock the toiliteries during your stay. So when you run out of their tiny bottles of shampoo, you might have a problem. Checkin/out was a hassle. Checking in - had to wait ages for the receptionist to get off the phone. She also forgot to mention the room tax we'd have to pay when we left- not so professional. Check out - there was a massive queue. Waiting in it really messed up our last morning in the city. For such a soul-less and corporate hotel - you'd have thought they'd discovered express checkouts! In short, this place if fine, if you're not after frills or a warm and pleasant experience.

The hotel has a nice restaurant and one evening my wife and I decided to have the set 3 course menu, the chef sent out a few little extra things along the way and I must say everything was presented very well and tasted delicious. I would recommend that you eat inside - smokers in Holland are just as inconsiderate as smokers everywhere else and if you are a non-smoker you stand a good chance of having someone light up because they have just finished their meal even though you may just be starting yours. Holland has adopted the same type of legislation as the UK in regards to smoking inside public buildings, so \"inside\" is smoke free. The room we were allocated did need some redecoration but this is true of almost every hotel in the world unless its in the first 12 months of being open. The constant 24 hour stream of human traffic takes it toll on any hotel. Do ask for a refurbished room as the hotel is in a cycle of refurbishment, but our room was clean and they serviced it whilst we were at breakfast. The hotel staff were friendly and very helpful - I even got a knock on the door one evening by the desk staff to make sure that everything was OK and that my request had been dealt with to my satisfaction. (I had asked about booking breakfast as I had not done this at the time of my original booking). To get into Amsterdam Central take the 24 or 5 Tram. These are accessed from the tram stops by coming out of the hotel and taking a walk of no more than 5 minutes down towards the end of Gerrit van der Veerstraat. When you come to the junction look to the right and you will see the Tram Stop in the central reservation. The ride to the centre of Amsterdam will take no more than 7 - 8 minutes. The tram numbers are on little cards on one end of the tram stop about 7ft up towards the roof covering. If you want to to be able to pronounce your street names and to be able to read them easily - stay at home - forget the rest of the world exists and don't ever try to have a sense of adventure. If you have a nokia phone use the free OVI GPS mapping system to navigate yourself around. You can leave the application on all day (like I did on my C5-00) without any perceptible battery drain! Simple and outstandingly effective. Whilst I have read some of the comments about this hotel, there is little I can identify with - there will always be the professional moaners who insist the hotel is a waste of time because a small bar of soap was unavailable on the day they arrived or that car parking was expensive (Try Statford-upon-Avon in the UK - its the place where Shakespeare was born - the Multi Storey car park there is \u00c2\u00a35.50 an hour =150 euros a day). If you really need and demand 5* service (or you have a 5* attitude) - go to a 5* hotel and pay the appropriate rate. I would stay here again and look forward to doing so - its peaceful, well away from the stag and hen parties in Amsterdam central, the rooms are clean, you get a good nights sleep on comfortable beds, the food is good and the staff are friendly and helpful. What more do you want? Oh - one more thing. If arriving by train from Schipol Airport - don't go to central and then tram it or bus it - instead go to Amsterdam Station Zuid. This is just 10 minutes walk by coming out onto Minervalaan then onto Stadionkade and from there straight onto Bernard Zweerskade.

My friend and I actually planned to stay here last minute for New Year's, and we could't have gotten a better place to stay. First of all, the staff at this hotel were the nicest and most helpful people I have ever met in a hotel setting. Every time we would walk into the lobby each one would greet us with a smile and ask how our day was. They were also eager to help out with suggestions of things to do and see while in Amsterdam and great directions. One staff member even took out a map and drew on it for me circling where points of interest were and the tram ways that we would need to take to get there. The hotel itself is absolutely beautiful! The location is perfect, not right in the city center but not too far from everything either. The lobby was so warm and welcoming. There was a warm fire next to the bar we cuddled up to one night with a few glasses of wine provided a very relaxing, sophisticated environment after a busy day of sightseeing. Our guest room was one of the best I had ever stayed in throughout all of my European travels. It was quite spacious and the view overlooking the area where about five canals meet was incredible, I felt I was looking at a postcard when I looked out my window. The bed was comfy and cozy. The bathroom was spacious as well with pretty sparkling marble floors. All in all, our experience at the Wyndham Apollo was amazing to say the least!

Apparently this had affected quite a few guests as well as ourselves as there were quite a few people milling around the reception area. Despite having my booking ref the guy at reception told me that they had no rooms available & were sending people to another hotel for the night while they sorted the rooms out. I then produced an email I'd received from the hotel just the day before confirming my reservation after I'd emailed them in advance of our arrival. I always do this now as an extra confirmation after a previous experience of booking through a website & discovering the hotel didn't have my reservation upon arrival. The guy took my email & disappeared off out the back to discuss it with his colleagues, then a couple of minutes later he was back and hey presto! turns out they did have rooms available after all and they offered us one. I don't know who was to blame for this, whether it was lastminute.com or the hotel, but the fact that they were turning people with reservations away & telling them they were full when they had rooms available after all was very dodgy indeed! The manager then called us when we were in the room and apologised, stating that we should never have been asked to leave in the 1st place. I hope they extended that apology to all the other people they did turn away, because it was only the email confirmation that I had the foresight to get that prevented us being moved too. The room itself was fine. Nice & clean. Recently refurbished, though the bathroom didn't look to have been. Flush on the toilet was weak and big gap under shower door means water gets all over the floor. The staff were all polite, with the exception of the gruff & unsmiling concierge. Location is in a lovely suburb. Not particularly close to the centre, but only a 15 min tram ride from the nearby apollolaan stop.

First impressions are impressive, as you walk into an elegant, large lobby which looks definitely in keeping with its 4 star rating. However, that was far and away the best part of the hotel. We were allocated a room on the ground floor, facing the canal. The room was incredibly dated - the mirror was stained with what looked like paint, there were water mark stains on the ceiling of the main room and the bathroom had no hand soap at all. We asked for some soap, only to be told that the hotel had run out and we should use the hair/body shower gel to wash our hands with instead. Very classy. The television in the room was probably a good 5 years old plus, and the alleged interactive features failed to work at all - no internet through the TV, nor movies on demand etc. It all felt like it was about 2000, not 2011, and felt like a poor three star hotel - nowhere near a four star. The only clues that it was a four star hotel were the lobby and, unfortunately, the prices. I cannot believe that a four star hotel fails to provide free wireless in this day and age, but the Wyndham Apollo doesn't and instead looks to charge a fortune for even short access. Needless to say, we didn't bother paying the inflated prices, nor the silly prices for food and drink in the hotel. It's also a good 35/40 minute walk out of the centre, or about 15 minutes by tram.

We were not disappointed. We have booked TSH three times now so were not too worried. We did our research and knew the hotel was not centrally located but had good links into town (about 10/15 mins on the tram). Walking is also possible - about half an hour to the centre. The hotel is about 8/10 mins walk from the museum quarter so that was good for us. Distance from airport - 20 mins on the train to Amsterdam Centraal and then tram ride - 15 mins. Hotel is 5 mins walk from the tram stop, a little less if you are a fast walker! The hotel looked nice from the outside with views of canals, houses and a Shell petrol station (good for getting waters/drinks/snacks). We arrived at about 10.30am and were told our room would not be available till 2/3pm. We were allowed to check in and our bags put in the safe area so we were free to go into the city and wander around. We came back to the hotel about 4.30pm and were given a room on the 6th floor facing the canal! The room was beautiful. Newly refurbished in lime green/black/white colours. A nice comfy bed, AC, extra blankets & pillows, a mini bar (we were allowed to put our own things into it), flat screen tv, desk, nice clean bathroom with gorgeous toiletries! The windows were nice and big. We were very happy with it. The room was cleaned spotlessly each day. We did not have breakfast at the hotel as we thought it a little expensive at 22\u00e2\u201a\u00ac pp. You can get reasonable meals at places in the centre (wraps, omelettes, pancakes etc). Restaurants are expensive but there are many fast food/sandwich type places to eat. The average meal is around \u00c2\u00a316 and we were mostly spending about 25\u00e2\u201a\u00ac for the two of us for lunch and dinner cost us almost 50\u00e2\u201a\u00ac! We only had dinner on 2 nights. We opted for brunch and a late lunch instead of 3 meals a day. We did not have any issues with the service. Receptionists were polite. We drank all the tea/coffee one of the afternoons so next morning we had nothing to drink. I went into the corridors and found a cleaner. Told her we needed some tea/coffee/milk. She handed me a handful of stuff!! No questions asked. Overall a pleasant stay. On the day we checked out, we kept our luggage at the central station lockers (very secure and safe - about 7\u00e2\u201a\u00ac for 24 hrs for the big locker) so we were free to do things and get back to the station to catch the train to the airport. We enjoyed our trip. Found eating out a little expensive for the qualify of food so be careful where you eat and what. Lots to see and do and lots of walking so comfy shoes are a MUST. Train from aiport to city costs 3.70\u00e2\u201a\u00ac one way. Try to get a tram pass for 24/48/72h in advance. SOmetimes the drivers claimed they only had 1h cards, which are a rip off!

The last time we visited was about 18 months ago in October 2009. The first time we visited, we had an early morning flight so arrived in Amsterdam at about 9am. We were absolutely shattered and despite knowing that we couldn't check in to the hotel until 3pm, we thought we'd chance it and headed straight there. We caught a taxi at the airport and this will cost you between 40 and 45 euros. It's not bad really as it is about a 20 minute drive from the airport. When we got there, we asked the Receptionist if there was any chance of checking in a bit earlier i.e. maybe about 12ish and we couldn't believe our luck when she said they already had a room sorted for us and could check in straight away, at no extra cost may I add! We didn't have to worry about it this time round though as we opted for an afternoon flight and got to the hotel at 5pm. Each visit has been perfect and I really cannot fault this hotel. Service is brilliant, the reception staff, bar staff, and even the cleaners smile at you and always say 'hello'. They make you feel at home and are always happy to help. The lady in the bar, Mieke, was very friendly and would always tell us to grab a table and she would bring your drinks to you. It's a very clean and modern hotel, the rooms have loads of space and the beds are the comfiest beds I have ever slept in. When I checked out in Oct 09, I even asked the Receptionist where they got their beds from! The only down side is that it is very expensive, as are most hotels to be honest. Me and my Partner never had breakfast at the hotel as it's 12.50 euros just for a couple of croissants and 22.50 euros for a full breakfast. If you wanted room service then it was an extra 10 euros service charge. Therefore we would just venture into the city centre for a bite to eat. As can be expected, the mini-bar in the room is also very expensive i.e. 7 euros for a small pot of mixed nuts and 40 euros for a small bottle of bubbly. There is a Shell Petrol Station just round the corner from the hotel, so we would just get some drinks and snacks from there and keep them in our room. Location of the hotel is good and is situated within a quieter region of the city, therefore ideal for a romantic getaway. It's then just a short tram ride into the centre which costs 2.60 euros per person and this is valid for an hour, so you can hop on and off as many trams as you like within this period. Me and my Partner have had two great stays at this hotel and I would highly recommend to all couples out there who want to experience the hustle and bustle of Amsterdam, but want to wake up and go to sleep in peace. If you want to stay in a hotel closer to the centre, then you have to accept that it is probably going to be noisy in the evenings as there is always lots going on.

It's also a 10 minute walk from the Rijksmuseum and the Van Gogh Museum. We enjoy walking about to get to know the city so we didn't use public transport, but there seemed to be plenty of trams passing us on the way to the city centre. We had read some of the Tripadvisor reviews about the poor condition of the rooms that had not been refurbished. So we asked someone in the hotel if our booking was for a refurbished room using the excellent chat service on the apollohotelsresorts.com website. Our contact was very helpful - she told us that this could not be guaranteed, but we could upgrade to a canal view refurbished room for \u00e2\u201a\u00ac25 per night. We ended up taking our chances. When we arrived (by taxi from Schipol, roughly \u00e2\u201a\u00ac35) we had been upgraded to a refurbushed canal view room. Result. The hotel is on a junction of 5 canals and is directly across from the local rowing club, so there was always something going in the water when you looked out the window (all very peaceful I should add, although the odd musical barge went past early in the evening). The room was excellent - a fair size, fine decor, Van Gogh style prints, leather chair and footrest to unwind on, plus a minibar which was a normal fridge and not one of these sensor-triggered jobs that charges you if you move a can of beer. The only complaint we had was with the bed - the sheets didn't seem to fit properly, and when we woke up they had ridden up and were gathered in the middle of the bed. No big deal but the only real complaint we had. Staff were all very pleasant, the concierge was very helpful on our departure. We did not have meals or drinks at the hotel.

According to our booking, check-in was at 2pm but we arrived at 12pm so waited in reception. 2pm came though and we were then told by reception that their official check-in time was 3pm.

Upon check-in I requested whether it would be possible for a room upgrade as I was booked on a first floor room and knew that I was staying in this hotel for 7 nights and paying circa US $2300 total. After some searching, the very nice gentleman at the reception said he was able to secure me an upgraded room on the 5th floor with a balcony - which I eagerly took. Upon entrance to the floor, I was met with a large stain in front of the elevator. Obviously not the best omen. I entered the hotel room, which according to the fire escape chart was smaller than other rooms, but I discovered I had a large balcony which was quite an unexpected surprise and made up for the space. However, the room itself in no way shape or form matched the website pictures, the furniture was very run down which ample chips and cracks, the gold lounge chairs (which, while very comfy) had numerous stains all over them, the side table was wobbly with large cracks and plastic peeling off it, the tub had black mildew stains in the caulking, and somehow the toilet also had stains leading all the way into the bowls bottom. Overall, not a pleasant sight. On the plus side, the bed seemed comfortable. So, I called down to reception, and requested a room that matched the website pictures. The receptionist asked which website did I use, as the pictures were not representative of the rooms available. I told her I used the Wyndham website. She said that the pictures used were put up by Wyndham as stock photos. Then I inquired whether there were any rooms which had been renovated, and she tartly stated that she noticed I had already been upgraded to a larger room, but that if I absolutely wanted a smaller room which had the same view, but no balcony, but had been renovated that I could pay an additional 30 euros for one. Thanks, but no thanks - especially if the room might or might-not match the pictures on the website. In prior trips to Amsterdam, I have stayed at the Hotel Okura, which is nearby the Wyndham, and the Park Hotel and Renaissance Amsterdam hotels downtown.

First of all, for a five star hotel, we expected a lot so we may be a bit more critical than we would be for a 3 star but that being said, the hotel in general was very comfortable. It is not near the main hubs of Amsterdam but we didn't mind taking the tram and having to walk. We were adventuresome when we arrived and rather than take the 35 euro taxi from the Central train station, we finally found the right tram (number 24) and rode to the Apollean stop. We had to ask for directions and then walk for about 10 minutes but did arrive for only 5.60 euro for both! (Would be a nightmare if you had a lot of luggage!) Our room was very good size, a nice bed and very clean! We had read about old rooms verses newly decorated and frankly, I am not sure what ours was. There was purple everywhere - carpet, paneling, paint but it wasn't obnoxious--again, very clean and very large compared to everything else on our trip. It felt like an American hotel in Amsterdam. Here are the minor complaints. We would expect a five star hotel to replenish the shampoo/body wash stuff every day. They didn't and by day 3, they were gone. Although they provided a nice tea pot, after day 1, they did not replenish the creamer or the sugar--and only one tea bag the last day. I hated the pillows - too bulky and huge but hubby liked them. Also, the internet was an issue. Only one device can be used per room and we were advised that they were beginning to charge starting November 22. Again, a 5 star, one would think, would provide free internet services. Note of caution: if the shower head sprays on the small glass door, you can have a minor bathroom flood! Our room deal included the breakfast buffet and when we went to check in, I mentioned this to the desk person who looked very skeptical. I pulled out my iPad, showed him the reservation confirmation from Last Minute, which he then had to take to show his manager. She then confirmed that it was included but we felt like we would not have been \"believed\" had I not had the iPad confirmation. The breakfast buffet was FANTASTIC! There is so much food, the service was outstanding and it really was great to have this to start our three days. Our flight left early on the last day so we had to be there right at 630 and eat fast but the staff was accommodating and we were really glad to have the option. Wyndham Apollo is a nice place, not a typical European joint at all but after a long trip, we were pleased to have the comforts at the end of our honeymoon.

We were exhausted and eager to get into our rooms to freshen up and/or nap. But we were told that check-in time was an inflexible 3:00 PM and that we should \"walk around the City\" for six hours, until our rooms were ready. A few of us almost collapsed at this news. Some had made prior arrangements to see the Anne Frank House and so they were able to make use of the time. However most of us felt at loose ends. We were told we were not entitled to the free breakfast on this first day of our stay (although the ample breakfast buffet was included for subsequent days). We went into the adjunct dining room, hoping we could get a coffee and a roll, something to enliven us a little. There, the very supercillious maitre de informed us that we had to order a minimum of $10 E. per person - the price of a croissant and a demitasse of coffee. This self-important overseer of the dining area later warmed up to us though and allowed us to spend just $10 E per table rather than per person. He became generally more affable. But this did little to buck us up. After the croissant and coffee, most of us wandered, fatigued and droopy to the nth degree. Since the Hotel is far on the outskirts of Amsterdam, it was difficult to walk to the downtown area, although some connections with public transit were available within a few blocks. We made the best of it, trudging around town, getting as far as the Concert Hall and the Van Gogh Museum in central Amsterdam - although we were far too tired to take in either of these. We got back to the Hotel early and hung around the lobby until our rooms were ready. Then, when I REALLY needed to rest, I found I had another time-consuming ordeal ahead of me. My roommate and I found that we had been assigned a room with a single, very constricted bed. Since she and I were virtual strangers to each other, this seemed like it would crowd us into an unacceptable level of togetherness. We asked to be transferred to a room with twin beds. This caused a lengthy further delay. We were finally accommodated in what the hotel concierge said was the Hotel's \"last room with twin beds.\" So we had to make do. But again, we found the situation less than ideal. By \"twin,\" this Hotel meant beds considerally narrower than what the average American considers a \"twin.\" Although the beds were clean and the mattresses comfortable enough, these beds were more the size of Army cots. In her deep sleep, my roommate rolled clear out of her bed and crashed to the floor in the middle of our first night there. Luckily, she didn't injure herself. Then, we couldn't fathom the shower. It was an odd arrangement with a partially-bending plexiglass screen covering half the tub. This screen just seemed to serve to deflect the water all over the floors and ceiling of the entire bathroom. So we had to mop up before we could finally, finally get into bed. There were positives about the Hotel though. Almost all the staff members spoke perfect English, and they were very friendly and accommodating when it came to helping us make up for any lapses in our packing. For example, my roommate had not brought the proper converters or transformers to make her curling irons work. The Hotel brought up the proper additional equipment on loan - in the middle of the night and at dawn again, without even requesting a deposit from her. The Hotel was in a nice setting. Its back door and patio overlooked one of the loveliest turns in Amsterdam's canal systems. The wharf adjacent to the Hotel was blooming with red geraniums. In the front of the Hotel, in its parking lot, there was a lovely oasis that included a pond stocked with a variety of interesting fish. This parkland oasis included a bench where the weary traveler could rest and relax. Then when we were allowed the free breakfast the next morning, we found it to be sumptuous and delicious - with an unlimited supply of American-style coffee available. There was one omission on their buffet breakfast menu though. When a member of our group asked for \"oatmeal\" - the server looked perplexed and finally, apparently having misunderstood, brought her a pitcher of \"hot milk.\" It was the only lapse in communication we experienced while we were there.

There is also no in-room wifi and time online is very expensive.", "Date": "July 26, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Dubai, United Arab Emirates", "Title": "\u201cnot that bad\u201d", "Author": "uk2dubai", "ReviewID": "UR72174158", "Content": "not really located in the centre, but still a comfortable walk from most interesting sights.. excellent rooms, very comfrotable beds. best of all is to get a room facing the canals, you dont need a tv with that view... have been at better hotels, but for an old european city, this is really not bad, also excellent value for money. advise, skip the overpriced hotel breakfast, take a brisk walk towards rijksmuseum, and there are lots of alternatives with better breakfast offers, and this goes for quality as well as price", "Date": "July 24, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "2", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Sweden", "Title": "\u201cOkay but I've stayed at better 4-star hotels\u201d", "Author": "brightsunhere", "ReviewID": "UR70938338", "Content": "The room was okay.

It was incredibly disgusting. I went to the reception desk to complain and they switched me to another room. However, instead of apologizing or trying to make it better in any way (free breakfast - anything!), they irritably told me that they were giving me another room and that should resolve the issue, what else do I want them to do. I of course checked out of the hotel the following morning, at which point they tried to charge me for the following night as well because I didn't give them 24 hours notice of cancellation! I told them moving rooms at 2 a.m. due to an insect infestation was my 24 hours notice, but it required a long conversation with the manager to get the extra night fee off my bill.

The staff at reception were friendly and polite and gave us a map of the area etc when we checked in. Unfortunately we were sent to a room witha double bed instead of two singles as requested and the bed was unmade and beer cans were left out. However, after complaining we were moved to another room. the new room was fairly spacious but we did notice that it was VERY dusty and the decor was very outdated and old. I wouldnt say that the rooms were of 4 star standard (although I understand that rooms in Amsterdam can be v small and dingy so maybe it could be compared to those.

The hotel is a pleasant 10 minute walk from Museumplein, or a 10 minute tram ride to Dam Square, so, while the hotel isn't at the heart of the action, it's close enough to have a great night out and then be able to get some sleep, unlike in some hotels in the city centre.
