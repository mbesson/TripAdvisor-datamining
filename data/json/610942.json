That is about the best thing I can say about this hotel. Staff are rude, unhelpful and I would even go so far as to say aggressive. The hotel is split over 2 floors, there is no lift service to the upper floor. I was shouted at by a female member of staff when I enquired if there was a lift. Don't expect any help with your bags either! Breakfast not included in the price of the room. We didn't have breakfast in the hotel - didn't want to risk being shouted at again! There are plenty of places to get breakfast nearby. Dining area is very small, almost on top of the reception desk. Looks like it can can accommodate up to about six people at one time.I certainly wouldn't stay in this hotel again.", "Date": "Sep 16, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR423194921", "Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "1", "Overall": "1", "Value": "1", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "c0rk123"}, {"Content": "Not so charming The strong smell of urine that greeted us as we entered the building of the hotel was our first clue that the Hotel Annabella was not quite up to par. Our room was dim and dreary, and the beds felt more like military cots than beds. The shower was nothing more than a curtain in the corner of the bathroom with a drain in the middle of the tiled floor. Even better, the clerk who checked us in was a bit antisocial and pretty creepy. While this hotel is conveniently located within walking distance from the train station, I would not recommend the hotel. We checked out two hours after checking in in hopes of finding a more tolerable smelling hotel.", "Date": "Jul 2, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR560406197", "Ratings": {"Service": "-1", "Business service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "1", "Overall": "1", "Value": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "2"}, "Author": "sanderelly"}, {"Content": "Good one night stopover       Double room with balcony.Annabella", "Date": "Mar 6, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR576001510", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "4", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "KevanGoodworth"}, {"Content": "Clean Rooms, Great Location but poor customer service Srilal , AustraliaHotel Annabella is situated in a decent area very close to SMN station.

The location is excellent, just a short walk from the station. We stayed for one night and the room was of a decent size but the bathroom was rather small. We did breakfast on our own, there are several restaurants nearby.The main problem was that the heating was not adequate and the room was very cold. When I tried phoning the reception to turn up the heat the lady strode into my room, grabbed my hand and stuck it against the radiator, yelling that it was hot enough and that she could do no more and walked off.The staff spoke halting but adequate English. An adaptor for the electric plug was provided after several attempts and we were allowed to keep our bags in the storage room after checking out in the morning because our train was in the evening.Overall the hotel is conveniently located and the room was clean but cold.

I booked the place primarily because of its proximity to the train station. Its less than 5 mins walk. U come out of the station, cross the street at the traffic light, turn right, and when u get to the intersection, do a left. Keep walking till you see the chinese restaurant, and then do a left again. Do keep on walking 50 metres till the 2nd building. Its on the 3rd floor and you have to take a century-old elevator up.Save 10 euros and skip the breakfast. From what I see, it is uninspiring and you are better off getting a brioche on the street.I also found one male employee unfriendly. It is probably the same guy which another traveller met. The night watchman and the middle-aged lady are friendly.Dont count on getting a reliable map either from this hotel. Queue up at the travel office at the station and get one for 1 euro.It has decent and clean rooms, good location, reasonable price...and that's it.", "Date": "Sep 9, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR501006805", "Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "3", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "pepp205"}, {"Content": "Great room and value, though one key staff guy is unfriendly We really enjoyed our stay at Hotel Annabella, but only because of the free parking (you have to ask for a pass to put in your windshield so you can park in the street out front), the very nice room, and the good location in Florence. However, there is a guy who is one of the major employees there that was very unconcerned and apparently uninterested in the guests' enjoyment of the experience, unfortunately. The breakfast was REALLY uninspired; although coffee was very good since it was hand-made, yogurts were unsealed/opened, service was lacking and things were not fresh or high quality. This said, I'd still stay there again anytime for the nice, new room with hundreds of TV channels, cool A/C, and the excellent location relative to il centro (e il Duomo) di Firenze.", "Date": "Jul 20, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR141773292", "Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Business service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "2", "Overall": "4", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "oliz"}, {"Content": "Good price, location and room size.

All of our places panned out except the Pensione Ferretti, which we booked and stayed at before this place. What a mistake. They charged $65 euro a night for a room that was dirty, musky, took us 10 minutes to get into our room because of the worn out keys and a shared bathroom. This place charged us $70 euro a night for a place that was new, with marble, private bathroom, air conditioning, and an elevator..which believe me helps so much after 2.5 weeks of traveling with luggage.
