The desk clerk graciously allowed us to check in early and we made our way up to our room with very little delay. Although I was slightly concerned about security, the key to activate the elevator along with the locks on the door and the locking system on the shared bathroom doors, made me feel much relieved. Our room had two twin beds and an excellent flat screen tv. The establishment loses a few points for an obviously broken desk and a leak in the ceiling over the closet. The ceiling tile was discolored which I thought meant the leak was old. However, the pillow on the shelf was also stained which told me the leak was more recent (or maybe the pillow hadn't been moved for a long time?). Wireless Internet was an extra CD$6 a day, which I didn't mind too much. A tip for those who have a room with a shared bathroom...bring rubber shower shoes. We were aghast to hear our neighbors blowing their nose IN THE SHOWER. Revolting. You'll love the location of this hotel. It's two blocks from the metro and 2.5 blocks from Cafe Medina. The area is safe, the hotel is secure and the staff incredibly friendly and helpful.

For less than half the price of those hotels, I thoroughly enjoyed the YWCA. It had everything we needed. It was clean, quiet, and comfortable. The staff is warm, friendly knowledgable and helpful. The other guests were travelers from around the globe. All the visitors seemed to be margin conscious travelers with a good sense for a good deal. It was a treat to have a nice walk to and from the conference center each day. The best part of my stay came at the end. My car would not start, due to having left a light on for a number of days. The hotel engineer graciously came to my rescue. He helped me work out how to make all of my meetings and return to the hotel later in the afternoon while he was still working and gladly jumped my car and got me heading home. This sort of help and support was beyond the call of duty.

I think YWCA is ok but I rather pay $ 25 pernight at Georgian Court next door which have much larger room, plusher beds and as also provide free Wi-Fi and complimentary bicycle rental which was a great value for the 4 of us as you would have to pay $ 25 rental per person for half a day rental...YWCA should increase its value proposition or lower the price to achieve the value for money I am looking for...", "Date": "July 4, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "3", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Ireland", "Title": "\u201cReasonable price if on a budget\u201d", "Author": "jules7706", "ReviewID": "UR114907744", "Content": "Stayed here for first couple of nights in Vancouver and it was a good deal compared to other accommodation around.

Game 6 wasn't bad but there were yahoos running through the streets and screaming after Game 5... for several hours. And the sidewalks reeked of stale beer and urine the next morning. I was a bit surprised a couple of things, but they were easily fixed: 1. Tiny cafe in front serving just bagels/cookies. No real breakfast, eggs etc. But I found a good breakfast place around the corner, attached to the Library. It's called Gutenberg. (Just remember the first printing press...) 2. Internet ... they charged $1 per 7.5 minutes. Yes. 7 min and 30 seconds. Not sure what happens if you go 1 second over!! Is that another $1. But you can go to the Library for free and use the internet there. A few blocks away. No big deal. 3. Renting pots/cutlery, plates etc. They charge $2.50 per day (EVERY day you use them so this can add up if you're there for a week or so). This seems a bit tacky, as most hostels I've stayed in come equipped with this and don't charge extra. If they're afraid of theft maybe they could just ask for a deposit and give it back to you when you check out.

We chose the YWCA because the room value is SO much better than any other hotel in the city. At first, this made us a little nervous, but after arriving at the hotel all our worries disappeared. The staff are all very friendly and helpful. They were quick to offer suggestions for good places to eat in the area right when we checked in, and gave us a map, highlighting the way to get to many of the attractions in the area we were interested in seeing! Our room had two double beds and since no private bathroom was available, we shared a bathroom with the neighboring room. This was never a problem, and I never felt like I was going to get walked in on. The locking system for the shared bathrooms is very secure. The room itself is very basic. There is a desk, a small tv, a closet, a sink, and some shelving. The pictures on the website are very accurate. Each room also has a mini-fridge and its own sink and mirrors, so you don't need to spend time in the shared bathroom getting ready. The rooms are kept clean, just as clean as any other more expensive hotel I have stayed in, and we had a lovely view of science world from the 9th floor. There is also a little coffee shop connected to the hotel where you can buy beverages and baked goods on your way out in the morning. The hotel has a 'quiet time' (for rooms with shared bathrooms at least) of 11pm, so we were never disturbed during the night by noise. As well, the front doors are locked at 11pm, so you have to buzz in to get inside. There are also keys for the elevator and you turn your room keys in to the front desk every time you leave the hotel, so I felt very safe staying there. By far my favorite thing about this hotel was the location! It is within walking distance to almost anything you could need. Chinatown, Gastown, Yaletown, and Granville Street are just a quick walk away. If you want to go to Granville Market it is a short walk to the seabus terminal, which takes you directly there and the ride is beautiful. It is also two blocks away from the chinatown skytrain station which will get you where you need to go in no time. When we booked the hotel we had no idea how close to everything we would be, so it was a pleasant surprise to see how much money we saved on transportation! Overall, I was EXTREMELY impressed with the YWCA hotel! If you are a budget traveller in Vancouver, especially if you will not be driving in the city, this hotel is perfect. I will definitely be back next time I visit Vancouver!", "Date": "September 28, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "4", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Melbourne", "Title": "\u201cGreat Value\u201d", "Author": "hels_belsMelbourne", "ReviewID": "UR20391658", "Content": "This place is much better value than anywhere else I found in Vancouver.

We stayed in a room with a private bathroom both times. I'm sure you've stayed at places that demand a high price tag, but are completely impractical for the traveller. You may be surrounded by great views or furnishings but all these nice extras are superfluous to your needs and things you do really need when you're on an extended holiday.... ironing board....convenient washing facilities.....the sort of comfortable furnishings you'd find at home... are either troublesome to acquire or simply not available. This is not one of those places. In fact, this place hits the spot when it comes to providing what you need when travelling. This place gets the basics right where so many businesses get these basic things so wrong. In short, this place is awesome and is in the top 3 hotels we stayed in throughout our trip to Canada (out of say 20 hotels we stayed in). It was also one of the 3 cheapest. Make no mistake it is budget, but it has all the necessary conveniences and the basic luxuries (space and facilities). Great washing facilities and the disabled room we had was huge. We looked forward to returning to this accommodation despite having stayed extensive periods in hotels where we paid rates over 7 times more expensive. This hotel is close to the 'bad' part of town, but you wouldn't know it unless you happened to walk in a North-East direction. You are close to a skytrain station (to get you across town a little quicker) and you're close to the Vancouver retail district. The people at reception were very helpful and friendly. The money we saved we put towards dinner at Le Gavroche. Lovely ambience, but the quality of the meal did not match the price. Rooms only contain double or single beds as far as I am aware.

The room I stayed in is exactly the same (if not the same one) as in the example photo for a \"single room\" on the hotel website (the photo with the Asian woman at the desk). The only issue I had with the room was that there was not sufficient lighting for reclining on the bed to read. I remedied this by using my suitcase as a makeshift nightstand and placed the desk lamp on it for reading on the bed (no TV remember). The shower/toilet facilities where always kept immaculately clean and they were always available for use. In fact, I never saw another hotel guest on the floor when I was walking to and from my room to the washing facilities. I did hear hallway noise from the kitchen facility and fellow guests coming and going during the daytime and early evening, but nothing (not a peep) in the late evenings. Nice restful sleeps. The efficiency and personality level of the front desk staff was on par with the basic/no-frills accommodation of the hotel... no person was rude and no person was great at providing service. They are just there and give you $56 per night service. The hotel does have a small room that guests can hold luggage in, but it there is no bellboy service so the room is not maintained by the hotel. Guests place their own luggage in the room and retrieve it themselves... meaning store your luggage here at your own risk. I stored my luggage with no problem. There is a small coffee/snack shop in the lobby that is good for a morning cup, pastry or piece of fruit. Also, there are a number of places to eat or have a drink nearby and walking to Yaletown and the area on Robson that has all the food & beverage options anyone needs is reasonable distance from the hotel... the area on Robson past Burrard is not as close as Yaletown, but is near enough for a pleasant walk.
