My daughter had booked tickets for 2 shows as a birthday treat for me.The area around Paddington seemed a good location BUT: The pictures of the interior on the website were nothing like the real interior. The breakfast room had plain wooden chairs, a very poor apology of a continental breakfast with baked beans, boiled eggs, no sausage(as claimed),thinly sliced white or brown bread, butter,jam, thermos tea and coffee, sliced tinned peaches....Maybe I got the wrong continent!!!!! I was given a ground floor internal room which had only an internal window on to the corridor(meaning I had to keep the curtains closed all the time.The shower room looked as though the sanitary ware had been picked up at a boot sale, nothing matched.there was a fixed head shower which was filthy and the tiling in the shower had black mould on the grouting.There were no shower caps given, unlike in all other hotels where I've stayed, so being short I would have got drenched hair had I dared to use this. Consequently I had to make do with the wash basin, the size normally used in toilet cubicles for hand washing only. As I returned on my first night I asked about the lack of facilities,internal window etc. but the man on duty more or less implied what did I expect for the price that I paid!! Sorry but \u00a3130 for a room implied as a discounted room means I expected far more. The extractor in the internal shower room did not work and neither did some of the electricity switches. The bedding was clean. As I left and handed in my key at the end of my stay I pointed out how disappointed I had been and voiced my worries over the health hazards of the shower room pointing out that poor thermal temperature and mould etc were great growing media for bacteria etc Legionnella etc. I told the woman I would be commenting on my disappointment at which point she offered me a refund. Maybe she thought that would satisfy me!", "Date": "March 22, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Guisborough, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cEnjoyable stay\u201d", "Author": "SueSimpson292", "ReviewID": "UR125636840", "Content": "We checked the reviews on this hotel after we had booked so arrived feeling rather anxious as to where we were staying.

Bedding was clean & the beds very comfortable, The en-suite was small but totally adequate for our needs and clean. I agree the decor could do with brightening up & the carpets had seen better days but it was clean & tidy. The staff were friendly & helpful. Breakfast was basic & uninspiring to be honest but for someone who doesn't eat much breakfast any way it was adequate. Location to Paddington underground was excellent as literally no more than 5 mins walk. We checked out after breakfast on our last day & as our train was not booked til 7pm that evening we asked if we could leave our luggage at the hotel for the day which was no problem, for this we were really grateful.

When told him not to be rude especially to a guest, the receptionist then told my husband to \"pack you things and get lost!\" not enough of that, when we finally returned the key, the receptionist took the key and said, \" yeah...buzz off\" What an experience after only being in London for less than 24 hours !! He said other things too, which i think its un-appropriate for me to say here, but definitely, even if the hotel is giving low rates, i would definitely NOT stay here again.

Had to move bed to below window (reasoning for this so that nobody could get in!!) as it was so hot couldnt close window. Girls slept ok but not me. Foreign men talking outside not sure whether in small courtyard outside window or above on pavement kept me awake for ages. Looking forward to english breakfast as quoted when booked but no such luck-only toast available when we got there at 9.00am. Offered fried rice!!

Our room was a good size for London, with plenty of space to put luggage. The bedroom was clean and we had a lot of fresh towels. The front desk staff were friendly and polite. If I could moan about one thing, it was the room we were given (No. 2). This is directly underneath the reception. All you hear first thing in the morning are the sound of footsteps above your head as people arrive and check out. The curtains are tatty in this room and did not block out the daylight and street lighting. Also, the window looked a little easy to open from a burglary point of view (although we have no evidence to suggest that this would happen). Still, it was a good from a fire escape point of view. There's a kettle in the room for coffee making (no tea was provided for us). You do have to fill it slowly with cups though, as it won't fit under the tap in the bathroom. There are basic toiletries provided. We had breakfast before checking out and it was a very basic affair. There were sausages and scrambled egg, but they looked like they had been there a while. Fair enough, as we were one of the last to arrive I suppose.
