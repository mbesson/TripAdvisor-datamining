The pool and hot tub were clean and they provided pool towels for your convenience. The one thing that was not as expected was their continental breakfast. Orange juice, coffee, and packaged pop parts, cinnamon rolls, donut sticks and pecan rolls was all they offered.

The worst part is the room where we stayed. Within 3 days I killed 4 roaches. I don't think this is the activity that people on the vacation should spend their time on. Bed sheets were grey in color and not white and they actually smelled with cigarets. Good thing is that in every room you have a small kitchen where you can prepare tea or coffee in the morning or you can even make a small meal. Another good feature of this hotel is a small pool which is heated in winters and jacuzzi, which you can ask to be switched on.

The room is average; about what you would expect from a Daytona hotel. Now, I normally reward positive experiences in all of my reviews, but unfortunately this hotel didn't deliver. I decided to try this place based on the information I read here. It was a Sunday night and slow. The front desk clerk was friendly, but as soon as I mentioned I booked the room through a third-party service, she automatically said \"oh well you know that this room doesn't have a view right? They probably told you it did because they lie to their customers all the time.\" This is the second time a hotel has bad-mouthed a travel service. I'm not sure what the war is between hotels and third-party booking agencies, but when I was at the airlines I didn't bad-mouth other carriers. I explained I knew it didn't have a view and they were honest when I booked it. Despite the fact that there were maybe 5 cars in the entire parking lot, she put us in a room right between two elevators. I gave it a chance since there weren't many people around. Bad idea. At 5 a.m. we were rudely awakened by the hallway trash can in front of our room getting loudly knocked over and crashed into our door, with people yelling and talking in the halls. It sounded as if the staff was emptying the trash and not caring who heard. I don't want to blame them and don't know why they would empty the trash so early, so maybe it wasn't them. Maybe it was other guests acting badly. We were awake for a while after that. We finally fell back asleep and woke up around 8 a.m. to some sort of loud repetitive sounds. I chalked it up to elevator noise and eventually decided to get up. The phone rang at 11:00 a.m. and the voice on the other end curtly said \"We were wondering if you were ever checking out today.\" Pardon me? When is check-out? 11 a.m...OK 11 a.m. is now and you are already trying to rush us out, even though the hotel is practically deserted. I said I would be down in a few minutes and hung up. I should have inquired when check-out was, and normally I am told by the front desk when I check in. 11 a.m. is a bit early, but fine. I probably slept too long because I didn't get a good night's sleep, but I've never had a hotel call right at check-out time. Most hotels are a bit more courteous or forgiving. I opened my door and the cleaning crew was standing right outside waiting. One said \"oh speak of the devil...\" They came in the room before I even had a chance to walk out. I am definitely not one of those guests who abuses my check-out time, and I have stayed in many hotels, but I have never been made to feel so unwelcome or rushed to leave. I really don't appreciate that, seeing how I chose your hotel and paid to stay there. I am always courteous and respectful to people and expect the same in return. I went downstairs and the two front desk agents were chatting away and ignored me for a while. Finally they said \"oh checking out...OK.\" I held my tongue and just handed them the key. My traveling companion asked for a receipt. One said \"Oh we can't do that because you booked it through your third-party.\" (Fine, but I'm sure you have some sort of our information in the computer.) No thank yous, goodbyes, how was your stay, just back to the conversation as we walked out. I was angry when I left but I didn't say anything, and it takes quite a bit to get me angry. I can promise I will not return to this hotel that couldn't wait for me to leave. I'm only giving them average because of the good location and the distant possibility the staff were all having a bad day at the same time.

When we checked in the manager was the one who was dealing with us. When he realized we were booked into seperate room types for the two nights he went into his reservations on his computer and figured out how he could give us an oceanfront room for both nights so we wouldn't have to move and we could enjoy the incredible view for our whole stay.This was really going above and beyond because we didn't even ask him to do this, he just did it.

This suite was better, but the hotel remains outdated and the furniture, knick knacks, and fake plants are right out of the 1980\u2019s. It appears that overall the cleaning and maintenance staff lack attention to detail as again there was missing paint in some areas, broken knick knacks, and dusty fake plants. I would recommend to management to impress upon his staff that it is important when they see things that are broken, or in need of service to inform you to get them resolved. I initially thought that this was a huge problem because I travel so frequently to many areas, but after spending the day in Daytona and seeing other available options in the Daytona Shores area, I can say without a doubt that this hotel is probably your best bet if you do not want to break the bank. It\u2019s a middle of the road beach hotel \u2013 it provides air conditioning, the beach, and a small kitchen which is good if you are traveling with a family. Overall the place is cleaner than I remembered and the staff is friendly enough. After now staying in the suite I would definitely recommend the place for the value of your money, but suggest paying the extra for a beach side room. I would also suggest either getting rid of the offered \u201ccontinental breakfast\u201d or upgrading the items \u2013 as it simply seems like a bunch of Walmartish/generic pecan rolls and granola bars.

Obviously, from my review title, you can see that it did not. I am wondering if some of the previous reviews were written by real guests?... Anyway, when we checked in the lady at the front desk told us that we got the very last room in the place. After seeing our room I totally believe that because our room was like a dungeon and should not even be available for booking on any website. We had one long, but small window that looked out onto a concrete wall or rooftop; there was barely even any daylight in the room when the curtains were open. The hotel was dirty; we should have known something was up when we got to our room and the \u201cpublic\u201d trashcan was right outside of our door with trash in bags sitting in the floor next to it. Our room in particular did not appear to have been cleaned properly (that or the hotel is so old that everything just looks dirty) and did not have adequate bedding. When we asked about a blanket for our bed at the front desk we were told that they don\u2019t put blankets on the beds but they are available by request (I have never heard of a hotel in my life that doesn\u2019t put any type of blanket on the beds) but we still did not receive a blanket because they were all out (maybe other people expected blankets on their beds too?). The furnishings in the room looked like they were from 1980 and the room was so dark and dingy that my husband and I almost considered leaving the hotel and going back home. The bed was just about unbearable and we woke up very sore the next morning after what little sleep we could get due to the all of the noise from other guests on our floor. The high-speed internet access did not work for almost the entirety of our stay (which was less than 18 hours due to our quick exit on checkout morning). All of the pool towels were gone every time we attempted to get one to use. The continental breakfast was nonexistent. I could go on and on, but suffice to say, this was not the type of stay we were expecting for a quick, impromptu anniversary weekend getaway. Also, I saw the management response to a previous negative review and I think they are just trying to act like they care so that people who come to Tripadvisor to read reviews will think one or two negative reviews are not the norm at this hotel - I don't buy it for a minute and furthermore, there was no \"letter of welcome\" from the GM in our room and the comment regarding this hotel being the \"newest\" in the area is ridiculous, maybe new management, a new name, or something similar, but definitely not a \"new\" hotel.", "Date": "October 11, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "delta,mo", "Title": "\u201cI had another wonderful vacation !\u201d", "Author": "mojabo", "ReviewID": "UR119166971", "Content": "Emerald Shores is our favorite beach front hotel in Daytona Beach.

If the hotel is busy their parking lot may fill up, but the front desk will give you a parking permit to park across the street. My only problem with the hotel was the housekeeping girl during our second weekend at the hotel. On Friday she came knocking at 9:15 (while we were still in bed) and I asked for an extra hour. She said no problem so we got up, got ready for the beach, and were out within an hour. Saturday, again the knock came at 9:15 while we were in bed. I answered the door, asked for an hour, and the girl gave me an attitude while questioning me. So I asked for a half hour instead, which she said fine. 20 minutes later we got one knock, while she barged right in (luckily we were both dressed, but we still weren't ready). I asked for 10 more minutes and the girl rolls her eyes at me and walks out. When we came back, we saw that only the bed was made, but we still had a pile of towels from the previous day and no fresh towels. Sunday we put up the do not disturb sign on the door, but were still out of the room before 10am (which was when we took the do not disturb off the door). We returned at 11:30 am to put something back in the room and saw the housekeeping cart next door. After a day at the beach we came back and the room wasn't touched at all. I have no problem making the bed myself, but I do find it a bit much to have to walk down to the first floor to get towels when someone is getting paid to put them in my room.

This small privately owned oceanfront hotel is intimate and more reminiscent of a European boutique-style hotel. The oceanfront rooms are spacious with mini-kitchens and nice private patios. There is a game room for and comfortable sitting area for adults.The lobby is always sparkly clean as are pool and jacuzzi area and the property is smoke-free which is a plus for us! It is especially nice to find a place where everyone on the staff treats guests in a friendly and personal manner-from front desk to housekeeping to manager and even the owner,Phil. The new manager Bradley is eager to please and ensure that guests are having 'fun' while continuing to make improvements as needed. While all of the staff members are friendly and accommodating I would especially like to thank KAELIE- a young, enthusiastic college student who has worked here over the years. KAELIE always welcomes us with a bright-eyed smile no matter how late at night we arrive. She is a great conversationalist and she is always there to answer questions, make suggestions about the area, and satisfy every need of every guest. Kaelie has a special spark and she takes a personal interest and responsibility ensuring that everyone is comfortable and happy! My husband and I travel a lot so we look forward to coming here and being treated with that personal touch rather than matter-of-factly as just another tourist as in many chain hotels. We sometimes feel like this is our 'home away from home'. Areas for improvement: Internet is often slow and it would be helpful to add a small business center or place for guests to have access to a printer. Labor Day weekend was a full house and we could not get a parking space in the main lot because some people came with more than one car. While there is an annex across the street we were hesitant to park there because we had a bike on the roof. Some hotels give parking passes and perhaps this would be a good plan on crowded weekends so that each room gets one pass for the main parking lot and the second or third car uses the annex.", "Date": "September 10, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "1", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Tampa, Florida", "Title": "\u201cBeds hard as a rock!!\u201d", "Author": "rothmnfl", "ReviewID": "UR78722925", "Content": "When I first got to our room, I was disgusted at the lack of decor and the color of the curtains.

Very little counter space at all, esp. to do dishes on. The shower head was in terrible shape and water came out slow. Toilet was great. Hot tub outstanding and so was the pool. They add chemicals often! Hotel is very close to water edge so that is huge plus. Breakfast was very cheap, breakfast bars and such from Walmart. Breakfast is only from 7-9AM as well. Internet connection is rotten unless you go down to lobby. It's so so if you use the internet when everyone is outside in the sun, but then you miss out. Night time is the worst. If you have a job and need good internet service, this place is not for you. Try the Acapulco Hotel for that if you can stand dirty pools and gross hot tubs : ) Oh, the parking is free and that is a huge plus. No bible or phone books in the rooms either. The beds are not comfortable and the desk person told us they tidy up the beds for you but DO NOT CHANGE SHEETS before the 3rd day, per law. Whatever that means! They did vacuum and give clean towels. If you want pool towels you have to get them from the front desk which sucks. There is no staff there at night really, just a desk lady. That air conditioner only comes on with someone in the room and it was hot and stuff in there when we got there. It regulates on the wall and comes out by the sliding glass doors the usual way.

The continental breakfast is rather poor. It consists of orange juice and pop tarts. The bathroom was dirty (hairs all over the place) and condensation from the air conditioning unit was causing moss to grow on the balcony. Also my wife came away with a few bites on her legs. Not sure if it was bedbugs. We inspected the room but didn't see any and I didn't have any bites. Also, the hallways got loud with people slamming doors. It was a nice hotel for the price.

We got into our room and went straight out to the balcony. It was just gorgeous! And a good thing about the balcony is that you couldn't see your neighbors and they couldn't see you. The parking is free at the hotel but I wouldn't recommend walking to wherever you're wanting to go. It's a litle far, plus there are all kinds of people on the streets. But if you are driving to the \"down town area be prepared to pay to park anywhere you go. The continental breakfast isn't good enough to wake up for. They have coffee, honeybuns, and some granola bars. We choose to go to IHOP which was basically just across the street. The people there are wonderful and one nice waiter named Justin even drew us a map of where all we wanted to go. The beaches aren't too crowded in front of this hotel at all which was a huge plus for me.

Since then,we have purchased three timeshares and have been using them to our great pleasure. I decided to treat my wife to a Mother's Day week-end on the beach.Emerald Shores had just sent us an e-mail offering a 30% discount so I booked a room. When we arrived we were pleased that,in addition to the discount,we had been given a complimentary upgrade to an oceanfront efficiency from a regular double queen room. Although we barely used the kitchen,the microwave was useful for our evening meal. During the afternoon of the first day we decided to use the deck at one of our timeshare properties in Daytona.The deck at Emerald Shores is very quiet with only a small pool and a jacuzzi. Emerald Shores is on a quieter part of the beach:great if this is what you want. While staying there,we noted a few problems.Just small maintenance issues.Broken towel rack over the toilet, walls that had not been patched or painted.Also, beware,there is a $10 charge if you stay in an efficiency and you do not clean up the dishes that you use when you depart.Strangely,no dishwasher detergent was provided us for cleaning up,so we used the bar soap from the bath. The BIG complaint that we had was that two patrons on the floor above us had booked rooms and crammed in eight people per room .They then proceeded to party until two oclock in the morning.I called the front desk and complained.The noise continued.I yelled at them from the balcony.The noise continued. Finally,management called in the sheriff.The \"illicits\" were removed,while those paying guests who invited them in were allowed to stay.I was told that they would be put on a list and not be allowed to return there as guests.I was also told that Emerald Shores does not rent to locals,in order to avoid such situations. My rebuttal is...\"Why wasn't the front desk attendant more vigilant in order to prevent such situations,and to protect the interests of the legitimate guests who pay to have a peaceful time without ugly scenes?\" There is only one way in and one way out of the hotel unless the \"illicits\" enter from the beach.No survellance cams, no electronic gates with pass keys.Easy to implement,but costly.I'm willing to give Emerald Shores one pass on this because it may have been an isolated incident.While we were staying there,we were told that they were at 35% occupancy.This may be normal for this time of year in this rather isolated part of Daytona Beach Shores.However,with the 30% discount...Maybe anyone is welcome. I truly hope not because Emerald Shores IS a degreee more classy than most of the other overpriced, oceanfront, mold-magnet hotels along this part of the beach. It is nicer and cleaner.I'd hate to see it just take the easy route and not put any money back into the operation.

Saw the pictures online and made reservations. The front desk receptionist that was working that night (Rose) greeted us by name. I guess she knew who we were because of our very late arrival time. She was very informative and really sweet. The pool is always open, so is the hot tub. Plenty of space to walk about. The pool is kind of small, but deep. There's even a water hose provided to spray off the sand when you come back from the beach. Game room appeared to be nice. We stayed on the 5th floor, our room just happened to have a view of the drive-thru/drop off roof thing, it was kind of odd to look at but didn't bother us -- could have had an oceanfront room for a little more money, but we were on a budget. Rooms are actually really large, up to date. Digital thermostat and the air conditioner even has a motion detector, so it turns the air on or off depending if there's occupants in the room. Great if you come in from the water wet and don't want to freeze your butt off, and good energy conservation. Bathroom was absolutely spotless and a fun color. Shower was powerful and very hot, although the cold setting was the hot and vice versa. Oh well, big deal. Parking lot was full to the rim, the lot seems kind of small for the amount of rooms available, though we didn't have any issue finding spots. I'm sure we were lucky and got one of the last ones. For the hotel to be so crowded, it was very quiet, even during the day. Decided it was time for Steak and Shake at 3am, Rose directed us to the nearest one. She also offered extra towels for the pool in case we needed them. We were treated like family basically. Housekeeping did a great job of cleaning the room when we were on the beach. Continental breakfast wasn't available when I walked down to the lobby at 8:30 the next morning, but who cares, there's an IHOP down the street. Along with Publix and Walgreens and anything else you need. . The beach is very nice, however watch out for cars and stumble into a wooden speed limit sign in the middle of the dark like I did.

Though we found our 9th floor efficiency almost spotless (request the upper fringes if you want a quiet one folks, the pool area NEVER closes), we also encountered a long list of amenities that were curiously lacking. Our expansive room featured a private oceanfront view (breathtaking...definitely worth the extra $$$!), two queen beds, two burner cooktop, fridge and mini microwave...but no dishwasher. No dish drainer either. Having to wash and dry every cup and saucer by hand, using the already limited supply of bath towels, quickly proved a dull and tedious task. On the upside, the courteous staff did their best to accomodate us, and made sure we never in short supply of any daily necessities. Outside proved the biggest enigma, as an endless array of cigarette butts and plastic bags repeatedly found their way into the pool and spa area, not to mention an ever thickening layer of sand along the bottom of the pool. This, coupled with a greasy, murky film atop the water left us pondering the curious lack of exterior standards...strange considering the hotel's nearly flawless interior. No restaurant, no cafe or bar, no place for grilling despite a grassy, underdeveloped area on the north side of the complex...just a small, albeit sparkling lobby where a paltry continental breakfast is offered up each morning till 9am. And we musn't forget the rather limited game room through which you must enter from the pool area so as not to drip water along the lobby floor. (?!?) As our holiday was limited to only a quick weekend getaway, the Emerald Shores served our needs well. Next time however, given the host of options that mark the rapidly aging Daytona shoreline, we might opt for something slightly more accomodating, both outside AND in.

So when I booked this \"promotional\" stay at this hotel I was nevertheless going to be skeptical (regardless of what the pictures on the website looked like). I was pleasantly pleased!! The hotel had an appealing lobby with nice furniture, continental breakfast needs a little help, front desk staff were very friendly, pool / hot tub area was basic, access to the beach was excellent, location to attractions, restuarants, etc was good, housekeeping ladies were very accommadating and very friendly, rooms were more spacious than your average hotel room with one of our rooms having a refrig, stove, microwave, pots/pans, dishes, etc. The other room only had a smaller refrig and microwave. Be sure to ask for a room with the extra kitchen appliances. Ask for Beachfront...the \"Riverfront\" or \"Intracoastal\" view is not good at all. Definitely want a Beachfront room. The hotel is only 9 stories high, so ask for the highest floor for best view of the ocean and coastline. We were on the 8th floor and had a good view. Parking is very limited...if you are traveling with more than one vehicle (like us) you want to protect your parking spots as best as possible. Otherwise, if the lot gets full you have to park across the street (Atlantic Ave.) and the area is bloched with lower income looking people and houses. Overall...unless I was staying at the Wyndam OceanWalk Resort (where we are timeshare owners), this is not a bad option at all if you are looking for just a clean, fairly spacious place to lay your head and is right on the beach.

We had an oceanfront efficiency on the 5th floor. The total for the four nights was $470. The beach is located in Daytona Beach Shores, south of Daytona. It's more quiet, not so many rowdy college kids. All rooms are non-smoking, but smoking is allowed on the OF balonies and pool deck. Drinking is allowed (no glass!) on the pool deck as well. As for the room, everything appeared clean. No mold anywhere but there was some staining on the carpets The beds were OK, only a sheet and thin \"comforter\" for blankets. There were four pillows to a bed which was nice. CONS: Cannot control the room temperature. They have something called a GEM system (or something like that) which controls the room temp for you. It also allows housekeeping to know if you are in your room or not. I would look it up (I don't know how common those things are, I wasn't comfortable not being allowed to control the temperature of my room considering the money I was paying. Housekeeping was SUPER friendly but unfortunately non of the rooms have a \"DO NOT DISTURB\" sign. You have to personally call down to the front desk and let them know you do not want to be disturbed, even if you do not want housekeeping. The hot tub smelled funky and appeared dirty but on the other hand, the pool was super clean. This hotel was very average. I would probably not stay here again due to the fact there are 45 other hotels in the area with better ratings. --We had a kitchen in our room which helped us save money but there are so many restaurants around not cooking wouldn't be a problem. There are two grocery stores within a mile of the hotel (I prefered PUBLIX, the ppl were a lot nicer and so was the store).

I definitely recommend staying in Daytona Shores rather than picking a hotel near Daytona Beach and the pier. The reason why is because The Shores hotels seem to be newer and therefore cleaner plus the beaches are so much nicer. It is a short drive straight up Atlantic Av to get to Daytona Beach (less than 10 mins.) The beach outside Emerald Shores was amazing. The sand was like talcum powder and it was so clean and quiet. Many times we were the only people on the beach. The hotel is a newer hotel, I think it was built in 2004. Upon checking in everything was very nice and clean. The bathroom was spacious. The room had 2 queen beds that were very comfortable and the sheets were white and of a higher thread count. The TV had all the channels that I am used to at home. The room included a microwave and a minifridge, both were brand new. There was a sitting area with 2 chairs and a table. The hotel supplies you with soap, shampoo and conditioner from Bath & Body Works. We were on the 3rd floor and the view was excellent. The pool was heated and clean and the hot tub was nice as well. I loved that they allowed you to use the pool after dusk, most hotels won't. The staff was friendly and housekeeping was acceptable.The only thing that disturbed me was that when the lady came to make the beds she didn't bring new sheets she just remade the beds even if the sheets needed to be changed. The price of this room was $109.00 a night which I thought was pricey considering it was just a normal hotel room with 2 beds. If I was comparing it to other hotels I'd say is was more like a $79.00-$89.00 room. Please note that there are no laundry facilities and it costs .50 cents for each local phone call.
