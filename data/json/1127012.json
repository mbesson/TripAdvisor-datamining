The towels had holes, the windows don't close well enough, the view is awful, the curtains 20 years old ..., the staff speaking few english, wi-fi was out of order in rooms and you must have great patience to use the elevators as they stop whenever they like.

Don't be fooled by the photos on the website - the rooms are much smaller and are not nearly as fascinating the visually modified photos are. The view was terrible and dirty and we simply refused to open the window as we didn't want air from the outside coming in. The shower seemed impressive from a distance, but once you get close, you'll find that its not well cleaned and maintained; all the fancy functions don't work either. The same goes for the toilet...dirty and toilet seat wasn't steadily attached. We found used tissues and toothpicks on the carpet, room was badly lit, and the air-cond blows room temparature air. I was horribly disgusted when my hand had sticky substance stuck to it when i held the phone by the mouth piece. The coffee and tea dispenser in the restaurant was not well cleaned and neither were the plates (that's what my friend told me when she tried to grab a plate for breakfast. She found at least 4 of such, in the stack of plates left out for guests to use). The lifts are also small, so we had to use the stairs on more than one occasion throughout our 2-day stay there. II never really got to experience the warmth and friendliness of the hotel staff to comment much, but I do appreciate the fact that they were able to fix the non-functioning light in our room within a few hours. So, I guess the service was ok. In short, unless you've completely run out of options, try to avoid this hotel.", "Date": "June 6, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "2", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Sleep Quality": "2", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Montreal, Canada", "Title": "\u201cAvoid this hotel\u201d", "Author": "sousou20011", "ReviewID": "UR107984481", "Content": "Rooms very small, the hotel is well located but service is bad.

The breakfast buffet is pretty generous though more like Eastern European type than Scandinavian. The complimentary (because of delayed check-in) dinner buffet was OK, but nothing to be remembered. The lobby bar is \"a healthy bar\" with non-alcholic drinks. The staff is attentive and friendly both in the restaurant and reception.

Having travelled in a group of forty plus people, we had loads of fun... Ikbal Deluxe Hotel is quite different from most of the hotels I have stayed in. The best part about the hotel is the location which is in close proximity to all the main attractions. Its actually walking distance from the Grand Bazar. The hotel has leased some shops commercially at the ground level so the entrance doesn't look like a hotel. Its only once you are in front of the hotel and read the sign board that you realize you've arrived. The hotel is surronded by other hotels with the same concept and mostly sell upmarket leather goods. The staff are friendly in the hotel although language seemed to be a bit of a problem. I got an upgrade to an Executive room. The layout on each floor is a bit confusing with small corridors leading to certain rooms, which takes a while to get used to. The room itself is good - the decor, which neat was different from my tastes - blue velvet curtains, blue velevt sofas and a blue velvet bedspread. The Plasma monitor (17 inch screen) just showed 1 English news channel while the other 50 odd channels transmitted just turkish stations (including CNN Turk). The bathrooms were good with a mini jacuzzi and some fresh cinnamon soap provided daily. The towels were also perfumed. Our package included a daily buffet breakfast which was served in the restaurant on the 8th floor. The views from the resturant are panaromic and the buffet was elobarate and there was sufficient variety. I even tried out the a la carte menu , where the food was tasty and the portion size huge. The gaming room for kids was nice with the coin operated machines. The sauna and steam room are complimentary only between 1pm and 5pm and chrgeable afterwards although the health club usage was free. The only thing which was a bit irritating was the power sensors in the corridors. While it is good to be environmentally friendly, areas like the public corridors need some lighting on all the time. It becomes very difficult to find your way when the corridors are not straight and you have to wait till the light come on... The other thing was no newspapers..for a hotel which has a four star rating I expect them to provide a daily newspaper...
