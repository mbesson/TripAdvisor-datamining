We stayed at the Myers twice for three days each and found it quite pleasant. The breakfast looked good, but is a bit pricy for us. However, less than half a block away is a cafe on Prenzlauer Allee that serves a delicious breakfast (though they don't open until 9-9:30). The staff was particularly pleasant and helpful, with excellent English skills. The rooms were small by American standards, but not by European standards. We were disappointed there was no mini-fridge in one of our rooms, and there was a charge for using the internet, but those are minor concerns. More important, he rooms were comfortable and quiet (the advantage of a residential street) and overlooked a courtyard. And there was no smell of smoke.

We stayed here in a pinch and were highly disapointed. We paid $140 euros per night for a very small room which smelled of smoke masked with air freshener, the smell was actually nauseating and we had to leave the windows open for the entire two days we were there! Which made for a terrible nights sleep due to the fact that there was very little space between rooms and the voices carried quite late into the night. The bathroom was not very clean, to be specific there were little black hairs all around the sink by the faucette and the towels had a musty smell. The decor dates back to before the wall came down. On a very small bright note, the people were friendly, the location was good & they had pleanty of selection for breakfast. In conclusion, the value to money ratio is non existant and unless you like sharing the elevator with multiple smokers, this is probably not the place for you either!", "Date": "October 24, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "1", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Port Moody, Canada", "Title": "\u201cnot bad,, not great\u201d", "Author": "traveller47", "ReviewID": "UR10033563", "Content": "Stayed here for 3 nights then moved to Alexander Plaza ( see review). Myer's is located a bit further out in Prenz'lberg and there is really no night life, cafes etc in the immediate vicinity.More like being on a residential block. It is fairly close to Kowllwitz Platz where you will find some good cafes. The room we had was a non smoking but it was on a smoking floor and we were assaulted by smoke coming and going. The room was quite large with skylights but it was impossible to stand upright in the tub/shower due to sloping ceiling. Originally we were on a floor that was completely non smoking but the window was onto a very small interior courtyard/lightwell...rather claustrophobic so the hotel did move us. As mentioned in another review the desk staff is actually off in a small side room..there is a bar off the reception area but again it was filled with smoke. The nearest internet access was about 10 minutes walk in an area that was not very welcoming. Having said all that the breakfast at Myer's was the best we encountered in 3 weeks of travel. Lots of variety, hot eggs, cheeses, fish, assorted fruit juices and served in a very nice room looking out onto a garden. Access by the tram was fairly easy but we felt we were just a bit too far from main sights. The decor was a mix of old and new, hotel was clean.

My single room was comfortable with a window overlooking a pleasant garden. The service was OK, reception is sited to the side of the entrance so it looks like there's no-one around to greet you when you arrive. I like a welcoming front desk rather than having to stick my head round a door to get someone's attention. The breakfast room was pleasant with a reasonable choice of the usual breakfast stuffs, cereal, meats, eggs, cheese, juice etc. I liked the area, it was a nice mix of old houses with some modern and sympathetic development work going on. Handy for Alexanderplatz with trams and other U bahns close to hand. I had a very nice , reasonably priced meal in Gugelhof - 5 mins from the hotel, and there was a very pleasant local cafe scene.
