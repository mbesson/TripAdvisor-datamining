The bus will come every half hour to pick up for the beach club or you can also get dropped off close to 10th ave for shopping ect. I enjoy taking the bus..its very convenient and a great service. I am leaving for this resort again in 2 weeks and cant wait. I do use the facilities at the Yucatan and Playacar also for a change thruout my stay. Im sure i will continue to book the Lupita, the price is right and im welcomed with smiles and hugs.

One of the biggest things that no one mentions in the reviews is the fact that this resort is totally geared towards French Canadians. The 2 main languages spoken at the Lupita are Spanish & French. English is the 3rd one. It was hard to talk to others if you didn't speak their language.This makes it very difficult to meet people which we look forward to doing when on holidays. Our 1st night there - the room was very musty and moldy smelling and I had an asthma attack which I have rarely had. We asked to be moved in the morning but the girl at the front desk did nothing for us. When our Sunwing rep finally showed up in the afternoon she spoke to the management and had them give us a new room - which was not musty and we were ok with it. We had asked to be moved to one of the other Riu's but the rep would not help us out. We would have spent $1000.00 more to move to a different hotel if we could have.The Lupita is very small, there is only one public bathroom with 3 stalls for the entire resort. I waited in a line up more times than I care to remember, whether we were at the bar in the evening or the buffet or at the pool in the day time. There are 3 small pools and they are small - 1 very small children's pool, 1 sort of adult only pool and one main pool that has blaring music and screaming entertainers at it all day long. We did read about this in the reviews but had no idea how ridiculously loud it would be. There were never enough loungers at the pools, only 1 day we're we able to find 2 together but then it was so loud that we didn't stay. We eventually just went to the other Riu's instead and they were much better. A lot of people on trip advisor said they didn't mind taking the shuttle to the private beach.....they failed to mention that the shuttle is a rickety old bus - at least 30 years old and it does not have air conditioning. It is not a 5 minute drive to the beach - it is closer to 15 minutes and we always had to fight to get on it as other guest were extremely pushy and rude. Twice we didn't make it on because it was so over crowded and had to wait a 1/2 hour for the next ride and would still have to fight to get on. The beach was very beautiful and we did always find loungers there. We spent most of our time at the Riu Playacar - we found it was the best of the 4 we visited. It was a nice walk down the beach to go to 2 of the Riu's. So grateful we could do that for sure. The rooms at the Lupita are ok but they are old - the staff were pleasant but the language barrier was a problem. A fellow came to our room and was speaking to us in Spanish and we couldn't understand him - he just kept pointing over and over again and we eventually just let him in our room - he had wanted to look at our air conditioner? Very awkward as we had no idea what he was there for. The buffet was fine but when we went to the other Riu's the food there was much better with way more selections and much newer decors. We would recommend to others who are thinking of staying at this resort to really ask themselves what they want from a resort. We don't consider ourselves very picky travellers and have been to Mexico a few times before and loved our stays at 3 & 4 star resorts - this hotel is a 3 star in our opinion. We thought we had done our research well but we were not very impressed with our stay at the Lupita. We paid close to $1500.00 each and had expected more for that much money. Also - we booked with Sunwing Vacations and our flights both ways were delayed - over 3 hours one way and 40 minutes the other way - they didn't offer any kind of rebate or voucher for another trip. We got to Mexico almost 5 hours late and all they gave all of us on the flight was breakfast and a small snack. Everyone was very hungry by the time they got to the hotel at 8 pm that night....we were at the airport at 3 am for that departing flight. My husband is 6' 2\" and the seats are so small his legs were crammed up against the back of the seat in front of him for over 7 hours. We definitely won't fly with them again. West jet or Air Canada are much better. We stayed at the Lupita from February 25th - March 3rd. Can't say there was honestly much we liked about the hotel...We would not go back to this resort.", "Date": "March 16, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Eastbourne, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cFantastic Hotel!\u201d", "Author": "Yabasha101", "ReviewID": "UR125929902", "Content": "Just arrived back from a fantastic 2 weeks at the Riu Lupita. The hotel should recieve a lot more credit than what it does. The staff are lovely and really go out of their way to help you, Aldo and Vladimir on reception could not have been more helpful & made regular calls to the room to make sure everything is O.K. Food was absolutely fantastic, could honestly say we enjoyed every meal we had there which is unusual for all inclusive. There was always a wide choice of freshly cooked meats, salads, fruit, ice cream. One of our party had allergies but the head chef was fantastic and went out of his way to walk her around every evening to show what she was allowed to eat. Entertainment got a lot better as the holiday went on. The guys Oscar, Juan, Gabriel, Enrico work hard at getting everyone envolved in various activities throughout the day and like to get you up for a dance in the evenings too. We went to watch some evening shows in some of the other Riu hotels which tends to be a bit more professional - Grease at the Riu Tequila was brilliant! As the hotel is not on the beach there is a shuttle bus that takes you down to the beach club and also stops at 5th Avenue on the way, this runs every 30mins throughout the day. You can also use the Riu Tequila, Playacar and Yucatan hotels and their all inclusive facilities for everything apart from dinner. We enjoyed using all these different hotels and beaches but we actually preferred the atmosphere in the Lupita which was more chilled out and relaxing after a busy day. A taxi during the evenings to these hotels is only 70 pesos which is about \u00a33.50, set priced no haggling needed and taxi drivers will not rip you off like in other countries! We did the trip to Chichen Itza which was amazing. Our guide Alfonso was brilliant, so passionate and informative, we booked it through Thomson. A nice touch is the beer they bring round on the bus! :-) Also did the dolphin training day which was a fantastic experience not to be missed, just be aware that the photos at the end are an absolute rip off, $25usd for 1 photo on a dvd or $89usd pp for all the photos on a dvd!!! A lot of money when you've already paid \u00a3120 each for the day. We also went to Coco Bongo's on the Bar Crawl, Coco Bongos was really good the show was impressive but it was way too busy, you couldn't stand up without being pushed over or squashed it was very dangerous really when you think if there had been a fire noone would have got out! We are glad we saw it though. All in all we had a fantastic time and would definately return without hesitation, the hotel is very well managed and address and solve all problems immediately without having to wait until the rep is in next.

I've only recently returned from a two week stay at the Lupita and was extremely impressed with the service that we received during our time out there. (6th-20th February) We travelled with Thomson, from Gatwick. We'd initially planned to stay at a beach-front hotel but were actually swayed into staying at the Lupita, after reading some of the reviews - most likely, because of the untypical location of the hotel and the abundance of local wildlife. We arrived at the Lupita a tad later than initially expected, due to a delayed flight and found the reception staff that dealt with us, (Aldo and David) to be most welcoming, helpful and informative. An initial minor problem with our room, was quickly resolved (within 5 minutes) - this in turn, prompted a call the following night, to ensure all was well with our stay. (Aldo, as well as being a very helpful chap, was also something of a linguist - in the space of 5 minutes, I overheard him conversing in Spanish, English and German) Staff with these skills, are to my mind - like gold dust. I hope the managers at RIU realise this? The staff, in general, it has to be said, were very attentive (more so - if a small tip (propina) was given) It may only have cost you pennies but it was always gratefully received and ensured that you were more likely to receive regular 'top ups' - especially when in the restaurant. The bar staff - were extremely efficient and few people waited any length of time. The local wildlife that frequented the hotel grounds - namely, the friendly coatis and the slightly nervous agoutis - were an added bonus during our stay. We spent lengthy periods of time watching their cheeky antics and despite being discouraged by hotel staff to feed them - we DID. (Shame!) To be honest - it was extremely hard not to feed them - after all - they're cute little critters! The regular, free 5-10 minute bus trip, to both 5th Ave and the beach club, as has already been mentioned - ran with military precision - leaving on the hour and half hour from the Lupita. Despite this precision - one of the drivers still had the courtesy to wait for an elderly couple, who had forgotten an item and had to 'sprint' back to their nearby room to collect it. I personally, did not always utilise this service. The hotel's surrounding neighbourhood - including the golf course - is very pleasant indeed and on a number of occasions, I chose to walk back to the hotel. (It IS, after all - incredibly easy to become overly sedentary on an all inclusive holiday) Quite frankly - I didn't want to return home to the UK, a stone overweight. I probably still did. Haven't had the nerve to weigh myself yet. Anyway - THE RIU LUPITA Great (hard working & proud) staff Great service Plenty of great food - something for everyone Great ambiance (Very friendly - intimate hotel) Courteous and punctual shuttle-bus drivers Lovely location (away from all the trenchermen/women and heavy drinkers, that seemed to proliferate the other beach-front hotels) If I had any gripes at all about the Lupita - they are as follows and not in any particular order :- The Pool-side music, could have been more relaxing and varied. Occasionally, It WAS but all too soon - music you could march to, had replaced it. There's some fantastic mellow Mexican music out there. It should be sought after and played by the pool-side. When you've travelled half way around the world - it's nice to be able to put your feet up and relax. You can't do that with Mariachi band music, trumpeting into your ear-hole. I'm all for that kind of Mexican music . . . but in the evening. : ) There WERE occasions, (daily) when, (as 003MGS pointed out), it appeared as though a Eurovision 18-30 It's A Knock-Out, was about to commence, pool-side. This was usually, after a rendition of the Lupita Hotel song - \"Uno, Dos,Tres . . Lupita\", had been sung. As above - some folk just wanted to chill mid-afternoon and not be dragged screaming from their sun-lounger, to perform belly-flops into the pool. Refreshing, though, it must have been. ; ) I do have to admit, however - that some of the arranged antics, on the odd occasion - were quite amusing. : ) Final gripe - Despite us double locking our hotel rooms - invariably, we later found our room door only pulled to, after the cleaners had been in. (NOT always) But . . . I would have thought that they would have left the security of the room, as they had found it? NO complaints, whatsoever, about the cleaning though. The room didn't really require attention everyday but they always made a tidy job of it - and were duly left a daily propina,. All in all though - and despite my seemingly whingeing gripes at the end. I LOVED this place. Leaving it - I have to admit - WAS painful I loved the friendly, intimate nature of the Lupita. (We visited all of the other (non-palace) RIU's and didn't find anything remotely, resembling the same ambiance) Within days of arriving home, I found myself scouring the internet - looking for another great deal, that would take me back to the Lupita. Don't be put off by any seemingly, unbelievable deals - this place, is a little gem. Snap up any deals. You WON'T be disappointed. And IF you are - you've been incredibly unlucky.", "Date": "March 5, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Weymouth", "Title": "\u201c\"What a very special place\"\u201d", "Author": "SnertWeymouth", "ReviewID": "UR125548124", "Content": "Booked two weeks with First Choice seven weeks ago, got back last thursday 01/03/12.

Paid extra for the Premium Seats, which was great but the seat was hard on the bottom especially after 11hrs of flight!! Transfer from the airport was just under an hour & the coach was air conditioned with the tour rep selling ice cold beer \u00a32 or water \u00a31 in english or Peso's-very welcomed. On arrival at the hotel you are met by a duty manager who tells you all about the hotel in about 5mins, you are fitted with the wrist band & handed an envelope containing the room key & safe key with the lock barrel. There should also be a plastic credit card size(make sure you check) voucher for each person to collect a beach towel from a seperate kiosk near the outdoor stage. You can change this towel daily at the kiosk. On check-out day return your towel in exchange for the plastic card to hand in at reception with all the keys. The luggage is brought to your room by porter, nice to give a little tip! this goes a long way. The room is individually air conditioned by a 'through the wall unit' which can be a little noisy but is certainly needed as its really hot. There is also speed controlled ceiling fan above the bed which gives a nice breeze. Bathrooms are either bath/shower over (block 28) or shower only (block 21). There are more blocks but I don't know their setup. Each has a hotel style hairdryer and 110v shaver point which will not power a uk hairdryer so if you have lots of hair you will be there a while. Each room has 50 channels of TV with some interesting classic programmes dubbed in Spanish which makes you laugh when Homer Simpson speaks in a strange voice 'hola'. BBC world news, CNN, and a channel which continually shows CSI New York etc. all in english. THE MINI BAR - filled every 2 days, 4 bottles of beer, 2 Pepsi, 1 Diet pepsi, 1 Sprite, 2 Canada Dry club soda, 3 x 1.5L of mineral water....1 litre of Vodka, 1 litre of Rum, 1 litre of Gin, 1 litre of Tequila - yes litres!! all included. Food is served buffet style for breakfast, lunch & dinner. There is plenty of choice but it is spread about over a large area so nothing is together i.e. cereals in one place, milk 30' feet the other side, each night has a different theme as such with a few gems during our stay with hand carved chickens, Sushi, Smoked Salmon, & rare roast beef an another night. Plus the usual Pasta, Salads & Rice. The fish fillet is excellent just simply grilled and was available every lunch time & no bones!! The layout you do get used to after a couple of days & you start to find everything much easier. There are two on the spot cooking stations where chef's will prepare omelettes & pancakes while you wait at breakfast plus grill fish & meat lunch & evening. The a la carte Restaurant needs to be booked at breakfast and is worth a visit if only for the steak. The Bar is situated next to the Pool with drinks served in Plasic tumblers up to 7pm & then in proper glasses after. The draught beer is Dos Equis which is a draught 4.3% lager to be fair is good when its ice cold & fizzy, but rank when it gets warm - so drink quick! you only get half pints unless you take your own container which some did. Local spirits, cocktails & soft drinks are served together with Tea, Coffee & Hot Chocolate. All Cola & minerals is draught dispense not cans or bottles unless you bring them from your mini bar. They do have some brands - Smirnoff, Bacardi, Beefeater & Johnnie Walker (red label) but you must ask for them by name or else you get the house brands. Entertainment was available during the day around the main pool & at night on the outdoor stage, the 'Animation' team work hard to impress but due to the multi-lingual explanations it becomes a bit like Eurovision commentary or Jeux sans frontier if you can remember - it's a knockout in Europe. I have been frank & accurate on describing everything above but this really is an exceptional fantastic value for money place. The RIU Lupita really does have a truly nice friendly feel about it due to one major thing - THE STAFF they are genuinely helpful, appreciative, funny & everybody says hello when you see them - even the gardners @ 5am when they are weeding. This all stems from the Management who are in my mind the best I have met, they are continually checking the quality of the resort, the gardens, food, rooms & swimming pools. You are welcome to tour the kitchens which are spotless and they are present and approachable it seems all the time and eager to please. They deserve a large amount of praise as it is evident they certainly run this place well - it's a credit to the RIU brand.", "Date": "March 1, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cEnjoyed this fantastic holiday !\u201d", "Author": "Graciewacey2431", "ReviewID": "UR125331115", "Content": "Just come back from Mexico today really enjoyed it .

I really didnt know what to expect based on some of the photos that were posted, but we were not dissapointed in the least bit. The RIU Lupita is one of 4 or 5 Lupita's in the area and it is not directly on the beach. For some this is a deal breaker, but for us it was nice as it made the resort a bit more secluded and quiet. Also, because you get access to most of the other RIU resorts, it was not a bid deal to head to one of them and use their facilities while on the beach. If you are looking for a party atmosphere or a place directly on the beach, this is not your place. Here are my Pro's and Con's: Pro's: 1. Excellent service, very friendly staff and attentive to your needs. 2. Very clean resort. 3. Free shuttle to 5th Avenue and RIU Lupita Beach Resort. 4. Food was good and well above average for quality among mid price range all-inclusives. 5. You get full bottles of tequila, rum and vodka in your room. Bar selection is quite good. Con's: 1. Beds are very hard. 2. No pool bar. Wasn't a big deal though as we did not get into the pool. 3. Though the Animation staff is wonderful, the shows just fall short. I have not come to expect much from shows at all-inclusives, so I really did not have high expectations here to begin with. 4. The shuttle runs every 30 minutes, so if you miss it, you have to wait around. This isnt so bad if you are at the resort, but if you are at either of the pick-ups, you get stuck standing around for quite awile if you miss the shuttle. It really only takes about 15 min for a round trip, so 15 minute intervals would work better. 5. The Lupita beach club is fairly small, so most will go down to the RIU Yucatan. It is about a 15 minute walk to get there. It would be nice if the shuttle made a drop off at all the RIU's you get access to, including the Yucatan. Bottom line is that the Pro's definitely outweight the Con's. Sure there are a coupel inconveniences, but plan accordingly and you can minimize those inconveniences. The RIU Lupita gets a solid 3.5 star rating from me and I would highly recommend it for folks who are not there to party at the resort, are looking for a nice secluded resort, want a very friendly staff and do not mind not being on the beach.", "Date": "February 22, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Taunton, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cFourth visit, and still as good as ever\u201d", "Author": "Phil-Somerset", "ReviewID": "UR124871985", "Content": "Excellent service, great food, friendly staff, and quiet location.

The food was great, we didn't get bored of the food even after two weeks. The food at the mexican a la carte was excellent. One of the best things about this hotel is the free shuttle bus, it takes you to 5th avenue and to Riu Palace/the private beach club for Lupita's guests. We used to walk on the beach to Riu Playacar and Riu Yucatan where we could choose between the pool and the beach, and the food is much better than at the snackbar at Lupita beach club.

Was a little hesitant because of course, this resort is not on the ocean. I would actually not hesitate to return because of the wonderful time we had. The ocean front was not really missed because they have a shuttle that always runs ON TIME every half hour, and takes you right into either 5th avenue, or to the Beach Club ocean front. Check in was well organized and we were more than happy with our room - main floor close to the quiet pool. The room was perfectly fine and very clean. No issues throughout the stay with the infamous \"stair window\" being seen from the outside. Just pull the shower curtain - not a problem. Bar was well stocked as was the fridge! Room was always cleaned in the morning after we came back from breakfast. This is a first in all my times away and was really a wonderful treat. We laughed at and enjoyed the various towel art the staff took time to provide in the room. No issues with the room at all. Beds were very comfortable. Pools were well-maintained and quiet due to a lot of folks heading off to the ocean (including us!). There was a main bar that you could get your drinks throughout the day if you chose to remain behind for the day. Towels and cards not a problem. Beach club was a short walk from the road and provided a combination of shade and sun, and of course beautiful blue ocean! Choices for lunch were more than fine, and quite good in fact, with fresh fish at times and as well chicken, and some cold options such as cheese, fruit and etc. Only alcohol at the beach club is beer and Pina colada. Soft drinks, water provided. If you wanted more you could walk 5 min. up the beach to one of the other Riu properties. Those of course were beautiful, pools were great and tequila was good! No complaints. Food is important to most, and I found this to be the best buffet and variety of anywhere I have been. There was nothing else I could have asked for and was always well prepared and fresh. We did go to the Mexican a la carte, but honestly, we would have enjoyed the buffet just as well. I am not a huge fan of buffet food, but there was always something different you could choose and it was always delicious. Home made soups always available. I found service to be a little lacking if that was important to you. More attention paid to larger crowds. I often got my own coffee, drinks and etc. I have no issue with this, and in fact prefer not to be fawned over, so I have no complaints about this really. Quality of food etc. is far more important, as is cleanliness. We took a day-trip to Akumal beach on our own and we were NOT disappointed. Took the shuttle in the morning into 5th avenue and caught the ADO bus to Akumal. This was easy-peasy and cost 18 peso. Got off at the stop, and walked to the beach - 10 min. walk - no taxi necessary. We had our own snorkels, but went to the Dive Shop right on the beach and rented mask and fins at a cost of 72 peso for each (total 144 peso). Snorkeled all day and took a break for lunch at Lol Ha, and that was nice with great guac. Many sea turtles, stingrays, barracuda and varieties of fish, squid all day long. It was beautiful and the beach was fabulous! After a long day, walked to the highway and as soon as we got there, Collectivo pulled up and we took that for 25 peso back to 5th avenue, and caught the shuttle back to the resort. The day was perfect and far less costly than taking a tour. As well, you can come and go as you please. The resort is a little smaller than most, but you get to know the fellow travelers at the resort and it made for an interesting little social atmosphere in the evening. The shows as usual were cute, sometimes a little silly, but always in good fun. One evening the vendors came in to sell their wares and we were able to get a nice souvenir of a photo on a shot glass and a small tequila bottle as well. English-speaking tourists were at a minimum at this time in November, but we managed to find people to chat with and had a great time! We caught the Mayan Riviera Jazz Fest on the Friday before heading home, and this was a real treat. Weather was perfect and the music was great. Walked back up and caught a cab home.

Riu Lupita was just perfect for us as we didn't spend that much time in our room hence luxury not being important. The room was clean, with a comfortable bed, hot shower, fridge full of drinks, a safe, a good variety of tasty food in the buffet, or you can book in the restaurant. Most importantly it was a nice, small, & very friendly complex, more so than the Tequila, Playacar, or Yucatan. The Lupita wasn't on the beach, however, they do run a bus every half hour from reception - the driver's lovely!. The first stop is 5th Avenue where all the shops are. If you don't want to be hassled just put the shades on, stare straight ahead & ignore, if you do then everyone is quite happy to talk & barter with you. Look out for the lads wearing pale yellow shirts & pale green shorts, they're Timeshare people & will offer you cheap excursions & gifts to reel you in. The second bus stop is the beach which is quite lovely, they serve food & snacks so you need never starve. If you continue to walk down the road when you get off the bus you will come to the Playacar Hotel, on the other side of the road is the Tequila, then back on the Playa side is the Yucatan, all within a slow 15 min walk of each other. We went to them all twice & enjoyed their more luxurious facilities & good food, which was only slightly different to the food at the Lupita. There are 3 pools at the Lupita, one large one where most people gather & participate in fun & games. There's a bar & a snack bar near by that opens at 10.30am. The second pool is smaller & for those that enjoy peace & quiet. The third pool & little park is for the very young children, so it's all fenced in & safe. There's loads of sunbeds so no one need go without, towels can be changed regular, & they have a small collection of books if you fancy a read. Oh & they have hammocks & I'm addicted to them! The reception area is quite nice with comfy seats & a restroom, free WiFi, a private room to make calls or you can just ring from the front desk, a room to store your luggage when you check out, a cash machine, also you can change your money for the Mexican peso, although if you look around 5th Avenue you'll get a slightly better rate. Oh & if you're an early riser & want coffee before 7am you can get that at reception too. Breakfast is served from 7am - 10.30. Lunch is 13.00 - 15.00. Dinner is 19.00 - 22.30. All of these meals are served buffet style. Or if you want to eat in the restaurant then you book the day before. The snack bar hours are 10.30 - 24.00. Disco is 10.30 - 24.00. You don't need to dress for dinner if you don't want to. We prefer to book our trips with the locals or DIY, as it's so much cheaper. Chichen Itza was amazing & we had a brilliant guide! We went to Cozumel on the ferry \u00a318 each & took a 2 hour tour round the island in a taxi for \u00a350. It was that or the glass bottomed boat & I really didn't fancy that after the oh-so-rough ferry! The girls were good though as they dashed up & down with sick bags & tissue - well done girls you do a great job! We visited a bird aviary which was just down the road from where the bus drops you off at 5th Avenue. It was small but very nice, \u00a315 each entrance. There's a Bus Station at 5th Avenue (opposite McDonald's) & you can use that to get to most of the excursions. We went to Coba thinking it would take 15 mins, we were on that bus for 2 hours & 15 mins! The entire trip & entrance fee cost less than \u00a325 so that was good. If you do use the Ado buses wear a jumper as it's very cold on there! Also we visited Xell-Ha & Xcaret, both were great but I prefered Xell-Ha. The map around Xcaret was very misleading & you often ended up going round in circles or going down a flight of steps & it a dead end - WHY? I got the impression that they were trying to make out that the park was bigger than it actually was. Tulum was beautiful & it's well worth a visit. But my favourite excursion was The Jungle Place, I'll never forget it as it was absolutely amazing! If anyone wants to contact me for more details on the excursions then please feel free to do so. Finally we had a fantastic time at the Lupita as there was so much to do & see! We stayed there from 8-22 December & the weather was HOT! Although we had rain it wasn't a problem. Do take your mozzi repellant or they will get you, if you've had chemo take extra care as your blood will be extra rich & they'll love you more than ever! They will still try & keep tasting you so buy some Gelmicin from the chemist at 5th Avenue as it's very good.

The reception staff had already assigned us a room but, after reading previous reviews, we asked for a ground floor room facing the quiet pool. The staff happily made the adjustment for us. Be sure to ask for a foam bed topper as anyone who has been to Mexico knows, the beds can be hard. The food never got boring and every night was a different theme. The servers were very helpful and we weren't lacking anything. Abel was very friendly and even tried to help us with our very bad Spanish. The entertainment staff work very hard to keep us happy all day and into the night. Our room was always clean and we definitely enjoyed the in-room liquour dispenser: Free rum, vodka, gin and tequila! The fridge was also stocked every two days with water, beer, club soda, and pop. A shout-out goes to Ronoldo and Blanca in the Tequila bar by the pool! The mojitos are deadly!! ;D One thing to be aware of: On the first morning we met with the Sunwing rep. She was very helpful but please don't buy any trips from her. Any trip from the resort will cost $99 US per person. Instead, take the free shuttle from the hotel (it leaves every half hour and stops at one end of 5th Ave, and goes to the beach club and back) and into town. Walk on 5th Ave. to the ADO bus terminal (similar to Greyhound in Canada) and buy tickets there. We bought tickets to Coba, Tulum, and Xel-Ha at a fraction of the cost. Taxis are a good way to go.

We're a family of 6 - 4 kids, 14, 10, 7&7.. so this was a family vacay. We picked this place purely on price, since it was a last minute deal, and life is short, so sometimes you can't afford not to go. Anyhow, the resort itself is relatively small, 1 buffet, 1 a la carte, 1 bar, 1 snack shack, 1 main pool, 1 'quiet' pool, 1 kids club. It's not on the beach, but they offer a shuttle that runs every 1/2 hr (between 7am & 6pm) that will take you to their beach club, where you can access the beach & another little bar/snack shack. It's walkable, but a bit of a hike, probably about 3km or so. From the beach bar, it's about a 5-10 min walk to the Riu Yucatan, the last available hotel, with the other two in between. It's in playacar, which is basically a suburb of playa del carmen, well, more like a golf course surrounded by hotels and condos. The food is ok, entertainment staff puts in work to keep things lively, and the hotel staff is friendly and helpful. As part of the Riu chain, you also get access to the Riu Playacar, Tequilla & Yucatan. NOT the two Riu Palace hotels. We spent most of our chill days at the other hotels because they're on the beach, and generally have more bars, restaurants, buffets, amenities etc... Not necessarily better, just more (so your never stuck without an open restaurant). The amenities at the other hotels are definitely more towards the 5star standard, which is why I wouldn't quite call the lupita a 5 star. I don't think there is anything too noteworthy, either good or bad about this place. I liked the mini bar, met lots of cool people, and enjoyed some sun. For the price, it was swell. I love this area of Mexico. There's lots to do, plenty of tours that can run you close to $100USD each, or you can rent a car for $60 and do alot of the same stuff for almost (or sometimes actually) free. You can swim with turtles at Akumal beach for free, drive up to Tulum and take your time at the ruins for $50MXN, or visit dos ojos and snorkel in the caves for under $10USD. Drive to Coba and check out the jungle or head south of Tulum and play on some of the most beautiful beaches in the world. Speaking spanish definitely helps if you want to go the do-it-yourself route. If not, maybe the tours work best for you. We avoided 5th ave with the kids cause it's a meat market and I'm the beef.

When we first landed in Cancun, there was a huge line to go through Customs and Immigration and after spending almost 2 hours at the airport under the most horrendous heat we were almost regretting our decision to visit Mexico. I WAS WRONG!! People, weather and facilities made it up for us! We decided for Riu Lupita because, compared to other Riu Hotels, this was the least expensive and more when we are travelling as a family of 5, we had read good reviews about the hotel and its staff and we were starving for a warm weather. Check in was really smooth and welcoming, we were offered a welcome drink that we really appreciated. Rooms were clean, spacious (not a four star room though, more likely our 3 star standard) but the housekeeping attendants did their best to keep the minibar well stock and beautifully folded towels on our beds. Animation staff was very nice, very friendly and always inviting us to participate with them in all the activities, arch and rifle shooting, pool and beach volley, bingo, etc. Shows at night were really nice, professional dancers that as I could see, train day and night to show us the best from their and other cultures. Food was Ok, plenty of Mexican food but not overwhelming, so, you can try a little bit of everything. Servers were extremely helpful and very happy with a $2 USD tip. This is not a beach front hotel, so, you can take the shuttle that runs every 15 mins to take you for a 5 mins ride to the beach. Nice beach with sun beds and a beach restaurant. If you are planning to go around and visit other Riu resorts (you are allowed to wearing the wrist bracelet) I would recommend you to rent a car. We did it from Easy Way Company, a Nissan for $200 CAD for a whole week! That was a great idea, we were free to go everywhere and not depend on tours. We visited Chichen Itza; 3 hours drive but were completely worthy! The Mayan ruins were superb and unbelievable! The only thing I did not enjoy there was the people trying to sell their stuff, it was too crowded with individual vendors chasing you with handicrafts, which were nice but too overwhelming. We also visited nearby small towns and enjoyed of the locals hospitality and friendliness. Being able to drive, we also visited the hotel Riu Resorts in Cancun. Riu Cancun was awesome; food was great, very testy the infinity pool was fab and the beach clear crystal waters! We visited the Cenotes: Natural caves filled with water, we were able to swim and did some diving, it was a nice experience for about $10 per people for 3 cenotes. All in all, we really enjoyed our experience in Mayan Riviera, the hotel was fine and it is definitely its people who make the difference.

Why want more?...\u201d", "Author": "luckyluc84", "ReviewID": "UR119038771", "Content": "My wife and I stayed at Riu Lupita for one week to celebrate our 7th year wedding anniversary. I will start by saying that this isn't the best party hotel so if that's what your looking for, stay in Cancun. Food: The food is excellent at the buffet with different themes every night. We tried the a la carte which was ok but found that the buffet was better so we ended up eating there every night. Room: There are rooms that were renovated but mostly the ones on the ground level. Our room was one of the older ones which we didn't mind as it was clean and comfortable. When we got to our room the A/c sounded like a bulldozer so we let Charlie from the reception know, the issue was resolved within one hour (Thanks again Charlie ;). Now for the beds, please don't expect super soft beds as they are very firm. We are used to a softer mattress and were able to sleep well on them but if you prefer a soft mattress I do believe they can provide you with a soft mattress topper but I cannot guarantee that as I heard it from someone else. Drinks: Drinks were excellent and the variety is good too. The drinks from the other Riu are a little better i.e bacardi instead of basic white rum and stuff like that but we still liked the liquor they had at the Lupita. STAY AT ONE ENJOY ALL 4: I'm writing this in bold because a lot of people don't know about it. Basically you sleep and eat at the Lupita but you can have drinks and snacks at Riu Yucatan, Playacar, Tequila which are closer to the beach. So you get to pay less to stay at Riu Lupita and still enjoy the other resorts except for the other buffets as you can only eat at the snack areas like around the pool or at the beach restaurants at the yucatan but we thought that, that was great because we only paid 600$ Per person instead of 800-1000$ to stay at the other Rius. Hotel in General: I would like to start by saying that this hotel including the grounds should be rated more like a 3.5-4 stars hotel. I believe that Riu purchased this small hotel to slowly bring it up to a 5 stars standard but that will take awhile. The main reason they rate it as a 5 star is that they almost have the same food and drinks than the other Riu\u2019s but don\u2019t FORGET...You\u2019re not paying the same rates so please keep that in mind. Beach: Not much to say about this, it\u2019s pretty self explanatory....JUST LOOK AT MY PICTURES ;) Resort Beer (I'm a man, this is really important lol): For those that went to these resorts a few years ago and had Corona in their room fridge or served at any Rius, don\u2019t expect that anymore as they changed their beer to Dos Equis which is a very good beer and similar to Corona (I almost preferred dos equis over corona). My wife isn\u2019t a beer drinker and even her liked that beer. Please look at my pictures for further information and sorry for any grammar mistakes I\u2019m not the best speller ;) Please feel free to e-mail me as I have pictures of almost everything but couldn't post them on.

When it's dark it is possible to look inside the rooms(windows are not very high) and see what is happening there! You can also see that from the stairs as you are walking by. Seriously, a major design flaw!!! Additionally, staff does cleaning every day from about 9:30-3pm and they would put their clothing bags,carts all over the buildings and outside of the rooms. Sometimes they would also just stand and talk very loudly. If I don't shut the door from the toilet to the room then you can hear it quite well(remember,the window...?) Because of those garbage bags and dirty laundry bags, it all didn't look very nice. I am sure there's a way to make it a bit tidy!! I travel a lot and never seen that before! Also, they tend to enter your room even if you have a DO NOT DISTURB sign. And THAT\"S pretty disturbing! There's also no beach nearby.

If you tend to not like heat, then either do not go to Mexico or do not stay at this hotel since all eating areas are open air (not indoors). When traveling, I tend to stay at hotels or resorts that are value-priced/middle of the road in cost so that I have other money to go on excursions and such. I would not consider myself a picky person, but I still found certain aspects of this hotel to be a little bit disappointing. Here are the highlights and the lowlights: -The front desk and staff were very hard working and courteous for the most part. -The spa services they have available are excellently priced. I got a 50 minute deep tissue massage for only $40 usd! -The entertainment staff was pretty good and kept you entertained, however unlike other hotels and resorts I have stayed, there is not entertainment throughout the entire day. -The pools were fairly large, clean and not too busy. -I was disappointed that the spa did not always answer calls to make a reservation, nor were there people at the spa desk/building when they were supposed to be open. -There is a limited selection of food available, being one buffet place called Adelita, a Mexican Restaurant that you must make reservations for, and a tiny snack area by the Tequila Bar. The food was okay all in all, but not as great as other budget all-inclusives I have been to. Plus, don't eat the pizza...not good! -We did not get towel creatures every day like many others have pictured. We only received one towel guy upon check in (I know this is a stupid thing to point out, I just thought they were cute hehe)! -The nightclub, \"Pacha\" never really had anyone in it... -The large size chess board was fun to play when it was not occupied. -The hotel was not right on the beach, with a shuttle running to both the beach and downtown. This sounds great in theory, however the shuttle stops at 6:30 pm. I wish the shuttle would run later. -We had issues with our air conditioner making such a loud racket, so they had us change rooms. Then the toilet in the second room did not act quite right and kept running. -The bathroom had a slat-like window. Once the cleaning people kept it open and there were mosquitoes all over our bathroom sink area. -One day nobody cleaned our room, so we had to call in about that, which took a little while for someone to come over. -You are given towel cards. The towel area is only open until 6 pm. This is another aspect of the hotel that could be kept open longer, or had a different method for towels all-together. -You had to pay extra for the use of the in-room safe, which I was not expecting. -The hotel stated they have wifi. While this is true, you cannot get wifi in the rooms...only in their open air lobby area. -There were many cute cats wondering around the resort. However, we only saw one coati and one rodent looking creature at the resort. We did see a scorpion as well! So, with all that said, we still had an amazing trip doing many excursions! However, I would have been MUCH more disappointed if I had to stay at the hotel every single day, as I feel there are very limited activities, food, etc. I think it is best to save your money (and some aren't that much more money...like Riu Playacar or Yucatan...we just booked too late to get these) and book an all-inclusive that is at least on the beach. Most of the other Riu's seem to have a more extensive restaurant offering as well. The shuttle to the downtown area was pretty awesome though, so I would recommend that. I think that this resort could be great with the opening of at least one other restaurant, a more extensive snack area (making sure the food was available all day long without gaps in time), and more availability to make spa reservations/take the shuttle/get towels, etc!", "Date": "August 16, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Ensenada, Mexico", "Title": "\u201cExcellent Hotel !!\u201d", "Author": "travelnut61", "ReviewID": "UR116684496", "Content": "This is a very nice hotel !

There are three pools, (two family pools and a kid's pool). They always had people, but did not feel crowded. There is a free shuttle that takes you to the Riu Lupita Beach Club, which is nice. It has a snack bar, beach chairs, under coconut palms. The shuttle also leaves you close to Playa del Carmen's fifth avenue shopping stores. You have to walk about 3 blocks.

We had read mixed reviews and were hesitant about the booking. I have to say that it was a little different but I would go back there. Here is what I conclude: 1. They are getting better each year with more knowledge. It seems that the Riu must have bought this place and is making it like the rest. The manpower is simply not there yet. \"Aldo\" at the front desk is great to work with. He works very long hours and I hope they give him a room for free to live in if he wants one. He was most accommodating to everyone that walked up to the desk. \"Loreana\" was his sidekick and she was awesome as well. 2. The one thing that I would like to see different is an enclosed restaurant. It is all open-aired. You eat outside every meal. With the heat the way it was kind of made it difficult to feel relief while eating. Even the restaurant that you make reservations for is outside. There is only one main restuarant and one for reservations. The snack bar takes up the slack in between meals. It is fast food type and does the trick. 3. The beach for the Lupita is a shuttle ride (short one) and it runs every thirty minutes. I have to say it is the best beach around. Water was warm, not crowded and people don't \"save\" the chairs like the Cancun Riu and never use them. It is very laid back and comfortable. We tried the Riu Playacar beach and the Lupita beach beat it hands down. They have a snack bar at the beach and restrooms. There is also a section with palm trees for shade with tons of chairs to use around it. 4. The Playa del Carmen shopping is amazing. You can take the shuttle from the hotel and they drop you within a minute of the experience. It is huge to see and fun to walk around. You can spend more than a day trying to see all of the shops. You can go \"cheap shopping\" or \"expensive shopping\" whichever suits you. They have it all. Definitely worth the shuttle ride. Takes about 5 minutes. 5. If you want to book a day trip to Tulum, etc, get it at the market instead of the hotel. The hotel is about 50+ dollars more than you can find it in Playa del Carmen market area. We used Easy tours and they were the cheapest around. NO bus, just a van and they took you to the place of your booking. No time share deal, just a ride and back which included the entrance fee to our place and it was great. We went to Xel-Ha which is all-inclusive with food and drinks and swimming and floating, etc. If you want to snorkel, you pay 20 bucks deposit and get it back when you turn in your equipment. Great time! 6. At the hotel, don't expect fancy. It is a typical beach hotel. Kind of on the \"run down a bit\" side but the hotel doesn't make your trip. The air-conditioning worked great and the bathrooms were clean. The minibar was a little on the \"scarce side\" but bottled water was plentiful and they have a contract with Pepsi. A couple of beers were in the fridge as well but no wine. No hard liquor was supplied in the rooms. If you are one to need it overnight, I would suggest you stock up at the pool bar and take it to your room. 7. The pool water at the hotel was warm. When I say warm, I mean bathwater warm. Or at least it was for two of the days that we swam in it. My daughter said that after the rain came, it was cooler but I didn't experience that. 8. We read that there are police everywhere with guns and that is true, BUT the complex is guarded and they screen every car that drives in and out. I would feel safe taking my daughter there by myself and recommending it to any single mothers. They didn't scare me at all and were quite interesting to see to boot! 9. The animals that walk around the hotel are fun to see. Take little pretzels--they like those! 10. The hotel is not a \"fast-moving place.\" It is very family oriented if you want a \"beach vacation.\" There is not a lot to do but swim, eat and go to the beach and of course, shop. They do have a day care for kids but I think it cost extra. It is a \"middle of the road\" hotel and service but I would return. I felt safe, they took care of us and seemed to like to do so, I just think the manpower is not there yet. If you are one that needs action all of the time, this is not the place for you. If you are one that likes to relax and go with the flow, you will totally enjoy this hotel. If you have small children, they will be safe here. One last tip: I would recommend a transfer from the airport to the hotel. We used Cancun transfer. It is a company and their website is the same name with dot com added to it. It was a little pricey but worth every penny. They are private, pick you up at the airport and take you straight to the hotel. No stopping at other hotels. They were also on time at 4 a.m. to take us back to the airport. \"Freddie\" was our driver and he was great.

TV was a bit messed up, lots of spanish shows (what do u expect right?!) No clocks anywheres! If you dont have a phone or alarm, you had no idea ever when things started unless you asked someone who knew. Drove us nuts! Had a few drinks, didnt really ever get a buzz on though. Sometimes entertainment staff got to pushy getting people involved, little language barries but to be expected. Beach club had like a 5 minute walk from where shuttle dropped you off, sometimes extra fees with water activities. Most shops in town had the same gifts in all them. The further you go in, the more mexicans bug you for money and to buy something. Waiting for shuttle sometimes sucked. Disco was almost empty at night. You can go to 2-3 other Riu hotels in the area but you had to walk a distance and couldnt eat at their main restaurants. Just wine and beer for alcohol at beach club.

Once I was dropped off at the beach club it was between 10 and 30 mins to walk to the other resorts, depending on which one you wanted to go to. I would recommend taking a cab from the Lupita to the Riu Yucatan instead of walking, it only costs $7.00 and well woth the trip.

The waiting staff go out of their way to help however. The rooms are a little tired; the air conditioning unit was very noisy, as was the room fridge which buzzed all night long. Perhaps a bit of carpet underneath it would help? We enjoyed the plentiful sunbeds around the \"quiet\" pool, but unfortunately for the first 8-9 days it wasn't quiet - the entertainment staff around the large pool (which is only yards away) played their \"techno-beat\" music very loudly and communicated with their followers by loudspeaker. This started every day at 10 am and by lunchtime we had had enough. Then one evening we were given a hotel questionnaire on which we commented on this, and the noise was toned down from the following day, so I suspect a lot of other people had complained. Having said that, the entertainment staff were excellent with the children who were there. Also, as the pool bar is the only bar at the hotel, this needs to be addressed. There is nowhere to sit and have a quiet drink; not everyone wants to sit in front of the stage and be compelled to watch the entertainment, nor did we enjoy sitting getting wet feet when the inevitable thunderstorms arrived during the day.

Sounds great in theory - and, with it also being my first time at an all-inclusive, I did have quite high expectations going in to the trip. I realise that you guys just want the details here so I want labour the points and keep it relatively short for you all. One thing I do want to point out though is this - THIS IS MY FIRST EVER REVIEW! I would never normally do this - but unfortunately PART OF THE EXPERIENCE WAS SOOOO BAD I FELT I NEEDED TO WARN EVERYONE OFF. POSITIVES ABOUT THE RIU LUPITA: 1) Great for kids - entertainment every evening, more emphasis on kids than any other type of traveller - I dont have kids so at times it felt a little like a posh Butlins! But, fair play, they look after kids well. 2) The location is pretty good - short, regular shuttle bus to the beach club where you get two other hotel / bar / beach activity outlets free of charge as part of the all-inclusive deal. 3) SOME of the staff are friendly and the maid service is excellent - top level cleaning every day for the rooms with new towels / sheets etc. 4) The pools and hammocks are a nice touch - there's a communal pool with daily activities / kids club and then an adult pool which is a lot quieter for relaxing. 5) Onsite golf course looked amazing + free tennis also 6) Onsite night club 'Pacha' was better than expected in fairness and quite good fun 7) The Dolphin Experience - TRIP OF A LIFETIME AND SUPERB - what a way to spend my 30th birthday!! NOW THE BAD STUFF - SORRY GUYS BUT IT'S ONLY FAIR YOU KNOW ABOUT THIS: 1) The food service is VERY POOR for what is listed as a '5 STAR' hotel - when on an all-inclusive, particularly when set away from the beach / shops, you have to rely on the restaurant options onsite. This was basically a buffet option all day - which to be fair had a number of different dishes each day (after 14 days though became very samey and very bland - a lot tasted the same!). Further, the only other restaurant onsite was the MEXICAN RESTAURANT - LAZY LAZY LAZY - this place served ONE A'LA CARTE MENU every day - exactly the same food - and very very second rate. Maybe I am speaking out of turn but when I thought Mexico, I thought , tastey nachos, burritos, fajitas etc....this menu was dreadful - raw, vinegared fish to start, a fusion of tomatoe and mushroom (in the same bowl!) soap that was luke warm at best and then 'chicken fajitas' which were greasy, tasteless and very fatty, completed by dry pancakes with a blob of ice cream. 2) The bedrooms resemble a 2-3 star UK standard - so ok but certainly no where near 5 star quality. Air con worked but VERY VERY LOUD and ceiling fan was hanging off the ceiling with wires showing!!! Also, the fridge almost outran the air con for noise so if you're a light sleeper it aint the best!!! 3) When you leave you get stung for tax at \u00a340 a person - nobody told us about this?!! 4) THIS IS THE KEY - I experienced complete and utter fraud during my trip I am afraid - I will spare you all the details but the key facts are as follows. When we arrived (travelled via Thompson) we were advised ironically on Trip Advisor not to book with the travel agent - so we went and booked our trips with the onsite scuba shop owner, Mattius. Now, think mildly arrogant, laid back scuba dude and you're close to the money with this man - to begin with the charm offensive sucked us in and he spent more time high fiving people than actually paying attention to what you wanted to do!!! Anyway, we booked the Dolphin experience & the 'Lobster Cruise' - circa $450 so not exactly cheap (and about the same price it transpires as what Thompson offer!). Little did we realise that, after my girflriend became ill a few days in with a cold / cough bug and when I got hit by the old 'Mexican Tummy', we decided to request the 'Lobster Cruise' be re-arranged to later in our trip - this seemed no issue and Mattius did as I asked. When the illnesses didnt clear up we decided it to be a little pointless shelling out the $200 on a cruise that wouldnt be great under the circumstances - so I tried to ask for a refund so we could go shopping instead. MEXICANS DO NOT UNDERSTAND THE WORD 'REFUND' So the saga went on and on and on and on....and is still going now....basically....Mattius with his slap-dash attitude refused to take me seriously when I asked for my money, claiming that I NEEDED A DOCTOR'S NOTE (A FURTHER $50 OUTLAY TO ME) to PROVE THAT I WAS TOO ILL TO GO ON THE LOBSTER CRUISE.....?!!!!! Despite several attempts to explain to him that at no point had he told me about this in the the event of wishing to cancel the trip he just fobbed me off. Losing out \u00a3130 is pretty lame by anyones standards and I duly complained to the Manager 'Beatrice' (pretty useless in truth and rude) and also 'Gerrardo' the supposed 'Director' who also lacked customer service and really didnt help much despite claiming he would resolve everything. 2 weeks on from returning from the trip I am yet to receive my refund - despite Mattius going through motions of 'processing it' via his archaic card machine and giving me a yellow slip as proof.

We got an awesome deal so we were concerned about the quality of the hotel, but once we arrived our worries were over. No, it's not a 5 star resort, but it's a great getaway. I have stayed at the Riu Palace RM, which was beautiful, but it took me 15 minutes to walk from my room to the pool. At the Riu Lupita everything was so convenient. There were always chairs at the pool, the buffet was never crowded, and the service was awesome. As for the buffets, I honestly couldn't tell a difference from the Lupita & the Palace RM...pretty much the exact same thing. We did go to the Riu Playacar to see if we were missing anything & after a few hours we were ready to leave. The pool bar was 3 people deep & it took forever to get a drink. AND the people sitting at the pool bar didn't leave the entire 2 hours we were there....kind of makes you wonder?????? Don't get me wrong, if you're wanting to get crazy & party, the Playacar would be a blast, but we were just wanting to veg by the pool/beach and this wasn't happening at Playacar. We couldn't even find a chair in the sun. The beach club for Lupita was also impressive. Anything you'd need for a day at the beach is available to you. Nice little set up!! All in all, if you want a cozy little resort with great service & food you can't go wrong. If you want a huge 5 star resort, this isn't your thing. I think you can't go wrong at any Riu resort.

It was great to be able to pick from 4 resorts for lunch or breakfast and for the pool beach areas. We were travelling with our kids and grandchildren and cannot say enough good things about the Victor and the entertainment staff. They always had something on the go for both adults and kids.

Don't even think of exchanging your pool towel for a fresh one during the day because it is not allowed...\"1 towel per day...Read the sign\". The stocked minbar consisted of 2 bottles of water and 2 cans of Canada Dry and the room safe costs an extra $3 per day.

Also, you can NOT eat at the other RIUs....(only snacks and drinks). On the good side, the grounds are beautiful (this is Playacar, everything is beautiful there), the staff work hard and try to please all guests, the food was OK for 3 days but after that I am sure it would get boring. The lobby is nice (very small) and there is usually a nice breeze there which is good since no AC. I have to agree with a previous reviewer that Riu needs to remove their name from this resort ASAP.

I must say when I read the review before going I was a little nervous as some of the reviews were not very good...First of this hotel is not a 5 star like some people like to think it is...it's a 3.5 star and a GREAT 3.5 star at that!! Those people who complained about this resort they must like the 5 start quality as I found nothing wrong with this resort!! This was my first vacation to Mexico and this hotel was EXCELLENT!! My only complaint is the rooms could use a little updating and the king beds have very firm mattresses....however you get used to it after a couple of days! If your not picky and don't sweat the small stuff don't then this is the resort for you:-) The resort is next to a water treatment plant but I didn't notice any smells at all during the day or the night like the one review I read??? We stayed in the rooms right behind the tennis court so the view I had from my balcony was the golf course! The staff at this hotel are EXCELLENT!! The servers, housekeepers and front desk staff are great. The entertainment team was GREAT!! They get you involved in all the activities and don't take no for an answer..lol, If you prefer not to be bugged during the day use the smaller pool as it is quite. The shows at night were FANTASTIC...highly entertaining!!! Being Canadian we are definitely the Minority - all the other guest were European so none of the other guest spoke English! It's a definite asset to know Spanish. The majority of the staff on the resort speak English. The shuttle to the beach and Playa Del Carmen was great!! Never had a problem getting a seat on the bus and the shuttle came every 30 minutes. A taxi ride to Playa Del Carmen cost $5.00 American which we used twice during the evening as it's better to shop at night as it's not so hot. The beach club had great food and you can get beer or Pina Colada's at the beach club. The buffet at the hotel was great!! The selection was good and never got sick from the food. The mini bar fridge in the room was stocked every day for us. This is a family friendly resort as well...lot's of kids at the resort. The entertainment crew did a really good job entertaining the kids. The entertainment crew really go out of their way to get to know you during your stay and will often sit with you at meals.

If you are looking for a relaxing holiday with excellent food and service, then this is the place to be. However, if you like wild partying nights, then the Tequila is a better bet. What we especially enjoy about this hotel is that there is a \"quiet\" pool at the back, where we can lounge and read our books in peace. Those who want to be entertained stay at the main pool and there are always activities there. Not being on the beach is not a problem, as the shuttle bus is excellent and the beach facilities are first class. Evening entertainment is of varying quality, but the staff have great enthusiasm. The acts brought in are excellent, such as the Mayan show and the Mexican traditional music. We enjoy sitting in the bar area after our evening meal and enjoying whatever happens to be on. I cannot praise the staff highly enough. Many have been there since our first visit in 2005, which is a good sign. We do not tip until the end of our stay, but this has absolutely no impact on service. Room cleaning is thorough, with new artistic towel creations being left on our bed every day. Bar staff get to know our favourite drinks and anticipate our order. Again, this is without daily tipping. At our evening meal, one of the waitresses brought our drinks without being asked, once she got to know our favourites. Food is varied, with a huge selection. Even those who only ever eat pizza, burgers and chips are catered for, but why go abroad and not try the local dishes?

This review is hopefully going to better prepare other travelers and help them make an informed decision. This review written on February 13, 2011 Travel period Feb 3- Feb 10, 2011 This review is for the Riu Lupita 4 Star resort in the Riviera Maya (Mayan Riviera Cancun Mexico) Negatives: 1. This is not a 4 star resort, not even from a South American standpoint. If you expecting a 4 star resort you\u2019ll be disappointed. This is a 2 star at best. If I were the Riu resort line, I would consider dropping this resort to avoid damaging there high standards of accommodation that Riu is known for. 2. When we arrived there was no welcome and they had trouble finding our names because of the language barrier. After we signed in there was no one to direct us or help us get our luggage to rooms. Luckily we were on the third floor and go to lug all of our luggage up the stairs. We were hungry and thirsty and there were no services open or available to us. The resort was dark and we only got a vague direction of where our rooms were. One of our doors didn\u2019t open which necessitated another trip back to the front desk. Keep this in mind if you are going to be a late arrival. We noticed other guests had service to there rooms during the day. 3. The food is the best we\u2019ve had from a buffet style resort but still lacks refinement and service. There were 2 occasions where we found under cooked hamburgers and chicken that we took back and let the staff know. They immediately started to cook the food longer in response. Be careful to check your food for thoroughness of cooking with sensitive foods like hamburger and chicken. 4. Drink and beverage service in the restaurant is slow and you end up getting your own beverages to save time. 5. There is no such thing as a hot cup of tea or coffee. It appears this resort has no comprehension that tea needs to be made with boiling water. You can expect lukewarm tea and coffee at best. 6. Dinner service starts at 7:00 pm, which is late and might conflict with your schedule. We had this problem with our departure day and didn\u2019t end up eating until we got food on the plane at 1:00 am. This is a problem when you have kids. The resort was unwilling to accommodate us except with recommending the snack bar. 7. The shuttle bus that takes you to the beach and shopping area makes it\u2019s last run at approximately 6:30 pm. This will likely interfere in your schedule like it did with ours, and you end up just taking a taxi. Which means if you are interested in eating dinner in another Riu resort, the dinned is after the last shuttle scheduled run. Keep this in mind when planning. 8. The shuttle takes you to the Lupita beach club and it is a nice club. Again, the shuttle schedule can interfere with wanting to stay a little later at the beach club so expect to take a cab. There is no beach towel service, so the towels you take are the ones you use all day wet or dry. Riu Lupita also has a one-towel exchange per day rule, why I couldn\u2019t say but this is very irritating using a wet towel all day. Also, if you go to another Riu resort and try and exchange towels they won\u2019t accept it, so plan ahead and know what to expect. Not exactly 4 star service. 9. There is a definite shortage in beach loungers for the Lupita beach club and the other Riu resorts during nice weather days. We tried to borrow loungers from the neighbouring resorts and were ordered to return them. We had to wait and scrounge for loungers and it definitely puts a damper on the day\u2019s activities. Go early as possible to try and secure loungers. 10. Bar service can be extremely slow. It seems like the resort is trying to save money by keeping as few bar tenders as possible available. The wait for a drink or coffee in the evening was up to 15-20 minutes at times. The bar tenders were very good once they got to you. Tips do not improve the service because of the volumes that these bar tenders are trying to keep up with. 11. Our room smelled like sewer gas and we couldn\u2019t get rid of the smell. By the time we realized the smell was not going away, we decided not to complain and get a new room and just live with the smell. None of our friends other rooms had this smell. 12. Our TV did not work very well, and we did not complain and just accepted the minor inconvenience. 13. The mattresses are the hardest I have ever tried to sleep on. I think the floor is softer. There are mattress toppers available that mitigate this agony. Make sure you ask for it as soon as you get there so you can sleep more comfort. 14. During colder or raining weather, the resort did not turn up the heat of the pool so enjoying the pool even during overcast days was not that easy. 15. During raining weather, there is not enough room under cover to accommodate guests during the shows. We ended up moving our own tables and cleaning them so we could sit under shelter. 16. WiFi service is limited to only the lobby area and slow so keep this in mind. 17. There is an extra charge for the room safe which seems odd to me. The cost in not too high less then $20.00 for the week but a hidden cost unless clearly stated in your room contract. 18. There is no beverage service to you table near the bar or pool area. You must walk to the bar and wait in line for you drink. We were OK with this except when there were extended wait times. This resort could really use another bar or more bar tenders. Extending service to poolside and during night shows would reduce the congestion around the bar area. 19. The last day at the resort is where we were really disappointed in the management and problem resolution of the resort. We exited our rooms before 11:00 am as requested, we prepared ourselves for a late departure in expectation of receiving a room for a final shower and change before our journey home. We were told to go to 2 rooms, one was for women, the other was for men, we didn\u2019t like this idea but they wanted to charge us for a private room for 7 of us to shower. When we go to the rooms, one was occupied and the people wouldn\u2019t share the room. We conceded and decide to try and just use the one room between all of us and shower and get ready now is less than an hour. The room had no soap or towels so we called the front desk to explain the situation. The front desk did not come down to investigate, or did we get towels or soap. The 2 people that showered thinking that towels were coming ended up drying off with T-shirts and washing with shampoo. Other changed on the balcony while other tried to clean up using wet wipes. No less than 5 calls and 2 in person visits to the front desk were attempted with no results except the manger (Ana Lopes) getting rude and giving us an attitude. We concede again with the understating we would submit a formal complaint to Sun Wing, which we did at the airport. The Sun wing rep said they would call me and so far no contact has been made by Sun Wing. If I were a resort firm like Riu with one of highest industry standards, I would not leave a manger like this in charge. All it would have taken was a short walk to the service rooms, assess the situation, and simply open up 2 rooms so we could wash and change. The cost to the resort would have been minimal. Poor management skill at best. 20. The resort took our luggage and placed in a \u201csecure room\u201d they issued no baggage claim tag. We found out when it was time to collect our luggage that the room was a free for all and all you have to do is walk in alone and take whatever you want. In other words, not secure at all so do not trust this service as secure. When we tried to explain this to the manager she seemed totally lost. Maybe if I put in a claim for $6000.00 worth of camera equipment she would understand better. Luckily we did not loose any items. Positives: 1. The shuttle bus is a nice free option that we used a lot. The bus is on time and makes only 2 stops, one at the beach club, and one at the shopping area so be aware of this. 2. Very quiet resort, best suited for 50+ travelers. 3. Food was decent except for the few under cooked items. Variety was fair and the staff are accommodating and friendly. Do not expect hot coffee or tea and tips do not make a difference. 4. The beach club is very well done and well stocked except for towels and beach loungers. The beach and water is likely the best in the world. Beautiful water and sand, which explains the popularity of the beach. 5. The drinks available are very nice but there is no beach drink service available for any Riu resort that I could see so expect a walk up to the resort each time or bring a thermos from your home to save on the walking times. Wait times can also be long at the bar at other Riu resorts we visited. 6. The large pool was nice, and the small pool looks like no one visited and was a distance for services. They had activities for visitors and we took advantage of some of these games and had fun. 7. The rooms have a mini fridge stocked with pop and a few beers at no extra change. We found this nice. There is no in room hard alcohol dispensers in the rooms like advertised but this was not a problem for us. 8. The majority of the staff were excellent, polite and friendly and eager to try and please. We enjoyed their company and I hope they enjoyed ours. 9. There was never a moment where we felt unsafe and it seems like security in the Riu resorts and the whole Mayan area is tight and controlled. 10. Shopping on 5th avenue is fun and all of the Mexican vendors were very polite, helpful, friendly, and loved to joke around with a typical Mexican twist. 11. Night shows and the entertainment staff were good and put in a genuine effort and we enjoyed the shows we watch. 12. Our rooms were kept clean and we even had trouble leaving the tip for the housekeeping staff because they wouldn\u2019t take the money. 13. Drinks at the bar were excellent and the bar staff tried to make each day fun and loved to joke around. Conclusion: This is not a 4 star resort. If you are expecting a 4 star resort you will be disappointed. If you go into this expecting a 2 star resort, and pay accordingly by booking while on sale, you\u2019ll love it. I went expecting a 4 star and felt it did not measure up the to high standards of the Riu name or the coveted 4 star rating. With that said, we booked this on sale (less the $1150.00 Dollars) and felt we got fair value. If it were not for the last day\u2019s confusion, and the inability of the manager (Ana Lopes) to resolve a minor problem we all would have left with a very positive experience. I would NOT recommend this resort unless you can book it for less then $1000.00, and I, as well as all the people we traveled with, will likely avoid this resort in the future. I think I would rather pay a little more and receive a better resort experience.

I approached the desk to speak with the manager (Ana Lopez) about not securing the room she rolled her eyes and shook her head. 13) Hospitality Room was a joke!!

The nice man tried his best to help us, but had no idea himself where our rooms were. After a long day and rowdy flight, all seven of us trying to figure out where the heck our rooms were for what felt like 1/2 hour. We then had to lug our luggage up to the third floor in the dark and the best part was that our key did not work properly in our suite.. BAD- After 3 days of calling the front desk ( about 7 calls) beceause the free in suite bar wont work and the bathroom plug doesnt work, I went dont to the front desk to ask what the issue was? I told them \"my wife is blowdrying her hair and putting on her makeup on the bed with the mirror I pulled off the wall for the 3rd day, and as well as the free in suite bar luke warm as the tea and coffee they serve you in the dining room\" you can imagine my fustration.They apologized and said that it will be done in a minute. (ya,maybe a mexician minute) My wife and I went to breakfast , then 5th ave to return and it still not work,, needles to say after another phone call from my wife this time he showed up fixed the problem in less than 2 seconds, and then held his hand out waiting patiently for a tip.... really???? BAD- The worst of the trip was hudge ATTITUDE we endured from a lady by the name of \"Ana Lopez\" she was the manager of the front desk. who did nothing but roll her eyes and make our lives a missery a few hours before we left to go home. All we needed was a few minutes in a hospitality room to freshin up and put our warm clothes on for our trip back to Canada; not so easy!! Ana expected all 7 of us the seperate females in one room and males in the other. Okay so now I get to shower in a dirty tub and change in a room with strangers. Well that didnt even happen the females in our group got locked out and shunned by another family. So all of us are now in the male hospitality room with \"childern\", showering in a dirty shower and changing in front of each other.The hospitality room had NO towels, NO soap and calling the front desk for help for another room did not help us!!! Clean towels or the soap will not be sent to the room efficiently, she really doesnt care that the family next door wont share. Ana Lopez was the icing the cake, apslolutly no compassion or reasoning with this woman. Ana Lopez was unprofessional, degrading and just plain ignorant!!!

Great!!!!- The bar tenders were very good to us,, always trying to please us, having our drinks ready before we ask for them.. allthough I think maybe only having one work the bar at one time isnt smart on behalf of the resort. Up to 15 people are asking for there drinks and he is running around like crazy trying to please everyone..I think that having 4 bartenders run the bar would keep the cutomers happy,, hello???

Rooms were fine but request a mattress topper if you dont like the firmness. The location is key, there are only 200 rooms to choose from. Rooms in the 2000 block are quieter. I stayed in 3100 block which fronts on the quiet pool but backs onto the resturant. Activity starts there early in the morning. Checked out rooms by tennis courts but there was a smell from the golf course lagoon which is behind it, never really figured out if the sewage treatment plant emptied into the lagoon. Saw lots of ducks swimming in it., though. We had emailed in Spanish, directly to the front desk requesting ground floor rooms and with them all being together and we were accomodated. Maid service was good once I figured out how to tip to their expecations and spoke to the head of housekeeping about their services and what to expect. Towels only get changed by request ie put them in the tub. They are trying to save water so they dont change them every day, nor do they change the sheets. Only can get i beach towel oncea day. Nice free exchange of books and magazines by the towel hut where I picked up a few good reads. Internet was 4 US per thirty minutes or 7us per hour. The speed was pretty quick. However, internet cafes in playa del carmen were alot cheaper. Shuttle worked some days, not others. It was a drag waiting around with wet everything although you could bring clothes and change at the beach, most people want to shower. I was suprized at the amount of garbage on the beach, I only went there in the afternoons and maybe it was cleaned up every night but it is a very busy beach, if you want quiet beach time go to a more isolated resort furher down the coast. Too many jet skis and activity for me to relax. Hard to walk the beach as the shore is really on an angle. Heavy waves one day made it pretty dangerous to swim. Water was warmer then the pool. Wore beach shoes. Swam in marked out area for hotel next to the Rui beach club because didnt feel safe swimming around boats and jet skis etc in front our the Rui area. Glad I didnt hear about the Cancun shark attack until after I got home. Mixture of languages/cultures in the hotel was interesting. Lots of Brits, Dutch, French, Latin Americans, Not everyone friendly. Sat next to the staff table many times and listened to the Spanish management talk about the Mexican staff. It does help to speak Spanish to figure out what is going on behind the scenes. They did a hotel review while we were there. I saw managment talking to staff the next day about the results, it appeared they took customer feedback to heart. We spent the day at the Akumal beach resort to snorkle with the turtles, we had tried to book there for this vacation but it was full until march. Beautiful beachfront resort but the food did not measure up to the selection at Lupita. My father wandered around and could hardly find anything he wanted to eat At Lupital they have a wonderful juice bar, egg lady and crepe guy will make them to order, even meat guy at dinner will cook to order. The ice cream was great! They use alot of salt and most people I spoke to were swelled up retaining alot of water. We asked for things to be cooked without extra salt. I noticed when they are rushed that meats dont get cooked all they way through so sometimes I had things to feed the cats outside the resturant. There is lots of bird life, coati's seem to come and go from the property.Saw a few butterflies but not as many as i expected. We did see the guy do the chemical fogger for misquitos and he didnt use an mask and I am sure the chemicals are not what we would allow in canada. It smelled bad. Use the spa for a massage, they have regular specials, staff there are part of a franshise they dont work for the hotel but they were very professional and i get regular massages so I know quality. Can find cheaper massages in PDC if money is an issue Animation staff worked hard but focused most of their attention on the younger crowd. Never swam in the big pool at all but hung out at the small pool, more relaxing. only problem is red ants, they got into my bag and I got bitten several times standing at the side of the pool. Lots of fun walking around playa del carmen, it was interesting to see. I felt safe. Resort is clean and safe, never feared for my safety there, taxis were professional with seat belts., staff were friendly and helpful at the hotel. Tipping does influence the service you get. . Nothing to stop me from going back, but I will probably try a resort on the beach further down the coast next time.", "Date": "February 8, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "calgary", "Title": "\u201cIt is a 3 star hotel.\u201d", "Author": "rockyviewmd", "ReviewID": "UR95827449", "Content": "We stayed there from Jan 29 to Feb 6, 2011. We monitored its price closely and booked at once when they had some kind of promotion for kids staying free. It seemed that other all inclusuve resorts would charge 50% for the kids. 1. Location. RIU lupita itself was NOT on the beach but besides a golf course. Its free shuttle bus ran every half hour and had two stops. The 1st stop was near 5th avenue of Playa Del Carmen and the 2nd stop was on its own private beach right besides RIU PLACE RIVERIA MAYA's beach. The shuttle bus ran from 7:30AM to 6:30PM with 1 hour break during lunch hour. How to make good use of the shuttle bus would be a key factor if we would choose lupita because traffic time will be about 1 hour each day. You also need to carry the beach towel for the whole day. By the way, there is a sewage plant right in front the hotel. So you need to avoid the units in the front. 2. Star level RIU gives all their 6 hotels in this area as 5 stars. From what we saw, RIU place and RIU PLACE RIVERIA MAYA looked like 4-5 real star hotels. RIU playacar, riu yucatan and RIU tequila looked like 3-4 hotels. RIU lupita looked like 2.5-3 star hotel. 3. Room Small, tired, looked like a motel room. Tiny bathroom. We left the ceiling fan on for the whole day. Otherwise, the room would not smell good. Mini-fridge had bottled water, beer, coke. We left 20 pesos each day and they restocked it every day. 4. Customer service a. Lobby: They gave us direction and a map of Playa Del Carmen. b. Buffet: They were nice. But some servers only knew spanish. c. Entertainment team: They worked hard from 10AM to 10PM. They gave lupita the extra star. d. Cleaners: They dillegently clean everywhere. Generally speaking, they were very nice to the customers. 5. Food Above average. Tueseday evening's mexican night was the best. We did no have stomache issue during the whole stay. They were trying to have new food selection every day. Tropical fruits were our favourite. We went to RIU playacar and tequila for lunches and their food were identical. Their breasfast was exactly the same as RIU lupita. 6. Drinks RIU playacar had more choices than Lupita. 7. Beach Lupita's beach was small and had more shades. It was quite and had much less traffic. We spent 2 days on Lupita's private beach and 2 days on Playacar's beach. 8. Tours We booked Chichen itza tour($40 USD/seat) through a travel agent in Playa de Carmen. If you book through the agents in the hotel lobby, it will be $99USD/seat. We used the free shuttle to Playa Del Carmen. Then we took the collectivo (2 calle and 25 ave) to Coba ( 60 peso/seat), Tulum (35 peso/seat). 9. In summary, if you do not have kids, I'd say Tequlia will have better value. If you have kids and will spend the whole 7 days on the beach, Playacar will be better because Yucantan is much more crowded. If you have kids and will spend 3-4 days on tours, lupita may have better value. Shuttle bus brought some value to us because we took 3 tours and always began from Playa Del Carmen.", "Date": "February 7, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Toronto, Canada", "Title": "\u201cGood hotel, but ONLY 3 star. Not a 5 star. VERY DETAILED REVIEW included\u201d", "Author": "Yorsch", "ReviewID": "UR95446500", "Content": "This is not the first time we travel to Mexico. Actually this hotel was specifically selected because of it's close location to Playa Del Carmen - Best Place for Entertainment! Now there is going to be very LONG and DETAILED review. As i wish somebody would share it with me, before i went there. If it is too much too read, just skip right to the end to SUMMARY section. If after reading summary, you still tempted by the deal, go ahead and read the details. --------LOBBY-------- Right away we got disappointed from the moment we saw lobby. When other 5 star hotels look like you arrived into castle and their staff expects you with cold drinks right off the bus, this one looked like a little hut, and there was only 1 person at the desk. She was nice, but could hardly speak English. I know i know, you do not come here for lobby, but however it tells already what kind of hotel it is. Forget about bar at the lobby as well. Customer service was not the best. They were not rude or anything, it is just was not there. They seem careless, and unhappy. --------ROOMS-------- After seeing rooms i realized my feelings about the hotel were not lying. Rooms do not look nor feel like 5 stars! It was very clean, but very simple, outdated. Good bathroom, and nice terrace. Old and small TV, 2 chairs and small table. No couch. To my disappointment, there was no coffee/tea maker in room. Nor there was an Iron. However you could get an Iron from front desk leaving a $20 deposit, but no ironing board....Safety box is 3$/day. No robe, no slippers, gotta bring your own. There is a mini-fridge, stacked everyday with free bottles of pop and beer! Fridge and AC working very well, ice cold. --------FOOD & DRINKS-------- Since we arrived at 12 o'clock and had to wait. The only place was open at the moment was called Pachito. ... Yeah, this Pachito is just small stand with some burgers, fries and vegetables... There was only 1 buffet, with poor selection of food. They do not have any alcohol in buffet, except for wine and beer. Have to walk all the way to the bar and back to have a little drink with your meal. There was 1 La Carte. We did not even bother going there. The bars lacked with drinks as well. Since i am tequila drinker was surprised that they did not have the JOSE CUERVO - the most famous commercial Mexican tequila (You can get at RIU YUCATAN though. Dont forget: 1tequila, 2 tequila, 3 tequila, FLOOR) --------BEACH & POOL-------- Now, we knew that this is NOT a beach front location. You have to catch a shuttle bus, that comes only every 30 minutes, which seems like forever under hot sun, if you just missed it. The schedule is 7:00 am - 6:30 pm, and it takes 1 hour break around 1:30. The same bus will drop you off to 5th avenue @ Playa Del Carmen The beach is nice, BUT there was no free beach chairs. You had to scan the whole beach to find one. There was no entertainment. What seem stupid to me is that, there was no towel service on the beach. So you would have to grab a towel at the hotel, the take a bus, come to beach, then after you done take a bus back carrying the wet towel. It especially created complications, when after morning beach trip, people would like to go straight to Playa Del Carmen, instead of returning to Lupita to leave the towels, making double trip. Without beach, you would expect at least an amazing pool. If your dream is just to relax having drink in hammock by the pool, forget about it. There was one small pool full of kids, no hammocks, no wet bar. --------ENTERTAINMENT in Hotel-------- To be honest we did not stay one evening in our hotel, as we came mainly to enjoy Playa Del Carmen, especially BPM festival. However i saw their preparations, it did not look promising. The disco was worse than in Dominica. Small room with cheap light effects, with poor selection of drinks. It's always empty! --------GOOD STUFF-------- With the Lupita bracelet, you can go to 3 other RIU hotels, and fully enjoy yourself. RIU - YUCATAN (True 4.5 star) Amazing hotel. We all wished we came here to stay, even though remember that this one more pricey, it would worth it. The food is so much BETTER!!!! selection and quality! and the buffet itself is beautiful, right by gorgeous palace like Lobby, where somebody constantly offering you to try a drink, or local bartender will make you drunk. The beach is nice, so is Beach Snack-Bar. There is entertainment Team by the pool that would not leave you bored with their staff director Elvis King - champion of beer drinking contests, and Michael Jackson performer in the evening (Sorry for the spoiler, the guy is amazing) Very nice pool, with daytime water sports activities, and good wet-bar. There was an amazing show for New Years, as well as Michael Jackson show on other day. Lots of Bars spread throughout this hotel. RIU TEQUILA - We had chance only to visit the disco here. On New Years night it was amazing and packed with people. The other night though, not so much. If you just wanna grab drink and dance, then go ahead. However if you know your music, skip the place. There is also RIU PLAYACAR - we never visited it. RIU PALACE - This is IT! you can from outside it's temple like entrance. However drinking and eating here not included in your ticket. the whole hotel have different concept. This is more L.A. style condos. Very beautiful pool. -------- DISTANCES, TRANSPORTATION & MONEY------ When i saw this hotel on Trip Advisor, all I was thinking, how CLOSE is this hotel to Playa Del Carmen? About 20-30 Minute walk. or 5 minute walk from shuttle bus drop-off point. However most of the times you will go there in the evening, after bus hours, you will have take a taxi. From RIU Lupita to any other RIU or Playa Del Carmen is only 50 pesos, or $5. Another thing I would recomend to bring both currencies - US dollars and more in MEXican pesos. Preferably exchange your pesos in your own country, as you will get a better rate. Here are the rate differences in January 2011 At the hotel: 11.67 pesos for $1 USD When buying tour: 12.6 pesos for $1 USD On the street/stores/taxi: 10 pesos for 1$USD Difference goes up to twenty percent, and that can hit you hard if you are spending big money. So bring more pesos. There is always ATM machines with US and PESOS withdrawals. woth-case scenario withdraw money in pesos. You bank will give you better rate. --------STORES & TOURS------- Dont buy anything at the hotel gift shops, its all very expensive.All the gifts can be found on 5th avenue. the further you walk, the cheaper it gets. If there is no price posted on merchandise always bargain. If you dont like price just walk away. There is lots of other stores that sell all the same items. There is also more modern like \"outlet\" stores, which feel more like Mexican supermarket, with prices posted. You can buy alcohol here, as well as souvenirs. You might overpay on souvenirs a little, but will save you trip. BE EXTRA CAREFUL! All stores in Mexico carry policy YOU BREAK - YOU BUY. The people that seem like sales Associates, are actually people that watch who breaks stuff to notify them if they dont pay they will call Police... I am not sure about all the cigarets, but MARLBOROS were cheaper at airport Duty Free for 29$. As for tour, you can buy them at you travel operator at resort at higher price, or you can go Downtown and find a better deal. However there is lot of the little kiosks that sell you tour that look very suspicious. We did not trust them much, and end up going better looking place. That place was amazing. It was called SOLATINO travels, and was on 5th avenue, somewhere between 4th and 6th street. The person working there Mike, very nice guy, with fluent english, will fully explain you all the details and nuances of all the tours. This guys will tell you the best tours, hints and tips on how to enjoy it even more. Thanks to his tip, we went to an amazing Dolphinarium. He also suggested that we pick the 7;00 am schedule, since there will be less people, which will result in more personal time with Dolphins. Really recommend him. He wouldnt bargain with you though, as he already provides quality service at lowered prices. Here are Tour prices we paid: Delphinus -> Primax ( 1Hr with dolphin in group of 4-8 people) Range of activities -> 135$ - $20 (cashback) = $115 per person. Gorilla -> ATV + Zipline + Underground lake in a cave = $65 per person --------PLAYA DEL CARMEN-------- Don't be afraid to step out. This city is one of the most favorite places in the world. With it's 5th Avenue stretching for several kilometers full of specialty restaurants, bars, shops, souvenir stores. I fell in love with it since first time i saw it. You don't just sitdown at one place here. You Start at the beginning of the avenue. Just hop from one bar to another having one drink in each one. That's how it all works there. Bar & cafe hopping. By the time you reach 12th street, that's very the main FUN is. On north side you will find the MOST FAMOUS commercial attraction of Playa del carmen - COCO BONGO. You can their review on TA as well. Went there twice. it worth it. Just take it with Party Hoppers tour, instead of going yourself, since you will get better seats. If you turn south on 12th street, you will come down to the Nightlife heart of Playa del carmen. All the clubs are just come to life after 12 am. At 2 am it gets really packed on the streets. There are bar-clubs, and there are Beach clubs. The best one is BLUE PARROT. 2 rooms. Bring flip-flops as you will dance in the sand under the sky on the beach! If you don't get tired you get to see an amazing sunset on the beach. Club is open till morning. Every January there is also big HOUSE MUSIC festival - BPM FESTIVAL. Big names, lots of fun. ***SUMMARY*** It is not a bad hotel. Just dont expect an extraordinary 5* service, as I would give this hotel only 3*. It is al good, but very simple. If It is the little details of luxury that make it for you, avoid it. If you are less demanding, or the deal is too good, or if you wanna party at Playa Del Carmen and just need a room to sleep, it is perfect. Rooms are simple, but clean. Food is ok. Beach is nice, but shortage of beach chairs and rare bus schedule are little frustrating, since the pool is not as exciting here. Forget about the disco. I described above everything in details, as I wish somebody would have warned me beforehand, then I would rather spend extra couple bucks but stay at RIU Yucatan. I might seem a little picky, it just I might have been spoiled by the services the other 5* hotels provide, and this one was nowhere near it. I talked to people that were traveling for the first time, they liked it all. However, if you are exprienced traveler, please read and know what to expect.

We slept with the patio door wide open to the bush/golf course and I didn't have to wear ear plugs or an eye mask like some other all inclusives we've been to. I thought the food and drink were fine - enough choice for us and we had no stomach troubles at all. We took a an all day tour with a taxi driver \"Adolfo\" who approaches people outside the Lupita frequently. We did Coba, Choo-Ha cenote, Akumal beach and Cristalino cenote for the cost of $2200 pesos for the 2 of us. It was an excellent day, he is a nice and trustworthy man and even put on his wet suit and guided us in the water at Akumal to find the turtles. We did the 2for1 relaxation massages and I had a spa pedicure at Kristine's on 10 ave. a short walk from the shuttle bus stop at Playa del Carmen. They did a very nice job there.

The bad Food was the same everyday, never a change. Uncooked burgers made me sick Resort had a lot of ceramic for flooring so slipping and falling on your back is something that happens if it rains. The snack bar consisted of nachos and cheese Drinks were watered down This resort is situated near a sewage plant so the smell when the wind shifts is unpleasant. This was my first time travelling and did not expect much. What saddened me was that our room would not be cleaned unless we tipped over 5 american dollars. The good The staff everyone is so friendly The entertainment team so funny Victor and Oscar and George and carla made the shows. The location of this hotel is near all the clubs, shops and excursions The hotel is not on the beach but they provide a shuttle Even though your bracelet allows you to eat at the other riu's except palaces they are not walking distances and u have to take a cab hence they know you won't go to use there facilities. The restaurant that you need to make a reservation at was Garbage food, honestly the buffet is much better. Ide say the food here is table scraps off of the other riu's tables This resort consisted of families, couples and some young adults, if it weren't for the staff I would of changed hotels. I didn't expect much and I guess you get what you pay for. If you get hungry at night after clubbing you starve till the morning since there's nothing to eat at or near the hotel. If your looking for a basic vacation then this is for you, ide give it a 4 out of 10. I read the reviews and they are all pretty good so I'm sad to have to write this but it is my honest opinion. Lots of wildlife at this resort. What bothered me was the stray cats that lingered the grounds and jumped onto your table for a bite to eat if u left your plate unattended, even though I love animals and cats this was a bit gross. Mini bar in your room was cool. Pools were clean and grounds were clean. The staff is the reason I did not move. This resort is quiet, and dead after 12 at night so it is not for the young adults looking to party if so the clubs are a 5 dollar taxi ride away. Air conditioning was deafening at night. Overall I would recommend it to people who don't have a lot of money to work with if you have a bit more stay at the riu yucatan, its on a beach and very beautiful. Food was ecstatic. I hate really writing bad things about hotels because I was very excited to stay at this place but I'm not gonna falsify my review.

The hotel itself it's certainly not more than a 3/4 star hotel (therefore the lower price compared to the other Riu hotels in the area), but the staff adds an extra star to that. They are always helpful and trying to satisfy your requests as good and fast as possible. Playa del Carmen is great. The temperature was 28-30 degrees in December, the water was warm and there was always something extra to do (trips to the maya sites, to the islands, the parks around, etc). The hotel is not located directly on the beach, but the free shuttle, the beach club and the fact that you get access to the facilities of Riu Yucatan and Playacar (pool, beach clubs, bars, restaurants) was good enough for us. Walking to the center of Playa del Carmen was also not a problem (<30 min). The hotel pools are also a good option if u feel lazy - we've never had problems finding free sunbeds even when waking up late. The rooms were good and clean, airco and ventilation were present, the TV had a lot of english channels. (Free) WiFi was only available at the reception. The minibar was always refilled on time. The nights were quiet except some sporadic events with american/canadian youngsters returning drunken to their rooms and wanting to share this experience with the rest of the guests. But I guess that can't be avoided in the area. The food was very good (the NYE menu was excellent) with a lot of choice. The mexican restaurant was a bit disappointing. We've found the mexican evening at the main restaurant much better. The cocktails were great. The entertainment team is just amazing - not too pushy (like in other hotels in the area), but always present. We've enjoyed the evening shows which were quite variate.

We returned from the RIU Lupita, which presents itself as a five-star hotel on January 08, 2011 after staying there for two weeks including the New Year. We usually stay at 3.5 star hotels in Cuba or the Dominican Republic, but this time I decided to go to Mexico (Mayan Riviera) to see if it was worth the extra 25 to 30% that it costs. In addition, I wished to visit Chichen Itza. I chose the RIU Lupita, because it was part of the RIU chain of hotels and the reports that I read on Trip Advisor were very good. Unfortunately, the hotel is not up to RIU standards for accommodation, food and ambiance. Moreover, the reports do not reflect what we experienced. For this reason, I have included pictures to support our findings. We do not recommend this hotel; it is a three-star (Caribbean standard) hotel that detracts form the RIU reputation for the reasons that follow: Location The reports describe this hotel as being in the jungle and very quiet - a place to relax. Although the hotel is not adjacent to a beach, a regular shuttle bus provides service to the beach and nearby town. The Lupita supposedly has its own private beach club. In reality, directly outside of the hotel is a private golf club. 200 metres in front of the hotel is a sewage water treatment facility that provides pungent odors to the hotel; most noticeable through the bathroom window in the early hours of the morning. Then to the right and left of the sewage plant is a residential area. Behind the hotel is bush. Quite how the location can be described as being in a jungle escapes me. A shuttle bus services the beach club every 30 minutes. However, between 9:00 and 10:30 AM it is not always possible to get a seat, because of all the guests wishing to spend the day at the beach. As for returning to the hotel at 4:15 to 5:15, you will be lucky to get on the bus, yet alone get a seat. Please consider that we were there during one of the peak periods and I am sure it will be OK for the rest of the year. The reports I read about the private beach club were positive and stated how nice it was that the club is private. However, the club does not have a bar, but does have a beer tap, red and white wine barrels with taps and soft drinks. So forget having mohitas, pinicoladas or tequila sunrise, etc. There is a buffet with the same low quality food as at the Lupita. The real reason that this club is private is not to keep guests from other hotels out, but to keep you in. Next door to the beach club is the RIU Palace, a genuine 5 star RIU hotel with beach bar, cocktails, good food and all that you would expect from a RIU, but that is off limits to Lupita guests. Hotel Facilities This hotel is compact, if you were in the bar and there is only one, and you took a 20 metre length of rope, you would encompass the bar, the swimming pool, the restaurant, which is behind the pool and the stage area, which is to the right and next to the restaurant. Across the pool is a secondary Mexican (reservations only) restaurant. Behind the bar is a snack bar (Refer to picture). There is also, what has been called the quiet pool, where you can try to get away from the games and activities going on around the main pool. However, you will still here the voices \u201cI love Oscar\u201d from the entertainment team, because the quiet pool is about 75 metres from the main pool. Around the quiet pool are 54 sun loungers, so if you do not get one by 10:00 AM, you will not find one without a pink towel draped on it to indicate it has been taken. Hotel Room From the reports I read, I knew that the room would be in need of modernization, but what I did not expect was to be able to hold two of the 3/16 inch bed springs between my index finger and thumb, or to find a panel hanging down in the bathroom under the wash basin. I did get the mattress changed after several days. It also took three attempts to flush the toilet, but I managed to adjust the water flow to solve that. Further, the room was swept each day but the tiled floors were not mopped. Dried footmarks from the bathroom remained on the tiles for our two-week stay. The view from the rear balcony was not at all exciting, just a fence and bush. The view from the font was across the tennis courts. Food The food was not good, certainly no better than a three-star Cuban hotel. The problem was not in the manner it was presented, but was caused by using the low quality of ingredients. The restaurant staff made the food look good and the service was OK. However, I suffered food poisoning for three days and then my wife was sick for another three days. This meant we did not go to the restaurant for a full meal for six days. The restaurant is next to the stage area, but do not expect to be served wine or beer after you have dined and while waiting for the show to start. The staff want you out of there. Then you will have the problem that the stage is in from of the bar and all of the tables are taken, so nowhere to sit. This was not a problem for my wife and me, because the temperature dropped from its daytime high of 26\u02daC to 15 to16\u02daC in the evening and we went back to our room. Entertainment Can not really comment, because we only saw part of one show. However, the person who wrote that a band played Santana music every evening must have had more luck than we did. On one evening out of 14 there was such a band. Typically, during the day the entertainment team, which was male dominated, became annoying, because you could not escape their voices. In addition, because the hotel guests were 80% Mexican, we found most of the communications to be just a lot of noise. I asked some other guests what the evening shows were like and they said they were quite good. If you want to book a trip, do so in Playa del Carmen, it will save you half the price charged at the hotel (Sunwing/Signature) and the tour operator is the same. There is a travel agent on your right hand side as you enter to town. They offered to refund our tour money, because we were sick. We did not do this but changed the date without an additional charge ($44.99 US to Chichin Itza). One final observation if you want to rent a scooter or bicycle you can do this at the RIU Tequila hotel, which is near the beach club. The down side is they charge $40 US a day for a scooter and $9.00 US a day for a bicycle. Security We rented a room safe, which was advertised at $3.0 US per day. We were expected to pay for the safe upon check out. When we went to settle-up the lobby staff wanted payment in Pesos and calculated the amount using the \u201chotels exchange rate\u201d; another attempt to rip off the guests. I stuck to my guns and only gave them US $. During check in we were told that a courtesy room would be available for us to use when we checked out a t 12:00 PM. This was because our transportation to the airport would not arrive until 5:30 PM. Therefore, they told us we could use the pool or beach and then have a shower and change of clothes before leaving. When we asked for the room at checkout, we were told that they had no rooms available. The Good The town of Playa Del Carmen is OK and makes a change from most of the Caribbean resort locations, which are often miles from anywhere. There are many small shops and restaurants along their Fifth Avenue. A 45 min boat trip from Playa del Carmen to Conzumel costs $12 US single and makes for an interesting day. Finally, we learned that it is not worth spending the extra 25 to 30% to go to Mexico for a vacation. From now on, our Caribbean vacations will be to Cuba or the DR.", "Date": "January 15, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Saskatoon, Canada", "Title": "\u201cI loved it so much!

The entertainments activities are goods but nothing extraordinary. The food is very good for breakfast at Adelita restaurant. They make excellent natural juices .We also ate in the evening at this restaurant but it was just average; not a really choice of healthy foods. Maria Bonita is another restaurant, supposedly \u201c a la carte\u201d but the food taste and looks very much alike with the food in Adelita restaurant. We ordered the \u201cviande grille\u201d which was very good but the rest, not at all. The desert was crepes but it was cold and hard, probably leftovers from the breakfast. The drinks are not good, not goods cocktails and not good coffee. The natural drinks are made with milk and a small piece of fruits: melon, banana, or a mix. Although you stay at Lupita, you also have access to eat and to the beach at Riu Yucatan, Tequila and Playacar. However you can borrow towels only from Lupita which is an inconvenient because you have to walk around all day carrying these towels. You have to return it to Lupita by 18:30. To go to the beach you have to use the bus provided by Lupita, another inconvenient because if you miss a bus you have to wait another 30 min for the next. The last bus was around 18:30 from the beach to Lupita so if you miss it you have to take a taxi. We did not find one at 5$ as people say, it was 15$. The rooms are very basic, nothing special and need updating. There is minibar in the room but it was filled up at two days or more. The sheets are not changed, they only do the beds. To have a safe in the room you have to pay 3$ per day. We ask for a safe at the very first day and the person at the front desk said that we have to pay before so we paid but did not ask for a receipt as the person at the front desk said we are all set. But when we check-out the person at the front desk said we have to pay the safe and we explained that we already did. She said that their computer show that we did not pay and that we must pay. We ask to speak with the director and we explained to him the situation and the fact that we are asked to pay again something that we already paid. He asked us to show a receipt proving that we paid and we explained that we did not received any. He said that he trusted his people and that we have to pay. We insisted explaining that this is a matter of principle and not of money. I asked him that he thinks that we are so cheap to bargain and argue for 20 $ and believe or not he said \u201cYes, I believe so\u201d. This was so insulting to be accused by the manager of the resort ob being liars and capable of this cheap fraud as trying to avoid to pay 20$!!!!

The bar staff do their job well and will make your drink stronger if you ask. The staff on the reception in the main are very helpful, and we found an answer to our questions quickly Just one point - It was our wedding anniversary during our stay and I had mentioned this on our reservation and by mail to the hotel , back in August for a stay in November,asking for a particular room. and also saying that it was our 3rd stay. We didn't get the room requested nor any gift or special drink but I preferred to let it go The room is due for a refurbish surely but it was clean (amazing hard working maid) everything worked and quiet so that was fine for us. The bed was firm but not rock solid and we slept really well. Only minor complaint is the air conditioning as it's really loud but as the weather got cooler we would cool the room in the daytime and turn it off at night The food was as good as before but there was a lot less choice on the buffets. Maybe this was due to it been off season ? We ate twice at the Mexican restaurant and this made a nice change from the main one. We used the small pool as we like the peace and quiet and when we wanted a bit more animation we took the bus and went to the Riu Playacar for their larger pool and of course the beach The beach is more amazing than ever due to the make over and we spent a lot of our time there this year. We took the bus that runs every 30 minutes to the beach and to Playa de Carmen it's self and had no bother with that., When it dropped us off at the Lupita beach club we just carried on to the Playacar To sum up if you want a calmer, friendly more family type of resort the Lupita is for you.

Stayed here from 26th October to 7th November and it was great!! Now, don\u2019t get me wrong, every one of us has a different expectation of a 5 star hotel, and I think it needs to be said that my first impression was a bit disappointing to be honest, but stay with me here ok?.... The grounds, golf course and reception area on arrival give a bit of a false impression of the grandeur that you are not going to get when it comes to the accommodation.... BUT.... the food, the staff and surrounding gardens/jungle, pools etc. make up for what can only be described as 3 star bedrooms. Due to its location out of town there is loads of wildlife that visits the hotel and the surrounding gardens, birds, large ground squirrells and a family of cotes that are (I think) a tropical version of a raccoon). I\u2019m afraid the chamber maids spend too much time making cuddly animals out of towels that look very pretty on the bed, so the bathrooms could have been cleaner, but that is my only complaint. Our room was large with 2 double beds, light and airy, good aircon, and in a very very quiet location (exactly what I asked for). Have not slept so well in years. Linen and towels (spotless) were changed regularly, floor mopped every day, toiletries replaced, and mini bar with 3 large bottles of water every 2 days and some beers and soft drinks too all included in the all inclusive. Happy days. So, fabulous value for money (750 pounds each for 12 nights all incl.), very good food, fantastic staff and 5 star service. What more could you ask for? The hotel directors are on hand the entire time too, and are very approachable, they'll even join you for a drink at the bar in the evening. Nice touch. A friendly and very relaxed feel to the place, nice pool areas, 1 lively and active run by a terrific entertainment team (if that\u2019s your thing) and the 2nd pool quiet and secluded with nothing going on around it (my sort of thing). Food!!! Well, if you were a hobbit you would be in your element. There\u2019s breakfast until 10am, snacks after that until 13.00, lunch until 15.00, snacks after that until 19.00, dinner until 22.00 and then?? Yup, snacks after that until at least midnight (although I never made it until after that time.. zzzzzz). If you are a night owl, the entertainment team will even take you out with them \u201con the town\u201d after they officially finish work. They are a real credit to the hotel. A special mention has to go to the staff at the pool bar in the evenings, they make a zillion different cocktails all fresh to order, not really any pre made mixes that I saw, and the mojitos are the best I ever tasted. Ask for an Irish coffee!!! And see what you get (see the photo). The chef in the dining room actually brought me a huge slice of cheesecake one evening at dinner when I mentioned that it was my favourite and not on the menu that night. Bless. There is an excellent (free!!) courtesy bus to the main resort of Playa 10 mins away from 07.30 in the morning until early evening that does 2 drop offs. 1st to down town Playa and 2nd to the hotels very own private beach which is just lovely. Nice little snack/drinks bar there too. You can also eat lunch (if you don\u2019t want to eat at the beach club that is) at any of the other Riu hotels locally if you are down at the beach during the day. You cannot eat at the Riu Palace though, which was a shame. Travelled with husband. Went scuba diving at \u201cScuba Playa\u201d they were fabulous. Did 2 dives locally, 2 in Cozumel (easy to get the ferry on your own etc. and Scuba Playa have a partner on Cozumel who looked after us when we got there for the day), and 2 in the Cenotes (cavern diving...OMG!!). Scuba Playa limits 4 guests to every instructor on every dive which was impressive, and they only employ instructors!! Our cenote guide Alex is actually a course director and cavern/cave diver instructor, we had a brilliant day with her and my husband went again but I went horse riding locally instead. Booked horse riding through an agent at reception and was told it would be 2 to 2 and half hour excursion and it was only an hour (60 bucks... ouch!!), so if you are going to do something with a company that is not your tour operator get it all in writing. I live and learn and am still fighting for a part refund. Travelled with Thomson from London Gatwick and it was smooth and efficient, our local rep Emma was great as she has lived in the area many years so is very knowledgeable, friendly and easy to get along with.

So instead of walking down the pathway to the Lupita Beach Club, we turned right when we got off the bus and walked about half a mile to the Yucatan Beach Club. The Yucatan Beach Club is really a gem. It has two very large pools overlooking the ocean, a large restaurant, and probably 5 bars offering named brand drinks. This is the place to be. I found it interesting that our wrist bands gave us access to the other Riu properties, but the shuttle did not go past those properties. Way to limit access. It didn't work for us. We made that walk to the Yucatan every day. From that point you need to walk about quarter mile to the beach. To sum it up, every day you wanted to go to that Yucatan beach club, you waited maybe 10 minutes for the shuttle, rode the shuttle for 15 minutes to the Lupita beach club, walked 10 minutes to the Yucatan, and another 5 down to the beach. That's about 40 minutes worth of travel just to get the beach when you are supposedly staying at a beach resort. Now you're basically committed to staying at the beach until you're ready to go back to the Lupita. As you can gather, there's not a lot of going back and forth between the Lupita and the beach. Last year when we stayed at the Tequila across the street from the Yucatan, we probably went back to the room nearly every day for some relief in the air conditioning. We under-estimated the value of this option. Leaving the beach and returning to the Lupita was usually painless. Just walk out of the Yucatan and there are any number of cabs going by and always some cabs parked at the Tequila that will take you the Lupita for $4. It's a little more than a mile from the Yucatan to the Lupita, but you have to walk clockwise on the circle road Xaman-Ha. If you go the way the shuttle goes, it will take you forever. On the plus side, the Lupita food is identical to the other Riu's. If you like real Mexican food, you will love it. I mean LOVE it. The buffet restaurant had Mexican food every night along side a specialty menu of the night (Caribbean, Italian, etc). There's an incredible abundance of fresh fruit and vegetables, so if you need to atone for Margarita's, you could! I noticed there were more Mexicans staying at the Lupita than the others. To that effect, some of the entertainment was enjoyably authentic. Mariachi troupes and Latin dance music some nights. I will say this was the only Riu where I saw people drinking shots of tequila! The rooms were fairly spartan and the beds were really hard, but the entire complex is cleaned meticulously. You definitely cannot drink the tap water, but the minibar is stocked with large bottles of water. The minibar is re-stocked every other day and I found the beer was replenished more generously when I left a dollar in the fridge. We'll be back at the Riu this winter, but I think next time I will dole out the extra cash to stay at the Tequila.", "Date": "September 25, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Allentown, Pennsylvania", "Title": "\u201cA Special Place with a Great Staff\u201d", "Author": "Mosa_10", "ReviewID": "UR80100561", "Content": "We are middle-aged Americans and have gone to Riu Lupita twice. It was very relaxing. No, it's not a 5 star hotel. The other Rius in the Playa del Carmen area fit that bill better. We liked Riu Lupita because it has lots of palm trees (shade) and it's quiet, and it has more of a homey feel. The resort is a succession of 3-story buildings, with walk-up outside stairs. No, it's not on the beach, but it's convenient to take the bus provided, which runs often and takes only 5-10 minutes to get to the other Rius (where you can enjoy some guest privileges like their lunches), and also to the Lupita's own private beach area which we found to be very nice. But we found that being off the ocean was not really a detriment and some days we just liked being at Lupita. It has lots of activities and a fabulous entertainment staff. I enjoyed the morning stretching sessions with Maxim and Marie. My husband loved the volleyball and the ping-pong. They have pool aerobics, darts, rifle-shooting, bingo. Some days we would take the pleasant half-hour walk into the center of Playa del Carmen for shopping. The Lupita food was very good - lots of variety, and fresh fruit and veggie-oriented dishes. They also have a more formal restaurant but we found the main buffet area to suit our needs. The service staff was absolutely lovely at the bar and the restaurant. And at night it was great to be outside under the thatched-roof, open air restaurant enjoying the jmusic trio playing soft Santana-type music. They also had tennis courts. The pool was very nice. The entertainment at night was a mixed bag, some very silly stuff that made you laugh, and some imported shows, some good, some so-so. The room itself was simple but we found it fine. The bed was hard, but I like it that way. We had a room with a small balcony that looked out into a jungle and we really enjoyed watching the wildlife (cotes ?) that nested in the trees and swung from branch to branch. The only thing we would have liked better about Lupita was that there were so few Americans. My guess is that it's 70% French/Belgian/German/Spanish, 17% Brit, 8% Canadian, and 3% US. So we found it more difficult to socialize. But then again, it was nice being in a completely different and more sedate culture.

With the exception of the pallaces, we enjoyed access to the Yucatan, Tiqullia, and the playacar for the beaches, drinks, breakfast and lunch, and entertainment. While the resort is not on the beach, there is a very convienent shuttle that will take you to a private beach belonging to the hotel which has pleanty of sun and shade to enjoy (limited food and beverages tho) The shuttle also stops at the main shopping area in playa del carmen. if you are looking for a bit more excitment (and name-brand liquor) the beach at the RIU Playacar is a short walk (we spent most all of our beach time there). The food is very good (with a fabulous spread for xmas dinner) in the buffet and the a la cartes were quite nice too. Rooms were a bit spartan, but not what we go to the tropics for so they were more than comfortable with good A/C. AWESOME STAFF!!!

Firstly, we were aware of the location of the hotel prior to booking it, the shuttle bus provided lived upto our expectations as reliable and convenient (on the hour and 30 mins past the hour) to take us firstly to '5TH Avenue' and then onto our own private beach bar (which exceeded my personal expectations with great food from 12-3pm and copius cold drinks and sun beds on our own private beach!)! It's location is perfect if you are able/willing to walk for 20 mins into 'Playa Carmen' after a big meal, as we did once or twice, but otherwise a taxi is only $5US after the shuttle bus has finished for the day (1830hrs). The staff upon arrival were the same as every other Riu Hotel we have visited..friendly, multi-lingual and helpful. The hotel itself has a bit of a confusing lay-out, but the simple first walk to your room gets you familiar with that. Our room (second floor, away from the pools/bar/restaurant) was spacoius enough for 2, very clean and very modest. Providing there is not a group of noisy occupants staying above you, then you will have a good nights' sleep...the tiled floors offer no cushion against high heels, dragged suitcases, or the cleaning staff in the morning! One thing i will mention though, in compasion to the Riu Tequila, is that it wouldn't surprise me if this hotel undergoes some sort of referbishment within the next couple of years.The food on offer was very, very nice. A wide range of buffet meals, snacks and drinks were served with a smile every single day (special thanks to 'Maximo' our waiter- a genuinly nice man!). The main restaurant plays host to breakfast, lunch and evening meals and the work in which the staff put into it to turn it around for each meal time was very impressive! Special 'themed' food nights were set in tune with that particular nights' entertainment, which again, was very enjoyable. The main bar at the main pool was staffed with very helpful, and clever, barmen..with every drink you could imagine. Of the Riu Lupitas' 3 pools, we found the 'Quiet' one the best....set back away from the main pool, it offered shade, peace and quiet. The Entertainment was also very good, keeping in mind that this is the smallest and indeed the quietest of all the half dozen or so 'Riu's on the Playacar development...each night (on a 7 night rota) provided different levels of entertainment for all the family. There really wasn't much that let this hotel down, bearing in mind that we stayed at the Riu Tequila a few years earlier and were trying our best NOT to compare the two, but every hotel has it's downpoints. Our bathroom needed a lick of paint... there really wasn't many English/British staying there, although we are not rude in any way, it would have been nice to hear a familiar accent once in a while, there was a chance at one point when i was becoming fluent in French and Spanish! Also, in the un/likely event of a torrential downpour (we seen them many, many times in our 2 week stay) then i feel that certain parts of the hotel can become slippery and a little dangerous, so be very careful as to your steps around the complex. All in all, it was a thoroughly decent hotel.

Fantastic value for money $100 per night for 2 persons all inclusive (Travel Republic) Location in Playacar. Use of the sister Hotels, Playacar, Yucatan, Tequila. Quiet location. The Hotel is located within the private Playacar area, adjacent to the Golf Course, the Hotel and grounds are very clean/tidy, compact with all facilities within easy walking distance. Service was first class at Reception, Restaurant, and Bar, checking in we were welcomed with a cocktail and checking out was very easy. One main restaurant which we found the food to be very good, better all round presentation/quality than the Grand Xcaret (GX), and the Restaurant had much more atmosphere about it than the main Restaurant at GX, also the wine was drinkable ! There was a secondary Mexican Restaurant but we did not try this, mainly due to the choices available at the Main Restaurant. The Hotel only has the one main bar, which is located next to the main pool, this tends to be the central social meeting point at the Hotel, drinks were well prepared and not watered down. There is a disco which opens between 11pm-2pm, but not a lot of activity inside when we looked in one night at approx 11.30pm, not that sort of Hotel. There is also a secondary smaller quiet pool which we used a number of times. Both pools were kept clean and never a problem what ever time you wanted 2 beds/shade in the week we were at the Hotel. Always day entertainment/activities going on and a show every night at 9.30pm ish. The Hotel runs a free Coach between 8.30am - 6.45pm every 30 mins which takes approx 10 mins and has 2 drop offs, one at the edge of Downtown Playa (5 mins walk to 5th Av), and the second at the entrance to the private Lupita Beach Club. You can help yourself to Beer, Wine, Soft Drinks and snacks at the Beach Club with beds/shade without charge. If you walk a further 5 mins down the road, opposite a small shopping area (with a Starbucks) is the RIU Playacar which backs onto the beach, and a further 5 mins walk brings you to the Tequila and opposite beachside Yucatan. All of these three sister Hotels are high quality, and the great thing is that you can mix/match eating breakfast/lunch at these Hotels and visiting at night to watch the entertainment/shows using the bars without any additional cost. We saw some great big production shows, especially at the Tequila which is a RIU Club Hotel, it also has a large 24 hr Sports Bar with approx 12 screens showing sport from around the world (which makes the Sport Bar at GX look very poor) and a nightclub/disco. The restaurants/bars were great at all RIU Hotels, with grand reception areas and grounds, great pools. Lots of buzz going on at these 3 Hotels which was good but the Lupita sometimes proved to be a quiet retreat when you needed it. A taxi either into Playa or any of the sister Hotels amounted to 50 pesos from the Lupita. If you check out the present Hotel standings in PDC Area, it is no coincidence in my opinion that the Tequila is rated 22, Playacar 44, Yucatan 50, Lupita 51 and the Grand Xcaret 59. If you check out the rates the Lupita which is the smallest of the RIU Hotels has the lowest rates of the four Hotels, but we loved staying at the Lupita and using the bigger Hotels when it suited us. Our room at the Lupita was smaller than that of the GX, but was clean and very functional, mini bar topped up each day, also in the RIU rooms you have a bottle of Rum, Tequila, Vodka, Whisky/Brandy that you can help yourself to !!!

The rooms were cleaned everyday and the fridge restocked every other day. Went for a relaxing all inclusive holiday with 3 boys aged 12, 10 and 8. The boys spent the first few days entertaining themselves round the pool and my husband joined in all the activities run by the entertainment team so I was left to soak up some sun and enjoy the cocktails. The kids club kept the boys entertained with many games and activities, not a dvd in sight! The club ran from 10 - 1 and the 3 - 5pm, with somedays joining in with the French kids club and a couple of days the staff took them in for lunch from 1 - 2pm as a treat. The hotel has approx 300 rooms so the complex is very small which was ideal as the boys were never too far away when they were playing with the other children. Easy to nip back to your room as well when you wanted something. The food was plentiful and the staff throughout the hotel were very polite and friendly.

The beach club for the Lupita is lovely, very tropical looking and the drinks and snacks down there are all included too. Don't take any towels with you as you won't need any spares, towels are provided in your room (normally in animal shapes!) and pool towels are allowed to be taken to the beach. Night entertainment starts off with the kids doing their bit - sometimes a show or dance they have created in the kids club. Then there are the certificates for the daily competition winners (bingo bingo couchee couchee etc) followed by some embarressing games for the unlucky volunteers and then usually a dance show or a band. We were there an extra 4 days due to the volcano in Iceland and the staff at the hotel were very understanding and supportive ringing our rep when we asked them to and making sure we were still enjoying ourselves. Very attentive. The hotel was then filled to capacity as some guests were moved to the Lupita awaiting transfer to Cancun airport.

Thomson didnt tell the hotel, but a friend of mine did and they made my birthday fantastic. We got back to the room and they had made a massive birthday cake out of towels and blankets and left us fruit and champagne. I had a great birthday, but shared with my partner who had missed out because of the tour operater. The rooms were basic, but very well kept and cleaned everyday. We left a tip every day for the cleaners and always came back to the room with more lovely creatures made out of towels. There was even a crocodile with something in its mouth to teddy bears and dogs. they were amazing. Fridge was stocked every 2 days, but if we had drinks left, we would hide them and would be filled up and we'd have extra. There are lots of \"coties\" they look a little like raccoons but are very cute and friendly. We were on the ground floor and they came up to you and ate out of your hand. They love crisps lol But once you feed 1 loads come :) Pool was not massive, but big enough and wasnt always crowded, but is also a small quiet pool not far away on site. There is a spa but is quite expensive but are lots of places on 5th Avenue that are a lot cheaper. The entertainment was good for the 1st week, but was the same the 2nd week which was a little disappointing, but they went out of their way to make you happy. Its all inclusive and even had cocktails you could have. If they dont have the cocktail on the menu they would be happy to make it for you. I recommend a Margarita De Fresa mmmmm!!!!! We went to Xcaret (Pronounced Ishcaret) and Xel-Ha (Pronounced Shell Ha) they are both amazing places. Xcaret was great as we swam with dolphins. We'd recommend payin for the hour as you you do lots more and does seem to go so quickly. we stayed for the show at night and was so spectacular. It shows you how mexico be came Spanish speaking and the games they used to play. We were lucky as i have a friend who lives in Mexico and met up with us and explained it as it was happening. But is still worth watching. Def get the full tickets for that :) The snorkling at Xel-ha was so amazing. Highly recommend it. We also went to tulum, It is a beautful place with ruins, but pay for a guide to explain what the ruins were all about, but there is a fantastic beach you can go to. Its so beautiful, its the best beach we had ever seen. Very small, but lovely. The water sparkled and the sand was so white and fine. We loved it. Just what you needed after looking around the ruins, being hot and getting in nice sea. It was like getting into a warm bath. We didnt want to leave :( 5th Avenue is the place to go to get your trips. you will save lots of money as the reps make money on top of them so dont buy from them. Only thing about 5th Avenue is, you need to learn \"no gracias\" very quickly as they all shout you to go in to there shops. Make sure you barter lots or you may pay over the top for things. be careful you know how much your spending or you'll get ripped off. If you eat out, you have to tip 10% of your bill if you liked the service or 20% if it was fantastic. But they dont add the service charge so you have to be careful. We'd recommend taking a mixture of currency as we took mostly Paso's but found sometimes it was better paying in USD. If you pay in USD, they will give you change in Pasos. So choice is yours really. We went on the bus that runs every 30mins to the RIU Palace, to the beach. Its well worth using. Only thing is it stops about 7pm and need to use a taxi. But isnt expensive. They do have WiFi, but only in the lobby of the hotel. But do have an internet cafe. Not sure how much as we used the free WiFi. But was very grateful for that as was very much needed to contact UK. Overall, we would most definatly go again. It was a fantastic holday and hated coming home. People of Mexico are so friendly and very polite.

The hotel beach club was situated next to the Riu Palace food and drink were available all day, the views were stunning and the beaches (perfect). this is the perfect holiday for relaxing and outdoor persuits. with water sports off all sorts available we decided snorling was one we couldn't miss, we tried to stay away from the over comercialised and tour opererated trips, and seeked out authorised, but a more eco friendly and locally operated trips, if you shop around there are plenty off these available. we would like to recomend *Allternative off the beaten track adventures*..these guys are fantastic at providing the most amazing adventures.we did the Jungle trek and snorkling in the most amazing cenote.(child Friendly) but also for the more extremists too. do not hesitate to go off the resort, it is far from being dangerous...we hired bikes and cycled all over and we felt safe as houses. the people off mexico are so friendly. Chichen Itza is fantastic...a little touristy for our liking, but worth it. you needs lots off tip money for this trip. as there are several stop offs, tipping in mexico is a sign off curtacy, what you would expect dick turpin to do in the UK......... lol. A must is to jump on the ferry to Cozumel. there is lots to do its about 14 peso eack way (worth every penny) you can hire bikes cars mopeds or just potter along the coast, we went snorklingon some off the best reefs in the worls discovered by jack custo, enjoyed the delights of Mcdonalds, then headed back to our all inclusive beach resort for some well earned chill out time. over all our time in Mexico was out off this world, we spent a week here, if work comitments were not an issue we would have spent a month. can't wait to go back, there is a huge amount we still want to see and do, so for now anyone that visits mexico....live, love and cherrish your stay.", "Date": "April 5, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Ottawa Ontario Canada", "Title": "\u201cClean and quiet, great food with wonderful staff...\u201d", "Author": "LeisureGirl10", "ReviewID": "UR59727939", "Content": "We just returned from the Riu Lupita with our 2 teenage daughters 18 and 15. We stayed in the 28th block and liked this location. The room was comfotable. It had a little patio and was always clean thanks to our pleasant maid \"Melita\" and the fridge well stocked with soda, beer and water- if you run out of water, just see the front desk. The desk staff were very pleasant and answered any of our questions. Do not drink from the taps or brush your teeth!- use the bottled water. The staff work so hard to keep the rooms clean and the grounds well maintained, so tip them a few dollars- they are so appreciative! There is free wireless in the lobby area. LOCATION- it is on the golf course, which is a bit pricey to play 180.00US. It's just minutes from Playa Del Carmen and the beach. The hotel shuttle runs every 1/2 hour, with the first stop a short walk to 5th avenue (shopping), the 2nd stop is at Lupita Beach where you can access all the resorts (except the Palace). We rode the shuttle everyday and really enjoyed the 5-10 min ride through a bit of Playa-car. The last shuttle is at 7pm from the beach, but a taxi is only about 5.00US. There are 3 resorts to enjoy- 2 on the beach (Riu Playacar and Riu-Yukatan) and 1 (Riu-Tequilla)just on the other side of the street. The street in front of Tequilla has a neat plaza with lots of local vendors. We purchased our tickets to Xel-ha at a KIOSK there. Keep in mind that they may try to push time shares but if you have 90 mins to go to a time share presentation it can save you a lot of cash. We decided to do it because it was raining and bartered with the guy for a great deal (paid 50.00 Us for our entire family of 4 when the regular ticket price is 119.00 with transportation!) We learned later that the rep at the kiosk makes 500.00US for sending us to this presentation so barter with him big time- well worth the savings and the Real club visit was quite equisite- there wasn't much pressure because we were firm with our NO's. XEL-HA was a really cool natural area to snorkel! FOOD: You can eat at Lupita beach buffet (breakfast/lunch)- no coctails here, just beer/wine or visit the other 3 resorts for breakfast/lunch buffet and all the cocktails you want! Fave- Mohito!!!!!The food is really good at all the resorts, with much variety and not one of us got sick. I especially loved the omlets, fruit and the fresh salsa and guacamole. You are not entitled to dinner at the other resorts. You can have dinner at the LUPITA buffet or make a reservation in the morning to book the restaurant on site- (2 seatings @ 7 and 9pm) \"order the chicken, it was great and all the guests were raving about it!\" The cappucinos are really good at all the resorts. Playacar has a nice pool and is a little less busy than Yukatan. We loved Yukatan because of the view from the pool overlooking the ocean. It has a few swim up bars and lots of activity- the entertainment staff by the pool are very friendly and do their best to get the guests involved in activities (volleyball, target shooting, dance lessons, spanish lessons...)but if you want to just laze, you can do that too- they aren't pushy. We only saw one night show at the Lupita and it was a little lame, but the staff go over-the-top to entertain you! They had shows like \"Grease\" and Abba at the Yukatan, but we were too tired by the end of the day (shows at 9:30pm) and didn't see them. We also heard that Tequila (on the opposite side of the street) has a great disco and the teenagers love it- we didn't get there. The local transporation \"collectivo vans\" located on Calle 2 North between 15 and 20th ave, just a few minutes walk from 5th ave. We rode the collectivo for 2 dollarsUS to visit Akumal beach. The vans are very clean and we felt very safe with our 2 teenage daughters. We had lunch at Lol-Ha on the beach and snorkeled with sea turtles-- it was absolutely amazing! There are some neat artisan shops here too at Akamal beach. Next time we'll take the collectivo to the ruins in Tulum- we ran out of time this trip. In summary: the trip was well worth it and staying off the beach at the Riu-Lupita was nice if you like a little quiet at the end of your busy day.

Although Riu claims that the Lupita Hotel is a 5 star, the rooms, grounds, dining room, bar, lobby, food, entertainment and swimming pools are more like a 3 star hotel. 2. For about $200 more a week you can stay at the other Riu Playacar, Tequila or Yucatan that are closer to a 4 star. The following is the review as a 3 star hotel: \u2022 The food was good with a nice variety but repetitive as any other buffet. \u2022 The drinks were watered down at the bar. \u2022 The location of the hotel in reference to the beach was 20 minutes by bus and walking. \u2022 The rooms were of average size, with less than average furniture and bathroom features. \u2022 The drinks supplied in the room were good and replenished as needed. \u2022 The hotels workers are to be praised for their excellent work at the hotel. \u2022 The coffee from the espresso machines was poor. The machines should be adjusted to get the best flavor for the coffee used. \u2022 The room key is actually a key with a huge tag that has the room number on it. Attached to the room key is also the safety deposit box key. This combination of tag and keys are very annoying to carry. It would nice if the key could be changed to a regular keycard and have electronic safety boxes. This way it would eliminate the possibility of theft in the room in the case of losing the key. \u2022 Just outside the hotel is a sewage treatment plant that has very undesirable odor. \u2022 Last but not least is that out of the two weeks at this hotel there seemed to be an improvement in the food, wine and attractions during the second week of our stay. Later it was said that the second week was high season and as such the price paid at the hotel was more expensive. \u2022 David, the entertainment manager does not seem to have a handle to provide good entertainment. There seemed to be a show only every other night and in one night the show was children from the school of dance. Not very appropriate for a night adult show.

We'd read a couple of reviews about cockroaches in rooms etc and were a bit worried before leaving, but we found the rooms spotless with no bugs other than a few little ants. We had a number of downpours and still no nasty creatures came to visit. We were in room 3022. Rooms Our room was a good size, overlooking the adult pool, cleaned every day and sheets changed a couple of times per week. Bathroom with bath, shower and hairdryer all spotless. Minibar and optics restocked every 2 days (we'd not used everything a couple of times so emptied the fridge before it got restocket and ended up with extra for the next 2 days :)). Restaurant Half inside half outside with no set seating which is nice. Buffet foor with fresh pasta, meat and fish. Fresh egg chef at breakfast didnt speak english and got very ratty with us when we asked for fresh omlettes without meat in, her customer service was terrible!! Food got a bit repetitive as we're veggies but didn;t go hungry between the buffet meals and snackbars that open when the main restaurant closes there's always something to eat! There are also drinks on tap which saves bothering the waiters or having to wait for a drink, Didn;t have any illness or see any illness, only thing we did notice was a few odd mexican dishes from the night before getting served up for breakfast, yuck!! Didn;t eat at the al a carte so can;t comment on that. Facilities Pools, bar etc well kept, quick and friendly service at the bar, amazing cocktail menu :) All inclusive truly is all inclusive unlike other hotels we've visited, we also found out there was baileys which isn;t on the menu :). Reception staff friendly and helpful, bus to beach very puctual and handy for playadelcarmen too. Other RIUs We tried out all the other hotels apart from yucutan. The food at Playacar was definately best, many more options at lunch time, plus you can walk in from the beach so no bus needed. Theres also wine, beer, sodas on tap and nachos/popcorn with paper bowls to take to the beach here which was nice. Beach The beach was a bit of a road while we were there, which we;ll be taking up with thomsons, but will be much better when its finished (it;s being extended by dredging sand from out at sea). No snorkelling from the beach as its too rough to see anythng exciting. Trips We went to Chitchen itza ($45) Tulum and Coba ($50) snorkelling in cozumel ($30 + ferry 280peso) and Sian Khan ($85). All trips we did through Eric who was in the 'office' oposite the lupita beach bus stop. we paid almost half what thomson wanted us to pay (we haddled a bit) but wouldnt have gone with the thomson rep anyway as she was terrible! We went on trips as we wanted a guide with us but if you don;t mind have a look in the bus station first as the buses go everywhere and are really reasonable. If you want to go to xe xah or xcaret you get free transport from the bus station when you buy a ticket there. Playa Del Carmen There's a couple of little ruins on the outskirts, but other than that its just a little town with a few bars and restaurants. What we liked was how safe everywhere felt and that you didnt get too much hassle. You can change money in Playa, where its (currently) 19.5 peso to the pound, which was better than travel agents rates, the usa dollar is accepted everywhere tho. Cancun We visited on the bus and got a taxi to the tourist area as didn;t know there was another bus available to there, the taxi was 120pesos, we got the bus back, the R1 takes you from outside cancun station to the downtown hotel zone. The main strip (next to the crocodile lake) as all the big american restaurant and shop chains and cocobongo etc. So in short, hotel is great for price, wouldnt say its 5 star, but then its nto 5 star price!

My husband had seafood on a regular basis and never once had a problem. The entertainment team do their best and try hard but the shows are mainly dancing and can get repetitive as can the food, which is always decorated up with sculptures of ice, melon or butter or sometimes all 3. The bar staff had even replensihed your drink before your glass was empty. We had a problem with the beaches, but that was the fault of the Government - only our beach was open and it is only a small one but was trying to cater for the larger hotels also - very difficult. We went on a couple of trips but booked these on 5th Avenue (2nd one as you enter) and found no problem - we had a very knowledgeable guide who spoke good english and were in a group of english and canadians. HOwever other people we spoke to at the hotel had booked in town with other agencies and did not have the same advantages, so do check and double check as otherwise you will not get the full information on the ruins. You can do Tulum ruins on your own - catch a bus from Playa del Carmen bus station, to anywhere and it's fairly cheap - about \u00a31 as is Cancun.

The maid came and cleaned our room everyday and made little fancy animal figures out of towels however the sheets on our beds were not changed once the entire week. The bed was made up and nothing more. I know the sheets were not changed because we all became sick and were vomiting and I apologize for this but the aroma was still fresh once you pulled the bedding down. There is nothing worse than throwing up for \u00bd day, start feeling better and take a shower and get into a dirty bed. Our first breakfast my son went into the buffet and grabbed a plate and went YUCK....I asked him why he made that comment and he turned his plate around and at the bottom it was covered in what appeared to be mashed potatoes which were obviously from the dinner the night before. Of course that totally grossed me out and couldn't eat anything after that. Service at this hotel was almost non- existent\u2026..my husband and I drink tea in the mornings with our breakfast and only twice out of 7 day stay were we asked by a waiter if we wanted something. We couldn\u2019t believe that we managed to eat all of our breakfast and talk about all the activities we wanted to take advantage of and not one waiter offered their assistance. As frequent RIU travellers we didn\u2019t have any unrealistic expectations and that service at other hotels we stayed at were always exceptional and prompt. This hotel was very disappointing. The hotel is advertised as a 4* but when you arrive on your bus it shows as a 5*. There is no way this hotel is a 4* I would grade it as 2.5 or a 3 at best. The food was just ok and then combining that with no service just doesn\u2019t make for a good stay nor does it meet that acceptable 4* family resort. The selection of food was not very good and rarely changed from day to day. They had Mexican night on Wednesday which my husband and kids said were amazing but I didn\u2019t take advantage of this as I had been throwing up for \u00bd day. Everyone in my family with the exception of my husband became ill and vomiting and I\u2019m sure it\u2019s due to their lack of hygiene. With the awareness of H1N1 globally I was shocked to see no hand sanitizers in the hotel or bedroom. Because we were all sick over the course of 5 days we didn\u2019t take advantage of any excursions and that was sad because Mexico has one of the largest coral reefs in the world and the snorkelling is amazing. All in all this trip was a complete disaster and I would never recommend family/friends or strangers to go there. The weather was terrible for 3 days out of our 7\u2026.it was very windy, cool and overcast. Of course that is not any fault of Mexico it\u2019s a risk anytime you go away whether it be early, middle or late in the year. In the evening you need a sweater because the temperature does drop so come prepared. Hats off to the entertainment crew especially Sergio for helping make our stay better. We played volleyball and other activities at the hotel and it was fun. For those of you who are thinking of booking this hotel please save yourself money and try somewhere else or better yet pay the extra $1,200 or so and go to the Tequila. For those who have booked this hotel bring plenty of hand sanitizer, immodium, raid and insect repellent because the bugs are bad. I really really hate to post this negative review and have never done so in the past but our experience needs to be shared so that any other family who is considering the Riu Lupita explore all their options including other hotels.

It is a small resort with a short bus ride (every 1/2 hour) to the beach and market on 5th street. The pool was well kept and there was a quiet (adult) pool by the disco for those that wanted peace and quiet. The entertainment was OK around the pool, could be a little better organized but all had fun. Food was plentiful and variety but very repetitave. The a la cart restaurant is very small with true authentic Mexican food. Not much variety and the same menu every night. If you or your children wish to try scuba diving, we highly recomend Mathius in the dive shop. He is very good with children and his instruction is very thorough. Sandy at the front desk was awsome. She went above and beyond to help us with serveral issues. One note - beware when you get off the plane for the 'Time Share Sharks'. You may think they are with your tourist agency and will lead to believe the same until they have secured a deal. They will honour what they say they will give you but much time is taken as a result. We highly recomend a visit to Xel Ha or Xcaret if you have a day. Be sure to buy your tickets in the market you will get a better deal than with your tourist company at the resort. When going to these parks make sure you have at least 300 pasoes for each person for a deposit for any equipment (snorkels, masks, towels, lockers) you will get it back when you return the equipment.

But we went and decided to make the most of it. Our concern was the fact that it is a 4 star resort as compared to the others in the area which are mostly 5 star. As it turns out I suspect it is rated as 4 star because it is smaller and doesn't have all the facilities that some of the others do. However, we felt very safe there as we had 2 older teenagers and 2 younger kids with us. We didn't have any problem letting them go back and forth from the pool to the room. The Lupita isn't beachfront, but does have it's own beach nearby which you get to by shuttle, or if you don't feel like waiting for the shuttle back, you can take a taxi back for $5 USD. One of the great things about it is you can use the facilties at 3 other, bigger Rius in the area. The shuttle takes you to the entrance to the beach club and you can then walk 5-15 minutes to any of the other ones. You aren't allowed into the 2 Riu Palaces which are along the same stretch of beach. I would say the food quality was very good, although as is the case with any of these places, you can get very tired of the same food day after day - there are some changes but basically the same things. Also, 3 out of the 6 of us got sick from the food. I don't think there was anything wrong with the food, just that it was different and we reacted to it. I was advised one time to start taking acidophilus 2 weeks before going south, but I didn't take the advice this time and regret it now. There are different bacteria in the food and some peoples' systems can't handle it. There is only one a la carte restaurant here - it is very small and it is mexican. It was never full and I know why. It really wasn't great food at all and you don't get much choice so you are better off to go for the buffet. You can ask to look at the menu beforehand - so if you don't like the look of it, you don't have to book a night there. We took a day trip to Xel-Ha which was an amazing experience and I would highly recommend it. The tour company through the hotel wanted $119 USD per person but I got it much cheaper through a person at a kiosk at the Playacar Shopping Centre - don't be afraid to ask for a better deal.

The rooms are not five star as in uk terms but they are clean and presentable.

You can use the other RUI hotels which are much larger loads of people and loads to do. I found the food to be good with a large selection from the buffet you could always find something you liked. The staff in the hotel are very good and very friendly and the entertaiment team in particular are a great bunch. If you get the chance go to coco bongos with the entertainment team they get you into the vip area called the diamond right in front of the stage which must be the best position in the place and it really is a good show. If you turn right at the entrance of the hotel you can walk across the golf course to the Lupita Beach club it is a private course and you may be met by security but they were always friendly and the walk only takes 5 min. If you use taxis i found it cheaper to pay in Mexican Pesos rather than Dollars. If you want to use the other RUI hotels walk up the road from the Lupita Beach Club rather than along the beach, it is easier to identify the hotels from the road and there is a hotel that jutts right up to the waters edge that you have to wade around sometimes the water was past my knees so not good for small kids. 5th avenue which is the main shopping area is nothing special just loads of shops selling tourist tat with some bars and jeweller shops. Chitzen Itza is a must see but it is at least a three hour drive away.

We found plenty of variety in the buffet, especially if you were prepared to try the Mexican dishes (which we were). This time we did not bother with the a la carte restaurant. I spoke to the Director of the hotel about the excellent service we received, and she told me they foster a feeling of home with the staff, and encourage them to treat guests as they would visitors to their own homes. The results are fabulous. There were a few of the staff we recognised from our last visit, and they are all very friendly. There is an effort made to involve back-room staff with visitors, and we had evening demonstrations of towel folding (making animal shapes from towels), and ice sculpting, which one of the chefs does.

We booked fairly last minute via Teletext Holidays. Our holiday was with Cosmos (now owned by Monarch), using Thomson flights. We paid \u00a3670 per person, and for that we got an excellent value for money 2 week holiday in the Playacar resort. Having said that, the Riu Lupita is a decent 3* hotel - certainly not 4* or 5* and whether it is good value depends on what deal you can get. The same holiday was being advertised with Thompson just after we booked ours for \u00a31200 per person, and if I had paid that I would not have been happy! The Lupita is located within the Playacar resort, which is a US style private 'estate' built aruond a golf course with security checkpoints at the access points. The Lupita is right next to the golf course so it is nice & quiet, but not on the beach. There is not much traffic & it feels really safe. The town of Playa del Carmen adjoins the estate - loads of shops, restaurants & the ferry port for going to Cozumel. The rooms at the Lupita are pretty basic, but ours had a nice high ceiling, two double beds & good air con. The housekeeping service was really good - everything was cleaned well, and they leave little towel animals for you. We had no issues with bugs really, but we got some spray in case the odd mozzy or large ant got in. The mini bar is restocked every other day. You get bottled beer, Pepsi, Diet Pepsi, 7up, large bottles of mineral water & cans of soda water. There are two pools - the large main one next to the bar, and a smaller round one that our room block backed on to. There were always plenty of loungers, but the hotel was clearly at nowhere near full capacity. During the day at the Lupita it is pretty quiet, especially if you stay by the smaller pool. At the main pool you get music from the bar, and sometimes they are rehearsing for the shows on the stage - this could be annoying as they would play the same track over & over! Food & drink: breakfast buffet was good - American streaky bacon, pancakes etc, omelette station, cereal, toaster, scrambled eggs, fresh fruit, juices etc. Lunch buffet was fine - I'd usually get some salad & rice or make my own sandwich as there was usually cold meat or cheese. Dinner buffet was a bit hit & miss - they had theme nights, but it was always a variation of the same stuff - some good, some awful. Not great overall. There is only one 'a la carte' at the Lupita and it is 'Mexican'. We ate there once (you book in the morning) and it was truly awful. You only get to choose your main course, so it's not really 'a la carte' and I don't think the menu changes much! Entertainment: We were weren't fussed about this, and didn't witness much of the evening stuff, shows etc. What I did see was pretty average, and you would need to have quite a lot of the inclusive booze to appreciate it :) But this isn't a factor in what we look for in a holiday, so it didn't matter particularly. One of the real selling points of the Lupita is that you can use the facilities (pools, beach, breakfast & lunch) at the Riu Yucatan, Riu Playacar & Riu Tequila, aswell as the Riu Lupita Beach Club (has loungers, beach area under trees, main beach section & lunch buffet/snack bar), which is located next to the Riu Palace Riviera Maya. We probably only spent 3-4 of our day time at the Lupita itself. The shuttle bus goes every 30 mins & stops at the town, then the Lupita Beach Club. All the other Riu's are nearby. To sum up the others.... Riu Yucatan - nicest pool area as it directly overlooks the beach. Also the nicest & biggest section of beach (in our opinion). However, it is quite noisy there during the day - frequent announcements over the microphone about water polo, crazy ping pong, water aerobics, rifle shooting etc and loud music (including a whole morning of Elvis). If you're down on the beach you can't really hear it though! Riu Tequila - not on the beach, but has the largest pool area & we spent some nice mornings here. Riu Playacar - some afternoons there was a bit too much 'animation', loud music here, but it also has a nice beach area, just not as big as that at the Yucatan. Overall, we really enjoyed ourselves because the weather was fantastic, the atmosphere at the Lupita was generally nice & chilled, and the beach was lovely & easily accessible.

The hotel is small so if you want lots of action then you're better off staying at the larger Riu's, you can use the Riu Tequila, Yucatan and Playacar however you have to eat dinner in your own hotel. We visited the other 3 and much preferred ours it was smaller, friendlier and everyone gets to know everyone else. There were a lot of French people during the second week (some who were exceptionally rude...) and not a lot of English. We made a lot of friends though with the English who were there, some Spanish, Mexican and Portugese who we have kept in touch with. The hotel is beautiful - we were given a cocktail on arrival and our bags were taken to our rooms. At the airport be careful of people taking advantage one couple were told their bus had gone and that they should get in a taxi and would be given a receipt that they should give to their Rep to claim the money back (1,250 peso) however this was a scam and the bus had not left the airport so beware!! The rooms are big - ours had 2 double beds in, a balcony, full air con and a ceiling fan, free safety deposit box and a hair dryer. They were cleaned every day and a towel animal was left on our bed everyday. We also took part in one of the shows and were left with a fruit basket and extra large towel display! We had no visible bugs or insects in our rooms - but we got bitten quite a lot! The food is fantastic, my boyfriend did a tour of the kitchens and said they were perfectly clean and hygenic. We never visited the a la carte as people had said it wasn't as nice as the buffet. There was plenty of choice (with a smoking and non smoking section) and we always found something we wanted to eat. They have theme nights also which is nice. The waiters are extremely helpful and seat you and get your drinks. There is a snack bar open at times when the main buffet is closed. We only went to the beach three times but it is stunning. The shuttle bus leaves every half an hour on the dot and takes about 6 minutes to get to the beach, where there's a part sectioned off with sun beds and palm trees for the Riu Lupita. There is also a snack bar. All non-motorised sports are free and can be done here and there is a spa back at the hotel which do amazing massages, we had a swedish massage which lasted 50 mins for only $30!! The bus also drops you off at 5th avenue a shopping street. Make sure you haggle and shop around and shop prices seemed to differ dramatically. Also I would avoid going in pairs - there are a few dodgy characters down there that our Rep failed to mention, including people attempting to put drugs in your pocket or bag and then make you pay for it. We only went here twice, it's not too bad if you know to keep an eye out. The entertainment staff are fantastic - Alex, Tdeao and Sergio made us feel welcome and always came and spoke to us and remembered names. They do so many activities during the day and have so much energy, they made our holiday. Take part in the activities they're actually fun and we made a lot of friends this way even if there was a language barrier!! There is also a night club which opens 11pm-2am every day on sight - it's not the best but Elio the DJ is lovely and we became good friends with him. It's free to go in and the drinks are all part of your all inclusive package. Our room backed onto the club and we could not hear any music or people at night when we didn't go to the club. We did three day trips whilst we were there. Fat Cat which is a catamaran, fantastic but I was really sea sick (which I never normally get) but the places they take you are lovely. Chichen Itza was amazing, it's a 3.5 hour drive from the hotel so sleep on the coach. The tour guide we had was really good and the facts that they give you are unbelievable. There are a lot of poor people here trying to sell things though (always shouting \"$1 almost free\") but check the quality of the wood and the ornaments are sometimes made out of cement. We really enjoyed this trip, it was $99 for the day including lunch but the heat is unbelievable, it hit nearly 40 degrees when we were there and we found it too hot to be walking around too much in the free time they give you so we only saw the main parts. Xel-Ha was our last one and my favourite. $119 for the day and only about 40 mins drive. It's an eco-park and you do snorkeling and can ride on a blow up rubber ring down a lazy river. It was my best day out but you have to buy special suncream that has no chemicals as the fish will die (again the rep never told us this). You also leave a $30 deposit for a towel, flippers and snorkel and mask which you get back at the end. The snorkeling was fantastic, you can explore a little cave full of fish and the area is huge so you are never surrounded by people who will ruin your quiet time. You also get lunch here, a buffet resteraunt which you can visit as many times as you want and you can have your photo taken holding an igunana, parrots and tucans.

They would happily do anything you asked, and were good at their jobs. They were very friendly, and would talk to you about their families if you asked. Most of them had good English, and were patient with us trying to learn Spanish. They were also likely to pull your leg and joke with you once they got to know you a little. The entertainment staff were also very good, and were quick to know you if you participated in any of their activities, which we did. We had fun playing games and watching the shows, and were even in a couple. The a la carte restaurant was quite tasty, and they have show plates of each meal in case you would like to know what you are ordering. The hotel as a whole was quieter and more relaxed than some of the others, but excitement was only a 5 minute shuttle away if you so desired. We enjoyed the peace, as we were getting away from busy jobs. We also checked out the other Rius we had access to, and preferred ours because the staff were nicer and more relaxed, and it wasn't as crowded. In a nutshell, the Lupita was just what we were looking for. If you want ultra plush or constant excitement, you may not enjoy it like we did, but if you want a consistently good place with relaxation or fun as you choose, this is the place for you.", "Date": "May 8, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "1", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "3", "Location": "3", "Rooms": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "Toronto", "Title": "\u201cBad Experience - Rooms with Cockroaches!!\u201d", "Author": "Pooja_12", "ReviewID": "UR29222475", "Content": "We stayed at the Riu Lupita at Playa Del Carmen for a week around the second week in April.

We had a small deck which over looked the trees and were thus able to watch some lovely birds and strange but harmless animals. The food was very good. Always fresh fruit and the vegetables were very well cooked. There was variety and we always found something good to eat. The grounds were well cared for and the rooms were in smaller apartment like blocks instead of one huge high rise structure. There were three pools: one for children, one quiet for adults who wanted quiet and one for everyone else who liked the activity around the pool like the games, sports, etc. There were shows every night but we only saw two which were excellent. Also there was a band several nights a week and people could dance. It was great dancing outside under the stars. The beach was reached by a shuttle bus that left the hotel every 30 minutes. The beach area was great with sun or shade both offered. There was a buffet lunch with salads, hamburgers, tacos, and, of course, drinks.

The room was typical Riu, with the liquor dispensers and a well stocked mini fridge. The room itself was basically furnished, but kept very clean by our maid. We never had trouble finding loungers by the pools and the water temperature was just right for swimming.

The Beach Club was very nice, serving beer, wine and soft drinks. The food there was limited, but still of good quality.

We arrived at 10:00 am on the 8th and there was a bit of a mix up at the check in. We were told to take a chair and wait. While waiting we saw other people getting their bracelets. We went up to the front desk and this was quickly rectified. We were given our bracelets and a place to store our luggage. We were told to come back at 1:00 to get our room. We went back at 12:00 and were given a room. The rooms are not spacious but we found them more than adequate. There are two double beds, which we found comfortable. There is a 6-drawer dresser, 1 chair, small table and a good-sized closet to hang your clothes in. The bar fridge is well stocked with beer, pop and bottled water. This fridge was replenished 3 times in the 7 days we stayed. We probably went through about 10 2 litres bottles of water. In addition, there is four bottles of liquor in a dispenser above the fridge. We didn\u2019t drink any but I think it was tequila, vodka, rum and gin. The maid service was excellent. We left a tip every day for the maid and our room was well cleaned (generally by 1:00 PM) and she always made a cute towel animal. We ate breakfast and dinner at the Lupita (we were always out somewhere for lunch). The breakfast food was varied and good. There was plenty of fresh fruit for breakfast. The dinner menu was the same. Of the 7 nights we stayed there there was only one night where we could not find anything that rated above ok. I had pork spareribs one night and they were delicious. My wife love the plentiful supply of good guacamole, fresh fruit and pasta with freshly shredded parmesan cheese. The beach is about 2 km from the hotel but this is easily remedied by a shuttle bus that leaves the hotel every 30 minutes and returns from the beach every 30 minutes. There is a 5 minute walk to the Lupita Beach Club from where the bus lets you off. The bus will also let you off at the entrance to Playa del Carmen. It is about a 7 minute walk to 5th Avenue (the main tourist street in PDC). We spent our first day at the Lupita beach. We found the food at the snack bar there very limited. For the rest of our vacation we went to the beach at the Riu Playacar. When you stay at a Riu hotel you can use the facilities at all other (except the Palaces) Riu hotels. The food was varied, plentiful and good at the Playacar lunch buffet. When the bus lets you off at the Lupita beach it is about a 10 minutes walk to the Playacar (you can go by beach or sidewalk..we found the sidewalk quickest). There is a Starbucks in a little plaza across the street from the Playacar. We went to the beach at Tulum and the beach at Akumal. We took a 50 peso cab to the collectivo station in Playa del Carmen and then took the collectivo from there. It was 20 pesos to Akumal (30 km) and 35 pesos to Tulum (55 km). The beach at Tulum is 5 km from where the collective lets you off so you take a 60 peso cab to the beach. The beach at Tulum (El Paradiso) was beautiful but the restaurant on the beach was expensive and the food was poor. We went snorkeling (you can rent equipment there) at the Akumal Bay beach. We saw sea turtles, stingray and a barracuda. You can walk to the beach from where the collectivo lets you off. It\u2019s about a 5 minute walk. The restaurant at the Akumal beach was reasonably priced and one of the best meals we had. You can catch the collectivo back on the opposite side of the highway where they let you off. There are many traveling the highway. We never had to wait more than 5 minutes. We found using the collectivos much cheaper than the packaged trips. They cost up to 99 USD (1,386 pesos) per person. I believe the collectivos are cheap because their main clientele are the local people who work in the numerous hotels along highway 307. You should always arrange the price with the taxi driver before you leave. It is always best to pay in pesos. Lupita to Playa del Carmen is 50 pesos or 5 USD. 5 USD was 70 pesos while we were there in Feb 2009 so paying in pesos is generally to your advantage while in Mexico. The Lupita is a small, clean and quiet hotel. I would strongly recommend it to anyone who does not want to hear disco music at 10:00 at night or walk 300 or 400 metres to their room! The service was 5 star in all areas. My only disappointment was the coffee. I stayed in Cuba last year where the coffee was comparable (better actually) to the best Starbucks serves. I found the coffee at the bar by the pool to be good, but the coffee served in the buffet dining room was very ordinary. If you want a hotel directly on the beach, it will probably cost you an extra 150 or 200 dollars each. I did not mind the shuttle bus and liked being in a smaller and quieter hotel.

The shuttle was fast and simple. We took the opportunity one day to visit the rest of the Riu resorts, at which we had privileges, and frankly, for us (in our late 40s), the Lupita was the winner for two reasons. What we particularly liked was our beach. It was smaller, quieter and a bit more private that the others due to the layout. There was beachfront, plus a raised area with lots of palms where you could have sun or shade. The food was fine, the same as at the other Rius; self-serve bar was wine (red, white and rose) and beer only, which was fine with us. The other bonus to the Lupita is that it has a quiet pool away from the bar/main pool area. Short walk for a drink, but the beauty was being able to lie in the sun or shade and hear yourself think. From what we saw at the other Riu resorts, the pools were all close or interconnected and chairs were packed in tightly. The drinks at the other Rius were of a bit better quality, but what we had was quite acceptable. The rooms were fine, and very clean, although I would prefer to have had a comfortable chair when we wanted to relax in the a/c. The food at the buffet was surprisingly good, with options for everyone. I had read reports that the food at the a la carte was poor, but I beg to differ. We went two nights and were not disappointed either time. The appetizer (large) was a mahi mahi ceviche served on an avocado, and was excellent. The soup was just okay. There were five choices for dinner (two types of fajitas plus chicken, beef and fish options). The desset was a nice and light crepe with ice cream. My guess is that the folks who were disappointed had the fajitas, which looked average. The other dishes were all good. The staff in the restaurant and bar were all friendly...always a smile and \"Hola!\" They work hard, but I never saw one get flustered. The shows were not great, but from what I've heard travelled from Riu to Riu, so you'd get the same wherever you went. I certainly was tired of the version of musical chairs (with a hat) they played with the kids every single night. We were up early so retired early and probably missed someof the shows. Not something that was of great interest anyway. We didn't bother with the disco, but did, unfortunately, hear the kids leaving at 2 a.m. a couple of nights. We have decided to go back to the Lupita.

We have been to other resorts where the quality and selection could not compare. - There is a free shuttle bus that comes by every 30 min that will take you to the town and the beach - By shuttle, it only takes about 5 min to get to town. We really enjoyed having access to a town, and there's a lot to see and do there.

We didn't stay there during the day so it wasn't an issue for us. We typically don't stay at all inclusive but we weren't going for a full week and it wasn't much more $$ than some of the other lower star hotels that had nothing included, so we did it out of convenience, and I'm really glad we did. Food down there (from when we did go out to other places) was more expensive than I remembered.

Food was great,we have lived at all inclusive hotels before and that this was great. We tought it was good service at the hotel,the staff was smiling and always in a good mood! In the bar they served all type of drinks and they tasted great! A little draw back that the hotell is not on the beach maybe,missed that a little! But the bus went up and down every hour. We often took the buss half way when we was on our way to down town Playa del Carmen,perfect! We where out eating every other day,very nice and good shopping i PDC. Try the sushi! It was a lot of people from France there,and like 50 youngsters in the age of 18-20 from Spain. And you could hear that they wear there! Hallo...free bar!. And when all of them came home at night you could hear it in the. The doors at the hotel was self-locking and slamed behind you. A little annoying we that. Not so much problems on the beach bus we that......with all the people. Was most crowded on the 9:30 bus in the morning. But if you took a little earlier it was fine. We tougth that the enterteinment people was great,and polite. Went around the pool and sayed good morning every dag. And it was a lot of thing to do at day time. Vollyball,waterpolo,boule,spanish lessons,bingo,salsa dancing and more. We dident do anything of it,just read a book and relaxed. That was ok too! It was cool with all the iguanas around the place,big once! All in all,we are happy with the stay. We would probebly book a hotel at the beach next time. But its a lot more expencive.

In fact it was the food which let the hotel down, yes there was plenty of choice, but not a lot that went together.

Having arrived and experienced excellent service all round, we were very impressed. We visited a couple of the other Riu hotels and felt that they were very overcrowded compared to this one. The only drawback for some people may be that it is not on the beach but if you like to be in a fairly quiet area, but only a bus ride from the beach and town, then this place is for you. There is a shuttle bus that collects you free of charge from your hotel door and comes every half an hour. This takes you directly to your own Riu Lupita beach which is exclusively for you and consists of an excellent buffet range and drinks. The Lupita restaurant was absolutely excellent and always had a wide variety. Something for everyone!! Staff are very friendly and cannot do enough for you. The entertainment staff were fantastic and kept us very busy during the day with darts, rifling shooting, boules, aerobics, table tennis, bingo etc. Always plenty to do. There was always evening entertainment of some kind, either consisting of a show or an entertainment evening which involved the audience partaking. This was always followed by a kids mini disco. The rooms were very comfortable and spacious. Cleaned every day with fresh towels. A fridge which is topped up every two days but is replaced every day at your request was on hand with 4 optics filled with spirts which are also replaced. This is free of charge and not an additional charge. We cannot praise this hotel and its staff enough. It was lovely to be away from the hustle and bustle but nice to know it is still on your doorstep if you need it. It is very child friendly and all the entertainment staff remembered your name even though they may have only been told once. This hotel is rated a 3 star by Thomson purely because of the facilities it doesnt have that the other Riu's may have.

We choose this resort since it seemed to have good reviews on this site and it was an incredible deal. The resort is very quaint and had a nice relaxed feeling. Our room was very clean and well decorated, but the bed was very hard. We definitely enjoyed the stocked mini bar, but on our first night we were starved and didn't arrived until 10:30 - the food at the snack bar was a few chips, french fries (cold) and sandwich stuff, I would suggest bringing some snacks if you are arriving late. The buffet had a decent selection, but was very \"americanized\" I expected some more authentic mexican dishes, but there were a lot of things like pizza, fries, pasta, meat etc. I had the roast one night and it was amazing! There is one a la carte restaurant which you need to book at the buffet in the morning. We were a little dissapointed with the dinner and thought the buffet was better. We found that most people spoke French during our stay. We had hoped to have a few conversations, but no one really spoke english. We weren't sure if that was a fluke or not. There is a shuttle bus which takes you down to the hotel beach club. It was a nice club with lots of seating and a buffet style with drinks. I would recommend bringing a sealed coffee canister to keep your drinks cool and sand free! You can also go to Riu Tequila, Riu Playacar & Riu Yucatan. The beaches for Yucatan & Tequila (beach club) are a little bigger than Lupita and there is a larger sandy swimming area. We really liked the pool area at Tequila and would recommend going to that resort if you can find a deal (more food options, closer to the water). The entertainment at Lupita is a little lacking. The had a kids mini disco every night where they would call the kids on stage to dance. There was only one kid while we were there so it was kind of funny. The staff who work on entertainment are totally sweet and work hard to get people involved. But, if you are expecting to see an entertaining show every night, this is not the place. The shuttle bus drops you close to the shopping area. My one major recommendation would be to enjoy some of the restaurants on the strip. We had the best shrimp and enchiladas I have ever tasted! And the Dos Equis Amber beer is delish! We were wishing we went to eat in town sooner in our trip, because I think we have have gone daily. We went on one day trip which was the Fat Cat catamaran trip. I would HIGHLY recommend this tour. The guides are super friendly and the boat is big and beautiful. We went snorkeling for the first time and loved it! All in all it was a great trip. Next time I will probably stay at Tequila or try another resort for more food options.

Me and 5 other friends in our twenties stayed at the 4 star Riu Lupita Hotel. It was the cheapest of the Riu's there but the service and everything else was very enjoyable. The buffet was excellent, very delicious and lots of variety, and the waiters were very attentive. There would be some entertainment on the stage outside of the buffet building, that you can see through the window, during dinner, but the shows were aimed at young children and werent that interesting. The bar there is fantastic, very quick and very friendly...my favourite drink is the strawberry dachary. Oh there are some cute animals that roam around the resort...lol very entertaining. There are 2 nice pools at the resort, however I never used them because I spent most of my time at the beach. The resort is quite small compared to the other Riu's but you can stil take a shuttle to the other ones and eat at their buffet for free. The shuttle comes every half an hour until 6:30pm, so whenever we wanted to go out in the evening we shared a cab ride for $5 US. Playa Del Carmen is where all the mini shops are, kind of like a flea market. Very nice area, but expect to have the Mexican store owners being very pushy for you to buy things, also you women, expect to be flirted with a thousand times hahaa. I would say that the shops are geared to more woman cuz there are lots of jewlery stores and womans clothing stores. I cant remember which restaurant we went to but it was a two story one there and the prices were kind of expensive but the staff were very friendly and entertaining. We also checked out the karaoke bar, and it was a little lame, not many people and took forever to get your song started. The rooms at Lupita were very well kept, and our room was cleaned by Maria, who every afternoon left an animal on our bed made out of towels. There is an airconditioner however at times it wasnt cool enough. Our room didnt have any problems with bugs but our friends two doors down had some small ants in the sink.] Now to the beach! So beautiful. Lovely blue waters, white sand, coco nut trees. We went to the Playacar beach. There were a bar in the pool, and had aquatic lessons, however let me warn you that the male instructor is a little on the feminine side. I was able to experience the parasailing. It was different than what I expected, more peaceful than exciting, but to get to the parasailing was fun cuz they take you on the water seado to the speed boat while you wait your turn. This costs $60 Us however I firted my way into $50 US. Great experience if you dont think you will have a chance to do it again. \\i saw some pelicans on that beach too. lol be aware of the topless old ladies and lots of smokers....smokers generally in all of mexico. Our trip to Xelha was from 9am to 5pm one day and it was $75 plus $30 US for the bus. There is snorkeling there, tubing down the river, you can cliff jump, swim with dolphins, get your picture taken with reptiles and parrots and monkeys, and rope walk. Our group did everything but swimming with the dolphins cuz that on its own is around $150. I would say snorkling is the best part of this place, we say two stingrays and other beautiful fish however if you are going to snorkle,d ont make the same mistake we did. We did our snorkling in the wide open sea and by the end of the day doing all the other stuff we didnt end up having enough time snorkleing in the caves and seeing the coral reifs, which i was really looking forward to doing. You can rent the equiopent there, and its a $20 deposit and u get your money back when you return it. anyways, the trip as a whole was absolutley so much fun and I would totally do it again, however one week is not enough time. I would say that 10 days is perfect.

We knew we wouldn't be on the beach and would have to take a shuttle bus, prices for a hotel on the beaches were almost double what we paid. The hotel is small, not too many rooms, which was perfect for us. Staff...at reception, hmm, not too impressed, room cleaning lady..perfect (Silvia), buffet and restaurant staff were incredible. Animation team..so-so. The \"shows\" sucked, sorry, no other word to describe it. A lot of it was people from the audience doing games, boooring. One night we had Mariachis they were amazing. Then we had Cuban strip-club dancers, in g-strings and shaking their jelly all over the stage, talented yes but unnecessarily dressed like prostitutes. Another night was a band with 2 women singers, one of which was about 8 months pregnant, shaking HER jelly and belly with legs spread apart...puh-lease. We were in a room on the top floor facing the main buffet, so we heard the fans and whatever else other machinery that was running on the roof, and in back we had the discotheque bass blaring loudly starting at 11pm. The bar in the room is convenient since we don't have to leave the room to get a soda or drink. I was expecting a whole lot more from the Riu chain of hotels, I guess my expectations were really high, therefore I was disappointed. We were allowed to go to the Riu Playacar, Yucatan and Tequila (which we did not visit since it was across the street and not on the beach). The Playacar and Yucatan and much bigger and more fancy. Food is good, staff seems really friendly. You can find these hotels by walking to the right when you get off the shuttle bus, which also drops you off at the entrance of Playa Del Carmen shopping area. The shuttle passes on the hour and half hour at the hotel, and on the 15 and 45mins at the beach club. The driver is very friendly! I'd say 50% of hotel guests were from France, and the rest were from Canada, England, Finland etc.... Excursions, the only one we did was Chichen Itza, a 3.5hr bus ride away, but think about it, you're already in Mexico and soooo close to visiting one of the new wonders of the world! The tour was $82/person, included luxury bus, food, alcoholic and non-alcoholic beverages (yes you can drink and eat in the bus), the guide (who had an incredible amount of knowledge!), and you also visit a \"cenote\", underground natural pool of freshwater, and you can swim in it too...so beautiful!

I purchased the package from Sunquest a few weeks before our departure and paid less than $1,000.00 Cdn. each. It was a very good deal as I know others paid over $1300.00. each. Our flight both ways was great as we were given the exit row on the plane and so we had ample leg room. The exit at the Cancun airport (which is very modern) and transportation to hotel was a very smooth process. The RIU Lupita is a nice location and the rooms are very clean. The balcony is a nice extra and there was an expandable drying rack for bathing suits, etc. It was nice having the fridge stocked with sodas, beer and bottled water. Having not been to an all inclusive before, I wasn't sure what to expect. The staff are very courteous and we ended up picking up a few spanish phrases to speak to the staff. We tipped the servers and the maid service on a regular basis. The weather was excellent however, the beach at Playa del Carmen has been eroded somewhat with the past hurricanes and large sandbags have been installed. This made it rather difficult to walk the beach. The beach club is adequate with good food, clean washrooms and many palm trees for shade, and ample beach beds. The shuttle from the hotel to the beach is very convenient. You can also stop part way and get off in the shopping district. We walked there a few times from the hotel as it is only about a 20 minute walk from the hotel and the hotel is in a very nice area. The shopping on 5th avenue in Playa del Carmen is great. It is a closed off street with blocks and blocks of vendors. Unfortunately, my partner became very ill on our last full day even though we had taken Dukoral vaccine while still in Canada, and were very careful to use hand sanitizer at each meal. I heard that other people were also ill. Myself, I was only mildly sick. I guess at a buffet style restaurant, you run the risk. Some people are not very clean, handle food with their hands and reuse the same plates. Also, the servers are picking up dirty plates and disposing of the garbage and the then re-setting the tables with new cutlery, etc., without washing their hands. We went on a cruise last year and most meals were buffet style, however, we did not get sick. I believe the sanitary measures on board the ship were more fastidious. As for the entertainment, the live entertainment was good and the Myan show was ok. Some of the entertainment was repetitive, especially the mini-disco where the staff and children staying at the hotel did the same song and dance, every night. We didn't really mind. I wouldnt go back to an all inclusive again, only for the fact that the food is very repetitive and the issue of the sanitation at the buffet.", "Date": "January 5, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "3", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Toronto, Ontario, Canada", "Title": "\u201cRiu Lupita is great, not a 5 star however it is absolutely great\u201d", "Author": "frodoradu", "ReviewID": "UR23052861", "Content": "Awesome is the word that i can describe it in. Ther's a lot i have to say. We booked the vacation through sunquest. We went from dec. 18th to dec. 25th. When we got to the hotel we checked in and went to lunch. After wards we took a shuttle to the beach since the beach is 10 min. away with the shuttle. The shuttle comes every 30 min. and is big enough so you are guaranteed that as many people as there are , you will get there. What me and my family did however is that because you are staying at a riu hotel you have access to all of the other riu's in the area. 2 years before riu lupita we stayed at riu tequila which is a 5 star hotel. From where the shuttle drops you off you can walk about 7 min to the riu tequilla beach, which is better that the lupita beach because the tequilla beach is bigger, you have access to more food, and accses to a bar. There a the lupita beach there is only a dispencer, there isn't a bar. Also at the tequila beach there are more activities for you to do. Enough for the beach. The hotel: the food was better than any i have eaten at any other hotel i have stayed. I have stayed at Sirenis cocotal in punta cana, dominican republic and riu tequila in playa del carmen, mexico which are both 5 star hotels. Riu lupita is a small hotel so there are about 300 people at a time staying there. It is very peacefull. At the hotel there is a bar and an extra mexican restaurant. The pool is very good maintained. But the food is just incredible. They have great ideas everyday. I couldn't eat evertything that was there. The rooms are very clean and nice, the cleaning lady always leaves an animal made of towals on the bed.

I just don\u2019t find it fair now that I experienced it first hand. Our first vacation at Mayan Riviera and although we read a lot before we left, it never does the justice until you experience on your own. Comparing to RIU Tequila or RIU Yucatan it is not as good. But I am sorry, we are more than welcome to pay almost double to stay in these two and there will be no complains : -). And also, people just love to complain about everything. The weather was great, between 28-30C during the day and 25C in the evening. One night it rained, other than that it was sunny and beautiful. This resort is about 5 min drive from the beach and Playa del Carmen. Great for adults, there were no teenagers and small kids. Maybe because we went in December before the school ended, I don\u2019t know. The first night when we came, I was a little disappointed thinking this looked like an average 3 star, not one of the RIU hotels. However, it turned out to be a great value for the money we paid. RIU Lupita is 5 min taxi ride from Playa del Carmen and conveniently located close to other RIU hotels. They tell you that you are allowed to use facilities at RIU Playacar, RIU Tequila and RIU Yucatan. We also went to RIU Palace (5.5 or 6 star RIU hotels) and noone said anything. ROOMS: We arrived early and had to wait 3 hours to get a room. When we finally got the room, it was smelly and there was no hot water in the shower. Not a pleasant experience considering that we haven\u2019t slept the previous night (flight was leaving around 6 am and we had to be at the airport before 4). When we called the reception, they changed our room as soon as they had another one available (next day). Much better: no smell, nicer view, shower worked well. Unfortunately, AC was incredibly loud in all rooms. Our room was very clean and it was always supplied with bottled water, pop, beer and some hard alcohol. STAFF: The hotel staff was really helpful, they came immediately to look after the issues. Friendly and professional, especially at the reception. Thank you. FOOD: We loved it. The selection was there, the taste was great and they always had lots of seafood and meat. We usually had breakfast and dinner at Riu Lupita and lunch somewhere else (Riu Playacar or Riu Yucatan). They had a lot of variety for different tastes. We didn\u2019t try a la carte, the buffet was great. BEACH: As mentioned earlier, this resort is not located at the beach. You can take the shuttle bus to the beach area designated to RIU Lupita or chose another RIU hotel. The water was not as clear as I thought it would be. It is not the turquoise calm and clear water. Strong water currants and large waves. But this is how it is in Mayan Riviera. Unfortunately I can\u2019t say that I liked the beach and being the beach person, this was my only disappointment. Beach in this area is protected by the sand bags but you have to be really careful. POOL: RIU Lupita has 2 pools and no swim up bar. There is also one small pool for the kids. We didn\u2019t stay at the pool much, prefer the beach. It was clean and well kept. EXCURSIONS: Mexico has lots of history and if you are not there just to eat and drink, it is really worth exploring. We did several day trips: Chichen Itza, Tulum, Coba, Cenotes (Grand Cenote, Ik-Il cenote) and Cozumel. You don\u2019t have to spend lots of money to visit these sites (I believe they charge over $100/person/site). ADO buses in Mexico are amazing, better than Greyhound in Canada. Except for Chichen Itza/Ik-Il Cenote we did everything on our own. Chichen Itza is a must!!! You just have to see it to believe it! Someone mentioned that they were disappointed because they couldn\u2019t climb the pyramid there. Well, this was written all over the internet, so if you do your homework before you leave, you\u2019ll know what to expect. $45 for the tour, booked in town, not in the hotel. This was the only organized tour we booked, because Chichen Itza is 4 hours bus ride from Playa del Carmen and we didn\u2019t want to waste our time. And also, you want to hear stories about Mayan people. It is just unbelievable what they knew more than 1000 years ago. The ride was about 2 \u00bd hours. Our tour guide was knowledgeable, we stopped to swim at Ik-Il Cenote and the lunch was included. $5 bucks bus ride to Tulum + $5 bucks for the admission. So $10 dollars/person if you do it on your own. And you don\u2019t necessarily die if you leave the hotel and explore : -). We also took the taxi to Coba; back and forth from Tulum for $40. We climbed the pyramid there, I think I\u2019ll remember this experience forever. Scary a little bit, but well worth it. Amazing snorkelling in Cozumel, we did it on our own as well. Ferry ride to Cozumel and then taxi to the exact same beach where they take you with an organized tour. We just loved to do it at our pace. Beautiful corals, blue/yellow/purple fish. OVERALL: By the end of our stay, we didn\u2019t want to go home. As long as you are not expecting 5 stars experience, you\u2019ll enjoy it.

BACKGROUND: This was my 4th week at a Mayan Riviera resort but for others in the group it was their first vacation. We normally stay at 5 star accommodations and are very laid back people who go with the flow of things. ROOM: At first I was very disappointed in the rooms as there were some small ants in the room that were there the entire stay. We had a main floor bungalow room near the tennis courts and reception area. The rooms are kept clean but the tub wasn\u2019t very clean. The bedding and curtains are showing their age and the towels always had a strange smell, even the fresh ones. Once I got past those issues I think the room was sufficient and met the needs of our group. The room is supplied with hard alcohol, beer, bottled water and pop which are refilled every other day. Our maid cleaned our room daily and was very respectful of our belongings. There is an in room safe in the closet with a hard key (not a magnetic one). At check in you are given a towel card for each person and are responsible to return the towel cards and safe key at the end of the stay and there is a fee for missing cards/keys. The room safe and contents of the refrigerator (pop, beer etc) are included in the price and there is no extra charge for these services. The doors slam shut and we could here most people within our building shut their doors; this might be a problem for those wanting to sleep in. There is no in room clock but we just asked for a wake up call or checked the TV as needed. I rate the room 3 stars. FOOD: Selection was much less than the larger resorts we have previously stayed at but the food was very good. I am a picky eater who does not eat seafood or a lot of meat but I found the food plentiful and delicious. Others in my group ate a lot of seafood and meat and were also very impressed with both the quality and quantity of the food. There is 1 buffet restaurant and 1 ala carte. We ate once at the ala carte and the food was delicious but there weren\u2019t many options for those who don\u2019t eat seafood (still left full though!). The setting at the ala carte is a lot more casual than I expected and I think a person will have to go to Playa Del Carmen for a nicer upscale dinner. There is a snack bar that is open when the buffet is closed that has basic food to get you through until dinner. I ate immense quantities of food but actually managed to lose weight on this trip. I rate the food 4.5 stars. DRINKS: There is 1 main bar located in the main area (pool, buffet, ala carte restaurant, snack bar and bar are all in 1 main area). The bar staff are fabulous! They remember your drink preferences, are quick to serve all patrons and the service is very friendly. There is also a Disco from 11pm to 2am and is the only location to get a drink late at night. The Disco ranges from very lame to fun depending on your attitude as well as other guests in the hotel. I rate the bar staff 5 stars. ANAMATION TEAM: There are events all through the day to keep the fun flowing. Not all events happen at the time scheduled but there is something going on through most of the day. In particular Tadeo was a lot of fun but they are all great. I rate the animation team 5 stars \u201cUn hunh Un hunh\u201d. BEACH: This resort is not located at the beach. There is a bus that drives patrons to the beach every \u00bd an hour with service from 7:30am to 6:45pm with a lunch break with no service. The beach club has a selection of food and drinks, chaise loungers to sit on and bathrooms. We didn\u2019t spend very much time here but found the beach area sufficient and we enjoyed walking up and down the Playacar beaches. If you miss the bus it is a 20 minute walk to the hotel or a $5 cab ride (we never did take a cab but we were told that is the rate). A lot of the beaches in the area have large bladders full of sand to prevent erosion. I rate the beach 3 stars. POOLS: There is a main pool and a smaller quiet pool. The weather and pool water were very cool for our entire stay and we didn\u2019t spend very much time in the pool. The main pool is small but so is the resort. I think it might get crowded when the weather is hot but there is always the beach to go to if you need more space. All of the chaise loungers filled up with people daily, even with cool weather and it being off season. I rate the pools 3.5 stars. KIDS CLUB: We didn\u2019t have any kids with us but because we usually travel with them I took notice of the kid\u2019s activities. Most evening there were no children that participated in the kids show so the Lupita will be good if your kids don\u2019t mind staying with you or will still have fun with low attendance of other children. All the staff was very attentive to the kids who were present but due to the small size of the resort there just weren\u2019t many kids there. I can\u2019t really rate the kids club as I didn\u2019t see enough of it. GROUNDS: Staff work hard to keep the hotel clean but the Lupita isn\u2019t as polished as we are used to. We were able to find several spiders in their webs (I am scared of spiders so I tend to look for them). There is the Coati who were not afraid of people and would come into public areas \u2013 please don\u2019t feed them. There is also something that looks like a big rat but has jackrabbit legs and no tail but we only saw them behind our building and they stayed away from people. I rate the grounds 3 stars. PROS: Smaller hotel so it is easier to get to know people and we became friendly with other guests as well as the staff. The close proximity to Playa Del Carmen was very convenient and the main reason we chose the Lupita. Most of the guests were not from Canada and it was very interesting to be surrounded by so many other cultures (they do speak English here but not as much as other resorts). The price is much more affordable than other resorts and I feel we got a good value for our money. CONS: If you want a luxurious place then this isn\u2019t it as the Lupita is more fun than upscale. OTHER (details for people who book package deals \u2013 not used in deciding the overall rating): We booked with Sunquest but our flight was with Air Transat and the food sucked but the service was great. Flight was 5-6 hours direct. Transportation to and from was part of the package and was on a large tour bus with bathroom facilities. Corona beer was served on the way to the resort for $2USD or $3Cdn. We were the first stop for the bus and the only guests to get off. OVERALL: We will likely return as my impression of the hotel is favourable.

However, taking into account what average British tourists seem to want from a holiday we went, not quite too certain as to what we should expect. It is certainly the friendliest hotel in which my wife and I have ever stayed, with everyone, from the gardeners, cleaning staff, receptionists, waiters and entertainment staff being exceptionally polite and very sociable; they always seemed to have time to spend having a chat about all sorts of interesting things- news, climate, activities, like and dislikes etc. The warm welcome was evident from the moment we stepped off the transfer coach. Even though people had criticised the food in the hotel (every meal was buffet) we found it to be of a very high standard, equalling that of many hotels boasting five stars, even though Tripadvisor only credits it with three. The food was fresh and varied, with such a vast selection being on offer at every mealtime that we were reminded of dining in Las Vegas! The restaurant area was spotless and the service both efficient and polite; a good job that gratuities were included in the price or we could have found ourselves seriously out of pocket. The bar was well stocked, with all drinks available and made up quickly; the staff soon getting to know our likes and dislikes! Nothing was too much trouble for these very smiley people. The hotel is situated some distance from the Caribbean, but we found this to be no problem either as the hotel ran a free shuttle service to and from the beach twice an hour: highly convenient and efficient. Once at the beach their beach club was excellent for drinks and lunch, with the staff being of the same calibre. We are now busily saving to return to the same hotel next October, such was our opinion of it; and this comes from one who has never returned to a holiday destination- such a big world and so few holidays!

After staying at Riu Caribe, Riu Lupita was a huge disappointment. Let me first talk about the positives of Lupita the refrigerator was constantly stocked, nothing to view but vegetation in the back of the building but that was ok we actually got to see a family of meerkats playing and frolicking behind our porch. The beach club was also fantastic it was beautiful with plenty of loungers in the shade or directly on the beach the food was someone what better than buffet at the hotel but the food was out in the open and attracted bugs and birds. The water was fantastic a bit of sea weed but once you walked out a little further that wasn't a problem. I also had two fantastic massages Felipe was fantastic. Those are the only positive things i could say about the Lupita. Lets talk about the negative. Problem number 1 upon arriving at Lupita my friend and I noticed that we were the only African Americans on the property. At certain times we felt like lab mice being inspected under a microscope that is how much we were stared at every time we walked around the property. I felt as if I had a 3rd breast and I was letting all three hang out. We managed to ignore the stares and got use to the fact that no one spoke to us even when we said hi. Problem number 2 none of the wait staff with the exception of Max spoke even a small amount of English. Not even to understand any thing but pepsi and water. Good thing we knew one or two spanish words. One of the bartenders there was particularly rude. What ever drink we asked him for he act like he had no clue what we were talking about. He gave us a hard time everytime we went to the bar we asked for a fruit punch. The drink they gave at the front desk when you first check in and they called it fruit punch he acted as if he has never heard of such a thing. When we asked the other bartender he immediately gave and made any of the drinks we asked for. . The animacion team left little to be desired. They aren't even mediocre. Problem number 3 on our 4th night there around 11:00 pm there was a major rainstorm and low and behold our room started leaking. Water start streaming down the side of the wall where the t.v and the air conditioner was plugged in. We called the front desk and no one understood that we had a leak finally they said they will be sending someone over. We are still waiting for him to come. We ended up going to the front desk the next morning because it was going to storm again and tell them about the room. They said they will move us to a room that has another room above. They instead moved us to another 1 story building identical to the one we were just in. We were going to put up a fuss but at this point we were just tired of having to pack and move and then having to move again. Problem number 4 the food areas, everything is open air. So the birds and the bugs are a serious nuisance and unsanitary. We would be eating at the buffet (which has little variety) and right next to us at the empty tables the birds would be flying in and eating off of the tables not to mention the bugs flying in your food and your drink. The only thing that help us maintain our sanity was our nightly trips to Riu Tequila. They were fantastic. Their animacion team was entertaining. They had a decent night club. We at first didn't know that we couldn't eat dinner at Tequilla so we got to eat there one night and the food was fantastic compared to Lupita and there was no bugs and birds to worry about. All in all I would never stay or recommend Riu Lupita unless your French and Spanish.

I have stayed at many of the other RIU Resorts and the Lupita lived up to what I normally find to be the best. FLIGHT: Our flight from Vancover via Air Transat left on time and took 5hours 30 minutes. No frills with this airline but it works. HOTEL: Yes the Lupita is the smaller in the RIU chain in the area but, it was clean, well maintained, and in my opinion well managed. ROOMS: Good clean room, stalked mini bar, clean towels, but sorry to say very poor water pressure for the shower. STAFF: The staff at the RIU Lupita were excellent, very friendly took pride in everything they did for us. Always a smile Very good entertainment crew and excellend shows. FOOD: Excellent buffett with good choices, one thing I did notice is that if you dont like 1000 island dressing you are out of luck it was the only choice. But all in all very good. POOLS: The pools were very nice, no swim up bar but that not real difference. Bar is so close if required. Clean pools, lots of chairs, and lots of fun. The RIU Lupita is NOT ON THE BEACH.....This to sum may make a difference but I assure you its so easy to get to the beach it made little difference to me or my son. A shuttle runs every thirty minutes and it takes five minutes to get there so dont panic . We did have a theft of a camera from our room, we made a report to the front desk and the matter was treated quickly and to our satisfaction within 24 hours with real RIU Class.

We selected this Riu hotel because we could not figure out if there was a huge difference between this resort and the other Riu resorts right around that area, so we figured to save the money and go with this resort. This was a major let down and the only time we spent at Lupita was to sleep. We were let down because we were under the assumption that there would be more options for food, bars and activities on this resort. There is only one pool that is actually utilized by guest because there is only one bar and one restaurant, so the pool near these is the only one really utilized. We also were told there was a gym on site. There was not. There is one other restaurant than the buffet one and you needed reservations for this restaurant. Multiple times we went to make reservations for the 9PM seating (there was only 2 seatings--7PM and 9PM) and it was booked. We were up and trying to book these by 7:45AM and it was already booked!!! The outdoor \"food\" area that serves fries, ice cream and fruit when the buffet restaurant is closed is GROSS. No one maintains the area and there are birds every where eating the food. We finally learned to wake up every morning and go to one of the other Riu's, which you had to get to by bus which ran every 30 minutes. The bus ride was only about 10 minutes and it dropped you off at one spot where you could walk to the other resorts (10 minute walk to the furthest). We loved Riu Yucatan for their beach and multiple swim up bars. The pool was massive and enjoyable. The biggest problem is getting chairs. People reserve them with towels beginning at around 7:00AM. The best Riu for night life is definitely Tequila. They had great shows, a sports bar with pool tables, a bar, etc, and just an overall great night life vibe. But the bus to Lupita stops running at 6:30PM, so if you decide to stay here for their night lift, you need to get a taxi back to the hotel. Also--when you check in you are told that you cannot eat dinner at any of the other resorts. This REALLY let my husband and I down because we assumed that we could still access all the other resorts restaurants for dinner. No. We did end up eating at some of the other resorts buffets for dinner and just did not tell anyone we were from Lupita. Their food was 100% better!! Just need to take a taxi back to Lupita. Lastly, the service at Lupita is a step down from the other resorts. The entertainment staff is mediocre. And the bar tenders/ wait staff are not nearly as engaging and friendly as they are at the other Riu resorts. The room was nice. It was cleaned every day and we never had an issue with the room at all. If the room hadn't been as enjoyable as it was, this potentially could have been a horrible vacation. I just compared rates and for 4 nights, it would cost $75 more per person to stay at Riu Tequila, $87 per person at Riu Playacar, $86 per person at Riu Yucatan. So only about $20USD per night per person. This would DEFINITELY be worth it!!!! The entire trip we wish we had paid a little more for a huge increase in ammenities and service!

The Good: --------- 1) Small of Size: Riu Lupita is a small all-in resort. This small scale has some advantages, more particularly with respect to getting to know people. Since the place is small you spot people frequently and after a while they seem familiar and this reduces the barrier to have a chat with them. The other bigger Riu brother in Playa del Carmen have a much greater anonymity attached to them mainly because of their larger scale. Another advantage of the smaller scale is that it is easier to find a spot with some quietness, which is not always easy to find in larger scale resorts. More particularly Riu Lupita has a smaller pool where you can relax without having some kids running around and screaming all the time. That pool also has the advantage that it is somewhat removed from the animation team and the sometimes loud music. 2) The bar: the people working at the bar are delivering an exquisite job. They are very fast in serving you even when there's a lot of people at the bar and they are always friendly. 3) Approximately every two evenings there is live music. 4) Although we didn't participate at all in the activities we think the animation team did a great job. The Bad: -------- 1) The food: the quality of the food is quite good, but it really starts to annoy after a while. Especially, if you're here for two weeks it become overly tiresome. We had dinner at the mexican restaurant didn't find much special about it. In fact, we found the buffet restaurant more tasty. The service at the restaurant is simply too fast. Almost empty plates are grabbed from under your nose even before you put the last bit of food in your mouth. There are cooks in the buffet restaurant which can prepare a customized mix of food but the cooks are most of the time already preparing the standard food such that there is few opportunity to ask for customized food. We went for lunch and breakfast in Riu Tequila and Riu Yucatan and there this situation does not exist. 2) Room Cleaning: we found that the rooms were not cleaned thoroughly. In the bathroom there are two rolls of toilet paper. Over the next couple of days they were never replaced such that at some point we ended up with none and had to explicitly ask for toilet paper. 3) Towels: the towels (both the ones for the use at the pool as the ones in the bathroom) are not clean. Sometimes they had a very bad smell attached to them. After having seen the cleaning boy using the towel to clean the toilet (this is not a joke!) we linked one thing to the other -- of course it is difficult to verify whether these towels are always replaced. 3) The window maze that prevents insects from entering the room was broken. We had to ask three times before it was fixed and after our little ordeal (see the ugly part) this was quite important to us. 4) The snack bar is closed one hour before dinner starts, whereas normally the snack bar is supposed to be open when the restaurant is closed and vice-versa. The Ugly: --------- We found cockroaches (3 different ones on one evening!) in our room. Even though the climate of Mexico is favorable to these creatures we think it is plainly unacceptable to find them in your room! At first we didn't get a new room -- they would send someone to treat the room against insects -- but after encountering another one the reception granted us another room. Some Tips: ---------- 1) Free internet: You can use the wireless networks if you take your laptop. You have to sit at a table in proximity of the internet shop where you can pay for internet (3 USD per 20 minutes) if you don't have your laptop with you. Much cheaper internet venues can be found in the center of Playa del Carmen. 2) Beach resort: Riu Lupita is not directly located to the beach. There are buses driving you to its private beach resort every half hour. The beach resort of Riu Lupita is small. Again, the advantage is that its small size warrants peace and quiet if that is what you're looking for. However, its small size also implies much reduced food possibilities. If you want better food facilities and a bigger beach combined with a pool in front of the beach you can visit the beach resort of Riu Tequila, which is about a five minutes walk further down the road than where the bus drops you off. As a Riu Lupita guest you can make use of all the other Riu hotels, except for the two Riu Palace hotels. 3) Excursions: although unrelated to this hotel in particular, you should know that excursions are a big deal here and a lot of money can be unnecessarily be spent on this. We were traveling with Jetair (TUI group). The host for this company is only interested in selling excursions to get commission. On more than one occasion we didn't get all the information. For example, after we booked and paid a trip to Sian Ka'an we heard that we had to pay extra for a taxi to move to the pickup point for this trip. Also, we did an excursion to Delphinus to swim with dolphines. We were explicitly told by Sabine that we would not be allowed to take pictures as they took pictures themselves and would sell these pictures. The latter was true but the former was not. If someone is not paritipating in the programme he can watch and also take pictures. Overall we recommend doing the excursions yourself. It enables you to avoid the crowds and have much nicer experience rather than having the typical school-bus feeling.", "Date": "May 5, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "5.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "new brunswick", "Title": "\u201cAMAZING\u201d", "Author": "stephaniee7", "ReviewID": "UR15555886", "Content": "My dad and I stayed at RIU LUPITA!

I've stayed at all-inclusives before where the buffet is minimal and you get sick of it after one day. I felt like I could've eaten it every day. The fresh squeezed tropical juices they served in the morning were awesome and there was so much variety with the food. My husband really enjoyed the all inclusive drinks including the mini-bar and drink dispensers in our room. Some stuck up people would probably complain about their little shuttle that went to the beach but I thought it was a great idea. It was nice to be at a hotel away from the beach a bit because it was not as crowded. But the shuttle took you down there and dropped you off either for the beach or for shopping all day long. I thought it was really convenient. The only down-sides for me were that the beds were really uncomfortable. The rooms were clean and comfortable otherwise, but it didn't make for a great night sleep for me. My husband said he didn't mind though. He likes a really hard bed and says it helps his back. It was too hard for my liking though. My in-laws said their bed sagged toward the middle too. Additionally, we seemed to be out-numbered by the french. There were a lot of french-speaking guests and hotel staff so most of the entertainment was not in English. That got kind of old for me. One night they had some nice dancers, but otherwise the entertainment wasn't really doing it for me.

If Riu Lupita is considered only a 4 Star in Canada, well I'd hate to see a 5 star. SERVICE The service was a \"prestige service\". It was all about the people during our stay. I cannot say enough about how kind, helpful and wonderful everyone was from the reception desk to the maid service.... Also, the waiters and waitresses were prompt, always clearing your table and providing an exceptional service to their guests. Management was dining everyday with the guests and they were always helpful and friendly. What I liked the most was \"service with a smile\" all the time....We tipped alot, as they deserved every penny/peso. INTRODUCTION We arrived on March 14th around 4:00 pm. The reception was prompt and on-time. They gave us a \"full indepth\" explanation of all th amenities offerred to us. Also, they had a show during the day after we arrived to welcome all their guests (right on stage) and brought out their head supervisors of each section, kitchen, dining room, housekeeping, chefs, reception, landscaping services, etc. ROOM Our room was ready of course and it was on the 2nd level of Building 28. Our room had a king size bed, bar fridge stocked with Coronas, Soda's and 4 huge Bottled Water. Our room balcony overlooked the private pool area which was very \"beautiful\". It also had lots of Towels, 4 bottle liquor dispenser on the wall, television with many channels, lots of space to move around in the room, etc. No complaints. Just had a confusing time getting our little travel alarm clock to work, as when you switch off the main switch in the room, it powers down the whole room....but we figured it out. The room had a wicked super A/C unit. Always nice and cool. Nice tiled floor and the cleanliness was superb. HOUSEKEEPING We fell in love with our maid \"Leyci\". We left her lots of little treat bags everyday and I gave her a gift (gold earrings). She was so surprised but grateful. She was top notch, the room was always immaculately clean. POOLS There was 3 pools, Private Adult Pool, \"The happening\" lively pool in the main resort area and a children's pool. We spent most of our time at the private quieter pool. BARS & FOOD/DINING There was a bar open day and night with a snack bar open durintg the times when the main buffet was closed. The main buffet was open 7-10 am, 1-3 pm and 7-11 pm. There was an \"A LA CARTE\" restaurant where we eat once. It was pretty good, there were 4 main entree choices that was of course (a 5 course meal). You could order the Steak, the Chicken, the various fish plate or Pork. I ordered the chicken and it was plenty filling. My husband ordered the the Steak, but wasn't enough, so ordered another steak. You just have to ask. The food at the Buffet was \"a variety\" of wonderful food. Breakfast offerred pancake/waffle/french toast station, an omelette/ egg station, 2 other stations, one with bacon/ham/sausage, veg - Another one with Mexican breakfast food choices. There was also a station of various cereals, a station for toast and various breads and of course all the yogurt, cottage cheese, etc. There was a Fruit Station with every kind of fruit known to man and a juice blending station. As well, there was always coffee, expresso, cappucino, juice. Lunch and Supper were pretty similar, except supper was more variety and different foods to choose from. Chicken, Steak, Fish, Lobster even, shrimp, always something different to choose from. We had a hip of beef one night, a roasted pig one night, lamb one night, a big carved turkey one night, always a feature meat they were carving.... Always a mexican station was always set up. You have to have the Guacamole! Yum and always fresh, you can tell....Wine every night if you like...wine. Desserts were plentiful, although I didn't eat dessert too often. They always had steamed vegetables, rice, potatoes of different types, 5-6 different salads, Deep fried bananas or apples....too funny! Food was excellent tasting, we never got sick at all and felt great throughout our whole trip. We ate at the Beach Club twice. Its pretty good, not as much variety, lots of salad, veggies, hamburgers, Fish or Chicken or Pork, fries, nachos, pasta, vegetables..... BEACH AND BEACH CLUB The beach was nice. Yes of course its deteriorated a bit, there were sand bags in the water, but there was enough beach to relax and enjoy yourself. You can walk along the beach, some areas are washed away but this is not a huge problem! There was lots of beach to enjoy. How much beach do you need really?? SHUTTLE Shuttle service was excellent, every 1/2 hour on the hour, prompt and reliable, on-time service. Two different drop and pick up points. He made the first stop at the start of Playa Del Carmen, 5 min walk to 5th avenue from drop off point. Then the Beach Club where you are dropped off and walk down a little tunnel walkway to the Beach Club, takes you 5 min. GYMS/FITNESS We are very athletic people, so since there was no gym at Riu Lupita, we trained at \"The Gym\" in Playa Del Carmen for $15 per day. It was nice. Top of the line equipment. Since you are allowed to use the facilities and eat breakfast or lunch at Riu Playacar, Riu Tequilla and Riu Yucatan, we trained at the gym in RIU Yucatan one day, it was \"alright\" but not enough stuff for us. TRANSPORTATION OTHER THAN SHUTTLE If you want to go into the city at night after the shuttle stops at 7:30 pm, a cab is $5 no matter where the drop off is in Playa Del Carmen. From Playa Del Carmen, hitch a cab throughout town to other stops for $3. All in all, we had the best trip ever and RIU Lupita is the place to go!

The grounds and rooms are attractive, but accurately rated at 3 stars. Try to get a top floor room, as ceilings are higher and rooms are quieter, in that the floors have little sound insulation and there have been complaints about the sounds from above; also ask for a portion of the resort well away from the restaurants / entertainment. Food quality was variable; excellent on three evenings, fair (at best) on four. The a la carte restaurant was poor, and it serves the same thing every night. Word seems to have gotten around -- it was seldom full. Food and (all-included)l iquor are abundant, in some cases excessively so. A dubious feature is a rack of four bottles of spirits affixed upside-down to the wall in the rooms, with a dispensing device at the bottom of each. Attached to wall is a notice that the bottles will be replaced no more than once every two days, suggesting a maximum consumption of a bottle / day per person, double occupancy. Given that there is a large bar open most of the day as well as wine avaialable at the restaurant this a bit over the top. Entertainment -- musical groups -- were generally good, but unfortunately the amplified sound made it difficult to have a quiet dinner. To swim in the ocean is a 15 minute bus ride that is not very pleasant. There are no changing facilities. You can have a great time at Lupita espeically if you come with a goup or friends or family. The children's program is active, and it might be a particularly good destination for a family with young children. The service is uniformly very good and helpful. The value -- especially if purchaed as part of a package -- is very much there. All in all, we would not return, in that there was a bit of mismatch between our interests (a quieter more romantic hotel near the beach) and what the hotel offered, and our disappointment in food quality.

I must admit I got a bit worried 'bout going to the lupita, because I had the idea that it would be kind of boring because it's the smallest of all riu's. This really isn't true: After one day at this hotel we already felt like we were at home. The big advantage of this hotel is the fact it's that small. The pool area, bar, entertainment area and restaurant are all in the same place and it's just cosy. It's also way much easier to get to know the people working and staying there if it's not as crowded as like in the other riu's. We visited the tequila and yucatan once in the morning, because my friend is a travel agent and she just wanted to check them out, but after one hour in both hotels we just wanted to go back to Lupita :-) Other riu's were overcrowded and the people stay!ing there weren't really our kind of ppl.. Annoying american girls for example :-) I see some ppl complain about the french at the lupita, but it's really not that bad. We got to know some great ppl from france, from canada, etc. I think it also depends on your attitude, we had the advantage that we spoke french quite well so it was easier to mingle. Rooms are of a decent quality, without great luxury, but we only were in our room to prepare for the night and to sleep, so for us, it was quite ok. Most important thing is that the rooms are very well cleaned, and if you leave a tip, you always get a free towel art piece of the housekeeping staff. How do they do this? Really amazing!! Food was also of a very good and high quality. Of course it's different from our cuisine, but you have to try and taste some new things. Breakfast was good with a great variety, we only went to the buffet twice, but it was quite ok. We always had lunch and dinner in our hotel, and it was very very good. Vegetables, different sorts of meats, local food, pasta, pizza, grill.. Especially at dinner it was nice, because every night there was a theme night, italian, mexican, spanish, night.. Very good! Staff was very friendly, if you're finished, you don't have to wait long before they take your plate. Also the bar staff was amazing, we'll especially remember the \"chief\", andres, very funny and nice guy. Beach club: we only went once to this beach club, it was nice over there, it's not \"right\" on the beach, but it has a nice view and the restaurant over there isn't bad either. Of course not as varied as in the hotel itself, but it was ok. Shuttle didn't arrive on mexican time, it actually arrived too early :-) What a surprise!!! (but a pleasant one :-) Entertainment was of a very good quality. During the day there are lots of activities. If you want to join in, ok, if you want to skip it, it's ok.. they aren't as pushy as in some other resorts, dragging you of your chairs into joining them. Evening entertainment was sometimes \"professional\" with latino or broadway show, but we so liked the shows of the entertainment team themselve, especially the crazy shows. Not as professional maybe, but their enthusiasm and the sarcasm of that show rocks. We also had tons of laughs with the mister riu lupita contest (and we got the full monty, as promised...). You can see they love their job and they're doing it great. Our \"favorites\" are without any doubt Lalo, such a crazy outgoing guy, always smiling and Roberto: We had a couple of talks with him and maybe he isn't the hottest guy around (although he's quite cute :-)) but he's really nice and being himself without having to put up a great show. If he's in the area just make sure there are no glasses around, because he seems to break them sometimes :-) Party at playa del carmen rocks too... We went out like 5 times with the entertainment staff and some clients, 2 times to blue parrot and 3 times to the Bali. I must say, bali was more my kind of thing, a nice club, nice atmospere too and not that big. It was a great way to get to know some ppl of the hotel. I even had to drag one of them to the toilettes because she couldn't do the steps by herself (so you see open bar isn't always good). But in general we had a great time over there. Blue parrot was also very nice, but just different. We went like 3 times to the hotel disco, 2 to the one of the riu tequila (very crowded with lots of screaming and drooling teenagers, I'm too old for that :-)), and we went 3 times on our own downtown. Unfortunately there was a queu to get in bali and after 20 minutes we got tired of waiting and went to the blue parrot :-) The country itself is magnificent too. We did go on excursion for 4 days. We went to coba - pac chen. Coba is a real must, especially because you can climb the temple and you have a magnificent vue on the jungle. Driving around the site on maya limo is also quite nice, but I felt sorry for the guy that had to pull us.. -) Pac chen was quite adventurous with rappel and canoeing and so on but it was really nice. We also went on a quad excursion, what an adventure!! Both me and my friend were on the back with one of the guides as drivers. So it happened quite a lot that they waited for 2 minutes to get everyone ahead of us, and then they took off, racing, I even got on the highway with my guide. I must say it's quite an experience.. :-) We also went to chichen itza, normally we should've seen the snake but unfortunately there was no sun, it actually rained, so it was quite a bummer.. We also went to go to tulum and xel ha. Xel ha was quite relaxing and tulum quite exhausting (hot hot hot), but tulum is such a beautiful site nearby the ocean, magnificent view!!! If you're looking for a nice, quiet hotel with a great atmosphere, without expecting too much of luxury, you should go to this resort. I already know I'll return within a couple of months for sure.

If you have stayed at a 5 star resort like a RIU Palace, this is not that. However, if you want to save money, eat at 4 RIUs' and explore Playa del Carmen, this is the way to do it. Tip: You have to get a room looking out to the quiet pool. These rooms have high ceilings and are very close to the main pool and the dining area. The rooms were nice and clean and had the same linen and sheets as the RIU ocho Rios in Jamaica that is a 5 star. The person with the dirty bathtub was probably isolated. I checked out late and was able to use a room in the 1000 block. These rooms have a terrible view and have low ceilings. However, they were clean and tidy. None of the rooms have an alarm, I am not sure what is up with that. Good Parts: Rooms are fine. If you are not paying for a 5 star why do you feel you should get that? I did not spend more than a couple of hours a day in my room. I went to the Tequila, the Playacar and the Yucatan and had either lunch or Dinner at either. I went to Chichen Itza and did the edventure tour(Awesome). I have stayed at the RIU ocho Rios in Jamaica and compared to that one this RIU is a 3, but the food is great, the service is great, the pools are clean and the shuttle is on TIME! The driver looked at the watch like every other minute and was timely for everything. I thought the playacar had the best beaches. The shuttle drops you off about 2 blocks from the Fifth and picks you up there as well. You cannot go wrong. If you can get this hotel significantly less than the other RIUs do it. If you go on vacation and just lay by the pool or beach and dont like to venture out, this is not the one for you. Pay a little more and stay at the Playacar. If you want to spend a lot more than stay at the Palace, they are amazing!!!! The two Place are definately 5 star and beautiful in every way. If I go again, I will probably stay at the Hotel Cielo since I met Henry (the concierge)and the hotel is one block off the beach right on 5th by all the shops.

We flew West Jet out of Hamilton- and i cant say enough good things about the flight!Hamilton airport is so much nicer , smaller then Toronto. We arrived in the early evening into Cancun. The Lupita is the smaller of all the Riu resorts. There was only 4 of us checking in to the resort, check in was simple and quick- we were offered a glass of fruit juice while we listened to the facts. Or room was on the second floor by the tennis courts. No complaints . The room was clean, bar fridge was stocked every 2 days, air conditioning worked well, our balcony overlooked the golf course- nice and private. Then bed was firm , but we have a firm matress at home so did not mind it. I have to say the pillows were sparse, but we managed okay. We actually got cold at night with the airconditioner running and found a nice soft blanket to put on the bed (hidden in the closet) There was no alarm clock, but we were up when the sun came up anyways and if we needed to be up sooner we just asked for a wake up call at the lobby. The food was awsome- good variety. We liked that there was just one main eating area, it kept things simple . Service was fabulous- they were always very attentive to filling your cups with aqua vino and coffee. There was no coffee makers in the room but that was okay as it got us up and out of the bed early. We spent very little time at the resort as there is so much to do and see - you are always busy., but for those who like to hang at the resort, you could usually get a lounger either beside the quiet pool or the busy pool. We went to our private beach club once and the playacar beach once. I preferrred the private beach club . There is not alot of beach , and the water is rough... but was still nice to lye by the beach for a switch. Shopping---- awsome...we went to playa del carmen several times... bought lots of souvenirs. We would shuttle down dring the day and taxi at night as it was a little far to walk. Taxi is a 5.00 fglat rate anywhere in the area. We took a ferry to Cozumel one day and just roamed around on foot- had a nice lunch at a restraunt. I found alot of the jewelry shops to be higher end in Cozumel. We were there during superbowl and watched the game at the Riu Tequila sports bar...... this was an awsome night and we had an introduction to the many yummy drinks that were served down there. I recommend the Mojito's and the flaming mayan coffee....mmmmmmmmmmmm. We never had any rain! Lots of sun and more sun. We went to Tulum for a 1/2 day, this was worth the trip, the beach there is amazing. Dont wear your sun glasses into the beach though as tyhe waves will knock you down and you will loose them as i did. Entertainment was good and staff were all friendly and always looking to involve everyone in activities. If your into exploring .... lots of place4s to eat and drink in playa del carmen... beer in town is cheap 1-2 dollars a beer. To sum it all up i would go back in a heart beat... i already miss it! My husband golfed- shuttle ride to the course, 200.00 a round , includes a cart and lunch. He thought it was worth it... very nice course- would finish the game around 100pm or so.

However we were not disappointed. The hotel is in the middle of a golf course, its about 10 yrs old and smaller than the other RIU hotels in the area. There is one large restaurant, the pool bar which is the bar for the evenings. there is also a Mexican restaurant you have to book . The food was fab, themed nights, and the staff in the restaurant were brilliant. They always seemed to have something to smile about. The pool/bar area is the \"noisy\" area and there is a smaller pool not too far from it, which was the \" quiet\" pool area, which suited many people. There were plenty of things going on if you wanted to join in. Excellent entertainments team. There was a bus every half hour to the Beach Club, it stopped just off 5th Avenue near the shops. It was a ten minute trip. The Beach club was ample, with food and facilities. Being in a RIU hotel enabled you to go to the other RIU hotels, other than the 2 Palace hotels. We went to RIU Playacar several times on the beach. It was good to have a walk and be able to pop into the others RIU for a drink. The rooms have the mini bar...... which is re stocked every other day with beer, soft drinks and water. There are optics for spirits, we didnt use them! We had a few issues with the rooms but they were resolved within 24hrs.(nothing serious) We were curious at the end of each day to see what had been made out of towels in the rooms........an artform. Some of the things were amazing. Towels were provided for the pool and beach. There was a good hairdryer in the room, a TV to. The only big gripe we had was people above us, the floors are tiled, and if people will insist on wearing heels, its not good for the people below, as we found out at 5am one morning!!! The hotel was mainly of French and Canadians, So if you're British and dont mind the French or Canadians then you'll enjoy this place. I just hope they have fixed the coffee machines for the next time I go there!!! They seemed to have a few problems with them.

Beach Club: SPECTACULAR! white sand, extremly clean beach, NO ROCKS, pure sand, nicest beach out of all the Riu's. Entertainment: Nightly shows were hilarious, although there was some sexual humor. i would DEFINANTLY go back to this resort anytime! Also, i think i should mention something else.

Due to a supposed error on the part of our tour operator, we did not receive the 'family room' we had booked, which was to have a king bed and a twin bunk bed for our 2 kids. Instead we got one of their regular rooms with two double beds, next to the smaller pool. The room was so small we had trouble moving around in it with 4 people and our luggage. As mentioned on other reviews, the decor is quite dated and there is nothing luxurious about the rooms, beds or bathrooms. They are pretty basic. The following day we moved to the family room, which was definitely more spacious, and being on the second floor rather than the first, it had a vaulted ceiling which made it feel even roomier. It was also more recently renovated than the rooms surrounding the small pool, so we were much happier there. The beds are hard like a rock, as mentioned, but we had no trouble sleeping on them. The resort is small, quaint and well-maintained, but is definitely not a 5 star. But for the price we paid, we really were pleased with its lushness and cleanliness. Because it's small, you get acquainted with the staff and other guests fairly quickly. The main pool, bar, restaurant and event stage are all in one small central area. It has a more homey feel that the larger resorts. There are very few Americans, lots of Canadians, French and other Europeans. I did not encounter any of the rudeness mentioned in other reveiws whatsoever. I found it refreshing going somewhere with lots of Europeans and hearing other languages. Yes there are always cultural differences, yes the Europeans tended to smoke a lot, but it will only bother you if you focus on it. Whenever we called the front desk to request things like extra towels, water, repair, etc. it was always done very quickly. The staff for the most part were extremely friendly and helpful, in particular the housekeeping and restaurant staff. It doesn't hurt to tip a little here and there. The entertainment staff were awesome - they really elevated our experience, particularly for our kids, from 'you get what you pay for', to 'we got more than expected'. From morning till night, they had one activity after another, beach volleyball, horseshoes, riflery, darts, ping pong, water polo, water volleyball, snorkeling, poolside shows and games, and evening entertainment (some of which was extremely entertaining). Our kids were occupied all day and had the best time, which made it easy for us to relax and enjoy the sun, the pool and some of the activities. The food was decent as far as food in Mexico goes. The buffet was fresh and plentiful at every meal, but it does get a bit boring after a while. The fish was always a great choice, being the freshest, most tasty thing at most meals. Nothing was fabulous, but Mexican food is not usually a highlight of visiting Mexico even at the nicer resorts. Just a warning if you enjoy drinking, this resort does not have good alcohol, it is bottom, bottom shelf. Draft Corona was available in light and dark, and you could get decent wine at lunch and dinner, but the hard alcohol was disappointing. The bar staff will try hard to please, though, so if you're not picky like me, you'll find something you like. If you're particular, buy a bottle at duty free! They made a big deal over Christmas, including an extravagant dinner presentation, gifts for the kids from Santa, very festive! The beach is unfortunately decimated and we ended up staying at the pool most days. There is very little beach left at the properties you can access through Riu, but getting there is easy enough, and the town of Playa del Carmen, which you also get to easily on the resort shuttle, is definitely worth visiting for it's shops and restaurants. To summarize, this trip was well worth the cheap price, mainly because the resort is quaint and well-kept (despite the basic, non-luxurious rooms), the staff are extremely friendly, the entertainment crew was so much fun, the food was pretty decent, the pool was never too crowded and the atmosphere was homey and fun and friendly. Had I paid much more, I might have been disappointed, but I feel like I got more than I bargained for. I was hoping it wouldn't be a dump because it was so cheap. It certainly was not a dump, and if you don't set your expectations too high, you can have a fun and relaxing vacation there at an extremely affordable price.", "Date": "January 1, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "4", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Toronto", "Title": "\u201cGreat!\u201d", "Author": "otak55", "ReviewID": "UR12047277", "Content": "I stayed at Riu Lupita with my boyfriend, our 2 friends and my family from Dec 21 to Dec 28, 2007 (came back yesterday) and I must say that even though I would rate the hotel itself a 4 star, I had a truly 5 star expecience on my vacation. The check in was very fast and pleasant and the receptionists spoke good english, french and spanish. We got a room in block 11, on the first floor. Initially i was disappointed because on my privious vacations at other resorts, rooms on the first floor were very humid, but when we checked out our room it turned out to be quite nice and the air conditioning was working great. We were overlooking the golf course with nice lakes, so the view was very pretty. But i can imagine that the views from 2nd and 3rd floors would be even nicer. The food at the hotel was nice and fresh, and there was a lot of variety. I loved the dinner choices, there were different kinds of foods every day: pork and beef steaks, different kinds of fish, ribs, sausages, chicken wings, and seafood. The christmas dinner was just amazing, there was everything that you can think of! Every morning after having breakfast at our hotel we would take the shuttle to Riu Lupita beach club and then walk to Riu Tequila/ Riu Yukatan/Riu Palace beaches. We always stayed at the Riu Palace beach and ate lunch at the beach club (I'm not sure if it was Yukatan or Tequila beach club since they are all together). Since you are able to enjoy the other Riu properties, it really makes your stay at Riu Lupita almost equivalent to staying at any other Riu, it feels like you are staying at one huge resort. Initially we planned to stay at Riu Tequila, but then came across really good prices for Riu Lupita. We paid 1135$ CAD per person, whereas similar vacation for Tequila cost about 1600$ CAD per person at the time of our booking. Hence we saved quite a lot of money and rather spent some of it on various trips and other entertainment. So if you come across a very good deal for Riu Lupita, dont hesitate to book it, and you will still enjoy the other RIUs and will NOT miss out on anything!!! Depending on how busy the hotels are, you may even be able to eat and drink at the Palaces (at the beginning of our vacation, my parents stayed at the RIU Palace Riviera Maya beach, ate lunch there and used their facilities). For my next vacation I would want to stay at RIU Tequila or RIU Yucatan, as they are more livelier at night and RIU Tequila has a pretty good nightclub where we partied one of the nights. RIU Tequila is mostly booked by younger - middle age crowd (20s -40s) who enjoy nightlife and lots of drinking. During our stay we did a few trips: Xel Ha, Tulum, and ATV explorer. We enjoyed all of them. The cheapest and fastest way to get to any of these places is my taking the collectivos and buying tickets at the door. You will save a lot of money, avoid waiting for other people and get there and leave whenever you want! Xel Ha was 75$US, Tulum was 4.50$US, and ATV explorer tour was 55$US but if you are buying it for a few people you can as if they could give you a discount, we proposed 50$US and they said it was fine. This ATV tour was about 2 hours long and was lots of fun! you go through the jungle on the small individual four wheelers (but can fit 2 ppl), ride over big rocks and hills. Then there is a stop where they take you to a beautiful cenote, where you can take a swim. There water there is crystal clear and the caves are amazing, and you can take beautiful pictures. If you go on this tour, bring a bandana to cover you nose and mough as it is very dusty on the way, or you can buy a bandana there for 5$. The day at Xel Ha was also great! We bought the all inclusive option for 75$ and it was well worth it, you can eat and drink all you want and you get the snorkeling equipment, lockers and towels. We ate at the Mexican a la carte restaurant there, it was nice, but then the buffet had the exact same food plus many more choices, so eat at the buffets. Tulum is gorgeous, and we went there in the afternoon, right after lunch. You will need about 2-3 hours, and you can either pay to get a guided tour, or you can just join a random tour group once inside (there are a lot of them).", "Date": "December 29, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Calgary, AB", "Title": "\u201cGreat Service!

I who spots these thing's found out was he was really like. =most of the bar staff in all the hotels will give your teenagers alcohol with or without knowing thier age so watch out! OTHER THAN THAT I WOULD DEFENITLY GO BACK TO THE RIU FOR ALL THE REASONS ABOVE BUT PROBABLY I WOULD TRY TO BOOK THE RIU YUKATAN OR RIU PLAYACAR BOTH BEAUTIFUL AND GREAT NEW ROOMS 2 POOLS BARS GREAT SOCIALISING AND FUN,and I would visit the Lupita as the rest of the staff where wonderful THEY never expect tips and don't really serve you any different if you do give. THE NIGHT LIFE IN PLAYA DEL CARMEN IS EXCELLENT BARS CLUBS BEACH PARTIES EVERY NIGHT, THE BLUE PARROT IS THE BEST, you don't need the staff to take you out but if you do go with them and if your shy it will help you meet other holiday makers and you get all drinks for the price you pay around $10.They can even take you to Cancun for clubing for about $30 all in and takes about 45 min drive. HOT TIPS- goto to tulum history on the beach either by public transport and bus for \u00a32 will take you its soooo easy or get a cab for $20 if more than 2-3 travelling. Some other trips book with tour operator not in town unless you speak spanish as I had awful experience with booking in town it is cheaper but could ruin your trip.( I thought my son had been kidnapped as when my son got in bus to cool off with my neice the drivier drove off with no explaination) I was left crying for 30 minutes and on there return I was told off for worring for nothing and that they thought my son would enjoy the ride. ifact they were juggling two trips on one day and had to collect some money or something!! NEVER AGAIN you need english speaker there and tour company's guarantee this. HOPE I HAVN'T PUT YOU OFF IN ANY WAY WE REALLY DID HAVE A GREAT TIME BUT I NOTICE EVERYTHING GOOD AND BAD AND I ONLY WANT YOU TO HAVE THE KNOWLEDGE BEFORE YOU GO SO YOUR HOLIDAY WILL BE EVEN BETTER THAN ITS GOING TO BE ANYWAY. a.a from Fulham, LONDON", "Date": "November 30, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Salmon Arm", "Title": "\u201cOverall Very Good\u201d", "Author": "DougHeather", "ReviewID": "UR11061060", "Content": "Background: My wife and I stayed at the RIU Lupita from Nov 16 to 24, 2007. We had read many reviews on Tripadvisor to help us choose an appropriate resort. We have stayed at numerous 5 star resorts over the years in Cuba, Puerto Vallarta and the Mayan Riviera and have considerable experience with all-inclusives. We booked with airmiles so only had to pay the tax and a small supplement. The price for the resort and previous reviews helped us pick this property as matching our needs. I will try and be as impartial and unbiased as possible. I will also try to write this review including both the male and female perspective because apparently they are somewhat different. Our vacation goal was seeking a week of sun, relaxation, reading, stress relief, good food and good drink while paying a reasonable price. Airport: Customs was a breeze and we had no difficulty making it through to the Sunquest Rep without being hassled. The shuttle was away quickly as there were only 3 groups going to our resort. The trip took a little over one hour due to traffic. Check-in: The lobby is fairly small but nicely appointed. The check in procedure was very efficient and the staff friendly and accommodating for any requests or stupid tourist questions. We were off to our rooms without much delay. We chose to take our own bags as the distance to our room wasn't very far and the bellboy was tied up aright at that moment. Rooms: We had sent an e-mail in advance requesting a king size bed (didn't bring the kids) and a second or top floor room. We got two doubles and a main floor room. I went back to the lobby and requested a change. the staff had no problem but there were none available. They said we could have the room we wanted the next day and if we left our bags packed they would take care of everything. This was done the next day with no hassles and no inconvenience other than not being able to unpack. the rooms themselves are small and a little dated but not a big deal for us. The counters in the bathrooms are almost non-existent which doesn't leave too much room for toiletry bags but we made do. The wife declared the bathrooms and the bedroom to be exceptionally clean which was the most important thing. Grounds: The grounds are quite nice and very clean and well kept. I have seen lusher grounds on other resorts but there is no criticism for the quality of the grounds at the Lupita. This resort is small in comparison to many others which is part of its charm. Pools: The main pool is small but is an appropriate size for the resort. There was never a problem getting a pool lounger at any time of the day and the pool was never crowded. By comparison the pools at the RIU Playacar and the RIU Yucutan were packed and you couldn't find a lounger at 10:00 a.m. I will say that the loungers at the Playacar were far more comfortable than the Lupitas. They had cushions and Lupita had just stretched nylon. A world of difference for napping eh. The animation staff were always doing some kind of activity but they were not obtrusive. You had a choice to participate or not and were not pressured if you chose not. There were some topless ladies poolside but they were discreet and not offensive to anyone. If you don't want to see, don't look. Bar: There was only one bar and the service was excellent. You never had to wait for a cocktail and they were skilled in making whatever you want. This was the first resort that I have been able to get a Caesar at and a pretty good one too. The issue of watered down liquor is one I do not have an answer for. I am suspicious because I don't normally drink hard alcohol and know the effect it has on me. It did not seem to have the same effect here and I don't think it was the humidity. But who knows, you decide. Food: Ah my favorite thing about all inclusives. I am not a picky eater and will try almost anything. I only insist on quality. Hot things must be hot and cold things cold. It must be fresh and prepared well. The food at the RIU Lupita is excellent. While the buffet is smaller than the \"big\" resorts I have stayed at there was always a really good variety of things to try. The quality was there and all my prerequisites were met. There was something different on the carvers table each day and there was a theme specialty each night. I gained more weight on this trip than any other so far so that is a testament to the quality of food. The Mexican restaurant was very good as well and we thoroughly enjoyed it the time we went. Some acquaintances did not enjoy it the night after but I don't know if they are picky or it was a different night. We never hit the snack bar as we were always stuffed from other meals but it looked pretty good. Didn't look like you would want to go for a burger once they had sat for awhile though. Fitness: In light of the above category I like to work out on holiday. this resort does not have a facility but you have access to the one at the RIU Yucutan. The gym was quite small considering it services four large resorts. Off times it was OK but in prime time (7:00 a.m. to 10:00 a.m.) it was extremely crowded. So much so that an effective workout was impossible. Having to travel by shuttle to the beach and walk 10 minutes to the gym was annoying and having to go back after to shower even more so. The equipment however was functional and everything worked. Beach Club: The Lupita answer to not being on the beach is to offer a shuttle to a private beach club. The lounger area was nice and quite large but the actual beach and water wasn't the greatest. This section of the Mexican coast is just OK and not nearly as good as Akumel which has a spectacular beach and snorkeling. (nice day trip by the way) The food at the beach club is as good as the resort, just a mini version of it. There is no bar which is disappointing as there is nothing like an umbrella drink while watching the waves. Other RIU's: You have access to a number of other RIU resorts and we tried the Yucutan and the Playacar for a day each. The Yucutan was way too big and crowded but the Playacar was very nice with a good blend of size and amenities. We did enjoy going back to the serenity and atmosphere at the Lupita at days end. Guests: We had read a number of reviews dealing with the high proportion of French at the resort but we felt that given what we were looking for in a vacation that would not be a problem. And for the most part it wasn't. We had a couple of incidences of rudeness but I don't think that it was nationality at play, just rude individuals. What we did notice however was a high proportion of smokers and they for the most part were completely inconsiderate of non-smokers rights. We at different times were smoked out of the bar, the pool and the restaurant where twice smokers invaded the non smoking section and light up without the slightest concern for anyone else. We are pretty intolerant of second hand smoke and found this to be the biggest drawback to this resort. Kids Club: We had read about a kids club and saw a small facility but we saw no evidence of a kids club in action. We have taken our kids on a trip so we realize what is important for them, mainly other kids and fun stuff to do. There were very few kids at the resort and I felt sorry for them as there did not seem to be anything special for kids. Also felt sorry for their parents who were now the main source of entertainment. Shows: The nightly entertainment was pretty good overall. I have seen ranges of fantastic to horrid at other resorts and the Lupita held up pretty well. Some shows were very well done and a couple were pretty lame but I can't say that I walked away not enjoying at least something from each show. If you can make sure you see the Mayan show which is spectacular. It starts a little slow but give it time. Its great. Overall: On balance we had a very good time at the Lupita and enjoyed our vacation. The atmosphere allowed us to get what we were looking for. The RIU Lupita is rated anywhere from 4 to 5 stars depending on the brochure or sign you are reading. I would give it a 4 star. Some things are 3.5 and some are 5. In retrospect I think I would have spent the extra few hundred dollars and stayed at the Playacar.", "Date": "November 25, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "1", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "bolton", "Title": "\u201ca french mess on a packed bus\u201d", "Author": "h4pyc", "ReviewID": "UR10733297", "Content": "Where to start?

Upon arrival check in was quick and we were on our way to our room. The room was comfortable and clean, with the same amenities as other Riu's, (although I have to say we never spent alot of time there). The pool was small but a great place to cool off when needed. The food was great, no complaints there at all. There was only 1 bar but seeing as the resort was not so big it was not a problem. You can also rent mopeds or bicycles right on the resort which we did and had a great time! The only problem we did have at the hotel was mosquito's. The hotel sprayed every night around dinner time so you could not have your patio doors open on your room or your air conditioner.

My mother and I stayed at this resort for a week and had probably the best vacation we've ever had. We flew Transat and yes it's not the greatest but they fed us a hot meal and the flight crew are very helpful and accomodating. When we pulled up on the resort I don't think I could contain myself. It's set in very lush grounds surrounded by a golfcourse, makes for great photo ops. The lobby is small and cute, very Mexican style. That seems to be the running theme at the Lupita, everything is very Mexican. You're not going to see huge fountains, pillars, and statues like at some of the other Riu resorts. But come on this IS Mexico after all! The food was very good, always lots to choose from. Staff was alwasy replenishing the trays in the buffet. Waiters were very kind and made an effort to speak in every language they came across. Drinks were topped up promptly and plates taken away as well. The deserts are to DIE for. One night they had a chocolate fountain which was nice. All the staff were wonderful. The animation staff are just crazy and fun, Geraldo is a riot! There is a lot of different nationalities and yes some are hard to deal with but such is life! I mostly spent my pool time at the 'quiet' pool but both are nice and you can see staff cleaning them every morning. The shuttle to the beach club is always on time. I actually enjoyed it as you got to see lots of people on the drive and the convenience of being dropped right at Playa was wonderful. One staff member was telling me it's only 500 metres from the beach but as it's set in a golf course you can't cut through. The beach club was nice. They had a good selection of food... I took a big plate of chips down to my lounger. They only have beer here as their is no bar, but not a problem for me. The beach itself had lots of chairs and was never crowded at all like the areas on either side of us. They have put up a kind of wall/fence and some areas are kind of rocky. Take the steps down on the Riu Palace side to the left, if you go on the other side you kind of have to climb. I think the beaches in this area have not fully recovered from the Hurricane.. the sand feels kind of different. Almost like there's ground coral or something. But the water is amazing, the sun is hot so no complaints. We did go down to the Riu Playacar and spent a day at their beach and pool which was nice but much more crowded. I liked the Lupita as it gave you all the glitz Riu is knownn for but then you go back to the Lupita and feel totally at home. We took a day over on Cozumel which was really quite fun. I loved Margaritaville as it had a great view and it's own swimming area with water trampolines and snorkels. We also spent a day at Xcaret which was amazing, lots of wildlife and their evening show is wonderful.

Some of them were really flirty. Nevertheless, they really took care of you when you ate. One time, me and my sister came in within the closing minutes of the restaurant one night. We noticed that all of our favourite foods were gone so the restaurant manager actually went out of his way to get the food freshly made for us. I was so impressed. I also really liked the entertainment staff. They were so friendly and interactive. You could tell that they worked really hard at their job but they love it. Being one of the very few Canadians at the resort, we got a lot of attention at the resort. I enjoyed the activities that were coordinated by the entertainment staff, particularly wateraerobics and beach volleyball. The maid service was also decent. They left a lot of towel art and flowers on our beds which was kind of neat. I also enjoyed 5th avenue, which is basically a shopping area in Playa del Carmen. The local vendors were very forward with you. If you ever want to feel good about yourself, just go to 5th avenue. I think the only downside to the hotel was the fact that it wasn't close to the beach. That's the only thing that I would complain about. But other than that, the service was excellent! I loved the night shows, particularly Casino night. I enjoyed the laid-back, carefree and easy-going kind of atmosphere at the resort. There were a lot of families with young children, which is another thing that I didn't like as much. It would have been better if there was more representation from Canada but the majority of people who stayed at the resort were from France.

I think this hotel was good for the money I paid 140 US per night for two adults and two children. This hotel caters mostly to the French and the spanish speaking people.I'm mexican/american so could't really felt left out.With exception that some of my fellow Mexican sisters were sometimes rude and greedy. When we wanted to go see the entertainment show one lady was holding ten seats. I asked if I could use one, and she very rudly said no. Also when we were waiting for the bus, there was an elderly couple and a French couple, waiting with us, then came about seven Mexican ladies. When the bus finally came, one of the ladies manage to cut off on the elderly couple and put bags in each seat that was still empty, did not feel bothered at all that the couple was older and needed the seats more than she did. No one offer the seats to elderly ,not the French not Spanish. What brings me to the French, This was the last bus, and a French man told the bus driver to leave the rest of the people there, even though it was still some space for them. French people claim not to like Americans because we are greedy , thanks to our president. As individuals I wonder who are the greedy ones. Not all the French are rude ,there was some nice ones. My daughter made friends with a nice little french girl, mom seem nice too, some younger French guys were nice too even knew some spanish. ok lets get to the review. FOOD : good for breakfast , I had omelets and chilaquiles (maxican dish) almost every day, my kids had pancakes and bacon and my husband tried different things.We only had lunch there one time, it was not good, I only had fruit and some dessert ,my son was really disapointed, they had hot dogs, pizza, and hamburgers and a couple of mexican dishes which were not good , Im mexican and I know mexican food I was not impress with mexican food in all Quintana Roo or Yucatan.There's better mexican restaurants in Chicago. We left with our emty stomach that day. I suggest, go to Riu Tequila for lunch,it's like dinner at the Lupita. a lot of variety . Dinner was ok. SERVICE: It was great at the bars. Good at restaurants. And not so great at the front desk. When we arrived at the Lupita we were tired from a trip we made to Chichen Itza, Valladoli and Ek Balam . I told them my name and it checked out in the system, an ID should had been enough, but they decided to make me look for the confirmation paper back at the car. Then they sent us to look for our room . We had a hard time finding our room in the dark and my children didn't help either and to top it off we were pulling our luggage. The following day my husband notice there was Bell boy service, he was highly upset, he thought it was not offer to us because we are hispanic. That wasn't the case, it was just bad customer service the same thing happen to a couple from England. They were lost and pulling their luggage , I had to call the front desk for them. I would suggest to the Riu Lupita that they offer this service to everyone at all times. The service at bar was always great they even prepared drinks for us, they weren't familiar with. At the buffet we had different service every day sometime great ,sometimes ok .Some of the waiters go out of their way to serve you drinks, We sometimes tipped for great service. Unfurtunatly when we got to this resort we had spent more than we expected and didn't have much money left. If you can tip 20 pesos or a dollar it's very well appreciated. BEACH: There was really no beach, not that we care. We had enough beach the previous week. ROOM: rooms are basic. A lot of people complain of beds being hard . Ok , we are use to sleeping on a Beautyrest Plush. when we got to our room tired from a long day, we could not tell the difference. I want to comment on a previous review posted. This person said this hotel was horrible because sheets weren't change everyday,.and that North americans had higher standards than French, Spanish people did.Honestly I don't change my sheets everyday, oh, maybe thats because Im Mexican/American and not totally American.I've been in resorts in the US and get charge twice as much. Rooms are basically the same with no beer or sodas or anything maybe some coffee and waterslides.You get no food,icecream ,dessert , drinks nothing and what they sell, it's so overprice, but they do change the sheets everyday. When we got to the Lupita, sheets and blankets were very clean. The blankets are better than some American resorts. I just wished the the towels looked as white as the sheets. I did not spend much time in the resort so can really tell you more.During my two week stay in Riviera Maya we made alot of trips. We did Tulum Ruins, Chichen Itza, Ek Balam, Pirate Asult,, Cancun, Akumal, Xcaret,Valladoli, Paraiso beach in Tulum, In my opinion this is the most beutiful beach in Quintana Roo. We took a boat trip to Isla Mujeres and learned how snorkel before learnig how to swim, it was like being in a fish tank filled with different color fishes.We went to Xel-ha and didn't find it the same but would recomend it, and we also did parasailing in Cancun. It was great. I'll be posting reviews for all these trips and pics too. If you have any questions feel free to ask . We also did Yal ku. I would stay in this hotel for the right price. We chose this resort over the tequila because of the price, it was 300US cheeper per week.I rather have some money left to do different trips,Than stay stuck in a palace with no money left. Honestly I dont understand why people come to a different country to stay in their resort all day . In that case I would stay in one close to home and save me the plane tickets. I think for the money it was above average with some problems.", "Date": "June 27, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "3", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "B.C.Canada", "Title": "\u201c2 Great Weeks\u201d", "Author": "JoLee", "ReviewID": "UR7846487", "Content": "Just returned from our 2 weeks vacation to Lupita. I e-mailed a request for room and on arrival our room was Just as requested, 2nd floor,with View of quiet pool. A1 . It was clean and kept this way for 2 weeks. We tipped ,plus a small gift each day and had clean towels,stocked bar,cool room, towel animals on bed each day, A1. One day the lamp was broken, a call to desk and an electrician fixed the broken-off bulb and short-out right away. We requested a type of liquor not supplied in the room bar, and maybe because we tipped the bartenders often and have been to another Riu before, a bottle appeared with a note from the bar manager. NICE. I used the Internet, if you have a RIU card you get 2 hour's for the price of one hour. We enjoyed both pools and animation activities.Darts,Horseshoes ,Bocci Ball. Hubby won lots of certificates. We enjoyed the shows: Mariachi,Broadway,LasVegas,Maya Night, Caribeno and Folklore, very well done by the RIU Dancers. also enjoyed Casino night,by the animacion team. Did NOT go to the Mexican restaurant, enjoyed the Buffet, so many choices.From Tuna Steak to Pecan Pie ,what more do you Need? We gave the bus driver a tip each day and enjoyed the drive to the Beach Area and back. It runs from 7.30 to 6.45p.m. He dropped us off @ circle only 2 blks. from 5th ave.and dock to Cozumel 2 days. We love Playa del Carmen town,and even went to Walmart(now that's funny) We went to the BEACH at the RIU Playacar and RIU Yucatan,also used their Pools and Restaurants and Bars.,Plenty to do,you need 2 weeks!! I think I enjoyed Playacar a little better as it isn't as buzy. I went on a tour of the RIU Palace Mexico- Darn Nice place, but I did notice a very musty smell in the room, more so than at any other resort we have been too. I went on a Kitchen tour or the RIU Yucatan, very clean and impressed watching the girls do cake decorations. We even checked out the Tequila. It's so nice to be able to go to the other 4 RIU resorts Plus the Lupita. Did NOT to to Disco, but noise woke me up at 1 a.m. once. I mentioned this, just as a joke to the Animation Boss, His reply was \"he would have to SEE to it\". No more Late Night Music !!- they must have kept the doors shut I guess- GOOD !! I read about the \"Birds\" on a previous review and it's true, Birds KNOW when the food is put out at the Snack Bar! \"Get it BEFORE they do\"!!. Darn I forgot to write it on the Comment sheet that Riu passes out on your stay,as I feel some action should be taken there,as I have never noticed them to be so troublesome at other Resorts. lol We talked to lots of nice people, from Loads and loads of countries,from Mexico to Chile.

This was my family's first experience with the Riu hotels (2 young boys - ages 6 & 7), truly a great experience. The food at the resort was fantastic. There is 2 restaurant (a l'carte and buffet). The buffet provided enough variety to satisfy all. The kids did not enjoy the a l'carte as much. They like the buffet alot more since they were able to pick what they wanted to eat. Before booking my trip I did check TripAdvisor. I noticed alot of reviews indicated 'rude French people'. Surprise, surprise there were alot of 'rude French people' at this resort. Your best bet is to avoid them as much as possible. I would say 35% - 50% of the resort was made up of French, 25% Spanish and the rest German, Dutch, and English(US & Canadian). The entertainment was good. Enjoyed the Mayan dancers. The hotel indicated it had a Kids Club but there was no one there attending to the activities for kids. Our kids played in the kids pool for an hour and wanted to go to the activity pool since that is where all the action was. The animators would come daily to ask the adults to join in the activities but children were not allowed to join in. The activities were horseshoe, Bachi Ball, Ping Pong, Aqua Aerobics ,darts and BINGO. They did not want the kids involved in fear of the kids getting hurt. Trying to occupy our kids day activities was difficult since they were not allowed to join in. I would not recommend this resort if you have small children. They would be bored out of their minds. Luckily, I brought a card game and utilized the pools volleyball.

I wanted an unpretentious place to relax for one week and that was also easy to travel out from to do interesting things. A woman travelling alone, I also wanted a place where I would feel safe. It was perfect. Thanks to everyone that contributed reviews! The resort is intimate with pleasant gardens, very friendly and helpful staff, one pool where you can join in lots of lively activities, and another nearby behind some of the bungalows that is quiet for those that want that. While I was there, I would say that there were equal Spanish-speaking guests to French, a small contingent of Canadians, and some German and Dutch guests. I had two simply excellent therapeutic massages by Roussel in the Spa. Having been a massage therapist myself for many years, I can tell you that you can get different but not better. My second floor room in one of the bungalows was comfortable, always clean and overlooked the golf course. When I arrived, my safe was not closing properly; someone came and fixed it within five minutes. I found the food to be just fine: fresh, plenty of variety and nicely presented. As I prefer a mostly vegetarian diet with some fish, chicken, cheese and eggs, it was easy to eat well here. I don't usually eat desserts but here, there were so many delicious little \"postres\", that it was easy to indulge! The shuttle bus runs on time and makes it convenient to go into Playa del Carmen or to the Beach Club and the other RIU hotels that Lupita guests have access to. I only had time to try the RIU Tequila one day for lunch. It was excellent, again lovely gardens and a restaurant beside an ample and attractive swimming pool. Next time, I want to try the beach at the Yucatan. The Lupita beach area is a little rocky but still a pleasant place to lie under the palm trees, enjoy the ocean air and gaze out over azure water. The restaurant served the same quality of food as at the hotel. Being an adventurous sort, and a photographer, I hired a driver tor one day to take me to Chichen Itza, Ik Kil and Cho-Ha cenotes and to Coba - fascinating. Another day, I spent most of it in the Xaman-Ha Aviario in Playacar...only minutes from the Lupita. The aviary is a little paradise. I highly recommend a visit there. Being nearby, I wandered into Playa del Carmen for the evening and had a wonderful meal at Media Luna restaurant (this name came up when I researched my trip on the Internet before I left as being highly recommended) - tomato, avocado, mango and grilled shrimp salad to die for. Was something like $12. I took a ferry from Playa del Carmen over to Cozumel for a day. The ferry is only $22.50 return. Again, I ended up hiring a driver for four hours to take me around the island to visit the Mayan ruins at San Gervasio, see the \"wild\" side of Cozumel with its miles of sandy beaches and crashing waves, swim at one of the beautiful public beaches and tour the town of San Miguel. I also spent a day at Xcaret eco-park. Loved it! Very imaginatively designed, swam with dolphins, was entranced by butterflies in the exquisite butterfly garden, photographed orchids in the orchid greenhouse and caught the fabulous nighttime show...worth the price of admission just for this. Lots more to see but one needs two days. I definitely hope to go back again!

This is our first experience with Riu but not the first in the Caribbean and we didn't like it at all. At least at this resort. We like to travel in 4-5 star resorts on our vacations and do not expect a royal treament at all. We got a good deal for Riu Lupita which is a 4 star but considering all the services they cut, I would had consider an extra few hundred bucks to be in a better one. Beware of the cheap price cause it's not worth it if you want to have decent vacation. CONS: They did not change our sheets for the whole week even if we left a tip everyday, reused the towels that we dropped in the shower floor as they instructed in the case that we want them to be changed. We now understand why there are so few reviews for this place on this website, not a lot of of people from Canada or United States, you will find a lot of Europeans and Mexicans which I guess the standards of life are different than North Americans'. The food are the same every single day throughout the week from breakfast to dinner. I had food poisoning with the food at the snack bar so did my son. No variety, no theme buffet as they indicate (supposedly twice a week). Only one mexican \u00e0 la carte restaurant and no exchange privilege for dinner at the other 3 Riu (Yucatan, Tequila or Playacar). The bus service stopped at dinner so if you want to spend the evening at one of the other 3 resort to enjoy the real evening shows by professionnal troups (cause the ones at Lupita are mainly done by the animation team), you have to pay a 5$ taxi each way. They are supposed to refill the fridge every other day but did it only twice in our room (even with a tip) . We are not big drinkers so we mostly used the bottles of water and few sodas a day. We called at the reception to inform them that the fridge wasn't refill and we need 2 bottles of water, they told us that there is no room service and we have to pick it up at the bar. We went and the bar ran out of bottles. We had to manage for 2 days with a half of bottle (necessary for brushing teeth or drink since the water is not potable). We are not the kind of people that like to make a big fuss and since we already know that we would never come back to this place so we didn't make any another complaint. But we do expect some decent services that we paid for and promised. PROS: This resort is in Playacar area so very close to Playa del Carmen and the beach which make your stay more enjoyable. The security is very enhanced. Staff are nice and smiling. The animation team does a great job in the day for the activities.

My wife and I are beach lovers so we did not spend anytime at the resort during the day.

Also, at the Riu Lupita, a lot of people had complaints about their showers running cold water all the time. We figured out the solution to this- run your bathroom sink water at the same time as the shower and it becomes HOT! That's my one good tip for you to be comfortable at the resort.

We paid about $1,400 for the week for both of us so I have no idea how the Canadians were getting in at $700 per week. FOOD: I thought the buffet was OK but my wife thought it was very good. Although the breakfast buffet was the same everyday, it was plentiful and had a large variety that I liked. I liked their coffee with hot milk and their fruit and vegetable smoothie drinks. My wife particularly liked the fresh cooked doughnuts. One night they made an excellent shrimp ceviche and the next night is wasn't very good. We could pick out the plentiful French people because they had to put their breads in a cute little basket. We only had a few minor French incidents when I was using the capacino machine and a French woman comes up to use the other side of the machine. Oblivious to me she started pushing buttons and cancelled my capacino half way through the process. After she left I started over. The dinner restaurant that required a reservation was very good and hot. My main complaint with the buffets is that the food is luke warm. We had a rental car and never had a lunch buffet at the Lupita since we would use the Playacar or Yucatan buffets or be in Chichen Itza for the day. The Playacar lunch buffet seemed to be the best and the Yucatan was a disappointment. We spent most of our days at the Yucatan so that I could take wind surfing lessons. After an hour into the lesson the instructor, Carlos, offered to refund all of my money because I was so bad at it. We did try the dinner buffet at the Tequila and saw that it was an improvement over Lupita. Yes, you must try the Mayan coffee as suggested from prior reviews. The drinks seemed plentiful and had the right amount of alcohol. Entertainment: Some of the nightly shows were excellent and others were OK. We observed only 3 shows and one was a karaoke night which seemed like an easy filler night for the staff. Transportation: If you arrive in Cancun in the afternoon, like 3 pm, then you will not get to the resort until about 7 pm. It took about 2 hours to get through Mexcan customs and another hour to get my reserved rental car. My plan to not drive at night did not work. The main fear is hitting the people along the side of the road. There are not any good road maps to the resort and I only relied on the aerial view from Google Earth which made it interesting at night. My main reason for getting a rental car was to avoid getting hosed by the Taxis drivers from Cancun airport who seem to charge what they feel like depending the quality of the resort that you're staying at. The Alamo rate was $15 per day plus $17 per day for Mexican insurance which was more insurance than I really needed. You learn the Mexican way of driving pretty quick and learn to watch for major speed bumps that appear out of nowhere. The rental gave us the flexibility of driving to the other Riu resorts at anytime and allowed us to drive to Xecaret, Tulum, and Chichen Itza.

When my husband and I arrived (we were the only ones dropped off at this resort) we thought it was a little small, but do-able. This was our 2nd trip to Mexico. Our room no# was 3130. Pretty good room overlooking the small, but quiet pool. Rooms are simple but decent. I checked the hot water right away as I had read that there may not be any, and there was, so I was satisfied, (we hadn't intended to stay in the room much anyway)We didn't really experience much \"rudeness from the French people\" as I assumed we would from the posts on this site, but the resort is approx 90% French people, 3% Italian, 5% other europeans and 2 % english speaking. The french people never smile and say hello, in fact they pretend they don't see you at all. Don't expect to mingle or party at this place, because it just doesn\"t happen. Went to the disco the 1st night and partyed by ourselves (mabey 6-8 other people in the place) The food is not very good there. The breakfast is not bad, but when it came time for lunch, it was leftovers from breakfast turned into mixmash for lunch and then lunch leftovers mixed into mixmash for dinner. Yuck! We were looking forward to the great salsa and guacamole but it was tasteless. There is a mexican restaurant that you can make reservations at. We never made it there, because, guess what? i was stricken with the worst case of food poisoning that you imagine in the middle of the night on our 2nd night. My huband was a little luckier than myself, it didn't hit him for another day later. We spent the next 2 days in our room fighting for the bathroom. Eventually we did go to the other riu's (yucatan and tequilla). They are alot bigger and much nicer. The beach there is beautiful and taking the bus wasn't so bad. The food buffets there consist of the same food as the Lupita, but much bigger. We never did make it to the other restaurants at the other Riu's, but they looked beautiful. As for the staff at the Lupita, they were very friendly and the place was kept very clean at all times. Do not leave a drink on your counter in your room because within an hour you will see tiny little ants surrounding the glass. There were these tiny ants that would be in the corners of the room constantly, however I didn't complain, because I was more concerned with my stomach and the staff cleaned the room each day. We tipped at the end of our stay only and the room was cleaned everyday and floors were mopped. There is 1 bar at the main pool area, which gets fairly busy at night, but like I said before, unless your French, don't expect any mingling. Bartenders are very friendly and quick. Its best to order your drinks as doubles, cause they are samll and a little weak otherwise, There is a bar in your room and a bar fridge ithe Coronas, pepsi, orange pop and 7UP. There is always bottled water there too. Use this water to brush your teethm don't take any chances. We went shopping in Play de Carmen. Picture 8 shops, which repeat themselves over and over, with restaurants and small hotels between them. Good place to see (once). The public beach there looks nice. I got a (very poorly done) henna tattoo in that town for 20 bucks US. The guy spelled everything wrong and tried to fix it twice.Good thing it was high on the side of my leg, and not exposed on my arm. I paid the guy and my husband laughed at the tattoo saying our daughter could have done it better with a felt pen. We then went on with our shopping and purchase 2 tickets for a tour to chichen inza for the next day. Do Not buy any tours from vendors on 5th Avenue(the main shopping strip in Playa deCarmen) They are evrywhere. Turns out we were ripped off and after waiting the next day, to go on our tour.........nobody came. When we called the no# on our receipt, the guy appologized and said they forgot to pick us up but would be there the next morning at 7AM. Needless to say, he never came. We ended up paying $150.00 US for a private driver and another $18.00 entrance fee for a tour the next day. We did go back to town to demand our money back, but the staff at the place said the guy only worked there for 2 days blah blah blah.In a nutshell, we had been taken. We wnet to COCO Bongos nightclub in Cancun one night. Interesting show and club. Mostly a show, not alot of getting to dance, which is hard when your pinned amongs a thousand or so other people the entire time.I would recommend getting a ride to Cancun and strolling all the bars. The streets and outsides of nightclubs are something to see. I wish we would have gone into the club called \"The City\", but we had already spent $130.00 on our 2 tickets which included transpotation, entrance and open bar. There were very few children staying at the Lupita and those that were there were 5 and under. There were many more at the other Riu's. Also if you have children, you may like to know that there is topless tanning at the Riu Lupita (also at the beach)My husband says the only requirement for this is that you be a female OVER the age of 50. Its not too attractive. Also, for you men........bring the samllest speedos you can find because that is the dress code by the pools. As for the nightly entertainment, the staff tries really hard to put on a different show each night and I give them a \"A\" for there effort. We paid approx $1300.00 canadian per person for our one week and I thonk it was way too much for the Riu Lupita. Stay at the Yucatan instead.Because of the food and illness which continued to plague us for the remainder of this trip, I would not recommend the Riu Lupita. If you want to keep to yourselves and lay by a pool by day, room by 10PM, this could be a place for you. I would have to guess the average age in this resort to be 55 .

I did my best to avoid them which was easily done as they don't mingle with you. Some of the other guests had an option to upgrade to the Yucatan, but chose not to.

The resort is a small one that is off the beach. We were already aware of that and it didn't cause us any problems. The hotel shuttle is very efficient. You can use three other Riu's in the area. The Riu Playacar, Riu Yucatan and the Riu Tequila. I visited all three and speant some time at each. FOOD The food at the Lupita was bland. I understand that they have to cook for a large group of people with varying tastes, however it all tasted like paper to me. There was plenty of food. The fruit was always freah and kept me going. We eventually went out to Playa del Carmen to eat. If you get a chance try Babes Noodles on 10th. After about four days of bland the taste explosion was extreme. SERVICE Outstanding!!! It is smaller than the other Riu's and I feel have much better service. It is small enough to still have the Hacienda type feel. I never had to wait for a drink at the bar or for assistance at any of the restaurants. The maid service again outstanding. Always clean and the small details were not overlooked by our maid. I did hear people complain, but I am not sure what there issues were. ROOM We stayed in room 3121. It was on the second floor with a vaulted ceiling. It was a great room and we were very comfortable. POOLS There were two pools we used at the Riu. The larger of the two had activities going on all the time. I did not take part and they were not forceful in getting participants. The other pool was a quiet pool that was mainly for relaxing. The pools were clean and just fine. ENTERTAINMENT I watched a couple of the shows. The animation team really try hard. I had a few laughs. OTHER GUESTS How do I put this delicately. There are very many different cultures at the Lupita as apposed to the other Riu's in the area. I found the french to be pushy and that hey have no concept of lines or waiting your turn. I am assuming it is just a cultural thing. We once went early to get a good table in the bar to watch the show. About a third of the way through the show a family from france walk up directly in front of us and stood there and watched the show until they observed my displeasure. Not much consideration. There was a large group of Canadians. They were having a blast and I am sure they drank the bar dry. Good people that i only met on the plane home. I wish I would have met them earlier. VALUE I was able to get this resort at $508.00 plus tax. It was really worth that price. My suggestion is to watch the sell offs and book when you are comfortable paying what you see. Overall we had a good vacation. We did many day trips to Xel-Ha , Tulum, Cozumel, 5th Ave and Coba.

Been at several Riu hotels in Cancun but wanted to try something different. We knew this Riu was not on the beach which was fine. We ended up going to the Riu Yucatan's beach almost everyday. It had the best beach in Playa of all the Riu Hotels. Its a 30min walk thru some nice neighborhoods to the Riu Yucatan or take the free Riu bus to the Riu Lupita Beach club. Its a 15min walk from the Riu Lupita beach club to the Yucatan. The Riu Club Tequila Beach club is also next to the Riu Yucatan. The best of both worlds. We didn't find the Riu Lupita beach club very inviting...no beach to speak of. The Riu Lupita was average as far as the room ,food etc. The staff was excellent as other posters have mentioned. The nightly entertainment was actually much better than I expected. The Mayan show is not to be missed !!!! Yes, very few english speaking folks at the Lupita but who cares. And Yes the french were very rude in the food lines, i guess manners are a bit lacking in France. Still that wasn't a big deal. The up side to the french at the hotel was they were not shy about going topless around the Lupita pool :) Downtown Playa and Cozumel are great. There must be 100 restaurants in downtown Playa and we found some good ones. The biggest problem with our 2 weeks in Playa was it rained all but 2 days....a bummer....and I mean it rained for most of the day all 10 days. We ended up exploring all the other Riu's in Playa and finding the best beaches for our trip back next year. We would consider staying at the Lupita again because it was very quite at night and staff was great. A better option might be to stay at the Riu Yucatan or Club Riu Tequila (Its across the street from the beach) The Riu Yucatan baeach was outstanding !!! You can walk about 10 min south along the beach in front of the Yucatan and find a stretch of beach with no hotels, no nothing... PS - Please pet the white cat in the restaurant.

My wife is French, I am Dutch and we live in Spain. We initially did not want to book the Lupita as we had seen some negative comments on this site. However with hindsight it was the best thing that happened to us. We paid about 3200 euros for a one week trip to the Lupita including flights from Spain. Would we have booked one of the other Riu\u00b4s this would have been 1000 euros more. The hotel is great for a family with kids, service is excelent, rooms are simple. The shuttle to the beach is efficient. However if you want to really enjoy the beach go to Playacar and not to the Lupita beach club as the beach is very small. There where lot\u00b4s of Canadians and French. We have not noticed any unpolite behavior from any of the guests and where happy that the Lupita was less of a \u00b4Tattoolandia\u00b4 than some of the other Riu hotels with a high percentage of US visitors of a certain level. Also the food at the lupita was better then for example at Playacar which was very oriented to a US clientele. Stay at the Lupita, have a mixed audience, use the other hotels at your convenience and pay a lower price. The animation staff was very polite and active and never pushy.

The hotel was nice, but truly the best part is the staff who are just great. From the moment we checked in and were greeted with a welcome drink to the efficient checkout and everything in between, the staff exceeded expectations. They put on a wonderful New Year's eve celebration and worked throughout the week to get everyone involved in their activities. The rooms were fine, each has a small deck which was a nice place to sit and relax. Each room had a mini fridge and liquor dispensor which was also nice. The fact that the hotel is not on the beach is probably the biggest negative but the shuttle run is very efficient and always ran on time. The beach club is quiet which was fine with me but my daughter and friend enjoyed the beach at the Riu Playacar where they found all the water activities they wanted. This is just a short walk from the beach club. The shuttle will also drop you off at the entrance to the town which is nice although it is only a $5 cab ride into town. When I read previous reviews about this hotel one thing that was mentioned was the other guests, many from France which bothered some of the posters. I thought that was strange as the reason for traveling was to encounter new people but having spent the week with a hotel almost 3/4 filled with a large group from France I have to agree with previous reviewers. These are not freindly people. They are in fact rude even accounting for what may be in part cultural differences. No one waits in line and at the restaurant I encountered other guests with really awful practices like using their hands to sort through food items. All in all we had a great week, the weather was perfect and the town of Playa del Carmen offers much.

I can understand their position, but it did make for a really bad start to our vacation. The hotel states a dress code for dinner, but don't worry, it is not enforced. If men want to wear shorts for dinner, it is allowed. I would not have packed as many \"dinner clothes\" had I known this. Speaking of dinner, I found the food to be just \"ok\", and it really didn't matter because by the 4th day of our vacation I became extremely ill. I ate nothing for the next day and a half, and recovered in time to watch my husband become ill.

My wife and I are recently retired (late 50's) so we did not go to rock climb or do challenging activity When you arrive at the airport, everyone seems 'official'. Be very careful. We were heading for a pre-arranged transfer (Sunquest) to the hotel and we were directed to a counter of 'uniformed' agents. After 5 minutes, I realized that we were being coerced into attending time share presentation(s). Fortunately, our transportation was still available when we got outside. The front desk at the Riu Lupita greeted us in a very friendly and considerate manner. The fact that we were the only couple arriving that day (Monday) meant that we had their undivided attention, so it may have been different if we had been part of a large crowd Our room was nice. King size bed and a quiet view out the window. (Room 1916). If you have any physical incapacities, note that some of the rooms are on 2nd and 3rd floors, with outside stairs, only. Housekeeping was good. Specially-designed towel creatures were left, each day. I never turned on the cold water tap, if I needed warm to hot water. The shower never was warmer than just warm and often was quite cool..........with only the hot water tap on. Only one bar on the site. They advertise 2, but the disco is only available between 11 pm and 2 am. It is a very small room which offered no interest to me. The one bar is well staffed and it was not too difficult to get any type of beverage. The bar staff were very friendly. Meals are buffet style. I found the made to order omelets were my favorite for breakfast. Lots of bacon and sausage, if you wish. Pancakes and French toast were made at a station I did miss my hot cereal, though. The hotel is quite small and has a very small (but wonderfully clean) kitchen..........take the tour, if you can.........it showed their concern for cleanliness.. I did not find that the selections for lunch and dinner were extremely varied. There was a pasta station that cooked your order on site. There was a station that mixed up seafood 'gumbo' The rains clearly showed the weakness of thatched roof construction. Buckets and mats were ever-present. Some staff did nothing but mop. The tiled floor was quite slippery. The one a la carte restaurant was Mexican. Very few people went to the early sitting. We never booked a meal, there, so I can not attest to the food quality. I believ it was a 'set menu' meal. The pool was OK. It is small in comparison with other hotels in the area. There is one very small pool, near the disco, which offers seclusion from the activities and music. The pool is clean. The water is quite cold. The depth of the pool is a constant 3 feet. Because the hotel is inland, quite a few people leave for the day and either go to Playa del Carmen or the other Rius that we can use (Playacar, Tequila, Yucatan). The shuttle was always on time and ran on a half hour schedule up to 6:30 p.m. If you needed a cab, it was about a $5 local fare. We had rain all week, so, needless to say, chairs around the pool were readily available. The animacion team was very courteous and tried to get people involved in rifle shooting, pool tournaments, bingo, water aerobics, and other activities. They were excellent at remembering your name and often stopped to chat with us. There was no pressure to participate. The evening shows were amateurish, but lots of energy and quite a variety from night to night. They usually had a music group starting around 8 and some specific entertainment from 9:30 to 10:30 (aqpproximately) The other Rius were quite nice and had big pools and multiple bars. You could spend all day there if you wanted. The beach at Yucatan was quite nice. One thing to be aware of.............those people who have written that you can walk down the long laneway to the beach club and then take the beach to the various Riu hotels are mistaken (now). The locals tell me that high tide at this beach is by season, not by hours. This time of year, there is NO BEACH from the Riu Lupita Beach club to the Riu Playacar or Yucatan. Take the roadway, after the shuttle drops you off. Walk to Riu Playacar or Yucatan. The last note that I will leave is that the hotel obviously has great coverage by travel agents in Europe (especially France). We were 2 of 6 people from Canada. There was one extended family from the USA. the remainder were mostly French, some German, Spanish, Dutch, Scandinavian. We noticed that the other Rius had a much larger contingent of English-speaking patrons. Most of the Riu Lupita animacion team can speak English (but not as first language). The dining staff have very limited English. We did find it somewhat disconcerting always having to use charades or pseudo Spanish to try to explain ourselves.

We arrived in Cancun Airport and saw a sign with 'RIU' on it being held by a man. We approached the man and asked about transportation to our hotel. I had done research before our trip so that I would know the going rates. The rates are about $45 (American) for a cab ride about $18 for a group shuttle and $5 on public bus. I asked the Riu representative and he told me $85 for a cab, $65 for a group shuttle and the public bus was not available for anyone but locals and that they would check my ID. We walked away and walked down to where the shuttles were and bought 2 tickets for $18 each. We arrived at the Riu Lupita for the beginning of our honeymoon. We had noted that this would be our honeymoon when we booked our stay through Orbitz as \"Honeymoon Special\" We were given our room and when we got to it it was not decorated for a honeymoon and it had 2 double beds. We took our luggage back to the desk and requested a room with one king bed and for it to be made up for a honeymoon. We were given another room. It did have a king bed but was not made up for our special event. The next morning I went to the front desk to reserve a tee time. (When we made our decision on which hotel to stay at we chose yours because on the Internet it showcases a world class golf course that the Riu Lupita sits right next to. We love golf.) I was informed that it was a private course and we could not play on it. I went back to the room to find water on the floor, we put a towel down. We took showers and prepared for our day. We were about to leave when we noticed the water was getting worse. I went to put our things into the safe and there was no lock on the safe. We were going to need another room. We went down to the front desk and requested another room. He insisted as he handed me a slip in lock for the safe that we did not require another room and that he would have to send up maintenance. We walked back to our room and awaited maintenance. They arrived and confirmed that there was a broken pipe which was rushing water into our room. They gave us another room, however it was not ready now, it would be ready at noon. I requested again that our room be made up for our honeymoon. We had breakfast and then took the shuttle down to the beach club. We spent a nice afternoon there. We had snacks and I tried some seafood soup and noted it was a little fishy smelling. We arrived back at the hotel at 3pm and were informed that our room still was not ready. We were very disappointed and told them so. I asked if the general manager was in and they said 'no'. When we did get to our room about 10 minutes later it still was not made up as a \"Honeymoon Special\". We decided to go out for dinner. Unfortunately I never got to eat my dinner as food poisoning was setting in. The only thing I ate that day that my husband did not was the seafood soup at the beach club. We had to rush me home where I spent the rest of the evening in the ladies room. Wednesday we wake up to spend our last full day in Mexico. There is no hot water. I let it run for about 10 and then I call the front desk they say let it run 5 minutes more and then call back. I do and I call back, they say they will send up a technician. I went down to the front desk and asked to speak to the General Manager. The man calls him on the walkie talkie and there is no answer. He asks if I would like for him to tell him I would like to speak with him. I tell him no because he hadn't told him on Monday when I asked to speak with him. I opted to wait. about 20-25 minutes go by and I asked if they would please try to contact him again. I was then informed that he had left 20 minutes ago and that they would have him call us. I told him that we were scheduled for a nine o'clock dinner and we could be contacted then. We had waited 30 minutes, no technician we decide that we can go to the beach without showers. We arrive back at the hotel that evening and go to our rooms to change. There is a fruit plate and a bottle of tequila (\"Honeymoon Special\"?) We do have hot water and we shower and dress for dinner. 8:45pm the GM calls and assures us he will do everything to make the rest of our trip a swinging success. We went to dinner and then to bed. We woke up in the morning had breakfast & went to town for some souvenirs. We arrived at the front desk at 12pm for check out and asked for them to call us a cab. There was a gentleman getting a tee time reservation for 4 [He did not know the prices (which members don't pay) we gathered that he was not a member]. We never heard from that manager or any other. Our cab came quickly and we went to the airport. p.s We were on honeymoon and proceeded to have a great time. This hotel however greatly tested our dedication to happiness.

Our flight was direct from LA on Mexicana. If you are going to Cancun or Playa Del Carmen, our hotel was a good deal. The RIU Lupita itself was clean, and seemed very secure. We went through one guard gate to get into the Playacar area, and another to get onto the hotel grounds. If you had a hotel wristband, you could get free food, drink, activities, etc. The employees were nice, but we were surprised that this seemed to be a better opportunity to practice our french than spanish. For reasons which eluded us, most of the guests spoke french. Being all-inclusive, the minibar was free. There was also an unusual liquor dispenser, consisting of upside-down tequila and vodka bottles with taps mounted against the wall. We had an in-room safe. Nice, except that we had brought a laptop which didn't fit. Our room had a problem with the toilet, which sometimes kept running unless you jiggled the handle. The maid service was very good. There was a rabbit made out of washcloths waiting when we arrived. After housekeeping saw that we had brought stuffed animals of our own, they made a towel elephant for to keep them company. Pretty cool, and not something you get at the Hyatt. The bartenders were good, and it was very relaxed. No tabs, room numbers, tip calculations, or other hassles. Well, maybe one hassle for people from the US. Smoking is allowed at the bar. Still, the bar only has a roof and no walls, so it's not too smokey. If you go, make sure to order a Mayan Coffee. Bartender Ambrosio introduced us to this very tasty and visually prepared drink. Flaming anise is poured from one vessel to another from overhead, and then into your drink. Don't try this at home, but have one or two at the RIU. There were a number of activities to choose from. When you read the fine print, many are free, but some cost extra. Snorkeling and catamaran were free. Scuba and motorized watersports cost extra. RIU Lupita is not on the water, but has a shuttle to take you to its beach club, or to a second stop near the shopping areas in Playacar. Several RIU hotels are close together, and you can use many services and activities at the others. The menus are different, and it's easy to have breakfast or lunch at a different hotel. Keeping track of what you could do where was a bit of a problem. I also have some comments about the area in general. There are good and bad things about Cancun and Playa Del Carmen. Good about the area: 1. Sunny, warm. Even in November it's comfortable to snorkel or Catamaran. 2. The locals are generally very happy and pleasant. 3. Food and drink are pretty reasonable. 4. You can get by speaking only english, you can speak spanish. In many places you can speak french. 5. You can spend pesos or dollars; both of them are accepted most places. Bad about the area: 1. Prepare yourself for an onslaught of people trying to offer you transportation at the Cancun airport. 2. Beware of the expensive transit which your travel agent or hotel might set up for you. We went to Tulum and back in a nice air-condtioned bus, and paid for entrance to the ruins for $10 per person on the ADO bus. Organized tour buses set up by your hotel might cost $60-100 each, and force you to follow a strict timetable. 3. If haggling is not your favorite thing, buying souvenirs or jewelry is irritating. 4. There is a persistent tendency for people who do not understand english well to pretend they do, smile, and say \"yes\" in response to almost any question.", "Date": "November 25, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "2", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Toronto", "Title": "\u201c3 Star at Best\u201d", "Author": "Party_Hardy_eh", "ReviewID": "UR6160302", "Content": "This is a really long review, but it needs to be to have you fully understand our \"vacation\", lol... here goes! ;-) First off, let me say we love Riu hotels. We are actually leaving for the Riu Jalisco on Nov. 24. With that being said, we stayed at the Lupita from Apr. 8-22, 2006. (Late review, I know, lol) We've stayed at Riu hotels many times, so expected the Lupita to be up to par with the others... It is advertised in the Sunquest book AND on the Riu site as a 5 star hotel. Not even close. If the Tequila IS a 5 star, then this is pushing it to be a 3. It's a hotel that the Riu chain has bought, so it is not built to their standards. The rooms are considerably smaller than any other room we've had at a Riu. (We've stayed at the Tequila 6 times, a Riu in the Dominican and a \"Secrets\" in the Dominican, so we know what to expect.) My husband is handicapped, and needs a wheelchair to get around, and this place is NOT FOR HANDICAPPED!!! Another gentleman was also in a wheelchair and there are curbs everywhere and only 2 cutouts to get from the main dining area/lobby to your rooms. My hubby constantly had to get out of his chair so I could lift it over the curbs. I don't know how the other man managed, as he was completely chair bound. There is next to no counter space in the bathrooms, unlike all the other Riu hotels that have the dressing room with a good sized counter. I had to use the top of the fridge for my toiletries. We had trouble getting the maid to CHANGE the sheets... even when they had blood on them. Even after ripping the sheets off the bed and leaving them on the floor, she put them back on!!! I swear she put this enourmous bug in our bed, too. (Yes, we tipped constantly!) Towel critters? in 2 weeks, we only got 4, even after tipping her $5 for one! The mini bar people were excellent. Never any trouble getting our Pepsi and water, and lots of it. We broke some glass at 2 a.m. and called reception for someone to come and take care of it. Not happening! He kept saying, \"someone come in morning\". I finally went to reception myself to get a broom. They didn't have one! It was locked up in a closet and he couldn't open the door. I kid you not. Tile floors, a glass exploded, and I can't sweep it up! Silly me for thinking that they'd have someone from housekeeping on staff at night! We found the food to be a major disappointment. We took the first seating and found the food consitantly would run out (what was edible, at least), and not very tasty. Several times there were flies and bugs in and around the food, and the guys behind the serving stations would just flick them away and laugh. Yes, it's an outdoor-ish restaruant, but still! Nowhere else had we encountered this problem, ever. At breakfast, I pointed out that the entire tray of hashbrowns was not only not cooked, but still frozen in the middle, and they wouldn't even remove the tray! The repetitive menu was depressing at lunch and dinner. Granted, I'm used to larger resorts, but you'd expect the kitchen to come up with more variety. There was one night that was actually pretty good, but that was once in two weeks. The resort was FULL of people from France, with their children. (The Lupita is pushed in France, hardly any french at the other Rius in Playa Del Carmen) The kids were terribly misbehaved and the parents just left them on their own. While lying on a bed in the pool, I actually had some crawl over me! Their parents totally ignored them IF they were even anywhere near the pool at the same time. This wasn't just a single occassion, it happened daily. The guests from France were the rudest bunch of people I've ever had the misfortune to vacation with. They constantly pushed their way in front of you at every opportunity. Lines? what lines!!! They would even step between my husbands legs while he's trying to get his food, so they could get in front of him. Needless to say, he was continually kicked in the feet while in his wheelchair by these people. As anyone who's been to Mexico knows, you smile and say Hola to everyone you pass. Not these people. Even the animation team can't stand them. For the same reasons I've mentioned. They LOVE Canadians because we are friendly and polite and our kids behave and have manners! We were quite unhappy with our situation, so we went to the lobby on the fifth day to say we wanted OUT. We were booked for 2 weeks, and the thought of staying there for the duration had me in tears. I was told they'd transfer us out as soon as they could and for me and to talk to my Sunquest Rep. I was on the phone with her office for a good 15 minutes, and they told me once Easter weekend was over, they'd get us out of there, and to talk to our Rep when she got there that afternoon, that they'd fill her in at the meeting that day, and she'd have more info for us. This woman agreed that we'd been sold a bill of goods, and this hotel is NOT what we rightfully expected. Well, she either lied to me on the phone, or the rep lied, because she said she knew nothing of our situation, but how about some of these day trips??? I was stunned. We asked about getting the wheelchair on the boat, (just to make a point!) or what about after you got off the bus, etc., and she acted like \"oh ya, the wheelchair... well, how about this trip then?\" and when asked, again, \"oh ya, the wheelchair\". She was only there to make her commission on the trips, not to help us at all. She even had the audacity to suggest that I take one of the trips alone, since the hubby wouldn't be able to go. Can you say, \"floored\"???? After a couple more days of not getting moved off the Lupita, we happen to find out that they'd been sending all kinds of people to the Tequila because they were over booked at the Lupita! I nearly lost it. Since I was in no state of mind to converse civilly with the manager about this, my hubby went and talked with her. She pretended to not know we had wanted to be moved. Acted all surprised in fact. I know she was lying, because the first time I went and asked to be moved, SHE was the one who told the man at the reception desk what to do and what to say to me, lol. Here I have to interject that we are Riu Club members. This is supposed to grant you certain privileges and \"status\" at the resorts. You'd think she'd at least TRY to accommodate someone like us, being such loyal \"customers\".... nope! She eventually agreed to get us into one of the Palaces for dinner every night until we left. WE had to pay the cab fair though! ($10/night!) We figured screw it, it's worth it just to get some food into us. Neither of us had really eaten in 7 days by now. Yes, the food WAS that bad. I am the most UNpickey person on the planet, I'll eat just about anthing you put in front of me... seriously... but the food was just terrible. AND it scared me. The hot wasn't hot, and the cold wasn't cold... food poisoning looking for a victom, in my eyes. Oh, and the birds got more of the food at the snack bar by the pool and anyone. Nobody seemed to give a rat's patoot about it, either. The ice cream machine didn't work half the time, and when it did, you had to beg them for the ice cream cones :-s Now... it's not like we don't know how things work, like I said, we'd stayed with the Riu chain 7 times, 8 including this visit. We tip... well... We expected somewhat better all around. The animation staff were great, i'll give them that. IF it weren't for a couple of them, I'd have gone mad. We were on the ground floor, so our water pressure was great... except the day we left. There was NO water, period. Couldn't wash our faces, let alone get a shower or flush :-s We booked a wake-up at 5 a.m. since our bus was coming at 5:45 to take us to the airport. The man at the reception called at 6 to say the bus was there. He then tried to claim that he HAD called us at 5 and we must have fallen back asleep. We argued that HE was going to pay for the cab to the airport if we miss this bus... it got really stupid. Luckily, the bus driver did swing back to get us, and told us that the reception guy was sleeping and he woke him up and asked where we were. That's when we got the phone call. The entire two weeks wasn't a complete write off, but really close, lol. The dinners at the Palace were phenominal... The other Canadians we met were great, and ALL of them felt the same way we did about everything. It's not just me being whiney. So, I guess you've figured out that we'd NEVER go back to the Lupita... even for a free vacation, lol. We have told our travel agent to never suggest this place to anyone, ever. Sucked doesn't even come close to how we feel about it. I've read other people's reviews for other hotels, and feel they expect too much for their money, or something... We feel that if you paid more than about $500/week including air fair, then you are getting ripped off. Mind you if you go here and expect a 3 star hotel, then you will not be disappointed.

Staff at the front desk where helpfuland english speaking and pointed us in the direction of our room. Room was typical resort room, slight mildew odour but to be expected with the humid weather. Housekeeping staff were great and made up room when sign left on door. Bar and mini fridge were re-stocked without problems with lots of bottled water. 2 pools of average size, clean and adequate loungers. Entertainment staff where great with what they had to work with. The guests just did not seem to be motivated to get involved with the activites. They seems to enjoy the group of Canadians (9 of us) they had to work with as was seen by our \"Couples Night Show\". The entertainment staff attended the disco on 3 of nights we were there and danced with the guests in the disco. They made halloween fun and exciting. The bar area seemed more ike a quiet night club which we found difficult as 98% of the guests did not speak english. We had read this in reviews but thought we could deal with it, I would suggest considering another resort if you only speak english. Mostly spanish, french and other European languages. Food was great and plenty of variety in the buffet restaurant. Only one a la cart which was small and mexican. Shuttle bus runs every 30 mins and is reliable but with a selling feature of pay at 1 play at 4 they are NOT within walking distance. Once the shuttle drops you at the entrance to the beach area, there is another 10 min walk to the beach or 10-15 min walk to the other resorts. Overall if you can speak French or Spanish and like a small quiet resort with older guest, this is the one for you, if not, take the opportunity to stay at another RIU.

Wouldn't have liked to have paid more for what we got but very glad we went. The place was always spotlessly clean and the staff are helpful and cheery. Always seen the poolside showers and walls or something random being cleaned to perfection. The night life in the hotel was aimed at older people though with merengue dancing and such but was still very energetic and enjoyable. The food was amazing to begin with many various choices and excitable displays but toward the end my boyfriend and I had to eat out as it seemed to ly heavy and gave us a 3 day stomach upset. We were eating a lot of the meat and oily sauces though so maybe something to do with that, being British we were not used to such extravagant dishes 24/7. Would not recommend taking excursions with the tour operator as we simply went to the bus station in playa del carmen - as the free bus drops you there - and made our own way to places like xcaret, xel-ha and coba, saving at least half the money it cost for thomson. The buses we used were more comfortable than the plane we flew there in! We felt 100% safe doing the outings by ourselves, infact we enjoyed it more so because it felt great to be in another country and mingle with the people that lived and travelled there. Some people may like to go with the tour op though if they would rather be around the people from your hotel and other Riu's, but we wanted to explore on our own to get the full Mexican experience! The free bus also dropped you at the beach after it drops at playa del carmen, very reliable bus service running every half hour to and from the beach, and what a beach it was! We went kayaking - free - and even 300m out the water was stil as clear and beautiful as the shore. A picture and discription would not do the mexican waters any justice. Night club in the place played britsh music to begin with but as the season began in Sept it changed to more spanish dance, stil very good. Only went to another hotel once, the Tequila, and this is why we think we paid about the right amount for our hotel. The Tequila was on a whole other level of size and quality and the night club was twice as big. The Lupita was stil a gorgeous hotel though and it was mainly french and spanish that stayed there but we enjoyed this as we soley went to Mexico to get away from the mainstream destinations. Recommend the beach club and snorkel where and when you can! Go to Cozumel for a more Mayan feel and Xcaret for an amazing day out. We also hired a boat for snorkelling from playa del carmen beach and we were taken to a reef just off the coast of mexico. Was an exhillarating site to see. We were out for just over an hour, paid 125 dollars between 6 of us for this and would highly recommened haggling with a local independant company, they initially wanted 30 dollars each, 180 total. You will find these guys all over the beach front. All in all, I had an amazing time and will definately be back to Mexico.

Here goes... Hotel Room - we had two rooms, one for our 3 boys (15, 13, and 10), and one for my wife and I. They were good in size, and provided all that we needed. A/C worked well (and it was very hot in April), and maids kept it clean and neat. Fridge was always stocked with pop and water. We stayed in a building near the tennis courts, and this was a good location. We always had clean hot water, and had no bugs or pests. Beds are of the \"firmer\" variety, but we had no troubles. If you have the room, bring your own pillows as the pillows provided are very hard. They do not have internet to each room (but who does?), but you can buy time on their computers at the \"internet room\" beside the bar. I give the Room an 8/10 as it isn't as \"fancy\" as some others we have been in. Food - all of our family was very happy with the food. There was plenty to eat, and of great variety. Even if we didn't care for the Entree, we had enough options to keep us satisfied. There were chefs there to prepare freshly made omelets, pasta, and other daily treats, as well as various dinner specials. We have one picky eater, and he ate like a horse. they have self serve cappucino machines for coffee, etc. so ask the staff for a quick intro. Food - 8/10 as we have been to AIl inclusive Hotels with outstanding food. Pool / Facilities - only one bar, and two pools, but they are clean and large. You have to be a little pro-active and get a beach chair in the shade at the main pool fairly quickly. No swim-up bar! but the bar is only a few short steps away, and this helps keep the pool cleaner anyway. Drinks were good, and didn't seem pre-mixed with cheep stuff! The bartenders were busy, but courteous. Ask them for their favourite drinks! They can make some very good ones that you may not have ever heard of before (and take a few recipes that you like with you, as they are always interested in learning new drinks). Here's a tip... Bring a larger travel mug with you. The bar glasses are small, and this will save you many trips! I noticed that all the \"seasoned\" partiers did this as the bars at the other resorts can get very busy. I give the Lupita Pool / Facilities 7/10 only due to the limited number of each, not the quality. Entertainment / Staff / Activities - Entertainment I would consider as \"High-School\" amateur quality, but they tried hard. The resort caters to the French / European, so don't be surprised to hear 80% french / Spanish. We were on the lazy side for the most part, but did partake of a few activities. Again, they were Amateurish as well. Staff were always friendly so I give them full credit for effort. The resort seemed to empty during the day as most guests left to the other \"sister\" resorts, or for excursions. Bicycles are of very poor quality, but we had a fews laughs as we rode anyway. I give the Entertainment / Staff / Facilities a 5/10 as they didn't add anything to our holiday. Others - Good items: free bus to edge of town and other Riu sister resorts, front desk staff were very helpful and spoke english very well, Downtown is an easy 5-minute bike ride away, resort is very quiet during daytime, and has very little partying after hours. Bad items: Only one bus, and is a crowded fight to get on at times, but don't let it get to you, it's no big deal! resort is off the beach, but you thus pay less! Recommendations: stay here, and play at the other resorts. You have to be a little prepared to haul a few things, but this still worked out very well for us. The food is slightly better at the other resorts, and the bars and pools are more plentiful and give you lots of options. We did this 75% of the time, and stayed from 10:00 am to 4:00 pm. For excursions you can take the \"Connectivos\" for very cheap leaving from downtown (they start from one of the streets NW of the main bus station, so just ask one of the taxi guys where they are). We saved a pant load of bucks going to Xel Ha this way, and spent the difference going All Inclusive there. We walked the 10 minutes in from the highway in to the front gates and paid at the gate. The Connectivos take you anywhere along the highway, and will stop wherever you wish, but they do not venture off the highway! Plan ahead! Over all we had a very good time at Riu Lupita. If there was anything that we would like to see improvement upon, it would be the entertainment and activities.

The staff were very friendly and tried very hard to involve everyone in activities and the night time shows were entertaining to say the least. The best part of the trip however was the \"stay at 1 play at 3\" option. You pay less at the Lupita but can then go to the Playacar, Yucutan or Tequila (which are on the beach). This was the pay off for me, but I think next time I would pay the extra to be on the beach. The shuttle is quick and comes every 15 minutes but it is still annoying to lug everything around all day (for example if you buy stuff at the HUGE market or just take extra clothes/water/book/sun tan lotion etc to the beach) We also lost power one night (not Lupita's fault, power was out in all of Playa Del Carmen) and didn't have any hot water for 2 days. Our phone was broken and the light in the bathroom didn't work but all in all I would have to say this was a pretty good trip (especially for the price, we booked last minute for under $800 direct from Halifax Nova Scotia). The food was plentiful and pretty good and none of us got sick (and we tried EVERYTHING). The best part of Playa Del Carmen is the night life. We went to the Blue Parrot and it is by far the best club I have ever been to ANYWHERE. It is on the beach (literally you can dance in the sand while standing next to the bar) and is divided down the middle into 2 clubs, one is dance music and one is popular R&B. Young crowd, cheap drinks (pay $6 at the door includes 2 drinks), cheap transport ($5 for a cab)....fun had by all. Enjoy your trip and definitely get off the resort...it is totally safe. I also recommend the \"Mayan Encounter\" excursion where you zip line and kayak in the jungle, rock climb swim in under water caves, visit the pyramids and eat lunch in a small Mayan Jungle community all for $100USD!!", "Date": "June 24, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "4", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Gibraltar", "Title": "\u201cLoved it!\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR5376247", "Content": "I'v just come back from one of the best holidays i have had!

The staff and animation team were brilliant, nothing too much trouble for them and the way they were always, and i mean always, smiling and being polite and cheerful was a huge bonus for us. The rooms were clean, the food plentiful and well served, and the drinks just kept on coming. We only went to the beach a few times, the sun was relentless down there, and if we had a tiny complaint it was the fact that there is very little shade on the beach, perhaps sun shades could be provided. We sampled the free non-motorised activities such as the catamarans, boards and snorkel equipment and also paid for the parasailing, excellent. A word of warning to those who do try the catamarans though, beware of the people who insist that you have to pay $25 for a lesson before you take one out, not nessessary. We looked at the other riu hotels on the beach and thought they were very large and imposing, so back on the rickety old bus, which was an experience in itself, to the laid back atmosphere of the Lupita. The Lupita is mainly occupied by the French and they do tend to come in large groups, so they can be noisy, but hey, they're on holiday too. We met some terrific people, english, french and canadian and this is so easy to do as the bar is the focal point of the complex, but if you don't want to mix with others, no one hassles you, this was purely a choice on our part. Activities are on offer if you want to take them up, you could win a t-shirt and dance the can-can on stage in the evening when you collect them if you really wanted to, but again, no one forces you.The shows are in the main very good, ; lot of hard work on the animation teams shows and some professional shows as well, well worth a look. We only went to the disco once, just to have a look, too noisy for us, but great for the younger ones, but they tended to get a cab into the town for night life.

Departure - Left Halifax, NS on Canjet, with the exception on not having any inflight intertainment (unless you want to pay $10) the flight and airline were great! We left on time and actually arrived early, and to my surprise the return flight was the same! Arrvial - We arrived at the Cancun International Airport and it's one of the best i've seen, everything and anything, from Bugerking to TGIF's, drugstores and shops. When you arrive you won't have time for any of those but there will be lots when you leave! Four of us went through customs together and only one hit the red light, a little delay and off to the resort we go! We travelled there with other guest only going to the Riu so it was a straight transfer about a 45min drive! When we arrived at the Riu we were checked in quickly given our room that I requested earlier in the week. We left for our room with our luggage left in the lobby, the staff brought our luggage shortly afterwards! The Grounds - The resort is overall very small compared to some i've stayed at, and this was a welcoming change! There are three pools, the main pool located across from the buffet, the adult pool located between to buildings and the children's pool located behind the Mexican a la carte. The main pool is were all the activitys are held, the adult pool is very quiet and relaxing! The rooms are basic, nothing great but they do the job.. the mini bar is worth is't weight in gold if your drinker, and the frigde is stalked daily with pop beer and water!!! The Beach - The beach is located about a 10min bus drive into Playacar, some have said you can walk it, unless someone knows of a short cut i wouldn't recommend this. However the bus does leave every half hour and is usualy on time. Riu Lupita has set up a private beach club beside the new Riu Palace. It is a nice club with lots to eat and drink. the beach is nice, but if you feel like takeing a walk along the beach, take a left and walk for about 3-5 mins and you'll arrive at the Riu Playacar were you'll have access to all there great food and pools! The beach at the Playacar is much wider and more beautiful I would recommend this beach. Also while on the topic of beaches, I also visited the Playa Del Carmen and Akumal beaches both absolutly stunning and worth the visit! Food - This one is very easy ... the buffet is great and you'll end up spending 6 of the 7 nights there, unless you go into town for a meal (witch i also recommend) The one and only A La Carte is a joke and if I were you don't waste your time there! If your a Macdonald's freak there are three located in Playa Del Carmen, I only ate the one next to Senior Frog's and it was great!!!!! Intertainment - There really isn't much of this, although they try hard and do a good job if you one of those people that like to watch a vages style show you won't get that here, take a cab over to the Riu Tequila the shows are much better there! Although the staff at the Lupita aren't much for performers they do know how to have a good time! Each night after the show they take any guest that wants to into Playa Del Carmen for a private tour of the clubs, they stay with you all night and make sure you find your way home. The best night by far to go out is Wensdays, the staff hires a bus and takes you to Cancun, were you get VIP entry to Coco Bongo's, this was by far the high light of my trip and a night i will never foget!! For those of you wanting to experience the Real Cancun enviroment i highly recomend this trip, 50$ US gives you a bus there and back plus an open bar at the most amazing night club in the world!!!! Trips - Four of us did the day trip to Chichen Itza, although impressive for the first 30mins it wasn't worth the 3hour bus there and back We Also went Snorkeling off the Beach of Akumal, took a cab there and back and was an excellent experience! Night Trip to Cancun, Coco Bongo's .. well you know how I feel about that trip!!!! LOVED IT Overall this was a great trip, the resort was well worth what i paid, I would return somday if i thought more english speaking guest were there! It really was a disapointment having to ask the staff to speak english, the spanish wasn't a problem it was the french the staff greated and talked to everyone in. To give you an idea of what i mean, there were 8 intertainment staff members, 5 were from France, 1 from the Netherlands, 1 From Cuba , and only 1 from Mexico.

The Lupita and the whole experience there was amazing. The Lupita is smaller than the rest, but it was more intimate...you really got to know alot of people there, even though we spoke english and alot of people there spoke spanish or french. But it was so easy to get past that and we never had a communication problem. Even playing pool volleyball, the score was always yelled out in at least three languages, so everyone understood. The resort is beautiful, clean, all the facilities are close to each other, which we also liked. We had friends stay at another resort who complained they had to walk forever to get to the pool, table tennis, etc. At Lupita, everything is close by and it made it much easier. The entertainment crew was fantastic and work their butt's off all day and night. They made sure they always said hello to you and they put on great shows everynight. Hats off to them! We can't say enough about the night time bar staff at the poolside bar! They were just awesome. We go to know most of them, joked with them everynight, and at the end, even got some of their email address's. From Iris, Adrianna, Bernardo, and Andres, each of them were just so good to us and again, work 6 out of 7 nights a week but always came to work with a smile on. And the housekeepers were great...they always did something different each morning with towles and flowers on our beds, etc....it was so nice to come back to a nice clean room and alittle something special made up on the bed. Not being on a beach was a plus actually, as it changed the scenery. It made going to the beach that much more of an event, and it was always quick and easy to get to it. The free shuttle bus comes every half-hour and within 4 minutes, you are at the Lupita beach Resort, and a quick 5 minute walk to the other RIU resorts, which you also have access to. The beach is amazing!! The food at Lupita and the other RIU resorts is excellent...we never complained once. And the Mexican Restaurant at Lupita ( you have to make reservations to have dinner there ) was so good, we went twice. ( Try the stuffed chicken..it's SO good ) I cannot say enough good things about our stay at the RIU Lupita.

Stayed at the Lupita from February 27th to March 2nd. We then transferred to the Riu Tequila for no additional charges. We really like the Lupita since it was as advertised a small and peaceful hotel. Our room was nice, nothing fancy, but quite comfortable. Food was Ok but nothing to write home about. However, compared to Cuban food, it was excellent. The staff was nice in general. Pool was ok but we never used it since we went to the beach instead. The shuttle was not a problem at all. However, the beach of the Lupita is pretty bad. There are a lot of rocks and I scraped my feet on the first day. After that, we always went to the Playacar beach which was much better. It's only a 10 minutes stroll and it's worth it. For the last few days, we switched to the Tequila since it was offered to us. In retrospect, it was a mistake on our part. The Tequila is a much bigger hotel, and with it comes disadvantages. It was more noisy, the food wasn't better and every table at the buffet was close to one another. Not much privacy at dinner.

Let's start from the beggining. My husband and I booked the Lupita for 7 days for our honeymoon from the 27th to the 3rd of April. After a 12 hour flight from Lisbon, we finally arrived at Cancun airport. A 45 minute ride from the airport and after droping other fellow portuguese in other hotels, we arrived at the Lupita. The lobby was quite dissapointing since we had seen other hotels on our way there. We were greated with a cocktail and were given our room key and a key for a free safe in the bedroom. They explained where the restaurants where and gave us a brief notion of how the place works. After a 5 minute walk we discovered our room to be very far distanced from the lobby and pool/restaurants and to make things worst it was on the 3rd floor (no elevators). The room was medium size with little or no luxury. It had the basic amenities, a safe, air conditioner, etc. On the 3rd day the tv remote control stoped working and this was reported but nothing was done. While entering the room the first time it smelled like mold. Other portuguese reported this and also that the bedrooms were not clenaed, mainly the floor was sticky, and the bedsheets were dirty. We found our bathroom towels to be dirty and also our sheets but they didn't smell bad so I guess it was mostly stains. About 90% of the hotel's occupation is french but we found them to be polite. Due to this, the hotel animation staff does things mostly to them. They rarely spoke any english... The restaurants were ok but after a few days you just want to get out to eat. I found that at lunch time, they tended to use the dinner's leftovers to do the cold salads and I don't mean the day before leftovers. The good things were the fish and meat they grilled each day so you knew that was fresh. We were mistreated once by a waiter called Augusto on the main restaurant... We tried the mexican themed restaurant (Maria Bonita) once and enjoyed it... it was a nice change but it was hard to get a seat as the reservations had to be made in the morning during breakfast. There were two pools plus a kiddy pool which obviously we didn't use. The main pool was never over crowded and it was very easy to get a sunbed at any time of the day. The animation team was doing their things during the day... at first I thought they were very good but on the 2nd day I noticed that they did exactly the same thing as the day before. And said exactly the same things. Like in water gym. They were not anoying though. If you weren't into doing something, they weren't pushy. We were not pampered in any way. We were looking for some confort so it was very dissapoiting. For example, they have no room service! Feel like having a burger at 01:00 in the morning? Forget it! The bar (Tequilla) was good and the waiters very friendly and professional. We went to the beach club once and it was ok. We also decided to try the Riu playacar, so we had to walk for 10 minutes from the beach club (where the bus left us) to get there. It was not that good to walk under a heavy sun... the bus could just go the extra mile. We didn't understand why this wasn't done. The beach at the playacar seemed much better but it was more crowded and it was mainly populated by americans. We had to \"borrow\" a sunbed to an american family beacuse it was impossible to get one at the Playacar. The food at the Playacar seemed of less quality than the Lupita. To end my review let me just say we payed 50 dollars for 7 - 1 minute phone calls to Portugal. As a final comment, I think that the Lupita did its job but it wasn't enough. I'll give it a neutral/ average score for the hard work of their very polite and professional staff. This hotel is not on the beach so its best suited for people who want to rest.

Great Hotel for the price. Not for someone who wants to be pampered. Food average but always something decent. Not for someone looking for 5 star dining. Not many English guests, mostly French from France. No disrespect to all French especially French Canadians but they are the only reason we would not return to this hotel. During our two week stay I did not see them tip once! During most activities it was the rest of the world against the French. We were longing for our nieghbor's from the USA. All the Canadian's felt the same. If you are willing to spend the extra cash go for the Yucatan or Playacar. Especially if you are single. If you just want quiet this place is great. For more details continue. We travel every year for two weeks during our winter. Past hotels include Aruba Holiday Inn, Occidental Xcaret, Playa Pesquera(?)Cuba, Flamingo Beach Dominican to name a few. No complaints at all with the staff. Sure english is not there first language and you may have some communication problems but there is always someone nearby to help out. Many of the animation staff speak four or five languages, so if you only speak english in a spanish country..........your problem! Obviously check-in depends on the number of guests, our check in went smoothly and our luggage was delivered to our room promptly. You are advised right away that you can use the other Rui hotels excluding the Palaces, for breakfast and lunch and drinks! Great Deal. Take the shuttle bus and walk on the main sidwalk to the the other Rui's its alot easyer than the beach. Most beach lovers/party people end up at the first one past the Palace. Rooms are small compared to other 5 star hotels. We had a king and a bunk bed, which was great for our two young children. There is only a shower and ours always had lots of hot water. Room safe no charge. T.V programing is poor but kids had cartoon channel and as soon as my head hit the pillow I was a sleep. Beds are a bit hard, we put the blankets under the sheet and this worked fine. Grounds are nicely laid out, nothing to far to walk to. The kids club was fenced and contained an inside play area, washrooms, playground and kiddy pool with two small waterslides. For the two weeks we were there there was little to no supervision. We were told that if we requested, a staff member would meet us at 1030 am and watch the kids, but we tend not to have any schedual. Pool is shallow/no deep end and well protected from the wind. No pool bar but main bar was poolside. We had no problems getting lounges. The activity team organizes many activities during the day and most take place close to the pool. If you enjoy being active while the better half tans this is a great place. Keep in mind no one is embarrased/harrased to participate. Shooting/Bocce Ball/Horseshoes/Beach Volleyball/Billards/Stretching/ Water arobics/Bingo etc. At the begining of the night show they call the winners on stage and give you a small prize, nice touch. Shows are typical. The animation team is outstanding! For not a lot of pay they constantly have a smile on their faces. Lock up your daughters though! I plan on writing Rui to compliment the staff.

No recylced food here, everything tastes like it should AND you're actually still craving it on day 7. The crowd is strictly European, something I prefer being Canadian and speaking a little French. This crowd takes their time dining and savours the whole experience in an unhurried Europeon style. They look great and are all decked out in chic clothes for dinner and the evening entertainment! ...but the best part is, with your RIU wristband, you can dine, drink and use the beach and pool facilities at the RIU Yucatan and the RIU Playacar...so who wants to pay up to 100% more just to have your room nearer the beach!!

So continue walking to Riu Playacar or Yucatan and take advantage of everything there... to us it was worth saving over 400$ weekly per person. If you are too tired to take the shuttle back, hop in a taxi for 5$ and you are back in a few minutes. Being at the other hotels made us appreciate the coziness and quiet of our hotel: no drunks in the pool bars and a more family-oriented atmosphere... of course it might not be what everyone wants, but it suited our family just fine. The tour combining Tulum and Xel-Ha was a superb treat for the girls and a very good value $$. The staff was very friendly... if you make an effort to speak with them in Spanish (as my daughters did), it makes a world of difference!

Although I've heard horror stories about the confusion at the airport we were in and out in about 20 min. BEWARE! there are a couple of officail looking men working in booths near the exits that offered to give great deals on Mexican excursions and end up trying to sell the dreaded TIMESHARES.While we thought they were assisting us in finding the right bus to our resort,they actually caused us to almost miss our bus.So if they call you over with the pretense to help,just ignore them and keep walking.The prosess of getting on the right bus to your resort is,however, very confusing.The bus ride [van] to the Lupita is about an hour.The resort is the smallest of the RIU's but it is very clean and cosy. There are 2 pools and a kids pool. One pool is the busy pool with daily activities going on and the other pool is the quiet pool[smaller].The rooms are a little on the small side but your not going to Mexico to stay in your room all week.However, they do have sat.t.v. and a fully stocked fridge [beer,water, pop] that is restocked every other day. Also there is of course the booze dispensers right in your room [rum,vodka,gin,whiskey]if you do decide to stay in your room. O.K. the good things about the Lupita; when you stay at the Riu's you can also play at the other Riu's [Tequila,Playacar,Yucatan] meaning you can eat at the restaurants on these resorts [breakfast and lunch only,no supper reservations] and use the bars, beaches and facillities.The food at all the resorts is,without a doubt,the best food I've ever eaten at any of the all-inclusives we've been to. We've been to Cuba twice and the D.R. once and the food does not even come close in comparison.The staff at the Lupita is very friendly and efficiant and the maids do a great job.While we were there, the resort was almost at capasity and about 75% French. Unfortunatly, I found the french to be [mostly] very rude.[pushing in line at the buffet,the bar and the line up for the bus to the beach without a word of apollagy]. We did meet some other people from Canada[hello to Danny,Marlene and Roland from Manitoba and Jamie,Carole,David and Marilyn from Thunder Bay and a very nice couple from the U.S. [Sue and David from Minnasota] who were great people to spend a few evenings with.The bar at the Lupita was usually very busy, but we found that once you tipped the bartenders a few times you never had to wait long before you got service with a smile. I know some people don't like to tip at all-inclusive but I've found that a couple of dollars here and there makes a world of differance in service. There was a shuttle service to the shopping distrct of Playa Del Carmen or just a 15-20 min walk. Be aware that the vendors here can be very agressive, but don't let that deter you from this experiance. Now the bad thing about the Lupita; it is not on the beach and you have to take a shuttle to the beach club and back and it is really a little to far to walk in the heat.Once there you'll find that the Lupita beach is not very good.I suggest you get off the shuttle and walk the 5 mins down to the Playacar or Yucatan beach as it is far bigger and nicer. There is no real snorkling off the beaches as the waves churn up the sand making it hard to see underwater unless you go out really deep. If you like to snorkle it would be worth your while to check out XEL-HA. It is an excusion of a life time. Huge amounts of fish of all kinds,swimming with dolphins and great food and more for about 80 U.S.[transportation included]I highly recommend it. All in all it was a great trip and a very nice resort.We can't wait to go back, but next time we will try the Riu Playacar or Yucatan because it is right on the beach and we are beach lovers.The shuttle to and from the Lupita every day got to be a little hectic.Just two other things.The weather was awesome. It did rain a couple days but the rain only lasts for about 40 min then turns sunny again.The last thing,once again , watch out for the TIMESHARE guys on the beach. They try to entice you with cheap excursions and an offer to check out thier resort and if you go they will try to sell you on thier hotel and they won't take no for an answer.", "Date": "March 7, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "4", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Ontario, Canada", "Title": "\u201cPleasantly surprised\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR4565153", "Content": "It's a nice hotel.

Regarding food - good in the buffet restaurant but we never had a chance to try the Mexican. I loved breakfast, lots of variety. We didn't lunch there as we took the shuttle to the beach, but supper was good too. My only complaint about food was the dessert section - it was not the greatest. Drinks were great and plentiful, we never had to wait very long at the bar. The main pool was nice, the entertainment we didn't really pay attention too, wasn't our thing. The beach club was quiet - we went there the first day and decided we wanted to go somewhere more lively. We spent most of our time at the Riu Yucatan, it was great. We only had two complaints about the Lupita - our room wasn't cleaned very well (and yes we tipped) and the shuttle to the beach was annoying.

I've used this site a lot in deciding my vacation choices, so I'll return the favour. Hotel room - small room and small bathroom, but everything was clean and the view was quite nice (looking over the golf course) It was quiet at night, but you do hear your neighbours when they get up in the morning. The building are nicely painted, unfortunately they have a very ugly staircase going up the fronts of the buildings. (it can't be helped) Pools - Small, but very nice. The adults pool had nice gardens around it and the main pool had the restaurant and bar right near it. Most people leave the resort during the day, so it can be very quiet and private. Gardens - nicely landscaped, unfortunately the hurricane did a lot of damage to the large trees - but this is everywhere in Playa del Carmen - I'm sure it will look better in a few months. Restaurants - We only ate at the buffet. It's an open air restaurant- which I really like! Dinner time was quite busy, but we only had to wait about 5 minutes to get a table. Staff worked very hard, but it was inconsistant. One day our waiter did everything, got us drinks, made sure everything was good, spent a few minutes with small talk, filled our cups without asking - first rate! Other days we didn't even see a waiter, no drinks, no cleaning up ect. One thing - they were very over booked and perhaps they were short staffed for the large demand. On Valentine's day, we were given champagne and all the girl's got a rose - nice touch! Food - Was good, nothing thrilling, we always had enough to choose from. Entertainment - Really good. It was usually a small crowd but that made it that much more fun. The staff got right down on ground level, among the audience. Beach Club - It's right beside the new Riu Palace Mayan Riveria. It's done up very nice, with it's own restaurant, volleyball court & Loungers. You do have to climb down a set of stairs to get to the water. The water has some rocks, so swim to the right of the beach club (VIVA''s beach) I thinks it's better there. There had been some talk about not being able to use the other Riu's resorts, but up until now you still could. We walked twice from the Riu Lupita to the Riu Yucatan, it took 30 minutes, and it was a very nice walk. When facing the street from the Lupita, turn left and walk along the cobble side walk. You will be walking around the golf course, the Yucatan will be on your right and the Tequila on your left. Rooms - If I had a choice I would pick the rooms around the small adults pool. It seemed really nice, with nice views of the gardens and pool. Be aware that the disco is also in this area, I'm not sure if it can be heard during the night. We found this hotel didn't have a lot of English speaking patrons. This didn't bother us, but it's something to be aware of. The staff can both speak and understand English very well. We also found that there were a lot of families, with small children (wasn't a problem - kids are on vacation too) We only had 2 small problems, and both were fixed within 5 minutes. Would I go here again? I'm not sure, it was nice, but I've been to to many other hotels where I've been spoiled rotten. It has good value for the money and if they continue to allow you to use the facilities of the other Riu's it's really worth trying. 3 Days into our holiday we were upgraded to the Riu Tequila so I'll continue my review there. Other places I've been to St. Lucia - La Papilon, Riu Yucantan, Riu Jalisco, Riu Tequila - 3 times), Disney Cruise, Iberostar Tucan, Bahia Pricipe (Punta Cana) & Riu Lupita.

I traveled there with my fiancee we are both 26. I can't say enough good things about it. After reading some of the reviews on here I was not expecting much, we were plesently suprised! The resort is newly renovated, everything is immaculate they were always busy cleaning. The rooms are very nice and clean(but standard)the mini fridges and liquor dispensers are always stocked! The food was very good, we traveled to the DR last year and the food was much better here. We never tried the Mexican restauraunt though. The buffet had a different theme each night to which was nice. Not being on the beach never bothered us. We usually just ate caught the shuttle to the Playacar and spent most of the day there, then came back for a siesta and dinner. The kids club (mini disco) is very annoying b/c they play the same songs everynight! The animation team is great, very friendly they sit at a different groups table everynight to try get to know everyone which is nice. The shows were good nothing spectacular but good. This is not a resort for people looking to party, it is very quiet most nights. Which was perfect for us, we found it very romantic. I have read many reviews here that English was a problem but we never had any problems. The front desk and bartenders knew very good English. Some of the staff in the buffet didn't but we always got by. We did do some tours while we were there. One was Dolhin Discovery, there was a 3 in 1 pkg offered by Sunquest where you swim with the dolphins, snorkel and \"interact\"with Sea Lions. The dolphin swim was worth it but the rest was not. We just took a pic with the Sea Lions, and the snorkeling was pretty sad. Instead I would have paid the extra money to do it at Xcaret or Xel Ha b/c I believe you would get admission to these places as well. (don't take my word for it, ask) BTW you are not allowed to take your camera into the Dolphin swim. The other tour we did was Tulum-Tankah. We spent some time at the ruins and the beach then went to Tankah. Here we traveled across a natural Lagoon by canoe so we could zip line across the lagoon! Then we had lunch in the Mayan village in Tankah. If you do this tour there are children there(village) so I would suggest taking some candy or something for them. This tour was well worth it for us, we lucked on that no one else had booked for that day, so we had our own tour guide. We did also go snorkeling on our own to Yul Ha in Akumel. It is a less commercialized version of Xel Ha. This is worth it if you have your own snorkeling gear b/c admission is only $6.50 US(as opposed to $25 us which is just admission).

The resort is quaint - love the little villas nestles all over the resort grounds and the grounds are beautiful full of palms, eculyptus tress and beautiful flowers. They are kept VERY clean! The rooms are perfect. Air conditioning, a fan and the beds were comfortable. Teh staff is very friendly and if you leave a small tip for the maids they'll put fresh flowers in your room and leave you with one of their towel art animals. In the room you also have a fridge which is stocked with water,soft drinks,and beer everyday. Aside from that you have 4 bottles of liquor above the fridge (dispenser). We also likes having the safe in the room to put valubles in. The staff(bartenders, waiters/waitresses and animicion (entertainers) were very friendly. They would stop and talk to you and make sure you were having a good time. The animicion would try to get you involved in the show at night and they are there on the beach to entertain and get you involved- THAT IS if you want to - they aren't pushy in any way. but it's great to have them there :) Every night there was a theme night - one night was Mexican - so the food and show had a theme - another night was caribbean night- another vegas. There is the one bar by the pool and the main resturant. We NEVER got bored with the food- the coffee and fresh sqeezed juices in the morning was great. there is one a la cartes resturant ( make reservations early morning) the food was yummy - but prefered having the buffet variety. There is a dance club on the resort as well as a spa. They cater really well to families. They have kids activities, playground and pool speperate from the adults. The animicion teach the kids lots of cool games and songs and they get up on stage to perform everynight at the beginning of the show. They hand out prizes to the kids who won games etc... during the day. They also have games, challanges and daily activities for the adults during the day should you want to participate. Guests are also free to participate in some of the night show activities too. the resort is not right on the beach. but that never bothered any of us. the bus comes every half an hour. it only took 5 min. to get to the beach but i likes the ride as you were able to see the condos and area a bit. the beach was beautiful. it is a small area which we liked. we also got good seats and with umbrellas.the beach also has a snack bar. they offer slads,ice cream,snak foods, corona on tap and a nice place to eat. some of the tables are on the patio in the shade others are in the sun. again the animicon are down there during the day - so if you want to do aquasize or volleyball you can. we didn't venture to any of the other resorts - but you can go to any of the other riu resorts in the area. we were always satisfied at staying at ours and hanging out. we plan to go back to either lupita or trquila spring 2006 with a bigger group of people this time. perhaps we'll take up the offer of this great advantage. all in all i preferred the quaintness of this resort. enough space to roam and relax....not over crowded with people and it is very personable. by the end of the week we had built friendships with the staff and hope they are there when we return again 2006. if and when we go back we will definitely stick with the RIU resorts. we were very pleased with them.

(We are both 27) Yes, you can use 3 other Rius on the beach: shuttle stops are Playacar (the best one in my opinion), you can walk to Yucatan from there, and across the street \u2013 Tequila. Palace is between Playacar and Yucatan, with 2 Windham hotels in between. Food was amazing everywhere. We ate 5 times a day, 2 times at breakfast (7 then 10), same at dinner. Pools and beaches also great. Fitness facilities sucked at both Yucatan, and even Palace (we sneaked in). No AC, very small. You\u2019re better off playing tennis. Reserve at least a day ahead. It books up fast for the perfect time to play \u2013 4-5 pm. Also, if you\u2019re active, run/jog to the city right before dark, it\u2019s 35-45 min both ways, and you get to see a lot more than from a shuttle. Shuttle is every 30 min, but the schedule changed one day, and we spent time waiting at the stops which sucked. Make sure you get the latest schedule and adjust your watch with the bus\u2019. Entertainment was great, but you have to sit through the kid\u2019s show which is the same every night and gets on your nerve after 2 days. Tequila has the best disco. Cab there one night. And it\u2019s all free. Pacha (the disco at Lupita) is small and often empty. So ask staff what\u2019s going on there before you decide to spend the night at Lupita. In the City \u2013 a must see \u2013 Mamba Caf\u00e9 (closed Mondays), Blue Parrot (2 dance floors \u2013 R&B and Dance/house, right on the beach, with a lounge area with beds! so skip high heels), and a bar across the street from it if you don\u2019t dance. A lot of cool tourists. The Beach club from Lupita opens only after 10am, so you are better off going to the beach at Palace or Yucatan, not as busy as Playacar. If you run out of water (we did, and Lupita won\u2019t restock until a day after), you can pick up water at any time from reception at other 3 Riu\u2019s. Buying silver at the stores is same as in the airport. There are 2 stories in the airport. Make sure you check out both of them \u2013 they have a shopping mall & lounge upstairs. Food at the Airport is expensive and mostly junk, and smoking is allowed. So, if you\u2019re flying out early, grab a plate from the dinner a night before. We used to keep snacks in the fridge from dinner, since the snack bar was mainly hot dogs and other junk. Oh, try their espresso! I picked fruit from garnished meat plates. They did not have a separate fruit bar. Can\u2019t rave enough about the food. You\u2019ll see! Rooms \u2013 hm\u2026 Simple and small. I heard you can approach Tequila and ask to switch for $20 a day extra. Do that if you can. Plus, no need for a shuttle if u do that. All Riu\u2019s have 4 bottles right in the room: run, vodka, tequila, and jin. So, try not to get alcohol poisoning. A lot of tourists get drunk the first night or two, and recover for the rest of the vacation. Duty Free has $12 vodka, so pick 1 up on your way home, and you\u2019re set for a while. Also, ask them about their sell-offs. We got 100 cigars for $5 because they were getting rid of Spanish products. Go figure\u2026 almost for free. On the last day, we stopped at Riu Caribe in Cancun.

The beach club is 4 minutes by shuttle which runs every half hour, and not near as busy as the other resorts on the beach. We could use all the Riu resorts except the Palace, and spent some of our days at the Playacar and the Yucatan. But is was nice to be able to return to the Lupita which was much quieter. We were in close proximity to pretty much everything, XCaret, Tulum, Xelha, etc. The food was great and much the same at all the Riu hotels. The hotel rooms were very clean, cold a/c, and sat. t/v and a mini bar which contained Pepsi, 7-Up, bottle water, and Corona and was restocked every 2 days.

RESORT: Friendy and casual ambiance. Resort is nice, clean and just the right size so that everything is easily accessible. Our room was on the 1st floor in building 31 which is perfectly located (jungle surrounding, view on quiet pool, close to the \"a la carte\" restaurant, buffet restaurant, main pool, bar, theatre, reception). In my opinion, this is mostly recommended for couples and families. Young party animals should definitely go elsewhere. While we were there, I would say age average was about 35-40 year old. Most people don't go at the disco and are rather quiet during the evening. Animation staff does a great job with kids (kidz show from 8 to 9 every night). Animation for adults depends on the adults \"available\" for making fool on stage... Some show were good. Nice main pool but no swim up bar (very close to the bar though). STAFF: Alway smiling and make everything possible so that you enjoy your stay. Multi-languages staff at the reception. A tip is always appreciated but if you don't tip, you will still get excellent prompt service with a smile at the bar and at the restaurants. The only time we felt that a tip was \"required\" in order to have good service was that day when we left very early and forgot to leave a tip for the maid. When we came back, we didn't have any \"towel sculpture\" on our bed and no face cloth... I guess Thomas was upset not having a tip that 4th day of our stay... BEACH : Free shuttle service every half hour to and from the hotel to the beach club or Playa del Carmen. The driver is very nice and keeps smiling all day (always the same man 7 days/week from 7:00 AM to 6:00 PM). He definitly deserved a tip at the end of the week. Beach is small but nice. White sand, gorgeous carribbean sea, fun waves. Good selection of food and drinks available at the beach club. Some activities going on but they don't insist if you just want to rest. Can walk to the Riu Playacar and Riu Yucatan beach clubs either from the beach (a bit hazardous because of the protection sand bags they put to protect a part of the beach from errosion) or the road (5 minutes walk to the Playacar and 10 minutes walk to the Yucatan). We realy enjoyed our time at the Playacar since we can walk on the beach going south and we also enjoyed their swim-up pool bar. FOOD : Buffet : Very good. Large selection of food for every taste Get repetitive after a few days, but they always add some new dishes every night). 3 theme dinners that week (Italian, Mexican, Carribbean). \u00c0 la carte : Mexican restaurant. Good. You reserve at 7:00 AM for dinner the same night. Can go as often as you want if theire is availability. Would be nice to have a steak house or sea food restaurant instead of Mexican restaurant. I love mexican food, but I must admit that 7 days of Mexican food is more than enough... OVERALL : Not a five stars compared to the other RIU resorts but for the price we paid, it was very good. We had access to the other RIU resorts and could enjoy their beach, bar, pool and buffet all day if we wanted to which is a real must. Only dinner is not allowed at the other RIU's. SO : If you are on a \"budget\" but still want a very good quality hotel, go at the RIU Lupita. If you are used to 5 stars luxury hotels and service, don't go their.

So let me begin by saying that overall I was satisfied with this place. MOST IMPORTANT, if I were rating it on VALUE, I would give it 5 stars. I give 3 only because it lacks a lot of the services, amenities, and quality of other resorts I've been to in Cancun and Playa, but you also have to know that this was by far the cheapest all-inclusive I've ever visited. I also am always amused at some of the things people focus on in these reviews and cite as effecting their rating of the resort (especially-one time incidence like one rude waiter or one slow front desk clerk, etc). My negatives are more systemic- specifically, the food and the lack of a beach. THe food was by far the biggest disappointment. Again, I know its a budget resort but still.... I also didn't like having to wait for a bus and therefore being limited on beach access. HOWEVER, if you can live with those 2 things, the rest is fine! The rooms were simple, no-frills but were clean and comfortable. The pool was fine, as was the disco. THe shuttle service did make beach access possible, though only about once every hour and a half (not ea hour as advertised). OK, here is the HUGE SECRET TIP that made our vacation!!!!!.... If you go to the front desk the night before and ask to be put on the list for their sister resort on Cozumel, they will write your name down. Then you have to come back again in the morning AT 8:00 a.m. and they will check the list and if you are on it, they will give you a pass for the resort on Cozumel. Then when you go to that resort on Cozumel and give them that pass, they will give you a one-day wrist band so that you get all day, all-inclusive at that resort (sorry, I forget its name). That sister resort on Cozumel IS UNREAL!!!!! 5-star AT LEAST!!!!!! Food is and all services are OUTSTANDING!!!!! So if you are willing to go through the hassel described above and get the pass, you can pay a budget resort price (for the Village) and enjoy a Luxury resort amenities (on Cozumel!).

No fridge, no iron. the safety deposit is like 1.50$us per day... and it is big . The employees were always smiling, always there to help us with anything. One night, we went to the reception because we were looking for matches to light a cigar. The reception clerk sent us someone to our room to bring us 2 boxes ! That was a very nice gesture. The reason why it is only a 3 and a half stars, is because it is not directly on the beach, and because the rooms are basic. Apart of that, this resort could be a 4 1/2 ! The food is really really excellent. There is just one buffet restaurant, and yes they serve often the same things but with always little additions. Not a seafood place though. The a-la-carte restaurant is excellent but has always the same menu. There is purified water dispensers every 20 feet on the resort and at the beach club.
