The bathroom consisted of a large open shower, separate toilet and wash basin. All was in excellent condition, operating and clean. The breakfast is in the cellar \u2013 watch your head on the way down, a nice experience. It was not really clear though what the quick breakfast was which would cost 7 Euros\u2026 the buffet was very nice \u2013 I was charged the 12 Euros although I had no hot food.

A nice gentleman receptionist explained everything and check in was quick. Even though the neibourhood is not a fine area to be in , nobody bothered us, even in the night. In fact people seemed to be friendly than hostile. But the hotel is loacted in a peaceful side street. Rooms are small but modern, clean and good for the price.

For the price, the hotel was amazing - any others of similar quality seemed to be a great deal more expensive. We stayed in a standard double room; it was fairly small (as expected) but not tiny, and was beautifully decorated and very clean. The bathroom was larger than we were expecting, and gorgeous (also very clean) with a huge deep bath and great shower. Toiletries included were: shower gel, soap, shampoo and bath salts (which we thought was a nice addition) there were also cotton pads for make up removal and a nail file. No conditioner was included but I'd brought my own anyway. We had breakfast on our last day there; at 12 Euro it was a little expensive, but there was a fairly good selection of pastries, yoghurt, bread, cold meats, cheeses etc, as well as eggs. Location - it's very close to the Strasbourg-Saint-Denis Metro station, less than 5 minutes walk, so very handy for getting about. It is located in a fairly run-down part of the city, but the street which the hotel is on is nice and quiet.

Paris is so expensive and i had almost given up hope of finding somewhere, eventually booking a cheap and very ugly looking hotel in the city. Thankfully, with a about 2 weeks to go until my trip i found this Best Western Hotel on the Trip Advisor and after reading the reviews and looking at the pictures i booked it straight away! Pros: Great location, close to 2 metro stops, with easy access to all the great sights Refurbished hotel so the entire place looks great. Lots of nice little touches like a nespresso machine and iPod/iphone dock in the room. Staff were great, helped us locate everything we wanted and even advised us the best way to get home after seeing Moulin Rouge Great room with cosy bed, although a little small but thats just Paris Cons: When you walk around the hotel we were a little scared as there are lots of guys hanging around on the street corners. We asked the hotel about this and they assured us that we were safe and that they are just touts looking for business for the hair salons. The breakfast is a little expensive, 12 euros each! If you look around the local area you can get a nice breakfast much cheaper Overall i really cannot recommend this hotel enough. The staff looked after very well, the rooms are great, the bathroom was great, and i can really say that i made our trip perfect :) Tip: Shop around for the best price for this hotel. I found a really cheap price on booking.com but after a couple of days i checked the actual Best Western website and if you were willing to pay in advance, and no refund option, i got another 30 euros off the price!", "Date": "October 22, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "London", "Title": "\u201cGreat value for beautiful but expensive Paris!\u201d", "Author": "JKAMO", "ReviewID": "UR118569693", "Content": "I go to Paris once a year and find it tough getting accommodation that is not extortionate.

Located in an area full of Afro hairdressers we were initially surprised and wary at the amount of men hanging around outside the hotel until we found out they were touts for the hairdressers. We ended up loving the location for it's proximity to the big sites - it's in walking distance of the lourve and for being near the trendy canel st Martin. A great spot for people watching. The hotel inside is fashionable and hip with nespresso machines iPod docks and funky interiors. I do think it may look a little worn in a few years.
