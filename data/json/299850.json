This enabled us to immediately settle at the hotel upon arrival in Singapore and also to make it on time for our flight back to Manila. The staff's immediate favorable action to my request for an extra bed for my son is also remarkable. While the hotel is quite far from the city proper, there are public buses right in front and back of the hotel so it was not that too difficult to move around the city. The shopping center, as well places to eat across the hotel, is also a bonus. My only regret is that due to time constraint we were not able to try the hotel's pool.

You don't really care for a view or a big party scene as soon as you get out, especially if you're traveling with kids and want peace at night. In our case, it was also that we have 2 daughters who we wanted to have in the same room as us, and the hotel allows 2 kids under 12 to stay in the same room, and have a complimentary roll-away bed for one. We were willing to give up a central location. The Grand Mercure fit the bill. For around S$10 and 10-15 minutes we were at Orchard Road or Raffles area, and could get taxis back and forth with ease (though getting taxis in Singapore is quite a problem at certain locations). They have free shuttles to the MRT in the morning as well. And not to mention the airport shuttle every half hour back and forth. Pleasant surprises included the breakfast, which had a good variety, though S$20 per adult was bearable as 1 kid was free in that. Also, the area is not desolate, but in fact has two malls on either side of the hotel - Parkway Parade in front and Katong 112 at the back, not to mention around 50 restaurants in the area (including Nando's, TGI Friday's and local restaurants). It's a nice, green residential area. Oh, and there was free Wifi, though only for the first device you connect. This was a definite plus. The room was fine and comfortable. What was lacking was good TV channels for kids. Plus, they were stingy in replenishing the toiletries and there was no shaving kit. On the plus side, the room had an ironing board, iron, bathrobe, safe, fridge, flat screen TV, hair dryer etc. So all in all, this is recommended.

It's a very busy hotel, as you would expect from a chain hotel. The staff were friendly, but we did experience some issues on check-in. We weren't initially allocated the standard of room we paid for, but after a short discussion were 'upgraded' to a room on the higher floors. As it turned out, the room type was the same, but being on the higher floor had the bonus of water views. This wasn't really the case, so I wouldn't recommend paying the additional surcharge for this if you are deciding on a room with a view or not. The room we received had ocean 'glimpses', with a good look down to the pool area and out to the city. The rooms on the highest floors have access to the VIP lounge, for drinks & canapes etc... We were told that we were not permitted to go there as we hadn't paid for the privilege of the higher floor. After a day out sightseeing, I decided to ask again for access and another staff member said we were most certainly entitled to use the VIP lounge! Some inconsistency amongst staff there... The hotel is in a great spot for a stopover, I believe. You can take a leisurely walk to Raffles & Clarke Quay. There is a shopping centre across the road, and a great food market for those (like me!) who want to eat with the locals and not in the hotel. The Seafood restaurant strip is only a 5 min cab ride away too, & is the best place to get your chilli crab fix! The Roxy is also not far from the airport (15 mins), so is excellent for those early morning flights out.

The area is well serviced with plenty of shops and facilities and East Coast Road behind the \"Roxy' is one of the best (our opinion) eating strips in Singapore which caters for every cuisine and is where the locals eat and is not over inflated like the \"tourist\" eating places in the more congested areas like Orchard and Marina Bay. Also, we like the local culture and Peranakan food and the old Chinese shop houses and back streets like Joo Chiat which are so interesting and enjoyable to walk around and enjoy. If you want to go into the central CBD or Orchard area it's easy enough by bus, train (MRT) or taxi. There is a bus stop right out the front of the hotel and they also arrange free shuttle busses to and from the closest MRT station at Paya Lebar. Just across the road (Marine Pde) there is a very comprehensive shopping centre complex Parkway Parade. here you can get anything you want or need as well as a big food hall and plenty of banks, pharmacies, watches, jewellery and supermart. Next door is a local market with rows of stalls selling whatever, \"you name it!\" We were fortunate in getting a very good \"promotional\" discounted rate for this hotel via the net several months prior to travel and were further pleasantly surprised upon check in to \"win\" one of their scratchies and got another 20% off the total bill. The very charming young lady at reception then upgraded us to the top 17th floor. Somehow we got the full breakfasts for 6 days thrown in as well! We've never experienced such a win,win deal before in all our travelling! This was most welcome as the Roxy can be quite expensive. Our whole stay was extremely pleasant and we would be struggling to find anything to complain about. All the staff were very pleasant, friendly and professional and the concierge desk went out of their way to advise us of the free shuttles and airport transfers and provided whatever information we required. The breakfast room was one of the better ones we have encountered catering for all cultures and cuisines, the eggs to order a special treat. No complaints here. One nice little surprise was that one of us had a significant birthday during our stay and the management sent up a lovely birthday cake and card to our room. We never mentioned it so they must have got it off the passport. Well done Manager and thank you very much. The room was serviced beautifully every day and with an electronic safe in the room we had no qualms in leaving our valuables there. Also the fee WiFi and cable connected internet was a bonus.

To which my wife just glared at them and said, do we look like poeple that sleep on the floor....My wife and I then just re-treated away from the counter and did nothing for a while. After about 15 mins one of the senior desk staff came to us and said, if we at least could have a look at the room, maybe they can accomodate another bed in there, but suggested we would give them feedback whether this was ok. to cut the long story short, after removing two arm chairs, a coffee table and and a bedside table and helping a young room cleaning lady to do that, we had made enough room to accomodate another bed and to have sufficient room to move around between the beds and also access the veranda door leading to the pool area.

I especially enjoyed not being in the centre of town, which gives the area around the hotel a bit more of a relaxed feel to it. The hotel is only about 15 minutes' drive to/from Changi airport, which makes it a good place to be if you need to fly into or out of Singapore - although bear in mind the 2pm check-in time. POSITIVES - The room was clean, room cleaning was prompt and very good, and the beds and mattresses were very comfortable, with good quality linens. - Good quality equipment in rooms including flat screen TV, coffee making facilities (with mugs, not the paper cups you get in some hotels), mini fridge, good air con, and iron / ironing board. - The pool is great to cool down in after a long day, although beware there are no lifeguards. - Gym facilities are also ok. - Front desk staff was always unfailingly helpful. - The Park Place mall is located just across the street from the hotel and to the right, and has a hawker centre (food quality mediocre after two meals there) as well as the standard fast food joints etc. (KFC, Ajsen Ramen, Starbucks, what have you) as well as a supermarket (in the mall, turn right, basement floor). NEGATIVES: - The hassle involved in travelling anywhere if you don't want to take a taxi. The hotel has a shuttle to the nearest MRT station, but it only runs every half an hour, and then only in the mornings. Otherwise it's a 20 minute walk, which is not great if you don't like leaving a trail of sweat behind you. - The airport shuttle.

We also can feel how cold the iceberg is. It is so fun. On the sixth day, we go to Jurong East. There we go to the place of dinosaurs live exhibition. It is nice.

You can also take the bus to most common tourist points in China Town, Little India, Merlion Park, Vivocity, Clark Quay, Orchard Rd within 20-30mins at the bus stops at the front and the back of the hotel.", "Date": "November 16, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Sydney, Australia", "Title": "\u201cGreat hotel for an airport layover or short stay.\u201d", "Author": "Worldfoodies Posted by an Accorhotels.com traveler", "ReviewID": "UR120642815", "Content": "This hotel is ideal for an airport layover or short stay as its reasonably close to the airport and has a fantastic free private airport bus that will take you to and from the airport within 15-20 minutes. Many business travelers and airline crew stay here for this reason. The hotel is located about halfway between the airport and downtown Singapore. If you've ever spent any time in Singapore you will know that the traffic is horrendous (all the time) and getting a cab is difficult , so this is a big advantage if you want to be not far from the airport but also 15-30 minutes into town if you want a night out. Also, the hotel has its own private cab rank which is manned by hotel staff ( another bonus) and its not too difficult to get that elusive taxi when you need it. The hotel has a big foyer, great concierge desk and wifi spot/coffee shop. Other facilities include a bar , fantastic pool area and bar(currently closed for renovation) chinese restaurant and gym/spa facilities. The room are a little older in style but very warm and comfortable. A big bonus was free internet. There are shops outsideThe Roxy in a plaza next store so you can buy a few groceries if staying more than a few days and there are shopping centres and restaurants across the road about 5-10 minutes walk away. The hotel staff are really terrific and make a big effort to provide everything you need during your stay for this reason alone, I would come back to Roxy. If you are looking for a hotel that is close to all the major attractions of Singapore this may not be the best choice of hotel due to its distance out of town however it is way more affordable than other hotels in a very expensive city. We paid approximately \u00a3100 or $190 Singa a night as an Accor member. This price is value for money compared with all the other 4 start hotels in the city which are more like \u00a3250 plus a night.

This is a small property with a small lobby and small rooms near good facilities such as food centres, banks and Parkway Parade shopping centre, just accross the overhead bridge. During my stay, I saw crews from 2 different airlines staying there because it's like a short drive to the airport. Requested for a high floor smoking room but upon check-in was only given a 5th floor as the hotel was running full. As I informed during booking I was celebrating my best friend's birthday there and invited a few friends over, the hotel was kind enough to provide me with a small complimentary cake (looks like a sandwich) and a birthday message for the birthday girl. The hotel excelled in service and hospitality but the rooms look old and with dated furniture especially the 2 door wardrobe. Mattresses are hard and looks cheap while pillows are too soft that gave me a headache arising from my neck pain the next day due to no neck support. Seriously the rooms are really in need of a makeover. Eventhough i asked for a smoking room (i don't smoke but my friends do), I think the ventilation was not too good as I got teary-eyed and the worst part is the windows don't open. Had to go down to the pool on the 4th floor to get some fresh air. The hotel are in the midst of renovating their pool and from 26 Sep 2011, the pool will be closed for 3 months. What I read from the memo is that, they will reimburse you for transport and entry costs if you utilise the pool from their sister hotel at Clarke Quay or from a nearby swimming complex. That is if you really badly need a swim. Breakfast was good and sufficient to fill you up. Parking is complimentary and you have to get the tickets from concierge.

I was however quite disappointed to know that the hotel does not provide a 24 hour scheduled bus service. One of the main reasons I picked this hotel was due to its proximity from the airport and the fact that they provided a free shuttle bus to and from the airport.

The airport shuttle was fantastic, and much easier than being crammed in a taxi with our kids. Check-in was fast and easy, our room was much larger and more comfortable than any room we've had at more expensive hotels in Singapore, and the location is great. The first morning, I was able to run across the street to the mall for coffee and a quick trip to the grocery store (which is amazing, by the way) in about 15 minutes. We also walked to the nearby East Coast Park with the kids and spent a great afternoon there, coming back to order room service for dinner that was fast, good and decently priced. The last thing that was impressive about the hotel was the breakfast- the selection was very large and everything we had was quite good. Our reservation deal included free wireless internet in the room, which we really appreciated. It also included a free city tour, which I admit we did not take, because we were busy visiting with friends. It was a nice option to have, though. We did not use the pool, or public transportation from the hotel, but it seemed very convenient, and we found everyone working in the lobby to be extremely friendly. There is also a nice-looking wine bar and cafe in the lobby. There was construction going on two floors down that was very loud during the day, but we were warned about it at check-in and told that we could move rooms if we found that it was too much. We only stayed in the room one afternoon and our kids can do without a nap for one day, so it didn't bother us too much. However, if you have a baby or will be spending large chunks of time in your room during the day, you may want to request a room in a higher floor. The construction was on the 4th floor and we were on the 6th floor, and it sounded like it was happening in the next room, it was so loud! So if you need quiet, the higher up the better.

Well check-in was pretty much slow as the girl who assisted us was a trainee i presume as she was wearing \"I am learning\" badge on top of her name tag. So cant really blame that poor girl. After a long check in process, I finally check into a room. Much to my dismay, I found out that there are engineering personels in the room fixing the aircon. You cant be serious right?!?! Called down to the front office to have my room changed. It rang for so long until it got transferred to the operators. Dont the front office answer their phone?! However apart from that the operator I spoke too was quite lovely (Her name is Ida) She promised that she will get the room change done. I waited for 20mins and finally a bellman came up and assisted us with the room change. I was much amused by the fact that there was no apology call or even a call to inform about the room change. I guess Roxy lacks of personal touches. Cant expect much as mostly foreigners are working at the desk. The new room was much better as it has the seaview. Breakfast was good and evening cocktail was ok. The drinks had to be ordered not self service and between the two ladies working at the royal club, they cant cope on such a high volume of orders. Waiting to be served was a chore. We ended up only having 2drinks. Checkout was hell! Apparently they accidentally charged a wrong bill (which i did not consume) to my room. The front desk lady(annamie) was flustured and cant even take out the charge until she seek a help from her senior. After that was sorted out, she charged a wrong amount to my credit card! Come-on already! At this point I just have had enough. Another 15mins gone to void the charged and did a recharge. No apologies was conveyed. So just a point to note.

Croissant, white/wholemeal bread, cupcakes, pastries, scramble/fried/sunny side/hard boiled eggs, waffles, pancakes, fried bacon, porridge, rice, fruits, orange/grapefruit/pineapple juice, coffee machine(latte, espresso etc), cereals and milk.

Tap water is drinkable so there is no complimentary bottled water in the room. Mineral bottled water in the fridge is chargeable. Bath tub and shower in the bathroom with hot/cold water.

The room is spacious, clean, and comfy. 2. Near a beach, a market, and side by side with a mall (but the mall seems pretty quiet, not a popular one). 3. Check-in and check-out is so fast! No wonder, this is Singapore :) 4. Single beds are wide, 120 X 200 cm each. 5. I got the promotion rate Accor Group offers. Only SGD 88++ per night. Nett is SGD 103.58 which is very cheap according to average hotel or apartment rate at this time in Singapore. The price doesn't include breakfast. 6. Near Changi airport. Only costs me nett of SGD 15 for the cab to drive us to the hotel. 7. Free internet in each room. There's a cable to connect, not a wifi one. Weak points: 1. Far from MRT. Alternative 1: you have to take public bus. Of course, first you have to know which bus no. to choose. Alternative 2: go with the hotel free shuttle to the airport then take Changi MRT to go to other destination in Singapore. It takes around 15-20 minutes to get to Changi. Takes extra time because you have to go to the airport first before jump to the MRT but I prefer this option because I'm more familiar with the MRT routes in SG rather than the bus routes. Alternative 3: take the cab. This alternative is not easy either because there is a long queue at the hotel lobby, waiting for the taxis. 2. Still use carpets. Like I said several times before, I have an allergic to dust. Lucky that the rug is clean :) 3. The bed is unbelievably hard! 3. Far from any Singapore tourism destinations.

Yup, this is the best nearest hotel to Changi Int'l Airport with complimentary shuttle bus back and forth the Changi. Being an elite member of A|Club doesn't mean they will give extra service. Just plain but polite. Eventhough I rarely found hotel staff smile at me or any guests. Truly Singaporeans! The best thing is they have the MOST spacious hotel room and bathroom in Singapore. It is 32 sq metres. So great if you come to Singapore with family and want to leave far from hustle and bustle of city center and Orchard Road. Every room has bath tub, which I never used. But all bathroom equipment such as shower head, faucet, toilet counter were all dull and, once again, need immediate polish. Furnitures in bed room are also dull and look so old.

I was hoping I would not have any issues this time. Well, I was wrong. Enroute to France, I arrived in Singapore on June 19--and was given a room on the 8th floor, as usual. Still the same old dated furniture and carpet. Upon further inspection, I found a piece of chocolate cake smashed on the door frame of the toilet. On the toilet floor, just behind the door, were a few strands of 'hair'--yuck!! Needless to say, I was quite disappointed again. I arrived back in Singapore ( from France) on July 12. After a tiring 13 hour flight plus 7 hour stopover, I had hoped not to have any issues with my room. I was wrong, again! You would think that since I had a reservation they would already have a room assigned upon my arrival. Instead I had to wait for at least 25minutes. I told Venool--the front desk clerk who attended to me that I was really tired and if he could give me a nice room, that would be much appreciated. He gives me a room at the very end of the hall--adjacent to the exit/stairs. The room had a single bed and a king bed. I was alone...What was Venool thinking--or maybe he wasn't! I also did not like that it was an adjoining room--so the door leading to the other room had no lock. I was given this same room on my previous stay a couple of years ago and had rejected it. I had booked these 2 separate stays on a \"Stay, Spin & Win\" Promotion offer on the Accor website. Anamarie, the front desk clerk from my first stay was pleasant and offered the free 1-day City tour that came with the Promotion, plus the free welcome drink the hotel provides upon arrival. Venool on the hand, did not. I had to remind him about the welcome drink. An addition I appreciated was the nice Filipino bellboy named Edrian. He had a welcoming smile, very helpful with my luggages and was quite apologetic about the room at the end of the hall.

After lunch, I was given the room card keys to Room 820, tucked in a quiet side of the hotel overlooking the swimming pool. The room still has the old design and trimmings, except for the wide screen LCD TV.

I reported the matter to the hotel upon check out and received a prompt acknowledgement saying that this would be addressed immediately. The hotel is situated in the East Coast/Katong area, halfway between the airport and the city center, but the complimentary airport shuttle makes it convenient, with the city being a mere15-minute taxi ride away. As our accommodations did not include breakfast, we opted for good and inexpensive local breakfast fare at the Hawker Center across the street, however we had the light breakfast at the Lobby Coffee Shop on our last day which offered a SGD10 breakfast special, which was reasonable for the quality of items served (juice, coffee and danish selection or 4 pieces of toast wheat bread with jam and butter). The mall across the street is perfect for shoppers, and offers the usual selection of shops, and a wide array of restaurants to choose from. The Hawker Center nearby is also perfect for those who would like to try the gamut of local food specialties available at very low prices. Over-all, we had a pleasant stay, and would not hesitate to recommend the hotel if you want to stay away from the maddening pace of the city with a budget of approximately $175/night for a room with twin beds, without breakfast.", "Date": "June 6, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Service": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Manado, Indonesia", "Title": "\u201cGood for business but far from Singapore's main attractions\u201d", "Author": "netaholic13", "ReviewID": "UR111457114", "Content": "Stayed here for a 3-night business trip, deluxe room twin bed as I shared the room with a colleague.

I'm glad that I'm wrong. I e-mailed the hotel before I stay saying that I'd like to have a king bed, connecting room and I said that it's for my parents anniversary. The reception staff replied that they would sort all of things out. When I arrive in hotel, I saw that there's special queue for A-Club Priority. Since I'm Accor Advantage Plus member and also A-Club Gold so I decide to go there. The reception didn't ask anything about the status, it seems that she's probably a new staff. I confirmed all the things that I requested since I'm afraid that they wouldn't take care what I request before. I found out that the receptions is so helpful and sorted all things to be done, king bed, connecting room, and also special cake to my parents. Thanks to Ms. Jasmine who is very attentive in responding my email and Ms. Cynthia for sorting out all my requests to be done, my parents are really grateful for those. The room is quite spacious for Singaporean hotel standard although the minus is the water power in another room is weak. I've found that guy in concierge also helpful, thanks to Mr. Kadir for your attentive in arranging shuttle bus and also picking up our luggage to the shuttle bus. The staffs in buffet breakfast are also nice and helpful. The buffet breakfast itself are awesome. I really love their pastries, cheese, baked potatoes, fried noodle and especially the waffle. I wish I could brought home their waffle and pastries. The elevator in the hotel is fast and efficient so it will saves much of your time. There's a minor disappointment during check-out. It stated on my reservation that I would get another 10 % discount from the previously undiscounted price. Even Accor Indonesia staffs suggest me to remind the hotel to apply those discount. Unfortunately the reception staff said that the discount has already included in room price but I still insist that it hasn't. Although quite disapointed that the discount is not settled during check-out but I found that the Mr. Aaron, reception staff, although still trainee, very attentive and trying to help. He promised that he will help to settle my discount and he already kept my e-mail to inform the progress of my discount issue. The accessibility of the hotel is very good, the bus station is front of the hotel. I only took 10 minutes to Bugis and 17 minutes to Little India by Bus 48. I only took around 12 minutes to MRT Paya Lebar using their complementary shuttle bus. Going to Airport is also easy, only takes 15-20 minutes using their complimentary shuttle bus, depending which terminal you would go. Getting food around is also easy, just cross the street and you will have many options to eat in Marine Parade Promenade. No Free Wi-fi available in the room but free internet in the lobby is very appreciated.

(we were claiming one night with our accumulated points through Advantage Plus). It took almost 2 hours of arguing to partially resolve the matter. Meanwhile, our children were left standing the foyer with our luggage. The rooms were available; they just didnt want to concede the mistake through the booking system. We were finally offered a room where all five of us could squeeze in. That room was not ready for another 1.5 hours, so we sat and waited again. The end result was an entire afternoon wasted for the sake of $200 to a high occupancy hotel. Accor take note - we pay your wages. The property itself is not of Grand Mercure standard. The rooms and common areas are tired and dated. Also, it is miles from anywhere, and is really strictly a corporate hotel. Families are not made to feel welcome here. Breakfast was below average. Hot food was cold, no coffee or tea offered (had to get it ourselves) tables too tightly packed, food was not replenished often enough, poor variety., surley service (if you could get any). Restaurant itself was in poor condition, and its clearly time for a renovation. Breakfast was included in the quote, but we were made to pay for the second day anyway. Couldnt be bothered arguing after the room debacle. Accor take note: if you want your staff to understand what service means, I can recommend a visit to the Holiday Inn, Singapore.

Hot water was also cut-off due to those work one evening for about 4 hours. You need to have your shower at midnight if it happens. Power blackout also happened while staying there. No use calling the front desk as they will tell you they have been informed. No other information will be given to you. Remember, they are all trainees. When the guest relations staff called to esquire about the stay, all they knew was to ask the name of the offending check-in staff. Staff don't seemed to be trained in service recovery. On the other hand, the executive lounge was top notch. Service was excellent. Views are amazing with the large windows. Breakfast was disappointing considering this is a Accor hotel. Price was good with the offers. Wouldn't consider this hotel if paying full retail price. It's just not a hotel with a executive level.

The rate was reasonably competitive and I decided to stay here mainly to rest for a night after arriving in the evening. The hotel airport itself was quite expensive so that was the main reason for choosing this hotel instead. There was a free shuttle service to the hotel which I took advantage of. The ride was about 15 mins in duration. The shuttle bus itself was not the newest or most comfortable, probably being more on the lines of being a van-type bus than a true passenger bus. Part of the problem with the shuttle bus was that there a number of passengers arriving at the same time at the hotel, which could lead to prolonged check-in times, as the queue could be quite long, which was the case in my experience. The check-in attendant was quite friendly. I don\u2019t recall that anyone offered assistance with the luggage and it would be difficult to do since there were so many people checking in at the same time. Unfortunately, my stay did not count towards any points under my a-club account, as it was booked through the airport hotel reservations service. Also, even though at that time I had a Platinum a-club membership, I did not receive any benefits at all, such as potential room upgrades and late checkout. It could be that since the reservation was made through the airport, the benefits were not available but that would seem to be a strange way of going about things. My room had two single beds joined together to make up a king-sized bed, which was nevertheless not meant to be used as a king-size nor did it claim to be. The beds were comfortable. The room was reasonably clean but the carpet didn\u2019t seem all that clean in places and it also looked quite old. It wasn\u2019t the type of carpet that gave a plush feeling that you can get in the five-star establishments but instead seemed to say that you could walk on it without shoes on but it possibly might be better to keep them on you. The furniture and decor were quite worn and seemed to be quite aged. Overall, the impression was that the room was dated. (It did not look as fresh or well-designed as the Grand Mercure in Shenzhen, China, which I thought had much larger and more comfortable rooms.) The bathroom was quite standard but looked slightly small. The room looked out over to the Parkway Parade which looked to be a very good shopping mall. My room did not come with free internet access. It was a quiet room despite all the issues and I was able to sleep quite well. I had arrived quite late in the evening and went for a walk in the immediate surroundings. There was a McDonald\u2019s nearby and also a few convenience stores, which were useful. It became clear that the shopping centre, Roxy Square, which directly connects to the hotel is probably seedy and the one across the road (Parkway Parade) probably offers a better shopping experience. The next morning, I was able to eat at the hawker centre nearby which offered a wide selection of reasonably priced food and I was also able to see a few of the more local shops, which offer a better genuine Singapore experience. The hotel is located quite far from the centre of Singapore but there are buses connecting to the centre nearby although the nearest MRT station is quite far away and the shuttle bus to that station from the hotel only operates during certain hours of the morning. The hotel served my purpose of getting a night\u2019s rest at a reasonably good rate. After checking out of the hotel, I moved to the Marina Mandarin at Marina Bay, which was obviously a more upmarket hotel in a more central location. Nevertheless, the Grand Mercure served my purpose very well with a good location for food and conveniences.

The restaurant staff remembered us and always found us a table near the windows. Our package included free internet and we used this to learn more about local attractions and transport.

After sitting for 40 minutes without a drink, we just decided to leave. Breakfast in the lounge was a nightmare. Parents allowed their kids to run riot.

So when stopping over in Singapore there are a few basic thing I want, that is, a good no-fuss hotel with a good swimming pool and a good location. This Grand Mercure Roxy Hotel is probably not a good location for the first-time visitor to Singapore, it is just way too out-of-the-way, miles from a MRT (that's the underground) and the buses and taxis are there but you would have to ask yourself why you would stay halfway between the airport and where the action is wouldn't you ? Especially when you can stay right in close. This location suited me as I have been to Singapore so many times I can't remember so this was a nice change being out in the \"suburbs\", I had no particular need to go anywhere really. To give you an idea of just how far out from the action it is it's about a three hour walk in the heat and humidity (I know because I did it the other day) All that aside, my first experience of this hotel was to be left at the airport for well over an hour after expecting to catch their hotel shuttle. Now maybe I'm a bit thick but like many other hotels when they offer a shuttle you go to the designated area and get on the thing. After the driver passing me right by the first time I was a bit annoyed, the second time a further 30 minutes later he damned near ran me over as he drove right through, even though I was standing there trying to wave him down. So I caught a taxi after all that. Got to the hotel, checked in, asked to speak to the manager, told him of my experience to which he informed me that I needed to actually book the shuttle, otherwise they are officially allowed to run you down. Well that was crap ! You have to not only book onto the shuttle going to the airport but also for your arrival. This was not obvious to me on booking via the internet though I am sure it is there in the fine print somewhere. Let me state officially that I am not impressed with their appalling shuttle service, the driver was a miserable, non-friendly type so it's not surprising he preferred to try and run me down. If I was to stay here again I would simply catch a taxi and not bother with this nonsense that they clearly haven't got right. Apart from that the hotel was OK and like my header suggests, I would not want to pay any kind of full price for this place, it's just not that great and of course the location is not good for most visitors. I would suggest any more than say, US$120 per night and you need to be staying elsewhere. Staff were friendly, as they should be, and everything else except the internet was reasonable. On the point of internet, $7 per hour, $18 for 24 hours is just another major rip-off along the lines of the classic mini bar style rip-offs. It's too much and these days I stay at places that have good internet at very good prices, there are many places I won't stay because of that and this sort of rip-off is good enough reason for me not to stay there in future. If you have a laptop go across the road to McDonalds and ask to see the manager, he will hook you up for free (Good old McDonalds, they know how to treat their customers, even though their food is awful !) Get with the program on the little things Grand Mercure Roxy, stop treating people like sheep. Personally, I liked this hotel, I liked the location, it suited me. The little things add up to a big thing in the end so whilst I might stay here again if the price is right I can't recommend that anyone stay here really, and that's a fact. Check out the Merchant Hotel, but that's got really expensive these days too.", "Date": "January 1, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "3.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Brisbane", "Title": "\u201cContinues to disappoint\u201d", "Author": "Posted by an Accorhotels.com traveler", "ReviewID": "UR91248818", "Content": "Continues to disappoint even though this time we had club floor.

I know the girls at the airport don't work for Grand Mercure, but maybe Grand Mercure should put their own staff to greet arriving guests, so the poor customer service of the airport employees won't reflect on their hotel.

The check-in was smooth and included confirmation of pre-payment, the room type we had booked, the dates of our stay and details on breakfast, etc. In other words the staff gave us the feeling that they cared about making our stay comfortable. One nice feature was that we were given the option of selecting either breakfast at the lounge or at the buffet. We could make that decision on a day to day basis, so if we felt like a change of scenery or menu then we could chose to use the lounge one day and the buffet the next. As it turned out we used the buffet most mornings since the range of choices is greater but certainly the breakfast at the lounge is also more than adequate. The evening cocktails and hors d'houvres were a nice way to unwind after a day of shopping and siteseeing. The staff in the lounge were always courteous and welcoming. The location of the hotel was just fine. Great range of shopping and food across the street at and near the Marina Parade Mall. No need to worry about distance to other venues in Singapore since everywhere is reachable within less than about a half hour. Busses are readily avaible outside the hotel. We chose to use taxis rather than the bus since paying two fares on the bus vs one meter fare in a taxi made the difference in cost worth the comfort and door to door service worthwhile. One thing that is a bit confusing about taxi fares are the add-ons depending on the time of day etc. We never really got a good handle on that but most times we found the fares to be very reasonable. Don't miss a visit to the Roxy Bar. JayJay the bartender is very interesting and informative. He can prepare a truly authentic Singapore Sling amongst other cocktails which includes at least one of his own creation called the A-Club cocktail. . I would highly recommend this hotel. The cost is reasonable for Singapore.

But if you need to be close to something on the east coast including the airport then the roxy is well located. Despite spending so many nights here per year i never feel any special treatment. Not even a welcome back. Moreover no special requests (eg asking for sunscreen - not that special i dont think) are welcomed nor are they fulfiled. At the pool i was told to \"go back to my room and call room service.\" I would have preferred \"normally you need to ask for this in your room but i;ll call on your behalf and have some brought to you.\" Also the air-conditioning is VERY loud- making it hard to sleep. Also if often takes up to 5-7 minutes to travel from floor 12 to level 1 - doesn't sound like long but trust me day after day this gets annoying. Its little things like this that let the hotel down.

I have been doing this for the last 6 years. Convenience is the only reason that keeps me from choosing other accommodations. The up side is that it has free airport shuttle every 30 minutes. Despite my annual stay at this hotel, I have never been accorded a 'welcome back ' greeting. The front desk staff, mostly young ladies,are unfriendly made-up faces. Often pretty but stiff. Perhaps it is because I am Asian, and woman. I have noticed a smile break out when they encounter caucasian men, though. My room was as expected, always at the 8th floor--same old smelly, faded carpet, old dated furniture, dusty curtains and very basic bathroom. This time, there was a half-empty plastic bottle of orange juice (from the previous guest) in the fridge that housekeeping forgot to clear. And just outside my room, there was this ball of dirt on the side of the hall way--just like what you see inside your vacuum cleaner. Everyday, I would pass this ball of dirt. ( i even took a photo!) Until my departure date, this ball of dirt, along with other small bits of paper and stuffs, remained on the floor. This only meant that the hallway was never vacuumed in all the 8 days I was there. There have been some changes this year--a bigger lounge area at the lobby, and improved menu fare at the lobby Cafe. Breakfast items have also slightly improved. But the staff have remained stiff, unfriendly and robot-like. As if it were forbidden to greet guests with a friendly smile--esp. in the morning. There are very few hotels in the East of Singapore. And because of proximity to family, I have always ended-up choosing the Roxy despite my unhappiness. There is a big chance, this year, that I will make a 2nd trip to Singapore . This time, my husband will be able to join me. For the every increasing room rates , perhaps this time we might as well make that big switch to Orchard Road.

Our destination was the Grand Mercure Roxy. We couldn\u2019t have done better. The staff of the Grand Mercure made our stay in Singapore comfortable and manageable. For a start, staff met us at the airport and checked us all in there (unheard of in four previous trips). This saved us the previously inevitable long wait at the front desk while each member of the party, now tired after the long air trip and bus ride, signed themselves in. The airport check-in meant that all of us could go straight to our rooms and freshen up for the next part of our day. Departure was similarly dealt with. Teachers collected keys from each student and all keys were handed in by the teachers, instead of once again having to deal with eighty-four check-outs. We made sure all bills \u2013 phone, laundry and room-service were settled by students two nights before departure. Between check-in and check-out, hotel staff went out of their way to ensure that our every need was met. A room was made available free of charge for instruments; early breakfasts when playing engagements or departure time necessitated were accommodated; special requests - such as student room phone shutdowns at night, clearing out of minibars - were met with cheerful and positive responses. The welcome and farewell dinners were memorable occasions. The setting for the farewell dinner in particular was just about good enough for a wedding reception. Breakfast was always a sumptuous affair with a variety of Asian and Western dishes available. Hovering staff members always obliged with a cup of tea or coffee or with the clearing up of a table. We also found the front desk and concierge staff courteous, considerate and knowledgeable. Bus, taxi and metro information, shopping information and tourist information were at the fingertips of the concierge staff. We couldn\u2019t have asked for more.

The first good thing about this hotel is that they provide a free shuttle from airport to the hotel. Dont forget to mention in the airport terminal reception and they will arrange for the van immediately to pick you up. They have the service every half an hour. Once you reach the hotel, the check in is quiet easy. They get the credit card details just to block the money but they don\u2019t charge at that point of time. We actually paid around Rs. 19500 for 5 nights. It was under a master card offer provided by the accord hotels which I should say is really heap for the quality provided. Check out for other such offers now and then in their website. We had requested for a early check in and the room was ready for us. We had gone for a premium room. It was a very spacious one with a queen size bed. The bathroom was also very neat and clean. We can adjust the ac settings to our requirement. The towels and bathrobes were also very tidy. The room was facing the swimming pool beneath and has an excellent view during the night with well lit lights. We just had breakfast in the restaurant which was really good with nice varieties. There is a nice little veg and Non veg Indian restaurant nearby (10 mins walk) to the hotel which is also really good for the Indian people. You have cabs waiting just outside the hotel door to take you to places. Just opposite to the hotel, there is a medium sized mall with some good food shops. The bus stop is also just next to the hotel with a 2 min walk. The only disadvantage for the hotel is that there is no railway station near to the hotel. You have to catch a bus or cab to get to the MRTS which will take around 15 mins travel. The east coast park along the beach is also nearby ( 20 mins walk) to the hotel. We had a nice evening walk there. The staffs in the hotel are real helpful and also have a smiling face. The travel advisor was also very patient enough to give us all the details of trains / buses and the route to reach the tourist destinations. The service was very quick and excellent.

The bathroom [which is always important to me when I travel] was clean and adequate. The shower had a good strong flow. The free shuttle bus service to and from Changi Airport was a major plus as we saved on Taxi fare and it was efficient and on time! Great location, just in front of the hotel is Parkway Parade Shopping Centre - with lots of shops and eating places. If you need to go into the city to shop - taxi fare would be between $15 - $20 Singapore Dollars or $1.50 bus fare. Both easy to get.

The good shopping centre right opposite the hotel has everything you might be looking for. We opted for a deluxe room and thought the extra expense would be worth it. But little things let the hotel down, which in my view showed a lack of attention to detail, a lack of management involvement in proper checking on staff, and really made me regret the extra cost we'd paid. 3 out of 4 pillow slips had holes in them. One downlight near the window was out of order. The water in the drain in the bathroom made a continual gurgling sound.

We took the package which included free breakfast and city tour. For the price it was a real bargain given the cost of hotels in Singapore, though the city tour was a bit of a schmozzle. The guide never told us to yell out if we wanted to get off anywhere so we missed our stop and had to go around again (we weren't the only ones caught out by this), then when we got out at the botanical gardens we were told we had to get off at a busy corner with no shade rather than go into the carpark area as they didn't have authorization to go in there. And we had to wait at the same corner to be picked up. When we returned to be picked up the next bus refused to pick us up and went into the carpark. It then drove straight past us again despite our protestations. After waiting nearly an hour in the heat finally the next bus came along (with our original guide) and because the intersection was so busy it had to turn the corner and we had to run across and down the road to get on (where we could have been waiting in the shade). Needless to say we weren't impressed! Apart from that though we were happy with the hotel. We had a standard room which was looking a bit old, and the room and whole floor smelt a bit musty, but overall was clean and in reasonable condition. The rooms were a good size but the bed was a bit on the hard side which didn't bother me too much but my wife found it quite uncomfortable. Breakfast was good with plenty of choice, and the free airport bus was fabulous. Also the pool was great. Can't say I noticed any issue with the air conditioning and it was not cold at all. There was just a tiny chill, but it was perfect. In a hot climate like Singapore you don't want a warm pool. You could laze in it for hours (which I noticed some people did). As for location it is a bit out of the main part of the city, but for us that was great. It gave us a chance to see the real Singapore. It's so easy to get into the city (just catch a 36 bus from outside the hotel and from Orchard Rd), yet everything is so much cheaper. When you exit the hotel turn right and walk 1 block down the street beside the hotel (Brooke Rd) to old Katong town. There are great cheap places to eat there, and it's interesting just to walk through some of the back streets. And there's also the hawker market type food stalls across the road from the hotel which are a true local experience and cheap as. It has a great buzz and is open late at night.

The Grand Mercure Roxy is in a nice location, within walking distance from the beach, with a nice mall and good food around the area. I have booked this hotel via its website, which promises 'Best Rate Guaranteed'. What I did not know is that it comes with a host of conditions attached. After my reservation I chanced into another which offered a lower rate, and wrote to Accor for a rebate. It was rejected on the ground that my reservation is within 72h from arrival at the hotel. Why this rule exists is anybody's guess. It irritated more so because my reservation was delayed by the Accor Club membership, which takes a day to be reflected to their database. But policy is policy and followed strictly. Checking into the hotel is fine. The check-in was fuss-free, and we were given a room on the Club level though not facing the sea, which is fine by us. The room was clean, spacious and relatively well-equipped with iron, kettle and safe. The king size bed is also fairly comfortable. There are some rough edges such as a couple of styrofoam boards hanging at the top of our window, limited cable channels and an LCD TV set was of poor resolution, but these don't bother us too much since we don't intend to hang around the room for long. What we are disappointed with is the service. The cleaning crew in the morning tried to enter our room without first knocking, and the papers promised during our check-in was not delivered. The reservation pointed us to the concierge, which in turn shrugged that they have been distributed and they're unable to fulfill it. Especially during weekends the poolside may also be used for functions, so we found it uncomfortable to use with 8 tables of diners lunching right by the pool and would probably be looking at us. Overall I would say that if you are really looking for a nice room in an equally nice location out of the city, but don't really care about the 2* service, this is an ok option. Otherwise given the glut of hotels, there are probably better options can you can seek out.", "Date": "December 27, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Yorkshire Dales National Park, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cGreat budget accomodation - not in the city\u201d", "Author": "makinupforlosttime", "ReviewID": "UR51214118", "Content": "We stayed here for one night to break our flight after an Australian trip and we had visited Singapore before so were not too bothered about doing all the touristy things.

The pool area is lovely and the food/drink outlets seemed good but we only had one drink in the bar and breakfast the next morning which was good. We ate out at a food court opposite the hotel on the night and it was sooooo cheap and to be honest some of the best food I had had in a couple of weeks after paying for the overpriced Australian food on our trip. The only downside I would say about this hotel is that in this day and age and in Singapore which I find amazing is that you still have to pay for the Internet connection in your room.

Perhaps if you had a lot of luggage it would be great, but because the MRT goes to the airport, it's just as easy to stay in a hotel near the center that's near an MRT station. The hotel is awkwardly situated as it's not really near the airport, it takes about 20 mins to get there from the hotel, but it's not near any of the sights near the city, and its not near an MRT station. You'll need to take a taxi or the bus to really see anything. While there are plenty of restaurants and the like nearby, it's in a fairly residential part of town. While the facilities in the hotel were great, the food in the restaurant was quite good, I would not recommend the hotel to anyone who was interested in sightseeing in Singapore.

We chose this hotel for its un-touristy location, because we wanted to be in a more \"real\" neighbourhood rather than among other luxury hotels or surrounded by malls that have the same shops and labels as anywhere else on the planet. Our room had a nice view towards the city and the sea (west-facing). Only the two top floors have room-width floor-to-ceiling windows. Rooms are nice enough, well maintained and decently sized. The service is good & prompt: we had a faulty TV signal for the kid's TV channel, and when reporting it, the maintenance guy was knocking at the door within 5 minutes. When he couldn't find the fault, his boss came within another 15 minutes and explained that the fault was with the cable TV operator, not the hotel, and should be resolved within 24 hours. Which it did. The hotel pool is a lot nicer than it looks on the hotel website, but the water was very cold during our stay, a bit too cold to really enjoy it. The best about this hotel is its neighbourhood, Katong, which is not at all touristy. There is a modern mall (Parkway Parade) across the road (Marine Parade) , with a food court in the basement, various a la carte restaurants ranging from informal to quite nice, a huge grocery store (Giant) and more upmarket supermarket (Cold Storage). On top of that, there is a hawker center with cheap food stalls next to the mall. Towards the rear, along East Coast Road and Joo Chiat Road, there are many good restaurants again, plus a good number of nicely restored Peranakan shop houses. This Katong neighbourhood feels very real, unlike the (admittedly very beautiful) Bussorah Street. In East Coast Park, there is the East Coast Seafood Center, an excellent choice to sample Singapore's signature dish, the chili crab or pepper crab. The disadvantage is the cumbersome connection to the MRT via a bus, but we ended up using taxis most of the time: a trip to the Raffles hotel area costs about S$12, even in rush hour, and the Vivo City mall (if you want to go to Sentosa island) is about S$20 and 15-20 minutes away.", "Date": "November 25, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "3", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "New Delhi", "Title": "\u201cNice affordable hotel\u201d", "Author": "Rohitcoolguy99", "ReviewID": "UR49758134", "Content": "We stayed at Grand Mercure roxy in november 2009 for 3 nights.

The other requirements were a swimming pool and easy to access the city. We decided to stay away from the craziness of the City Centre and opted to spend 8 nights at the Grand Mercure Roxy. Much to our surprise, the hotel is only 3 bus stops away from Suntec City (route 36 uses the freeway) and no more than 15 minutes max to City Hall MRT station. There is a 36 bus every 10 minutes or so. A cab ride from the hotel to the city costs about S$10 if you decide to travel after midnight. The big plus is the location. The Roxy is a couple of blocks away from the East Coast Park and the beach. Ideal for relaxing day or night. You'll find joggers, cyclists, roller bladers and swimmers using the park at all times of the day/night. It is also possible to rent bikes and roller blades for S$4 per hour. If the beach or sport activities aren't your thing, the Parkway Parade mall should provide a good alternative. Aside from luxury goods, I don't think there's any type of shops missing: M&S, Isetan, Body Shop are there. The food court on the ground floor offers an excellent alternativce for the hotel breakfast which we thought was a bit of a rip off at S$20 per person. The hotel also boasts an excellent (stylish?) outdoor swimming pool which gets the sun from early morning until 3pm. This means the water reaches perfect temperature. Sunbeds and towels are provided too. The swimming pool is actually just outside the Roxy Bar, which is ideal for a bite or a drink if you end up spending a significant amount of time by the pool. It is very kids friendly too - there is a small toddler pool provided. The rooms were definitely big and comfortable enough although the bathroom might be a bit small for such a star rating. As I read in another review, the towels provided are indeed a bit thin and old. We thought the service was impeccable (check in/out, shuttle booking) and the staff were very courteous at all times.

My colleague and I shared a room and we hardly had time to enjoyed the amenities in the hotel. We leave the hotel every morning at 6.45am and did not return till 11.30pm. Every morning we will be down at 6.30am to rush through our breakfast and the staff at the Cafe were so pleasant and cheerful.

The Housekeeping was heavenly! I think they have employed \"angels from heaven\". Each time we come back our room is cleaned, fresh towels, soap replaces, and nothing lacking. We never have to call Housekeeping to request for missing items. The Housekeeping maid - I noticed they are males, probably from China - they dont speak very good English but they know our needs!). He has been like our personal butler - each night my colleague and I would chill out with a glass of wine and he noticed there is wine left in the bottle and had the wine glasses washed and placed them close to the wine bottle! This has helped us from having to call room service for the glasses to be sent up and sometimes room service (in some hotels) takes almost an hour to deliver your request). We had a different experience... when we first request for the wine glasses, the room service boy cam with the glasses plus the wine opener that we did not request! How good is that??

I had to abruptly end my cruise on day 1 in Singapore with a ruptured Achilles tendon. A helpful taxi driver recommended this hotel because of its spacious rooms - easier for a person with a leg cast to move around. When we arrived, a wheelchair was waiting for me by the curbside. The hotel duty manager apologized that special rooms for mobility-challenged customers were all taken and asked whether I would take a regular room. Before I could answer, he did some quick checking on the computer and offered to upgrade me to a suite at the same price. The cashier came around the counter to help me check in since I could not reach the counter from the wheelchair. Friendly porters soon wheeled me in to beautiful large suite. I badly needed to change my return flight to a new date and from a new destination. I spent all afternoon phoning the airline but still had no confirmed reservation by nightfall. I phoned the hotel concierge for assistance. It wasn't a simple change as it involved different date, different departure city and different fare. The hotel concierge came up to my room to get the details straight. By then it was after hours and airline office was closed in Singapore. The concierge somehow got a U.S. number to call and secured a seat for the next morning. Without my asking, he also aranged for a taxi pickup for 4:30 a.m. Minutes later, the duty manager called to arrange time for my wakeup call. I was greeted by another duty manager when I went down to the lobby the next morning. He told me that arrangement had been made for airline personnel to meet me with a wheelchair at the airport. The morning cashier offered to put the taxi fare on my hotel bill so I need not bother to change money. The duty manager saw me off and again reminded the taxi driver to go inside the terminal and look for airline staff if none was at the curbside. The hotel staff thought of everything. Getting stranded in a foreign land with a leg cast was a daunting prospect. With the help of the hotel staff the situation was made less stressful and much more pleasant than could have been.

Other things to do and see within walking distance include marktets, and the parklands along the east coast. The parklands was great for walking and bicycle riding.

The room was a nice size with a pleasant view and everything was clean and well-provided for. The bed was large and comfortable, but the pillows were much too huge.

The second time I stayed here, the room we were given was a lot less satisfactory than the first - the air conditioning was noisy, and a loose air vent rattled all night, and it was difficult to sleep. Also, we were given the room opposite the lounge on the 17th floor and noisy guests coming and going late at night also marred our otherwise fairly positive experience. The breakfast spread in the hotel was good, although the food was only passable by Asian standards. The Chinese restaurant Jia Wei was also fairly good for dim sum.

On a plus note the pool is nice should you require some relaxation before a flight home.

Breakfast was fantastic with a large variety to choose from and a chef to cook your eggs just the way you want them. All the staff I dealt with were extremely helpful and courteous. I had read some previous reviews and was worried about booking at the Roxy but these were not experienced by me, I suppose you cant keep everyone happy all the time. The pool area was very inviting but we were too busy to use it as we were out and about most days. Even though this property is about 15 mins by cab to town, we did not feel deprived at all, the shopping centre opposite is massive and by the end of our stay we still hadnt seen all the shops. The food court has heaps of variety, but our favorite was the hawker centre next to the shopping centre. My daughter had Yum cha every day from one of the traders it was about $7.00 and we could share that and have left overs. Each day we would buy a bubble tea with pearls for $1Au. We didnt use the cabs even though they were cheap we caught the bus opposite the hotel to Paya lebar MRT and from there we travelled all around singapore, including Changi Museum, a day trip to Malaysia, The battle Box and various shopping centres. Once we purchased our refundable MRT tickett there was no stopping us. I also borrowed the lonely planet guide from the local library in australia which was also helpful. At the end of the day it was nice to get back to the Roxy have a soak in the bath and fall into bed away from the hustle and bustle. Oh, that was after collecting a 1/2 price cake from the lobby as we went up to our room, yummy. The day of my birthday I returned to my room and there was a card from management and a cake with happy birthday written on the plate in pink chocolate, so nice. At the back of the hotel was an internet cafe I wish I had found on the first day it was extremely cheap and fast.

It's got a big shopping plaza next door but other than that, it is a 15 minute cab ride from the city and equivalent amount to anything else of interest. 2. The room service is overpriced and the food was probably the worst we had during our three week holiday. Maybe we were just unlucky on that front. 3. The hotel is dated and needs a bit of a facelift. BUt then, in my view that's reflected in the current price and also they are doing considerable refurb works so I wouldn't let that put anyone off.
