At night you could hear the sea rolling into the little canal what was very calming. The bathroom was a bit on the small side with only one sink but was neat and functional.

Pros: 1. Delicious room service from the Oriental Bar - the prosciutto crudo, and the prawn salad were stand out dishes 2. Lovely room - although in the traditional Venetian style, it had been cared for and looked beautiful. We were in room 319 with a great view overlooking the water. 3. Good restaurant recommendation - the recommendation to eat at Oliva Nera, just behind the hotel, was fabulous!! The best food we had in Venice. 4. The museum - each floor of the hotel had a different collection of antique objects (everything from religious icons to fans), and they were fun to look at and very unique. 5. Bath salts - I love to find a hotel that gives out proper bath salts, as well as the usual shower gels and shampoos! 6. Excellent location - close to the Vaporetto and gondola service points. An easy 5 minute walk to St Mark's Square. Cons: 1. The bathroom - as someone else said, this rather felt like a glorified Travelodge ensuite. The floor was tiled beautifully in golden mosaic, but the rest of the decor felt tired and average. The over bath shower proved quite messy, as it was impossible to move it to a position where it didn't shoot water over the side of the bath (probably because the bath was TINY!). The shower curtain had definitely seen better days - I can't remember the last time I saw one of those horrid, plastic shower curtains in a hotel of this standard. The cover over the overflow 'valve' was plastic and not attached to the bath, so it repeatedly fell into the bath. 2. Towels were thin compared to what is standard in most hotels of this quality. 3. Concierge - on our first day, we asked for two places (with specific addresses), and these were marked on the map given to us by the concierge. Both - we were told - were on the main campo in S Polo, and we wouldn't be able to miss them because it was such a small area. The two addresses were both a good ten minute walk from the places the concierge had marked on the map. It seemed to be laziness, given that we had exact addresses with street names and numbers! On the first night, we arranged a water taxi to a ball. My husband confirmed with reception the name of the venue twice. We came down to reception, and were told that the taxi for our room had arrived. It took us to the wrong venue and - not knowing Venice - we didn't realise until the taxi had left. To give them their due, the hotel did refund the extra 60 Euro we had paid for another taxi to the correct location. However, this refund was accompanied by excuses that they didn't recognise us because we were masked (we weren't, and the person who had escorted us to the taxi had said our room number); that there were no available water taxis so people had to share (we didn't); that four water taxis arrived simultaneously (they didn't, and we didn't see any other ball goers when we arrived in reception to catch our water taxi); that there was a language barrier (nobody asked us where we were going, as the concierge had booked the taxi, therefore, no opportunity for us to even encounter a language barrier!). We had been promised on Sunday morning that the water taxi debacle would be investigated, but when we came to check out on Monday, no one had bothered to look into it, so we had to spend almost twenty minutes waiting to check out. The eventual rectification and apologies were much welcomed. Conclusions It would have been a 3 or 4 rating, if we hadn't had such a nightmare with the concierge / reception service. The rooms are lovely, and the food excellent. The rectification of mistakes by the concierge / reception team, and their many apologies showed that they do care about their reputation. But the fact that someone promised to investigate and didn't bother when we first reported our taxi issue is unforgivable. Go back?

Its in a very central location. We really liked the decor of the hotel it was typically Venetian, with a little Middle Eastern theme too. My favourite place was the salon where we had tea one afternoon, see pics. The reception areas are beautifully decorated and luxurious. There are antiques and collectibles all over the hotel which we loved as we are both collectors. Our room was a little tired but then the hotel is very old and I suppose it gave it a feeeling of authenticity. It was small and there was not a lot of space to walk around the beds. It was clean however, with a nice bathroom and plethora of toiletries (including bath salts): these are good quality and replenished daily. Lighting is very limited but we only really used the room for sleeping so this wasn't a problem. Then again if they could improve the lighting they should. We both slept well and the beds were comfortable, soundproofing on the floor above us was a bit of an issue on the last night as there was a noisy family staying above us and that disturbed our rest. The service at reception and in the restaurant was polite and professional. Breakfast was delicious and I really enjoyed the homemade breads and jams. I still crave their peach jam which was the best I have ever had. Wifi Internet access was free for me but this could depend on your hotel package, I was given a user id and password at reception and then could use wifi in my room and around the hotel. My overall asessment is that It was an expensive hotel for the type of room we selected but we chose it for its central location and style. We enjoyed it, but if you want a bright airy room with all the mod cons and space, go for a cheaper 3 star and then book an executive suite. You would however probably forego the delicious breakfast with organic produce.

After a quick change we went exploring with tour map as provided by the hotel. HOTEL The hotel is old world as is much of Venice so I would expect it to be hard to find a untra modern hotel anywhere. Reception was small but clean, tidy and the staff were always their to help. The hotel has two small lifts leading to your rooms from the reception area. Rooms are locatred on four floors. Our room was a junior suite with a lagoon view. We were based on the fourth floor and also had stairs from the door up to a balcony on the roof which in summer must be wonderful with a view over the roof tops of Venice and a view of the lagoon the other way. (It was too cold to spand much time on the roof in January). Bedroom was a reasonable size and had a separate area with tv and settee. The bathroom had sink, wc, bath and a tap shower with no shower curtain which made it very difficult to have a shower. Their was no separate shower. FACILITIES The hotel has a bar next to the main enterance which has low back ground music and helpful staff. But it is very expensive (Round of 4 drinks 70 euro every time). Breakfast was served a the rear dinning room of the hotel and was clean, tidy and had attentive staff. It was mainly a continental breakfast where you help yourself, however you could also have scambled eggs and thin bacon. The staff served you endless coffee which was of good quality. Evening meal was served in the main restaurant and was a ** Michelin. We ordered the sample menu which was 10 courses and included such delights as pigeon, hare, fros gras, caviar etc. The meal lasted 4 and a half hours and I could swear we had 12 to 14 courses as they did not include a chef's pre-desert and palet cleansers in betweeen courses. 'FANTASTIC'. The set menu started at 125 p.p. euro without wine. etc. The hotel does not have a spar or a swimming pool and this is not unusual for Venice as space is limited.

The metropole in Venice was a little disappointing, I paid about 375 euros for a deluxe double bedroom in September which I think is the best price I could get for that time. Shortly after me and my fianc\u00c3\u00a9 arrived I felt a little weary of the hotel staff, let me explain.... The room we were shown was absolutely tiny, it honestly was one of the smallest hotel rooms I had ever been in and I have stayed in tiny hotel rooms in Scandinavia/ norway which I thought were the smallest ever. We thought that no way was this a deluxe double and definitely not worth 370 euros. The view was the wall of another building and this wall was really close. We went down to the reception and asked if this was the deluxe double as we thought it was really small, the receptionist arrogantly exclaimed that \" Everything in Venice is small as there is not enough space\" and \" yes the room was small.... but beautiful, just like Venice\" however he went on to say that he could show us another room which might be bigger but not as \"beautiful\" . This room was much bigger and we had a view of the canal, we decided to move to that room. What was the motive behind this? I don't know, but the whole incident led me to believe that these guys were not very professional. Another incident , when we checked In, The same receptionist did a big sell on the hotels 2 star Michelin restaurant, he said it was excellent but we would have to be on a waiting list to eat there for the next three nights, unless... Oh wait a minute, , unless we went tonight. So we did.... We had the 11 course chefs surprise tasting menu which honestly was very average, our waitress however recommended us some excellent wines and surprise surprise the restaurant was pretty much empty! Another complaint , and I read this in another review, they gave us two single beds that were joined instead of a large queen sized or king sized bed. This was really irritating and I found myself sinking into the middle quite often, finally me and my partner had to squeeze in and sleep together on one side of the bed. I don't know why they don't sort this issue out. Breakfast was included but not close to being elaborate, any eggs or fresh juices were extra Ok so enough with the complaining, I guess you can't expect a lot from hotels in Venice, they know they can charge you a high price and not provide you with the best, also they can get away with run down mix match decor and most people will think it's quInt, romAntic and charming. To be fair , the service was otherwise suprisingly good and the receptionist was friendly and helped us out with whatever information we needed. The hotel had a nice courtyard with a bar and they served food there as well. The restaurant staff was extremely friendly and efficient, which We appreciated. For most people the metropole can be a cute quaint hotel in Venice but to the seasoned traveller who expects attention to detail and perfection in hospitality this hotel is very far from the mark. I wouldn't recommend it to any of my friends, perhaps I should have been prepared to pay a lot more and stayed in a better hotel in Venice .

Our family of five plus our friends who are our children's god-parents stayed for 3 nights in June. As we were traveling with 3 children ages 7, 9 and almost 13, our room was quite large. It consisted of two king beds (Twins pulled together as one unit, just stay on your side and it was just fine) plus an additional twin that looked like a princesses bed (our daughter loved it!) As a plane delay and then connection loss caused our arrival to be extremely late,we simply text messaged the hotel to inform them then took a private water taxi to the hotel from the airport ($95 euros). It was worth every penny as it taxi'd us to the side water entrance of the hotel and the ride from the airport was just beautiful at night! Although the beds were very firm, we found out that it appears to be a preference in Italy no matter where you stayed to have very firm mattresses. The fact that the hotel is so old and at one point was an orphange where Vivaldi would give lessons to the girls, just added to its mystique and charm. The rooms were very clean and out friend's was just lovely as well and just what you would expect in an old, historical hotel. Our only complaint which we were forwarned in other posting was that the trip to Murano which taxis for free from the hotel to a factory is pretty high pressure and was told that the return ride was complimentary only with a purchase, and incidentally, the prices are fantastically high (it is not the only one on the island by the way and you have to exit it and ask how to leave it otherwise they will just put you back on the water taxi as if nothing else but that one factory exists) so I would just take a general public transport to Murano and save the hassle. Murano is worth seeing and the little shops and food bistros are quite good. That would be my only complaint...the fact that the consierge which advises you to go by their own private boat but does not tell you about the high pressure sales and cost of return, plus the fact that you have to personally ask how to get out of the factory so that you can explore Murano. I will say that after seeing all of the other hotels in Venice and on the Grand Canal etc., there isn't one that I thought \"wish we stayed there\".

I remember saying how lovely the pictures looked and how much I looked forward to staying at the Metropole. However, I was very much disappointed once I saw the hotel. Indeed the entrance is grand with the red carpet and great ornaments but the room was very disappointing. It was small and cramped. The bed was a total joke! It was not a double bed but two single beds pushed together with a gap in the middle. I found myself sleeping in the gap every night just so I could be near my husband. The irritation this caused was immense. On top of all this the air conditioning did not work and the control system for it was far too complicated. I feared to ask the staff as I found them not at all useful from when asking them questions on other occasions and quite frankly they were cold and somewhat rude. The bathroom was nice with the heated flooring but lacked ventilation, which it really does need. The television, even though not so important when on holiday, caused much annoyance and boredom as it only had two English speaking channels which happened to be CNN and Eurosports; never have I been so clued up with world news! I did not eat at the hotel restaurant mainly due to it being so overpriced but breakfast was nice. I enjoyed the croissants and tea. However, I think the hotel could have offered a hot breakfast as well- basically not worth the money! The location is fantastic as you are close to everything. The view is beautiful, especially if you have a bedroom facing the water but we did not have that.

Through various emails with Alessandro and Vio, finally picked a special Deluxe room with Lagoon view, room 403. Many thanks to Alessandro for the tip, cheers! Upon checking in, we were shown the other unique Deluxe rooms, room 401 and 409. Room 401, like room 403, has a square shaped terrace facing the Lagoon and the San Giorgio Island but its views were somewhat blocked as it is located right behind room 403. On the other hand, room 409 has the best unblocked view of the Lagoon to the front as well as the whole Riva degli Schiavoni to its right and to its left (the Salute Church and all!). But, why didn''t we pick room 409 instead? The reason - it does not have a terrace with chairs and table like rooms 401 and 403, it only has a small standing room only balcony! Once in our room 403, we were happy to find the cosy, tailor made L-shaped sofa, huge sized flat screen Hitachi TV, nicely designed bed, orange-white colour theme but most of all, the stunning views of the San Giorgio Maggiore Island its terrace offers!!! This is the view I loved most in all of Venice, to me, it is the most iconic symbol of Venice. I have dreamt of celebrating our wedding anniversary on the special terrace, drinking champagne in view of the Lagoon! And this dream had finally come true ....thanks to the Hotel Metropole! What I liked most about the Metropole is, its manager, staff are all ultra friendly and helpful, even though we were only staying for one night. That does'nt seem to bother them, as they had even sent us a complimentaly bottle of chilled Possecco (right spelling?) and chocolates! What a thougtful thing to do, how sweet of them ... Moreover, its room rates, accommodation quality, location, yummy breakfasts, cosy secret garden are also hard to beat along this stretch of Riva degli Schiavoni. (Of course, there are more luxurious choices like the Luna Baglioni which I had stayed in April this year but it also charged considerably more for its Lagoon facing Junior suite, minus a terrace ...). Oh yes, room 403 is especially quiet for a good night's sleep, important for jet lagged visitors like us! Lastly, for the minor negatives. I had found the bed a tad too small, there was no shower in the bathhroom and the toiletries offered were very very limited, food in its Michelin starred Met Restaurant leaves much to be desired ....But I am not really bothered by these small things. Given the chance, we would go back to stay at the Metropole's room 403 in a heartbeat. The next time, wish we could stay a little longer, with such a big terrace and superb views across the Lagoon, one could easily stay in such a room for a week or two.

They were all beautiful and interesting to look at. The hotels garden is luxurious,too. The fabric covered gazebo has comfortable upholstered couches and is heated as well. The garden is walled and gives the feeling of a hidden sanctuary. At night , candles are placed throughout making it very romantic. It was the little touches that my group appreciated the most. The divided silver trays had instead of pot pourri had many types of spices. They enjoyed the layering effect of the different objects in the room, combining natural items with objects of art. The day we were checking in the Metropole began decorating for Christmas. It was a real treat to see how their decorator combined things from nature (shells, coral, moss, greens) with lights and art. The Christmas decorations were icing on a beautiful cake. I had read in a previous review the Metropole staff was not friendly.

The only semi interesting thing about the hotel was the fact that there was only a bath, no shower in our room, but who cares!

On arrival the rather curt clerk boasted about the restaurant's Michelin starred restaurant, so I asked if we could book a table for that evening - he said they were fully booked, so I asked him to book us for the next evening; he rather grudgingly took my details and said he would \"let me know\". I never heard a word, but I can tell you that the restaurant was never full on any night we were there and it would be easy to believe that he was, perhaps, looking for some encouragement to find us a table. The bar is tiny and if you fail to get one of the few tables you can really struggle to get a drink - maybe i'm impatient but sitting on a bar stool for 15 minutes without being served, in a 4 star hotel, is no fun. Staff away from the desk were charming and efficient - our room was small but beautiful and cleanliness is first rate. Breakfast is weird and the Orange Juice was unforgivably poor, and extra!

We often ate just along the Riva Schiavoni at the Llondra Palace's \"Do Leoni\" restaurant, which is expensive but first class.

The only reservation I have with the hotel is the aura throughout. Incense is placed and spices are sprinkled in trays, bowls and vases throughout the lobby, lounge and hallways, so that a somewhat exotic (at times heavy) scent permeates the air.

The bathroom was also small but well-appointed. The bath salts were particularly nice at the end of a long day of walking.

Speaking of Doge's Palace, the best thing we did in Venice was to take the Secret Itineraries Tour there. It was extremely interesting and we saw the \"jail cell\" where Casanova was held and from which he ultimately escaped to Paris.

It has its own water landing which is ideal if you get a water taxi arrival (would defintely recommend) and near Vaperetto stops to enable you to easily and cheaply get around Venice.

We found the communal areas of the hotel to be fantastic - very atmospheric and interesting. Outside is a beautiful garden in which you can chill out and relax -read a book or order coffee or cocktails.

Our bedroom was a junior suite and I've got to say I wasn't that keen on the decor - it was immaculately clean and towels etc. were changed twice a day - but for me it needed a spot of upgrading even taking into account its historical/antique leanings . I do accept however that this comes down to personal taste. It certainly didn't spoil my stay. Breakfasts were fabulous if , like me, you're not too bothered about anything hot. This was available, yes, but at an additional cost. The selection of fresh fruits, cereals, breads, meats and cheeses was more than adequate at that time of the morning and the breakfast staff very accommodating.

The hotel is very charming with all these antiques, even if beeing Europeans we are less impressed by old things we can find in our own family houses than Americans. Nevertheless it's very nice and charming. We had a brand newly renovated room with gorgious mosa\u00c3\u00afc bathroom and a superb laguna and San Giorgio view.

The kids had a double room overlooking the back of the hotel (\"garden view\"), with a permanent noise of fridge engine in the garden, but that did not bother them.They just closed the window. At the beginning in our room the heating was off, but they finally put it on. The beds were very confortable.

They found a perfect baby sitter for our baby.And that was really a must ! We did not try the restaurant (1 star at the Michelin), just the room service which was quick and good. The little garden behind the hotel is very pleasant, and rare in Venice, and it's nice to have a little rest there after breakfast and before laving the hotel for hours of walk. So why don't we give 5 stars ? Just because they had no internet connection in the hotel and that we had to go to a internet cafe every evening to get our mails, and that was no fun after a day of walking.

Great variety of fruits, hams and cheeseas well. For Easter Sunday every one got a big chocolate egg, very nice gesture. The bar as well as the restaurant has a cosy athmosphere, which draw you to it, but as many other reviwers have pointed out the service can be rather bad.

This restaurant has a michelin star and according to the new rules of the guide, only the food is judged for receiving one star. The hotel should do something about the organisation both regarding the moving people from aperitif table to the dinner settings and serving the wine before the food. Several times it was the other way around. Saying that I still prefer bad service to bad food, and the food is well worth the star. If you eat at the restuarant try the gourmet menu and you understand why it is a michelin star restuarant. The lamb was delious and the chocolate plate couldn't be described in words.

They do set you up to take a \"Free\" taxi to Murano, the glass blowing place. After the tour of the factory, you go to their showroom where they give you the hard sell. Cost me over $400. My wife got sold on some vases. Other than that, the place was pretty clean and the buffet breakfast was excellent. Probably won't find much better.", "Date": "July 12, 2004"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Metropole Hotel", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g187870-d228963-Reviews-Metropole_Hotel-Venice_Veneto.html", "Price": "$263 - $989*", "Address": "<div class=\"wrap_bl wrap\">", "HotelID": "228963", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/ProviderThumbnails/dirs/0e/6f/0e6fb2c0479fe4e604557feb4686e5ef4large.jpg"}}
