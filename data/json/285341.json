Our stay was nice, but no more than that really. When we arrived we were greeted at reception by friendly and english-speaking staff which was nice, who took us through landmarks and routes on a map which was given to us, however, we were very disappointed when we got to our room which was on the first floor as it didn't have a bath which we requested for my mother. It was non-refurbished and as we had requested a refurbished room, it was obviously not as expected, this may be down to the tour operator not passing on information but not too sure. We went and complained and viewed other rooms which we arranged to change to a re-furbished room with a bath the following day as none were available, which the bell-boy did for us - he was very helpful and very friendly. The room on the first floor was a nice size, but had a small shower which was difficult when you're washing your hair as you kept banging your arms/elbows, and the drainage of the shower didn't take the water away quickly enough causing the shower tray to nearly overflow, but a large bathroom. The bed's were terribly uncomfortable and you could feel the springs, I hardly got any sleep. The room was very hot, and when we opened the window it stunk of sewage outside and had no view and was over-looked by other room's windows. We had AC (Air-Conditioning) on all night, which was fine. Also the wi-fi in the room wasn't easy to pick up and majority of the time, I had to stand at the window to get connection, which wasn't very quick or reliable. We went to reception to ask about our new room and moving times, and we viewed it when it wasn't ready, and although it was re-furbished, it still didn't have a bath, which was needed for my mother. After viewing other rooms, we finally managed to get moved to a room on the fourth floor which had both a bath and was re-furbished, but couldn't move in till our third day, so had to have another uncomfortable night's sleep in the other room's beds! When we finally got into our new room on the fourth floor, all of our possessions and cases were moved there for us. When we arrived in the room, there was no electricity, and we had to call for maintenance who sorted it out in a reasonable time. It was very large, had a double bed which didn't bother us, had a lovely bathroom - WITH A BATH - and had very comfy beds, although the third bed was an old mattress and uncomfortable for my mother. The room relates to those shown on the internet, not like the previous un-refurbished room. The wi-fi connected perfectly wherever in the room, the room still didn't really have much of a view, but it suited its purpose and our needs. The Air-Conditioning was very loud and had to turn it off as not being able to sleep, so we woke up roasting hot. Also, we had noisy arguing neighbours at 2am - walls are thin and not sound proof. But a very large and nice room for our last 2 nights. Both rooms and the hotel was very clean and tidy. Both rooms were equipped with a fridge which was useful but prices for food and room service were very expensive. Also, as it was my daughter's birthday, we asked for a cake but was asked for 35 euros for a small chocolate cake for 3 people, so we told them to forget it, which was a shame as most other hotels provide a card or small gift/cake. The breakfast was a nice spread, with a variety of food available. We went for breakfast around 9o'clock everyday, and also when we got down there, there were never any yoghurts left and neither was there ever any strawberry jam. The mini-danishes were very nice, but hardly ever any chocolate croissants left which was disappointing. Eating out: We went to the hotel's restaurant which was very nice for dinner but quite expensive, and had very few people and no atmosphere. There was a wonderful restaurant called Trattoria Pizzeria al Veneria, a minute's walk from the hotel, down the Via Veneria road next to the hotel (as you come out of the hotel, the first road on the right), which was small but had delicious food, good prices and a very friendly and caring atmosphere... definitely recommend! Also a great restaurant by Trevi Fountain called La Fontana di Venere which is in the top ten on trip-advisor which again was very nice food. The hotel has a SPAR supermarket opposite which was very useful for snacks for the room, and possible baguettes for lunches too. The Via Nationale road was a very nice stretch with many shops. The hotel was very near to landmarks such as the Trevi Fountain which we visited most nights, and we walked to the Colosseum comfortably as it was a short walk away. Near to the Termini - for buses and trains, metro too. If you get the 38 bus to Baseggio, it will take you to a large shopping centre with many fashion shops - such as H&M and Zara. We appeared to be mis-lead by the website about the rooms, and was very expensive for what was available and on offer. Overall, a very nice hotel but just hope for the re-furbished rooms. If you are put in a re-furbished room from the beginning you should have no disappointment.", "Date": "April 8, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "2", "Sleep Quality": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "London", "Title": "\u201cGood location but let down by average rooms\u201d", "Author": "UK-Based-Explorer", "ReviewID": "UR126830015", "Content": "From a long walk from the main train station (taxi is better) the location is ideal for sight seeing but the hotel was a let down based on what was advertised.

We would definitely return to this hotel and recommend it to anyone. I emailed the hotel in advance of our stay to confirm the reservation and to request a bigger/quieter room (based on Tripadvisor reviews which indicated that rooms vary quite a bit) as we were celebrating our anniversary. The hotel responded quickly and courteously, and to our great surprise, had a bottle of prosecco waiting for us in the room. Service at the hotel was nice. Check in and out was a breeze, and when we asked for anything, they were helpful though maybe not super friendly. The room was great - one of the largest we've ever had, with a separate entryway with a closet, large bathroom, and spacious bedroom, though perhaps somewhat dated. We were on the fourth floor and it was facing the street, but the double pane windows kept the street noise out at night. There is a small safe (not big enough for an iPad, but our passports, some documents and Kindles fit inside). There's also a minibar, which we emptied out so we could keep our bottled water cold. Only one outlet in the room, which was annoying but bring a plug expander (along with European adapter of course) and problem solved. Bed is on the firmer side but still comfortable. Flat screen TV in the room with only news channels - two in English, CNN and BBC. No clock in the room, which was unusual, but who doesn't travel with their phone these days? My only complaint about the room was the shower, which has to do with European norms rather than the hotel itself. We had a bathtub with a handheld shower head but no shower curtain and only a partial door (blocking one half of the tub). There's a hook to hold up the shower head to stand under (like an American shower) though it doesn't hold it very well. So you just have to take care to position the shower head well and not get water everywhere. Not sure why Europeans prefer this, but we've run into it at other hotels, so when in Rome.... Hotel is in a great location. We walked to the Spanish Steps, Trevi Fountain, and Colosseum (20-30 minutes strolling). It's a 10 minute walk from Termini, which made getting to/from the airport a breeze. Repubblica stop on Line A is 5 minutes away (you can buy metro tickets here and at the newsstand right outside it). The 64 bus stops right in front of the hotel, which you can take to the Pantheon and the Vatican (many buses with useful routes stop along this street within a few blocks of the hotel on their way to/from Termini - H, 40, 117). It's on a big street with lots of restaurants and shops and stores, including a supermarket directly across the street (Despar) where we stocked up on bottled water and fruit and snacks. There's a tourist information office a block away to buy the Roma Pass (consider carefully) and get information. Other hotel services: housekeeping was fine, the room was cleaned, towels replaced, typical toiletries + others on request. There's two computers in the lobby for guest use for free. Free wifi in the hotel, though we didn't use it (nice to unhook from the world while on vacation!). Two elevators in the lobby. Our rate did not include the breakfast, so we didn't try that or the hotel restaurant/bar (too many great places to go to in Rome!). There's also room service, which we didn't use. Overall, this was a great hotel and exactly what we were looking for. One quibble may have to do with the star rating - 4 stars makes me think it's a luxury hotel. I would liken it more to an American 3.5 star, slightly better than a Holiday Inn or Doubletree. All the nitpicky details I provided are meant to provide a complete picture of what to expect.

We were impressed by the location, so very close (walking distance) to the Metro station and main train station (Termini) and to all the sites, especially the Trevi Fountain and the Colosseum and plenty of shopping on the same road, Via Nazionale. We had a large, carpeted room with a balcony on the back side of the hotel, which is what we wanted. It was fairly quiet, which was great, because Via Nazionale is a rather busy and loud street at all hours. The bathroom was huge and very nice! We opted for the breakfast to be included in our rate and we're so glad we did! What an amazing spread...a much better selection then you would get in American hotels. There was everything from eggs, sausages, cold cuts, breads, pastries, especially loved the croissants filled with Nutella. Plenty of drinks - coffee, different selections of juices and a fruit spread! The breakfast room was packed every morning, it didn't matter what time. We never went for dinner, so we're not sure on the quality. The room and hotel had free WiFi, which was rather important to us, because we wanted to surf the internet on our down time, along with research places to eat and see via TripAdvisor. The staff was very friendly upon our arrival and they also booked a private shuttle service for us for the day we were to leave for the airport at 5 a.m. Everything ran smoothly. The only reason we didn't give it a 5-star rating, was because of one minor, but annoying issue. Our hotel room smelled of cigarette smoke, not that someone had smoked in it before we got there, we could smell smoke coming from other floors and from other rooms. Some parts of the day weren't too bad, but mornings and evenings were the worst. I don't know what the policy is for smoking in the hotel - but this day in age, it should be prohibited. We didn't question or report it, we probably should have, but we didn't. The only other glitch we found is when you leave for the day, none of the plugs work. We couldn't figure it out, but we left our iPad plugged in during the day while we were gone, and when we came back in the evening and used the card to get into the room, the iPad sprang to live to let us know it was then being charged.

It was such a disappointment. From the start the service was terrible. The man at the front desk was really rude. Our room was so small our luggage wouldn't fit in it and the bed was in between a single and a double. When we asked for a different room with a full size bed the man we dealt with before refused to help us even after we showed him our confirmation for a full size bed. Then after finally speaking with a manager over an hour later we were moved to an amazing suit. The bell boy was very helpful and friendly and brought us to our new room. He was even more excited about it than we were. We left for dinner and came back to find that our room key didn't work. When we asked the same rude man at the front desk what was wrong he insinuated that we were idiots and that there was no way that was the correct room #, we were not checked into a \"suite\". Finally a half an hour later we learned that we were brought to the wrong room. We should have been given a double room, not a suite. This could have been an honest mistake, but after hearing the jerk berate the bellboy about it, it was obvious he did it on purpose. On our way to the correct room we told the bellboy to let us know if he was reprimanded for the mix up because we would talk to the manager for him since this was in no way his fault. The rest of our stay there was uneventful until we had to leave. We had requested a wake up call at 3am since we had to leave our hotel by 4am. That evening before we went to bed I noticed the same jerk was working at the desk and knew he wouldn't wake us. I hardly slept so that we wouldn't miss our flight. And of course we never received a wake up call. When I asked about it when we checked out the jerk said we never requested a call (not true...I confirmed it twice with two separate employees). I wouldn't spend the extra money for this hotel. At the start of our trip we stayed at the Hotel Quirinale which is on the same street, less expensive, and has much much much nicer employees. It may be a little more outdated but the service is wonderful, plus the breakfast buffet was only $5 extra and was amazing.

While I was in Italy, I spent my time in Milan, Venice, Florence and Rome. I must say, although this hotel was the most expensive all of all of them, by far it is the worst experience. The front desk staff was useless. We waited about 10 minutes before one of the staff actually greeted us. While she was handling our reservation, she was very slow, and actually kept chatting with the other staff members (in Italian, talking and laughing loudly). After another 10 minutes or so, she gave us a key to our room. I had booked a double room online but the room was barely large enough for 1 person. The bed was small, the room was small (almost no room to put our luggage), and the washroom only had one set of everything for us. We thought it was the wrong room so we went back to the reception area to ask. Of course we had to wait another 10 minutes for someone to answer us, and the answer we got was, \"you booked an economy room.\". That was the whole explanation. Personally I don't see the relationship between an economy room and having one set of bath robes/cups/soaps for 2 guests, but I guess she thought it made sense. Secondly I didn't think the economy room of that size was worth $175 euros at all. Anyways, it was late in October that we stayed in the hotel, and the temperature was hovering near 10 degrees Celsius at night. We were sleeping one night and felt very cold, so we called the reception to ask how we can turn the heat on. We then found out they have not turned on the heating system, so most guests just ask for a second set of sheets. But his voice sounded to me as if he was questioning why I was cold. Anyways, this hotel definitely is not worth 4 stars and definitely not worth the price they are selling it for.

Do not stay in this hotel if you are claustrphobic! The lift only accommodated 3 people at once and then it was cramped! We got over the initial shock of rude hotel staff and settled in a very small and cramped room with no air con. Had to leave the window open for air circulation!

Reception very busy again with only 1 staff member. Finally saw him and he looked up our details and said \"yes, breakfast included!\" We said we knew that but the staff wouldn't let us in. He said gruffly \"I let them know it ok\" and shooed us away with his hands. No apology! We returned to breakfast. For the next 2 mornings we were greeted with the same \"Breakfast not included in package\" which started to get on our nerves. No apology just a reply that she did not know everyone who entered the breakfast room! Our experienvce was quite bad considering the exorbitant cost and the rating of 4 stars.

Second problem was when we got to room, which had a nice balcony & was overall quite nice (apart from a massive hole in the wardrobe door) i decided to have a shower and the shower door broke leaving me locked inside! we then had to get an engineer to come up and have a look, which he could not fix and reception staff were very shocked as to why we asked for another room!! the staff were very rude, and kept saying they would find a manager! so we eventually got moved rooms which this time the hole in the wardrobe was on the bottom meaning your clothes were on the floor so a bit pointless, and this room could not pick up the wireless connection that we had to pay for! Beds were rock solid, felt like sleeping on a bed of nails! went down to breakfast the next day only to see COCKROACHES in the food, on the toast table and crawling along the floor, we went to reception once again to at least get the money back for the breakfasts that i had paid for that we would not eat in a filthy hotel! the manager then added incult to injury by offering us a free meal in the restaurant, which did not go down very well!! other numerous problems occured....mainly because there was no manager in the hotel on the weekends so any problem that occured had to wait to be sorted out, there were lots of people complaining about various things. the reception desk was very full most of gthe times!

We decided not to complain and just make do with the broken door however i went to reception to request interenet access at about 1pm adn i was told there are only 20 euro vouchers left and they are expecting a delivery of vouchers, (which are required from interenet access as its run by an extrenal company), and it was suggested that i return later. I asked again at about 8pm with a different recptionist manning the desk, who was very rude and said it wasnt his problem and they would arrive the following day. Due to his hostility i took the opportunity to complain about the shower adn he said he would sent a handy man.

The male staff especially were not very friendly and cooperative, whereas some of the female staff were much more cooperative and understanding. When we entered our room, we were looking for a safe to keep our valuavles. Looking high and low, we could not find it. When we called the reception, they said all rooms had a safe, and asked us to look in the wardrobe or the refrigerator (???). We called again saying we could not find it. When the technician arrived to 'fix' the safe, he looked around and said - 'no safe'. Of course, after a while, the 'friendly' reception called again and gave us two choices - 'we can change the room for you or we can install a safe in your room.' Why would we want to change a room that we have already unpacked in, just for a safe??? ROOM: We were on the 6th floor, and access to the room was like walking through a labyrinth. We had heavy luggage and obstructive steps in the path did not help matters. The room itself was not very big - the day was warm and tha A/C would not operate at ideal temepratures. The bathroom was small, but adequate. However, there was this VERY unpleasant odour that was eminating from the bathroom on and off. Leaving the windows open provided a bit of relief.

First impressions of grandeur with its floor to ceiling glass entrance and respectful reception are deceiving. If you\u2019re the kind of person who expects what you paid for and need air conditioning then this hotel is not for you. The temperature in Rome, bar one day where it was raining (but still very humid), was on average 22-25 degrees. I booked this hotel on the understanding it had \u201cair conditioning\u201d. On arrival I could not work the air conditioning in the room. The unit would not switch on. So I called reception and asked for help. Someone came and told me that there was no air conditioning. I thought surely he is mistaken. This was 11pm at night and I roasting. So off I went to reception and asked and was told \u201cthat they do not have this service\u201d?? I asked why was it advertised as one of the services on their website and why was it listed as a service the hotel brochure in the room and why was there a air conditioning unit on the wall in the room? And all she said was \u201cthat they do not have this service\u201d. As I am one for complaining when it warrants it I told the lady at reception that I was so disappointed at the false advertising the hotel is doing and that I booked this hotel because it advertised air conditioning. The room was tiny, which I can accept as it was well appointed, a good bed and the ensuite was lovely. However when you spend your days sightseeing and come back to the hotel and you have to keep the window open (onto a main busy, noisy road) because there is no air in the room so you can sleep, to me this is not good enough. And to make matters worse, I woke up on my first morning eaten alive with mosquito bites (23 to be exact)\u2026.. or some other kind of bite!!!!!!! Now for you reading this post may think I am being a bit picky, well I feel I am not. I booked a hotel expecting to be able to sleep. I did not spend \u20ac435 for 3 nights of lying awake listening to the road traffic and water flushing down the walls\u2026\u2026yes you read correctly. The hotel has pipes in the internal walls so every time the room above us flushed a toilet, ran a tap or showered we could hear the water rushing down a pipe behind the wardrobe\u2026I kid you not!! To surmise, if you value air conditioning, like to get what you paid for and don\u2019t want to have to leave the window open and risk being eaten alive, this hotel is definitely not for you!!

We chose it for many reasons including its situation, and for sure because we know that Eurostars hotels are great. We thought we booked a four star hotel as indicated on the internet, but it was a nightmare! My husband and I went from surprise to surprise. Let me list the unbelievable events: 1- We requested a paid shuttle from the airport to the hotel. When we got no confirmation, we called them again and without confirmation after 3 emails... Finally, when we got at the hotel, they told us that it was a private cab, not a shuttle, that we had to pay cash right away, it would not be charged on our room as requested 3 times!!! 2- At the reception, while we were checking in, the bell boy took our bags to bring them to the room. Surprisingly, we didn\u2019t see him; we had to go find the room ourselves, and after 10 minutes turning around in a labyrinth floor, we went back to the reception where we\u2019ve been told that our room number doesn\u2019t exist on this floor!!! Then, we took another elevator, this time there was no button that indicates our floor, it goes from 0 to 4, we were looking for the 5th floor: even the employee who was accompanying us could not find our room. Finally, on the third elevator, the button for the 5th floor was a big hole on the elevator\u2019s panel\u2026 We finally found our room, but without our bags. We had to wait for them for 15 minutes. It took us 45 minutes to find it. 3- The room, called a superior room, was a narrow room . The bathroom itself smells very bad, like it has never been cleaned before. It was awful. The reception was trying to convince us that it was the normal standard for a superior room. 4- Again, they gave us another room, on the 6th floor, this time a little bigger than the last one, but we could at least breathe easily, that was the most important after a long day. 5- It\u2019s impossible to order from the room to the restaurant because the restaurant\u2019s phone was out of order; we had to call the reception that was telling us things that are completely different from the menu!!! 6-In the morning, we've been woken up by a loud noise, like a generator (our room had a view on the gargen), from 7AM until we checked out at 2PM. What makes us really mad is that the hotel was very different from the information posted on their internet website. We were not asking for a red carpet, but at least there is a \u201cminimum\u201d that such 4star-hotel should provide.

The hotel reception were friendly and helped us plan rome by pin pointing attractions on the map and telling us how to get there by bus etc. The hotel bar is quiet but nice. The rooms were great. We had a standard Double which was quite small and only had 2 English channels but thats probably me just being picky!. They were clean and bathroom was nice too. One thing I want to talk about is the Breakfast. Not many people have reviewed this so I will. .. The breakfast is American style so you will get normal Sausages (the pork ones not the usual horrible ones you get abroad) you get that weird Bacon thats not like the UK if you know what i mean. You get scrambled egg. Thats all the warm stuff. The cold stuff includes fruit cakes, muffins and cereal. NOW read carefully.. This hotel has the BEST DESERTS FOR BREAKFAST EVER!. I never usually try deserts for breakfast but once I had eaten the hot stuff i wanted something sweet so i tried the AMAZING MUFFINS! They are fresh, they have blueberry on one day, Chocolate on another and then White with Chocolate chip on another. These are the best Muffins i have ever tasted! Not hard.. there very soft and melt in your mouth. So Tasty! Try one youll be amazed! I cant really faulter this hotel as its in a great location.. (the 64 bus that takes you to the Vatican is right opposite the hotel - oh and you can by tickets for bus on the bus..you dont have to buy them from a newsagents like the hotel tell you!).

About a 10-15 minute walk to the Republic Metro stop. And about a 20 minute walk to the main Termini rail station/metro stop. You can get almost anywhere on the metro in Rome, so it is good to be near the Metro. There is also a bus stop right outside the hotel lobby which is nice.

This hotel was the last stop on our 3 week euro vacation and it was by far the WORST hotel we stayed in. My boyfriend and I are troopers and generally are easy going, but by the end of the stay we were so glad to leave. I originally choose this hotel for the location and the cheap price, as we were on a budget. I wish i would have listened to the bad reviews and stayed away. First the rooms were abnormally small, the smallest we had encountered on our vacation, which was ok because we were expecting it and we did book the smallest rooms they had. also the walls were extremely thin, just hope you arent staying next to noisy couple. Next, the air conditioning broke the 3rd night we were there. It dripped from 4am until the next morning when we called to have someone come look at it. We had to leave the room for the maintance man to come look at it. After it couldnt be fixed we were switched to a different room, which was basically a cheaper version of the room that we previously had. It seems that the hotel attempted to upgrade itself but did a cheap and terrible job doing it. i.e. the faucet BARELY reached the sink so you had to turn it on full blast, and the shower head was installed backwards so when you turned on the shower it shot back at you and soaked the bathroom. By far the worst thing about this trip is that after the housekeeping came, a bag of mine went missing, even though i make it a point to clean up the room and organize my stuff before they come. Unfortunately, the bag contained all of my clean underwear, we had just done laundry 3 days prior, and some items i had bought while on vacation. All that was left was a sock on the windowsill. When we went downstairs to attempt to figure out what happened to it, it seemed that we were the ones who were being the nuisance and that we were putting them out. Very unprofessional and not the way to run a hotel. They even suggested that maybe our room hadnt been cleaned!!! i had to \"bother\" the hotel staff because no one would tell me anything and even though they said they would call me in the room, i, on numerous occasions had to call them. needless to say it was never found. Thankfully, this happened at the end of our vacation so we only had to spend a little money on replacing stuff. Now i am waiting until i hear back from the manager to see if i get reimbursed.

I chose this hotel on the recommendation of someone else who stayed there and because of the generally good reviews on trip advisor. First the positives: Great location for walking to many things and not too far from the train station (we were able to walk with our suitcases from the station in about 15 minutes). Rooms okay, generally clean. Negatives: this was a very crowded hotel with many people checking in and out at all times. There was only one staff member at the reception desk most of the time, so you had to wait in line every time you needed to ask a question. We got in from a hot and sweaty train after taking a cruise at around 12:30. We were told we could not check into our room until 2:00. We really just wanted to relax and freshen up because we were so sweaty. They did take our luggage so we could go out and walk around, which we reluctantly did, beacuse we didn't want to sit around. We were told our luggage would be brought up to our room when we came back to get our key. We came back around 2:45 and could check in. We had to wait in a line to get our key and our luggage was still sitting behind the counter. We just said that we would take it up ourselves. There was a restaurant in the hotel, but we never were even told about it or told about breakfast which they offered. The staff just seemed rushed and didn't really care about helping the customer. We had a lot of trouble finding our room. We were on the 5th floor and had to walk through a maze with signs not well marked. Luckily, we fould a maid who pointed us in the right direction. Our room was fine, a decent size, as well as the bathroom. We had a small refrigerator stocked with things, but it wasn't cold. We tried to adjust the temperature, but nothing got cold. We wanted to fill some water bottles to take with us when we walked, but couldn't. I called down to the reception to let them know, and they said they would send someone up. They never did. The next morning when we went to explore the city, I stopped down at the desk and told a girl that we had called last night and that no one came to our room. She said that someone would check it out and get it working today. We thanked her and left. When we returned and went to our room, the refrigerator still wasn't working and we never knew if anyone came to our room. We just gave up at that point. We did ask at the desk about the best way to get to the airport and basically, they pushed their service which costs 50 euros. I saw a sign outside near the hotel about an airport shuttle service for 34 euros for 2 people, and the hotel said they know nothing about that and would not call for me. They said that I had to call from my room, and of course, pay for the call. I did end up calling on my own, and we got an airport shuttle for two of us with all of our luggage for 31 euros (a much better deal). I also inquired about having the front desk print out our boarding passes for us for our flight home. They told us that we had to do that on their computers in the other room for the guests and then e-mail the boarding passes to the reception. Then they would print them out. Well, we tried this and wasted an hour. Of course, I understand everything was in italian, so it was hard for us to read, then we couldn't get an e-mail to send to the front desk. Every time my husband went to ask for assistance, he had to stand in a long line. Finally, he got someone form behind the desk to come help us, but basically he said he didn't know what to do, because he couldn't figure it out either. The only thing we were told is that we could try back at 10:30 that night after the manager had left, because he doesn't like the front desk doing this and printing out boarding passes. We were really angry. Because it would have literally taken them 5 minutes. Then, we went up to our room at around 2:00pm and no one had been there to clean. On our way out again, I waited in a line and said that we did not get maid service. The person didn't really seem to care and lazily asked for our room number. Lucklily, when we got back a few hours later, our room was cleaned. The only bright spot was later that night we did ask a nice girl at the desk about printing our boarding passes and she was friendly and helpful and had no problem doing this for us. Also, the next morning, check out was fine. There was no line and the person at the desk was helpful. Now, I am not a picky person, and as long as I have friendly and helpful service and a clean room, I am fine. One of these things happening wouldn't have been that bad, but a combination of all these things really soured my feel for the hotel. We did have a wonderful time in Rome and like I said the hotel is in a good location and it is generally fine. I just found the overall staff to be very unhelpful and we wasted a lot of time that we shouldn't have had to. Maybe we were just there at a busy time, but they really should have had more staff working there when it is so busy.", "Date": "August 13, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "Calgary", "Title": "\u201cFaux 4 Star\u201d", "Author": "Bella_Donna11", "ReviewID": "UR37319956", "Content": "The lobby of the Eurostars was very inviting with its Faux paintings.

In reality they just dont turn it on to keep cost down. I was told to open a window to keep cool, however being on a very busy street it was too noisy with 27/7 traffic and sirens etc. I was moved to a quieter room which was just as nosiy but after being persistent with complaining they switched the AC on.. kind of !!

The bathroom had a wonderful feature were the guest had a full length mirror right in front of the toilet........Believe me noone needs to see this!

This direct service takes around 25 mins and runs every half an hour; tickets cost approx 11 euros each way, tickets can be purchased at machines on platforms or at the many ticket booths. The Train departs from plate form 2 (Best to ask at ticket booth , incase this has changed) Remember to get your ticket stamped by one of the yellow ticket machines before boarding. We found this a very easy and cheap way to get into Rome the train wasn\u2019t to busy and we managed to get a seat. We also used the train on our return to get back to the airport again no problems brought ticket at the station and arrived on time to catch the flight home. Once at Grande Termini Station we had a short walk on foot to the Eurostars international Hotel, (exit the station and you will see a large area where the buses and taxi\u2019s stop, to get to the hotel you need to walk directly past this area towards the Piazza Navona square and fountain the road Via Nazionale is just of this square, this is a busy main road with many shops, restaurants and bars, most major sites can be reached by foot although there is a very good bus service which is easy to use and stops outside the hotel (stop opposite hotel for Vatican area) \u2013 tickets can be brought at the many newsagent booths along the street. The Hotel The Eurostars has recently been renovated to a high standard of d\u00e9cor the reception area is very grande, the staff were friendly and helpful, the room was clean, quiet and the bed was comfy. (We did request a quiet room on a high floor \u2013 and that\u2019s what we got!)

Places of Interest The main suggestion I would give any 1st timer to Rome would be on your 1st day take a red tour bus from Termini Station , you can travel all round the city getting on and off where every you wish (even if you decide not to get off the journey takes just over 2 hours) the ticket is valid all day and it costs around 12 \u2013 15 euros, your provided with ear phones and have the option of listening to a interesting commentary, this bus is well worth the money and gives you a brilliant idea where all the sites are in relation to the hotel \u2013 if we had done this on our 1st day, instead of are last we wouldn\u2019t have walked around searching for the Colossum for an 1 hour! Another tip I would recommend is if possible choose to visit the Vatican museum on a Wednesday morning whilst the pope is conducting his weekly mass in St Peters Square he normal appears around 10.30, when we arrived (via bus caught from directly opposite the hotel, another option would be to do the red tour bus on this day as it stops directly outside) St Peters square was busy with hundreds of people, we went straight to the Vatican museum (around a 10 min walk from the square) and were able to walk straight in with no queuing! The Vatican museum is well worth a visit we are both in are twenties and found the whole experience really interesting. On leaving the museum the queue was right back to the square with really long waiting times, we even got to see the pope finishing his mass! Also I\u2019d say if you\u2019re planning to have lunch here, walk a little further into the city and save your self some money as the caf\u00e9\u2019s restaurants right by the square were charging silly prices, for not very nice food. Shopping There is a nice selection of shops surrounding the hotel on the Via Nazionale, including shoes, clothing trinkets etc \u2013 There is also a Spar shop opposite the hotel \u2013 handy for a bottle!! There are more well know designer shops including Gap, Gucci, Zara etc in the surrounding streets of St Peters Square worth a look although the prices aren\u2019t that cheaper to the UK. Also the Grande Termini Station has a lower level of shopping, and a Food Hall which is also worth a look , the restaurants in the food hall serve dinner in the evening also. Other Info Rome isn\u2019t over priced when it comes to eating out, you can get a 3 course meal for around 30 euros, all buses cost the same for any route 1 euro. Take a good pair of walking shoes, especially as this hotel is so central to everything on foot. The hotel reception were really helpful, ask them for tea and coffee and they will delivery it to your room (kettle, tea, milk etc which is free), they were also helpful when it came to bus info i.e. which bus number we needed etc There is a Tourist Information booth 500 yards to the left, on the opposite side of the road to the hotel \u2013 which is handy for picking up free maps and other info We didn\u2019t experience any problems while in Rome, it\u2019s generally a safe place Obviously keep all purses/wallets in a safe place (not in back pockets) as there are pick pockets around especially at busy attractions like the Trevi Fountain (which is defiantly worth a visit!) There is a free mini safe in the room for passports etc. Have a Good Trip!", "Date": "April 4, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "4", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "England", "Title": "\u201cClean, tidy, helpful staff.\u201d", "Author": "Anon_Traveller_UK", "ReviewID": "UR14720464", "Content": "The hotel is central and within easy walking distance of most attractions.

The location on Via Nazionale is very good indeed - a short walk from the Termini station and not far to the major sites. You can easily get to the Trevi fountain, the Coliseum and so on by foot although the Trastevere and Vatican are better reached by bus or metro. There are plenty of shops on the street too and restaurants abound. Rome, though, is a tourism factory. I've never been to a place where there are so many tourists - queues and crowds are everywere. And beware the hawkers. We fell for an apparent con at the Vatican - illegal tour guides who say they can get you in and beat the queues.

Once out of the station head for the Plaza Della Repubblica and turn left down Via Nazionale and the hotel is on the left hand side. It was about a 15 minute walk from the station to the hotel.

The bathroom was also in good condition with a lovely shower (just what you need after a long day sight seeing). We stayed with breakfast included, which was served from 7:00 to 10:30 a.m., which meant you could have a lie in and still get breakfast. Breakfast was the usual mixture of continental and English (cold meats, cheeses, scrambled eggs, bacon) along with fresh fruit, pastries and cakes. We would make full use of this and have a large breakfast to last us until afternoon. We didn\u2019t have a dinner in the hotel restaurant as we ate out in the evenings. There are plenty of restaurants in the area in you are willing to explore the side streets off Via Nazionale. I would say that the hotel was in a good location as you can walk to many of the sights and there was a bus service which ran passed the hotel. The service we received from the staff was good.

In Rome, is is common for hotels to call themselves 3/4* and really not be anything like it. This was DEFINITELY a 4* hotel, on par with a very good Holiday Inn/Travelodge. The reception was upmarket and welcoming, speaking Italian, English, French and no doubt many other languages. The lifts were a bit small but ok. The entrance hall is lovely. The rooms are clean and well-decorated, with pristine bathrooms. Aside from one morning with a hot water problem, everything went like clockwork. We were on the 3rd floor, and heard no traffic noise, however because of Rome's horrendous traffic/driving you did get about 3-4 ambulances go past a night, which I quite happily was not woken up by.

There is no shower curtain, only a glass panel that covers half of the tube width so it's impossible to keep the water from going all over the bathroom. The beds felt a little cheap (maybe we were just really spoiled by the super comfortable bed at Trilussa Palace Hotel) but acceptable. And there is some weird construction noise going on throughout the night. Not sure if it was coming from the hotel (they were rennovating the center courtyard) or outside. The hotel is a 5-10 min walk from the Termini. It's on Via Nazionale which is a big street with lots of buses and seemed pretty safe to walk around at night. We didn't eat at the hotel restaurant but it looked REALLY trendy and fancy. Probably would if we had more time to spend there. I spent a lot of time researching on hotels in Rome before I went.

Getting to the hotel: We flew from JFK to Flumicino Airport and took a car service to the hotel, the ride was around 30-40 minutes. We used Rome Shuttle Limousine,www.romeshuttlelimousine.com. They were great, our flight was actually an hour early and our driver was right there waiting for us with a sign and for our return trip he was in the hotel lobby waiting. The cost was 35 euro each way and it was worth it not to have to lug our bags around. The Hotel: The hotel is located half way down Via Nazionale. This is the best thing about the hotel. The location can\u2019t be beat. The entrance and lobby of the hotel are very nice and the staff was helpful at check-in. We arrived before the 2pm check-in and our room wasn\u2019t ready, but they kept our bags for us so we could wander around the city until check-in. The Hotel Room: We had booked a superior room, which had plenty of space. Based on how people described the standard room I think the upgrade was worth it. There was a big bed, mini bar, safe, tv, and a decent size bathroom with a big tub. The bed was on the hard side, but it was bearable. We were on the 3rd floor on the Nazionale side and didn't have any problems with it being too noisy. Food: They had a buffet breakfast at the hotel each morning, which wasn't included in our booking price. It was 15 Euro per person, which seemed a little steep, so we decided to pass on that. Instead would either get pastries, pizza, or pannis at the snack bars near the hotel or near where we were sightseeing and it was a lot cheaper. We typically spent 5 Euro apiece for breakfast including a drink. We ate at the pizza place Ricci Est Est Est around the corner from the hotel. It was recommended by a lot of people, but it didn't really blow me away I would only recommend it if you don\u2019t want to travel too far from the hotel for dinner. We also walked south down Via Dei Serpenti and found several good restaurants, unfortunately I can\u2019t remember there names, they were probably a 5-10 minute walk from the hotel. We also went to an Irish pub on Serpenti on the way back, which was enjoyable. We used the Rick Steves and Lonely Planet guide books to find most of our restaurants. Transportation around the city There are plenty of buses right in front of the hotel and across the street. The 64 goes to most of the sights, but it\u2019s typically really crowded. The 40 is the express for the 64 and was a lot less crowded, that stop was a little further down from the hotel. The 60 is another express bus that goes to the Forum and Colloseum, again that bus is further down from the hotel, but not too far. The Repubblica subway stop is about a 5 minute walk and the Termini station is another few minutes past that station. I preferred the buses when traveling around especially since they were right by the hotel and the subway doesn\u2019t go to as many places as the buses. I had read a lot of things about pickpockets on the buses and subways, but I never felt unsafe. I think if you stay alert, keep your bag close to you, and not make it too obvious that you\u2019re a tourist you\u2019ll be fine. We had purchased the Roma pass, which comes with a 3 day transportation pass good for buses and subway (it also includes entrance to 2 sights (Colloseum, various museums) for 20 Euro. I would highly recommend this pass, we definitely got our money\u2019s worth from it. We also walk to the Trevi Fountain, Spanish steps and some other sights, but I would recommend the buses since you\u2019ll already be doing tons of walking once you get where you\u2019re going. Sights Some of the must sees for me were: the Colloseum, Forum, Vatican Museum (get the audio tour), St. Peters, Scavi Tour at St. Peters, and the Appian Way. All of these places are easily accessible by bus or subway and I highly recommend them all. We never waited in a single line anywhere we went. Going in the off season was great. We also got really lucky with the weather. I believe the temperatures are generally mild around this time, but rain can be a problem.

Must admit were expecting a tiny room but were pleasantly surprised at ths size of the room and the bathroom. Easy to use safe in the room. The only moan about the room was the lack of a view as the windows were chin-height and looked across into an office block across the street. Rome was in the high 30's when we arrived and the air-conditioning worked very efficiently, although we only had it on low at night. The check-in staff were very welcoming. We were aware that there was refurbishment of the hotel and on our first morning someone kindly took us to the cafe across the road where we had our buffet breakfast. Huge choice of food for breakfast served by smiling staff in the restaurant. The only cause for complaint was the assumption that diners at breakfast needed to listen to MTV and there was even a projected image of the programme in the restaurant. Rome itself was wonderful and I think in the 5 days we covered most of the sights plus a few not on the tourist route - Janiculum Hill, Aventine, fantastic wanderings in Trastevere and Testaccio. Found some great restaurants, especially the oldest pizza restaurant in Rome, Est Est Est, which happened to be in a street next to the hotel.

I had to squeeze past the foot of the bed and the table to get to the window (with no view other than a wall) to pull the curtains. It really was a room to spend no time in whatsoever. I dread to think what the single rooms are like. The bathroom was worse. It was about 7 foot by 2 foot. It had a shower at one end, then a loo and a tiny basin. There was no room to lay out any items such as shampoo, soap, shaving cream etc. so I had to keep these in my case! It was so small I had to walk into the bedroom to dry myself down. It was so tiny there wasn't a door on it from the bedroom so it was pretty much open plan. It felt like being in a space capsule.

Unfortunately, when we returned to the hotel after sightseeing, the room that we were moved to was tiny (which I would have been okay with) but the bed was also smaller. I traveled with my mother and on the first night we slept in the double bed with no problem but on the second night we were both falling out of the bed. I asked if the bed was smaller and they insisted that it was not. There responses were so annoying because I could clearly tell that this bed was smaller and I even had photos as well as the experience of falling out in the middle of the night. Any other hotel would have moved us immediately. I met with the manager and explained the problem to him. He insisted the bed was the same even though I had pictures to show the difference. Anyway, he had the maintanence man come up and measure the bed (wasting valuable sightseeing time). The measurement was not really useful because they did not measure the initial bed that we slept in. ON TOP OF THIS, the beds are SOOOOO hard. Inspite of the fact that I had the issue with the small bed vs the larger bed, I would say that the fact that the beds are hard is enough of a reason not to stay here.

My only concern about staying there again would be the air-conditioning, but that may well be a problem everywhere in non-summer months", "Date": "May 9, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Channel Islands", "Title": "\u201cGood location, tiny bed\u201d", "Author": "HVDV", "ReviewID": "UR7391052", "Content": "We stayed here over the Easter weekend 2007 - in retrospect perhaps not the greatest time to visit Rome as several million other tourists seemed to have the same idea! The good: The hotel is well located, relatively close to the Termini rail station (15min walk) and pretty central to many of Rome's main attractions - Trevi Fountain is about a 15min walk, Colosseum about 20mins, Piazza Navona about 20mins, Spanish Steps about 20mins. There are also plenty of cheap places to eat nearby. The rooms are clean and reasonably well appointed (tv, fridge, free safe) and the staff are helpful. A nice touch was the Easter eggs left in our room on Easter Sunday. Our room was also quiet, as it overlooked a small courtyard and not the main road (Via Nazionale, a busy and noisy road) - we could sleep with the window open. The not so good: The reason we had to sleep with the window open was that the room was too warm. It had aircon but we couldn't get it to cool the room. When we asked at reception we were told that the aircon hadn't been turned on yet (too early in the season although it was about 23C during the day) and that you could only heat the room. They suggested that we opened the window instead - glad our room wasn't overlooking the main road! The worst aspect of the hotel was the size of the room and, in particular, the size of the bed. We had opted for an economy room but the travel site we booked through omitted to mention that it was basically a single room - the bed was a very small double. As the hotel was fully booked there was no possibility of an upgrade. My wife and I are both pretty slender but there was little room to do anything other than cuddle in the bed. So a very cozy few days and really no comfortable lounging in our room. Nothing wrong with the room otherwise - it would have been fine for one person but was too small for two. If the bed size was not conducive to a good night's sleep, then the lack of internal sound insulation did not help - the doors seemed to be made with slamming in mind and you could hear all your neigbours' comings and goings through the night. The hotel is also clearly having some major renovation work done - we had to negotiate building work in progress to get to our room when we checked in. That said, they did tidy up and we can't say that there was any real negative impact after that (although the work hadn't been completed by the time we left). The building work meant that the restaurant was out of commission. The hotel had laid on breakfast at a caf\u00e9 across the road (for \u20ac15pp, as not included in our room rate). We discovered that you could save yourself about half the cost by not joining the hotel guests downstairs - just eat at street level as if you were a walk-in customer. Or save even more by taking away (and back to your hotel room) as there is a tax deduction if you do not eat on the premises. In summary: The hotel manages to do many of the basics well but lets itself down on some other key points. If we stayed there again, we would want a larger room and I can't help thinking that, for the price of a larger room, you could do better in Rome.", "Date": "April 18, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "County Durham", "Title": "\u201cGreat Hotel\u201d", "Author": "Del2n", "ReviewID": "UR7303730", "Content": "Great Hotel.

The room was clean, and it was nice to have a tub in the bathroom instead of just a shower. Another plus - the hotel lift was spacious enough to accommodate several people at once. Unfortunately, the hotel's restaurant was closed for construction during our stay, but they had made arrangements for guests to have breakfast at a small cafe across the street. It was slightly inconvenient to have to cross over there, but the food and service was excellent and I thought it was a very good solution to the temporary problem.

It's rare that I write reviews after a trip but I was so disappointed with this hotel that I felt compelled to share my impressions. Firstly, I'm not sure how exactly hotels attain their ratings but I didn't consider this hotel to be of 4 star quality. During my last trip to Rome I stayed at a 2 star hotel a couple of doors down and to be honest I didn't see a vast improvement in this hotel. It seems to me some hotels get extra stars because the lobby looks nice, and that appears the case with this hotel. My main gripe with this hotel was the size of the room - it was tiny. Be cautious: I booked an 'economy' double but the room I shared with my fianc\u00e9e was no larger than a single. Even the porter sounded apologetic (almost embarrassed) about the size of the room when he showed us to it. Against my nature I complained and requested a larger room for our stay (5 nights) but the receptionist insisted that the room was an 'economy' double rather than a single and would not accommodate me. The bathroom, bedroom and bed were tiny but the 'given' for me was the fact there was 1 pillow on the bed. (The receptionist was kind enough to send up a 2nd pillow on our 2nd night!) I did happen to catch a glimpse of another one of the double rooms on check-out and couldn't believe the difference in size compared to the one I'd shared with my fianc\u00e9e. I'm sure our stay would have been comfortable in a larger room but a review reflects your experience at a place, not the potential, and I was not satisfied with my room at all. Moving on, the location is not great but reasonable, anyone who has been to Rome knows that it's full with hotels so finding something more convenient for the main attractions isn't hard. Overall it's hard to recommend this hotel at all because the truth of the matter is I wouldn't stay there again.

After our complaint the very friendly staff gave us a superior room, (for my birthday I guess).

After catching the Terravision shuttle bus to Termini Station, it was a fairly short walk, trundling our bags behind us to the hotel, which we found quite easily. We arrived a couple of hours before our check-in time, but the staff were happy to place our bags in a secure place which gave us a bit of time to explore the local area and grab a bite to eat. We returned to the hotel and the well presented reception area with smart and efficient English speaking staff. We were given a room and the rather over-burdened porter carried our bags for us...and he didn't even pause for a tip! The room we were initially given was a double, but it was tiny. On first glance there didn't appear room to lay our bags out and there was no bath, just a large walk-in shower. We got on with it all the same and started un-packing our stuff. However, within 5 minutes the reception called us to ask if we were satisfied with the room and I immediately told them we would have preferred one with a bath. The girl found that there was one available and within seconds the perspiring porter re-appeared to show us the alternative room. This room was both bigger and contained a bath, so we switched, happily. Following our move, the porter re-appeared with our bags and only paused for breat rather than a tip. The room suited our needs perfectly although the only English speaking channel we could get on the telly was CNN which we soon christened The Doom And Gloom Channel because everything on it was bad news or Saddam getting hanged. We had a room overlooking the small square in the hotel, nothing to see and not much circulation of air but we couldn't otherwise fault the room or the hotel for that matter. It was close to many of the Ancient Roman attractions and close to the Republicca Metro station from where we ventured beneath the Tiber to The Vatican.

The bathroom was fantastic, with loads of toiletries (including a shower cap which is important for us African-American women!) and warm towel bars. There was an in-room safe which could be programmed with your own secret code, so no worrying over passports and such. Only one large closet/armoire and no drawers, but there were shelves in the armoire so we did not have any trouble unpacking. The location was the really great part about the hotel! We walked to the Coliseum on our first day in Rome and it was a lovely walk and only took about 20 minutes (at a leisurely stroll). The subway station was a few short blocks away (and in the middle of a gorgeous piazza). From there, you can get to virtually anywhere you want to go in the whole city. If you prefer, you can catch a bus just across the street from the hotel to Vatican City and lots of other great points of interest. We didn't do the Continental breakfast as they stopped serving at 10 and we are definitely not early birds when we're on vacation. However, we did have dinner at the hotel restaurant and it was ok, not great but certainly not terrible.

Thankfully we found the staff to be very helpful and friendly and most spoke pretty good English. The rooms were very clean and tidy, air conditioning was quiet and the maids were very unobtrusive. Unlike many hotels we've stayed in in the States we weren't once bothered by maids knocking on the door wanting to clean the room, even though on several occasions we had lazy days and didn't leave until 12 noon, yet each time we returned later in the day, the bed was made and fresh clean towels were in the bathroom. Despite being right in the heart of the Historical District, our main room was surprisingly quiet. We did however have to spend one night in a room at the front of the hotel looking out onto the main Via Nazionale road and that was a little noisy for us but then we live in a quiet area in the UK so we find any road noise unusual. Anyone used to city/town life probably wouldn't have been aware of typical city background noise but if you have a choice then request a room not right at the front. The location really couldn't have been better for all the major sites. The Metro is a 5 minute walk away and the main Bus 64 is literally right outside the hotel and if you're feeling energetic you really can easily walk to many sites such as the Colosseum and Forum in no time at all. The only downside is the restaurant which really lets the hotel down.

The room was comfortable and the air conditioning worked well, but the English TV selection was limited to CNN and BBC news. No big deal but worth knowing in case you'd rather watch TV instead of sightseeing. If you have an electric razor, bring your own adaptor. Speaking of sightseeing, the hotel is close to everything, and restaurants are all around. We did take a taxi to St. Peters as it was hot out and a few miles away, but it could be walked if you wanted to. Unfortunately while we were here, the hotel restaurant was closed for renovations, and they had made arrangements with an establishment across the street for breakfasts. The food and coffee were poor, and we went to a Macdonalds the next day instead. Make sure their restaurant is in operation when you book. All in all, we enjoyed our stay at the International Palace, and hope to return to Rome for a week some time in the future.", "Date": "June 26, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "3", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Wayne, New Jersey", "Title": "\u201cNice hotel\u201d", "Author": "Ana_NJ", "ReviewID": "UR3551169", "Content": "It's a nice hotel.

The breakfast was nice. There was even omelet and bacon! well they tried..... But there was plenty to eat, including selection of cold cuts, cheeses, fruits, yogurts, juices, and sweets. Very impressive entrance and attractive and clean common areas. The staff was cordial, but distant. We couldn't check in until almost 1PM We didn't try the restaurant, but there is plenty of places to eat around. We paid 156 Euro for a Double (booked on Venere) at the end of May.

This was not our first choice as based on previous reviews, we had chosen the Metropole. However, builders had caused plumbing damage and after an embarassed wait of 20 minutes and free drinks from the bar, the manager thought on his feet, booked us a taxi and shipped us of to the four star International Palace. Well done manager! Trouble is ... the Palace is at best only a three star. Why? Despite the better neighbourhood, well presented building and lobby, the rooms are very basic e.g a single wooden chair, a T.V that with 50 channels only offers BBC World and poor quality images of CNN is hardly 'international' standard. Previous reviews commenting on small showers are accurate and true. On the other hand, it must be said the room was very clean and beds comfortable. The request for an extra pillow was dealt with quickly and without fuss. Breakfast quality was reasonable and enjoyable (but each to his own) and with some variety. However the seating arrangement was unusual and catered for parties of 9 or 10 (of which there were none) or instead required individual guests to take their breakfast with total strangers - not everybodies cup of tea! Location of the hotel is good for walking to all the sights. It is only about 10 minutes walk from the Termini also. There are several decent bars and restaurants nearby, hence we did not use the hotel restaurant. December was a good time to visit, 16 degrees was pleasant, there were little or no cues at the sights and it was warm enough to eat out. The beggars you read of were not the problem you would expect and a firm 'no' was all that was needed. Rome was good for a 3 night break. Did we get value for money?

There were very few tables that sat 2 or 3 people, most were large tables seating at least 8 or 9. Guests were obviously uncomfortable in that situation.
