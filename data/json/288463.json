Given the unfriendly service we had encountered at the desk, we did not bother to complain, but were thankful to be leaving the next day.

We choose it because we're staff travelling with university students on limited budgets. Students stay in dormitories of 3-6 beds and staff stay in single or double rooms. Although modest in provision with small rooms we take pleasure in the reasonable prices and the location - only 5 minutes from Termini Station - as well as the dozens of small restaurants and pizza bars nearby. Even better are the staff, especially Javed at reception who is immensely friendly and helpful at all times. Breakfast is taken at a corner cafe. Positano is not flash but it's clean and comfortable enough for our (admittedly undemanding) purposes. We'll be staying there again this year and saving money for other more exciting things.

We walked everywhere and never took the train.

The hotel staff isn't the friendliest but were helpful. I had read about guest getting bed bugs and i was very worried about that but I never experienced any bugs. I had paid for a private room with a shared bathroom and the bathroom was very dirty. I don't know why but there were girls staying there that threw away their dirty underwear in the bathroom trash without even trying to hide them. STRANGE! Can somebody explain this to me? For the price of the hotel in the city it is in I think this place is a good value. I would return and I would recommend for my friends.

Close to a supermarket and a metro. But these are the only good things about it. The hostel was dirty and had graffiti and swear words and beer bottle stickers on all the walls. There was hair on the floor, the toilets stank and neither of them had toilet seats. We did not even try and have a shower. The door jam in our dorm room was damaged, it was clear that the door had been forced open/kicked in at some point and the wood was never fixed, just a new piece of metal put there. We were a mixed group of three and none of us felt safe leaving our bags there. Our concerns for saftey issues were ignored by the three members of staff we spoke to and also the manager when we finally found him. After a sleepless night with drunken roommates having a fight in our room at 3am we could not face another minute there - so lost our money on the second one booked (they have you pay before they show you the room!) then when we asked for the money back they refused saying that basically it was a cheap place and that you get what you pay for! Shocking that they expect people to pay to stay in rooms that are like a cell. The manager says he has never had a complaint, but judging from these reviews, that was a lie. Lesson learned, never book a hostel that you do not do research about before! We ended up going to the M & J hostel next to the Lounge Bar, just around the corner and it was total bliss in comparison.", "Date": "October 27, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "2", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cUnhelpful staff and dirty\u201d", "Author": "jab8942", "ReviewID": "UR117094570", "Content": "While staying here we got bedbug bites and a girl down the hall also did and we found the bugs on the mattress.
