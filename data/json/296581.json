The hotel is 30 minutes by taxi from the international airport serving Istanbul. Overall, this is a small, neighborhood hotel just off the lively Taksim Square in downtown Istanbul. It is NOT a business hotel, so under normal circumstances I would not recommend this facility. But it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s quirky and cute, and after a while it suddenly feels like home. The first problem you will have is getting here. There are several Star Hotels in the area, and taxis will take you to all the better-known and wrong ones. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the best way to do this: Step 1: Tell the taxi to take you to the Marmara Hotel, Taksim Square. Everybody will know it. (It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s also the nearest Starbucks.) Step 2: The traffic in Taksim Square flows only one-way, so the Marmara Hotel will come up on your right. Go past the Marmara Hotel two small streets, probably not more than 75 meters, past the Bank on your right. At that second street, turn right. Step 3: Go 150 meters down the hill and look for Star Express Hotel to be on your right, behind a small park. Take the right-hand turn down a very steep, spiraling road to the front door of the hotel. Whew! You\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re there. (Alternatively, if you are not heavily burdened with luggage, simply get out of the taxi at the Marmara Hotel and walk 100 meters down the side street immediately adjacent to the Marmara; it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s easy.) Now that you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re here, what will you find? A very cordial and welcoming staff, although English will not be their strongest skill. But they will check you in briskly, whisk you up to your room, show you the view of the park and be smiling the entire time. Please note: there is NO handicap access to this hotel; if you can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t climb stairs, you can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t get in. The Star Express Hotel is a world of small. There only are four rooms on each floor, and there are only seven floors, so it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s never crowded or noisy. The lobby is small; my head almost touches the ceiling at one spot. The elevator is smaller than an old British phone booth; it holds three people in a pinch, barely. But, if you are lucky like me, you will be jammed into the elevator with a Turkish beauty with a lovely smile, and you won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t mind one bit! The breakfast room also is small \u00e2\u20ac\u201c 12 tables perhaps? \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and the breakfast buffet is small but sufficient. (Olives for breakfast? It works!) Oddly, there is a flat-screen TV in the breakfast bar that shows Turkish music videos 24-hours a day; all of the staff is watching it and practicing their dance moves, so don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t even think of switching it to the BBC to find out what\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s going on in the world. The rooms continue this Disneyesque them of a small, small world. The rooms are cozy. The TV is tiny, and the desk where I am writing this is the smallest piece of furniture I have ever used. The A/C doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t kick in until the temperature rises above 25\u00c2\u00b0C, so I opened the window and listened to the burbles of the city. (My room faced on to the park at the front of the hotel.) The bed was comfy and the bathroom towels were arrayed on each bed in a very attractive manner, so clearly their staff is looking to do the best they can with what they have. The bathroom is a bit of a problem. It is functional but tiny; you need to close the door to use the toilet. My shoulders are as wide as the shower (no bath tub in my room), and I kept bumping the handle for the hot water with my backside, making the water run cold. There was some mold in the shower and a glass shelf over the sink upon which I bumped my head every time I brushed my teeth. Hey, for $80 in one of the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s greatest cities, you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re not going to get the Ritz. Another minor problem was recharging my laptop. Electricity is a bit scarce in these older buildings, so I had to unplug the mini-bar between the beds to find a plug for my computer. To keep the email running, I slept with the power cord running from the mini-bar going under my pillow and on to the laptop on the desk (see photo). The wireless is free, reasonably fast and easy to log-in. That being said, it all works just fine. Just don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t plan on having a meeting in your room, or a party. You simply won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t fit. One final important point: just off Taksim Square is a massive shopping and restaurant district; it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the broad, bright and car-less Istikial Avenue. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a wide, steeply-sloped boulevard that extends from Taksim Square downhill past the Galata Tower right to the waterfront on the Golden Horn. There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a cute tram that trundles up and down the Avenue, with people jumping on and off (see photo). On most afternoons and nights the Avenue is full of families, friends and lovers. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s clean, bright and delightful, and an easy walk from the Star Express. Don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t miss it. Overall, I think the Star Express is a charming, quirky and affordable hotel in a great location and I will stay here again.", "Date": "April 1, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Ankara, Turkey", "Title": "\u201cGreat location, clean rooms\u201d", "Author": "ilgins", "ReviewID": "UR121977995", "Content": "Very nice hotel.

The reception staff were friendly and efficient and had good English. The room we stayed in was 204 and it was immaculately clean and nicely decorated which gave it a mice ambience. The beds were like soft clouds and just seemed to wrap around you, we got some great sleeps while there. Despite some reviewers complaining about the breakfasts, we found the breakfast to be excellent and there was always plenty to go around and the plates were always refilled.
