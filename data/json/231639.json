{"Reviews": [{"Content": "Excellent hotel My wife and me stayed at the Rafaelhoteles Pir\u8c29mides for four nights, we took the decision based on the comments and reviews that we found before on tripadvisor's website -which where, in general, very good.The hotel fully met all our expectations. First of all, its important to say that it is very well located, very near to the Pir\u8c29mides metro station. In just a couple of minutes, you'll be right in the center of Madrid.We liked the hotel's infrastructure very much indeed: rooms are big, bathrooms are very well equipped, the bed was very comfortable. Breakfast was absolutely delicious! and the staff was always very friendly.", "Date": "Jan 7, 2009", "ReviewID": "UR509903599", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "JFMStuttgart_Germany"}, {"Content": "Great find I stayed at this hotel for 3 nights. Its very modern, with a great location adjacent the Piramides metro station , which is around 4 stops to the centre of Madrid. The hotel was very clean with good size double room including large sliding wardrobes with plenty of space. The breakfast room is on the 1st floor and there was a reasonably good choice of hot and cold food.There are a few bars and small restaurants in the vicinity but we elected to dine at night in the hotel. The meals were very good - I recommend the menu of the day at 18 euros which includes 3 courses, coffee and wine/beer.As we arrived on a Sunday morning , went staright to the Rastro flea maret 3 stops up the line at La Latina - its a must for bargains and quite safe given stories I have heard about pickpockets. Used a metro/bus ticket for getting around as its only 6 euros, whilst I also used a cab to the airport which was 28 euros for 2 people. Enjoyed Madrid - and the hotel in particular. However note that not everyone speaks English, although they do in the hotel and staff are quite helpfulOne tip -dont go to the Faro tower at Moncloa which gives a view over the city -its closed for refurbishment.", "Date": "Sep 14, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR214617493", "Ratings": {"Service": "-1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "-1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "5", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "-1", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "cherokeeWorcester"}, {"Content": "Bring your earplugs The good points about this hotel is that it is clean, modern and snack bang next to the metro and Cercanias stations making it great for getting around Madrid.The breakfast is very comprehensive and reasonable value for 12 euros for an al you can eat buffet. . Dinner was good if a bit on the expensive side.The downside was that the hotel was very hot. My room was boiling and the air con only blew hot air. You could not have the window open at night because of traffic noise so it made for an uncomfortable night.In addition, the walls are paper thin and you could hear every word being said next door so bring your ear plugs!The price of the hotel is very reasonable, so if all you are intending to use it for is a bit of a crash pad then I still think its good value for money despite a few problems.", "Date": "Apr 4, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR173916137", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "3", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "mad4travel"}, {"Content": "Madrid Hotel The location of this hotel is right next to the Piramides metro stop.

Service was perfect, everyone at the reception was very helpful and spoke fluent english. They booked us for the one of the best flamenco shows and we really enjoyed.

This hotel is O.K., if a little soulless. It's right next door to a metro station, very close to Athletico Madrid's stadium and within about 10-15 minutes walk of the Royal Palace. Rooms are clean and well furnished in a bland sort of way, but the biggest problem is the soundproofing (or lack of it) - I could clearly hear all conversations which were taking place in the room next door to mine - luckily my neighbours didn't keep late hours. On the plus side, the staff are helpful and friendly, the breakfast was fine and it's not over the top price-wise. Although on a main road, the double glazing effectively sound-proofs the room from the traffic - just a pity they couldn't have done likewise internally!", "Date": "Jan 10, 2005", "ReviewID": "UR747737309", "Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "3", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "Bad Hotel r me"}, {"Content": "Excelente relacion Calidad Precio, Ubicaci\u8d38n muy buena   showReview(18572068, 'full');", "Date": "Aug 3, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR399311291", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "fye"}, {"Content": "Sehr gut geeignet f\u7709r einen Kurztrip nach Madrid   showReview(17441772, 'full');", "Date": "Jun 19, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR940953150", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "4", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "lass="}, {"Content": "Gerne wieder   showReview(17441758, 'full');", "Date": "Jun 5, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR546532145", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "4", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "lass="}, {"Content": "Gute Wahl   showReview(16592712, 'full');", "Date": "May 29, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR444436340", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "5", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "lass="}, {"Content": "buon hotel   showReview(15574328, 'full');", "Date": "Apr 30, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR212598768", "Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "4", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "lass="}, {"Content": "davvero soddisfacente   showReview(15574326, 'full');", "Date": "Apr 10, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR166460519", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "4", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "lass="}, {"Content": "Je le conseille sans h\u8305siter   showReview(15574327, 'full');", "Date": "Apr 9, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR150894509", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "4", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "lass="}, {"Content": "Super Hotel, immer wieder!   showReview(14736177, 'full');", "Date": "Mar 20, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR104340162", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "5", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "lass="}, {"Content": "Pratique pour visiter Madrid mais un peu excentre   showReview(14736176, 'full');", "Date": "Mar 11, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR703088402", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "4", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "lass="}, {"Content": "Direct Metro Access Secured Parking Great Dinner   showReview(13201591, 'full');", "Date": "Jan 11, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR908480977", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "4", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "lass="}, {"Content": "Bon h\u4e48tel pour visiter Madrid   showReview(11312706, 'full');", "Date": "Nov 20, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR800467886", "Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "4", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "lass="}, {"Content": "Ist sehr zu empfehlen   showReview(11312705, 'full');", "Date": "Nov 1, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR581896928", "Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "4", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "lass="}, {"Content": "un ottimo albergo nel centro di madrid   showReview(11660254, 'full');", "Date": "Oct 28, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR200380303", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "5", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "lass="}, {"Content": "3 stelle?
