This was a once and a lifetime trip for me and all was great until our last day in Rome. Upon returning from a day of sightseeing I discovered that my brand new I Pad and my I phone were stolen from our room. It is customary to leave the key with the front desk so I knew it had to be an inside job. At first the front desk guy (family of the owner) was very angry and insistent that this was not the hotel's fault. He made up a ridiculous scenario of a stranger coming in, walking behind the desk, and getting the key for my room. Well, how would they know I had these items? Only the staff would know this. Basically the owner called and promised that the insurance would pay me. I had to sit in an Italian police station for over an hour to obtain a report. For what? It's now been 4 months and even after repeated communication on my part, I have heard nothing from their insurance. So I'm out the I Pad, I phone, and the Otter Box protectors for both.

A few metres from the hotel there is a \"forno\", a bakery serving excellent pastries just in case somebody wants to wake up late and misses breakfast (the usual plain self service buffet: white bread, sweet pastries, spreads, cornflakes with milk, tea and coffee varieties, juices) The street has a fountain you can refill your water bottle with fresh water. In the street there are many small studios where clothes or accessories are sold. In the direction of Campo di Fiori there are many tavola s where many locals get together, it really isn't a place many tourists get lost. Had a bed in the third floor: the steps are ok for me but I'd request older guests and families to get rooms in the first floors.

Great bed, comfortable matress, always clean room - is cleant before 11 h - towels are not changed everyday but if you put the dirty towels on the bath room floor they will be exchanged. I loved the access to the main streets and tourist-attractions. For example Via Vittorio Emanuelle II leads to the Vatican if you want to walk straight. There is also a Carrefour supermarket on the Via V Em. II !!! Or Piazza Navona is a 3 minutes walk away, Campo di Fiori is 2 minutes away. The Pantheon isn't far also! There were many occasions I prefered walking than taking tourist buses because of the density of hotspots! But there was a downside, the owner is quite moody and appeared to me as a tense, unfriendly person who couldn't handle guest's requests or complaints.

At night it was also very noisy even though we all had rooms facing the courtyards: The airconditioning of a restaurant next to the hotel was running at high speed and noise all the time. The courtyard was also used as a storage for crates which led to further noise when the staff of the restaurant banged the door or got new bottels from there.

It's just around the corner from Campo de Fiori and within easy walking distance of most of the sights. It's a fairly basic hotel, but for the price we paid (140 euros a night) it was perfectly adequate: very clean, everything worked fine (especially the air conditioning, which was vital!) and the reception staff were helpful. Our room was on the third floor and there's no lift, so if you've got problems with stairs, I'd ask for a room on a lower floor. Having said that, being at the top and at the back of the hotel meant it was very quiet. The breakfast room was very pretty & breakfast was the usual continental - rolls, pastries, coffee, juice and cereal. But all very fresh & delicious (the fact that there was a bakery practically next door may have had something to do with that!). We're planning on going back to Rome again at some point, and would definitely stay at the Hotel Pomezia again.", "Date": "July 4, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Service": "4", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Seattle", "Title": "\u201cGood Hotel, Good Location\u201d", "Author": "kh80", "ReviewID": "UR4599183", "Content": "We stayed at Hotel Pomezia during the summer of 2005 and really enjoyed it. Nothing fancy, but clean and great AC which was a major bonus during the hot month of July! The location was great and we had no problem walking everywhere from the Colliseum to the Vatican and there were plenty of places to eat and get ice cream right there. The guy (presumably the owner) working there was fantastic, both of them are really nice and went out of their way to make sure we had a good stay. Breakfast was huge and we usually just grabbed something to go, but you definitely had enough to choose from. We made reservations through a travel site and saved a ton, something like 50% off what the normal high season rate was, so look around and if your dates are secure you can really get a good deal on this nice, clean, comfortable hotel with a very friendly staff and a wonderful location.", "Date": "March 10, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "3", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Washington DC, District of Columbia", "Title": "\u201cExcellent location, good service\u201d", "Author": "worldlywahoo", "ReviewID": "UR4591638", "Content": "We just got back from a trip to Italy and spent three nights at Pomezia. You cannot beat the location. It's on a small cobblestone street with tons of character just a few blocks from Campo d' Fiori, where there are restaurants, bars, gellaterias, etc. This was the big selling point for us. The rooms are not huge, but they are super clean. The bathrooms are large, also. I think it really depends on your luck as to what type of room you will receive. Friends we traveled with got stuck with a pretty bad room. Once they asked for a better one, the management moved them to a larger room with high ceilings, nice decorations, etc. Our room had a small balcony that overlooked a courtyard. Like another poster said, the walls at this hotel are pretty thin, so you can hear other guests as they call down the hall to their pals. But it wasn't too bad. Plus, you can't beat the free cappuccinos in the morning. This is not a four-star hotel, but for 100 Euros a night, it was perfect for us. We stayed at a \"nicer\" hotel (with TV, free internet access, etc) on our last night in Rome, but the location was just not as good as Pomezia.", "Date": "March 7, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "4.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Cambrdige, England", "Title": "\u201cWonderful Location\u201d", "Author": "Donnavaughan", "ReviewID": "UR4578919", "Content": "The main advantage of this hotel is its location.

The staff is exceptionally friendly and helpful, and the hotel is on a relatively quiet street close to some of the best sights and down-to-earth eating places. Rooms have new bathrooms, lots of hot water, and A/C is available (extra; we didn't need it). There's no TV. The only drawback is the noise from other guests - walls and doors are thin, the hallways are inexplicably tiled rather than carpeted, so you hear all comings and goings. To make matters worse, the hotel suffers from affordability :-) so you get school groups of screaming teenagers etc. In the end it feels more like a hostel with separate bedrooms than a hotel.", "Date": "November 5, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "4", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Lancashire UK", "Title": "\u201cExcellant location\u201d", "Author": "redmatty", "ReviewID": "UR4001801", "Content": "We stayed in this hotel for 3 nights in early oct.Fantastic location, could not have been beaten.Walking distance to all main attractions and in an area surrounded by great value restaurants and bars.
