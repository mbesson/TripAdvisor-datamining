We've stayed in Sultanahmet many times with varying degrees of satisfaction. Price does not always equal quality and as this was just a quick trip we chose the Modern Sultan due to it's location and cheap room rate. The room was very small which in itself is not a problem but this is the first hotel I've stayed in ever where there was no television in the room or soap provided in the bathroom. There are a couple of small bottles of nondescript liquid but that's it. Our room was unfortunately situated at the top of the stairs and above the entrance to the hotel which allowed us to hear all the comings and goings inside and out. Unfortunately there was also no hot water on our first morning. Which I could have braced myself for had we been told, but we weren't until standing there waiting for it to heat up for several minutes clothed only in my towel I decided to ask reception to be told that it had stopped working the night before and should be fixed today - which indeed it was, fortunately! The breakfast was nice. Not a huge variety but typically Turkish with lots of vegetables, cheese etc... The staff are also very friendly (I believe it's family run). So on summing up...If only our room had hot water, a tv and soap. Basic things that make all the difference when you've got so much competition at your doorstep. Indeed there is a hostel right next door which is cheaper and has bigger private rooms - next time!", "Date": "March 8, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "2", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "1", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Shanghai", "Title": "\u201cRoom 402; not a good stay due to the noise\u201d", "Author": "JerseyInShanghai", "ReviewID": "UR123189397", "Content": "This should be a very nice hotel, but we had two major problems. Our room was almost but not quite finished with a renovation, so the paint smelled, the radiators needed fixing, the curtains were missing and the floors were barely covered by the rugs. They probably should not have given us the room due to the unfinished work. They staff were, however, very nice about trying to address these issues. The much bigger problem was the noise. Next door is a hostel which had a lounge on the top floor. Our room was one floor below, and faced this lounge. There were very loud parties every night until 1 am. You could hear the conversations distinctly and sing along to the loud music. I could hear the music in the hallway of the hotel down to the third floor, so if you stay here, I would ask for a low floor that does not face the back of the hotel. It's a shame because the other facets of the hotel were nice. Our family room had two rooms, one with a full size bed, another with two twin beds. The two bathrooms each had toilets, sinks and showers, although one had a very cramped shower. Soap and shampoo is provided. The room also had a chair, a dresser and a rack for towels. The room was a little cramped. It has a great view of the Ayasofya. The location is great since all of the Ayasofya, Blue Mosque, Topkapi Palace, Cistern and tons of shops and restaurants are within a five minute walk. Other items included were free wifi and breakfast. Breakfast was cereal, fruit, bread, cheese and meat, and toast with veggies and cheese on top.", "Date": "January 17, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "NJ", "Title": "\u201cGreat location\u201d", "Author": "djdrs", "ReviewID": "UR120602427", "Content": "Great location for visiting the major sites of the old town, very convenient to the tram line as well to get to modern Istanbul and to the trips on the Bosphorus.

However, you will probably find many other hotels with similar location advantages in Sultanahmet. The difference for me was the atmosphere inside the hotel itself. As some reviewers have mentioned, you get the feeling you are very welcome and at home. We stayed in a double room which just had a bed with no other furniture, but the bed was very comfortable and the decor was very nice. The owner and staff are friendly and always helpful. They always gave us tips where to go or what to eat, and even lent us utensils to cut the fruit we had bought. The bathroom was tiny and the fan a bit loud, but we didn't mind. We have only two negatives to say about the place. 1) Rooms are not sound proof at all. You can hear footsteps outside and when someone is walking up/down the stairs, if you stay in the first level you can even hear the chatter from the reception which can be a bit annoying. 2) They had some maintance work done in the hotel during our stay, we didn't' hear any noise but one day I stepped out and a tool fell from the construction staff just outside the entrance. It wasn't a close to hitting me but it could well have did. Overall, I highly recommend Modern Sultan hotel!
