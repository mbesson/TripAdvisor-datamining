After reading the reviews both here on Trip Advisor and a few other sites I was skeptical about the place. Check in was fast and efficient. Porter met us at the cab and tried to take our luggage (we only had carry ons so not necessary) and help us to our room. We declined. When we got to the room we were pleasantly surprised by the cleanliness and the size of the room. We had a room with a king bed and there was a small sofa in the room also. There was plenty of room in the room for two people to manuever without running into each other. There was no top sheet on the bed but I called housekeeping and one was provided immediately and was put on each day after that. There was a very nice blanket in the room - despite what the other reviewers said - and even and extra comforter in the closet. The bathroom was huge by hotel standards. It was a little dated - old fixtures - but in good repair. There was a small tub and shower and a huge sink area. The only problem when we got there was they only provided two large type bath towels, no hand towels or wash cloths (not many hotels in the Middle East provide wash cloths even if you ask) again I called housekeeping and they immediately brought us hand towels and again provided daily afterwards. The water pressure was horrible but was enough to take a shower even an extended one to make up for the lacking pressure and the hot water lasted the entire time, even though the second shower. There is a restaurant on site but did not eat there - mostly Indian and Filipino food. There are plenty of places within walking distance to go to also. City Center mall is only a short taxi ride away (we paid 10 AED for the trip there) and it has a lot of places to eat also. The Metro station is very close (about a 5 minute walk) and goes to everything in the city (even the airport!). There is a bakala (store) about a minute from the hotel and carries everything you might of forgotten or need (such as soda, instant coffee, etc., etc.) We were on the 7th floor and never heard any noise from the night club our entire stay. We did not go there so cannot tell you if it was as bad as the other people say it is. If you don't like that kind of thing stay away from it. Overall I say it is an okay hotel lost in a city with many luxury hotels. It is a little dated and needs some work but if you are looking for a cheap place to stay in the heart of the city then you might consider this one.", "Date": "January 26, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Sleep Quality": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Brisbane, Australia", "Title": "\u201cJust Terrible\u201d", "Author": "potkan", "ReviewID": "UR123092212", "Content": "My parents stayed in this hotel recently and asked me to write a review to warn everyone who might want to stay in this hotel in spite of the other poor reviews.

The place is so spread out that you need to take transport where ever you stay, taxis are frequent and numerous. Two downsides to the hotel, the first was lack of hot water, the hot tap only supplied luke warm water and the reception seemed to be not fussed to fix it. By far the biggest problem are the night clubs on the lower floors, They are nothing more that auction room for south Asian sex workers, the men who attend the clubs bid for the girls over the course of the evening. Watching this was nothing short of distressing, the girls sit on a long bench at the back of the stage and take their turn to dance in front of the men over the course of the night, while the men place bids. If the girls want to leave the stage for a drink they must ask permission. The girls seem to be indentured to the club.

(the company which I work for) who traveled to Dubai to visit GITEX exhibition on October 2008. It was an organized tour and paid by company, so I have no exact information regarding the price. The Orchid Hotel Dubai is a decent 3* hotel but in a good area. It's not acutually luxury; it's just a cheap (relational to prices in Dubai) place to stay and sleep for few nights. If you're on business in Dubai for maximum one week and you're looking for a budget hotel then Orchid is a good one. The noise problem that many users mentioned in this forum is still there, but mostly for the 2nd and 3rd floor. Our room (me and my colleague Maziar) was in the 4th floor and we could hear only a weak sound from night clubs in the first floor. The hotel serves buffet breakfast and lunch included in its price. The number of choices is not bad and foods are acceptable. The rooms are really small, but clean. The pool on rooftop is actually very small, not should call it a pool! The lobby is small in size and very decent. Taxi is a real problem in Dubai these days, and this hotel can't do anything for you too.

My room was nice and clean on the 5th floor, but the water was really hot so I turned on the cold water to neutralize it but to my surprise it was hotter, so I rang the concerned department and they switched off the boiler. I had to wait for an hour for the water to cool down. This exercise had to be done very morning and after a certain while I started feeling like boiled meat. It was certainly cumbersome to wait for the right temperature water to come so you could take a shower so inevitably risks had to be taken. Otherwise the staff was very polite and hospitable.
