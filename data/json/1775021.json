The fridge in the room contained complimentary drinks which was fab. The bed & pillows were very comfy, even my girlfriend found them just fab even though she is pregnant. The honesty bar downstairs was a fab idea & a real surprise. The breakfast was great as was served between 9-11, which suited us. Each morning we were given something different with our breakfast as a special treat, which was a nice touch. The owners were very helpful all the time, carried bags up/downstairs, recommended places to eat each night which each time were great. They told us about all the sights of Amsterdam & where they were by putting them down on a map for us. The time we were there was for my girlfriends 30th birthday, so I made a special request before I went to have balloons, flowers & chocolates in the room which was done, I cannot fault what they picked as it was to my standard, just fab. I would defo recommend this hotel to one & all, just book it now.

Are there negative things you can say about this place - well of course nowhere is perfect. I would have liked an extractor in the bathroom and the hand towels are kind of small but then hey that's really nitpicking. What makes this place stand out are Berry and Marcel. Nothing is too much bother for them. They'll take your bags up and down to your room. Recommend and book you restaurants and fast track entry tickets to museums. Breakfast is almost a piece of performance art as you head downstairs wondering what Berry's little surprise treat of the day is - we had fresh pineapple, Dutch pancakes (natch), fresh fruit and yoghurt and beautiful Dutch pastries. There is a great collection of DVDs and CDs to watch/listen to in your room if the weather closes in, the most reasonably priced honesty bar anywhere in the world and of course the welcome drinks in your room when you arrive.

And the friendly and courteous staff is a HUGE asset. Our room was large with a fantastic, postcard-perfect view of a canal outside our large windows. And what other place offers you a one-night complimentary mini bar?! Unheard of.

We were greeted by Berry, he helped us carry our bags up to our room. And left us to settle in. There were drinks free in the fridge. We asked for a restaurant recommendation. It was perfect. We had left 5 children behind and we were able to kick back and totally relax. The hotel was so peaceful. Lovely music in the honesty bar. The location was perfect, no traipsing for ages from the train station to find your hotel. You are in the red light district but very easy to avoid if you wish. The area seemed very safe. We did a lot walking, it was always easy to drop back to mauro with your shopping bags or to get changed for dinner. You can purchase wine, beer and snacks at the Honesty bar if you return home late and want something. We borrowed some of the DVD's and had a bottle champagne. We stayed in courtyard room at the top of house. We no problems with street noise. To be honest, after all the nice meals out we needed a little extra exercise, so the stairs wasn't an issue for us. Staff were extremely friendly and helpful. They run a lovely business with some extra special little touches. Breakfast was great, really set you up for all the walking we did. There was really nice coffee avail to take away too. The beds were really comfortable. You can control the heat in your room if got cold. The only fault we found was we thought there should have been extractor/ventilation fans in the bathroom. And the towels were a little smaller than standard bath towels.

My room was massive and nicely funky decorated..bathroom fanstastic, with a separate shower and a massive bubble bathtub..all the toiletry were nice and well layed out. On my bed, there was some welcoming chocolate and instructions of the hotel. The free mini bar came very handy..and gosh, the prosecco were sooo nice and refreshing. Did not have time to taste much of the breakfast as it starts at 9am and i had to leave for work at around 8am..but Berry made it handy for me to grab something to eat and drink in the morning. Their selection of drinks and snacks with the honesty bar is very good if you fancy something in the night. The hotel is soo well located: 2-3mins walk from central station, restaurants and bars are all nearby. Although it is close to red light district, it is a safe area to walk at night time. On my last day,there was no train to Schiphol airport, and Berry gave me all the info for public transport to get there,as taxi was a minimum of \u00e2\u201a\u00ac50!!!

Two slight gripes - the lockers were short so my husband's clothes were squashed and as it was above the breakfast room we could often hear music, not really an issue but slightly annoying.

One tiny wardrobe as well to store your stuff.

I booked the reservation based solely upon its Trip Advisor recommendations, and I am once again happy to report that this community did not disappoint.

It was easy to come in by train and ditch my bag. As I had to catch the train to Schiphol for a 9am flight, it was very easy to get back to the train in the early morning, and most importantly it felt quite safe. \u00e2\u20ac\u00a2 I arrived on the day of my stay at around 11:00 am. The hotel proprietor generously still offered me breakfast at this late hour. While my room wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t yet ready they gave me a city map, restaurant recommendations, and a room key. When I returned after sightseeing later that day they had already moved my bag into my room for me. \u00e2\u20ac\u00a2 There is strong free wireless signal in the downstairs lobby, but also in the individual rooms. There is a laptop for guest use as well as a books, magazine and movies that can be borrowed. \u00e2\u20ac\u00a2 My spacious canal facing room was huge and just amazingly beautiful. High ceilings, heated bathroom floors, deep soaking tub, contemporary furnishings, mosquito net, and a gorgeous view of the canals. The price was very very good for a room and a view like this. I love the mix of the design elements (like the sleek plastic rocking chair) with the historic elements (like fireplace & cross beams) \u00e2\u20ac\u00a2 Apparently the Mauro building was once a notorious fetish hotel. While you would never know it, they kept little cheeky architectural remainders around. (My room had a rubber floor and a tiny ladder that led to a tiny cage on the roof of the bathroom!) I know it sounds weird but it adds to the design scheme and uniqueness of the hotel. \u00e2\u20ac\u00a2 There were free welcome drinks of beer and sparking wine in the mini fridge! If you finish these the hotel offers a well stocked and very well priced honor bar in the main room, with interesting international selections.", "Date": "February 3, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Philadelphia, Pennsylvania", "Title": "\u201cExceeded very high expectations\u201d", "Author": "My-Life-I-Sought", "ReviewID": "UR123695678", "Content": "We stayed at the Mauro Mansion over New Years after seeing such positive reviews on Trip Advisor.

However, there are far nicer hotels in Amsterdam (the Ambassade, for one!) For the value however, it's great. I suppose it's been so highly rated because of all the little extras, such as an ipad you can use and free welcome drinks. The Philips WakeUp lights are a great touch, however it'd be useful to have a manual (I could only figure it out because I'd recently bought one.) My issues are that no one managed to tell us how (or where) to turn on the heat, so we had to figure it out the hard way the next morning in a freezing bedroom. Typically, when a hotel is expecting guests, you'd think they would turn on the heat for you IN WINTER. Also, the bathroom smelled a bit off for my taste, and a vent would be a wise choice. As is stated on their website, the street level rooms are a bit noisy. What's not mentioned is that you hear everyone that comes and goes out of the building. Most people are respectful though.

The room was pretty spotless (I am a clean freak so am highly critical); service impeccable (they arranged for me to get a much needed massage in my room one evening which I recommend to all with airplane fatigue).Would definitely stay there again; but would also consider staying closer to the Museum District just to avoid the rowdy bands of youths making the rounds thru the RLD.

The hotel is a 2 min walk to the train station, yet is on a quiet street next to a canal.

The Mauro serves up a beautiful breakfast spread (included) and can also print out your tickets for all of Amsterdam's museums while you finish your morning coffee, saving you the hassle of standing in line. You can easily take a scenic walk to all of the city's major sights from the Mauro. It is also right next to the Red Light district which was a concern of mine because I didn't want to be in a seedy part of town. It wasn't a problem at all. The neighborhood is quite upscale and felt very safe, though I wouldn't recommend staying in this area with kids. The Mauro doesn't accept kids anyway. A good policy in this particular situation. The hotel owners, who work there as well, recommended a great local Italian cafe called Oggi. It takes 5 min to walk there from the Mauro and was outstanding. The manager of Oggi is Mossimo. He was wonderful and very generous to my wife and I. We ate there 3 straight nights because of him The food is terrific!! A must do for dinner if you stay at the Mauro! Try his anti-pasta appetizer.

The breakfast is wonderful: hot, fresh breads; platters of cheeses and meats (along with containers of yogurt and other accompaniments in a lovely red refrigerator!); coffees/espresso; and, every day, a special \"side\" treat prepared by Marcel. One morning, he prepared skewers of fresh, mini pancakes alternating with strawberries; another morning, rolled pancakes; yet another, a cup of fresh fruit with yogurt.

While there is free WiFi, the signal is often a bit weak, or at least it was in our room. (We might warn everyone, though, about mosquitoes. That's not a criticism of the hotel, but a fact related to Amsterdam's canals. Use the air conditioning rather than opening the window.) Berry and Marcel were very knowledgeable and helpful about restaurants (we took their advice), and when my husband contracted a cold, Berry knew to direct me to the nearest pharmacy and also helped me decide on where to get a gift for the business associate I would be visiting.

The hotel cheered us up. I'm guessing we had the best room in the place, the one on the left, ground floor, as you enter the hotel. It was large and had all the amenities including a mosquito net. The exposed, original brick wall was a decor delight. The mini bar with complimentary contents was a small touch reflecting the care and consideration of the management. We found Marcel and Berry to be exceptional hosts providing intelligence on everything from where to go, where to eat and what to see. The breakfast was exactly what we wanted, a kind of mini buffet where you might have a little toast, some yoghurt, pretty much the kind of things we might normally eat. We found the honour bar quite useful. A bottle of red wine allowed us a glass each evening before setting out to explore. I didn't know they had mosquitoes in Amsterdam but, with all the rain, they were out in force. We did actually have to sleep under the mosquito net. It was rather fun since years ago I lived in the Caribbean. It brought back fond memories. A couple of minor points. We arrived at the train station in torrential rain that was clearly not going to stop. We had seven weeks travel luggage with us so there was no way we could walk the six hundred meters to the hotel. But no cab driver would take us - the distance was too short. I finally sat down in a puddle and burst into tears until a sympathetic driver took pity on us. The road the hotel is on is not so quiet, it is quite busy. This is only a concern when walking towards the city centre. Be very aware of cars, trucks and, most of all, cyclists. The hotel is on the verge of the red light district which is a bit of a hoot. Walking through at night is a must in terms of people watching and general interest. But you have to walk through it most of the time to get to the main square. My wife, the most broadminded of ladies, eventually found the scene a bit tiresome. Asking her why, she replied that it was all rather sad and that visits to a city should be happy. An interesting point. In summary then, a lovely hotel, wonderful hosts and an enjoyable visit.

Using landmarks as guides to the hotel is really good idea since there are so many streets and alleys. Then again, Mauro Mansion is right by the canal so it's relatively easy to get to. Situated stone throw from the Red Light District(2mins walk if fast-walker), it's surprisingly quiet at night, and the immediate surrounding area seems to be residential and some rented apartments. So the neighbours are safe enough! Marcel was accomodating to my request for earlier check-in at 840(thanks) and when my room is ready, luggage is automatically put into a cage-like clothes rack in the room. Having said that, the rack was probably designed with mainly Dutch in mind(notice they are really tall?). Being 168cm myself, had to stretch abit to hang clothes. Tea and coffee in abundance, complete with creamer and sugar, but the water pot was totally mouldy, and didn't dare use it, couldn't bother to wash it thoroughly. 3 levels of rooms, and staying in room 32, it was peaceful enough(with only 4 other rooms around me) but the sound-proofing is near nonexistent cos it's very clear what the activities and conversation topics were outside my door. Having said that, it didn't happen often, probably thrice in a day(since was out almost the whole day). The decor of the room and the little touches were probably what made this property stand out among the rest. Clad in red, with interesting drawings adorn the wall, a cafe style table + chairs set beside the window overlooking the peaceful canal with swans and geese keeping company. Rate includes two soft drinks, two juices, two beers and two proseccos with flute. Sweet for a canal view room and comes in handy when u just wanna relax with your partner or just appreciate the beauty of Amsterdam. A book \"The UnDutchables\" was in the cupboard should you want to know more about the culture, arts and the norms of Amsterdam society, good for those with some time to spare and a relatively long stay in the city, an check out their collection of novels stacked on the shelf. Welcome chocolates on the pillow adds another surprise. Bed is comfortable and big(queen sized) with seperate duvets, quality is not the \"Dream Bed\" kind like HIlton's, but good enough, and unless you're a Sleep Connoiseur, it's good enough to rest after a day of exploring. Wifi is provided free but signal is suspect at times. Then again, I am on the 3rd level, so. In the welcome letter, states they are huge on recycling and green efforts, but I suppose it will be good if they can provide another trashcan to contain the gass/plastic/paper waste we produce since the hotel encourages this segregation. I had to leave my plastics and glass on the table since there's only one can in the room. Toilet, as the room is, can be termed 'large' by European standards, with underfloor heating(useful in Amsterdam's weather) but smells abit when it's heated. Comes with good choice of bath gels and shampoo. No toothbrush so b-y-o. Bathtub with showerhead, sufficiently large to squeeze in two, but it appears to be quiteworn, so didn't try to do a bath. Water pressure quite weak(lvl 3, reason perhaps?) and takes some use to for the adjustments of hot/cold water. Once you got it, it's fine. Provides hand wash gel, very convenient instead of using soap. Breakfast is sufficient, bread loaves, cold cut meats(x3 kinds), fromage (x6), yoghurts, butter, spreads, coffee/tea are all available, and Marcel brings out fruit yoghurt for everyone. For someone who doesn't like yoghurt, this is something special and is full of fruity burst goodness in every bite! Dunt reject this! In the breakfast room, there's also the 'Honesty Bar'; choose what you want and let them know at checkout or whenever you want to. Not sure if they know should you not report it, but I never tried. Eur6 for a prosecco/white wine, Eur 2 for bit bag snacks and beer is not exorbitant and quite good value pricing for a hotel. Nearby are plenty of eateries, but none stay open till 12, so should you require a proper bite, walk alittle deeper into the RLD and you can find all the kebabs and Shoamar you need. 5 minutes walk to the Centraal station, 7 to the Damrak. They can keep your luggage should you require this service after you checked out.", "Date": "August 29, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Lyon, France", "Title": "\u201cLovely hosts and amazing breakfast\u201d", "Author": "Louis R", "ReviewID": "UR117318719", "Content": "Marcel & Berry and two amazing hosts.

Someone was always at the reception and would welcome us with a smile etc. - Location is very convenient if you wanted to be near the red light district or the central station. We booked a canal view and were not disappointed with the excellent view. The street was not sleazy or too noisy despite its proximity to the red light district (ok, there was a prostitute's window down the same street but this hardly bothered us or anyone in the hotel). - Room was spacious and bathroom well appointed with power shower. The decoration was done in an ultra modern fashion and may divide the opinion - we liked it. It also has air con to keep the room cool. - The fridge was stocked with free goodies as a compliment e.g. beers, juice and even a small bottle of proseco. They weren't restocked (as it was explained) but we were free to use the fridge. - Wifi worked well and a laptop was provided, again free of charge - The honesty bar was very reasonably priced (for Amsterdam). - I wasn't sure about the breakfast at the beginning as it was limited (x3 choices of ham, x2 choice of cheese, 2 types of breads and cereals, orange or apple juice, coffee & tea, fruits) and no hot food or salads. But Mercel made different additional food every day (pancake on the first day, pinapple on another day, apple tart etc) and we were interested to see what next day brings. We also realized we didn't really want a heavy breakfast as the dutch restaurants tended to serve late and we were too full the next day. Cons: - Our room's window didn't open (we thought we can see the next room's open) - Although trams were near by, it was a little inconvenient if majority of the site seeing were in museum, central or western area. Not a huge negative for us as we liked walking through the red light district as we came back to people watch. - As it was a small place a one unthoughtful family can make the place uncomfortable. We were unfortunate to see a family from non-euopean \"english\" speaking country occupy 2 tables and a sofa between 3 of them when everyone else were sharing a table between 2 people. They also hogged the communal laptop and we could not get near it at breakfast or evening time. - The soundproofing was much much better than in british hotel. But on occasion we could hear street noise. We also had a infrequent low buzzing noise coming from inside of the room lasting 1-2 seconds. - There were mosquitoes in the room but this is unavoidable being next to the canal. Mozzy net is provided so not a huge problem. - the stairs are very steep and not for anyone with physical disability. I think there were x2 ground floor rooms though. Overall I would recommend the hotel to anyone that's not easily offended by the near by red light district and not in need of a more quiet sedate canals in less touristy parts of the Amsterdam. It suited us well and would be happy to go back if we go back to Amsterdam!", "Date": "July 22, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "New York City, New York", "Title": "\u201cIn the Red Light District, but not in the Red Light District.

The hotel itself is located about 10 minutes walk away from the central train station, and the furthest we walked to anything was about 20 minutes away, we had two very nice meals at the hard rock cafe, and a place called CAU near to Dam square. The icing on the cake however was the day of our 10th wedding anniversary, we arrived back at our hotel to find freshly cut roses, two glasses and a bottle of champagne with a note to say congratulations on 10 years.

Having never been to Amsterdam, I was a little worried about the location being so close to the train station and the Red light disctrict. Let me reassure you. The location is perfectly fine. We walked, with luggage to MM from the train station without any problems. There is free wi-fi, movies to watch in your room, and a community computer in the lobby. Breakfast is great. Wonderful breads and spreads. Sliced meats, cheeses, yogurts and fruit. The tea and coffee is even fabulous. I felt like they used high quality foods and beverages. I even like the music they played during breakfast. The owners are wonderful. I can't say enough about MM. I would stay here again and recommend this place to everyone. As a sidenote.

Being a regular visitor to Amsterdam over the years I was excited to see the Tripadvisor reviews on this place and it certainly lived up to expectations. Berry and Marcel were lovely hosts, we both loved the fact the service was always there, but was very unobtrusive. Our room was on the first floor with a view onto the canal. it was spacious, comfortable and, for a street facing room, pretty quiet. The bed was comfortable and we slept well for our 3 nights there. Our only niggle was the mosquito net over the bed - it was impossible to tie back fully and kept falling onto us when we were chilling out watching TV. But that's it - the only niggle - hardly major. It's location not far from the train station means there is a little noise from the trains, but not enough to disturb. The location is spot on - just a short stroll from the madness of Dam Square and the red light district, but not close enough to feel engulfed by it. It's also easy walking distance to the Jordaan and Niewmarkt areas. Breakfasts were good (those little pancakes were delightful), and there is free coffee from the machine whenever you want, as well as a kettle and (stocked) fridge in the room. It's not a place for small children - lots of steep stairs/breakable objects, but for couples or families with older children, it's ideal.

The breakfast was held in the back room which still had the original beams from the 16th century and was tastefully decorated with vintage tables and chairs. The food was always good quality with fresh meat's and cheese's with bread so fresh that they were still warm when you cut them. With excellent Tea and Coffee as well what more could you ask for. Mauro Mansion runs an \"Honesty Bar\" which is a great idea as they do not charge stupid money for the beer, wine and snacks that other Hotels do and with your mini bar in the room being complimentory for the initial stock in there this made for a cheap way to have a few drinks before you went out. I could go on forever about how good this hotel is but I will let you find out for yourselves.

We went for Valentines and stayed for 4 days and had the most amazing experience, this was helped by Berry and Marcel who made our stay truly unforgetable....Thank you B&M. The hotel is situated within walking distance from everywhere and is in a great location. It is situated only 5 mins walk from central station (turn left out of the station and keep walking until you see the street, then only 100yds down that street). The hotel has the best rooms I have stayed in (and we are hotel snobs I don't mind admitting) with great bathrooms (bath for two, power showers, sublime bedding, free mini bar, TV if you want that etc), they make you very welcome and can give you any info you need and nothing is too much trouble! The breakfasts keep you going most of the day and if you want you can just chill out in the kitchen/lounge area. I recommend the 'Ciel Bleu' resturant if money is no option as myself and my g'friend went for Valentines but be very warned as you pay a lot of money for this once in a lifetime experience (\u00c2\u00a3400 + for a experience for two), perfect food (9 courses for us), perfect views over Amsterdam and of course michelin class service. On valentines day we had roses, chocolates and a lovely card waiting for us on our return, we added to it with a bottle of Champagne from the 'honesty bar' (great little touch and soooooo cheap)! Berry & Marcel...Please do not change a thing, you have achieved so much and I promise we will be back soon!

Berry & Marcel are the genuinely friendly, helpful owners, who plied us with excellent service and fantastic breakfasts during our weekend stay. The hotel is an easy 5-minute walk from the Central Station (which, in turn, is an easy 20-min train ride from the airport), and located along one of the canals. It is especially desirable to be near the Central Station, because all the trams (which are the easiest, fastest way to get around) depart from outside the station. The hotel's lobby is connected to the breakfast room, where people not only eat, but also congregate and chat. There is a laptop for the guest's use. Breakfast is wonderful - fresh-squeezed OJ, an elaborate coffee/cappucino/latte machine (available - free of charge - all day), delicious and warm fresh breads, cheese/meats/etc, fruit, muesli, yogurt, and even fresh loose-leaf teas with disposable teabags. The rooms' minibars are stocked with 6 free drinks upon arrival (beer, soda, juice), and there is also an 'honesty' fridge in the breakfast room with wine, prosecco and sparkling wine, beer, water, sodas, et al. - all very reasonably priced. Our room was very comfortable (great beds, nice bedding) and extremely modish! We had a wonderful view over the canal. In the bathroom, we were well-stocked with Ritual bath products and really nice towels. Special touches abound at the Mauro. We were very appreciative that Berry could generate our front-of-the-line Van Gogh Museum tickets (as well as Rijks Museum tix) and add the charge to our hotel bill, and also was happy to print our boarding passes. Finally, we were extremely impressed that - after mentioning prior to arrival that one of our fellow travelers was gluten-intolerant - Berry & Marcel provided her with high-quality gluten-free breads during the duration of our stay! If I had one very tiny dislike, it was the folding metal chairs in our room - not very comfortable, especially for pregnant gals (2 of us are with-child).

The bathroom was very clean and i fell in love with the bath tub, in a two night stay i had 3 baths! The breakfast was great and the couple who run the hotel were so attentive bringing a different treat to your table each morning (fruit salad and small dutch pancakes). I must say though the best part about this hotel is the service! Marcel & Berry clearly love their hotel and have built it up from nothing. The little things really made our stay ie. 50% off vouchers for the museum we were visiting that day or the amazing coffee to go.

Having read previous fantastic reviews, we decided to check it out for ourselves. We have to wholly agree that every good word said about the Mauro Mansion is 100% true. The location is ideal for anyone getting dropped off near the Central Station as it was only a five minute walk to the hotel. We arrived a little early to the hotel but were greeted warmly by our hosts who allowed us to drop our bags off and recommended some good places nearby to head for lunch. We returned to the hotel a little while later and were shown our room, to which our luggage had been delivered for us. The room was magical. We were up on the top floor and to our delight we were in the room with the Barbers Chair which was a lovely addition to the beautiful room. The bed was magnificently comfy and we knew we would be having a good nights sleep on there. Complimentary chocolates, drinks and bathroom products added to a very impressive first opinion. The bathroom had a jacuzzi-type bathtub and a walk-in shower, all with the added benefit of under-floor heating. A \"Honesty Bar\" was a nice touch too, allowing you to pick up drinks and snacks at any time of the day or night and just declare them upon checking-out and were all at a very reasonable price. There is also a fine selection of DVDs to enjoy in your room at your leisure. Nothing was too much trouble for our hosts who even allowed us to leave our bags in their care so we could enjoy our last day of sightseeing without lumbering our bags around with us. The breakfast was exquisite, with fresh bread, ham, cheese, salami, and yoghurts available as well as a lovely addition of Strawberries and Yoghurt to start with. The hotel is within easy walking distance of the hustle and bustle of Amsterdam Centre but set back enough to ensure a good night's sleep will be enjoyed. All-in-all, a very impressive hotel which we would love to stay in again in the very near future.

They helped us to orientate ourselves on arrival and gave us some tips on places to go for food which were excellent but which we wouldn't have discovered ourselves. The overall relaxed atmosphere of the hotel was just right. The mini bar has snacks on arrival and you can then top up as required during your stay. Breakfast is self-serve and as the hotel describes is based on quality not quantity. I would concur. All of the items are of a very high standard, there is enough variety and we left each morning very satisfied. We had room 34 which was on the top floor because his nibs wanted a bath. This room has a large jacuzzi bath which was very nice. I loved the quirky features of the room, the beams and ladder although what the ceiling height metal cage is about we forgot to establish! Mauro is conveniently located just off the red light district, don't be put off by thinking it is too close, it's not. It's also handily close to the train station again without being too close. Being right in town means that if you are visiting for a few days you can walk everywhere. We loved that we could pop back to the hotel easily by foot for a relax pre-evening. Having worked in a number of hotels in my teens I do make for a picky hotel guest. Mauro was a delight to stay in for the reasons described above and the nice touches like the surprise breakfast item each morning: mini pancakes one day, omelettes, the next, and then fresh pineapple.
