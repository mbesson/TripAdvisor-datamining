However... This hotel was terrible overall, and I'm not one given to hyperbole. The room felt very cheap (complete with mold in the bathroom and water stains on the furniture), our \"view\" was a concrete wall, and there were no \"extras\" whatsoever: no clock, no iron, no adapter for our power outlets. There were only 9 channels on the TV, 1 in English, and it was fuzzy. The advertised \"free wi-fi\" only works in the lobby. The primary manager behind the front desk generally seemed annoyed to assist you (however his assistants were very helpful). To top it all off, when our room felt stuffy (because it was warm during our early October visit), we tried to turn on the air but were told it had been turned off for the winter. We opened our one window, but there was no screen on it so we got lots of Venice's infamous tiger-mosquito bites which made the rest of our trip very uncomfortable. (I counted 22 bites on me from one night of sleeping with the window open.) Also, we were above the smoking patio so had lots of smoke waft into our room, and loud talking to keep us awake. Looking back I can laugh now that it's over, because just when things seemed to be at their worst, something else happened to take the cake. At the time, we were not laughing. It was the low point of our trip to Europe, and in such a beautiful, wonderful city.

My experience was very pleasant. There is a group of rooms towards the back of the hotel which have windows onto the canal, mine was one of these. It was a 'bijou' room - a single so no necessity for much space, but also the furnishing and d\u00c3\u00a9cor is very 'love-it-or-loathe-it' Venetian. Full opportunities to feel a bit like a Disney Princess should you choose to. The bathroom was narrow which could have been a problem had I wanted to see it as one, however the shower was big enough to dance in (yes, I did test that out) which makes a nice change for hotels. That said I was apparently very lucky with my room. Others in the group who had opted to share found that they had been allocated rooms where they had to banish some of the furniture to the corridor in order to fit in two people and two suitcases. Some had rooms at the front of the hotel which is opposite (very closely opposite) a church, with bells, which ring for services, and to mark the hours. Not everyone's cup of tea! The rooms facing the canal can get a little noisy in the early morning when the delivery boats or rubbish collection boats start up - but we had to be up and out early so it wasn't a problem for me. The location was superb, a couple of minutes walk from a stop on the Grand Canal and only a few minutes walk from the Piazza di San Marco. The Reception staff were very helpful and had excellent English. What lets this hotel down a little is the breakfast arrangements. The room where guests eat is very cramped and the tables are very close together - everyone's conversation can be overheard by everyone else.

The room and the bathroom were very tiny (WOW a tiny room in Europe, get use to it, it's Europe. Have you seen their cars?). We had room 346, which had a view of the rooftops. But it was quiet and when you're tired of sightseeing, it's kind of nice to have a quiet place at night. The bed was a little on the hard side, but we slept ok. The breakfast they offer is good, for how breakfasts go in Europe (caffe',bread, juice, cold cuts, cheese and pastries). Our room and bathrooms were very clean with all the amenities needed for a few nights stay, including a safe. The location of this hotel in the Campo Giglio had easy access to Rialto, San Marco, etc... weather you were walking or using Vaporetto number one (and only #1). The Vaporetto is such a short walk (down a very narrow alley street) to the hotel, that when you're lugging luggage it's great not to have to walk a long way. They do have a tiny elevator with a couple of steps to it and the entrance is at ground level. If you decide to come in by water taxi they have an entrance of the side canal in the back. Now one of the assets of the hotel was Antonio. Antonio went out of his way many times to act not only as a front desk person, but also a concierge. For example, there was a transportation strike on Friday the 11th, the wife wanted to go to Murano, he suggested a co-promotion (no strings attached) with one of the glass foundries they were having at the time. With that he called a taxi and away we went free of charge. All in all, it was a great place to stay and if I ever go back to Venice I will stay here. Our stay was stress free and we really enjoyed it here. ps; remember Venice is a walking and walking and walking... city, so the easier you make it to get to your hotel, the less stressful it will be.

Good things: Breakfast fine for continental, tea lukewarm water though, coffee better as out of machine so hot. Room - small but adequate, bathroom equipped with usual toiletries. Not so good: Terrible smell hits you as walk in reception and was there throughout stay. Was of stale water?? Luckily was not noticeable in room. Pillows were rock hard but bed large and comfortable. Few words about Venice itself that I hope will be of help to travellers, it is extremely expensive!! If you wish to eat out in restuarants every evening be prepared to pay!! Eg: 3 euros for a coke, 1.50 euros to use public toilets, 80 for a 40 min gondola ride. Attractions expensive to visit too. We found it better to eat meal at lunchtime as slightly cheaper and just have slice pizza ect at night. Venice is a beautiful unique city but very much geared for tourists. All restuarants seem to sell pretty much same food, even on back streets and away from city centre. We tried local's food eateries thinking they may be a better experience but were just as expensive and food seemed to be similar to other restuarants, there is lots to see in Venice and it is easy to spend hours just walking round looking at the shops and people so take comfortable shoes and enjoy!!", "Date": "March 15, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "london", "Title": "\u201cExcellent location, lovely hotel\u201d", "Author": "LondonJennie", "ReviewID": "UR99382169", "Content": "I stayed here for a long weekend over Carnevale week.

I had looked at the hotel website and how it is portrayed is very deceiving indeed. The rooms are tiny, the bathrooms (well, we had a shower room) are miniscule. We were taken up to our room on arrival and were really disappointed, so disappointed in fact that my husband insisted on going back to reception to ask for a different room. I had booked this hotel with them directly and paid for it in advance, otherwise I am sure we would have gone somewhere else. To be fair, the guy on reception was very helpful and found us an alternative room - sadly, it wasn't much better although it did have a little balcony (although the outlook wasn't much so we didn't use it). When making the booking, I had made it clear that this was special trip celebrating a special birthday so we wanted one of their better rooms. Well, if the two that we saw were their better rooms, I shouldn't like to imagine what the rest are like!! On a positive note though, the location of the hotel is fantastic - a 2 minute walk from the water bus and only a 5-10 minute walk from St Mark's. Breakfast is a standard continental one but there was lots of choice and it was pleasant. We had a problem with our shower in our room which we reported to the reception and when eventually they tried to fix it, it remained temperamental. Again, on a positive note, for our patience in waiting for the shower to be fixed, we were given a complimentary bottle of wine which was a nice gesture. On the day of our departure, we had to check out by 11am but weren't leaving Venice until about 5pm so we left our luggage at the hotel until we were ready to leave. When we came to collect our luggage later that day, we were informed that we owed them an extra 23 euros. (To cut a long story short, we had booked this trip approx a month before and were unable to travel at the last minute so the hotel agreed to grant us a credit voucher if we rebooked, as we had paid in advance. When I had rebooked, I didn't book over the internet as I had previously, but I phoned the hotel reception and checked availability with them verbally before booking my flights. At that time, I asked if there would be anything extra to pay and I was told definitely no). So, I was a bit taken aback when I was asked to pay an extra 23 euros. Ok, it was only 23 euros, but nothing had been mentioned when we had checked out in the morning and when I explained to the receptionist that I wasn't happy about it but I would pay it, he got very defensive and quite sharp with me - not good customer service in my opinion. All in all, its a pretty shabby hotel and apart from one or two of the staff, their customer service skills leave alot to be desired. Venice is so beautiful though, I didn't let my disappointment of our accommodation spoil our trip. Its supposed to be a 3-star but I would say it's nearer a 1-star.

The hotel is positioned in a lovely square which looks out onto a church with venetian style engraving and is five minutes walk from San Marco square on the main route through the city. Perfect positioning in our eyes. We were greeted throughout our stay by very friendly receptionists who were always very helpful in answering the standard tourist questions.

Our room was a standard double room which looked out onto the church in the square. It was perhaps what some people would consider small but it was plenty big enough especially if you are using it as a place to go and see the sights. Venice hotels generally have smaller rooms so that should be expected. The rooms were clean, our double was the standard continental two beds pushed together but we didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t really notice and it was comfortable. The rooms were very well air conditioned coping well with humid 30 degrees C outside, having to be turned down a lot of the time. The rooms were very quiet with the walls seemingly not letting any sound through even with a family with a baby next door and we didn't hear any noise from outside (the square was very quiet at night.) The bathroom was clean and had complementary shampoo etc. and was cleaned everyday with new towels given when required but not replaced every day. Food in Vencie is quite expensive so a big good breakfast was great. It was standard continental offering with a very wide selection (croissants with or without jam filing, fruit, ham, fruit salad etc.) all good quality food and they were more than happy for you to take as much as you wanted. Lots of hot drinks made to order which were nice. On nice days they had a small covered outside area open where you can sit and have breakfast or in the afternoon sit and watch the world go by which was really nice. One of the days we wanted tea in the afternoon. There was a waiter on duty that was more than willing to help and we were not charged which was even better.

Venice was our final and favorite stop. After days of stale croissants and strong coffee at hotels throughout Italy, we were happily suprised by BEL SITO's buffet breakfast. My husband was flipping over the ham & eggs. The rooms were charming. We had a view of the canal. The staff went above and beyond even helping me recover my prescription eye glasses, that I had forgotten in the gondola. The night desk clerk is a little rude, but we were so full of wine and romance by then that we really didn't care. Just tell him \"ciao\" and head out the door. In five minutes, you'll be in San Marco square listening to the live quartets play classical music. BEL SITO was a located just far enough away from the herd like crowds that engulf San Marco, yet convenietly near everything. We joked that no matter where we asked to go, the staff would say 10 minutes. But it's really true. When we didn't get lost we made it to Rialto in 10 minutes.

Basic 3 star hotel, but clean and facilities adequate. Hotel is in 2 parts - main section (5,6 storeys?) over looking Campo and a fine Baroque Church; rear section across a courtyard with 4 first floor rooms nos A-D; (no lift to these, note). First 3 ovelook canal, lean out carefully for a view of a gondola stop & the Grand Canal. Avoid room D if you can - suspect a/c and dark outlook over courtyard, that one went to the 2 who didn't mind a hot room. Room C was fine. Both rooms had small but clean, daylit bathrooms with shower cubicles, which worked well and were preferable to baths with shower hoses which we came across elsewhere. We found front desk staff ok, during the whole holiday if you start off with trying to speak Italian it makes a big difference - a 'buon giourno' and a 'grazie' goes a long way (and you only need to try to say it, not spell it...). Some of the staff are more cheerful than others, some speak better English than others, that is to be expected. The porter/waiter/maintenance man was grouchy with me but I had fiddled with his a/c controller in room D, having missed being told not to. Breakfast was the most basic we came across but was what I would expect by the term 'Continental Breakfast', and was perfectly acceptable. The big plus is the location - 5 mins from St Marks, a 'vaporetto' stop at the end of the square. I disagree with the previous reviewer who suggested staying in the Lido was preferable. Here, you can see Venice waking up, get around the city easily, experience it at night. 3 stars for the hotel, one more for the location.", "Date": "August 17, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "2", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Banchory", "Title": "\u201cA flaming nightmare!\u201d", "Author": "HolidaymakerBanchory", "ReviewID": "UR8433764", "Content": "Our first night in Venice was in this hotel. On arrival we noted that the hotel was rather run down more so than Venetian character and room was rather basic. However as it was ideally located and we were only booked for two nights we decided to stay although I have to admit both of us were rather disappointed. At approximately 11-12pm that night I woke to a strong smell of smoke followed by banging at our door a few minutes later. This was our kindly downstairs resident alerting us to the fact that he had heard a popping noise in his bathroom and had discovered flames coming from his extractor fan which was not being used at the time. Concerned for our safety he alerted us and on opening our bathroom door thick smoke billowed out and molten plastic was falling from our extractor fan. The fire alarm was going off but was very quiet and throughout this whole episode the hotel was not fully evacuated. Thankfully we were near the main stairs which led to the only fire exit at the main door. To our alarm the door was locked when we got there! There was an italian porter in residence who spoke very little English and eventually opened this and phoned the fire brigade. We sat outside for over an hour and no information was imparted to us by hotel staff. Later after asking ourselves we were informed it had been an electrical fault and that we were safe to go back to our rooms. Yes, we were expected to go back to a smoke affected room as was our kindly neighbour downstairs. On pointing our that this would clearly not be safe our pleasant the staff offered us an alternative room at the other side of the hotel which was clearly the furthest from the only fire exit. After discussion we indicated that we would not feel comfortable sleeping there so at 2am checked out and walked round to book into an alternative hotel. I would certainly not advise anyone to stay at this hotel. Clearly there are issues with the electrics and little concept of fire safety or evacuation procedures. Whilst this is not a luxury hotel there can be no compromise on resident safety. Venice is wonderful I would hate for anyone else to have their first night in Venice tospoiled by the events related above.", "Date": "August 16, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "1", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Sydney", "Title": "\u201cAverage\u201d", "Author": "Corsette", "ReviewID": "UR8263272", "Content": "Great location & our room (A) had a fab view of the canal.

It was extremely easy to find the hotel and get to -- just a short walk from the Vaporetto stop. Upon arrival, the staff were very efficient, courteous and helpful. I was traveling with my brother and sister-in-law so we required a room with three beds. I expected we would get a double bed and a cot and was greatly surprised to find a twin bed instead of a cot in a canal-side room that was quite spacious. Beds were actually quite comfortable as well. The bathroom was small but functional, the air-conditioner really worked (for which we were very grateful as it was in the 90s when we were there), and the hotel had an elevator. Breakfast was included -- standard juice, coffee, rolls but enough to keep us going first thing in the morning. The location was great. Only about a 5 minute walk from San Marco Square and yet very quiet at night. Room rate was 150 Euro/night which I thought was quite reasonable in Venice in high season.
