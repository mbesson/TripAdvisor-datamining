{"Reviews": [{"Content": "Awful! On arrival to this hotel I was horrified from the start! There is a front door on a street between bars that was desperately in need of a coat of paint. We had planned Easter Weekend in Berlin with our children and this 3 star (should be 1 star) hotel seemed great. The family room itself was large and the beds were clean. But the room was also very smelly, noisey from the floor above and extremely basic. We left the children in the car and went up the thread bare carpeted stairs to the reception. I speak a little german so the language barrier was fine. The receptionist showed us our room which was up another flight of thread bare, ripped carpeted stairs (complete with the odd beer bottle), there weren't any lights working so I fell into the corridor much to the receptionists amusement! As I said the room was clean and large and if that's all you want then this querkey hotel could be for you! Breakfast was providied by the restaurant out side the hotel (this was lovely) the restaurant was a cosy and friendly place and it was a lovely buffet that suited the whole family. I really didn't feel safe in this hotel there were locks everywhere and it was dark and very worn down everywhere. We paid \u9227?00 per night for a family room and for the price I suppose we got what we paid for. It was within walking distance to the train station and there restaurants within walking distance too. I would never reccomend this hotel to families but maybe for couples who have every intention of spending as little time as possible in the hotel. There was a television and that was all. No drinks available in the hotel or food and the mini fridge was broken but heh Berlin is beautiful and despite the hotel being very Faulty Towers we had a superb time.", "Date": "Mar 25, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR571763779", "Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "2", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "1", "Value": "1", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "Shoppymad"}, {"Content": "Hotel tres bien situ\u8305 proche du...   showReview(11359839, 'full');", "Date": "May 18, 2006", "ReviewID": "UR119046744", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "4", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "lass="}, {"Content": "Bella pensione..ci siamo...   showReview(11359840, 'full');", "Date": "Aug 30, 2004", "ReviewID": "UR580944022", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "4", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "lass="}, {"Content": "Le titolari dell'albergo...   showReview(11359841, 'full');", "Date": "Jan 27, 2004", "ReviewID": "UR202350080", "Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "4", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "lass="}, {"Content": "Ottimo rapporto qualit\u813f/prezzo...   showReview(11359842, 'full');", "Date": "Jan 12, 2004", "ReviewID": "UR620759709", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "4", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "lass="}], "HotelInfo": {"HotelURL": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g187323-d529519-r14509609-Alte_City-Berlin.html", "HotelID": "529519", "Price": "$108"}}
