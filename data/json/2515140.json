The room was clean and comfortable and had a fridge and microwave and coffee maker. I was able, therefore to make my oatmeal in the morning and then go to the 360 at 11 when they opened. They have 3 computers in a room near the front desk to do email etc so all my needs were cared for.

The only exceptions to the rule were the manager and Cesar, Jeff and Rachel. I won't name the worst ones but I am sure they know themselves ... basically, if you weren't someone they can flirt with, they'd treat you like garbage! I never saw a hotel where they'd ask you to come pick up your own extra towels from the front desk, never smile at you and where the employees would have inappropriate conversations about undergarments and such right there in front of a guest! EXTREMELY unprofessional, if it were up to me I'd re-train those people. Oh, and people, \"Uh-huh\" is NOT the customer friendly response to \"Thank you\"! Only one person (Rachel) would respond with \"No problem\" ... there's also \"Sure\", \"Anytime\" and \"You're Welcome\", in case you were wondering what an appropriate response would be!

The room was a decent size, not cramped. The little kitchen was a wonderful plus, even includes free coffee. Bed was good and clean, linens and towels clean and fresh. They gave me a room facing the courtyard which was nice and quiet. However, around 6pm a loud rattling sound boomed into my room. Happened three times, lasting 5seconds each. Then happened again early morning. The front desk does not have any idea what it is. I inspected corridor , nothing, did not sound like coming from next room or upstairs, and cleaners would not be working around that time. I finally figured out my room was near the stairwell, and maybe a guest would go downstairs and rattle banisters or rails or something, but it was really weird.

The staff is completely incompetent and insulting. Here is my story. I booked a reservation for New Year\u2019s Eve with my girlfriend. I called the number on the website (on hotels.com) and told them I was looking for a room that overlooked the Space Needle so we could see the fireworks. The guy said he didn\u2019t have any rooms overlooking the space needle but he would give us a room where we could see the fireworks. I made it clear we were only interested in reserving a hotel room if we could view the fireworks from the room. As we will later see, this was not the case. We got to the hotel and found street parking. When we arrived at the counter the staff seemed very nice. I asked them if there was hotel parking, because I didn\u2019t want to have to move my car before the next day. They told me street parking was free on New Year\u2019s and they also had free hotel parking in another lot. Later I asked for one of these passes before I left to eat at a restaurant. The staff seemed good intentioned, but completely incompetent. My girlfriend is Japanese and one of the staff members told us there were a number of good restaurants in the area and then told my girlfriend there is bubble tea if she wants some. Neither of us said anything, because we both were surprised by the comment. He then continued to ask her if she likes bubble tea. It seemed like a weird and completely unprofessional thing to say, but I just thought \u201cwhatever.\u201d Next, we went up to the room. I looked out the window and it was a view of the other side of the building. There was absolutely no view whatsoever of fireworks or any park of the city for that matter. It was a completely blocked off view. I went back to the desk and told them we specifically asked for a room with a view of the fireworks. The lady said that there weren\u2019t any rooms with a view of the fireworks. I asked her why the hotel staff member on the phone said there was. She said I booked the reservation through hotels.com and they were the ones at fault, not the hotel. She said they have had problems with hotels.com in the past. She said there was nothing she could do and that I could try to cancel my reservation through hotel.com if I wanted to. I told her we had nowhere else to go and we were promised a view of the fireworks (it actually said we wanted a view of the Space Needle on the reservation printout she gave me). I said they need to take responsibility for hotels.com mistakes if they are going to contract with them. After attempting to reason with her for way too long she finally told me I they would tell hotels.com they would grant the cancellation and that I could still stay in the room. When we finally got to the point of speaking with hotels.com and giving her the phone to grant the permission she said to me \u201cso we are going to cancel your reservation and that means you are going to have to check out of the hotel.\u201d At this point I was extremely frustrated. I told her she just told me a second ago that she said I could stay in the hotel for free. Long story short, it got to the point where I finally reasoned with her. She called her manager and asked him if I could stay in the room for free and the manager granted that (side note: while she was on the phone with the manager the bubble tea guy was telling me in a very illogical, confusing way that the hotel was full and I might not be able to stay there unless the manager granted it. I told him we already had a room. Long story short, these two hotel staff were complete idiots). The next day\u2026 I went to checkout and there were two new hotel staff at the counter (these two were middle age, so I figured they might be a little smarter due to life experience). The lady took my room keys and parking pass. She said she was going to charge me $15 for parking. I told her the hotel staff told me it was free and that I didn\u2019t even use the pass because I was lucky enough to find street parking again. She said \u201cI see on the computer what happened last night. Parking is $15 and I\u2019m charging it to your card.\u201d I told her again that the hotel staff told me it was free. In a very aggressive tone she said \u201cYou\u2019re a con artist.\u201d I was shocked. She told me she didn\u2019t want to listen to my side of the story. This business does not deserve to stay in business. If you believe this situation is unacceptable, then please do not support this business. If you simply just need a place to stay and don\u2019t deal with the hotel staff, then this place is just fine. The rooms are clean and comfortable.

I told her I didn't save them (why would I keep my old paper parking passes?).. then she became enraged telling me that she was now going to have to charge me 250 bucks apiece for these paper passes (!!)remember, these are for paper parking passes no one ever instructed me to hold onto. Apparently, one pass is good for your entire stay but the staff clearly didn't know this and didn't communicate this to me. Regardless, she continued to threaten me as if I was \"holding out\" on her. I told her there would be no reason or benefit for me to keep the passes from her if I had them but did not have a time machine to retrieve them at this point. She stormed off on me after I told her I was in shock about her level of unprofessionalism and rudeness. The funny thing is that the old passes ended up being on the floor of my rental car and I gave them to another employee - but the point of the matter is that this horrifying and embarassing incident completely ruined my experience in this godawful place. It was bad until then but that incident was just the topper. I kept reminding myself that that kind of white trash is just what you can expect from such a sketchy spot. it didn't make me feel better. do yourself a favor and stay at the new Silver Cloud like my friends did.

WOW!! FINALLY an inexpensive hotel in downtown Seattle without emptying out our wallets! AND, you don't need a car - everything was in walking distance!! The front desk people (awesome service) had us heading to every eclectic, fabulous cafe, restaurant and shop in the area (all within a block or two), and we even did the touristy thing and walked up and down the boardwalk on the bay checking everything out. Macys, Nordstroms and all of the great downtown shopping is in walking distance too - and theatres, etc. The studios are a bit smaller than, say, the Hilton or Sheraton, but on the upside they were very cozy and clean. Loved having the kitchenette. You have to pay for Internet in your room (small fee), but we used the Internet in the free business center .

If you get a room facing the street be prepared to hear crackheads (and I say this, because you can literally watch them hitting their pipes in the alley accross the street) ALL NIGHT LONG. All that being said, you are downtown in a big city, and whether you are here, or somewhere higher end like the Fairmont/Hyatt, there are those types of people outside (more here, but you WILL see them anywhere), and they pretty much are not there to harrass you....they just do their little cracky thing in peace. We got this while we are moving our place isnt ready for 2 weeks....so this is a good value for in town (if you are willing to not be in town , there are many extended stay properties in Kent and beyond that offer more amenties for a lower price) In fact I think it is the best value in town. The building is secure. The staff is very nice. The room is TINY.....think Motel 6 in size (for long term living this is not) with a little kitchenette, and flat panel tv. Internet is NOT free (why?) except in the business center, and there is no specified parking, you have to park down the street in a $15 a night lot, or hope to find parking on the street (but move your car beetween 8am-6pm daily).....The room is very clean.....no a/c but rarely would you need it....there is heat (in winter youll need it) really I don;t have any complaints about the property itself besides the parking and pay internet, the location/noise thing isnt there fault, and for the price Im happy to just be somewhere safe and clean.", "Date": "July 24, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "3", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Sweden", "Title": "\u201cPerfect for the right traveller\u201d", "Author": "cross-check", "ReviewID": "UR17650126", "Content": "Centrally located this place is perfect if you're not carborn and/or want to live downtown Seattle with close proximity to the waterfront.

Big and nice desk and LCD TV that's not in the way. Staff is friendly and efficient, front desk open 24 hours which feels safe. Could be better: affordable parking options, internet these days should be complimentary and wireless (they have a business centre but that's SO not attractive), mirror (one in bathroom only), noise reduction from the street (thin windows), cooling options (no airconditioning, hot in summer!)
