From the T2 Barcelona terminal you can travel easy and cheap to Placa Espagna and take a Metro from there to Bogatell ( 3 stops) - from this station, the Hotel is 2 streets away, a 5 min walk. Also, the Barcelona City Tour Bus has a stop very close to the hotel so, if you intend to buy tickets for city sightseeing, better choose this company). Our room, although a simple double one, was very friendly, clean, the matresses were comfortable, the bathroom clean and nice. We didn't try the hotel SPA or the outside pool area ( it looks very good on the top of the hotel but in March you can't use it).

The hotel itself is very nice, with a good bar area and excellent breakfast. The hotel staff are extremely friendly and willing to help with restaurant bookings, directions etc. we were offered a glass of cava on arrival which was also a nice touch. The rooms are thoroughly cleaned daily (I came back one day to find the maid in the bath really scrubbing it clean) the only disappointment is that the aircon did not work and the rooms were extremely hot at night, we did hear several people complaining at reception and were told it wasn't turned on until mid April, which is poor when a hotel is advertised as having aircon. The rooftop pool is nice, but shaded in the afternoons and the water is very cold, the hotel has a gym, but it is very small with 3 machines and some weights, you could not fit more than 3 people in there at one time. There is also an option of using the Spa for 16 Euros per session, but I did not use this so cannot comment. The hotel is a 10 - 15min walk from the Marina\u2019s bars and restaurants and approx 5 min walk to Bogatell metro station or 20 minute walk to Marina metro station. At the stations be sure to buy a T10 ticket for 9.25 Euros which gets you 10 separate trips and can be used between a group of people.

Mini bar (prices are a bit much as can be expected from a mini bar!) Bathroom comes equiped with hair dryer, boxed tissues, toothbrush, shower cap, moisturiser, shower gel, shampoo, razor, shoe shiner (random, I know!), comb and two soaps (and a soap dish!!) Safe is free - a real bonus as I don't know anybody who doesn't put their passports and things in them during their stay!! Beds are massive, two singles pushed together I think - but most places do that now - and it didn't cause a problem at all. I emailed the week prior to my stay to request a higher level end room as these tend to be a bit bigger and quiter - the only downside was the air con didn't work, however the heating did! Also, there was no balcony - bare this in mind if you're someone who likes to share a bottle of wine on the balcony and watch the world go by! The rooftop pool would be lovely in summer - too cold in March despite temperatures of 20/21 degrees! The pool was FREEZING (I had to dip my toes in!) but if you're there for a weekend break I doubt you'll hvae time for the pool anyway! The bar was nice, bar man was lovely, Cava was quite cheap to buy -12 euros a botttle )but 14 in the rest =/ ) and about 3.50 a glass, larger was quite expensive though around 5 euros for local larger!! Food in the rest was beautiful!!! And staff wonderful - very attentive!!! Beautiful water feature downstairs in the wine cellar/dining hall with a grand piano - nice touch!! Can't comment on the Spa facillities as I didn't use them! The only bad thing about this hotel was air con not working and our room wasn't cleaned! We left the room at 8am hanging the 'please clean the room' sign and returned at 6pm after about 10 mins house keeping staff knocked on the door and asked if we wanted anything! It's not that big of a hotel, working in one myself for many years, and travelling a lot - I know it should have been done by this time! HOWEVER, I was only there two nights so I am unsure whether or not this was just a one off! LOCATION: The location is IDEAL, as long as you don't mind a short walk! It is not in the centre of the main square of Catalunya but is central to all the attractions collectivelly! 10 mins from the beach, 10 mins from the zoo (well worth a visit - 17 euros), 10 mins from the (beautiful) park, about 15/20 mins to the Arc, 20/30 mins to La Rambles and Playa Catalunya, The cathedral is about 30 mins but if you're up for the walk it is litterally straight up one road - you will see on the map given to you at reception! if you really don't like the walk - there is a 'Barcelona sightseeing' bus (the red open top ones you see in every city!) that stops every 15 mins 2 mins from the hotel, (24 euros for one day, 31 for two) there is a big list at the bus stop of the attractions that you can see, we didn't use this and felt like we seen loads but may use it next time to make sure we see everything!! There are also two metro stations a short walk away! Bogatell is about 3 mins away and the Marina station about 7/8! These have connections to everywhere! You can get a single anywhere in Barcelona for 2 euros!! Which brings me to my next point: Getting around: Taxi's, well, from the airport there is no saying how much it will cost you, from other reviews I was expecting around 28/29 euros - but no, we were quoted around 35-40! The meter when as we were arriving said 25 and magically the next is said 37!! The driver then pretended not to speak ANY English (even pointed at the meter 'trying' to say the numbers) even though he had NO difficulty understanding and answering us when we asked how much it would be - I'm assuming it was because we were young! The only reason we got a taxi was because it was 8pm! There is a train from terminal 2 at the airport that can get you to Bogatell station for TWO euros! 37 euros to get there 4 for us both to get back! There are two changes mind! One at Sants, then the L1 line to Catalunya (the first stop!) and then Catalunya to either Marina or Bogatell. OR From sants to the Arc (about a 10 min walk form the hotel) if you're like me and this all sounds a bit too much for when you first arive, save all that until the journey home when you are familiar with the surroundings - it's easier than it sounds - you get a train map! But I would seriously get the train to Sants and get a taxi from there - SO much cheaper!! Sants and Catalunya both have excelent English speaking staff that are really helpful! Taxi's and the metro can get you anywhere but I'd recommend the walk - was lovely (and hopefully burned off a few calories from all that wonderful food!!)

There is a rooftop pool with lovely views of the city but unheated so didn't dip my toes in with it being the end of February. The breakfast is amazing with food on nearly 3 sides of the room so absolutely loads of choice for everyone. For us it was included in the room rate and I don't honestly know if we would have paid \u20ac15 each for it as there are plenty of places outside that you could choose to eat and watch the world go by. The room was fine; quite small but with windows that open so that was a nice change. We wandered down to Barceloneta each night to eat which was lovely and a lot less touristy than the Marina/La Rambla areas. Then after dinner we went and had drinks in one of the many bars open late at the Marina so there really is something for everyone. Therefore we didn't eat in the hotel restaurant but had a couple of drinks at the bar and the barman is great. Friendly, good at his job and makes you feel welcome.

When you start to dig deeper though its a bit of a con, for one we had to fly from a London Airport and we live in Bristol so that made things more expensive, then when I looked into it we could have flown from Bristol for marginally more than the cost from Gatwick (where we decided to fly from) and the company that offered the deal were very crafy in only offering you late flights on the day of departure and early flights on the day of return. They were 'kind enough' to offer you other potential flights to allow you to spend more time in Barcelona but this was at an additional surcharge of \u00a340 or more - very crafty! The next thing was the price of the hotel, on the documentation from the holiday provider (clear skies holidays I believe) they found us the rooms through getabed.co.uk which quoted the room prices at rates which seemed pretty high to me - upon going to the H10 marina website myself and typing in the dates we were staying the room rate was <b>considerably</b> cheaper than the rate that had supposedly been paid through getabed. Also the groupon deal did not include breakfast at the hotel this was an extra 15E per day. This was not a major issue as we quite like to sleep in and eat breakfast at our leisure but something to bear in mind if you like to have breakfast included. The hard rock cafe meal was decent, although only includes a soft drink and you can only pick from a set menu of about 5 main courses and an ice cream pudding. We spent 40E on alcoholic drinks in there alone so they definitely made their money back off us. On doing my sums, I worked it out that I could have booked the same holiday to fly from Bristol for at least 100Euros cheaper and still had the meal in hard rock cafe choosing from the full menu rather than the gold one they give you to pick from. So to cut a long story short, before you book a holiday on groupon, look into the flight costs and booking up the hotel yourself as you will more than likely find that you can book everything much cheaper than quoted on groupon. But anyway... I will now give a quick review of the hotel since thats what I'm supposed to be reviewing! ** Read here for Hotel Review ** This hotel is in a brilliant location, in fact one of the best locations you could choose in my opinion. Its about a 10 minute walk from the beach which is really pleasant and well maintained. Maybe it would not be as nice in summer with loads of people on it but in February we saw about 15 people as far as the eye could see and being English a temperature of above 12C is practically beach weather anyway! Dont get me wrong it was cold but when we left England it was -3C so the extra 15 degrees makes a huge difference. If you were in direct sunlight you could be quite warm in just jeans, a tshirt and a sweater. Local amenities wise the hotel was fairly close to 2 supermarkets which were OK but the best place to get food and booze is Mercandona. Some of the staff in the hotel can tell you where it is (although one receptionist had never even heard of Mercandona) Its just a little bit further from the two closest supermarkets by the Marina metro station but they do much nicer food and have a better selection of cheap alcohol which despite the price is really pleasant to drink - I brought back 7 bottles of really good cava for \u00a310! For getting around in Barcelona I would recommend the Metro, there are 2 stations close to the hotel, Bogatell (the closest) which goes along the yellow line to most of the places in the centre and then there is the Marina station which is a little bit further but has more lines going much further around the city. A single journey to anywhere costs 2E, and for the time it takes its well worth that. Taxis in Barcelona are everywhere, easily recognisable by the yellow and black colour scheme and they all run on meters but if you want to save yourself a lot of money use the metro when you can its loads cheaper. Our taxi from the airport to the hotel cost 29E. One of the friendly staff at the hotel adivsed us that for the journey back to the airport we should get the metro from Marina to Castella Pl (I think thats the name of it) and get the easily recognisable blue and white Aerobus which only costs 5.50E. We did exactly this and it worked out at just about half the price of the taxi (2E for metro + 5.50E for bus) x 2 = 15E. The bus journey took about 25 minutes. One thing I should mention is that the Aerobus goes to both terminals at the airport and without checking we got dropped off at terminal 1 when we needed to be at terminal 2. There is a free shuttle bus which runs regularly which got us to terminal 2 just in the nick of time. Keep this in mind if you are thinking of getting the Aerobus! One last thing, if you fly with Easyjet from terminal 2, they are right at the end of the airport in gate C, you literally have to walk ages to get there and the signs in the airport do not make it at all obvious where you have to go. Hope someone finds this useful as we nearly missed our flight trying to find gate C. Its almost like the airport has based Easyjet right out in the sticks, make sure you give yourself a good 30 minutes extra to find the gate and check in desk - you'll need it! As I mentioned earlier the hotel charges separately for breakfast (which may not appeal to some) but personally I think 15E a day is really steep anyway and we were quite happy to venture out and find something to eat ourselves for cheaper. As we never tried any of the food at the hotel I cant comment on what its like, but the restaurant did seem quite posh looking so you would expect the food to not be cheap and horrible. The staff in the hotel were a mixed bunch, most of them were very helpful and friendly but one or two others did a very good job of making you feel like you were interrupting them from something really important. On the whole though the team on reception were helpful and spoke english well enough to save you from trying to communicate in broken spanish. The rooms are quite smart and clean (or at least ours was), the air con did take a while to warm up the room but at least it did work. The room had a safe which was free, and a big flatscreen TV which offered mostly spanish and catalan TV stations. Word of warning there is no 'on' button on the TV, after looking for about 20 minutes I finally figured out that the on button is actually a switch on the wall by the bathroom! The bathroom was clean and practical, nice marble type floors with a bath/shower combo, toilet, bday and free toiletries including a shower cap, razor, toothbrush and paste and the usual shower gel, shampoo and soap. Only thing that did hack me off about the room was that there is no tea or coffee making facilities, being English I like the chance to make tea at all times and I had been saving a pot noodle since I got off the plane and lo and behold there was no kettle in the room! On the plus side it did have a mini bar fridge which was good for storing the cava we bought at the local supermarket so that we had a nice cold alcoholic drink to start our evenings with! No idea what any of the stuff in the mini bar cost but unless you like to waste money just buy any drinks and snacks in the local supermarkets - it has to be loads cheaper! The beds in the room are very hard - not a problem for me as I prefer that to some super soft squidgy matress but might not be for everyone. Our double bed was actually two singles pushed together which most hotels seem to do these days - it was ok but beware of rolling onto the ridge between both beds which is not very comfortable to spend the night on. All in all though I slept really well every night - the pillows provided are really comfortable goose feather or something like that and for me the pillow is generally more important than the matress but thats my preference. Finally I should mention the swimming pools, there is a roof pool which as far as I could tell is free but is NOT heated. The view from the roof is really impressive and definitely worth a look, I would expect that in the summer the roof pool would be amazing, but in February the pool was absolutely freezing and there was no way any sane person would want to swim in it! The downstairs leisure/relaxation centre was another story, we knew we had to pay separately for it and initially I thought 15E was really expensive just to go swimming, but it was actually really nice down there. The combination of small swimming pool, warm tub and warm shower pool was really nice (note I call them warm - they were far from hot!). The steam room and sauna were very toasty though and the whole facility was warm with padded sun loungers around the main room. Both me and my partner lay down on one of the loungers for just a few minutes and both of us fell asleep... definitely relaxing down there! So in summary although the price tag seems a bit steep I'd recommend going to the leisure facility in the hotel at least one day. Its well worth it if you spend at least a couple of hours down there. Overall really liked this hotel and would definitely stay there again, only thing I would do different is to book it myself and not bother with any groupon holidays, its definitely cheaper to do it yourself!", "Date": "February 12, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Moscow, Russia", "Title": "\u201cBeautiful hotel with panoramic windows\u201d", "Author": "vkovr", "ReviewID": "UR124283687", "Content": "We got beautiful room with panoramic windows.

The location is quite excellent in a rather decent residential area. It is away from the bustling center of the city and close to the marina and playas. There are buses close-by and a subway station 3 blocks away. Restaurants and convenience stores are also near-by. The room is large, well-decorated and clean enough. The usual amenities are present, but the wi-fi signal is weak in the room. The a/c system was off because of the season (!). So we had to leave the window slightly open to get fresh air. Which in turn let the outside sound in. We soon discovered that the lot next to the hotel was a slum occupied by two migrants who sleep there under makeshift shelters made of cardboard and plastic (see picture). While one can see migrants in every country and Barcelona has probably less of a problem than Paris in that aspect. It seems strange that a nice hotel would tolerate this arrangement as we even saw rats crawling around under the rain. The abandonned lot is walled around, so it is impossible to see what's inside from the boardwalk. It is very saddening to see humans living that way in a not so poor country. One night, one of these guys got really mad, for some reasons, and he kept shouting on top of his lungs allnight. He would stop for 5 minutes then start again, There was no sleep that night. We complained next morning. The next night was quiet. I suggest a room away as possible of the street. Spanish, especially young males, have a tendency to be loud on their way back from their drinking points. But there are also good points to this hotel and I must think that the situation I had described is destined to be temporary. Sure, hope so. I would still recommand this hotel because of his location and his convenience. They have a breakfast buffet which is worthwhile. It is clean enough, although we had to ask twice to clean the room and change the towels. Every problem was resolved by a rather polite personal.

In order to have internet u need to get a name and password at the reception.

I would thoroughly recommend and the prices at this restaurant are decent. Restaurants are rather expensive if im honest and so are drinks! Surrounding the area there are a few supermarkets which are quite cheap for coke, water and holiday bits and bobs eg, snacks. The beach which is literally right next to the Marina ia a lovely beach. Sunbeds to hire. The only downside are the people that go up and down asking you if you want a massage or buy a drink or fresh coconut! Beach is clean and tidy though with a life guard present! The Tour bus also stops at the marina. I would recommend this to see the sites. we were only there for 3 days and found this sufficient to see Barcelona!! All in all the city is OK.

Variety of local and national menu options, all deicious, we ate at the restaurant in the hotel 3 nights and every morning - cannot fault the service or quality at all. Pool on roof was cold at this time of year, but was nice to sit up there in the sun by the bar and read and enjoy the views! Close to metro station, and from there it is 1 change on the underground train to catalunya, the busy centre station. Reception can tell you about the best ways to see the sights and get around the city. There is a spa area, but we didn't get time to use it. If we return, we will next time!

Breakfast was a huge buffet, our only gripe here was the coffee machines which you had to queue for and were of dubious taste! All in all we had a lovely stay.

It is a very modern hotel, free wifi, flat screen tv's etc, and the main attraction has to be the roof top pool, which in 34 degree temperatures is perfect to cool down in. The rooms are very spacious and have everything you need, hairdryer, fridge, tv, and the beds whilst firm were comfy and we both slept very well. Only small problem we had was in room 128 with the air conditioning not being cold enough. Initially we thought it might have been us doing it wrong but after a very very hot night with my boyfriend hardly getting any sleep, we asked reception to take a look at it whilst we were out the next day. We got back to the room and still not cool, so rang reception and sure enough they sent maintenance to fix it. A guy came and told us yes it was fixed, but after 10 mins still no cold air coming out so we rang reception again and asked to be moved rooms which was no problem. Room 103 was fine, and lovely and cool and no more problems with the air con. Breakfast was really good, a lovely variety of hot and cold food to choose from. Eggs, bacon, beans, melon, pineapple, pastries, cereals, and a selection of teas, fruit juices and coffee. YUM! We didnt eat at the restaurant for any other meals so cannot comment. The bars both in reception and upstairs by the pool were quite reasonably priced and the staff were very attentive. We found a cheap cafe around the corner on carrer de marina on the way to the marina where we had a couple of meals for lunch, pizza and spagetti bolognaise both very good, and between 5 and 7 euros each, very good value for money. If you are looking for a beautiful meal in authentic settings please go to a retaurant overlooking the beach called Escriba (google it and you would see it has been voted in the top 10 restuarants in Barcelona). You have to pre book as it gets very busy but the food was amazing. It wasn't cheap at over 100 euros (but that included 3 courses and a bottle of wine) but if you like seafood it is a must, the prawns were gorgeous, my mouth is literally watering at the thought of it. On our last day because our flight wasn't until 9pm we opted to pay to use the indoor spa. It cost 16 euros but meant we could use the indoor pool, steam room, sauna, jacuzzi, and hot and cold plunge pools. Very nice and good value for money considering it costs 5 euros if you want to get a shower after you have checked out. In summary we liked this hotel because it was modern, clean, has the roof top pool and was in a good location about a 10 minute walk to the beach and marina. It is near Bogatell Metro stop which is handy to get to las Rambles and La Sagrada Familia and near the bus stop for the hop on hop off tours as well. Go here and you will not be disappointed.

Both hotels were nice and clean. As mentioned by others, the beds are very firm, but I like firm beds so I slept nicely. The room at the Marina was a little larger than the Itaca but we didn't spend much time in the room so it wasn't a big deal. The showers in both hotels are weird. The \"door\" to the shower is a glass partition that goes down 1/2 the length of the bathtub. The partition in the Marina bathroom was missing a rubber piece underneath and water went everywhere on the bathroom floor. The tub was also narrow and slippery so all this combined frightened me since I am pregnant and was afraid of slipping. Also, we did hear the neighbors above us in the middle of the night and did not appreciate being woken up. The hotel employees in both hotels were accommodating and the breakfast was wonderful. It was also nice to have access to computers in the business centers. One tip to American travelers... when you get into your room, you have to place one of your room-cards in the little holder by the door to activate lights and air conditioning.

The breakfast buffet was good, consisting of fruits, eggs, cheese selections, cereals, yoghurt, and other continental standards. There was a roof deck pool, but since the area was a little small, some sun bathers got splashed by water when the kids started jumping into the water. Also, there was no water heater for the pool.

(When i say ocean view, i mean of course a glimpse of water and maybe a boat far away between some buildings). There is not much insulation, so you will probably be hearing noices from the hallway. At least in daytime. The bathroom had a combined tub and shower, which i hate. But the room itself was roomy and the shower good, although it felt a little cramped in the tub because of a glass door to prevent spilling on the floor. It also included the most amenities i've ever seen in a hotel bathroom. Including a shaving kit and a toothbrush. There is a TV in the room, but as much fun it is to watch simpsons and futurama in spanish, it get's boring after a while. Luckily there was a few british channels as well.

But there is two things that's not so good here. When i arrived the room was a little hot, so i put on the AC and went out. When i got back there was a massive rain shower and i was wet and cold, this combined with the AC being on full blast made it even colder, i tried to change it to heating, but it stayed on cold until i checked out the following day. With it being so cold you would think it would be nice to crawl under the bed sheets and get warm there. Well, the sheets were very thin so they didn't provide any heat at all. I'm sure thats very nice when its 30c outside, but not when the room is freezing. I have a cold now because of this.

There is a mini bar in the room with the smallest bottle of water in the world(think mini liquor bottle) The staff was helpful and accommodating. There is a nice rooftop pool and bar( we never got to enjoy the pool). This hotel is not in the heart of the city its in the middle of a neighborhood and seems more of a business hotel, which worked out great for us because it wasn't packed with tourist.

We were 'conned' for a 9Eu taxi which took us on a tour of the area before arriving at the Hotel. On arrival a very pleasant young lady welcomed us, took details and offered us a glass of reasonable quality Champagne as a welcome drink. Check in was - like the drink - very easy on the tired traveller! Problem was, after a short walk we found all local eateries closed (except for a take-away Pizza House) so returned to the Hotel for Dinner. Food and wine reasonable priced, but both main courses - which were superbly prepared - arrived COLD. We ate out after that! The room had a huge bed in which you could believe there was only you in it and the room seemed hard to warm up - until we realised the maid had left two windows slightly open. After that the heating was fine as the outside temperature dropped to single figures during the night. Bathroom was good - but a tiny bath so no lie down, but shower and toilet extras were as good as anywhere we have had - not being able in hand luggage to take a razor, a new one was provided daily as part of the service - without having to ask. Breakfast is proudly advertised in the hotel and it is excellent. Great for the Fresh Fruit fans and three kinds of cooked eggs and bacon for the full breakfast folks. Even the standard Cofee.Tea/Choccy machines were working perfectly. A 7 minute walk to the Harbour and the starting point of the Tour Buses was advised by the Reception and they sold us a pack for the coaches which discounted the tickets below the price we paid - good choice as we took a 2 day pass which allowed us to go all round the city on 2 sets of buses and get on/get off where we wished. I can see no other way we could have seen and done as much as we did and the pack was full of discount tickets for the more popular sites. Using the Bogatel Station we went back to Catalunya and Ramblas with ease - for walking and eating and - getting off at Barceloneta - we found a superb eatery (Club Tapas) near the station. Chef cooked all to order and it was impossible to find anything with which to complain - somuchso it prompted an extra tip for 'Chef' which he shared with his colleagues anyway! Hotel Marina was our base, our guide and our support and we will use it again next time we are in town. Nephew and Sister-In-Law are both now booked for there in December and March, but one word of advice to those who find walking a problem! The whole area around the hotel is flat - no problem there - but it is a walk to the nearest good restaurants and back - fine for a balmy summer evening, but nippy at this time of year and perhaps a location nearer the port or Ramblas would be better - one thing is certain - it will have to be special to beat this H10 venue.", "Date": "November 28, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Sleep Quality": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "Toronto, Canada", "Title": "\u201cBED BUGS!!!

We felt that being in our thirties we would choose a recommended hotel that could accustom our needs for a non typical Hen weekend. We were very much looking forward to it and made sure there was everything to make it a fantstic weekend...Champers on Ice and we booked in at all the fantastic restaurants. However, on our arrival the rooms were not ready after the stated booking in time so we were all forced to get changed in the toilets having to head to the beach and amuse ourselves until we could all freshen up. Of course this happens at times and after we made this point we were more than satisfied with a complimentary glass of champagne. Later that evening we were told to quiet down in the bar at 9 p.m - I felt that we were at a normal volume plus were not the only patrons spending lots of money at the bar. Due to the atrium lay out the noise carries on, due to acoustics (but I did note that the very next night a group of 11 men were not told to quiet down when being very raucous in the very same bar). After our night out at a restaurant I arrived home at 1.20 a.m to find that my room was playing music and had been doing so since 1 a.m. I immediately continued my role as 'Mum' and sent all to bed and the music off. We had not been provided with water in the mini bar and I felt that due to my Irritable Bowel Syndrome and Diabetes conditions plus needing to rehydrate my friends I went down to reception to ask to buy some water. I was refused quite rudely and was informed there had been a few complaints about the music being on for 20 minutes. I apologised for this and said it would not happen again the Hen fun had got slightly loud but that we all needed water. After still being refused I advised that not rehydrating could be detrimental to not only my health but my friends. I was given two glasses of water and was told that the two glasses was all I was getting. I took the gentlemans name on reception; Carlos - as I thought this outrageous treatment after mixing the hot climate and alcohol consumption. The next morning our 'Hen' was extremely rudely advised that any more music or noise and we would be kicked out Immediately. Going down to breakfasts we were made to feel absolutely uncomfortable and that we had all done something really, really wrong. We had dirty looks from the staff and were spat answers rather than treated with respect as all people should regardless of muisc being played, which we continually apologised for. It wasn't just at Breakfast we were made to feel like this it was every time we were in the hotel and this one 20 minute incident ruined the whole trip for us due to the extreme reactions from staff. When checking out on the morning of 23rd May I asked the female receptionist if they had a complaints Ombudsman I could contact - after a purposefully quiet night spent treading on egg shells and our concern at being threatened to be kicked out if we even breathed loudly, we still received atrocious treatment from staff at Breakfast and I felt compelled to try and air these views but in a letter rather than with the staff. Who I felt showed their distaste at our 20 mins of noise far too much. I would expect a professional reaction to our apologies and then for it to be dropped so we could enjoy our trip. I was very rudely laughed at by the female receptionist and after asking her name she took off her badge and spat that she would never give me her name and how could we complain after making noise for 20 mins on the first night. I pointed out that this treatment could not continue after our apologies and putting it into perspective we had some fun for TWENTY MINUTES...apologised for it then spent the rest of our trip being punished for it, Which is disgusting and uncalled for. Her colleague; Juiz Ramonez laughed and sarcastically said \"what you gonna do? Complain about the noise you made that first night?\" and they both laughed at me. In all my life spent holidaying for business and leisure (Barcelona included) I have never experienced such a negative, rude and sub standard service. We did not get to have all our planned treatments or champagne and lovely dinners in the hotel so we did that at The Port where we were welcomed with open arms, had fantastic food and met some beautiful local people and their families. Our 'Hen' and all of us were of course disappointed but we put it down to the staff letting their personal distaste cloud their professional judgement. Owning her own beach bar here at home our 'Hen' knows that great Customer Service is paramount to her bar/Restaurants contiuned success and reputation.

I was glad we were in a quiet place as I could not have stood staying near Las Ramblas with all the constant noise and traffic. The hotel was great, staff friendly, breakfasts were out of this world, with a choice of 120 dishes, they even had champagne! Swimming pool on the roof was a bit small (and freezing!) and with great views, but we still ventured in. There is an indoor pool with sauna, jacuzzi etc but that cost 14 euros each time to use it which was a rip off, so we didn't bother. You can buy 10 tickets on the metro for about 8 euros which is great value.

Whilst we were not offered a glass of bubbly the check in was quick and efficient. I had emailed the hotel in advance of our stay and requested a room on a high floor with a big window. Looking at the photos of some of the rooms on trip advisor, they looked quite small. Our room was really quite big with several large windows. The bathroom was clean and modern and the aircon worked well. The only real complain I have is the bed was really uncomfortable. The mattress was very hard. Some travellers have said that this hotel is in the middle of nowhere. I think this is a little unfair. The nearest metro is Bogatell which is a 4 minute walk. Alternatively you can walk less than 10 mins to Marina Metro which is very convenient for most places you are going to want to go. The real attraction of the location of this hotel for me was the fact that is was only 10 - 15 mins walk to Port Olympic and the beach! We had some great meals at the marina and we also strollled to Barcelonetta one morning. This is a long stroll but a fabulous route along the sea front all the way. We never had breakfast at the hotel so I can't comment on the quality of the food. The bar man made a grreat mojito even if it was a little pricey. We went to the roof top pool on a couple of occasions. There is a bar there too. It did tend to be frequented by hen/stag parties most of the day and there are only a handful of sun loungers so don't get too excited about this facility.

We did turn down the hotel breakfast (at an additional 10 euros/night) and opted instead to go to a cafeteria/cafe 2 blocks away (on the way to the Bogatell metro station) for a lighter breakfast. The walk to the beach was pleasant, and the walk to the Bogatell metro stop (yellow line) was convenient. It took a bit longer to get to the Marina stop (red line), but that wasn't much of a problem either.

I like the location of the hotel since it is quiet and connects me everywhere via metro. Hotel has a modern style. Our standard double room was clean. However, I wasn't so happy with my bed. It was slightly moving on the ground, when I was turning during night. Nevertheless, it is not a big complain. They have free wireless internet but in our room there was no signal so I had to go to lobby or connected from the stairs. There is a swimming pool on the roof of the hotel. It is extremely small, that's why it is not for swimming. However, if you stop by the hotel during day time after a long time walking, it could be extremely relieving. I have been there for sun bath and refreshing myself during day time and I enjoyed a lot. So, the size of the pool was not a big concern for me.

So I can say the area where the hotel is is safe, but the area at the nearest metro stop is shady at night. My spouse and I had the feeling that this hotel/ marina location was more residential compared to the La Ramba tourist area. We almost felt like we were in a ghost town. There was hardly anyone in the area during siesta and night. It could be because of winter months. It also was about a 15-20 minute walk to the marina area. Opinon on past member posts: I will also say this in regards to past posts. It was unfortunate for who ever had a damaged, uncleaned room. I would assume this was an oversight by housekeeping to report damages or cleaning. I found our room to be very clean, and the lobby was clean. So I can not say this hotel was dirty. For those complaining about pool fee...I am not surprised as most pools in Europe charge, even on military bases to their military members. My last piece of information is, book on a discount website because I paid about $100 for one night verse the average going rate of $200+", "Date": "February 7, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "2", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "3", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "Lugano", "Title": "\u201cTerrible nightmare! And don't expect anything from customer care afterwards\u201d", "Author": "ManuelMauriBrusa", "ReviewID": "UR24238412", "Content": "My girlfriend and I had the misfortune to experience an horrible stay at the H10 Marina Barcelona from November 25th to November 30th. I went to Barcelona for work and my girlfriend joined me 2 days afterwards to celebrate the first anniversary of our relationship, an anniversary that we will surely remember even though not in the positive way we had hoped for. The Hotel is not up to four-star standard. Although the staff was for the whole period of the stay very kind and professional, the facilities are to say the least very lacking and made our stay a complete nightmare. I work as a junior researcher while my girlfriend is a flight attendant. We are therefore used to constantly travel for work and have been in any kind of hotels all around the world. It was however the first time in our life we had such a terrible experience, having to change the room for four times in just five days! I will hereby shortly describe the problems which occurred during our stay. On the first day, I arrived late in the evening and was given a standard double room. While checking the room, I noticed there was quite a lot of dust under the bed, but did not complain because overall the room seemed ok, though quite cold. I therefore turned the heating on and went to sleep. During the night the room became colder and colder, and to my great displeasure I understood that the heating was in fact not working at all. I spent a night freezing, covered in all the blankets and quilts I could find in the room. The morning after, just before leaving for work, I informed the front desk of the problem and I was informed they would be giving me another room. When I came back in the afternoon, I re-packed the entire luggage I had just un-packed the evening before and moved to the new room. To my great disappointment I noticed that the room I moved into was in the corner of the building and therefore considerably smaller than the previous one and with only a small window while my previous room had a whole wall with windows. I am sure you will understand that, after spending a sleepless night in the cold in a four-star hotel the last thing I was expecting was a room down-grading. I informed the front-desk about the situation but was told that it was the only available room at the moment and that, even if clearly smaller, the room was still in the same room category as the previous room. I was then given the opportunity to move to a junior suite. Of course, the difference in room rates would be charged on my account. But since I was waiting for my girlfriend to celebrate our anniversary I decided to take the junior suite and just pay the difference. During the first night in the junior suite I understood that the hotel had problems with the central heating apparatus and not only with the heating in my previous room, and I spent another night sleeping in the cold. The next morning, while on the elevator, I discussed with other guests of the hotel who confirmed the heating was lacking in other rooms as well. This was confirmed by the front-desk staff \u2013and I wonder why I wasn\u2019t informed of this when I asked to change the room in the first place \u2013 but was assured the problem would be solved. Later that evening my girlfriend arrived and to our great pleasure the heating did as well. The junior suite room was, except for the heating system, in order and comfortable. On a side note, it was quite worrisome to notice that the electric panel behind the bathroom door was lacking its plastic cover and was exposed (room 911). The day after, while I was working, my girlfriend informed me there were other problems with the room. In fact our junior suite on the 9th floor was invaded by ants! She called the manager, who at first blamed us saying that it would be normal to have ants in our room since we had brought in food. We had indeed brought some tangerines, but the explanation did not seem very plausible to us; we usually have food in our homes in Switzerland, but this does not mean we all have ants at home. And we were in November. We were then once again moved to another room, this time a junior suite with balcony. Just after moving there, my girlfriend noticed there was water on the floor near the wall dividing the bathtub from the room. There was a water leak and water poured into the room. The manager sent a plumber to fix the leak and we were moved to another junior suite with balcony. The last junior suite with balcony indeed had a balcony. But this was flooded. The drain did not work and the balcony could not be used. The furniture inside the room was in bad shape. For example the mini-fridge\u2019s cupboard door did not close and the wainscots where all damaged and falling out. The water temperature in the shower kept on changing from freezing cold to boiling hot. We informed the front desk of this last point but nothing was done. But these were all minor problems compared to what we had been through to this point \u2013 though one would not expect this from a suite in a four-star hotel \u2013 and so we decided not to complain anymore and tried to enjoy, however possible, the rest of our short holidays. The last misadventures of our stay were that our room keys stopped working two days in a row (we were in room 804 at the moment the problem arose. We discovered that the guest staying in room 802 on Friday had the same problem with room keys which just quit working all of a sudden). And on the day of our leave, we discovered that we had been debited nearly 60 euro of expenses at the bar \u2013 were we had never been \u2013 on the 25th. We contested the debit and asked to see the receipt, which was not found and in the end the sum was taken out of our account. In conclusion, our stay at your hotel became a real nightmare. I want to underline once again that the staff was always very kind and professional (although they don\u2019t seem very keen on answering e-mails \u2013 I had asked to confirm if there would be any rate changes since I would be using the double room as single occupancy during the first 2 days and never got an answer; nor very flexible \u2013 we asked for a salad or sandwich through room service at 23.15 and were informed that would be impossible since room service ended at 23.00). But in general our experience in your hotel was really below that of a four-star standard. During our stay we took pictures to document the various problems described above which we will post on this website NOTE: I wrote to the customer care afterwards. They apologized deeply and said they would offer us a free stay. I contacted them about the free stay three times during the past month. They never answered a single e-mail of mine.", "Date": "February 5, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Newcastle upon Tyne", "Title": "\u201cGood breakfast!!\u201d", "Author": "Pinchy", "ReviewID": "UR24079773", "Content": "We stayed at this hotel for 3 nights about 2 weeks ago. We got a taxi from the airport to the hotel (which cost about 28 euros), and I was a bit surprised at the area, as there was quite a bit of graffiti. The hotel reception area is very bright and pleasant, and we were offered cava when we checked in. The underground (Bogatell) is a bit difficult to find, but once we got our bearings, it was only about a 8 minute walk from the hotel. I would be dubious walking around the area if I was on my own or with female friends, as it was quite deserted. Our room was fine, I did read other reviews regarding the air con, and this was not switched on when we were there, which meant we had to leave the window open to get some air into the place. It was a bit noisy with the traffic. As per previous reviews, the bed was hard, but I prefer that to a soft one. We had no problems with the bathroom. The hotel didn't seem particularly full so we didn;t hear any noise from the rooms around us. The breakfast buffet was very extensive and good quality, a bit steep at 17 euros per person I thought (luckily ours was included in our room rate) My only complaint is that the tables were very close to one another and you had to literally squeeze past the other table. The dropping rate of the euro has make a big difference, we went to Taller Tapas (food is really nice) where we had a bottle of wine, 5 lots of tapas and it cost 40 euros. We went for a pizza the following night and with wine, that was about 32 euros. We walked out of the hotel and hailed a taxi back to the airport, and it cost us 38 euros!!!

I agree with most other posters that the breakfast selection was beyond what we could have expected- it's definitely worth the additional amount to get the breakfast added as there is a great variety and it's great energy food to get you started on a day of sight-seeing. However, if you get to breakfast after 9, expect to be diappointed as the staff stops refreshing things after that point and everything gets pretty picked over. The food at the hotel (in the restaurant and wine bar) is overpriced, and not very good. But, the marina is just a 15-20 minute walk away with several good restaurants and pubs. Other than that, the hotel is not what I would consider to be \"centrally located\". The staff wasn't really helpful as the bulk of them were non-natives (from Cuba, Uruguay, etc.) who couldn't give any directions on where to go and what to see.

I'd give the Marina Barcelona a gold star however for its breakfast buffet which takes up 3 sides of the room: cooked breakfasts; home-made jams and cakes; croissants, Danish pastries and churros; rolls and bread; yogurts, cheeses and cold meats; cereals; fresh and cooked fruit; juices; lots of other things I can't remember.... and staff brought us jugs of coffee (which however we always sent back to be replaced by the hot version).", "Date": "March 31, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Jersey, Channel Islands", "Title": "\u201cModern hotel with no sound proofing\u201d", "Author": "sandrine_8", "ReviewID": "UR14685756", "Content": "We stayed 3 nights and I have to reach the conclusion that our next stay in Barcelona wont be in that hotel.

When I arrived at H10 Barcelona Marina Hotel I realized that the stars are not a good indicator of how good this hotel will be. This hotel has four stars, so I expected a really nice hotel with lots of amenities in a really nice place (I think the nicer the area the more you pay for it, and this was certainly not cheap by any means). Well, the area is disgusting. Hotwire said that it was in Ramblas, it is not, it is nowhere near Ramblas. There is also no description of the area in the hotel's website or on hotwire. The view from my window is a dumpster, literaly. It is a yard full of trash where there are homeless people living in plastic homes attached to the hotel (no kidding, it is a plastic cover that is held on to the side of the hotel). There are kids that live there (they look like homeless immigrants). These kids somehow can afford spray cans and so they spend most of the day painting graffitti on the walls all around the hotel. As you exit the hotel there is a big sign that was painted on by the lovely homeless neighbors and it says \"[--]\". If you have a translator you'll understand. When I complained to the manager about the graffitti and the terrible view she said that they could do nothing about the surroundings of the hotel. I find it hard to believe that as much as they charged for my two rooms the hotel cannot afford a brush and some paint and do something about the trash all around it. The room is nothing special by any means, the hotel seems remodeled but it is still old so our sink did not work and the furniture and lamps are overused and ugly. The beds are tiny twin beds and very hard. The breakfast is 17 euros per person, which turns out to be more than the room is worth. The indoors pool is 14 euros per person and for a one time use. Overall, you have to pay for anything they offer, except their crappy internet that only works every so often. In conclusion, were we come from (Florida), I would not stay in a hotel in an area like this, or even walk in an area like this one. When I explained this to the manager she said that the whole of Barcelona looks like this, and she was not kidding. Everywhere we went it smelled like sewers, piss, and dog crap. The houses look dirty and delapitated and it seems like the whole town ran out of paint because everything looks old and dirty. Everything is expensive and the only pretty parts are under constructions (including the cathedrals) so the pictures you take are of cranes in front of the buildings. From my experience at this hotel, I plan on booking my hotel rooms from other websites like orbitz where they show you what you'll get before you pay for it, and best of all, they do allow you to cancel and even refund you (unlike Orbitz).

Also had several encounters with staff where I found them to be rude and generally cranky The best thing about this hotel was the breakfast which was amazing the best ive had yet however the other factors far outweighed the benefits of the breakfast.

Pros: - area is very quite especially in the evening (for people who like to sleep) - nice breakfast (but no much variety within 5 days), still compliments to the restaurant staff; - the roomcleaners did their best, every day we got a tidy room. - very close to the harbour (ca. 10 min. walk, you should walk through the shopping mall at Av. Icaria) where you can go out for diner; Cons; - hard bed (but this is subjective) - no internet access for checking mail and online check-in - not so close to all the metro stations(at our last day we found out that the Marina Metro was closer than the Metro Citudella Vila Olympica); At station Marina you can also take the tram to the shopping mall av. Diagonall (Forum) - at the time we were staying, they were renovating the ground floor (in the middle of the tourist season!?) - the reception staff were fine, but we had one incident where we made an payment agreement with a female reception staff, but on that day she was not working, so we asked to the 2 male reception staff. And we ended in a discussion with 2 male reception workers (one was bold and the other had too much sun.) regarding some agreements we make at the beginning of our stay. I definitely advise you, when you make agreements (especially where money is involved), you should speak to the one who helped you and not someone different. Ofcouse at the end we get our money back.

Our room was one of the black glass fronted rooms on the corner of the hotel and was huge! The door opened into a light wooden floored entrance with the bathroom to the right.

The bed was very comfy, large, queen size bed. All very modern and might and bright. The only drawback was the heat from the large glass windows. We had to leave the curtains shut during the day to keep the sun out but there are really thick blackout curtain linings which made the room very dark and quiet. The Ac would only work when the room key was in the socket so the ac was off while we were out. Swimming pool was freezing!

So much choice, including champagne & fresh strawberries. (Have to say probably one of the best breakfasts we have ever had at a hotel). The hotel is a little out of the city centre, but a 10 min stroll brings you to Marina metro station and 3 stops into the centre. Some reviews have mentioned the run down look of the area which is true. I note one review from 2003 mentioned the area being this way and that it would perhaps be better in years to come! Fraid not! It's a case of manyana! It's a bit of a building site but that's the spanish way! Having been put off by the threat of pickpockets, have to say we did feel quite safe in the centre, obviously take care with your belongings. Would recommend a taxi to the hotel from the airport, cost the two of us \u20ac27, which when compared to our return journey on the train/metro was well worth it. Unfortunately we went home on the day of the Barcelona marathon and all major routes were closed, so the train was recommended!

From the moment of our arrival until our departure to the airport we received the very best service from all the staff; the staff were very child friendly and made us feel at ease. We stayed for four days and we made requests for warm milk and hot coco, both requests were swiftly met and in the evenings the staff were apologetic at having to apply the room service charge for such an inexpensive item. At the reception desk and in the internet/office support facilities I found the staff always helpful, knowledgeable and attentive.

The location is slightly quiet; so if you need to be in the throng of Barcelona then perhaps this is not the hotel for you.

They certainly were not child-friendly. They honestly looked horrified that my two year old son was with us. They scowled at him every time we walked through the lobby. \u00a8 The first night we were there we asked if there was a quick restaurant in the area that served simple, child-friendly food. Our son was tired and hungry and we just wanted to crash. Reception suggested that we eat in the hotel restaurant, but we wanted something a bit faster and less fancy. Reception was able to name two 4 star restaurants within a 15 minute walk, but the only simple restaurant that they could name was a 20 minute cab ride. We chose a direction, and began to walk, and within 5 miutes were able to find a perfecty fine place that served pizza. My son was happy. The room was fine, nothing special, although after a week in Paris it seemed especially spacious. There were some small things wrong, like loose bathroom fixtures and a slightly leaking sink, but we never called maintenance. The rooftop pool was nice (no kids, which I understand) and would have been nice to use at night, swimming in view of the Barcelona lights, but it closes at 6. Overall, this hotel seems uneven. Sitting in the lobby, I saw other couples check in that recieved very warm welcomes from the manager and several glasses of complimentary cava. Maybe they were as cold as they were because of the child? They really should take a cue from many other 4 and 5 star hotels, who will at least pretend to be welcoming to children.

In reality the location was actually ok and is a sensible compromise if you are looking to combine the cities culture with some relaxing on the beach. It was about 10 minutes walk to the Olympic Port and the beach. The walk was pleasant and there is plenty of bars and restaurants to choose from once you get there. At the Olympic Port you will also find a bus stop for the open top tour buses where you can hop on and off. The infamous Las Ramblas was quite a bit further but certainly walkable. We walked it a few times and our best time was about 30 minutes but if you take the scenic route round the ports etc you will be nearer an hour. We made the most of our tour bus tickets and just used and abused its service to get back and forth to Las Ramblas though. There is also a metro station a few minutes walk from the hotel but we never used it. The hotel was pleasant, very clean, and friendly. The room was spotless, comfortable, air conditioned, and had all the creature comforts you would expect in a 4 star hotel. The breakfast was undoubtedly the best buffet breakfast I ever had the pleasure of indulging in. There was fantastic choice and very efficient service. I really am being ridiculously fussy here but if I had to find a fault with the hotel I would say they needed more computers in the business centre.

Only complaint from the other half was the lack of a door to the toilet so I had to sit on the balcony while she did her business. The balcny on the junior suite was very large and was looking in the direction of the sea. You could see the olympic marina area and the distintive two tall buildings (one being The Arts Hotel). You could easily walk to the Marina area and along the beach front. This also takes you onto the Barcolenta (big marina area where all the yachts are moored) If feeling energetic you could walk to Las Ramblas, but taxis were also quite reasonable to get to and from both areas. Sagrada Familia and Parc Guell are definately a taxi ride as they are on the North of the city. Never ate in the restaurant at night but the breakfast was fantastic. All the usual english and continental options. There is a pool on the roof but the time of year we want we didn't brave the cold. If you like seafood the Olympic Marina area was the best we found. Check out the prices though as they can vary quite wildley. El Cangrejo Loco is a great place, fantastic service and food however be prepared for a \u00a3100+ bill for two if you're having a full meal and drinks. The bars around this area are worth just walking past, they are all small unit type things and there must be 10 or so packed closley together and they seem to have a passion for male and female bar dancers. Another favourite restaurant was as on the Passigo Gracia (probably spelt wrong), but it's the road with all the designer shops on. About 200m on the right (if coming from the main square end) there's a fantastic Tapas place. Looks like a grand deli from the front however there is a seating area at the back down some stairs.

The hotel bar was a friendly place to sit and chill in the evenings, with nice comfortable sofas and chairs.

Just returned from 3 nights at H10 Marina. The room was excellent, on the first floor and very well equipped. A HUGE bed as well!! As others have said the breakfasts are amazing. I have never seen such a wide choice of different foods. Nice to see the very healthy options too. I was a little apprehensive after reading other reviews re the area. However we did not find the area to be run down, admitted it was in a residential area and there was grafitti about. However, look around Barcelona and you will see quite a bit of \"grafitti\". It is not illegal over there and is encouraged, also it was more like art than grafitti. The only things we didn't like about the hotel were the over inflated bar prices. 19 Euros for 2 Gin and tonics and a small beer. Also we were half board and 2 nights of the 3, we got no choice in our starter or main course and were told what we would be having!! Also as others have said, the walls are thin and the hotel can be noisy at night. We did a full day Barcelona tour but would not recommend this. We were dropped off at the Spanish Village at 11.40, lunch was included and was scheduled for 13.00 and we were being picked up at 15.00 for the remainder of the afternoon tour. You can see all of the Spanish Village in half an hour so we were thoroughly bored, freezing cold and totally fed up being stuck there for all that time. We travelled about on the Metro, we had done lots of research on Barcelona and the scum people who pickpocket. We carried very little. However on the 2nd day, on the crowded metro, these scum attempted without success, to pickpocket hubby. Fortunately he had cottoned on very early that they were suspicious. They tried to move in behind him as though they were getting off the Metro, they hid their hands by carrying their jacket over them. When I say they, this was one guy who attempted this but there was 3 of them. They got off the metro, ran down the platform, and got back on the Metro further up. This sadly put a great dampner on the whole break and made me feel very uneasy for the rest of the time.

We returned to the Marina the following morning to be met by Allessandrsa again who welcomed us with a beaming smile and stated that she had a very good room for us. Indeed they did, we were put into one of the Junior suits on the tenth floor. What a room and what a view. Our stay in the hotel was very enjoyable. The staff were very friendly and although I attempted a little Spanish all staff cloud speak English very well. I had read a few reviews of the hotel on the web before going to Barcelona, some favourable, some critical. In brief - the hotel was excellent as were the staff. Breakfast was very good and the choice plentiful. The distance from the city centre I did not find too great, I enjoy walking and taking in the sights wherever I go. The nearest metro station was only five minutes walk away and although in a quiet area I never once felt threatened although my wife did say she felt uneasy. The graffitti never bothered me.

A very modern, big hotel with friendly enough staff. Don't expect the personal touch that you get in smaller hotels but it's run efficiently. Breakfast was fantastic. Roof top pool was nice, but small. The big problem with this hotel is it's location. Close to the beach (which isn't very clean by the way), the casino and the olympic port, but not close to anywhere else worth noting. The hotel is a 10 minute walk from the nearest Metro station, and it's not a very pleasant 10 minute walk after dark. It's based in the Olympic area of Barcelona which must have been impressive enough back in 1992, but unfortunately the area has been let go and looks a bit shabby by now. We didn't feel very safe in the hotel's neighbourhood after dark and used taxi's to get around. The hotel is a two minute walk away from a very daunting and grim looking prison. I wouldn't recommend this hotel for tourists who want to see the sights of Barcelona.

The bar is small with an unfriendly but attentive staff. Lots of other tourists were there (I think the 80 euros a night price was right for this four star hotel). The room was large, mattress was WAY too firm and the bathroom was sparse - but everything was well designed. Nice artwork. The staff was not good though - the told the wrong pick-up time for a cab we hired to take us to the airport and we had to pay for that time, they entered our room when the do not disturb sign was on, and they were overall rude at the bar. The check-in person was friendly and attentive though. I'd say go somewhere else because this place was so mediocre. It worked as a hotel, but didn't have any flare to it. Spend the extra couple of dollars and stay more central, closer to a metro stop. If you like the nightlife though, stay here. It's about two blocks away from the casino and Port Olympica.
