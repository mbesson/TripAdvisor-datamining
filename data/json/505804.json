We paid S$65 for the night on a layover which is pretty cheap for Singapore standards but it's further from the main sights and 10-15min walk from the closest MRT. The street the hotel is on is pretty dodgy with what looks like a street full of brothels and on the main room there are lots of girls standing around. Pros: Service at reception was pretty good, price is decent for Singapore standards as long as you know you get what you pay for (good for budget travelers). Cons: Hotel is in the red light district which made us question the cleanliness of the previous room patrons on the rubber mattress and thin (though looked and felt clean) sheets on the bed.

Arriving at the airport we enquired for a mid-range budget hotel only to find out most hotels were busy with guests stranded as a result of Qantas problems. So the only affordable hotel was Hotel 81 - Star. At SGD70 per night for a double room, it sounded reasonable and we booked for 2 nights. We were advised the money was non-refundable should we change our minds. This should have sounded alarm bells but we were tired after a long-haul flight and pleased to have found a hotel after all. When we gave the hotel name and address to the taxi driver he started laughing and asked why were we going there. Not a good omen. It turned out the hotel is based in Geylang, the red-light district. We were received by a grumpy receptionist who gave us our key and advised that the money we paid for 2 nights were non-refundable. On the way to the room, we noticed signs in the lifts advising patrons to inform reception of any cars left parked outside in order to avoid clamping. Why would anyone take their car and stay at a hotel we wondered? Why, this was a hotel where locals came with working girls for a couple of hours, had their bit of fun and then went back to their wives and kids. Lovely. The room was about the size of a shoe-box, with beds with plastic mattresses (so they don't get stained, of course - yuck!!!). All night long we heard customers coming and going, the lovely click-clack of high-heeled shoes, the laugher of the girls... The second night we had the pleasure of hearing our next-door neighbour doing the deed - over and over again. Needless to say, we looked into moving to another hotel, at the peril of losing our money for the 2nd night in Hotel 81-Star. But we couldn't find anything under SGD240 and it felt like too much money, especially that we were at the beginning of our holidays. On the morning we left, the staff even refused to call a cab for us. They said it'd cost us SGD5 for the service. Lovely!!! So we walked, found a cab - in all fairness we found it pretty quickly - and never looked back. Singapore is interesting, but it doesn't have a patch on Saigon or Bangkok. But that's another story, of course. The only positive thing was the location of this hotel - about 10-15 min away from the MRT train station, and about 4 stops away from the centre. Unless you're a single guy, looking for a bit of fun (paid for, of course), don't go to any of the Hotel 81 branches. Pay more and stay in a decent hotel or don't bother going to Singapore at all.", "Date": "January 3, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "1", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Location": "3", "Rooms": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "malaysia", "Title": "\u201cExpect the unexpected!\u201d", "Author": "kopibreak", "ReviewID": "UR91099163", "Content": "Location - good Room - small and bugs problem out of control Try to avoid it as this hotel is in the middle if red light district!

Also, there are plenty of decent restaurants nearby where you can get a meal that is quick, tasty, and cheap--certainly better than most hotel breakfasts.

As other reviews have mentioned, it's located in the red light district where prostitution is legal. The hotel rooms are very small, but for the price, I wouldn't have expected anything bigger. The room is not significantly larger than the bed. The bathroom is small, but clean. The shower is one of those that doesn't have a curtain or anything separating it from the rest of the bathroom, so the water does get all over the bathroom floor. It's because of this that I think the room would be uncomfortable for two people to share, because you have to dry off the floor and everything before anyone else can go in there and it's not big enough to change clothes in the bathroom after you shower. For a single person, it was fine. For two people sharing a room, I would recommend checking out the other hotels in this area (they are all similarly priced) to see if some of them have separate showers with curtains. The hotel staff were friendly enough, and I only saw one prostitute in the hotel the three days I was there. There were plenty of people staying in the hotel, but I found that the vast majority of them were just normal budget travelers and families trying to save some money. I never heard any of *that* kind of noise, but I had preemptively turned the TV way up the whole time I was in the room because of the other reviews on here. The Geylang area is great in the daytime. I felt safe walking around as a single woman. It's less than ten minutes to walk to the Aljunied MRT train station, and there are tons of popular hawker centers in the area where you can get good quality Chinese and Indian food for less than $4 a meal. Nighttime in this area is a different story, and sadly, it's a relatively small number of people who ruin it for everyone else. Even at night, most of the people here are just normal people who are eating or going about their normal business. There are quite a few prostitutes, but I found that their tactic for attracting business is to just dress in a way that makes it clear they're prostitutes and wait for men to approach them. They don't go around harassing people unwantedly, and they seem to just stay in small groups talking to each other until they are approached. What really bothered me was the sleazy, sleazy men in this area, who are a hundred times more obnoxious than the hookers and WILL approach strangers. Apparently it's not clear to some men that a red light district means you can legally get hookers. It doesn't mean you can pay ANYONE for sex, and these men will not hesitate to proposition a random tourist. I was dressed very conservatively, in jeans, flip flops, and an Adidas t-shirt, carrying shopping bags and looking VERY much like a tourist. As I was crossing a busy street in Geylang, an older man ogled me in a way that made me very uncomfortable. He kept walking next to me and staring. I sternly told him to leave me alone, and he took that as his cue to offer me $100. I made a scene in hopes that he'd go away. I yelled, \"GET AWAY FROM ME! I AM NOT A PROSTITUTE! YOU'RE DISGUSTING!\" He kept walking near me, so I ran into a 7-11, hoping he'd just keep walking and forget about me. I came out of the store ten minutes later, and he was still there and tried to talk to me again. I yelled again and told him to leave me alone, and at that point he realized that I was serious. It was this experience that will make me not stay in this area again. Next time, I'll just pay extra and stay in a better area. It's a shame, because the hotel itself was fine, and the vast majority of people in this area were nice and normal. I guess I would only recommend this hotel to men traveling alone, friends, couples on a tight budget, or families whose children are too young to understand what prostitution is.", "Date": "May 27, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "2", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Nerw Zealand", "Title": "\u201cGood value in Singapore\u201d", "Author": "MrFo5", "ReviewID": "UR15452164", "Content": "Good location for us.
