We choose one over looking the pool that had a rancid musty odor. The smell was afoul but after 30 minutes or so in the room you tend to notice it less. They must have a light bulb issue. At night walking to the room all the lights on the path were out. Then we got to our room and the reading lamp was missing a bulb. We went down to the desk and asked for one and they said they would bring it up. After 30 minutes we fun another hallway and removed a bulb and they never did end up bringing the bulb. I am not a picky traveler but this place is maybe worth 50 USD a night and NOT 130. We should have stayed at Gladys Guest house for under 50. Oh and I read the reviews about the restaurant. Well I guess it was so bad it went out of business because there is no restaurant on the premises however their sign out front still boasts they have a restaurant.", "Date": "February 19, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "2.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Puerto Rico", "Title": "\u201cgo some place else\u201d", "Author": "Roly_movie", "ReviewID": "UR14775038", "Content": "The hotel has excelent location, but poor administration don't eat in the restaurant \"la pared\" service is terrible... go eat at \"sangria co\u00c3\u00b1o\" place is more native (macheteros) better to go Ponce holiday inn or villa parguera hotel.

We arrived and thought it would be okay, since the outside and back patio of the parador looked decent. First of all, the girl working at the front said it was her first day at the desk. She said that she normally worked in their restaurant (which, by the way, does not open during the weekdays; only only sat & sun; but you will notice that this is not what is advertised on the sign out front: see pic). She gave us a room that was supposed to be one of their high end rooms. It was horrible!!! There were tears in the rug, and it was the size of a small dorm room. Not to mention, the ugly decor. We went right back down and complained and they gave us another room (not ocean front as we paid for), facing the street. The room was a 2 on a scale of 1-10. The room itself \"appeared\" clean. The toilet was filthy, and the coach had a few stains. Because it was too late to find another hotel and it didn't seem like there would have been anything better, since La Pagueria is such a small town, we decided to stay. Never again will we stay here.", "Date": "March 29, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "2", "Check in / front desk": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Connecticut", "Title": "\u201cTerrible experience\u201d", "Author": "nathayes", "ReviewID": "UR14217969", "Content": "The place is very run down and is in serious need of a major renovation.

The rooms come with TV, a private bath (shower only, no tub) and are air conditioned. The rooms are simple. You won't find fluffy towels or chocolates on the pillow, just a simple, clean, room and bath. I have only stayed in the top two floors. There are two lower floors as well. After I made my reservation with the dive shop for this third trip, I received a call notifying me that there would be live music on the weekends and was given the opportunity to cancel. I decided to keep my room and am glad I did since the music was not loud. The inn is near several restaurants and bars and two small markets as well . A pharmacy is nearby for your convenience. I only ate in the hotel restaurant once because I received a meal voucher for $25. The food was quite good, but I felt it was a little pricey. This is a great \"bang for the buck\" as long as you are not looking for luxury. The dive shop itself is outstanding. Angel Rovira runs a first class operation.

He explained that Americans don't normally go there, it is more of a local vacation spot. I hoped that the diving would be all that I imagined. It was. The owner of the dive shop on the premise of Posada Polamar, Angel, is extremely knowledgeable and very safety minded. I dove six days with him and his crew (Victor is also an awesome dive master) I was constantly amazed at Angel's knowledge and ability to draw a good laugh. While diving I saw two barracuda's and one shark as well as the assortment of eels, tropical fish and one of the most beautiful walls. One mistake I made is booking the cheapest room (this was quickly upgraded by the hotel after I complained). The first floor rooms really are not good rooms. Do yourself a favor and make sure your room is not on the first floor (1XX). The food in the hotel was the best I could find in La Parguera. Make sure you give the Paella a try!! (hint: don't eat at the Steak restaurant across the street from the hotel...trust me on this one) Great dives, great food.

The rooms are not fancy but the A/C works and we stayed on the top floor which had great views. It is nice to roll out of bed and walk down to the dive boat to do your diving. The hotel serves breakfast which is included and give one dinner which was included. breakfast wasn't fancy (either fresh eggs, frozen eggo waffles, or frozen eggo pancakes) but the dinner is very fancy and expensive. Actually they gave a $50 voucher for the dinner and you'll spend over that. If you are diving, definitely stay there.
