We stayed in unit #43 which had 3 bedrooms and 2 baths, spacious living area, dining area, and full kitchen. Our unit was very clean and comfortable with pretty much everything you would need during your stay. The only things you need to provide are every day essentials such as toilet paper, paper towels and any cleaning supplies or soaps/detergents. I just wish I knew this when I booked so I could have brought some things with me from home instead of having to buy everything, but no big deal. Also, be sure to bring some extra washcloths from home so you won't have to do laundry every couple of days, they only provide 6 or 8. The complex is about 10 minutes from the parks and other attractions, has a heated pool and jacuzzi, and provides wifi at the club house. We were 4 adults traveling (my self & husband and both of my parents) the only thing that I could really complain about was the beds being a little small. The options were, queen, full or 2 double beds, both couples were used to a king size bed so one couple didn't sleep very well. I would suggest requesting an upstairs unit away from the road for adults traveling without small children. You will definitely be able to hear the people above you if you are on the first floor. You might also hear some road noise unless you are further on the inside of the property. Over all, I would definitely stay again or recommend to friends and family.", "Date": "February 5, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Sunderland, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cExcellent base for parks, give it a go!\u201d", "Author": "tom_h33", "ReviewID": "UR120545051", "Content": "It is worth pointing out prior to this review that each of the condos' situated on the Sweetwater Club estate are independently owned, this review refers to number 42. This was the first time that my family and I had booked out vacation home without the assistance and relative safety of a travel agent and I have to say that I was apprehensive however the owners made the whole process as easy as it could be. The condo itself is superbly situated just of the 192 in the heart of everything. Disney is just 10 minutes by car, Seaworld and Universal Studios are 15 minutes and there are any amount of restaurants practically on your doorstep. The condo itself is very clean and well presented as well as providing everything you could need during your stay (including travel cots and car seats) and the owners were very responsive to my requests prior to our trip and stayed in communication throughout, even providing an information pack to assist us in our planning. So to recap, if you are looking for a base for your Orlando/Disney vacation that is clean, comfortable and homely then you couldn't get much better.", "Date": "November 13, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Holmdel, New Jersey", "Title": "\u201cExcellent home to finish off the day\u201d", "Author": "P Lloyd L", "ReviewID": "UR119627100", "Content": "I rented a 3 bedroom home in Sweetwater Club and i have to tell you it was great.

We arrived to a dirty entrance way, ceramic tile floors were filthy. White socks became brown after a very short time walking around the condo. cob webs everywhere, and broken tv remote. Im sorry but when I'm on vacation I don't expect to lift a finger to enjoy the accomodations. We paid good money to have this unit available. We were however pleased with the kitchen and the amenities it offered, well equipped. We were very disappointed with the security of the complex, 4 nights into our stay someone broke into my personal minivan in the parking lot and stold many of our personal things, when I asked the management if there was anything they could do they simply replied no. Call the police. There is a sign that says property under 24 hour video surveillance. I suppose thats just for asthetic purposes. As I said we found the place to be filthy, with previous occupants hair everywhere. We arrived a little early at Florida Vacation Villas as we drove down and allowed plenty of extra time, so we took or chances checking in at 12 noon to my surprise the unit was supoosedly ready, had I known it was filthy prior to check in we would have glady waited the extra time to allow them to prepare it for my family and I.

It\u2019s important that you are aware that all units are individually owned and therefore individually styled and cared for. As we understand it, the owner\u2019s employ different management companies to manage clean, maintain the properties. Our particular condo we hired was through www.going2orlando.com Sweetwater is in a great position in a quiet location just off the main road that runs through Kissimmee (highway 192) with lots of shopping and restaurants and about 20mins drive to Disney and the other parks. Our unit was a spacious 3 bedroom with all the amenities you need; a large living space, TVs in living area and two of the bedrooms (with plenty of channels to choose from). A fully equipped kitchen including a microwave, dishwasher plus a washing machine and a dryer. The master bedroom had a lovely king size bed with the most comfortable mattress I have ever slept on (which I said to my husband every single night) the two other bedrooms were a twin room and a double room, there is also a small balcony/terrace out the back of the master bedroom. What we found really useful was they had all the little extras you need ie, washing up liquid, washing powder, dish washer tablets, cleaning up sponges, kitchen role and hand wash in the bathrooms and toilet paper. Plus there were always plenty of towels and extra blankets and pillows. The grounds are well kept and the pool area is well maintained. There was also a volleyball court and tennis courts. The clubhouse staff were always courteous and helpful, and complimentary coffee was available throughout the morning, \u2018Flor\u2019 (clubhouse lady) was particularly pleasant and very helpful and made us feel right at home. I can\u2019t stress enough that these units are individually owned and managed (even though a number of units could be managed by the same management company). Therefore the cleanliness and overall perception of the condo will ultimately rest with the management company. This seems to be quite evident from the inconsistent reviews so far. With this in mind I can only form an opinion that some management companies are far better than others. From personal experience we can safely say that block unit 42 managed by [--] was a lovely place to stay and would regard Sweetwater as our second home. Don\u2019t just take our word for it, have a look at the pictures attached. If you choose to leave a review for Sweetwater \u2013 please include the block number and unit number you stayed in plus the company you used to book with \u2013 this will highlight the good, the bad and the ugly\u2026and in turn help future visitors select well kept clean condos.", "Date": "October 26, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Check in / front desk": "2", "Overall": "2.0", "Rooms": "1", "Value": "2", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "NJ", "Title": "\u201cNot what I expected\u201d", "Author": "Lovetotravelnj", "ReviewID": "UR5805162", "Content": "I came back from Florida today. The location is good (close to highway 192). The entrance to the Villas seemed inviting enough but the entrance to the unit I stayed was a different case. There were dirt, spider webs and various bugs all over the place. Upon entrance, the tiles in the living area appear clean. The kitchen was clean and furnished with full refrigerator, dishwasher, range and microwave. The unit had a coffee maker that had ground -in dirt - had to be sanitized before use. The unit had two TVs and a VCR (never tried the VCR). It claimed to have cable but there was no CNN. Local calls were supposed to be free but there was no access - it prompts you for credit card for the local calls. The towels and beddings were dingy. I had to wash these in the dated washing machine (rusty) before using them. The sofa and couch and the dining chairs were faded and dingy. I had to lay a sheet on the sofa. The bathrooms looked like they were cleaned but not thoroughly. There were spiders and ants crawling all over. I had to clean the bathrooms before using them. There were missing or mismatch window screens. The gardeners left dirt on the walkway and when I spoke to the manager after the 3rd day, he told me to get a broom from the unit and clean it myself. The wireless does not work in the units. The clubhouse computer is extremely slow and the use is $5/30 mins. The vacation was supposed to be for rest and relaxation but I did more work cleaning up than resting. I had to cut short my vacation and paid extra to fly back home early.

Great location, 2 minutes from the main street in Kissimme (highway 192) with lots of shopping and restaurants and only a quick drive to Disney and the other parks. Good size condo, great bedroom sizes, one with 2 twin beds, one with a queen and walk-in closet, and a master with queen bed, balcony, walk-in closet, and ensuite bath with shower only. Bathrooms are pretty dated, cracks in the caulking, cupboards very dated, floors cracking, showers moldy. The worst part was the window in the ensuite shower must have been put in backwards, because you can't see out the window but people outside can see you, so look out ladies!!! Couldn't get the DVD player working so we didn't get to enjoy that, but there was a VCR. Pool was good, warm. Hot tub very relaxing. Except they kick you out about 15 minutes before closing time! Kitchen facilities were perfect, except again counters and cupboards were very dated. Other than those minimal things, we had a pretty good time.
