Very pretty lobby and design. Definitely can tell it used to be a department store (in a good way). I immediately asked the person at check-in about the smell (told him I read reviews about it) and requested a room without the issue. He said ok and told me that he thinks they resolved the problem. We didn't have any odor issues in our room (room 429). The room was a little small but adequate and clean. Nice Bath & Body Works toiletries. We didn't have any issues with hot water at all. It is true that there are no outside windows for king rooms. It wasn't really a problem for us but it was very easy to oversleep in the morning and lose track of time so just set your alarm. Yes, the walls were pretty thin but we didn't have too many issues with noise at all. It was pretty quiet. The location was FANTASTIC!!!! That's the best thing about this hotel. Within walking distance of everything (Bourbon Street, River Walk, etc.) but far enough away that you didn't have to deal with the noise at night. The walk also seemed pretty safe. I would suggest riding the Magazine St streetcar/trolley through the Garden District and to the Audubon Zoo and Park. The zoo was great. Bourbon Street is exactly what you imagine if you've never been there. A big frat party with bad smells but good for drinks and people watching. Most of the venues on Bourbon Street are more like nightclubs with party music. If you want jazz bands your best bet is to walk to some other places in the French Quarter off of Bourbon. We didn't eat at the hotel restaurant...there are too many great places to eat in NOLA.

It gets great pluses for being in one of the best locations. A 2 block walk to catch the trolley and a 3 block walk to the French Quarter. It was also an easy walk to the Civil War and WW2 Museums. The beds were so comfy and they have room darkening shades which helped when needing to nap after an early flight into town. The one big drawback is the towels which are about the worst I've ever had in a hotel. This is what keeps the rating at 3 stars for me. The bathroom as well as the shampoo, conditioner, and lotion were fine so I'm not sure why they scrimped on the towels. The hotel also has a fitness room but it's very limited in size with 1 treadmill, 2 bikes, and 2 stair machines. The treadmill was broken and one of the bikes had a broken seat that would not lock in place. I also had trouble getting hot water on the first day, but the maintenance man came to my room and fixed the problem. They have a coffee shop which serves Starbucks coffee but in terms of hotel bar or restaurant, this hotel is very no frills. There's a Sushi restaurant next door which has a separate entrance from the street but you can also get to it through the hotel lobby.

Traveling on a business trip, I got this room in a prime spot near the French Quarter for $84 per night and it was a very good value for the price. The pros: The Wyndham Garden is clean, centrally located and has a good range of standard business travel facilities, including a well-equipped workout room and good - if not great - Wi-Fi performance. The king-size bed in my room was quite soft, which is not ideal if you have a bad back, but the down comforter was a great touch. There are excellent restaurants within just a couple blocks and Bourbon Street is a five-minute walk, if you're into that scene. Personally, I'd just as soon avoid the tourist meccas and explore some of the lovely parks and beautiful architecture around the French Quarter. Those are also a short walk. The cons: A lot of the rooms at the Wyndham Garden face inward, making it impossible to tell whether it's day or night. I love a plush towel, and the bath towels at the Wyndham were surprisingly chintzy and small. My room was also freezing. Even with the air conditioning set at the highest temperature, I doubt the room got much above 68\u00c2\u00b0. I couldn't figure out how to make the alarm clock work and the face isn't illuminated, making it impossible to read at night.

I was surprised how close it was to Bourbon Street (1 block from Canal St, another block to Bourbon). It is the site of one of 6 hotels built in New Orleans during the 1930's and was a Sears Department Store before converting to a Hotel. Just across the street is one of the oldest churches (Jesuit) in downtown. The hotel is surrounded by tall commercial buildings with no dark alleys to Canal St. People/Staff are helpful, friendly, and try to please. The price is very attractive for the location. The hotel rooms are interesting because they are inside the building, with windows viewing the inside not the outside. If you open up the window curtains, you will see the windows of other rooms on several floors. The rooms are well appointed, with flat panel TV's and a soft bed. Free USA Today's are available at the front desk. The restaurant is a sushi restaurant that was reasonably priced. For the price, the hotel is a good value. My negatives start with hot water. It took over 4 minutes at full throttle to get hot water both in the tub and sink. I called the front desk, who were very accommodating and understanding, and they gave me the choice to move or wait for maintenance to fix it. I waited, but it still did not work. No blame, just what happens when you have a room without many people on the floor getting up early. Also, the door did not close tightly, so I have to make sure the door was totally closed and locked before I locked it. I was awoken twice in the middle of the night (1am & 3am) as people coming back from festivities were banging on their doors to be let in for bed. Then they would turn on the TV loudly.. so you can hear neighbors two rooms down. I would stay again, but maybe request a room away from traffic.

Parking would be my only issue but it's worth it since its easier to just walk everywhere than to drive and try to find parking. It is an EXTRA TIGHT space getting around down there (It's under the hotel) so if you have a large truck or SUV OR if you're not so good at parking, you might want to check with the hotel on whether your vehicle will fit or make sure you get there early to get a easy parking space.

The room was facing the street and a loading dock of the hotel across the street so it was very loud during the night and early morning. The beds were very comfortable and the shower was great. Two days in we asked if a king had become available and sure enough it did and we were able to switch rooms. All king rooms are located on the inside of the building so the window does not face outside, which is something I usually hate, but the room was so quiet that it was a great trade off. The king room was slightly smaller than the double room, but just as comfortable. Free Wi-Fi is a plus. There is a little cafe in the lobby that brews Starbucks coffee (but it is not actually a Starbucks), the coffee was good and they had some fruit and yogurt you can buy. However on the corner there is a Subway so you could get a cheap egg sandwich for a quick bite.

Due to the Voodoo Music Festival there were no bed & breakfasts available at a decent price so we had to settle for a hotel. The building's architecture is beautiful, but the way the rooms were made isn't the best. The walls are paper thin. We could hear the next door's tv. Not the most romantic of settings. The room smelled a peculiar way. The bathroom and bed were comfortable. The toiletries were nice. The customer service at the front desk left a little to be desired...let's just say the conversation upon our arrival was unprofessional at best...not what one expects from a Wyndham hotel. Overall it was ok since we were only there for the night, but I wouldn't recommend it to anyone for a long stay. The location was good because we could walk to Bourbon Street, Riverfront area, and since it's in the financial district then there was no noise from the street. The noise came from the other people in the hotel. We were awakened early by children slamming doors in our hallway. Another thing that wasn't mentioned in the hotel's website, and I didn't see in the prior reviews here, is that they charge $20 for parking.

The hotel is not hard to find if you're looking for Common and Baronne. Chances are you may come down O'Keefe, there is a parking garage near there that was $15/day. If you're coming down Canal, turn down Baronne and then back up Common (first block from Canal). The hotel is about 2 blocks from the foot of Bourbon Street. Easy access to everything, easy to walk to everything. Didn't feel unsafe at all. Streetcars are about a block east (to Canal) and south (to Carondelet). The building is an old Art Deco building. It used to be a Sears but you're never tell. The interior is pretty immaculate, highly worthy of 5 star ratings. It is only 5 stories high so don't let the open atrium concern you. Some rooms do have windows that open to the atrium instead of outside. This wouldn't bother me unless I just had to have a view. And even then the view isn't that great to begin with. We had a corner room on the 5th floor looking out to the corner of Baronne and Common. Nothing much going on there but buildings. The room was pretty big, plenty of room. The bathroom was huge. They had 'complimentary' water sitting in the room but I never asked if that meant it was free so we didn't open it. There was no microwave or fridge in the room, but ice and vending was on every floor, usually a short walk. The one oddity we experienced (or at least others in my party did), was the hot water. Supposedly the water would either warm up or it would get cold during the shower. I had a hard time duplicating this but did note that once the water did start to cool off during the shower, but I just turned the knob further and it warmed up again. I had plenty of hot water. The beds are super soft and sink in. Some people love this and others hate it. I found them very comfortable. Same deal with the pillows. Very comfortable. For breakfast, there is an IHOP across Canal Street. But let me suggest the Streetcar Cafe also. It's a block down on Carondelet and they have always been great. It was a little slower this time because we ordered some grits and they were a little slow in making them (had to cook more), so the service was a little slower than before, but the food was still great. I'd eat there again, and again. We did not eat in the sushi bar at the hotel or try any of the other amenities. I found the staff to be very friendly though and generally always smiling. We had a room with two double beds. The beds do feel like they sit a little high but still comfortable. There is parking but when I got there I couldn't figure out how to use their garage anyway, so I ended up next door, cheaper. Be warned, take your ticket or you may get locked out of the garage after hours. But of course you could just walk up the in ramp like I did, walk to the 2nd floor and then get in the elevator there to continue up. All in all, a very fine NOLA stay.

During the hotter months, try to get a room on the lower floors. The heat collects in the 5th floor hallways. The restaurant is not one. It is a place where you can get pre-prepared sandwiches and drinks. There is a Sushi restaurant connected directly to the hotel lobby. Do not recommend the Sushi restaurant. Location, location, location. This place has it. One block off of Canal Street. One block south of Bourbon Street. Easy walking distance to the tourist section of Bourbon Street.

The Wyndham Garden Hotel is a five minute walk from Bourbon Street in the French Quarter, but does not have the party noise of that area. It is also within walking distance of the Convention Center and other hotels where my husband attended conferences. The front desk staff is very friendly and helpful. They were very knowledgeable and answered our many questions with lots of patience. I can't say as much for the housekeeping staff who must have had a bad day (or week). Let's just say they did not display the friendliness that I associate with New Orleans. The hotel lobby is very clean and inviting. It has different seating areas so people can visit and have meetings or simply watch the basketball game. I loved the display of the city in miniature. We got upgraded to a suite which was an inside room, with a window facing toward the landing which looks down into the lobby. We kept the curtains closed because of people walking by to their rooms. Even with the curtains open, the room is very dark and lights are required all the time. The room was very quiet, and even the sound of people walking by was muted. The king size bed was very comfortable with nice linens. It was easy to oversleep (as we did) in that dark and quiet room. The room had two flat screen TVs, one for the bed and the other for the little sitting area. Now for the dings: The whir of small refrigerator was a bit distracting at times. The carpeting looked dated and had a couple of stains. The large bathroom had an odd shower stall design with a tile step up into the shower. This could be a hazard for elderly people and impossible to get into for disabled people. The bathtub was large, but the long black hair on the bottom of the tub was a definite turn-off. The tile floor in the bathroom looked like it needed a good scrubbing. I did not want to walk on that floor on my bare feet. The first two days the tissue box was empty, until I placed the container on top of the toilet so housekeeping could not miss it. It was replenished. There was no bath mat, and I had to use one of the towels to prevent slipping on a wet floor. Only on the second to the last day of our stay were plastic drinking cups placed by the ice bucket. The ice bucket was never checked for melted ice. These were all minor issues, but put together they forced me to deduct some points because it showed a carelessness that should not happen in a nice hotel.

The furniture is scarred and there are stains on the walls, trash cans and furniture. (This description is for the first and second room I stayed.) The folks were nice but not really responsive. The toilet in the first room would run for several minutes to an hour after flushing. The tank contained a super flush system so there was nothing I could do on my own, ie could not put the flap down or anything. I called a few times to complain and finally on the fourth day of the visit, they sent someone one up to take a look even though a note was left the night before stating I wanted someone to take a look the next day. Of course the toilet stopped running by the time the manager arrived and when he flushed it a few times, it would stop relatively quickly. He asked me if I wanted to change rooms to which I said no because I did not want to be inconvenienced by having to move everything. The last time he flushed it he waited a few minutes then said well it seems to be working and left. The toilet continued to run after he left so I waited 10 mins then called down to tell them the toilet was still running. The manager arrived, went into the bath and within a minute of his arrival, the toilet stopped. So this time it ran for approximately 15 mins before stopping. The manager said, well it seemed to have stopped, let me time it. I stated, you flushed before left, how long were you gone. He said, 7-8 mins, I said more but either way, now it's just stopping. No matter how long it takes to stop, the point is that it's taking longer than it should so timing it is not an adequate troubleshooting method. Someone needs to look inside the mechanism. Long story short, the manager had no idea of what he was doing so I said, yeah, go ahead and move me. So I moved to a room that smells like wet, musty socks.

The staff member advised by taxi, and knew the rates of cabs and shuttles etc. He also said that they could help out with the various tours available. We arrived quite early (11 am or so) but a room was ready. The check was very smooth with friendly staff. The room was very good. It was clean, seemed to have a new mattress, because it was very comfortable. The bathroom seemed to have been renovated recently, was clean and well appointed. There was no problem with either hot water or water pressure. The air conditioning worked almost too well. The hotel was converted many years ago from a Sears Store, so the layout is different. Many of the rooms have windows that only open to an indoor atrium. It seems odd that you have to get dressed and go downstairs to see the weather.

An easy five minute walk puts you in the heart of this activity. From a price standpoint, the hotel was easily the best price for comparable type lodging that we found. My room was clean, smelled fresh and, had a modern bathroom with a forceful shower with quick water heat up. The room was serviced promptly and thoroughly each day. It was not the largest, but, if one doesn't intend to spend a whole lot of time in the room other than sleep and shower, who cares? Our floor was very quiet, and I never heard a sound from any other room. Our interactions with staff were pleasant and they seemed generally helpful, though one minor issue came when I asked to change a $100 bill and it could not be accomplished. This was unfortunate as the lobby ATM had a $3.50 fee. We asked for some directions one day which were accurate and delivered with a smile. Front desk personnel arranged for a cab to drive us to MSY the final morning, and the cab was out front of the hotel, right on time. The breakfast looked OK, but recommend, if you have time, you check out \"Mothers\" or \"Daisy Duke's\" for relatively close by home cooked type breakfasts.

The art deco qualities of the original building have been maintained and echoed in the newer interior construction. The downside of turning a big-box store into a hotel is that many of the rooms have windows that face only onto a hallway or the interior atrium that has been carved out of the center. On the positive side, you are protected from outside city noises; on the negative side, you never know if it's day or night, sunny or rainy. The other downside is that these interior rooms have no bathroom ventilation, so mirrors steam up instantly during a shower and bathroom smells do not easily dissipate. We got a great deal through Expedia the week after Mardi Gras ($54 per weeknight for a room with king-size bed), and for the first part of our stay we seemed to be among only a handful of guests. But then the weekend guests arrived... perpetually drunk 20-somethings who loudly roamed the halls pounding on random doors. I suspect this is a common problem for any hotel offering cut-rates in proximity of Bourbon Street on weekends. Other positives... the bed was very comfortable, and the rooms have flat-screen TVs and free wi-fi. Other negatives: the cheesiest made-in-India soap and amenities. There is a not-very-inviting sushi restaurant off the lobby. People have complained of bad service, but we found desk staff mostly very friendly and accommodating. The big negative for us... negative enough that I'd likely not stay there again... is that while waiting in the lobby for an early morning taxi to the airport, the security guard (keeping an eye on the comings and going of the drunken young people from the concierge station) volunteered his extreme ANTI-GAY sentiments to us uninvited.

After reading many reviews, I was a little weary. But still decided to stay at the Baronne. I booked through the hotel online and received the November specials rate. The room came at a very reasonable price. The outside of the building is nothing spectacular, however the lobby and the interior decorations of the lobby and sitting area really make up for the exterior of the building. There is a parking garage underneath the building. The garage is convenient as you have easy access to your vehicle at any time you want and you have the comfort of knowing it is not parked in a parking garage some four blocks away. The hotel has been very recently renovated and it looks great. The rooms are very clean and large. We stayed in a room with two double beds and an outside view (it seems as if these might be a bit larger). There was a desk, a chair, an ottoman, and a flat screen TV. A huge plus - the large amounts of electrical outlets in the room (a plus for four girls!) The bathroom was nice as well. The towels weren't that large, but when we asked for more immediately housekeeping arrived with some. The bed and pillow are unbelievably comfortable! No parts of the room seemed unclean or unkept. My ONLY complaint is that I could not connect to wireless in my room. There were many (about 20) signals that my computer picked up on, but none were even a little strong enough to work. However, I went down to the lobby and picked up on a strong signal. The free breakfast in the morning was yummy! Coffee, juice, milk, bagels, waffles, eggs, bacon, cereal, fruit, etc. The staff at the hotel and the breakfast are very friendly. The hotel's restaurant opened the Saturday night of our stay, but we did not try it. It is a sushi restaurant and smelled tasty! During our stay one morning, a few rooms down from ours, a group of men and women began arguing VERY loudly in the hall. This was around 8:00 in the morning. Very quickly, the hotel staff took care of this problem and called the police who immediately came and seemed to be issuing tickets. I was quite impressed with the way the hotel handled the disturbance. The Baronne Plaza is only about 3 blocks from Bourbon and just one block from Canal. We walked to the square a few times easily in about 15 minutes. The location is safe and located around many other hotels. There is also a Walgreen's only one block from the hotel on Canal street. A subway and a few finer restaurants are also located within one block of the hotel. I would recommend this hotel to families, friends, and anyone looking for a clean, reasonably priced location.

Taxi fares were not too bad from the convention center, when the shuttle was unavailable. Because the hotel is converted from a non-hotel use, rooms were not uniform in size. Some of the double rooms were a bit small and perhaps should have been singles. The largest double room did not have hot enough water (it may have been furthest from the water heater on the floor , but is not unique to this hotel -- I have had this happen at other hotels; check your shower when you arrive and switch rooms, if necessary), but the people in the room stayed there, because they liked having a big room. That being said, we were pleased overall with our rooms. The single I had included a bathroom nearly as big as the rest of the room. The bathroom floors are a marble-like material, so can be a bit cold, but it was better than having tile, which can be difficult to keep clean in the recessed edges of each tile. The 'dresser' was four low drawers that had a padded cushion on top for extra seating in the room for visitors -- a nice feature for when our group gathered. All staff were extremely helpful. Our rooms were clean and the areas outside the rooms were also clean. All our rooms were interior rooms facing out to an atrium open to all floors, with my room being immediately adjacent to the elevator. There was extra noise as people came and went, but not to the point where it disturbed me once I was asleep. The hotel, however, was not as full as during a more popular time like Mardi Gras. With the location near Bourbon street, one should expect more noise than at a hotel further away -- no big deal. The beds were the kind you get in the fanciest hotel, soft and comfortable. They were high, so a short person like myself almost needed a footstool to get in my bed. Once there, however, I could have stayed there all day and night. At night, it was a bit dark for a couple blocks until you reached the main street (Canal), so you might want to walk with someone else, if you don't like less well-lit areas. Construction nearby may have contributed to this being darker than normal. Once the construction is completed there may be more light from the adjacent lot. The wireless internet did not always work for me, but it was nice it was free when it did work. We were all pleased with the rate -- less than $100 a night, including all taxes and fees for executive rooms (albeit without microwave or refrigerator). Next time our convention is in New Orleans, we will definitely check out availability from this hotel. I have a feeling, that as word spreads, availability may go down, but that happens with decent accommodations.", "Date": "March 11, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Kansas City, Missouri", "Title": "\u201cThis Hotel Saved us!!\u201d", "Author": "thepen-1", "ReviewID": "UR25208928", "Content": "A Trip to New Orleans for Mardi Gras landed us in a horrible hotel.(Read review on Canal Street Hotel) The next morning, my friend started making phone calls to area hotels hoping to find a vacancy.

I chose the hotel for its price and for its proximity to Bourbon St. I had a number of conversations with the staff prior to my arrival as I was managing reservations for a multiple rooms and there were a number of modifications that I needed to make to the reservations as well as confirmations to be managed. Both before my stay and during, the hotel staff was patient, responsive, and courteous even in spite of an incident that occurred when one of my crew partied a little too hard. As for the hotel, itself, it's going through renovations and the block that it is on is kinda...blah. With that said, while the look and the feel of the lobby is merely perfunctory, the rooms appear to have completed their renovations and I was pleased with their quality (i.e, soft bed, flat-screen tv, nice bathroom). I suspect that I got a deal on the room because of the renovations, but it was well worth the price. The hotel, itself, is one block away from Canal St. and the French Quarter and two blocks from the corner of Canal and Bourbon. It's a great location if you want to be close to the main N.O. nightlife and still save a bit of cash. One thing to be on the look out for: the internal rooms have windows that open to the interior of the hotel, itself, which I'm sure some would think is a privacy issue in spite of the fact that they have curtains. You'll want to request a room that opens to the exterior of the hotel. Aside from that, make no mistake that during Mardi Gras, you're going to have a party crowd at this hotel. They'll be up late, and while the noise level was not a problem for me, there are people coming and going (and making some noise) in the middle of the night during Mardi Gras.

It is right off Canal Street, so almost everything is within walking distance. I did have two complaints: (1) The parking. It is $20 per night valet service. If you need to get in and out, you have to stop by the front desk so they can walk outside and push a remote to let the bar up so you can enter and exit. The ramp which leads under the building to the parking garage is very steep. However, if you intend to park and stay there until you leave, it is not that big of a deal. (2) We got the less expensive of the rooms, and these rooms do not include a mini-fridge and microwave.

Meaning you won't find designer towels and toiletries or a 4 star restaurnt. But it is a very clean, modern hotel, in a great location, at a great price! I've stayed at plenty of hotels in NOLA in this class/price range and I think Baronne Plaza is one of the best. Some comparable hotels, all of which I also recommend, are: The Ambassador, Queen & Crescent, Hotel St Marie, and Prince Conti. My stay at Baronne Plaza was as good or better than those. The price during Mardi Gras was only $139 a night, which is pretty much impossible to come by. I actually still think that there must have been some mistake with the price because it was so cheap considering it was Mardi Gras. The rooms are large and clean and it wasn't loud in there despite it being Mardi Gras. The layout of the place was a bit odd, so be prepared that some rooms don't have windows, That was fine with me because I am a light sleeper, and it was so dark in there that I got some really good sleep. The bathroom was nice, had great water pressure. Huge TV with cable. It was more than adequate, it was nice. The staff was very friendly as well. The security was a bit lacking, they had a system of handing out wristbands to guests to avoid problems with drunken revelers wandering around in there, but they never checked the wristbands. They did however reprgram my keys when I lost one of them. The best thing about the Baronne Plaza, which is a big part of the value, is the location It's on the edge of the French Quarter so it's the best of both worlds: acess to the quarter without actually having to be IN the quarter. And, it's not a sketchy walk back late at night by yourself (not true of say, Amerisuites on Canal; a few blocks can make a huge difference in NOLA in terms of quality of neighborhood.) Anyway, I can't find a single complaint about my stay there, and I'm quite pleased with my discovery.

The inside of the hotel is really nice in art deco style and the staff is really nice and helpful. Most of the room have windows on the hotel lobby which has double advantages: no noise from the street where jazz bands play at any time of the day or night; and no light in the morning which is great when you had a late night on Bourbon street and need some sleep in the morning. Only problems: you discover the weather only when getting out of the hotel, and the parking at $20 a night a bit expensive. Otherwise I would recommend the hotel to everyone.

Sure, a lot of the rooms don't have outside windows, but that was a bonus for us - kept out the street noise and the light in the mornings! Not that there was any street noise - it's just far away enough from Bourbon St to be nice and quiet, but close enought to be convenient. And as someone else pointed out, the 24hr Walgreens a block away is a definite bonus. No complaints at all about cleanliness or housekeeping - our room was cleaned every day, and when the flush lever on our toilet broke, it was fixed within an hour of us telling them. Architecturally, I loved it! The restaurant attached is great, more than just a cafe. And the desk staff we dealt with were all absolutely lovely (especially Kathleen), and did everything they could to help, booking tours for us and calling to sort out a problem we had with the airport shuttle at 4 a.m.!

I stayed there for Mardi Gras in 2004. I have stayed in approximately 10 different New Orleans hotels on my visits to the Big Easy. This is the worst - by far. I understand that most hotels use wristbands during Mardi Gras, and I have never had a problem with this. When we checked in on Thursday, the wristbands were not ready, we were told to come back later. I went and obtained mine the next day, but the front desk staff would not let me get the ones for my 3 friends that were listed guests in the room as they had to get them for themselves. * When my friends tried to get them later, they were told that the replacement fee was $50 per wristband, even though they had never picked up the original. The desk personnel threatened to call the cops if we tried to enter our hotel without the wristbands. Luckily they were horribly understaffed and had no way of preventing access to the hotel. The valet was also horrible, it took 40 minutes to retrieve my vehicle on Friday morning. * In summary, stay at the Alexa or Marriott, they are both great. * If you are looking for low prices for a room, you are better off to take a cab to Metarie or sleep on the street.
