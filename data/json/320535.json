{"Reviews": [{"Content": "Decent hotel in quiet part of Tokyo We stayed at the Akasaka Yoko Hotel for 3 nights in May 2008. The hotel is located in a residential area of Tokyo, Akasaka, near many embassies. The price was reasonable for Tokyo (~USD150/night), but you get what you pay for. Rooms were very small, with just enough room for the beds and our suitcases. But at that price I wouldn't expect much more. Like every place we stayed at in Japan, the rooms are very clean even at the budget price level. We picked this hotel for its location near both subway stops, and Roppongi area.Some other notes about our stay:- Convenient computers to connect to the internet were located in the lobby (JPY100/10 mins)- Front desk spoke minimal English- You will be given a receipt upon check in, which you need to keep with you when you leave the hotel. The hotel requests that you leave your key with the front desk, so you need the receipt to get your key back- The airport limo bus does not stop at the hotel. The closest stop is the Ritz Carlton which is a 10 minute walk to the Yoko.Overall we enjoyed our stay here, but for the price there are other hotels in Tokyo that I would recommend (see my other reviews).", "Date": "May 27, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR344914554", "Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Business service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "3", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "BIY808"}, {"Content": "Decent for the price Stayed in the Akasaka Yoko Hotel for 5 nights in early December '07. In a good location, only 5mins walk from Akasaka subway station. Rooms very small but was expected for Japan and internet in the room which was very handy. I wasnt impressd with breakfast, cold broccoli and beans were regular, also the bread was pre-toasted so no chance of getting fresh bread or even warm toast. Free water bottles suplied in the afternoon, but only in the afternoon.Dont bother trying to ask for one in the morning. Also no adaptors for the powerpoints if you have appliances from other countries. Apart from breakfast the price was reasonable for what we got. May choose another hotel next time.I would say the hotel was pretty average but location was handy.", "Date": "Jan 17, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR834703245", "Ratings": {"Service": "-1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "-1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "3", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "-1", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "ray138"}, {"Content": "Affordable and decent hotel in center of Tokyo This is a budget hotel in Tokyo -- but in a great neighborhood. It is easy to find from Narita and just a few blocks from the Akasaka metro stop. The room is SMALL, but not much worse than other budget hotels in Japan. And for the price (I paid US$62 including breakfast through asiarooms.com), you can't beat it. Don't expect luxury. But, you can expect a very clean hotel with helpful staff (English skills were fine) and a good location. This hotel is a great place to stay in Tokyo if you don't want to break the bank.", "Date": "Jun 5, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR466608730", "Ratings": {"Service": "-1", "Business service": "3", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "3", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "Pasha2"}, {"Content": "Decent accom- friendly staff Small rooms, but the staff were more than helpful and spoke basic English.Were worried about getting there from Narita, but as the Hotel is close to the Akasaka train line it wasnt too hard.Nice breakfast which was a combination of Japanese and Western food- overall expensive but decent and safe* Even had free bottle of water per day to help fight the humidity!", "Date": "Nov 29, 2006", "ReviewID": "UR321440620", "Ratings": {"Service": "-1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "-1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "4", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "-1", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "TwoAust_Travelers"}, {"Content": "Small, clean and great value base for Tokyo travelling Stayed at the Akasaka Yoko Hotel for 3 nights from 22/9/06 as part of a week of travelling in Japan. The first 2 nights my wife and I stayed with my brother who lives in Japan in a 3-bed room. The last night we stayed in a double bedroom on our own.Firstly, the hotel is situated in clean area with a mix of commerical, retail and restaurants with a subway entrance within 2 blocks (Central Tokyo, Ginza, Shibuya, Shinjuku and Harajuku were all within a few stops) It was always nice to come back to a nice street without the craziness of some of the areas we'd spent all day and night in. Even my brother who's lived in Japan for 1 1/2 years said that we'd picked a good area. The hotel itself doesn't grab you from the outside but the small foyer was always immaculate with helpful desk staff (they spoke enough English to get by, just like our Japanese!) and free bottled water to guests which was a nice touch. There was internet available in the foyer and washing machines/dryers on the second floor.We got free breakfast with our room which is in the attached restaurant. It was a small smorgasbord with a mix of Japanese (ie salmon, noodles, etc) and English (bread, jam, croissants, etc). The coffee and tea were good and endless. It was always a good way to start the day without running around on the street looking for food or paying hollywood dollars at a hotel.As I said, the breakfast was included in the room price. We booked online and for the 2 nights in the 3 bed room paid $197 Australian a night, that's only $66 per person with breakfast! The last night was $140 Aus for the double room. Again, excellent value for Tokyo or any large city.The 3 bed room was laughably small but incredibly clean. It amazed us how everything fit in the room. The bathroom was 1m sq with a shower, basin and toilet/bidet. Again, this was always very clean. The 2 bed room was slightly bigger and was just as clean. Remember this is Tokyo! We paid less for this hotel than we did in New York, San Fran, Vegas and LA with breakfast included, who cares how big the room is! They were always perfectly clean, so dump your bags and get out into it!In short, all of us would stay here again. It was a great location, incredibly clean and well priced. Highly recommended.", "Date": "Oct 14, 2006", "ReviewID": "UR127065184", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "5", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "GuySouthern"}], "HotelInfo": {"HotelURL": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1066451-d320535-r16442573-Akasaka_Yoko_Hotel-Minato_Tokyo_Tokyo_Prefecture_Kanto.html", "HotelID": "320535", "Price": "$110"}}
