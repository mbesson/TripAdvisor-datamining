The staff were very pleasant and let me check in very early, but the room was grubby. It was an unrefurbished room, but that didn't mean that it had to be so unloved. I ended up telling my daughter not to touch the curtains, because every time they were moved, billows of old dust erupted from them. A hostess bar for decrepit Chinese gentleman tourists was off the main lobby. I didn't take the breakfast. Newton Hawker market is 5 minutes walk away, and open for breakfast. I did try the Bakuteh pork soup lunch set at the restaurant one day and it was fantastic. The pool was the high point of the stay. Spacious, clean, swimming with the stars above, and the sound of the traffic below was a nice way to finish up the day. A real mixed bag this hotel.

Housekeeping was the worst - they couldn't even make the beds properly! We had to complain that they hadn't even swept the bathroom floor, and even after complaining they didn't do it! We also asked them to change the chairs in our room so that we could have a place to sit apart from the bed (!!) and they didn't do that either. Breakfast was extremely average - the breakfast area is very small and with so many guests, it takes forever to get your food! Most of the food was cold and there were ants in the danish pastries!! The *only* good thing about this hotel is it's location - it's about a 7-10 minute walk to the Novena MRT and there is a bus stop right outside the hotel, and it's also close by to some malls.

Friendly and helpful staff advised me it would be ready for 12. I returned after an enjoyable breakfast and walk in the surrounding area at 11 a.m. My room was ready!!! *Baggage can be left securely at reception with attentive staff. *I found all relevant staff friendly, efficient and helpful. *In-house Trishaw Coffee house great for breakfast. Let the staff know if you are self-serve or table service. I had table service because I wanted to try the Nasi Goreng (a rice dish).The meal and 2 coffees cost less than S$20. *My room, 823, is accessible by an efficient 3 lifts system. The room was certainly spacious and comfortable. If you like exercise, jog around the bed a few times!!! Furniture and fittings are suitable, with a few \"tatty edges\" which in some ways can add to the experience rather than detract. *Importantly, the room was clean. *I don't watch TV on holiday, but there is a large screen TV in the room. *Bathroom is clean and suitable. The shower 'blasts' so is very invigourating. *AirCon is comfortable unless you prefer the \"arctic blasts\" sometimes provided in Florida hotels. *There is a safe, minifridge, hairdrier and spacious wardrobe but little drawer space and no iron. *Big bonus for Brits - same electrical provision as home - no adapters needed. For other travellers, take a British adapter. *Tipping isn't a big deal, yet, but is becoming more evident and is appreciated rather than expected. *For a first night experience, and if you like walking, Stroll down Newton Road and Scotts Road soaking up the atmosphere until you hit Orchard Road. Be prepared to be hit by an eclectic mix of Upmarket right through to the other extreme. I did this at 8p.m. on a Tuesday, so it is safe walking at night and people were very friendly in the hustle and bustle of Orchard Street. At night it reminded me of a cross between London's Oxford St./ Piccadilly and Times Square. I ate at a Chinese pavement eatery on Bras Basah Road and strolled back to DHOBY GHOUT SRT station at 10,30 p.m. where easy and efficient underground travel took me from D.G. (which is NS24 on the red north/south line) north towards JURONG EAST and 3 stops to NEWTON (NS21). Cost S$2. 10. A 5 minute stroll and you're back at the hotel. *Singapore is dominantly English speaking with a great mix of Western and Asian cultures. *Exchange a S$10 note for some loose change at reception on arrival, certainly if you intend to use any public transport. Always try to keep some loose change at all times. *Singapore has a great public transport system with a bus stop immediately outside the hotel and the underground station only a 5 minute walk away. *People pride themselves on personal and environmental cleanliness. *Go to Marina Bay before dusk and stroll around the footpath (3.5 km) as dusk turns to darkness. There is a lights/lasers/music/water feature display from Marina Bay Sand which has a great view from the Fullerton side. Your camera finger will be burning!! *If you intend to take the cable car to Sentosa ( I would recommend it), it is S$26 return from Tower 1 outside HARBOUR FRONT (SRT) exit.

Make sure you bring some bottled water in your luggage since mineral water is expensive in Singapore. 4) Food - pricey so we didn't eat there.

Black stains along the bath tub and after every shower, no matter how careful you are, we ended up with a big puddle of water in the middle of the bathroom floor.

Perhaps it is more to aimed at Asian tastes - we tended to stick to toast and jam and even then, the bread was below par. The rooms are good size but our two rooms were in need of a make over.

The room was of a good size, although this was a travel agent upgrade so I cannot speak for the standard rooms. The furniture was \"tired\" and the shower little short of pathetic.

However on the first morning the toaster went up in blue flash, blowing the electrics. There was a great deal of staff running around like headless chickens and eventually the toaster being removed but not replaced. All good cabaret but not satisfactory if you like toast for breakfast.

As it happens the taxi turned out to be a cheaper alternative and also quicker. So a tip here is use a taxi not the shuttle.

We arrived at 6am and were offered a non-smoking room (as requested) room straight away, but we decided to wait till 9.30 for a double bed, rather than accepting the twin single. Service throughout our stay was fine and housekeeping were all friendly and happy to help with extra towels when asked. The rooms were a good size and although the furniture was old, the tv had 30 odds channels, although not all of them had a signal and the bath was so high that it was sometimes a struggle to climb out of the tub after a shower. There was no bedside clock, and the air-conditioning seemed fine and kept the room cool. Our rooms did not have an ironing board or an iron, but there was one located in the laundry. The bathroom smelled very musty and there were mould spots on the shower curtain, and there was always water in the grout from when housekeeping would clean the place. Our basin was also cracked, which led to very small amounts of water dripping onto the tiles below. The bed wasn't exactly the most comfortable and the sheets were a little scratchy for my liking, but all that was acceptable to us because we knew that we were not staying at a 5 star hotel. There is a laundry on the 4th floor, along with a couple of coin operated computers ($2 for 15 minutes). It's not exactly fast and there were issues of the slots swallowing your money and not giving you your time, so use them at your own peril. There was no music or noise issues, except for noisy guests returning late at night and slamming the door shut, or talking loudly as they go past your room. We were on the 9th floor and only 2 doors from the elevator and the only time we heard music coming from either the club upstairs or the karaoke lounge downstairs (not sure which one) was the morning we checked in (about 10am) when we were trying to get some sleep after a red eye flight. We used the tour booking office to book a tour to Malacca and although we got what we needed, the tour operator always seemed very busy and did not go into detail much unless he was asked direct questions. What was a nice touch from the hotel was after staying a week, we were left a small fruit platter and after staying about 2 weeks, some of our party were given a small gift of biscuits. Those of us that did not get our rooms cleaned on that day didn't get anything. The hotel is located only a 8 minute casual walk from the MRT station, but there is also a bus stop located right outside the hotel (which we used frequently) that can take you to Orchard Road and right around the island. Plenty of taxis go past the hotel because it is located on busy Newton road. There are three shopping centres at the MRT station and plenty of eateries (including Starbucks) where you can get your meals rather than eating at the hotel. Walking in the other direction for 10 minutes will take you to Newton Circus, where you can get yourself dinner or a late night supper. The only big negatives seem to happen to the others that were travelling in our party. My sister had someone come into her room late one night because the staff had accidentally given him 'her' room, instead on the room two floors above. Fortunately were all were gathered in my sister's room at that moment for a late night drink and chat, so the look on that poor traveller's face when he opened the door and found us all sitting there was priceless. From a security point of view, it's not a laughing matter though. My parents stayed in a room diagonals from us and they had problems of water leaking on their backs whilst there were using the toilet. The problem was fixed that day, but it's still a gross thought and would have been a distraction no doubt when you're supposed to be sitting on the toilet focusing on something more important. My brother and his girlfriend's room was across from us and they returned to their room one night to find a huge (I know we all tend to exaggerate, but this one was huge) spider in the corner of their roof. Someone came to try and remove it unsuccessfully, so my brother and his girlfriend decided to squash it against the roof (using the tools from the maintenance guy), killing it and leaving a nice smear mark for the rest of their stay. The last of our party arrived a week after we did, and although he wasn't able to get a non-smoking room (on our floor), his smoking room did not have any overpowering smell of cigarettes, so after unsuccessfully trying to get a room on our floor after 2 nights, he decided to stay put for the rest of his stay. Paying what we paid, you can probably get a better hotel in a slightly better location, but at the time of our booking, it was a cheap hotel (we were staying nearly 3 weeks). Would I stay there again?

This was very much welcomed as we flew the Red-Eye specials overnight to arrive in Spore in the early morning, and were already weary. The staff was also accommodating enough to move us to a quieter & less smokey room in the afternoon when it was available. Only issue with the location is that you need to take a bus from the hotel to go anywhere of interest, or walk 10min to the nearest MRT train station. We were warned by the staff to stay aware from the KTV lounge on the ground floor after dark if you are not into the seedy scene. The room & facilities, while old, were still clean enough. I guess they must have renovated & improved on the conditions since the previous bad reviews. The hotel is still undergoing renovations so noise could be a slight issue. The buffet breakfast, when included, consists of hot & cold food, and looks quite plentiful. We however did not take up that option. There was no complimentary morning newspaper or any stationery (papers, pens, envelope etc) in the room, but the standard tea & coffee-making amenities, including bar fridge are provided.
