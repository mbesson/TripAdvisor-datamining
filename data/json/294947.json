This review is for the hotel services and breakfast, the second review is on the Stablesgate page and is about the rooms and property. The location is walking distance from the old town and Blue Mosque, and only a couple blocks from the Topkapi gate,\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6but with that said, the Armada is slightly further away from the touristy sites than most other hotels. The Armada is a larger older hotel just behind the old city wall on the seacoast. The building itself doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t look like much from the outside, but it is nicely decorated inside, and very well kept. The lobby is full of history and memorabilia to show the pedigree of the place. The lobby, bar, and house are all slightly nostalgic to an earlier Istanbul \u00e2\u20ac\u201c which fits with the old cars and the old bus that the hotel has (available for hire) for touring customers around. Breakfast is served on the roof terrace which is a glasshouse popping out of the roof of the hotel, looking in one direction onto the Marmara sea and over to Asia; and in the other direction up to the Aya Sofia, the Blue Mosque and the surrounding historic quartier. There is also a open terrace for when the weather is warmer and sunny. Between the views, the birds and the rooftop action there is always something to look at. However this is only a minor distraction from the breakfast buffet! The food is excellent, opulent, plentiful, and is a mix of Turkish and western breakfast foods: Cheese, olives, dried fruit, and boerek - or if you prefer, muesli, toast, jams, and omelette. The self-pressed fresh orange juice was fantastic! The staff, \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6both the wait-service staff and the hotel desk staff were also extremely helpful, professional, and friendly. They offered us umbrellas when they knew the weather would turn in the afternoon, and gave good advice for finding obscure shops and galleries. All in all we were very pleased with the Armada, and can highly recommend it.", "Date": "April 15, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Istanbul", "Title": "\u201cThis hotel is a gem!\u201d", "Author": "Anne P", "ReviewID": "UR127866504", "Content": "The room and terrace restaurant have a fabulous view of the blue mosque and hagia Sophia.

It's not actually that close to the airport mileage-wise, but since it is just off a main highway, the airport is quickly reached by car. We were arriving on international flights and staying for just one night in Istanbul before taking off early in the morning for our tour of Turkey. Our room was fine; we did not have a view, but the bed was comfortable, the bathroom fine; there was a little street noise, but it didn't bother us. The room was supposedly non-smoking, but smelled a little when we arrived. We opened the window to air it out, and it was fine after that. The roof-top terrace looking out at the Blue Mosque on one side and the Marmara Sea on the other is beautiful; however, it was too cold for us to eat there. Our dinner inside at the restaurant was fine, albeit a bit pricey. However, it was nice to be able to eat in the hotel after our long flights, and the restaurant food was good and service quite attentive. Breakfast was the typical Turkish buffet with cereals, fruits, yogurt, salad stuff, breads, omelette, and delicious, freshly squeezed orange juice.

The food at the restaurant was better at breakfast than at dinner, in fact the morning buffet is outstanding featuring plates of fruit, cheeses, granola, fresh pastries, various egg dishes, copious amounts of fresh coffee, all restocked by an observant wait staff.

We stayed in Studio 2 and we found it simply amazing and very close to the hotel proper, with its reception and breakfast. The furniture is in perfect Turkish style, with carpets, curtains, and Ottoman window where the bed is located. Books on Turkey, Istanbul, and newspapers/magazines on what's going on in the city are offered for your consultation on the desk. Plus, soft bathrobes are available in every room. The studios, as the rooms, are cleaned everyday. The breakfast (and restaurant) is a major highlight of this hotel. Perfectly included in your room price, it involves a long (LONG) table full of every sort of Turkish delicacy, including tea, fresh orange juice, pomegranate juice, hot and cold plates typical of the local cuisine, fruit salads, cheeses, honey in the honeycomb, and even local dried fruits. In the summer it takes place in the breathtaking terrace with view of the Blue Mosque and Haghia Sophia, where enchanting calls to prayers can be heard. During the winter and spring, the beautiful restaurant room on the roof, with large windows, offer comfort, warmth, and, besides the Blue Mosque, even a nice view of the seaside.

So many hotels nowadays could be anywhere, but the Armada is clearly an Istanbul institution: the furniture, the paintings on the walls, the carpets, even the wood used and the olive soap provided, not to mention the amazing breakfast buffet, could not be anywhere but in this city. The staff at this hotel were really outstanding in every respect: friendly, attentive, and provided everything we needed, when we needed it, and with a warm smile. The food at the hotel was also excellent. The breakfast buffet was truly amazing (about 50 different items available, until 10:30 a.m. every morning), but dinner in the top restaurant was excellent as well. And having been to some of the other high end restaurants in Istanbul during our stay, I can say that the Armada's food was both excellent value for money and amongst the best meals I had there. Again, the service was superb. The room we had was one of the hotel's top end rooms, and we felt it was worth every penny. Spatious, beautiful, great view of the Bosphorous, a huge bathroom with excellent shower, and a bowl of free fruit left for us every day.

Tips about Istambul: If you want to visit the basilica\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s cistern go there as 9 am (when itopens), otherwise it will be queues to get inside. Visit also the Sultan\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s mausoleums between Aya Sofia and Topkapi Palace (free entrance). Go to the Spice Bazaar and walk to the Grand Bazaar. All area it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a street market where you can buy the same things you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll find in the grand bazaar for less money. If you want to take a boat cruise in the Bosforo you have two options: With IDO (boat company) takes around 6 hours. Take the boat in Eminonu Harbour (You\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be in Anadolu Kavagi \u00e2\u20ac\u201c near Black Sea for 3 hours before taking the boat back); With TurYol, take the ferry in Eminonu (after Galata Bridge).It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a 1h30 boat trip with no stops for 10TL (5\u00e2\u201a\u00ac).This one only takes you to Ataturk Bridge and back. The Ataturk Airport has a tight security (you have a police control at the entrance before check in) and the usual one before the gates.

I fell in love with the house online when I ran a search for places to stay in the historic district. No matter what other properties I looked at, this one kept calling my name. The pictures of the views from the terrace were so enticing! My brother and his partner arrived on 01 November around 15:30 and checked in before I did. I landed about 90 minutes after they did and, subsequently, checked in that much later. When getting to the house, I felt like I was on the \"Real World \u00c4\u00b0stanbul\" ... running to get there first to pick the best room. Now, the house is on a little side-street away from the hotel. As one in our party put it, \"it's the corner of Down-And-Out and Up-And-Coming.\" But, you ARE living on a street with people and families who have lived there for a long time. You are communing with the local population. That was a definite plus in our book. The house is akin to a row house in NYC. It is very narrow (width-wise), but it is tall. It has five levels. Street level is the living room with the TV and a full bathroom with shower. The lower level is where the kitchen, dining table and washer/dryer are located. The first level up is a mater bedroom with full-/queen-sized bed and en-suite bathroom. The second level is identical to the first (except the d\u00c3\u00a9cor is a bit different). And finally, the last level is that of the terrace: broken down into a glassed-in terrace and an outdoor terrace. The terrace alone is worth the price of admission. I kid you not. You have a stunning view of the Sea of Marmara, the Golden Horn (and Beyo\u00c4\u0178lu) and less than 500 m. from you ... the Sultan Ahmet Camii (The Blue Mosque) and the Aya Sofya (Hagia Sophia). As mentioned previously, the house is on a narrow side-street a few minutes' walk from the entrance to the Hotel. If there was an entrance in the rear of the Hotel, you'd be inside the Hotel in a matter of seconds. Unfortunately, this is not the case, and you have to circle the hotel ... often finding yourself trying to not get run over by the traffic that circulates on Ah\u00c4\u00b1rkap\u00c4\u00b1 Sokak. The breakfasts at the Hotel's Teras (Terrace) were divine. No cold cuts, but almost everything else under the sun. The one complaint ... the bees. There are bees everywhere. And, one of the mornings we were there, one of us in the party saw a bee sting one of the other patrons. Not sure how often this happens, but I'm sure more than not. So, if you are allergic to bee stings ... be careful. The staff at Teras was magnificent; very friendly, very warm, very quick to get what you needed. The staff at the hotel, however ... The hotel staff (front desk and bellboys) was another matter altogether. They were never rude ... but they were never friendly, either. They were cold, aloof, and seemed put-off a lot of the times. Maybe it had something to do with that most of the staff's English abilities were limited (or they made it seem that way so as to not be bothered). Now, don't get me wrong ... English is not the only language any one of us speaks (some of us speak English, Spanish, French and Italian), but when working in a tourist-destination hotel, one should ensure that the staff is more than just \"basic knowledge\" English. The one exception was the Concierge -- he was always very willing to help us, was always very helpful when giving information, spoke English beautifully and had a friendly demeanor. Housekeeping did a magnificent job of maintaining the room clean. No complaints there. MAJOR COMPLAINTS: 1. The full-sized sofa bed and sofas that convert to twin-sized beds are the WORST ever. The sofa bed is about as comfortable as sleeping on jagged rocks. The other sofas are minimally better than that. If the House Annex is being sold as a space where SIX people can sleep comfortably, then they should make sure that the beds on the living room floor are comfortable. 2. The hotel has WiFi throughout the lobby, the Teras and, I'm sure, in the rooms. The hotel, however, DOES NOT have WiFi in the House Annex ... something we all found very annoying. Every time we wanted to keep in touch or see what was going on in the world, we'd have to get up and go to the Hotel. 3. On our last night, the fire brigade came and shut off the power to our street because there was a threat of a fire. Understandable in such an old neighborhood. The hotel had a generator that kept them up-and-running. The house annex didn't even have working emergency lights. When I called the front desk to find out what was going on, they were less than helpful and seemed like they couldn't care less. All in all, the place is magnificent. I would go back to \u00c4\u00b0stanbul in a second ... would have to think about going back to the Armada Hotel (would not have to think about going back to the House Annex if there was WiFi).", "Date": "November 18, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "London", "Title": "\u201cFunctional and clean\u201d", "Author": "Elsailor", "ReviewID": "UR87049765", "Content": "Nice hotel, good rooms with plenty of room. location is ok, you need to walk a little to get to the main attractions.

While the hotel is not bad, it is not as nice as many reviewers have made it out to be. Yes, the hotel is located in Sultanahment, but you to walk up a very steep hill. The 15 minute walk up a hill with no sidewalks (there was also lots of construction in the area) in 100 degree heat made it difficult and unpleasant. Yes, the hotel is located in Sultanahmet, but it does not mean that everything will be at your door step. Sultanahmet are is large. It's also 15-20 walk to the tram stop which made it inconvenient to come back to the hotel in the afternoon if wanted to change before dinner. The room was very small. Once we put our suitcases on the floor, there was no space left to walk. And we paid for a superior room. We asked a king bed but instead got two twins. When we complained, they pushed the two beds together and put an extra matress cover to make the beds stay together. The sea view wasn't that great either. There was a break in between two buldings so you could see a bit of the sea but not what we imagined. It was not worth the extra cash to pay for the sea view. The front desk were not very enthusiastic when I asked questions on several occasions. I asked them about a tour to Gallipoli and they picked the most expensive travel agency which we declined. The hotel does have a very nice roof top but so do many other hotels. You could always come for drinks and stay somewhere else. The breakfast buffet was nice but there was no meat served in the 9 days we were these. I like fresh fruit for breakfast but it would have been nice to have some meat too. You should avoid the hotel restaurant for dinner. The prices are outrageous. If we come back to Istanbul again, we will stay around Istiklal street. Istiklal has much better restaurant selection and the locals are less aggressive. The biggest drawback to staying in Sultanahmet are the agressive locals who are constantly trying to sell you things. It is impossible to walk two steps without some local asking you to buy something and buy it an extremely inflated price.

For this hotel - I noticed that it had gotten some really amazing reviews yet was also really, really wallet-friendly. (I paid about $100 USD per night back in December which is considered peak travel time for Istanbul.) THIS HOTEL LIVED UP TO THE HYPE EVERY BIT! I have to say - after coming home - I still dream about the breakfasts that were served, I dream about how neat, tidy and clean our room was as well as how lovely the view was on the roof garden! I absolutely LOVED this hotel and hope you'll stay there because it really is one of the best deals and one of the best spots in town to stay! The hotel is centrally located in Sultahnahmet which is a popular area of Istanbul for hotels. You'll notice - if you walk the streets - that there are tons of tour offices, inns, hotels, souvenir shops, cafes, etc in the area and it's really great if you're a tourist. The hotel is about a 10 minute walk from the Hagya Sofya and Blue Mosque. Everyone in these reviews talks about the \"uphill\" walk but really it's not that bad. There is about one particularly steep hill when you're walking to the sightseeing destinations- but the rest aren't too bad. Once you're near the Hagya Sofya/Blue Mosque there is easy access to the trams, buses, etc. that run throughout the city and allow you to get to various areas. We found the bus system/tram system really easy to figure out and even made it to Asia one afternoon (if you go there try Ciya - the food is amazing)! The hotel rooms are small-ish but definitely not cramped. I mean it's Istanbul not Milwaukee! There is enough space and the bathrooms were both absolutely clean, modern and a good-size with a very good shower. There is also a safe in room along with a heating/AC. We stayed when it was Winter so we kept the heat on - but there is an absolutely lovely window to open as well as AC if you're traveling during other times of year. The lobby is great - complete with a little pool filled with turtles as well as various birds in birdcages. There is a cafe there where they serve coffee as well as an internet room where people can purchase time. The internet cafes are cheaper but if you just want to get onto cheap email it's definitely convenient to have there. There are also several elevators throughout the hotel and when I was there they were all working! The breakfasts are absolutely AMAZING! They are served on the hotel's roofdeck. It's a closed space but there is an open space parallel to it where you can sit outside when it's nice out. The views are spectacular. On one side you see the ocean and on the other side - there's a gorgeous view of the Sofya church as well as the Mosque. Definitely an exciting spot to eat breakfast. As for the food - it's absolutely incredible! The coffee is great, the eggs are delicious and there are tons of other treats like dolmatas (grape leaves), turkish delight, toast, yogurts, toppings and even honeycomb!!! The food was really spectacular as was the view so there is nothing to be missed there! The staff is great -- the guy that we worked with who is the concierge is awesome! Mr. Mazliyah. He's really helpful with bits of info. My brother - who I was staying with and who had been roadtripping in Europe - needed a laundry spot. So he gave us great directions and was super helpful in suggesting ways for us to get to Asia for the day. He was super helpful. There is also a restaurant on the top floor of the hotel (where bfast is served) and it serves delicious, modern Turkish cuisine. This hotel allowed me an amazing stay! The rooms were great - clean, comfy and modern; the food was delicious and the location was prime.

We arrived at about 10am, obviously too early to check in, but the Armada had our room ready in about five minutes. As we had been on the overnight train from Thessaloniki (not comfortable, NOT the Orient Express of yesteryear), getting us straight to our room was much appreciated. Our room looked over the old city wall towards the waterway, providing beautiful maritime views. The room was spotless. Although so many people smoke in this part of the world, the hotel had the good sense to segregate the non-smoking rooms in one area, and it seemed as though the HVAC system also had a filter. Moreover, when we went to breakfast in the morning, we saw that the housekeeping staff is equipped with HEPA filters they carry around and set in the hallway when they are cleaning rooms. This was an amazing effort, unseen in the other hotels on our trip. BTW, the housekeepers wore hospital scrubs, which was fitting given how clean they kept everything. The breakfast buffet was great -- every kind of local and regional food, from the regular (fresh farm cheeses and dried fruits) to the exotic (chunks of fresh honeycomb). We also had dinner in the restaurant -- the food was first class, the service was excellent, and the wine list featured Turkish (Anatolian) wines, organized and described in a clear manner. For a first class restaurant, the price was totally fair. The location is excellent -- just far enough from the Sultanhamet sites to keep you out of the tourist zone, but close enough to walk right out to them (Blue Mosque, Hagia Sophia, Topkapi Palace, etc.), even when it was raining. The only ding was that on Friday night there was a wedding in one of the many conference rooms, and so the booming music reverberated throughout the hotel. We telephoned the desk (as we had an early flight in the morning) and were informed the music would continue until at least midnight. This seemed a little late given the impact on the rest of the hotel, but the music actually died out a little earlier. In short, we thoroughly enjoyed this hotel, and at about 110 euros per night, including breakfast, found it to be an A++ value.

The response from the barman was \"not possible, football.\" When he then turned the volume up we got the message and left without finishing our coffee. The buffet breakfast was in the covered terrace restaurant but again the service was disappointing. Most tables weren't cleared or set up and none of the staff made any effort to greet you or show you a table. Orange or lemon squash were substituted for fruit juice unless one paid an extra 5 Turkish Lira for a glass of fresh orange! What is such a shame is that the hotel is a great location in the historic part of Istanbul with very comfortable rooms.

The breakfast buffet (included in the price of the room) was a great value. The dining area is on top of the hotel providing great views of Santa Sophia and the Blue Mosque. My one problem with the hotel is its location. It is not handy to public transportation and about the only way to get around is by tax. To be truthful the hotel is at the bottom of a very steep hill on top of which are the aforesaid Santa Sophia and Blue Mosque.

These views are to be enjoyed both at breakfast, and as darkness falls.

Again, for 1.4 Turkish Lira you can go any distance on the tram! If you prefer taxis, they are easily available. The hotel staff collected us from the airport, and we arrived at the check-in desk to be given a very comfortable room with air conditioning and bath/shower room for 130 Euros per night bed and breakfast, including local tax. The view from our window was down into a street, but it wasn't noisy. The beds are firm - but if you prefer something softer, a phonecall brings an immediate response: the bed is remade instantly with a soft mattress topper, and is very comfortable. There is a plentiful, impressive buffet at breakfast, and the staff couldn't be more helpful with my personal dietary requirements, even when it required microwaving my own gluten- free dish every morning.
