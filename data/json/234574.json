It is also right across the street from a metro stop and about two blocks from the harbor. This makes it convenient to almost all the attractions in Barcelona. The hotel itself is clean and the staff are very friendly and speak excellent English. The rooms are small but contain a minibar and a safe. My window looked out over the old roman wall. My friend's room even had a computer for her use in the room. The hotel serves breakfast (at thirteen euros, kind of pricy) but other than that, does not have a restaurant. This is not a problem in Barcelona, where you can get great food everywhere. There is a bar if you want a quick cup of coffee or a nightcap. The front desk person also serves as the bartender. There is an Irish pub next door if you want to watch sports in a crowd or get tired of tapas and paella. The only drawback to our stay there was that they are working on the outside of the building and I was awakened by the work noise one morning. This is obviously only temporary and they did not start working until eight o'clock. I have stayed in other fancier hotels in Barcelona and this one was by far the most convenient and friendliest, not to mention easier on the pocketbook.", "Date": "April 24, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "1", "Sleep Quality": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "chesterfield", "Title": "\u201claietana barcelona unhappy\u201d", "Author": "stephen p Posted by an Easytobook.com traveler", "ReviewID": "UR128337265", "Content": "arrived in lobby to find fellow guest had been robbed in the lobby. first night slept in very small odd shaped double room - requested move on sight but no options available - view from window was scaffolding.

My only complaint is that the water pipes havent been insulated, something we take for granted in chilly England, the result being that everytime a toilet was flushed in the night you hear running water, which can wake you if you are a light sleeper, it was so bad that when I had a \"wee in the wee hours\" I thought that the toilet was stuck in flush mode. I got up to check and my disgruntled (tired) partner explined the issue and said that it had kept him awake. i dont know if this noice is in everyroom though.

There is a nice Irish Bar called Dunne, right next door where you can get an all day breakfast if you are a late riser, they also show football and are very friendly.

The hotel staff are friendly and welcoming on check-in, 2 of opur party of 6 had checked in a few days earlier and the front desk staff offered to change our pre-allocated rooms to the same floor. We decided to take 1 room on the same floor and 1 on the third floor... rooms 105, 305 and 107. Our room was 305 - the room was much better than we expected - the room was clean and not too small. The bathroom was also clean and of a decent size with a nice shower. On checking out the room plan on the fire escape details on the back of the door, it is clear that some of the hotel rooms are quite small. Rooms x04,x05,x07 are some of the smaller rooms. With x05,x06 are larger guest rooms, I would reccomend x06 as this is a corner room with 2 windows and appears to be one of the largest rooms on the plan. On the downside the beds were quite hard and there was a fair bit of street noise - but we spent little time in the rooms as there is so much to see!! There is a tube station very close to the hotel. The hotel is very close to Las Ramblas and in the Gothic quarter with lots of great tapas restaurants - would reccomend Taller de Tappas - very close to the hotel with a great variety of tapas dishes in a small square with street entertainers.

This hotel is what I'd call \"American style\", with a bright and open lobby and front desk that is always staffed with friendly and helpful, English-speaking hotel employees. I noticed there is a bar in the lobby with alcohol behind it, but never saw anyone drinking there. Our room was small but very nice and comfortable, overlooking the ancient ruins behind the hotel, which was cool. There was a minibar too, essential in my mind for keeping bottled water and yogurt for easy snacks in the room. You can see from my other reviews that I travel with a computer and wi-fi is very important to me. This hotel gets 5 stars in that department. Free wi-fi with a very strong signal in our room, 24/7. We were able to download full movies from iTunes for watching during siesta in less than 45 minutes. It was just as fast as the Verizon FiOS I have at home. The hotel location couldn't be beat. The Via Laietana runs between El Born and Bario Gottic - the 2 neighborhoods where we wanted to spend most of our time anyway.

I can honestly say that we never once heard the noise from the underground metro that everyone has been mentioning, however we did stay on the fifth floor so were probably quite lucky in that respect. Overall we were happy with our stay and never felt the need to complain about anything (although if i was to be really picky then the T.V could have done with a few more english channels!) We loved Barcelona, such a great city, and i would recommend this hotel for it's central location.", "Date": "August 28, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "1.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Netherlands", "Title": "\u201cIn the closet\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR5041861", "Content": "So, Laietana Palace Hotel it was. 200 euro\u2019s a night. This had better be good. A hint of what was coming came with the nondescript faces of the front desk. The elevator did not level so I tripped while stepping in. The hall was poorly lit, most certainly half the lumen that were used when the marketing pics were taken. The coloring reminded me of soviet style choices. The ever present Mediterranean watercolor paintings could not conceal the dead artist who decorated this. Before the lift started we felt a rumbling. The metro. Wow, every 3 minutes! from 5 am to 2 pm. Room 403. Door open and...... a bed! A soft \u2018tabletop\u2019 with again a nondescript flat grayish spread. I didn\u2019t measure it. (hey, how low can you go?) It just fitted the room or should I say 'closet'! Around the bed on 2 of the 4 sides was max 2 foot! space and the feet end had some more but then again it had to hold a minibar, chair, table with TV, internet hub, menu and a comments voucher, all nicely stacked for \u2026\u2026..moving. All you need for a 4 star rating. The bathroom was fitted by the Blind Institute (only in remote India have I seen worse marble tiling, plumbing and carpentry) and most likely the last time they replaced the bathroom kit by was the time they built it. It was full of fungi. Tired of the trip, I took a shower. Alternatively it went from burning hot to freezing cold. Not once but always. Even at full flow! Fire regulations require a floor plan. On the door, I glanced at our room. Everything was there. The elevator, the hall and all the rooms including the beds. Aha! This was a single person bedroom converted into a double! So, this is a management decision and screaming at the front desk won\u2019t work. I just felt the middle finger of the hotel manager/owner in my face. When passing the elevator we also saw a floor plan and I just wondered why they left out the room details on that one. I now knew why. Too many grinning faces! So, there I was. My wife booked the trip and I really love her. She assumed, and so did I, that a 4 star would safeguard against such \u201cclassic rip offs\u201d. No such luck. I decided it would not spoil my holiday. I took it like a man and my wife did too. We took a risk and trusted the pictures. This was a write off. I decided I would not have a go at the hotel staff but kick this place where it hurts. Their reviews. Breakfast was in the basement! NO DAYLIGHT! Ever heard of Solatubes? And, yet again, a horrible coloring. What a depressing place. There are plastic coated H-beams with rivets. Why an H beam should have rivets, beats me, but it looked like the high pressure feed hose of a plastic extrusion machine ripped just as the operator was taking a siesta. Granted, the breakfast was OK. \u2018Via Laietana\u2019, the road on which this hotel is resided, is one of the main arteries of Barcelona. 6 lanes of never ending traffic. Even on level 4 with sound stoppers, sleep was virtually impossible. It could have been prevented easy with double layer glass. Probably too expensive. The only good thing about this place is it\u2019s location. It\u2019s close to everywhere and we decided to turn mishap into fortune. It gave us the luxury of hopping to every neighborhood without doing detailed planning. Despite that, Barcelona is a nice place. I like it better than New York, Paris or London. More beauty, more clean and more laid back topped off with a pleasant sun and good food. If this review will keep off 10 potential guests I\u2019ll be laughing my head off. With this birdie, I guess we\u2019re even, mister hotel manager.", "Date": "May 8, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "2", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Service": "2", "Rooms": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "Winchester, UK", "Title": "\u201cTiny room.
