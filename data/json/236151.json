I was very impressed with how clean the rooms felt. That said, the rooms felt more like staying in a hostel. Little decor, no frills. My boyfriend and I ended up in a triple so the room was quite spacious for two people. (Three would have been cramped in my opinion, especially if you had suitcases.) There was not much hot water which added to the hostel feel. It never got icy, but lukewarm was the best it got. Our toilet would also not flush on random occasions. We also could hear everything going on in the hall and assumed that everyone could hear most of what we said in our room and walking down the hallway. Breakfast is included in the price which makes the price even more reasonable. The breakfast has good variety (meat, cheese, yogurt, breads, pastries, cake, cereal, coffee, tea, juice, water, milk but the pastries appeared to be and tasted like yesterday's leftovers and kinda stale). My boyfriend and I met a group of friends in Rome and we all stayed here. It was good for that because there is a lobby where we could all meet and plenty of seating so we could wait for each other. There is a computer there too so we could check on restaurants or email while we waited. The rooms also have internet. You need to ask at the desk for the code. There were no breakfast tables for 6 so we couldn't all sit together which was a little disappointing. The location was great! We all were very happy to be able to walk everywhere we wanted to go. The location seriously could not be any better. Also, if you take a taxi from the train station you should know that it should be around 10 euros. We paid more on our way there, not having any idea what Roman taxis charge.

The bathroom is an average size with limited counter space. This is an authentic big city hotel in a remodeled building- the kind of place I like, family run and not a Hilton or Holiday Inn.

We drove our car from Florence to Rome (a mistake we will NEVER make again!) and decided on the drive that we wanted to go directly to the Hertz Return at the airport to return the car. Originally, my husband was going to drop me at the hotel, then return the car. Words cannot describe how glad we were to NOT have done that as this hotel is in a very obscure location and we would probably still be driving around trying to find it. I digress - we called the hotel and asked if they could help us get a ride from the airport to the hotel. No problem, he couldn't have been more helpful. Best 50 euros ($75 US) we spent on the trip. I will say, however, that the initial contact on the phone was less than hopeful as communication was a bit challenging, but once he found our name on the roster, things got better. That's the positive. I agree wholeheartedly with the other reviews and all their criticisms. This hotel is wildly overpriced and the one reviewer must have had the same room as we did as our bathroom also smelled like urine. The room was adequate, at best. Dreary furnishings, etc. Bed was OK, and we really didn't complain of the room's size as we had just spent 10 days in France where the rooms barely hold the bed! The one gentleman at the front desk was nice, but there was one who was quite abrupt and often rude. We were on the 4th floor right next to the \"terrace\". I don't know what views the terrace provided, but it certainly was not the skyline of Rome! And I also don't know where the wine glasses, candles, etc., came from. There was no service on the terrace. It was small, and frankly annoying being so close to our room #406. The voices carried and we were tired after a long day of touring the city. Other than the urine smell in the bathroom, I really can't complain about the housekeeping. They changed our towels every day, which surprised us. We travel all the time both on business and pleasure, and we were shocked that water conservation was not considered. The only truly friendly employee of the hotel was a young man in the housekeeping department who greeted us every morning with a smiling face. We appreciated that as it all changed as you descended into the bowels of the hotel to the dining room. That is, without a doubt, the most unhappy, unfriendly, unsmiling, miserable staff of women I have ever encountered in our travels. No smile, no good morning, no nothing but glares. You were asked your room number, which baffled us as the buffet was included, and then the back was turned on you and that was the last dealings you had with the most miserable woman on the planet.

We chose this hotel as it was recommended by family who stayed there several years ago. After reading some of the reviews, we almost decided to cancel and book elsewhere. Well, we are very happy we did not. We were satisfied with our 5 night stay. 1. As mentioned the rooms are small. We were traveling with another couple and theirs was more spacious so not all rooms are the same. We were in the annex and on the 4th floor which had only the two rooms which was nice. Even though our room was on the small side, our closet was large enough that we unpacked and had room to put our suitcase away on the top shelf. The room was very clean and updated. 2. The location is terrific. It is very centrally located and we walked everywhere except to the Vatican, but that is doable as our family walked to it. It is in a wonderful neighborhood with several piazzas nearby and lots of restaurants and shopping. 3. The main reason I am writing is to address the statements about the staff. Our first impressions were that they were reserved, but polite. During our 5 day stay we had reason to have contact with them for several reasons and had very satisfactory results. My friend dropped 10 postcards into their mailbox in the lobby. The next day she realized she had not put enough postage on them. She explained this to the desk and they went out of their way to track down the cards (which had left the lobby but were still in the possession of the hotel management at another location) and get them back for my friend. Another day our camera had stopped working and we asked about where to purchase a new one. The gentleman behind the desk took the time to think about where to send us that would sell us a new camera at a reasonable price and gave us directions on how to get there. They also helped us find a place to have laundry done without once saying we should just have the hotel do it. One evening we were sitting in the lobby doing e-mail when a woman appeared (in her robe and slippers) with a glass in her hand. With hand on hip she said \"what is wrong with you Italians, I can't get ice anywhere in this country!\" The clerk walked around the desk, took her glass and went across the street to a cafe to get ice for her. When he returned he said \"madame, this is the way of Italy. When I visit America, I do not expect everything to be done for me the same as at home\" Well, good for him! My point is, maybe it is people with attitudes like hers that causes the staff to act less than friendly. I am not saying everyone acts this way and in fact know it is the minority, but none the less, we do reap what we sow. 4. The breakfast was more than adequate, with a good selection. The breakfast room is very pleasant. We stayed in 9 different locations on our month long trip and this was one of our more satisfactory breakfasts. We would not hesitate to book this hotel again if we should return to Rome.

I have been to Italy several times and I always like to stay near the Campo dei Fiori, but I wanted to try a new hotel since my last one left a lot to be desired. For the most part, I found the Hotel Smeraldo to be just fine. The room was nice, it was in a quiet location near everything, and for the location, I thought it was a very good value. However I think the breakfast the hotel offers at 7 euros, is not a good value. We opted to buy pastries at the bakery across the street from the hotel for 1 euro each and have cafe latte's at the cafe across the street for 1.5 euros each. We would spend usually less than 7 euros total for breakfast rather than the 7 euro per person the hotel charges. If anyone needs any fruit, there is an open air market in the campo dei fiori nearly every morning and the produce was wonderful! One word of warning: The hotel turns the power to your room off when you leave, and when we returned our first night after dinner and a night walk through Rome, the power wouldn't turn back on in our room. The man at the front desk tried to tell us it was our fault that we had plugged something in wrong and shorted the room out. We had not plugged anything in at all, we had literally dropped our luggage off and left for the day. We were eventually moved to another room, but while I was packing up my luggage in the dark (I had hung up some dresses in the closet for the wrinkles to fall out), the man at the front desk rung the room phone and asked us why were not coming down and we were wasting his time. I told him we were packing and would be down shortly and he said he didn't know what we were saying but to come down NOW. We were moved into what I assume is the handicap suite on the main floor. It was slightly larger and had no stairs, and we were fine in that room and the staff was fine from then on. But it was a bit annoying at the end of an evening when you are exhausted to have to change rooms, pack in the dark, and then be blamed for an electrical shortage there is no way you could have caused.

As I was planning for our trip a few months prior, I quickly became very discouraged as I was researching hotels in Rome. Unless we were prepared to pay a fortune, I was not able to find a reasonably priced hotel in central Rome that was clean. Everything was super expensive and some of the lesser expensive ones (125 - 200 Euros) had very mixed and poor reviews ... small rooms and not very clean. Then I came across the Smeraldo hotel which gave me much hope. We were very pleased with our choice. This relatively small hotel basically had everything we were looking for at a reasonably affordable price (by Roman standards). It is exceptionally well located near Campo di Fiori. We walked to many of the tourist sites from the hotel. It is located in a small and relatively quiet street, a few blocks away from a main street. At night, we walked to and from the many quaint Piazzas that were found within close proximity. Right across the hotel, there is a cafe and a restaurant and right around the corner, there is a wonderful bakery that serves fresh take out pizzas, paninis and other baked goodies at excellent prices. Lots of wonderful restaurants, cafes and shops can be found within walking distance. If you enjoy eating, you must try the Ristorante del Pallaro, a wonderful restaurant serving Roman food that is 2 blocks away from the hotel. For a very reasonable set price, there is a fixed 8 course menu, including wine, served in an outdoor terrace. Service was wonderful and the food was absolutely delicious. The room as well as the bathroom at the Smeraldo were very small, one of the smallest ones I have ever stayed in, but this seems to be the standard in Rome. If you know this as the outset, you will not be disappointed. After all, how much time will you spend in your room? It had all the basic amenities and was very clean which was extremely important to us especially in view of the reviews we read of other hotels located in central Rome. The view from our window was almost non-existent. For a wonderful view, however, the hotel has a rooftop terrace. The rooftop terrace was an excellent place to relax, to enjoy the views of Roman rooftops, and to eat something you bought outside the hotel and drink a wine you purchased. Although there are some reviewers of this hotel who found the service at the front desk to be poor, the gentlemen who were there during our stay were very professional, courteous and helpful. Breakfast at the hotel was simple ... breads, salami and cheese. The juice, however, tasted like powdered juice. Upon our arrival to Rome, one of the first things we did was take a tour bus around Rome. There are many such companies that provide the hop on and off tour bus option, allowing you to visit the various sites during a 12 or 24 hour period. There are some better ones, the double decker red bus being one of the better ones and I believe the original one. This is a good way to see the various sites and decide on which ones you want to visit in more detail. We loved Rome. It was my first time and I was very pleasantly surprised. It is one of my favourite major cities in the world. There is so much to do and visit in Rome ... 2 days are not enough. I found the prices generally reasonable, better than what I was anticipating. There are good bargains to be had in terms of shopping and dining. The pizzas sold by weight at the various pizzarias located thoughout Rome were truly delicious. For those who enjoy outdoor dining, there are many choices that will satisfy your tastes. Given the hotel's central location, its reasonable price, its clean rooms, the Smeraldo, a basic 3 star hotel, is an excellent value choice and we would definitely recommend it.", "Date": "October 19, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "4", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "CaWino", "Title": "\u201cGreat Value & Location\u201d", "Author": "CaWino", "ReviewID": "UR20647503", "Content": "The Smeralo is great value.

So if one of your party goes down to the continental breakfast served on the bottom floor, turns in the key, and one stays in the room to finish getting ready, the power is cut! \"You must tell me if one stays in the room,\" the desk guy told me after I reported our power going out.

It is very clear that the hotel is often used by kids/teenagers being away from their parents... unfortunately there was a group when we were there.

You can walk to the Forum, Colosseum, Spanish Steps, Trevi Fountain, the Vatican, etc. No need to cab it.

Also, some have said that the service wasn't that great. Honestly, they may not be over the top friendly but they answer your questions and provide you service. There's no rudeness at all.

It's safe and close to everything...everything you need in a hotel. If I can offer another word of advice...from the airport, take the train to Termini. It's the Leonardo Express. It couldn't be easier and takes maybe 20 minutes. We were somewhat mixed as to whether or not to try it and it was so incredibly easy, it would have been silly not to. It's 11 Euro and then a 6-7 Euro cab ride from Termini to just about any location in the city. you're going to spend half the money and you'll probably cut the time in half from taking a cab from the airport.

Water pressure was excellent and being two larger people we had no problems \"fitting\" in the shower (others had complained this would be a problem--not for us!). Yes...the room itself was tiny....but who cares? We compared it to a room in NYC....and we were rarely in there anyway. The hotel/room was clean as well.

When we first arrived I thought to myself, \"Uh Oh....the staff really are miserable SOB's as some people had commented\".....but after awhile they \"warmed up\" a bit and were more than helpful in arranging for our pick up to the airport the day of our departure. In fact, I recommend this service very much as the Taxi drivers can be somewhat inconsistent with their \"fairness\" in Rome. The driver arrived on time and it was a nice, comfortable car/ride. As for the breakfast....we didn't eat it....only because we enjoyed going across the street to the little cafe for our morning cappuccino and pastry. We unfortunately did not specify \"no breakfast\" upon booking so when I asked if we could delete breakfast from our room rate for the second two nights they said \"no\".....oh well...no biggie.

The cleaning staff was fastidious and very pleasant. We checked in around 12:00 noon and our room was ready and waiting. The rate was 120 Euros per night, per Rick Steves book. (We were required to pay for the entire stay upon check-in, which I did, and we had no problems, it actually made check-out a breeze.) The man at the front desk was very nice and showed us across the street to the Dependence. As two ladies traveling alone, my primary concern was safety. We ended up feeling very safe, because the glass door to the hotel is always locked and they buzz you in only after you ring the bell and they see you through the security camera. There were also security cameras in the elevator of the building and in the hallway outside our room. The bakery (Roscioli) right next door to the Dependence is FABULOUS!

We had been recommended this hotel by some friends who stayed here years ago and loved it. It met our needs and was a wonderful location. I would recommend this hotel to anyone looking for a reasonably priced hotel in a good location that has clean rooms and a competent staff. We don\u2019t regret our choice at all, and unless stumbling across a better deal \u2013 would stay here again. The hotel was always prompt returning emails. Anytime I emailed, they responded quite quickly. We used the hotels car transfer for 55\u20ac, and it was very good. Had I done my research I found there is a cheaper transfer through Rome Shuttle Limousine for 35\u20ac. But the hotel\u2019s car service was just fine and on time. The driver spoke some, but little English, which was fun because I was able to practice my Italian. When I had called, they mentioned we could probably check in when we arrived around 9:00am however, we ended up having to wait about 2 hours. They offered to let us keep our luggage in the back sitting room, but it wasn\u2019t secure so we opted to sit and wait. The front desk was friendly and fine. No one was rude. They were mostly helpful. The rooms were fine. Just that \u2013 rooms, no frills. Yes, the rooms were small, although large enough to be functional. Everything worked fine as well. No complaints. And the rooms were very clean. So for the location, the rooms were just what we had been looking for. The bathroom again, was small but functional. We did have problems with the water temperature. It wasn\u2019t always hot, and would get cold during the shower and yes\u2026 the fans in the bathroom are very loud. You aren\u2019t able to turn on the light separately, so you have no choice but to use them. And once you have turned off the light, the fan stays on for another 3-5 minutes. And I agree about the breakfasts. Not good. We were not smart enough to ask them to remove the breakfasts from our room price; we didn\u2019t know that was an option. The breakfasts were less than mediocre and consisted of hard bread, weird ham, cheese, and orange juice that was more like tang. We skipped breakfast there and went across the street most days. We loved the little place across the street. We LOVED their fresh squeezed red orange juice, and most mornings we each ordered caf\u00e9 latte, OJ and a pastry. For two, we usually paid about 8\u20ac. Our only other complaint was the noise. Not from the outside street\u2026 but from the other rooms. The walls were quite thin, and you could here quite a bit. I don\u2019t believe the other guests were necessarily being loud; I just think the walls were thin. However, the noise from the street was minimal, and what we did hear was fun to hear \u2013 scooters, mainly. But none of the noise was too bad\u2026 it\u2019s just an observation for those light sleepers out there. All that said, the location was the main perk. Very close to Campo di Fiori. Maybe a 3-5 minute walk. Also close to the Pantheon and Piazza Navona (maybe a 15 minute walk). We even walked to the Coliseum and yes, Vatican City. Although, we were quite tired after those walks. I wouldn\u2019t necessarily call those sites walking distance, but only a little over a mile maybe. Cabs were pricy there, and a little scary (scarier than NYC cabs). So we kept cab rides to a minimum. But although it may sound like I am nit-picking, we liked the hotel a lot and would return. I was just making honest statements so that readers can read all the facts and make a well informed decision. For the price, the hotel was just right and the location was even better. As for Rome, here are my tips on Rome: We did not find it unsafe and had no problems. Favorite dinners were at Ditrambo (a great option for Sundays, since many places are closed. It was our favorite restaurant in Rome and close to the hotel) and Matricianella near the Spanish Steps. We found ordering one antipasta, two first courses and sharing a second course was the best way to keep the bill down. We also ate at Colline Emiliane, and in my opinion it was not charming and was over-rated and over-priced. Also, Rome is much much larger than other cities we visited. We probably walked 2-3 miles a day at least. We didn\u2019t take buses or cabs much, and so maybe that is our own fault, but just a note to bring some comfortable walking shoes. Also, we did make the mistake of eating right on Campo di Fiori\u2026awful. Our waitress was from Pittsburg if that says anything. Eat right off the square at Ditrambo or Costanza. I also wish I got to try Da Armando al Pantheon near the Pantheon, but we never did. Another thing I noticed in Rome\u2026. Not as many people spoke English as I had expected. Everyone told me, \u201cOh, everyone in Rome speaks English.\u201d Not so true. Most everyone at restaurants and hotels did\u2026 and the main tourist sites\u2026but besides that\u2026 not so much. And not one of the cab drivers we dealt with spoke English. Luckily DH and I took a few courses last year and were in decent shape\u2026 but out of all the cities we visited, Rome was the most difficult to communicate in. Maybe we are rare\u2026 but that\u2019s what we found.", "Date": "March 24, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "2", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Merseyside", "Title": "\u201cNo complaints\u201d", "Author": "MerseysideTourist", "ReviewID": "UR7191656", "Content": "Seven of us stayed here on a \"girls\" weekend away for 3 nights in 3 rooms.

The fancy hotels on Via Veneto can't hold a candle to Smeraldo in terms of location, in my opinion. From the Smeraldo, you can pretty much walk everywhere (and we did!) A couple of things to beware of. First, the breakfast is horrible. Try to avoid buying it as part of your room rate. We had Rick Steves' current guidebook to Rome. After the first day, I inquired about excluding breakfast. They said it was included in our price. When I said the guidebook appeared to indicate otherwise, they asked if it was Rick Steves' book. I showed them my copy and they agreed to take 25 Euro off the price, per day, for no breakfast. 25 Euros was way more than needed for the three of us to have excellent continental breakfasts in the caffes nearby. Second, check out the fan in the bathroom when you check in. Others have complained about the noise and that was the first thing I noticed when I checked in. What a racket!

We also did the Bus and Boat tour for one day and that was really fun, $13 per person and u get a 30-40 minute bus ride around the city followed by a half hour boat ride, great deal!

The location in the twisty, old cobbled streets just off the Campo dei Fiori was wonderful. After a busy day sightseeing, the Campo is the perfect spot to sit with a glass of wine and people watch. Lots of great restaurants on the Campo and nearby. The hotel itself was really perfect -- very clean, recently rennovated, with a polite and helpful staff. Our room on the third floor was roomy with a king-size bed (wonderful mattress!) and lots of storage space (which is handy when you are staying as long as we did and don't want to live out of your suitcase). We were lucky to have a room that opened to the back of the hotel -- we could see one of the hotel's terraces and the dome of a nearby church from our window. We slept with the window wide open, shutters thrown out and it was as quiet as if we were in a remote Tuscan village -- hard to believe in a city as noisy as Rome! The bathroom was very modern -- small shower stall but perfectly adequate unless you are an oversize person and the water was always hot. The breakfast was great -- Continental style but who needs a heavy, hot breakfast if you are eating a big lunch (Roman style) and dinner.

We paid 125E per night, a rate guaranteed if we showed them our Rick Steves Italy 2005 book which recommends it. We read all of the reviews on tripadvisor and found the hotel to exceed our expectations. Hotel Smeraldo is in a lovely neighborhood, just a 3 or 4 minute walk to the Campo de Fiori. The rooms are tastefully decorated and most of the furnishings as well as the bathroom appeared to be almost new. The bed was quite firm and we thought we would find it uncomfortable to sleep on but this was not the case. We slept fine and the firmness of the mattress did not bother us at all which was a surprise. The room was extremely clean and maid service was excellent. As suggested in the Rick Steves book, we asked for a \"quiet\" room (away from the street) and although we were told they would do their best but could not guarantee this, they accomodated us and we had very quiet room away from the street. The maid service starts by 8 a.m so if you like to sleep late you might be annoyed by the noise generated in the halls during their cleanups.They had a \"hairdryer' which is a nozzle that comes out of the wall and it blows hot air. If you need to style your hair, bring your own with a converter/adapter. Warm, hot water was plentiful if you took your shower early. Our daughter took a shower a bit later once and only got lukewarm water. Upon our return to Rome and Hotel Smeraldo (we went to Siena for several days then came back to SMeraldo for one night), we were in a room that faced the street and it was rather noisy (street traffic,etc) but we took care of this by leaving the bathroom fan on all night. This worked like a charm in blocking out the noise. THey also gladly stored most of our luggage in the luggage room for us when we traveled to Siena (we came back to Smeraldo as I previously stated) so we would not have to drag it back and forth with us. There was no charge for this. Many reviews have stated that the staff is unfriendly or rude. They were a bit aloof at times, but since I knew that this might be a problem before I came there, I decided to go out of my way and be friendly to them each time I saw them. I would greet them in Italian and smile at them every time I passed the reception desk. Try it everywhere in Italy and you will be pleasantly surprised. They speak excellent English but seemed to appreciate my effort to greet them intheir language. They always helped me with anything I needed. They are not very social,but people should not miscontrue this to mean they are rude and unfriendly.Shy and somewhat aloof at times,perhaps but certainly not rude. Read about the Italians and their customs etc before you go and don't expect everything to be like it is in the US. Breakfast is available for about 8E per person but we did not buy it and it did not look like anyone else did either. There was only one person there making coffee our first morning and no one was even there on the subsequent mornings. Walk right our the door and cross the street and take a few steps to your left and there is an excellent cafe. Very reasonable coffee and cornettos(like a croissant). Remember though, you are in Italy and will pay extra if you sit. Eat at the bar and it is very cheap. You are a 5 minute walk from the bus stop and 10-20 minutes from most of the big attractions(Pantheon,Piazza Navonna, Colosseum,etc). The Vatican would probably be the longest walk --about 20 -25 minutes maximum. If you don't want to walk it, just take the bus 64 allthough it is usually very crowded and you will probably stand. There are many restaurants in the Campo de Fiori neighborhood in all price ranges. You can also stop at one of the nighborhood shops and pick up a slice of pizza for 1 or 1.50E.

When you walk in, it's a whole different picture. They recently renovated and it is a nice, clean and comfortable hotel. 2. The bathroom is small. I am not trying to offend so please do not take this the wrong way. Realistically, if you have trouble fitting in airplane seats, you will most likely have difficulty with the size of the shower. And I find this an important point to bring up because it has such great impact on your experience at this hotel. Our room and bathroom were very small but were always clean and had been redone not too long ago. The bathroom was all marble and looked very nice. When we got there, the AC was on and it was very cold in there.
