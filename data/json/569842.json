My boyfriend and I were on a 2 week trip, with a week in both London and Dublin. As we have JUST finished college we had a very strict budget. The price is what drew me to Baker's Hotel in the first place. We had a triple room (their double was already booked so they gave us a good rate) for 48 pounds per night. Since my boyfriend and I were splitting everything, this was a GREAT deal. Everyone needs to realize that if you're going to stay in central London you're going to pay a very high price, ESPECIALLY with exchange rates as they are. 48 pounds sounds like a lot when its converted to USD but in relation to anything else you could find, its fantastic. First off, I know a lot of reviewers complained about the owner but we have nothing but WONDERFUL things to say about him. We showed up at the hotel at 10am after flying in overnight from Chicago. We were dead to the world. He asked that we give him enough time to get the room clean and then we could check in. We were in within a couple hours even though check in wasn't until 2. He helped us book our sightseeing tour (and gave us a discount), he checked us in online for our flight, and gave us advice on what to see and do each day. He also set up a private taxi to get us to the airport for MUCH less than we paid to get there and knocked on our door at 5am when the taxi arrived. He was great and he doesn't deserve all the slander he has received from other reviewers. As I mentioned before, the hotel is cheap so you shouldn't expect the red carpet to be rolled out for you. We had no problem with our room. We had a double bed which was plenty for the two of us, space to put our luggage, a sink and mirror, a window that opened onto a small balcony, a small closet, a couple chairs, and a tv. All we needed was a place to sleep as we spent the majority of the day sightseeing. The breakfast in the morning is very simple, cereal, toast, juice, etc. It was just the perfect amount to get us energized for the day until mid afternoon when we had lunch. The owner was down there and chatted with us while we ate. Victoria Coach Station and Victoria Train Station are about a 5 minute walk. It was incredibly convenient and everything goes to Victoria. We were able to catch our tour bus at the Coach station and all of our tube routes from Victoria. You're also in walking distance of Buckingham Palace and Hyde Park. The ONLY negative thing I could say about this hotel would be that they charge to loan you a towel (we bought some souvenier towels and used those) and they charge to use the internet (like most hotels do, although you can usually find an unsecure wireless signal if you search hard enough). We stayed for 6 nights and had a fantastic time! Dont come here if youre expecting special ammenities and room service. This hotel is great for people that just need a place to sleep.

We consider ourselves very flexible travelers that can easily adapt to various conditions. This hotel/BB left us very disappointed and angry. First, when you walk in, the 'Lobby' is completely cluttered with personal stuff and closed/locked most of the time. Not sure how many family/friends permanently stay there. If you return in the evening, you will see the manager and a host of friends/family in the 'Lobby' crouched in the dark around the TV. We stayed in Quad room in basement the first two nights. The room was dirty, the bed coverings were filthy, the lights over the sink didn't work, and there was a constant odor of natural gas in the hallway. When you are using the shared bathroom (a tiny closet with folding door containing toilet, sink and 2x2 shower stall), you can sit there and enjoy the mold on the walls or count the bugs walking around your feet. We came back after our second day out to find the bathroom floor soaked from toilet overflow. OK, it's a budget hotel, maybe a little dirt or grime can be excused. However, grime added with a nasty hotel manager can not. Not sure if this middle Eastern kid is a friend or relative of the owner, but his people and service skills are abysmal at best. Without ever raising an issue about the grime or smell, at breakfast the first morning, my wife came into the dining 'nook' about 10-15 minutes before serving time was to end. We were curtly told we would have to get there earlier the following morning if we wanted to be served. Being 'served' consists of helping yourself to juice or coffee, one of two choices of cereal flakes, and then having him standing there manning the toaster (while glowering at you as you eat) for your 2-slice ration of white bread toast. After three nights, and a mandatory change of rooms on the third night, do you think we could have been spared a single clean towel?? Not without an extra charge! Common, for 70 pounds a night, they can't spare even one of their cheap and flimsy towels?Oh, and if you want to use their WiFi, pony up some more pounds for that as well. When I asked to speak to the owner, I was told I could not because he was \"at work\" and could not be reached. Our last night, two of the three shared bathrooms were out of commission and I heard grumbling from other guests that they didn't have any towels.

Despite his unprofessional demeanour, we were appreciative of his willingness to store our luggage whilst we went out exploring. Upon checking into our room later in the day, several surprises were awaiting us: 1. The rooms are tiny! Two twin beds (interestingly described as a double on the website), a small tv and a sink which hangs precariously off the wall. Luggage needs to be stratgically placed in the room so that the door is still able to be opened. 2. The shared bathrooms are filthy. We were expecting budget, and have absolutely no problem with shared bathrooms, however they should be (a) heated in the middle of winter, (b) clean, (c) toilet paper is handy as well. 3. The linen.... my bed had an apparently clean bottom sheet, however through the sheet a HUGE blood stain on the mattress protector was clearly visible. I tried not to allow my imagination to run away with me on that one... 4. The complimentary used condoms under my husband's bed.... seriously, three used and tied up condoms just sitting there.... just another example of the disgraceful hygiene standards of this \"hotel\". 5.

The tonnes of lavender airfreshener used by the owners just add some subtle floral notes to the mould.... I really could go on, but I think this gives a fair overview of our experience at Baker's. Yes, the place is cheap, but money is not always the most important factor, especially when you're sleeping above someone else's condoms. Spend just a bit extra elsewhere for comfort and peace of mind.", "Date": "January 28, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "3", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Lyon, France", "Title": "\u201cGreat value for money in Westminster!\u201d", "Author": "Dr_J9", "ReviewID": "UR12121940", "Content": "I arrived 8:30am at the hotel after an 11-hr flight from Johannesburg. Needless to say, I was brain dead and needed sleep asap. The usual check in time at the hotel is 14:00, but the guy on duty was so kind as to check me in at 9:30am. I was sooooo pleased! I stayed in room 5. It's small, but clean and a view of St George's Street. Luckily I always travel with ear plugs and an eye mask, so the traffic noise didn't bother me. Very good value for money in the posh City of Westminster. The hotel is a mere 5-min walk from Victoria bus station, which is really convenient, as I had to catch a bus to Stansted airport at 4:00am after my stay. The shower and toilet were downstairs and really clean - Scandinavian standard! I will definitely stay here again. It's a safe, clean and great place to crash in the evening after partying and exploring all the great sites in London.", "Date": "December 31, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "4", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Vancouver, Canada", "Title": "\u201cgood value and good location\u201d", "Author": "san1983", "ReviewID": "UR10241120", "Content": "Stayed in Bakers' hotel near Victoria station for 2 nights, got a sigle room on 1 st floor, small as I expected but very clean.

We basically picked it because it got good reviews as well as being cheap (we are 3 20-year olds on a tight budget). The location was good, right near Victoria Station which made it convenient going places. We were in the triple (room 7 I believe) and it was cramped with just enough room for all of our suitcases. The 3 beds were pushed together which surprised me but it was fine. Upon arriving we were welcomed by the son and since it was too early to get to our room we were allowed to leave our stuff in the locked lobby area. He was also kind enough to tell us where the bathrooms were so we could freshen up a bit. While the room was simple, it suited us for what we wanted: cheap, kind of centrally located, breakfast, and just a place to sleep at night. In order to enjoy the time spent in this B & B you need to spend the day out of the room. Every day we left around 9 to sight see and be tourists around London, we didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t need a nice room since we weren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t planning on spending time in it. My only suggestions if you stay here: -ask for a towel (they are not in the room or bathroom, we had to ask for 3 and we used them for the full week) -if you don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t like noise bring earplugs (there is traffic outside every night which didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t bother me since I was used to the sounds of Boston but bothered my 2 friends) -bring shoes to walk to and from the bathroom (down a flight of stairs) -be prepared for minimal options for breakfast: toast, corn flakes, bran flakes, oj, tea, instant coffee I would probably stay here again because you can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t beat the price and overall I had a good experience.", "Date": "September 22, 2007"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Bakers Hotel", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g186338-d569842-Reviews-Bakers_Hotel-London_England.html", "Price": "$73 - $222*", "Address": "<address class=\"addressReset\"> <span rel=\"v:address\"> <span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">126 Warwick Way</span> | <span class=\"extended-address\">Victoria</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:locality\">London</span> <span property=\"v:postal-code\">SW1V 4JA</span></span>, <span class=\"country-name\" property=\"v:country-name\">England</span> </span> </span> </address>", "HotelID": "569842", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/01/fa/bb/a3/bakers-hotel.jpg"}}
