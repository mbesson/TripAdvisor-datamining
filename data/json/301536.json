Thanks to all of you guys, you are wonderful. as per the hotel I have to say is old building over all is not in a good shape, little water coming through the shower and some rooms can be smelly. But the worse is the noise. On the second or third floor is the african disco that makes shake the whole building and not one can sleep till the disco closes at 3am. More over at night as a man is very hard to get to the hotel as per the street in fromt to the hotel is packed with prostitutes that literary grab you and offer, where like or not, their services.", "Date": "December 28, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "2", "Sleep Quality": "2", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Service": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Thane", "Title": "\u201ca pure night life place\u201d", "Author": "vivekkmehta", "ReviewID": "UR112229109", "Content": "You can find everything at this place.

He even had the same mannerisms as him/moustache/accent the works. As soon as I saw him I cracked up and couldn't stop laughing. WISH I got a picture with him now.

No internet facilities. Rooms were clean Main problem I had was the porters in the reception area had absolutely no manners and were continually and rudely challanging guests to identify themselves in the evening.

The sour receptionist gave us a room many floors away from the niteclub. At first the dimmed lights made the rooms ok untill further inspections. The sheets were stained and not changed at all (no crisp iron lines). The bathroom was scummy and the shower leaked onto the floor making it slippery. The toilet didnt flush and it took 2 attempts from the maintenance man to fix it. You need to take earplug as the noise from the niteclub and the tooting traffic will drive you insane.

The only problems are a smelly entrance hotel hall because of a pizzeria there, and the prior of a mosque which wakes us up in the very early morning (then you go back to sleep): you are in the Emirates, don't forget! It is really worth it, because of the price, the location (in the center, easy to catch a taxi, a supermarket and a pharmacy just near) and the cleanliness. We will come back there. If you want better, you'll find hotels at double price, at least. We were with 3 children, so we got 2 rooms, but if you go there with 2 kids, they told us that one room is OK (the room have a sofa bed).
