I was lucky enough to visit many hotels and gage their level of amenities before actually booking an apartment. When I walked into Ziqoo I was pleasanlty surprised at the presentation - it was very modern, clean, furniture was immaculate and it felt like a 5* hotel - very impressive. The staff are very courtieous and extremely professional. They were very nice to my kids and made us feel very welcome. The actual room is very very very impressive - it is actually like the rooms displayed on their website - I can only describe as WOW !!!!. I had the pleasure to stay at this hotel for 3 weeks and this quite a long time in which you can really see the level of service. I can honestly stay that the level of service was very high for the whole period.

The rooms are well equipped, clean and serviced everyday without fail. The kitchens are also fully equipped with washing machine, cooker, large fridge/freezer, microwave and plenty of cupboard space. Having lived in the UAE for a few years I was pleasantly surprised by the excellent customer service at Ziqoo, it has to be one of the best I've experienced here, even compared to 5 star hotels, the staff always seemed genuinely pleased to help.

On arrival, we got a taxi and drove through the city centre, pass the malls, buildings etc until there was nothing else left and on the road to Abu Darbi and then we drove off the main road to the hotel! We then realised we had made a mistake. This hotel is nowhere near the city center or beach and would require the continued use of taxis to and from places, which was going to be costly. Check in was fairly smooth but on stepping into our studio room, we expected it to be larger. It simply presented as a standard themed 3 star hotel room with a washing machine and oven/cooker. The bathroom was small and standard. We were alittle disappointed. We did go down to speak to reception staff about this but was told a silly cost for an up-grade so we stayed where we was, especially knowing that now more money will be going on taxis. On then asking them what there was to do and about the metro train service, the information recieved was a little confusing and thoughout our stay, we got no information about things to do in Dubai or the additional hotel services of the hotel from front desk. So we were on our own! In the end, due to the cost of taxis, we hired a car and I had purchased a book on Dubai with a road map included in the UK and we explored Dubai oursleves. However, staying in this hotel affected our overall holiday as you are far away from everything, there is no information from front desk about things to do, no excursion options, far from the beach and had no pool. And although I appreciate the Japanese theme and furnishings, its room facilities and cleaniliness, in my travelling experience, this hotel presented as a 3 star plus and I was quite disappointed. And on our travels, my partner pointed out other hotels which were of similar price in much better locations, some of which I had seen through my own research. So I know that if I had had a hand in booking our hotel, I would not have booked this hotel. I think this hotel is fine if you have friends/family in Dubai, work in Dubai or know you way around Dubai and need long-term stay. But if it is your first time in Dubai, stay at another hotel in a better location. Don't let your hotel stay completely alter your holiday as it did mine.", "Date": "December 26, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Perth, Australia", "Title": "\u201cCharming hotel\u201d", "Author": "Spaussiesh", "ReviewID": "UR90280971", "Content": "Located in the outskirts of Dubai, in a quiet green area, Ziqoo is at 12 minutes walking distance from the Ibn Battutah Shopping Mall and 17 minutes from the Ibn Batuttah Metro Station. My room (a studio deluxe room) was very spacious, with quality classy furniture, great hard bed, beautiful colours and atmosphere, with a fully equipped kitchen (huge fridge, washing machine/dryer, rice cooker, toaster, microwave, electric stove, and basic kitchen and cooking utensils), a huge LCD TV with a good selection of international and local channels, and even a charming balcony with a table and chair. The common areas, as well as the room, are extremely clean and tidy, and the corridors have a classy decoration and the floors shine like a mirror. I found the area very quiet at night despite the existence of a small mosque nearby. The staff (reception desk, maintenance and cleaners) are very polite, sweet and hardworking people. My especial thanks to Lorraine Rodriguez, who was extremely helpful during my arrival and stay at the hotel. There is a big supermarket (Geant) at the Tunisia section of the Mall, so you can buy anything you want there. For an emergency you have an Indian convenience store next door and a few restaurants and other services in the neighbourhood. Despite what the hotel\u2019s website an different booking sites mention, there is no tour desk at the hotel, and the person at the reception desk takes care of booking tours with just one company, and gives you some maps, general info, and the Big Bus brochures; if you need extra info or booking with other companies they tell you politely to do the booking and call yourself. The distance to the city centre might be a problem if you want to be close to the main Dubai sights, if you have mobility problems, or you carry a lot of luggage from the metro, as you have to walk 17 minutes to-from the metro station (you also need to know the fire exits to go through the mall if you need to catch a train before 10am, as the main exits to the MS are closed before that time). Just to give you an idea, going to the Dubai Mall takes about 30 minutes from the IBMS, whereas Deira City and the old Dubai area are at about 45-50 minutes from the IBMS, plus the walking distance to-from the station. The Internet is LAN and good speed but a bit expensive for Western standards unless you pay for a 24 hour voucher; log out from your session or you will lose the remaining credit. You might need to refresh your cookies often to allow the hotel\u00b4s system program to operate. There were just two power points in my room, and both of them had a switchboard connected, so the points are overcrowded if you need to use 2-3 gadgets/devices. There was just one power point in the bathroom, and that only for shavers. If you are a woman, you have to do your hair in the room; the lighting of the bathroom is poor and I would suggest a small lightened mirror for women. No dish-washing liquid sachet provided in the kitchen, and that is the first time in an apartment hotel that happens to me. I had to buy a whole bottle for my 9 day visit. The ceiling lights went off during my first day there, because of the fuses, and the handyman who fixed the problem (a very sweet and efficient guy) requested me not to use many lights at the same time, but I was using minimal lights and the aircon was off. The number of wardrobes is humongous, but there was not a specific space to keep a big suitcase in there. You\u2019ll need to book your breakfast in advance because, if you decide to have it on arrival, it will be impossible. You\u2019ll be charged for an early checking even if the hotel is not full, or at least that was my case. The service was poor despite the courtesy and hard work of the staff. MY RECOMMENDATION If you want a quiet location, a place located near the Metro and a shopping mall, good quality rooms and quietness for a business trip, this is your place. I would go for a one-bedroom apartment if I had to visit again, but the studios are great if you are on a budget and still want plenty of room and a fully equipped kitchen. The hotel is outside Dubai, therefore, if you go on holidays, make sure that you book your tours and pick-ups in advance. That will save you a big headache as the local companies I tried do not work according to Western standards. The metro is great and reliable and will take you anywhere for a small fee; the walk to-from the hotel is very nice and quiet and you will enjoy that if you like walking. I would certainly recommend the hotel for business/work related stays, or for independent travellers who have at least 5 days at Dubai.", "Date": "December 20, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "TOKYO", "Title": "\u201cStaffs were helpful\u201d", "Author": "TOKYOJourneylover", "ReviewID": "UR83104034", "Content": "Since it was my first trip to Dubai even any Mid east, I had less information, so I had asked many questions through email to staffs here before trip.

Though the ZiQoo Apartments are in an identical building, the ambience and feel could not be more different - in this case significantly better and calming. A lovely aquarium in the foyer with the sound of running water. Attentive front desk personnel and housekeeping staff who run to open doors, press the lift buttons, ask if they can help with your bags. Almost embarrassing for someone from Britain where service comes grudgingly if at all! The apartment furnishings are excellent - a mini chaise longue in my deluxe studio, a beautiful large tripod leg lamp, plenty of socket outlets and extension leads, a really nice halogen desk lamp and of course that wonderful firm but stylish bed - with lights underneath - nice touch! Kitchen has everything I needed making my purchases needed at the previous place redundant. Out on the balcony, there are two wooden chairs and a table, there is a vacumn cleaner and iron. A storage storage storage! A lovely desk with lots of drawers. The bathroom is functional - it is not some Bauhaus stand up shower but it is functional clean and with a good powerful shower. Where there have been small problems - someone had clearly burnt their clothing with the apartment iron - that was replaced in five minutes, cleaning and fresh towels most days and when I forget to do my wahing up, it gets done for me - again makes me feel lazy!! Internet connection is cabled but it is pretty fast (the whole of Dubai seems to have slow Internet compared to UK) but cable in my view is better that a weak WiFi signal which is often the case on higher floors in a building like this. I have already mentioned excellent service - the car parking area below is free and ZiQoo have a reserved area. You get a notice if you fail to display your parking authorisation card. The other night I got a call to say that my rental car interior lights had been left on and they were worried the battery would run down - that's service. Con's? I am struggling - there's one Muzak track with crazed trumpeting that opos up at night but that has been attended to, and something beyond the hotel's control is the traffic in the morning exiting the Discovery Gardens area - due to what seems to be totally inept traffic engineering and planning, there can be long queues to get into the one lane out of the place on weekday mornings. Similar problems can arise on the way back - but my tip is - southbound on Sheikh Zayed Road, take Discovery Gdns turn off, get into left hand lane as you cross on flyover, then after first lights, get into right hand land before left turn for ZiQoo, then don't join the inevitabel queue in left hand lane, stay in left hand straight ahead lane and when lights go green turn left from straight ahead lane. Perfectly legal and could save you 10 mins getting back here if you are driving. Other tips for British travellers, there's a nice if expensive Waitrose in Marina Mall less than 10 minutes away across Sheikh Zayed Road - great bread and other home comforts - free parking too (at the time of writing - Feb 2010). Been here a month already and about to extend for another. Highly recommended if you don't need to be in central Dubai and are working in Marina, Jebel Ali or Jumeirah Lake Towers areas of Dubai i.e on road to Abu Dhabi before Jebel Ali.", "Date": "February 20, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Laurel, Maryland", "Title": "\u201cZQ: not ideal for me, but maybe for you?\u201d", "Author": "KittyChan", "ReviewID": "UR56315247", "Content": "Dubai has some of the world's fines -- and most expensive -- 5-star hotels (not to mention the \"7-star\" Burj Al-Arab, but for my most recent visit, I decided to give the 4-star ZiQoo a try. Two factors swayed me: its very hip Japanese vibe, and the low price on Expedia (just under $80/night) for my early-February weekend stay. I'm glad I did. While I'm not sure I'll stay at ZiQoo on a future visit to Dubai, the small hotel (10 floors or so) has quite a bit to recommend it. Pros: 1. Quasi-Japanese ambience: ZiQoo's reception area is lovely and rather Zen. The hotel promises Japanese-speaking staff availability around the clock; indeed, when I checked in -- at 2 a.m. -- Kawagoe-san humored my so-so Japanese, quickly checked me in, and gave me just the right amount of useful information. He also gave me an upgrade from my reserved standard to a deluxe studio flat -- not something I recall happening at hotels at which I've stayed in Japan! The signs and labeling in the hotel and the room are completely bilingual -- even the instruction manuals for the kitchen appliances were in a neat binder with thorough Japanese translations! (In fact, I don't remember seeing any Arabic anywhere in the hotel, although the huge Sony LCD TV featured the usual complement of local and and pan-Arab channels one finds at high-end hotels in Dubai.) 2. Price: As mentioned, I paid what I thought was an excellent price for a good-sized studio flat in a solid 4-star property, and I don't think the standard studio flat costs much more than $100/day, even at regular rates. My Expedia rate didn't include breakfast or internet access, though. 3. Rooms: My \"deluxe\" studio was well furnished and laid out: bathroom just the right of the entry, small kitchen in the middle, and decent-sized sitting area and bedroom last. The furnishings were attractive and modern, and the bed was large and very comfortable. The studio wasn't luxurious, but it was quite nice. As mentioned, the new Sony flat-screen TV was huge and had a wide array of international channels. The bathroom was quite plain, but everything worked, and it was very clean. I had two bottles of complimentary drinking water and a little basket with packets of tea and coffee, as well as a few snacks; however, none of these items (not even the coffee or water) was replenished during room service. Neither pro nor con: 1. Service: ZiQoo is not a full-service hotel, which is fine with me. There is a Japanese restaurant -- I didn't try it, but the dinner buffet, at 66 AED, seemed very reasonable -- and a spa. The front desk staff varied in terms of their skill level and helpfulness, but Kawagoe-san, the night clerk, was very helpful and provided good suggestions for a number of things. Cons: 1. Location: ZiQoo is far north of Dubai proper, in Jebel Ali, adjacent to the Ibn Battuta Mall (which is quite nice although aging a bit; not to worry, they're expanding and renovating it). Otherwise, there's little of interest or use nearby, and longish taxi rides are necessary to get to the interesting areas of the emirate. The taxi from the airport cost 80 AED, but most of that is on the Sheik Zayed expressway, and ZiQoo is located just off one of the major interchanges. Taxis can be hard to get at the hotel, and when I booked one well in advance to depart at 19:30, it was not there by 19:40, and I finally had to flag an \"Airport\" cab on the main road. Not a big deal, though, and there is a (not yet open) Metro station (Ibn Battuta) withing walking distance of ZiQoo. 2. Service: As mentioned above, the front-desk staff's service skills were not always what they should be; I received a wake-up call 30 minutes after the requested time. But overall, the service was roughly on par with what I've experienced at other 4- and 5-star hotels in the Emirates. 3. Internet: ZiQoo doesn't have wifi, and the wired internet service in the room is rather slow and expensive (100 AED/day, I think). All in all, I'd recommend ZiQoo to someone who's been to Dubai before and doesn't mind its far-out location. I'll probably stay elsewhere on future visits, although if I come across sub-$80/night rooms, I may be persuaded for an encore stay.", "Date": "February 17, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "lowestoft suffolk", "Title": "\u201cclean tidy and modern apartment/hotel with friendly & efficient staff\u201d", "Author": "juliebabes33", "ReviewID": "UR50572234", "Content": "The ZiQoo hotel apartments are based in Discovery Gardens, on the outskirts of Dubai, close to Dubai Marina, Ibn Battuta shopping mall, and Jebel Ali.
