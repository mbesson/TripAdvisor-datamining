This not a hotel, B&B, or a pension; it is basically a room in an apartment. A manager will meet you to check you in and check you out, but not much else--and you had better make precise arrangements to meet with them when you arrive. We arrived earlier than we had stated and were stuck outside the building on a busy Rome street in the middle of a hot day. But after we eventually settled in (a phone call by another renter reached the manager), we were happy with the clean, spacious, quiet room w/ excellent AC. Kitchen with stove, refrig., dishes, pots, bottled water, etc. readily available. Location is 10 minute walk from train station and from a metro stop from which you can reach most attractions. Still requires a lot of walking to do anything in Rome, and this place is not strategically located. Other than an initial orientation to attractions and transportation from the manager, we were entirely on our own with just our guide books. Do not expect any advice or assistance beyond that. Neighborhood is very ethnic (Asian, Indian) but felt very safe to us. Not far from pleasant park, some small restaurants.

Cromata Rooms had good reviews so I just went for it. Given its price and proximity to the train station (5-10 minute walk) I expected something seedy. We were delighted to find a pretty, modern, immaculately clean room, much bigger than expected, and extremely quiet. This is not a hotel or a hostel: it's literally just three rooms (each with private bathroom) and a small, communal kitchen on the third floor of an apartment building. There's no sign, just a buzzer downstairs for \"Three Rooms Cromata.\" A staff person (I don't remember her name) was waiting when we arrived. She checked us in, took the payment, gave us a map and directions, and left us with our own key to the room and the downstairs entry. That was it! Every easy, very simple, and no frills. My husband thinks it's brilliant. Communication was great and the woman who met us was really nice and helpful. I've only given \"service\" three stars not because of quality (what we had was great!) but because there are no extras that some people might usually expect, like 24-hours reception, a restaurant, or room service. But personally, I'd much rather just have a great room and a comfortable bed.. There is free, fast Wi-fi, and someone does clean the room while you're out. The metro and train station are 5-10 minutes away; the Colosseum is a lovely, 20 minute walk. Breakfast is at a cafe down the block: your choice of coffee, and either a croissant or a simple breakfast sandwich. I highly recommend this wonderful gem of a place. We were very happy with everything about it and will definitely stay there again if we come back to Rome.", "Date": "April 11, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Highlands Ranch, Colorado", "Title": "\u201cSO COMFORTABLE, SO CLOSE TO EVERYTHING & YET AWAY FROM NOISE\u201d", "Author": "stellgp", "ReviewID": "UR89184135", "Content": "The rooms are on the 3rd floor of an attractive apartment building (entrance not easily seen).

We stayed here for 2 nights and I tried to extend my stay for another night but the place was fully booked! Cromata is located near (2 min walk) the Victorio Emanuelle train station which is one stop away from Termini (the central train station of Rome). We walked every day to Termini and all the important sites (including the Colosseum) from this hotel. Cromata is also a little isolated from the unending crowd and noise of Repubblica and yet it's walking distance to it. I thought that was a perfect location. The hotel is located in an apartment building and there is no 24 hour reception. The breakfast is served in a cafe close by (choice of coffee/cappucino and a pastry or sandwich). There is a lift so it's convenient for people with luggage. Also wi-fi is free. It's not the best signal but it worked well enough. If you are to go to the Cromata rooms website, you will see pictures of each of it's 3 rooms. The rooms look exactly like the pictures. Very clean and well decorated. I really enjoyed my stay at Cromata. Convenient location, good service, comfortable and clean room were some of the things that I found precious. And the price...very reasonable (at time of review).

If you use the side entrance of Termini station (which is recommended when going to the airport), trains and metro are like 10min walk away. The street is very noisy, but you get used to it. The breakfast solution in the cafe might not be for everyone but it's good quality food in an authentic Roman location. All in all fantastic value for money.

As commented before, the location is definately a little bit daunting when you arrive, luckily we arrived in the daytime though. The owner was fantastic - giving us a map and pointing out lots of locations to eat and marking them for us on it - in particular suggestions for eating out at night (one of which we went to and loved it!) He also gave us his mobile for any probelms (which there weren't) The rooms were lovely and very clean and serviced every day! And yes it is a very noisy street which it is located but we can honestly say we found it no problem to sleep and managed more than one lie in! (although I do wear ear plugs which to me are an absolute godsend) but my partner doesn't and is normally a very light sleeper and he slept great he tells me!! Maybe the good food, lovely wine and lots and lots of walking in the daytime helped there then!! Location wise it isn't brilliant - quite far from most places except maybe the colosseum which is within maybe a 15-20min walk at most! (Good for us getting the train in from Florence to termini station as walk to hotel with bags only 10mins or so!) But we discovered the metro which was brilliant for us and only a 5-10 min walk at most to it from hotel and it stopped at pretty much all the main areas we wanted to go to in no time at all!! At night we tended to get a cab back to the hotel as we didn't find it all that expensive (we were on a budget also) as we weren't too keen on the metro at night or walking the neighbourhood at night but to be honest after 3 or 4 days there we realised it probably wasn't as bad an area as we thought (although still played it safe with taxi at night). We did have to walk at least 10-15min for breakfast though and did feel little uneasy in the cafe as they didn't seem too overjoyed with our little ticket and sat us away through the back of the place (coffee and croissant were lovely though!!) We only used this our 1st morning and did our own thing the rest of the stay - our choice though and because our budget we had set more than allowed us to do so!

First and most important (as another recent review has made clear), you will be staying in a converted 3 bedroom apartment, it is not a hotel, there is no-one to speak to if you need something like extra loo roll or shower gel etc, plus of course it is a 5 minute walk for breakfast which is in a cafe on a street corner about 1.5 blocks away (with very poor directions on where to find it - we went the wrong way down the road on first attempt and wasted 20 minutes in blistering heat to find it), I will come back to the location shortly as this may also affect your decision. The room itself is fine, but nothing like their own webiste makes it out to be, I travel regularly on business and have stayed in several boutique hotels which have great bedrooms with interesting design's & colour combinations plus wonderful bathrooms with galss walls etc. The Cromata is not in any way a boutique hotel, here the positive & negative facts rather than war & peace with my opinion: Negatvies: 1) It is on a very noisy street due to a one-way traffic system, it will definatley keep you awake unless you already sleep right next to a busy road which has constant traffic from 5am-1am with regular beeping on horns & noisy scooters - there are no rooms at the back to move to either. 2) The street and neighbourhood is very scruffy with dog's sh*t on the pavements, graffiti on all the walls and well away from the \"civilised\" streets of Rome, it is not a pleasant walk to or from the apartment at anytime, and perhaps a little scary at night for ladies - my wife was not impressed! 3) There are no nice places for a meal or drink nearby (unless you are on a very strict budget), this will always require a bus or metro ride or a 15 minute walk (except for the breakfast of course) 4) It is further from the main entrance of the train/bus terminal then you think, again at least 15-20 minutes, put it this way the main terminal is one stop away from the nearest Metro station at Piazza Vittorio Emanuele II which is a good 10 minutes walk from the apartment to the actual platform 5) The breakfast is 1.5 blocks away (once you find it - the name of the cafe is not on the ticket they give you so you have to look hard for the street numbers), you get 1 drink and a choice of pastry per person, however this seems to be open to interpretation as we had more than this on our last day without question - the food is fine though. 6) The bathroom is tiny and the shower especially small - my wife is 5ft 5inches and she found it too small for the fittings they have used. 7) The TV is limited in channels 1 English (BBC World News) a few in German and French everything else itallin, no CNN or pay movies (I realise this is not what you go to rome for, but if the weather turns bad it may be important to you) 8) There is no room safe 9) There are no drinks facilities in your room, and no kettle in the communal kitchen - very poor. 10) There is no mini bar (you do get an empty fridge though :-) 11) You cannot open your room window as it is too noisy and too much traffic fumes come into the room. (there is air-conditioning though) Positives: 1) You recieve a warm welcome on your arrival, they do their best to make you feel at home but not much that a decent guide book can't do really! 2) The room is clean 3) It is inexpensive - it is not cheap as you can get a room in a Hotel for the same price as this in a similar location, or pay a small amount extra \u20ac20-30 per night to be really central 4) The decor of the rooms is pleasant 5) The nearest Metro is only 10 minutes walk away - even if it is an unpleasant walk 6) The room has air-conditioning - absolutley essential in July 7) There is a TV in the room 8) There is an elevator to get you to the 3rd floor where the apartment is. In summary I would not recommend this to someone who needs more than 2-3 hours sleep per night, in the end that is what you are paying for, somewhere to sleep so when that fails you have to be honest with yourself. Just incase you are wondering I did try to find an alternative place after our first night as niether of us had slept well, but everywhere else was fully booked, so please think carefully.", "Date": "July 11, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "2", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Washington, DC", "Title": "\u201cKnow what to expect.\u201d", "Author": "Business_Traveller66", "ReviewID": "UR69761031", "Content": "We booked Cromata for our stay in Rome based on the Trip Advisor reviews. If you're planning on staying there, it's very important to know exactly what to expect and weigh against other alternatives. First of all and as its name states, Cromata is not a hotel; it is a converted 3-bedroom apartment on the third floor of a residential building. In addition to the rooms, there is a small office/kitchenette that could be used to lounge around. There is no reception or permanent staff on premises; if you need something and the owner is not there, you will have to call him (or his sister, they're both helpful). In general, this is more like staying in a friend's apartment than in a hotel. The rooms themselves are modern, including the renovated bathrooms. They have all the basic comforts but are very \"compact\". We really had to organize our stuff extremely well to avoid a total mess in the room. The bed was OK, plus there was a chair and a small desk with a mini fridge underneath it. There is a TV and free WiFi but no phone. The main problem, besides the size of the room, was the noise. The building faces a small street that has a lot of rush hour traffic and the acoustics of the street make it seem like the cars are right outside your window. The owner told me they were about to install soundproof windows, I would suggest you check with them if it's been done or not. Breakfast consists of 2 beverages and 1 pastry served in a cafe 3 blocks away. It's extremely basic and I got the impression that the cafe owners much prefer dealing with the local folk than with voucher-wielding hotel guests. They do however offer freshly squeezed blood orange juice, it's a treat. The neighborhood is a bit on the seedy side, not much to see except a local market two blocks away. You're better off walking 15 minutes to the Piazza Vittorio Emanuele II, which has some good eating places nearby. You can also walk to the Coliseum (about 25 minutes), and you're 10 minutes from the Termini metro and rail station. Before booking, you should decide whether you need the comforts of a full-service hotel in a nicer part of town, or if you're OK in a basic room in a not-so-nice part of the city (but conveniently located to move around). The hotel will certainly cost more, but it may be a worthwhile investment for some. We certainly missed some creature comforts; my wife had the flu when we arrived and we would have killed for room service. For us, and maybe for some of you, the additional expense of a hotel would have been worth it. If not, Cromata will probably do - just know what to expect.", "Date": "July 5, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Devon", "Title": "\u201cVery comfortable, fantastic service and well located\u201d", "Author": "DevonRoamer85", "ReviewID": "UR63709626", "Content": "Having spent a week in Rome staying at Cromata Rooms I would highly recommend this place, especially for couples.
