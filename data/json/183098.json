Some people complain about the location, but what I like about it is that you typically can't get a hotel of this calibre outside of a city's downtown core or airport. They have done a nice job with the renovations in the lobby level (although I wish there was a TV at the bar so that I'm not relegated to the annex (little room off the side of the bar with a few TV's). True -- some aspects of the room are a bit tired or dated, but it's still very clean and comfortable, and the rooms are among the most spacious in Toronto -- particularly the bathrooms. In terms of the local area, you've got quick access to the DVP and the 401, and there are lots of restaurants in the area -- a new pub across the road, a really cool area at the Shops at Don Mills, and plenty of other things in the neighbourhood. True, better if you have a car. But I work downtown, and I thought the bus service to Don Mills station and then the subway downtown was more than adequate, and no longer than driving down the DVP or bayview in traffic. All in all i like this place (although I miss the bar on the lower level), and I think it is good value for the product one receives. This hotel is rarely over $200, and most of the time you can get it for $160 or so.

The lobby of this property has been renovated and looks amazing, as do the restaurant and bar. The rooms themselves are a little bit outdated, but even with the rooms being a little bit dated, you still get an extremely comfortable bed, flat screen tv's, and nice washrooms. The staff overall is phenominal (with a couple exceptions). On the positive side, Tyson is always by the door, ready to greet you with a smile and make you feel welcome. Jennifer at the front desk goes above and beyond to ensure you feel like you are at home, and will do everything she can to make your stay enjoyable. The rest of the staff are very friendly, but these two in particular epitomize what hotel customer service should be, and truly are one of the main reasons I continue to stay at this hotel. On a recent stay, I had several issues, which I had to escalate in order to get resolved. Beware of dealing with Azar (spelling might be off). He is lacking in customer service skills, and makes no effort to understand a customers point of view. He is hostile and will not be of any use in attempting to resolve your issues. Fortunately, his superior, Kevin McFadden, I believe the Guest Service Manager, has been nothing short of amazing. Kevin takes the time to understand your viewpoint, and will do everything he can to resolve any issue. My only other negative experience with a staff member was with George, who delivered room service. We received a salad from room service that was horrible, and sent it back. He was extremely rude in taking it back, and muttered profanity under his breath. Aside from that salad, the food is very good. The business center is lacking a little bit, as they have 2 computers, only 1 hooked up to a printer, and they are extremely slow. I always travel with a computer, but I needed to print and use their computer for this, and it took 10 minutes for what should have taken 1 minute. The internet also seems to be a little bit slow On the bright side, they provide free wireless internet for Gold/Platinum members. Back to the positive, this hotel is a warm, comfortable place to stay, with staff second to none. I won't let 2 bad apples ruin the experience there, as all the other staff make up for the negatives of 2 people.

There are several restaurants and shops minutes from the hotel and a beautiful mall called \"Bayview Village\" less than a 10 minute drive away (there is an Indigo Bookstore, LCBO and lots of shops and several restaurants there). I actually like that it is away from the hustle and bustle from downtown and so close to the highway. With no traffic it is 25 minutes to the airport. The Westin Prince is situated on a beautiful, scenic plot of land (15 acres) with many trees and set back from the main street. This hotel has an \"old school\" feel to it and has been renovated extensively in the past 8 or so years. The lobby is elegant and sophisticated and gives the hotel a grand feel and the lobby bar is open and inviting. There is a Japanese restaurant called \"Katsura\" off the lobby that I did not go into. The outdoor pool area is quiet and surrounded by trees and is delightful to relax in (the pool itself is on the smaller size). There are tennis courts there as well as some sort of lawn bowling lanes. The gym is small but has all the necessary machines and weights to put in a decent workout. Seems like there is a lot of wasted space on the lowest level where the gym and pool area is. There is a little guest shop by the elevators with snacks, magazines and other things you need or would like for a short stay. This is the second time I stayed here and I requested a high floor with a view. I was given room 1108 which is a corner room facing Don Mills and the 401 and overlooking the pool, tennis courts, soccer field and some business buildings. There was a slight smell in the room (remedied by opening the sliding door which only opens 3 inches - I think this is ridiculous) and the carpet a little grungy. Mini fridge was well stocked. Nice big flat screen t.v. with great cable channels and movie selections. The room felt very business forward but was bright and airy and quiet despite being by the elevators. Nice, comfy king bed. Clean bathroom with nice amenities. Great room service menu, lots of selection and the \"late night\" and kids menu has fun selections. I ordered a salad and soup which were good but the salad was missing the apples and the bread was a little stale.

Ample parking but for a fee ($13 for overnight, self parking), good wi-fi ($9.95 for 24 hours). I paid $189 for the night. $1.00 per phone call for local calls plus .10 a minute thereafter (this is silly). I had an issue with the bathroom door which locked behind me. The initial maintenance call came about 15 minutes later but the door still could not be opened so I waited another 40 minutes before the second visit. As a result, I couldn't get fully ready for the event I had to go to and ended up having to leave the room while the maintenance staff was still there. When I got back, the doorknob was completely removed. There was no kind of amends made for the inconvenience.

I flew in from California specifically for this event. Towards the end of the night, as I was watching people on the dance floor, the waiters have started cleaning up the tables. The waiter cleaning the table next to me splattered red wine on my silk gown. Since this was a black tie event, I was wearing a designer gown worth $4000. I reported this incident that same night it happened to the night manager named Argon. He then reported it to Kevin McFadden, the customer service manager, who then contacted the banquet manager about the incident. Angel, the waiter who splattered the wine on me, did report the incident to his manager per Kevin's investigation. So, there's no question that the incident happened and it was their employee who was at fault. During the first week after the incident, I had telephone conversations with both Kevin McFadden and Azhar Kheraj, Kevin's assistant. They told me to get the dress cleaned and that we will discuss compensations after it has been established that the stain cannot be removed. Kevin never bothered to inform me that he was going to be on vacation starting the following week for 10 days. On August 9, I emailed Kevin and Azhar pictures of the dress with a note from the cleaner that the stain will not come out. I waited for a response from either of them but nobody bothered to respond. I called the hotel on Friday, August 12th and spoke with the front desk person. I left my contact number so that I may be called back and yet, no phone call again. On Saturday, August 13th I left a voicemail for both Azhar and Kevin and, guess what?, no response again. I finally spoke with Azhar on Tuesday, August 16th and only then was I informed that Kevin was on vacation for 10 days and that he will be back the next day. He told me that nothing can be done until Kevin comes back because he would have to make the ultimate decision on the matter. The next day, Azhar called me and said that there is no way they were gonna pay for my dress. He offered me a free one night stay with spa. I said that that's unacceptable because I'm not going to fly all the way to Toronto for that one night stay. So, I then contacted Sarah Pereira, executive assistant in the hotel. When I spoke with Sarah, I told her the situation and she said she was willing to work with me. I then receive an email from her a couple of days later and she gave me a deadline (10 days after the email) to submit a receipt for the dress. Of course, the dress was bought 3 months earlier and I didn't have the receipt. Furthermore, the dress was charged to my sister's credit card because she paid half of the dress as a birthday present for me. Also, I could not make the deadline because I'm due to leave the country for a couple of weeks and won't be back till 1 week after the deadline. So, a couple of days later, I called Sarah back and told her of the situation. She said she'll talk with somebody else and email me \"shortly\". Of course, I didn't get an email from her until after I emailed her late the next day for an update. Basically, she said that since I cannot provide the receipt within their deadline then the investigation is closed. I feel that the staff dragged this issue on unnecessarily. The fact of the matter is that thier waiter spilled wine on me and the stain cannot come out. Their waiter even admitted his fault. My dress is ruined. And with regards to Sarah, Kevin, and Azhar, none of them ever called or emailed back when they said they would. I had to keep on tracking them down which was very unprofessional of them. And, how is it okay for Kevin to go on vacation, not inform me, had me keep on calling the hotel waiting for an update and think it's okay? And now that it's my turn to go on vacation, I don't get the same courtesy from these people? Meanwhile, I let them know in advance of my situation. Doesn't seem right, does it? I have been a Starwood Preferred Guest Member for many years now. I have stayed at numerous Westin hotels in many cities. I must say, this hotel's customer service is abominable and that I have never been treated so disrespectfully.

We were considering staying downtown, but we thought it wouldn't be much of an inconvenience to stay a bit outside of downtown, and we sure are glad (read below). When we arrived at the Westin Prince, we immediately felt like valued customers. Although not an elite Starwood Preferred member, the front desk attendant upgraded us to a junior suite for our two night stay on a high floor with a partial-view of downtown. Every staff member we encountered genuinely cared about us and was very friendly and courteous , especially the valet attendants. When we got to our room, we couldn't have been more impressed for the price we were paying. The heavenly-beds were truly heavenly, and the bathroom was elaborately furnished. The breakfast was a bit pricey, but worth it. Otherwise there is a Tim Horton's right next door and a few other options within walking distance. What was surprisingly most convenient about the hotel was its accessibility to the city via the TTC, Toronto's efficient, clean, and safe public transit system. In fact, for all of the attractions we visited (Science Centre, CN Tower, Old Fort York, Hockey Hall of Fame, etc.) we never once pulled our car out of the lot. Instead we walked to the bus stop at the foot of the driveway, boarded a bus, and within minutes were at the York Mills subway stop down the road, which connected us to anywhere and everywhere in Toronto. If you're comfortable using public transit, I'd highly recommend using the TTC and leaving your car in the lot to avoid the horrendous traffic, extreme parking fares downtown, etc. Downsides of hotel: Parking and internet are not free. But if you do pay for the internet, at least it is fast. We'll definitely return when in Toronto to avoid the high prices downtown and relax in this fabulous hidden gem of a hotel.", "Date": "January 23, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Toronto, Canada", "Title": "\u201cOur Christmas Vacation\u201d", "Author": "jsingh89", "ReviewID": "UR91230570", "Content": "My boyfriend and I selected the Westin Prince Hotel to stay at from Dec. 25 - Dec.28 2010. We wanted to have easy access to the downtown core and other parts of the GTA. The Westin is located on York Mills Rd and Don Mills, central to the DVP and 401 Hwys. Traveling north on Don Mills Rd you can find easy access to Fairview Mall, while travelling south on Don Mills Rd you can find The Shops at Don Mills and other restaurants. The Hotel has a beautiful lobby, and two wonderful restaurants, (the Katsura and the 900), and features a live pianist for dinner services. We stayed in the Deluxe King Suite, our room to look was decent, the heavenly beds are very comfortable, the carpet on the floor was a beige gone dark do to use and wear, and the colours on the wall were of a darkish beige, as you can imagine we used the table lights in the room because of the poor choice in wall colour. The washroom had a nice sink fixture however the heavenly shower that Westin advertises was ridiculously small. It is not comfortable to be showering, only to move, and have your buttom brushing the wall or doors as you move. And believe me it's not your weight, it's the shower size, I only weigh 135 lbs! Here is a summary of what we experienced to be our Pro's and Con's Pro's 1. The room service staff and house keeping staff are very friendly and helpful 2. Our special requests - being in a corner room - we're met 3. Accessibility in terms of location and where we wanted to travel too was met 4.The hotel is clean throughout its different rooms and levels 5. For me this is a pro, for others it may not be, The entire hotel is a Smoke Free Zone Con's 1. You PAY for Parking - $11/per car/per night, we had two cars 2. You PAY for Internet Access - they provide you with bundled options; we paid $35 for 3 nights - you can go to a motel 6 and get free internet access! In this day and age paying for internet at a hotel is truly pathetic! not to mention the speed of the internet was very poor! 3. Shower size is way too small in order to shower comfortably, and no you cannot take a shower with your Hubby or Wife, the two of you will not fit! 4. Refreshment Bar - That automatically charges you when you lift a bottle to see what the heck it is - Yes, thats right. I picked up a bottle to see what flavour it was only to read the sign that states, If you lift anything your account will automatically be charged! - Service express took care of the issue for me as I did not consume a bottle of Vitamin water for $15 bucks 5. The hotel is too pricey- Anything in the refreshment centre, from what I remember was not below $7. Its not like there bonus size cans of pop or candy bars, they're regular size. If you really want a can of pop or candy bar go to the connivence store or the Longos thats located 2 minutes away from the hotel =) 6. The paint choice and carpeting we're very poor and did not add any ambience to the room. 7. The pool is seasonal, so it was closed, instead they had a very Tiny Whirlpool. 8. There is no Spa at this Hotel - Your only choice for relaxation at this hotel is via the heavenly bed, and small shower. All in all, The Westin Prince Hotel is Not a Hotel I willing be staying at in the near future. I have stayed in various hotels for travel and business, anywhere from a single king room in a Motel 6 to MGM's Sky Loft. The Westin Prince Hotel is supposed to be a hotel, amongst others, towards the luxurious end of the scale, for myself, that is show cased most importantly in the living quarters of the guest. Unfortunately from my experience, I did not experience luxury nor did I experience a room that projected a warm ambience. The beds we're comfortable for a good nights rest, however that did not make up for the lack of room and comfortableness missing in the washroom, the lack of a spa, and access to a pool. I hope this review helps individuals out there looking for thee perfect place to stay, because the Westin at Don Mills and York Mills is Not the one at all.

Why? It got me fired up with love and hate all at the same time (and I'm stuck in my hotel room waiting for a client to call me back =). Firstly, the great things: * This hotel has the best breakfast buffet I've ever experienced in my life. The cinnamon french toast I had on day 1 was so amazing I couldn't help but stuff myself silly with 2nds then 3rds! I also partook in some of their fresh-baked banana bread and, well, WOW. Amazing. The 2nd day I noticed that they had STRAWBERRY BANANA SMOOTHIES at the beverage area. Are you kidding me? I had two. Delicious! The orange juice was also delicious and was obviously NOT from concentrate (one of my hotel pet peeves is orange juice from concentrate--yuck!). Probably freshly squeezed. All you can eat delicious gourmet food for $14--not cheap but not too bad either. Think of it as a $10 buffet with $4 all-you-can-drink smoothies =) * The room: Pretty much par for the course except for the GIGANTIC LCD TV (nice) and their signature dual shower heads (which I tried and can't say it is worth the water waste but it *was* a neat feature). The mini snack bar is a bit scary... If you merely lift an item to look at it the thing will automatically charge your room (probably RFID-based). If I stayed here in the winter I'd be afraid of bumping the table when taking off my coat and winding up with $40 worth of snack charges. Now for the bad: * The room: With the exception of the halogen track lighting in the bathroom all lighting fixtures had old-school incandescent bulbs that were covered in so much dust they'd start to smell like, well, burning dust after a while. They have little cards everywhere talking about how they're trying to be \"green\" (don't use the extra shower head if you want to save water, don't put the card down to change the sheets, etc) then they have incandescent bulbs in all the fixtures!?! This just astounds me... The cheapest, quickest way to save a LOT of electricity is to switch to compact fluorescent bulbs. I haven't been to a hotel using old school energy-wasting bulbs in like 5 years now. Get with your own program Westin! The room #2: The door to the hallway was hollow and zero effort was taken to seal it in any way. This means you can hear every sound in the hallway as if you left your door open. I normally don't care about such things (most hotel goers are pretty quiet) but I could literally hear the sound of a person three doors down simply inserting their key card into the door (which is a nominally quiet action). The combination of hallways that amplify sound plus the non-existent soundproofing in/on/around the doors made for a very, er, intimate experience with the other hotel guests that were actually trying to be quiet. NOT COOL. Lastly... When I booked this hotel I got a corporate rate ($159) which is actually an amazing deal. However, the client had me move the check-in date forward one day and this resulted in a room price increase to $359/night! I didn't find out about this until the day I checked in at which point I complained and they \"corrected\" the rate. It all worked out for ME but I can't help but wonder how many travelers get completely screwed by such things. Westin needs to get a handle on their booking system to prevent things like this from happening in the first place.", "Date": "August 25, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Ottawa, Canada", "Title": "\u201cThis hotel is improving, our stay was (mostly) enjoyable\u201d", "Author": "COCOFromOttawa", "ReviewID": "UR74334797", "Content": "This is my second review of Toronto's Westin Prince, a unique hotel property north of Toronto's core set in quiet, park-like grounds. Our family stays at The Prince regularly and, as I mentioned in my review last year, the hotel has been plagued by problems associated with recent extensive renovations and significant issues related to the abilities of a small minority of its staff. I'm happy to report that the renovations are progressing well and the lobby and public areas are updated and spacious. Hotel rooms, including ours, have not all been refreshed but ours was comfortable, spacious and well air conditioned. Hotel staff were super-friendly and helpful (only exceptions were our bored-to-bits-check-in-clerk and the obnoxious doorman who shouted at my husband for not using the revolving door and then for not using it properly). The horrible \"automatic\" magnetic trays with jars of candies in every room are really annoying -- this time my son grabbed a jar of \"free\" gummy bears before I could stop him -- but the front desk agreed to take them off our bill when we brought it to their attention - we didnt have to fight to have this done this like last year.

Staff at the check in desk were always pleasant, helpful and efficient, doubling much of the time as the concierge desk too. However the information on arrival that self-parking (and one really needs a car to stay here) in the huge lot that surrounds this suburban hotel was charged at $11/day, and that room wi-fi connection was an additional $9.95/day, both plus the high Canadian tax, left us wondering what else would be extra. Notices in the bedroom warn that if you touch anything in the mini bar it will automatically register a charge, and that the refrigerator should not be used for personal items. However separately there are glasses and a 750ml bottle of water, and an invitation to \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcrevitalise\u00e2\u20ac\u2122. A nice gesture of welcome? No way! In tiny print at the end of the label I read that the water would be charged at $5.95. There are two paper cups, two tea bags and three individual coffee bags provided for guest use \u00e2\u20ac\u201c but beware, they come with a warning that additional supplies requested will be charged! The hotel has pleasant, spacious public areas, and has a gym, outdoor pool and hot tub. Our room in the tower was large, clean and comfortable. A note from management on the desk welcomed us to Spring in Toronto (it was August). The bed was large, and the room also has one armchair, a desk (but no writing paper), a flat screen TV, adequate drawer and wardrobe space and an iron and ironing board. The bathroom was small, but adequate, and a good hairdryer, one robe and a retractable clothes line are provided. A french window opens onto a narrow balcony, which allows fresh air into the room. Pity that the management has not considered using the balcony to access the outside of the windows to clean them! Inviting us to \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcsave the planet\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 the hotel offers a $5 voucher to spend in the hotel if one declines to have any housekeeping. Many hotels have ways in which guests can indicate that they do not want bedlinens or towels changed, but can still have the bedroom and bathroom cleaned and tidied, beds made, wastebaskets emptied and supplies replenished. This was not an option at the Westin, and maybe I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m wrong, but I couldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t help feeling that the aim was to save the hotel costs rather than help the planet. Breakfast in the restaurant was good, and good value, but again the hotel let itself down by penny pinching. When my husband questioned whether or not the orange juice was fresh as indicated on the menu, the waiter admitted that it was not, although it had been in the past. Dinner was not so good, but there are many restaurants in the immediate vicinity offering similar food at competitive prices. This could be a really good hotel and really good value.

This hotel is about ~30 - 45 minute drive on a commuter congested highway to downtown and you will need to rent a car (unless you have a hefty taxi cab budget).

They relaxed cancellation rules and check-out times due to the special circumstances (volcano) and even though they were pretty fully booked for the following few days they did find us space on a provisional basis since we did not know when we would be able to leave.

The location is good, depending on what you're after. Just a couple of minutes away from the junction of the 401 and Don Valley Pkwy. Downtown is about 15-20 minutes away with free-flowing traffic.

This is why we chose this hotel, and we weren't disappointed. The room itself was ok... nothing special. Nice TV if that's important to you... large, new plasma/LCD screen. The bathroom, however, is old and tired. Peeling wallpaper and some chips out of the vanity. Really, who cares, though, right? It's a bathroom and it seemed to be clean. The big issue I had was with lighting in there. There was a small, dim light over the vanity, and no light in the shower at all. Something should be done about that. The room had a balcony overlooking their back courtyard and the surrounding suburban / office park area. The balcony appeared to be falling apart... cracked plaster, weeds growing out of the slab, peeling paint, there was a discarded cigarette butt out there... and the sliding access door was nearly immovable, and I'm a pretty big guy. Maybe they're trying to discourage people from seeing the mess their balconies are. The common areas of the hotel (i.e., lobby and meeting room area) are tastefully decorated and well kept. We didn't eat in the restaurant or use any of the recreational facilities, so I can't comment on those, although the tennis court looked to be in decent shape. There's a small work area at the side of the lobby where you can plug in your laptop and sit down. One odd and moderately irritating thing was that the music piped into the lobby was club music... like house/techno/dance stuff.

I always return thinking that finally, this will be the stay where the irritating wrinkles get ironed out and I will return home to write a glowing review. Sadly, the wrinkles persist. On the good side: the hotel is being renovated and the public spaces are lovely, open and modern. There's free internet access in the lobby. The Westin beds are always comfortable, bathrooms modern and the rooms super clean and mostly quiet. The park setting, outdoor pool (in summer), tennis courts and shuffle board give the hotel the feel of a resort and make it a great place to stay with kids. The Westin Workout gym is equipped to a very high standard (with cardio equipment, a BOSU, exercise balls and a variety of weights) and the Super Foods Breakfast menu offers lots of healthy choices (and not so healthy ones too!) . On the bad side: cranky and even beligerent staff members scattered randomly throughout the hotel staff cancel out the great impression left by the many friendly and competent staff members. The gym and pool area are consistently not cleaned and often not stocked with towels. The gym is often out of cleaning spray to clean equipment which can get pretty gross. Many rooms have not yet been renovated and are showing signs of extreme wear and tear. A new \"automated\" mini bar and room snacks system charges you for products, even if you just touch them or pick them up: a nightmare for parents of kids who are attracted to the shiny boxes of candies and other snacks. Dont request a pool towel, a kettle for your room or ask to have the shiny room snack display moved or turned off unless you're prepared for some unpleasantness from those cranky staff members I mentioned.

On the long weekend that we visited, the hotel was very quiet, which may explain why we were able to find such a favorable rate. Our second floor room had no view to appreciate, but it was extremely roomy and pleasantly decorated. It had a \"heavenly\" king bed and a work area that I would really have appreciated if I had been there on business. Not wanting to pay for Internet access, I was easily able to use the computer in the hotel business center. The $15+ charge for continental breakfast drove us away from the hotel restaurants, but there are a number of (mostly fast-food) restaurants within walking distance of the hotel, including several that deliver. In addition to a nice outdoor pool, there is a tennis court and a very nice workout room. We found the staff we dealt with to be very courteous. The only problem we had was a slow response to our request for the room to be serviced. A call to the housekeeping manager resolved this.

My coming back here for the second time in one month (I live in Toronto and about 15 minutes away from the hotel) implies great service, excellent amenities, cleanliness, friendly and helpful staff and the \"ever-so-crucial\" pet policy. The rooms are spacious, the beds really ARE heavenly, and the staff really does deserve the praise other guests have given them. The only less-than-perfect aspect of the stay is the washroom. Though the rooms have been renovated and are flawless, the bathroom seems to have been left the same for the last 30 years. The dated design isn't the downfall, it's the shower that's mounted so low, only people under 5'6 can comfortably use it, the bath itself shows significant wear and tear and the fixtures date back to before I was born. The first time I stayed, there was mold in the crevices of the shower, though it seems to have been scrubbed off. I did take a picture to present to you, my fellow trip advisor users, but it hardly seems fair to post the monstrous image since the issue has been resolved. The check in seems to be speedy for most. I can't give an objective opinion, as issues with my credit card company (sigh!) have come up both of the times I have checked in, resulting in a painfully long check in time. Though the concierge/valet was only too happy to look after my dog (she was waiting in an air conditioned car, as I didn't want her waiting/bouncing around during the check in process). All of the staff are very accomodating and a true pleasure to interact with. The check out was seamless, as they have a quick check out program and I was able to accomplish this within minutes, even with a large dog pulling me in every direction:). Now, for the pet policy. Upon our first arrival, my dog was greeted with a \"heavenly\" doggy bed, a set of bowls (they forgot this time, but we had it brought up to the room promptly....just missing one if the bowls) and a little bag the contents of which are too cute for words. There are two plastic capsules with doggy \"potty\" bags and a pair of plastic gloves! The was also a small paper tag to put on your pet's collar with the hotel name on it. The area surrounding the hotel provides for a scenic and pleasant walk with plently of bushes to smell and green grass to snack on.

While the Westin Prince is not located downtown, it is conveniently located right by a bus stop (95) which takes you into the York Mills Station where you can take the train downtown. The hotel is contemporary and the lobby area is very nice. Upon our arrival, we were interested in finding hockey tickets. The woman who checked us in happily took the information and said she would look for tickets and call us in our room. That was a good way to start our stay! Hannah was very sweet and helpful. Unfortunately, there were no tickets available but she did try. My husband was not happy with the odor in the first room we were in (it wasn't smoke, I can't describe it) and Hannah moved us to another room. She even sent the new room keys up to us. The second room was much better. Our only criticism is that the rooms are fairly nice but the carpets are stained and bubbled. My husband is a carpet installer and had he had his tools with him, he would have fixed all of the bubbles. The carpet did take away from the room and we are not too picky. There is no reason to have what look liked bleach stains on the carpet. I read that there will be a renovation this year (the elevators will also be renovated). The shower was the best part. We both indulged and used the double showerhead. Try it, you won't use one showerhead anymore! The bed was comfortable but the pillows were just okay. There is a nice sized tv in the room but programming is limited compared to what we are used to. The restaurant in the lobby is great. We ate dinner at Seasons on our night of arrival. It was a bit pricey (we are not used to the multiple taxes, as well) but it was worth it. We ate there for breakfast each morning. I ordered off the menu (I recommend that granola pancakes) and my husband had the buffet twice, which was full of pastries, bagels, cold cuts, cheeses, an omelette station, pancakes--food galore. There are several restaurants located directly across from the hotel on the other side of York Mills. There was Kelsey's (we ate there and recommend), pizza, a greek place, Starbucks and Shoeless Joe's. Staff always tidied the room and respected the \"peace\" sign on the door. Our original sheets had a small hole on my side and a few days later I requested a linen change and there was a small hole on that set of sheets. Very odd! Amenities were provided-shampoo, conditioner, body lotion and even mouthwash. Nice white tea smell. There was a computer for use on the main floor. There should be a sign posted that if people are waiting to use it that there is a limit. Sometimes people need to be reminded of manners. While many people would probably pay for a taxi to get around, it is expensive and the transit system is really easy to use. There is a mall about 10 minutes away that has a new cinema with stadium seating. I do not recommend the Japanese restaurant located right by the hotel. They are really overpriced and most items were a la carte. Soup and salad is typically included in all Japanese restaurants that I have eaten in. There were 2 prix fixe options which were equally expensive ($68 or $110).

There were 3 phones in the room (1 in the bathroom), and multiple lines... we didn't get to explore what's there. I would've hoped that they don't charge for wireless internet. Even Best Westerns or Comfort Inns offer free wireless internet, I don't understand why Westin hotel can't throw that in with the price they charge for a room. And we did have to pay for parking at $11 a day. It's not so uncommon in a big city like Toronto. But we were very happy with the stay.", "Date": "August 21, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "2", "Check in / front desk": "2", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Vancouver, BC", "Title": "\u201c3 star at best, needs renovation\u201d", "Author": "PWW090", "ReviewID": "UR7927003", "Content": "Stayed at the Westin Prince in June on business. Just a little intro - I normally stay in 4-5 * places and have traveled extensively. I am quite fine staying in a Hampton or Best Western for the value, but when I pay top dollar, I do expect a lot. In the case of this Westin, I got very average. I have stayed in other 4 diamond properties many times and this hotel is simply not up to par. They have not renovated for many years and it is definitely due. Rooms were ok, furniture from Ikea. They did give me a decent upgrade (SPG Gold), so I assume this is a nicer room than average. If you need to be in this area, I guess this is the place to stay. But try to get a great deal, because after your stay, you will definitely think you paid too much if it was more than $150 or so.", "Date": "June 18, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "3", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "1", "Check in / front desk": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Niagara", "Title": "\u201cWosrt Westin Experience Thus Far\u201d", "Author": "cabbage86", "ReviewID": "UR7845024", "Content": "Upon arrival, there was no doorman who greeted us. We entered the hotel to find the front desk, where the staff member looked like he just rolled out of bed, not impressed. i asked where the ATM was and he pointed to where the phones were, but the ATM had been moved, he didnt realize this at first, and when i asked the concierge he had no idea. after finding the ATM, which was across from the business centre, I asked to use a computer for only a few seconds to do an online bank transfer. the RUDE attendant in the business centre said that I was unable to use a computer because she was leaving...definetly not expected. throughout our stay were were not offered if there was anything else that they could do, or even if we enjoyed our stay. we were not recognized as SPG members, we called down to the service desk for extra bath amenities, which they delivered 50% of what we asked for, when we called back down, the phone attendant said that she \"will just have to call her again\", making it seem as if it was a big hassle. directions from the westin site took us down don mills road into the korean business district infront of a house...so it took us an hour extra to get to the hotel. There was no apology offered or sense of empathy, simply an \"Oh, i guess someone is not doing their job!\". So now they just pass the blame to the higher of their associates???? Over all this hotel has some work do to in terms of learning what 4 star customer service entails. Our whole experience was awful and we were recognized as nothing more than a room number walking in then out the front doors. I would not recommend this hotel to anyone who is a person and likes to be treated like one...there are nice westins out there that i have experienced...I would just NEVER stay at this one again simply because of the service, facilities were nice, but service turned me right off", "Date": "June 13, 2007"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "The Westin Prince Toronto", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g155019-d183098-Reviews-The_Westin_Prince_Toronto-Toronto_Ontario.html", "Price": "$140 - $215*", "Address": "<address> <span rel=\"v:address\"> <span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">900 York Mills Road</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:locality\">Toronto</span>, <span property=\"v:region\">Ontario</span> <span property=\"v:postal-code\">M3B 3H2</span></span>, <span class=\"country-name\" property=\"v:country-name\">Canada</span> </span> </span> </address>", "HotelID": "183098", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/02/51/ee/44/lobby-fireplace.jpg"}}
