They have a bad relationship with their \"free breakfast\" partner cafe on site, a historical restaurant called DuPar's. Here's what went wrong during our stay with 2 kids and a small dog. I have a one word recommendation for anyone traveling with a family: DON'T. For others interested in a casual hotel stay and plan to spend most of the time outside, the hotel is in a central location with lots of amenities and attractions nearby. But the neighborhood is dumpy, at best. 1. Upon arrival, I was given 2 breakfast vouchers. I reminded them we're a family of FOUR, and they knew that, because I'd booked a kids' suite. They tried to charge me $7/each kid's voucher. When I complained, a kind lady stepped in and ordered the clerk to give them to me anyway. Also, I was promised bunk beds for the kids, but got a pull-out style bed instead. Not a big deal, as my kids are old enough to manage a pull-out bed themselves. I just don't like the switch-and-bait attitude. 2. A security guard got into an argument with a man that was supposedly smoking pot outside our building, bldg A. He got onto a walkie-talkie and complained to someone about him, probably the police. This was when I was walking right by with my kids. I didn't feel safe there after that. 3. There were TOO FEW garbage cans around the complex. The one behind bldg. A, that faces the Vons, was ALWAYS full and overflowing. The grass strip there was full of dog poop. There were no dog poop bags available, even though the hotel allows dogs. 4. DuPar's is clearly not happy with the voucher arrangement with Wyndhams. The free breakfast is very restricted, and they allow NO substitutions (unless you make friends with the staff at DuPar's first). They tried to nickle-and-dime us for every little thing we ordered \"off the menu\", like pancakes. Even when our kids weren't hungry and are small eaters and didn't want to order the free breakfast, which is too much food for them, and when we had free vouchers. 4.5: The GOOD thing about the breakfast arrangement is that you can get it anytime, so long as the place is open: 6am to 10pm or so. 5. I asked for a wine bottle opener at the front desk. They couldn't find one and asked me to ask at DuPar's. They refused to open it, saying they'd \"already given a bottle opener to the Wyndham front desk\"! I couldn't believe I was dealing with adults at this point. I had to purchase a wine opener from the gift shop that night. 6. DuPar's refused to give us coffee \"to go\", even though I had vouchers. 7. Tiny parking spots. We had a Honda Pilot and it was a struggle. 8. Internet access was free, easy and worked fine. 9. Air conditioning worked, but it was very loud. 10. My kids said the pool was cold, even though it is supposed to be outdoor/heated. Granted, we were there when it was always overcast and foggy. I will NEVER stay with Wyndham again. It is clearly a very badly managed hotel company.", "Date": "April 27, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "2", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Sleep Quality": "1", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "San Diego", "Title": "\u201cSTAY AWAY...SKIP DUMP....DANGEROUS FOR CHILDREN\u201d", "Author": "FW507", "ReviewID": "UR128641737", "Content": "Not what I expected from a Wyndham....Parking is very tight & you might have to walk a good distance from a parking space to your room.

The bed was the most uncomfortable bed I've ever slept in...after 2 of my 6 night stay my lower back hurt. Especially unexpected was a hidden danger from the king bed!! There was a narrow walkway on between the wall and bed. Two ragged, sharp steel support bars jutted from under the bed 3 inches past the pedestal and mattress! The bed skirt hid these bars and I unexpectedly slammed my shin into one of them....Left a painful puncture & gash on my shin! I walked with a limp for several days after this incident.

One room had a couch (most likely a pullout but didnt check) and a nice area with tv, fridge, micro and coffee items for the morning. The two things I will mention is the tv channels did not match the list so they should work on that, and they only gave 1 packet of coffee so ask for an extra if you will want it before bed. The 2nd room had another tv, 2 full beds and the sink area and the toilet and shower were off this room. There is a fan in here which did make it nice for sleeping, while a little noisy if you are used to quiet, the fan kept it plenty cool. What I will say is there is not a hair dryer in the room and only 2 \"big\" towels. On this, I would also ask before going to bed as it took us quite awhile to get those in the am. The room was very clean, the people at the front counter were nice and the only problem I had was a grouchy gal in the gift shop. Definately good bang for the buck. We did not go to the pool the restaurant next door so I cannot comment on those. We did have dinner at Olive Garden a couple blocks away, and there were many food options close by.

On the first stay we attempted to check in at 12:00 and were turned away saying that check in was at 3:00 without exception (the empty lot made me believe that there may have been a room available). My family and I returned at 3:00 to face a 40 minute wait in line to check in. The room was fine and very clean. The next morning we went to the attached restaurant \"Du-Pars\" and were faced with a $50.00 bill for breakfast (basic eggs, toast, coffee & juice) for 2 adults and 2 children. In my opinion it was way overpriced, but depends on the person. Our second stay we checked in late just to avoid the lines. The counter staff person checked me in and gave me a map to my room. I followed the map, got my family out of the car, got all of the luggage, lugged it up to the second floor and wandered around the building looking for the room number, which did not exist. After dragging everything back to the car I returned to the office. After informing the same person that the room did not exist, she said \"oh, sorry about that, wrong building\". Thats it! When I got to the room I found that the sink did not drain, the door to the bathroom did not close or lock and the curtain between the rooms was missing (important for putting the kids down to sleep).

We thought we researched the hotel well, enough doing our due diligence with the photos/Wyndham website and reputation. The photo in the website is completely misleading, as it has been shot at an angle to make it appear to be overlooking a beautiful pool. The pool is actually quite small, and is nestled up to a restaurant, not the hotel. Sadly, we didn't read Tripadvisor first (those of you who are reading this---be glad you did, so you won't have any surprises). As others have stated, the hotel is near Sea World, and is in a more \"industrial\" part of town. There are several buildings in the complex, making for difficult driving/parking. Very difficult parking.... The room was clean (good), but small--so much so, that it was difficult to open the bathroom door because the bed was in the way. The telephone in the \"bedroom\" was not connected. There was no cord, nothing! (This was discovered when I attempted to call another room. Naturally, my thought at that discovery was \"OMG--what if we had had an emergency in the middle of the night?). But the phone in the \"livingroom\" was no better---it did have a cord, and was plugged into the wall, but had no dialtone. Hence---no working phone at all in the room..... The pillows were small, lumpy and extremely uncomfortable for sleeping. Then, as we were leaving the following morning, we saw several had been tossed on the floor at the outside door while the room was being made up. Not a comforting site or thought--that we had probably been sleeping on pillows that had been on the ground. All in all I would just advise---don't expect too much.

I will never stay in any Wyndham Hotel again. I read the review about the bed bugs and I am horrified because I have two bites on my back and my husband and I have joked that they probably have bedbugs. I was offered a refund but it is sad that if this is what you call a newly remodeled hotel I would be afraid to see it before the remodeling. Our friends also had a suite and it had a hole in the wall that was supposed to bring the airconditioning from the front room to the bedroom and it was an empty hole!!!! I can't believe that a room could be rented like that. Their kids froze and parents baked! Not to mention their beds were also made with sheets only and no blankets. Only blankets were the polyester bed spreads unless you want to go to their lobby and wait in the long line and get a blanket. This is my letters to them! Our stay at the wyndham was terrible. I was so disappointed that Windham would put their name on a such a horrible place. Making reservations were horrible. Four messages to two people before we got a call back. Then we never received a confirmation and it took two weeks and a 30 minute phone call to get the confirmation sent to us. When called ahead to let them know that we were having a late arrival for our room. We were put in a wrong room and my husband and kids had to sleep in separate rooms. it took until 12:30 to get a room and he arrived at 11pm. That night he was woken up in the middle of the night because of a homeless man in the parking lot that pulled a knife on one of the fathers in the parking lot. He was up making a police report to the police. He woke up in the morning and waited in the line at the front desk and spent almost two hours straightening up the room issue. I arrived that morning to the confusion and had to miss my sons game and finish the room issue. We paid 300 a kid to play in the SanDiego World Series and I had to miss my sons first game because of Wyndhams mistake. I was given a key to our new room and my husband rushed my son to the game without me. When I arrived in the new room, I unpacked my suitcases and food into the refrigerator. Our stuff from the previous night was told that it would be brought to our new room. I waited and called the front desk and the manager came up and said your stuff is in another room. You are in the wrong room. I had to repack my stuff and carry it all to the new room! Food and all the stuff we had for the week. The manager was very nice and sent nuts and and water up to our room as an apology. We were also very disappointed in the TV reception. The TV's were from 20 years ago and they only got a few channels with good reception. My sister was due to arrive and I apologized to her and told her I was embarrassed by the hotel and that it was not very nice. The lady at the desk told me she would make sure that we would get better TV's and flat screens so that my kids could play their video games at night. The pools were packed with kids and at one point there was about 20 kids in the jacuzzi. At night there was no parking and we were told to park in the red zones and the hotel would make sure that we would not receive tickets! I wondered what if the fire department tried to get in for a fire! It would have been a disaster if they would have had a emergency and needed to get a fire truck through there. When I went to put my kids to bed our beds had one sheet only and then the polyester bed spred. No Blankets!!! The sofa bed had a sheet and no covers!!! I covered my kids with towels. In the morning I asked for more towels and they said they were in the dryer!! Wyndham suites was out of towels! Are you kidding me!!!! When my sister arrived she got in her room and we turned on the TV. No flat screen like we asked for and guess what?? The TV was broken. We had to ask for the matinence man to fix it at 11 PM. It was becoming a joke with us. Friday night I started my wash in the launder mat at the hotel. I waited in the usual long line at the front desk to get quarters and then waited for my washer and put my clothes in. We wanted to stay at Wyndham for the baseball tournament so we could wash thier uniforms. When my wash cycle was over, I opened the lid and my clothes were sitting in soapy water. Guess what, the washer broke!!! I went to the front desk again, waited in the line again and told the lady I was about to cry. I was up until 2am waiting for a washer to come available and washing and drying my clothes to be done for the 7 am game. There was a young girl in the laundry room that told me her refrigerator was broken in their room and their stove was not even connected to the wall. Another family was attacked by ants in their suite. My sister checked out a day late because she did not like it and I felt so bad that I booked her in such a terrible hotel. We felt like we were at the motel 6 not the Wyndham Suites. So from the booking to our friend being attacked in the parking lot at knife point and broken appliances, no towels or blankets on the beds, I will never stay at a Wyndham hotel again. We always book at Homewood Suites and I am always happy with them. I gave a copy of this to to manager and let her know that I would be contacting you. Our room was discounted to 99 a night for the inconvenience and we were allowed an early check out because I would not wait to go home and get in my nice sheets and beds made with blankets and not some polyester bedspread. I truly hope that you make a visit to Wyndham Garden in Scan Diego and see that you need to know who represents the Wyndham name. I am also going to send this to some hotel reviews and to the Extreme Diamond Baseball that recommended you to our team. This was sent today: I just sent you my letter to Wyndham. As I spoke with one of my friends that stayed I am more amazed at the quality of your hotel. The ***** family had a suite with no fan to carry the air to the adult in the bedroom and the kids had to freeze in the sofa room and they too had beds made with no blankets. She too waited over 12 hours for towels and had to wait in line and insist on blankets. I am amazed at the service and as a manager I can't believe that your staff would rent a room with a hole in the wall and no fan. It can be fixed in 30 minutes but obviously your owner does not want to pay to fix his appliences and put in decent tv's that get more than 3 decent channels. Our team was told that they had to pay 300 dollars to opt out of staying in your hotel. I have not spoken with any other families except the *********** family because ********* was in charge of picking our hotel and she is our team mom. We tried to enjoy our trip and not ruin any of our friends stay because of our unhappiness. I feel badly for her that she had to feel responsible for our dissatisfaction. I read the Acuff's family letter and she praised the maids for making their stay good. Shows what a nice woman she is. I feel the maids should have made the beds properly and should have put more than 3 bath towels in the family suite but I am thinking they just do what they are told to do.

Signage sucks and if you miss your turn it is painful. About the Hotel...no it is a motel only in this part of San Diego but no one tells you this. We arrived late Sunday night after 8 hrs on the road. The room had ants, was loud, and beds were too soft for my liking. My wife spoke with Mgmt and we were moved across the property and upgraded to a \"Suite\". Didn't know that there was some major baseball tournaments so quiet was not a reality. The suite was helpful for a 4 night stay given we brought a small dog. It gave us room to spread out a bit and didn't cramp with a pet. We had a few times where we left the pet in the room in her crate so housekeeping could do their thing. Housekeeping was nice and helpful during the entire trip as was the balance of the staff. The two biggest issues I had were the ultra narrow parking spots and the lack of channels on tv when we were resting between activities. Best items were the restaurants. Next to the motel we had a 24 hr restaurant that had one of the best CFC w/eggs I have ever had! Plus the muffins were monsters in size and taste. A little pricey but quality was there. The best BBQ in San Diego is across the street at Phil's. Try the Beef Rib and Chicken combo it was awesome and cost effective. The Onion rings were the size of my fist and those were the small ones. A few minutes away in OB you have Azucar which is a bakery/coffee shop that was one of the best places we visited once we learned about it. 4 days and 3 visits if that tells you anything plus stocking up the day we left. Really close to OB and Mission with both being less than 10 minutes away with lights. Would I stay again yes I would but given the ultra soft beds, noise, and a flaky elevator I can't rate it higher than a 3. If a true Hotel is your need then stay downtown.

They had security in the parking lot, so I felt safe. The beds were comfortable, the 2 televisions in our junior suite were nice. Although it was a junior suite, it was very small. The air conditioner was rattling, but it would stop if we giggled it. The room with the pull out sofa stayed very cool, but the room with the beds did not have its own ac unit. There was a fan in the wall between the two rooms that helped, but there was still a significant temperature difference. The newer towels were very soft, though the older ones were rough. However, it seems strange that with a room set up for 6 guests, housekeeping kept leaving only 3 towels so we had to keep asking for more. they also did not include a blanket for the pullout. My kids had their own blankets so it was ok, but they were in the coldest room and an additional blanket would have been nice. The hotel shampoo and lotion were by Bath and Body works, so they were nice. Also, we called on the 1st day to say our bath drain was clogged, but I had to call again and it was finally cleared on the 3rd day. Although there has been a lot of work put in for renovation, the sidewalks are very dirty and stained. It's like walking into a renovated kitchen with a filthy floor. Power washing or restaining the walkways would make a big difference. We tried the restaurant and bakery for pastries, and found it expensive and not very fresh. Instead, we went to Von's behind the hotel and got fresh and delicious bagels and donuts for about .75 each.

I expected it to be like the one in Palm Springs, what a HUGE disappointment. This is not a Hotel, its a Motel.. Not very clean either.. The only thing I can honestly say about this place, is the people who work there.. So very nice and helpful.. I think the lady that helped us was Jenna and she was awesome. I seen how they were taking pictures of the hotel to make it look like its something wonderful, they stand on a table and it makes everything look so big and beautiful in fact, small and blah.. Has to be the smallest pool I have ever seen.. Will never stay again..
