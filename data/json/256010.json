The space, accommodations and bathroom were really beautiful and very traditional. Our second time to Venice we stayed for 7 nights in a beautiful room facing the Grand Canal. What an amazing experience. The hotel is only a very very short walk to the vaparetto and about a ten minute walk to Piazza San Marco (once you discover the best route!). The hotel's staff could not be more gracious - especially the front desk staff. Each evening on our return, we would have a glass of Prosecco at the hotel bar while gazing out on the canal. The hotel is very, very clean. Breakfast is plentiful and the service is very good. We dream of returning and exploring Venice further.

The room was cleaned well each day. Some reviews here say the breakfast is not up to scratch, but I really do think the hotel has taken these comments on board and improved this.

When I booked the suite I did not realize the \"balcony\" was only a \"step out\" and not a sittable balcony. It is step out type that is common in Venice. Although it was deltightful to stand on the balcony at night and observe the activity on the Grand Canal, I am not sure I would pay the added cost for this particular suite again. The entry level of the hotel had a few tables and chairs that also permitted enjoyable viewing of the Grand Canal. We would definitely stay at this hotel again if re-visiting Venice, but would probably opt for a less expensive room. The hotel arranged private transfers from cruise port to hotel and from hotel to airport. These transfers were a combination of private water taxi and limo.

Each room was very clean, lavishly furnished in classic Italian style, and felt luxurious. Beds were comfy & everyone slept well. The common areas were beautifully furnished and sparkling clean. Service was always very professional and courteous. We were traveling with my 80 year old father with limited mobility, and the desk staff arranged for a wheelchair rental and wheelchair assistance at the train station. The staff emailed me several times in advance to keep me updated on availability and cost of the rental, and provided a confirmation number for assistance at the train station. I should add, this was a rather last minute request 2 days prior to arrival. Upon our arrival, the wheelchair was waiting and it made all the difference in my father's ability to experience Venice. The location is great, close to good restaurants and easy walking distance to Rialto and Piazza San Marco. For us, having the convenience of a water bus stop next to the hotel was a huge plus. Not to mention the private water taxi dock at the hotel door step.

Bathrooms differ in size, but all of them are quite spacious and decorated nicely. The water pressure is not consistent thought, so while taking a shower you have to adjust hot/cold from time to time. We stayed there with kids in 2 interconnecting rooms. The bigger one had a very big bathroom and and alcove where a 3rd bed was placed. The smaller one was adequate enough, the only drawback being lack of wardrobe - just open space in the corridor with hanger rails and shelves. Though I didn't find this as a problem. 5 years ago we stayed in the Junior suite overlooking Canal Grande, I highly recommend it! Minuses: breakfast is pretty simple, choice is quite limited. The waitresses that particular morning were a bit slow and not extremely polite. However, maybe we just got unlucky with the shift....

The room was so lovely that I didn't mind overly much staying in there bed bound for almost a day and a half from being sick. (to that note, it was worth noting it costs 150 to call the hotel's doctor, so I decided to stick with a packet of imodium). One thing that we didn't like overly much was they didn't do a dinner service, and that there was no soup (only sandwiches, burgers and salads) on their room service menu, so I had to venture out of the hotel to a restaurant when I was ill. The area was really quiet at night, although Venice isn't really the place for drunken revelry. It only takes 3 minutes to walk to a lovely square for dinner (there is a SUPERB fish restaurant there, with a really nice propriertor.

I was particularly worried about hotels in Venice. I had heard that hotel rooms are very small, tend to be dark and sometimes smell musty because of the canal. This was not the case with Palazzo Sant'Angelo. I had a suite facing the canal with a view that was spectacular. The room was very comfortable, impeccably clean and amazingly large. The only thing that you need to be aware of is that they don't provide irons. I found this to be true of most hotels in Italy which is a bit frustrating. The hotels told me it was because they are fire hazzards but were more than willing to press things for you for a sizable fee. I think it's just another way for Italian hotels to generate more revenue. The hotel provides a very nice breakfast, not just croissants and coffee. They offered different types of bread, cold cuts, cheeses, cereals, yogurt, fruit, eggs, bacon, pastries, juices, coffee and tea. Their small dining room is very quaint, charming and tastefully appointed. They also have a small bar facing the canal that has appetizers during happy hour. There are several restaurants very close to the hotel although I was not impressed with the food in Venice. I had often heard that they had amazing sea food. While I loved Venice, I have had much better sea food in the states.......and much more reasonable as well. The location of this hotel is very convenient. It's only a few stops from the train station. 6.50 Euros per person on a Vaporetto or 120 Euros for a private water taxi. If you opt to take the Vaporettos, try to get into Venice as early as possible. I can't stress this enough. The Vaporettos become so crowded and it's difficult to get out of them (let alone with luggage) because of the number of people in them. We actually got stuck because we could not get to the exit fast enough and had to travel to the next stop and return. If it's one thing you learn traveling on these Vaporettos is that you have to be pushy!

We were upgraded to a beautiful suite so I can't really comment on the value of the room we had reserved but the suite was fantastic. My only complaint about the place is the bar - it's such a terribly poor decision to gouge customers for a cocktail as much as they do. So we ended up buying one drink during our stay and buying a bottle of gin from a store a five minutes walk away. I mean it was nearly $20 US for a gin and tonic which is completely outlandish and in fact quite off putting. As such, there was rarely anyone sitting in their bar - a nice space gone to waste because of rip off prices. The breakfast was great by the way and they make a nice latte. I would definately stay here again. We took the complimentary water taxi ride over to a glass factory tour which was worth doing - some beautiful works that you will not see in the shops. They pick you up at the hotel but drop you off at St Mark's.

We chose the hotel based on the recommendation of a friend who had invited us to a party to view the races from her roof terrace nearby. We were delighted with our choice. The hotel is not cheap - by Swiss standards it is quite pricey for a 4 star, but then this is Venice (!) and its location right on the Grand Canal is wonderful. I reserved a Junior Suite and asked for a quiet room. We had a small suite - separate bedroom and sitting room - at the back of the hotel looking down onto a little garden and one of the \"calle\". It was totally quiet. Just perfect! The room was nicely furnished, spotlessly clean and had a nice bathroom with Jacuzzi. The hotel staff were very friendly and helpful, and made us feel at home. The welcome drink and snacks was lovely, as was the bottle of wine we found in our room. The AC worked perfectly and we were able to adjust it to our needs. The hotel does not have a restaurant - there is a breakfast room (a bit small) and a breakfast buffet, which is adequate, was included in the room rate. I personally do not think you can get good bread in Italy, but the rolls on the buffet came close. We asked for black coffee and were served \"caff\u00c3\u00a9 americano\" which we really do not like. I then asked for espresso doppio and they were brought promptly and with a smile. I heard someone order boiled eggs, but for us the scrambled eggs and bacon and sausages on the buffet were more than enough. Because there was no restaurant we looked around the area for somewhere to have a light lunch and found the Ristorante S. Stefano on the Campo S. Stefano, close to the hotel. I had a fantastic grilled Branzino, served with potatoes and olives. I recommend this little place for meals if one is staying at the Sant'Angelo and doesn't really want to go very far away. I should also add as a tip - if you drive to venice and therefore must park your car, reserve a place in advance at the Tronchetto parking garage, at the entrance to Venice. You can reserve a VIP place, which is guarded and locked. On arrival you are taken to your place, and you can lock your car. It is really very safe. The cost was EUR 30 for 24 hours which we thought was reasonable for the care taken. From there you can take vaporetto line 2 into the centre of Venice (EUR6.50 pp) OR take a water taxi for EUR 60.

It is so worth it and the water taxis are gorgeous sleek timber panelled boats with leather upholstery and a wonderful experience.

There are 14 rooms and they are all elegantly decorated and because it is not a large type establishment you get the feel of your own private piece of heaven in one of the most unique places on earth. Really can't say enough good things about the Palazzo, it is elegant, extremely clean and has a great very heplful staff. Bathrooms are terrific being all carrera marble with jacuzzis for some extra relaxation. It is perfectly situated with a short walk to the Rialto area and a short walk in the other direction to the St. Marks Square area. The breakfast is delicious and plentiful and served in a classy comfortable room that is very inviting. We were leaving on a late night train to Nice from Venice and the Palazzo was happy to hold our luggage after checkout in the morning until late that evening...said it was no problem which was a great relief for us. Then were great to arrange for a late water taxi to the train station for us...really couldn't have been more helpful....these are the little things that make good trips even better! One note...I was emailing the Palazzo with some questions and they had tried to get through to me by return email and were having trouble getting through so they called my home to answer my questions....now that's great service that can't be beat!!!!! Oh and while talking with them on the phone I happened to mention that we had stayed there before.....when we arrived they had given us the same room we had the first time and a bottle of champagne on ice....what a special touch....like I said we felt we were home in Venice!

More sound-proof windows are a possible fix, but if that's the only drawback of this place, it was okay by us. For us, the canal view was definitely worth the noise.

Tomas, the barman, and Lamberto, the concierge, will make every effort to see that your needs are met promptly, courteously and always with a \"little something extra.\" Another plus is the generous breakfast, which had a great selection, compared to many small European hotels. One word of advice - if you want a full canal view, be sure to specify that in your reservation, and don't rely on the booking website description of a \"canal view\". Some rooms have a limited or restricted view, but are still identified as having a canal view.

Here is my experience which you may find helpful. Lobby and entrance is beautiful..polished marble and stone everywhere..very luxurious! A/C was very good..the weather in Venice was hot but the hotel lobby and our rooms were nice and cool. I had two rooms, actually they upgraded me to junior suites..both decorated with beautiful colors and glorious fabrics..beds and seating all first class... but there is more to say...the first room was wonderful...Two windows, quite spacious for Venice, good layout and a beautiful marble bathroom. The second room was the problem...although the bathroom was large, the room layout was very awkward and claustrophobic...long, narrow room...hardly enough room to get to the other side of the bed....and only one window. They called it a jr suite because it had a small alcove with a love seat, but that was hardly useful. So... when you book make sure you do not get one of those rooms. The location...it is right on the grand canal...however in my opinion this hotel is only worthwhile if you have a direct front canal view....the minor canal view on the side is only good for seeing the laundry trucks and adjacent building wall, like an alley way... and not much light gets in....so if you book here, make sure to ask if you are getting a direct front room...otherwise I personally would look elsewhere. Another word on location...the hotel is right on the grand canal next to a vaporetto stop which makes using the vaporetto very convenient, but if you don't need to be on the water and you prefer to be in a more central area near shops, cafes and night life... then this hotel is definitely out of the way...nothing right near by...everything is a walk ..not really a far walk but a walk nonetheless...sometimes we felt like we needed a little spot nearby..but there is none. So you have to decide what you need..vaporetto convenience or proximity to a little action. Many hotels have both conveniences..this hotel does not. The food...I only had the included breakfasts here...and in my most recent trip to Italy which also included Florence and Rome...this hotel had the poorest breakfast by far...very meager and somewhat unhelpful staff attending the breakfast area...took a long time to replenish items which had run out...and the selection was quite poor as well...I was quite disappointed to see that the breakfast here was very very inferior to our other hotels in Florence and Rome which were much cheaper hotels...and the breakfast room is very small...quite cramped and you are seated very close to others..somewhat uncomfortable and in my opinion unacceptable for a hotel charging these rates. The reception staff was good...they are happy to help you with a smile...so no complaints there..they arranged a canal cruise and some transfers for me very happily. However...I should mention that I had to leave the hotel at 6 A.M. to catch an early airport flight and there was only one staff member there at that hour...which meant I had to bring all the bags down myself and although I requested some coffee they could not or would not provide it. Again this was unacceptable to me in a hotel of this price caliber. Internet access...I had my own laptop and wifi was good throughout the hotel but nonetheless the terms for access are ridiculous and overpriced...in my florence hotel I had free access... and in my rome hotel you could buy an hour of time and use that time over your entire stay...but here they charge you three euro for one consecutive hour...and you cannot carry over unused time...so each time you want to check your email or check a website for info you have to pay another three euro if it is in a different hour..so you have to plan your internet time very carefully...checking your email three times a day would mean three internet episodes of three euro each...to me this was unacceptable in a hotel that charges this type of rate. Room service...I only ordered drinks and the bartender delivered within minutes...I should mention that two glasses of orange juice and a bucket of ice was about 25 euro...so buyer beware!! In conclusion...although this was the priciest hotel I stayed at on my trip..by far...for me it was really the biggest disappointment...lots of things bothered me...So on my next trip to venice i will look for another hotel.", "Date": "July 10, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "4.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Austin, TX", "Title": "\u201cUnbelievable location\u201d", "Author": "TexasLonghorn6", "ReviewID": "UR7779742", "Content": "Staying right on the Grand Canal in Venice is amazing.

On our last night we got back to the hotel after having dinner out. It was 12:30AM, not too late for us. But for Venice, an early to bed city, it was apparently too late for the hotel. We were shocked to find the front door locked (!!) and the front desk completely deserted. To make things worse, we were caught in the rain and were already wet from our walk home. Mind you, this is a good sized hotel, not a small place. We freaked out and started knocking and ringing our door bell repeatedly- with no answer. Finally, after 15 minutes of standing in now pouring rain, we went to the hotel next door- whose front door was still open, thank you very much- and asked for help. They called on the phone for us, but still no answer. Their person went with us over to the Sant'Angelo, and literally leaned on the door bell. FINALLY our staff person appeared from somewhere in the back, and let us in. We were grateful to be inside, and though upset, would have been OK if the Sant'Angelo employee had seemed apologetic. Instead, he scolded us about not leaving our key with him when we left the hotel at 6PM, so he would know we were out- a \"policy\" no one had ever mentioned. When we said perhaps the problem was the fact that he wasn't at his post, he had the nerve to argue and be angry with us- all the while we are the customers, soaking wet and cold from having been locked out of our own hotel. The following day, we told our story to the morning people at the desk. They were apologetic, but offered no other compensation for our unpleasant experience. SO- this hotel is indeed beautiful- just don't stay out past midnight!", "Date": "October 23, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Denver", "Title": "\u201cFabulous!\u201d", "Author": "ItalyNovice", "ReviewID": "UR5820173", "Content": "This hotel is perfect for a stay in Venice.

To get here from the train station just hop on a Vaperato on the grand canal and get off at the St Angelo stop. It's not far at all. You will see the hotel from the Vaperato and it is only 50 feet from the stop. Great breakfast. If your not happy with this I would be surprised. The room we had #220 had a view of the garden. Not great but the view of the canal rooms are Junior Sites and are about $100 more per night. We paid $400/night. Great service,very clean rooms. No traffic patterns on the carpet. Our room had a living room area,bedroom and ample bath. To go to the airport cheaply just get back on the Vaperato right out side of the hotel and take it to Pt. Roma(1 or 2 stops past the train station. Get off and buy a ticket for about $2.50. It is at the A-1 stop bus # 5. These busses are just like the ones in the states that take you to the car rental places at airports in the USA,quite modern with areas for luggage. The \"water taxis\" are $130 one way. Not neccesary unless you have money to burn. This property is very convienent and out of the way from the crowded areas. There are nice Piazzos very close. This is a nice property and your wife will love it. My credit card company did a fraud check while I was staying here and the front desk at thier expence and insistance paid for a call to the USA. Nice. Quaint bar and lounging area. No internet as of yet though. They say it's coming soon.

Buy a bus ticket in the airport concourse for Piazzale Roma ( fare 3 euros); buses leave every 30 minutes. The water-bus from the bus terminus at P.Roma ( vaporetto no.1) will take you to San Angelo and the hotel entrance is beside the landing-stage. The cost of the single journey is 5 euros and you might consider buying a ticket for a longer period because it can work out expensive if you use the vaporetto extensively during your stay. The hotel is welcoming and the rooms are comfortable and quiet; the loudest thing in our room was the wallpaper. Maid service is of the highest standard and towel and bed-sheet changing is frequent to the point of being excessive. We did find the room a bit stuffy on the first night and we made the mistake of opening the windows. The mosquitoes swarmed in and we were badly bitten; lesson, take repellent. By the second night the air-conditioning had taken over and we had no more trouble. Breakfast is very good and plentiful. No hotel restaurant during our stay but there are good restaurants nearby; none of them are cheap ( nothing is in Venice). Budget for about 40 euros per person for a dinner with wine. The hotel is almost equidistant from San Marco and Rialto and both are within walking distance; as is Accademia which is a very short distance away and is the most interesting and charming part of the city. The touts will offer to take you from San Marco to Murano by water-taxi for nothing but do bear in mind that they won't bring you back unless you buy some of their gaudy and expensive glass. Go, nevertheless, Murano is worth a visit, good lunches available, and you can always come back on the' vaporetto'. Returning to the airport; as a variation, use the alilaguna from San Marco; a journey of about 60 minutes and costing 11 euros. A good way to leave the city but a long walk from the landing-stage to the terminal.", "Date": "May 4, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Los Angeles, California", "Title": "\u201cA lovely Hotel, with great location\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR4965611", "Content": "Because tripadvisor was so helpful in planning my trip, I promised myself I would give reports on all the places we stayed throughout Italy.

The location couldnt be better, being both on the grand canal and footsteps away from a water bus pickup and drop off. Additionally they have a private dock where water taxi's can be arranged to pick you up and drop you off. The location to popular attractions and sites couldnt be better, with the rialto bridge in clear sight, and St. Marks on a 5-8 min walk through the charming alleyways of Venice. Furthermore, went we mentioned to the concierge that we were leaving for florence where we would be staying with another hotel in the Sina Hotel group, he called ahead and arranged for us to get the best room available.
