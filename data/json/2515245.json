The metro line is very close also, however we never really used it as we would walk to the Eiffel Tower every morning (only 15-20 mins and is quite enjoyable) and use that as our starting base for the day. Breakfast was well worth paying for with plenty of traditional french cheese, meats, bread and croissants which gave us a great start to the day.

Firstly, the hotel was easy to find, just a couple minutes from the Vaugirard Metro station in the 15th arrondissement of Paris. While slightly away from the city centre the fact you are close to the Metro makes a world of difference as it provides quick and easy access in and out. The hotel itself is located down a quiet road with automatic doors to welcome you in. Check in was effortless and we were taken to our room, a twin bed room which was a decent size for two people although we had to push the bed together! Outside the window on the small balcony there is a decent view of the street and the Eiffel Tower in the distance. In the room you have a flat screen TV with around 30 French channels, kettle with condiments to make tea and coffee, a large wardrobe with safe inside, a desk and a small fridge \u2013 all the basic and helpful things you would expect from a 3 star hotel room. The rooms are cleaned daily around midday so once you have come back from a day out expect to find your room spotless with a top up on tea, coffee and biscuits. The bathroom was spacious enough with towels and shampoo, body lotion and shower gel provided. I would recommend anyone booking this hotel to try and get a deal that includes breakfast as it\u2019s certainly worth it. I woke up at 8am to ensure I didn\u2019t miss the breakfast buffet that included pancakes, croissants, cereal, yogurts, toast and a variety of other continental style breakfast treats which saves you spending extra money at a cafe or restaurant.", "Date": "February 20, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Los Angeles, California", "Title": "\u201cI loved this place and What a View of the Eiffel tower\u201d", "Author": "Mark B", "ReviewID": "UR123129211", "Content": "This was a great place to stay and got a great deal on some web site for only 95 euro a night with breakfast.

The beds were comfortable and good internet in the room and a great view. The lobby was like new and modern, the breakfast was just ok. There is an elevator although very small only 2 people can fit in it but sure comes in handy to avoid all the stairs. Location was a 3 min walk to the metro and there's a Indian restaurant down the street where I had the best Indian food ever! We tried the walk one night to the Eiffel tower it took about 1/2 hour very nice walk and felt very safe at all times took the metro back. There's 2 grocery stores by the metro and a Starbucks.

I particularly liked the location of the hotel:south of the River Siene/Eiffel Tower (20-30min walk), quiet location with a supermarket and bakery nearby. The metro station was only a few blocks away with a lovely little park where we would sometimes have breakfast. (we didn't eat breakfast inside the hotel so can't comment).

The hotel is not right in the middle of Paris but this is nice as you get away from the 'madness' of the city so can relax a bit more. The reception area was being decorated while we stayed but this did not bother us at all. I had a room on the 5th floor with a lovely little balcony from which I could see the Eiffel Tower so could enjoy watching it twinkling later at night. My Mum and niece shared a twin room on the 4th floor, while they did not have a balcony, they had a railing which they could peer over at the Eiffel Tower and were perfectly happy. Both rooms were renovated and spotlessly clean with everything you need...good TV in a good position (although you don't come to Paris to watch TV but nice when getting ready or chilling before sleep), mini bar, safe in the wardrobe, tea/coffee making facilities (a rarity!), hairdryer and nice toiletries with a really good shower. The air conditioning worked brilliantly too which was a godsend as it was a pretty clammy 3 nights. The breakfast was perfectly fine..croissants, pastries, bread, cheese, ham, cereals, yoghurt, fruit, etc...set us up very nicely for a day of sightseeing. We ordered breakfast, in the room, on the final day so we could take our time getting ready to depart the hotel...this was delivered with no problems whatsoever. The lady who does the breakfast and cleans rooms was so lovely and friendly and always had a smile on her face. In fact, all of the staff were very good and helpful and very welcoming when coming in at any time. As mentioned in other reviews, the lift is very small...the smallest I've ever been in but it works just fine!!

We had a particularly lovely meal in L'Avergne (I think!!)...which is just down the bottom of the road of the hotel and across the road there...super service and wonderful grub at a very reasonable price and the waiter went out of his way to change things on the menu to suit my fussy niece!! We ate in another couple of not so good restaurants but they were ok for the money. We only used a Carnet each of metro tickets and this was getting from Gard Du Nord to Vaugirard as well when arriving. We decided to take a taxi back for the Eurostar as we were all a bit too tired to use the metro...it only cost 22 euros which we thought was great value as it's quite a decent journey. Note: if you go to visit the Sacre Coeur and get off at Absesses metro, make sure you take the lift as the stairs go on forever...we made the mistake and I nearly had an asthma attack!! This was my 4th visit to this fabulous city and won't be my last...I would most definitely consider staying at Val Girard hotel again as it's the best hotel I've stayed in, in Paris, by far and I've done 4 stars too.

During the whole break we found Parisiens to be very friendly, not at all aloof as we expected and we felt safe both walking the city and riding the Metro late at night. You can see the Eiffel Tower from the front bedrooms (you do have to peer left up the street, but it is visible). Don't make the mistake we did of trying to walk to the Eiffel Tower thinking it was just up the road. It's so huge you can see it from all over the city and as you walk it seems to get further and further away! It is within walking distance of the hotel but only in comfortable shoes, and probably not in heels after a romantic meal and a few drinks as I tried to do! We found attractions and the Metro reasonably priced, but sit-down meals cost a fortune. I suggest you try to get takeaway baguettes or sandwiches for your lunch as lunch in a cafe will easily set you back \u00a340. Save your pennies for dinner. Over the road from the hotel are some gardens and the City Hall, and a lovely restaurant called Le Cap. This was full of locals when we visited and if you say that the hotel recommended the restaurant they will give you complementary drinks. Another great restaurant was just down the street called Le Petel. Very authentic French food which was divine. There is a creperie up the road near the Metro station which was handy for a snack on our return late at night from the latin quarter! All round a great trip, would love to live in the South East so I could just hop on the Eurostar and visit more often! Just one hint. Do check whether your room includes breakfast because we believed ours did and were presented with a bill for 75 Euros as we checked out.", "Date": "June 15, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Stockton-on-Tees, UK", "Title": "\u201cPerfect base for our Paris honeymoon\u201d", "Author": "KEVandTRACEY", "ReviewID": "UR112082898", "Content": "We stayed at val Girard for our honeymoon and can say that the hotel was lovely, The staff were very friendly and extremley helpful and all spoke good English.

Since the bathroom had nowhere to hang our towels to dry, we had to put them on the floor and get new ones. Unfortunately, housekeeping would always put at least one towel on the bidet--which is the equivalent to putting it on rim of the toilet! The worst part of the whole experience was this: My mom was sick and had a runny nose at night on her pillow, which left a pretty nasty stain. The next day, she put the pillowcase on the floor as a signal that it needed to be changed. Housekeeping picked the pillowcase off the floor and put it right back on the pillow!!!! With the same exact stain!!! Believe me, it was gross enough as is, but the fact that housekeeping chose it pick it up off the floor and put it right back on was the final straw--hence, the 1 star rating. They would also neglect to replace our used beverage glasses, until we put them on the floor next to the garbage can. We were pleased upon arrival to the hotel--the receptionists was very friendly and the reception area was modern. We were pretty content until we realized that the air conditioner was not functioning since the hotel turns it off during the cool months.

The view from our room was okay, you could see the Eiffel Tower (just, and if you leaned out of the window), but the Parisian architecture was still pleasant to look at. We booked an upgraded room, the only apparent difference being that it had a bath instead of a shower stall, although the room was still a fair size with the bigger bathroom. We did not take the extra option of breakfast; aside from the fact there was a bakery down the road for much cheaper, as another reviewer pointed out, we had planned on late nights and late mornings, so we wouldn't have been up in time anyway. The room was always cleaned and beds made up every night, and soaps etc. replaced. We only stayed for three nights, but the sheets were stil changed at least once, which I wasn't really expecting. The staff all seemed very nice, and helped us in any way they could, from directions and advice to telling us when our taxi arrived. The only (slight) negative is the comically-small lift; the two of us had to stack ourselves and our cases like Tetris blockst to get to the room, although this was only a minor inconvenience.

Staff at reception were very welcoming and friendly, and gave us information on how to get to other places when asked, as we had already booked to go and stay at disneyland paris for a few days also. Breakfast was very nice, typical continental breakfast with fruit juices, hot chocolate, tea and coffee available.

The eiffel tower is a must, was fantastic to go to the very top! just 13.10 euros. Try being there when it goes a little darker, its amazing. I would also reccomend getting on the bateaux bus (boat along the seine, you can hop on and hop off when you want an takes you to the famous attractions... eiffel tower, louvre, notre dame etc etc ) an this was just 13 euros also. Lots of nice restaurants, aswell as subway, mcdonalds etc. I particulary didnt find Paris expensive as others do... drinks like tea/ hot chocolate etc are the most expensive, your looking at 5 euros.
