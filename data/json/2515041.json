Overall our stay was not what we expected it to be. We made some remarks and the receptiondesk asked us NOT to post a review on TA; they promised to make up for the mistakes made. However, they did not contact us anymore (and rest assured; I've given them some time) and we subsequently were not 'tempted' to make another reservation. Obviously there are some pro's to mention about this hotel. Hughe rooms, very nicely decorated and immaculately clean. Staff is helpfull and friendly. Recommandations for restaurants can be improved. Location is good (16th, residential neighbourhood) but not the best in Paris. But easy to reach by car and always a subway-station - rather - closeby. However, if you compare this hotel - pricewise only - with other 5-star addresses in Paris, I would not stay here again. For starters; no elevator. Parking offered is a problem; for somewhat larger cars (not so strange in this segment) the parking spaces offered are just too small. I had to park in the street and was initially charged for one of their private parking (...). But foremost, the way they persisted in asking us not to post a review without ever contacting us again is definately not the way it should be. It's a nice place but certainly not the best value for money in Paris.", "Date": "April 5, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cA Parisian Gem!\u201d", "Author": "Pointroaddurban", "ReviewID": "UR127109231", "Content": "This is not my first stay at Jays Paris, but this is my first review ever on TripAdvisor.

So I chose Jays on the basis of its trip advisor reviews, obviously I have no direct comparison that I can make with regard to other Parisian hotels in terms of accomodation or price. What I can say about Jays is that I would liken it to staying with a friend rather than staying at a hotel. The 'personalisation' of the experience was second to none, we were greeted by name before opening our mouths and that is the level of attention received thereafter. We were greeted whenever we appeared in the lobby either to leave or arrive back, offered drinks and refreshments each time - it really was a case of ' nothing was too much trouble '. I simply cannot believe that any other city hotel could have done the same. No this hotel does not have a pool and steam room, a huge restuarant or well stocked bar but that is not what Jays is about and why would you need them when you are surrounded by more restaurants than you could visit in a month of Sundays! The staff spend time with you advising on how to get the best out of Paris, places to visit, places to eat ( of course you may not always agree with the choices but that is personal opinion ) and all really go above and beyond. I have only ever received service at this level from establishment owners and the odd member of staff - not the whole team. We were upgraded upon arrival to a second floor suite ( the hotel seemed quieter than I expected and maybe it was a slow period but it is still a nice touch to be upgraded), the room was spacious, clean and comfortable - the fruit left each day was lovely and the chocolates enjoyed by my other half! Everything you could need was in the room, right down to an i pod dock to recharge your phone - the only thing they could have done was provide some fresh milk in the fridge - all the drink making facilities were available but no milk. Breakfast is extra ( 10 euros each ) and nothing to get excited about but again you are surrounded with so much choice within five minutes walk that it is really not a problem. Its location is ideal to visit all the attractions and if you use the Metro anywhere within the City is easily and cheaply accesible. My only regret - I forgot to leave my envelope with a tip for the excellent staff, it got packed in my case by mistake - so apologies to all - will double it up next time! I really would not believe any guest who stays at Jays and said they were dissapointed - if you are then you must be used to staying in places only used by the very wealthy and paying the price tag to match.", "Date": "March 5, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "5.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "liverpool", "Title": "\u201clovely place for a birthday treat\u201d", "Author": "sasha80", "ReviewID": "UR125315214", "Content": "we stayed at jays for 3 nights last week for my 50th birthday.

We had a connecting room with our girls and their bed was covered with stuffed bears.

The bathroom amenities were all by Clarins and Hermes; after one shower, I smelled as good as the hotel. The bedding was luxurious and we slept like rocks all week.

This meant that we had 3 double inter-connecting bedrooms and two bathrooms along with a kitchennette and computer. As the rooms are spacious it felt like a large apartment and everyone was happy. Although the total price was expensive it was for a special occasion and what you are paying for is the special level of personal service.

However in Paris you end up eating a lot of food so maybe it is not such a bad thing to start the day with a light breakfast.

Almost every reviewer mentioned,the hotel is so clean and beautiful, rooms are spacious( you have a huge closet ), and have well working air-conditioning. Those advantages the reviewer said are quite right,and deserve the high reputations. I want to emphasize two more great points this hotel has. 1;Location It's a short walking distance to Arc de triomphe de l'Etoile. You have Metro 1 line there. It runs along Seine liver,where you can cover the most famous sightseeing places. And that line has many correspondence,so you can easily get where you want to go. If you walk down southward along Avenue Kleber,5-10min walk will bring you Trocadero. In there you can have beautiful view of Effel tower,and you can rest at busy but cozy cafe. In another direction,you can find Avenue Victor Hugo. It's a beautiful street where you'll find something you like. Those places are chic and quiet,very much like in Paris atmosphere. It's not so crowded / touristic as say,Louvre or Opera. 2;Hotel staffs As soon as you book Jays,they send you the detailed information about the Hotel itself and the restaurants they recommend. And by e-mail,you can get what you want. Say,the reservations for the restaurants,the opera tickets,the museum passes before you arrive Paris. They are really skillful and talented, The most importantly,they are deal with your requests with pleasure.While you're in this Hotel,a few steps down from your room,they are always waiting for you to answer to your tiny concerns,and ready to serve you a cup of coffee with smiles. I just think that such kindnesses are rarely seen in the touristic city like Paris. It's a great relief for the tourists,especially for the Paris first timer like us.

For Paris, the rooms at Jays are large, but sill remain cozy. The suite had a discrete hidden kitchenette. Like before, the bathroom had robes, a towel warmer (especially appreciated during our chilly stay), the Clarins products, and now, a really nice bottle of Hermes perfume - a really understated scent, that I loved and wore throughout my trip instead of the fragrance I brought with me. In hindsight, I should've taken it with me when I left since I now can't find it, but I didn't want to feel greedy. :-) They made reservations for us for a couple of resturants from their extensive book of recommended restaurants. They were very interested in knowing our level of satisfaction with the service and meals at these restaurants to make sure they can continue to recommend them to other guests. While many of the staff were different, the hospitality was not. Everyone who works at the hotel is genuinely interested in ensuring you have an unbelievable stay in Paris. They are interested in knowing what you have planned for the day and how you enjoyed it afterwards. This personal service and attention to each guest is what sets Jays apart from other hotels and what they do best.", "Date": "May 15, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Dove Canyon, CA", "Title": "\u201cPerfect hotel for our first trip to Paris.\u201d", "Author": "Kelmoc", "ReviewID": "UR108011612", "Content": "Although I have never posted a review on any of my previous hotel stays, I felt I needed to post one for The Jays. My 9 year old daughter and I stayed there at the end of April and I don't think either of us could be more satisfied and appreciative of how wonderful the hotel was and how well we were treated by the staff. The amazing customer service started way before our trip. Judy and Ivan (and Philippe when we arrived) helped secure reservations to restaurants (including a few 3 star Michelin), the opera, lunches, monument and museum pass, a driver for airport pick-up and drop-off, and so much more. Judy was able to do this all on only a few weeks\u2019 notice, due to my procratination. We arrived at the hotel from overseas at about 4pm and the staff had all of our clothes pressed by the time we went to Guy Savoy's at 8:45pm. The hotel is small, beautiful, impeccably kept and perfectly matched for Paris. The suite (Art Deco) was spacious and had wonderful artistic touches throughout. The bathroom was modern, large and fully accommodating. Yes, it is true; they do have towel warmers in the bathrooms. We were connected to the Salon, so computer access and kitchen/lounge amenities were readily accessible. When we needed a taxi, the staff had one ready for us. When my daughter wanted her hair done in Paris, the staff got us in at Lucie Saint -Clair (twice). When we were starving after coming back from the 3 hour opera Tosca at 11:30pm, the hotel had some nice snacks for us AND Ivan personally took us to a local store for a more hearty meal that Michelle helped us prepare when we returned. Ivan did this even though he was technically off work. Personally, the best part of my stay was the interaction with the hotel staff. I absolutely loved the late night conversations with Michelle, Charles and Ivan. I truly appreciated how patient they were with my pitiful attempts at French, my interest in speaking on a variety of subjects that may have been a bit mundane for Paris natives, and their overall enthusiasm regarding all things relating to my daughter or me. For those who need it, all the staff spoke fluent English. I am sorry to make the review so long, but The Jays was an integral part of making my first trip to Paris (and my father/daughter bonding trip) absolutely perfect. I will stay there each time I am in Paris and I have recommended it to anyone here in California that will listen. By the time we left, the staff honestly felt like family/friends.

The first time was a quick trip while we were in London last Summer. This time we planned a longer stay and thought we could see more of Paris. We, meaning me, my wife, and two children, ages 10 and 6. It is a small hotel, kids need to be on best behavior if traveling as a family. We wanted to again experience Paris away from the big hotels and crowds and Jays fits the bill. Travel enough and all the big hotels start to look the same no matter where you are. The personal touch of such a small hotel like Jays is something very special. When I say small, that only has to do with the number of rooms, not the size of the rooms. We had two adjoining suites and more than ample space for the four of us. Each suite was well appointed and decorated to make you feel you were staying in your fine Paris apartment rather than a hotel. The bathrooms in our suites were large as well. The common areas were spacious quiet and relaxing, also well decorated. The free wifi was an added benefit. If you are considering going to Paris for a short or long trip, what are you waiting for? Go! The first time we went we were a little intimidated about navigating the city as first-timers and with kids in tow. Jays made the city accessible to us. The second time the staff at Jays were at the ready to help us explore and discover more of this wonderful city. From Jay's location it is all right there for you. Walk to great restaurants, shops, sites, through interesting neighborhoods, and the local restaurants are not tourist traps. These are mostly small restaurants where Parisians from the neighborhoods surrounding Jays are dining. Slow down, emphasize your good manners, attempt to speak some French, and you will be welcomed around Paris. For the experience we were trying to get from our trip to Paris, the value was excellent. If you are looking for big hotels with 200+ rooms, four restaurants under roof, a huge gym, a pool, tour bus stops at the foot of the hotel, Jays is not for you, but if you are looking for small boutique hotel that can get you away from the crowds and allow for you to slow life down and enjoy Paris from within a neighborhood, Jays is for you. If you have not been to Paris before and are thinking about it, you can do this. Go to Paris. You will not be disappointed. Enjoy!

It truly is a home away from home. The perfect place to feel as if you own your own place in Paris without any of the hassles. The boutique hotel (and I would equate it more to a luxurious bed & breakfast) is not that easy to identify -no signs, just a small plaque at the entrance. How lovely. We had been in Paris at another hotel (not a very good one), then went to Brugges, then to Amsterdam to two amazing hotels so wanted our last night in Paris to be extraordinary. We took a suite that faced the street. Something magical about opening \"your\" windows in a robe provided by the hotel to a balcony filled with flowers, while across the street there is an older woman watering her flowers waving a bonjour out to you. You feel at home immediately. Check-in is done in the lobby/living room as you sip un noisette (expresso with a dash of milk) or surf the internet. (Only complaint I have is that once in the room they were having wireless problems and I was not able to connect in the room at all.) Pampering is unobtrusive (chocolates and fruit awaiting in the room.) Then a cold small bottle of champagne delivered to our door. Judy, the proprietress is delightful and helpful. May I suggest that if you are not familiar with Paris to contact her first - she knows her city well. We were not in the room much... Paris at our private door entrance awaited for us to bid it farewell, but if there was ever a place that could have kept me inside, it would have been this one.

The idea is good - a boutique hotel of just 5 rooms - with a blend of interesting contemporary decor and some antiques, good sized bedrooms and a promise of excellent and personal service. But the promise was far from fulfilled. It looked good when we arrived. A pleasant seemingly helpful 30 something guy checked us in over a complimentary drink, giving us the low down on the hotel and with a few tips about the locality and then showed us to the room. Our suite was a good size yes but nothing very special. No view from our room - just a flat internal roof with some plants and a skylight over the manager's office. It was a cold January weekend but the air-conditioning / heating didn't work properly and wouldn't climb above 19.5C. The management (consisting it seems of two identikit male managers - each doing 12 hour shifts. We saw no other staff during our 2 day stay) couldn't sort it out and in the end had to give us a portable heater on the second night. The TV system was the most 'unuser-friendly' system I have come across. It was consistently locking off and we had to call the management up six times during our stay to put it right. In the end the day manager gave up trying with a polite but typical gallic shrug. We came down for breakfast after our first night only to be told that it wasn't available as we should have ordered it before 7pm the previous evening. Perhaps our helpful check-in manager was not so helpful after all. Many apologies were then forthcoming but no breakfast! That evening we were reminded three times to order breakfast so the embarassment would not be repeated. So we did order. What was on our plates the next morning was the simplest of simple continental breakfasts - baguette, croissant, fresh juice and coffee / tea, Fine. But very much a 2 star petit dejeuner in a four star hotel. (And not included in the \u20ac440 per night charge). When we checked out we asked Day Manager to order a taxi to Gare du Nord. He do so and a few minutes later was helping us and our baggage into the car. As we got in he said to the taxi driver 'Charles de Gaulle, s'il vous plait.' Fortunately I overheard him and put the driver right. Quite sure it was a genuine mistake... anyone could have made it, couldn't they?! Jays - ok at \u20ac200 per night perhaps.

The hotel is perfect in everyway, just like all of the reviews say, I have to admit I was a bit skeptical, but can say beyond a shadow of a doubt that this truly is a wonderful hotel.

They booked everything from our transport to and from the train station to all of our lunch, and dinner reservations, as well we were able to get tickets to the Louvre and other attractions which was very convenient.

Jane was superb, she took us to all the main attractions, knew all the bus and Metro lines which was huge given we had such precious time. She is very knowlegable on Paris, the history, all the venues we visited etc. She was well worth the small price we paid, she even recommended how we should arrange the rest of our visit, where to go, and how to get there, thus helping us maximise our time, absolutely a fantastic service.

What a fabulous stay my husband and I had here with our children!! Every moment at this hotel was so enjoyable that frankly, we didn't feel like leaving its sanctuary even to venture out into spectacular Paris. I'm not sure what the previous reviewer was referring to when he called this building \"nondescript\"...it is stunningly beautiful and full of character. From the red carpet that welcomes you in, the skylights that softly illuminate the lobby, the marble staircase that elegantly winds its way up, the intricate wrought iron gates, the lounge filled with roses and orchids, to the understated, tasteful and sophisticated decor- the attention to painstaking detail is abundantly visible at every turn. The welcome we received after a long and tiring train journey is worthy of mention. Instead of walking up to a check in counter, we were seated comfortably in the plush lounge area and Stefan offered us a variety of hot and cold drinks along with cookies while our children squealed with delight at the laughing Elmo in the entryway. The formalities were completed within seconds and we were led up to our room. A lovely little fruit tray and a box of chocolates awaited us in the serenity and beauty of our Fantasie suite which has been superbly decorated with a rare and difficult to achieve aesthetic balance of antique as well as modern furniture and fittings and the softest carpet I have ever stepped on (I want it in my home!!) An array of plush toys had been set up to the sheer joy of our children and my little one had been provided with a lovely set of towels, blankets and a pillow embroidered with teddy bears. The amenities were luxurious with Clarins products in the bathroom, and to our surprise there was even a full kitchen hidden away discreetly within the bar area with a microwave, stove, refrigerator, pots, pans and washing supplies. During our entire stay, Stefan was absolutely phenomenal. He was always ready with a smile and completely pampered us, tending to our every need personally and even running out into the street to ensure our children were safe and walking my son to the corner to point out the Eiffel tower to him. Judy was incredibly warm and kind, reading books to them and even pulled out train sets and toys to happily engage them while we got detailed maps and instructions for our sojourn into Paris from Stefan. I was completely bowled over by them both- we felt like we were staying with unbelievably kind family rather than at a hotel. Even Anthony (from the night staff) took great care of us, quickly and efficiently helping us with all our requests. The morning of our departure, Judy and Stefan took photos of our family with their own camera and saw us out to our taxi smiling and waving goodbye as we drove away. We were literally shaking our heads in disbelief at the overwhelming warmth on their part and were actually sad to leave! Thank you so much tripadvisor for alerting us to this absolute gem. We have stayed at the best hotels in the world including many Leading hotels and Four Seasons and Ritz Carltons and have never experienced anything like this before. We will never stay anywhere else when in Paris and are already awaiting our next trip there.

However, once we were seen, all changed. This hotel has all of 5 tidy, comfortable rooms with a staff of 3-4 people. There's no grand lobby, but you feel a sense of calm in a very busy and crowded city. Thus, the main reason for the #1 rating is the absolute 1 on 1 service.

Let me start by saying i had a wonderful experience at Jays even though there was no elevator, (which I did not know about), but as soon as you walk into Jays, you enter a fairy tale world where all your hospitality needs are met and even excelled! The lobby is filled with sensational aromas of fresh bouquets of flowers everywhere, the little hike up the stairs to your room isn\u2019t even all that bad when you become encapsulated by the amazing d\u00e9cor and service. The feeling I got at Jays is nothing like I\u2019ve ever felt before. I felt like I belonged there, and that I was a special guest at their small hotel that consisted of 5 rooms. I\u2019ll be honest with you, I am a travel agent and I have stayed at some reputable hotels and none of them can even compare to the exclusive category of excellence that Jays had to offer. The Ritz is still a high end hotel in Paris, and I am not going to say anything about their hotel, however unless you\u2019re a celebrity with a big body guard, than don\u2019t expect the celebrity treatment. All the staff at Jays were wonderful, from Edmond to Judy to Phillip, Stephen , Ivan and the rest of the gang! Don\u2019t worry about languages at all! Everyone that works there spoke English (to some extent) and French. A few of staff members also spoke German and Russian, but the point is, there is no language barrier, so don\u2019t worry! They were all unbelievably helpful and tended to any which whim we might have had. As simple as asking where the nearest flower store was, they gave us directions verbally and then printed out directions for us, that came with a map, estimated time of arrival by walking or by taxi, and always made sure to check in with us afterwards that the directions were good. We had an interesting incident happen one day. We came back to the hotel with our friend and went up to the room to freshen up before heading out for dinner. Our friend was very impressed with our room and she pointed out how we had a great selection of fruits already arranged on the table in our room. Within five minutes, one of the kind gentlemen from downstairs walked in with a complimentary tray of chilled Champagne and Foie Gras to welcome our guest... We were astonished!

Jays is the real deal.\u201d", "Author": "gtenser", "ReviewID": "UR70796993", "Content": "After 4 nights at the Four Seasons in Provence, we headed up to Paris with our nearly 6 year old and 3.5 year old. We had selected Jays purely on these reviews, and we were admittedly quite nervous. Jays' driver, who had picked us up at the train station (the kids love trains) pulled up to the simple blue doors in the highly trendy 16th arrondissement, and all early trepidations were immediately dispelled. The beautiful marble staircase, the welcoming arms of the eager staff, the professional calm and ease of owner Judy, the Four Seasons style check in (sit on the couch, have a drink, relax and de-stress while the luggage is brought to your room, etc...) after 5 nights my family and I can, without qualification, highly recommend this unique boutique hotel. Rooms: We were given the connecting Provence and Le Duo suites for ourselves and our kids. The only other room on our floor was Le Salon, a bonus room which was essentially our kitchen, sitting room, chess/computer/game room. The kids loved Le Duo \u2013 teddy bears and stuffed tigers on the shelves, a beautifully appointed room and bathroom, soft carpeting, low-to-the-ground bed for ease of entry and exit and no nighttime safety concerns. Our Provence suite was extremely spacious, lovely, highly functional and comfortable. The fruit presentation in both rooms that awaited us each day upon our return from sightseeing, as well as the Fauchon chocolates that adorned our pillows as we returned from dinner each night provided delicious accents to the evening. These rooms are quite large, carpeted, comfortable, functional, and tastefully appointed, with immaculate bathrooms attached, top of the line Moen faucets, handheld shower heads in addition to fixed making bathing the kids a breeze. It felt immediately like home. Staff: The staff is terrific, and as you can count the number of total guests on two hands, they essentially work for you and you alone. Philippe, the day manager, offered us his card, so we were able to call him directly with any daytime issues. The entire team was quite helpful, warm and kind, and someone is always on duty \u2013 anytime you return, there\u2019s a friendly face welcoming you back, ready to handle any request you might have. Location for Food: The 16th arrondissement is commonly thought to be one of the wealthiest parts of Paris, and it appears that the restaurant industry has caught up with this fact. A handful of Michelin-starred restaurants are literally just a few blocks away. Jays has a large book in the Reception Lounge with menus and representative bills from numerous local eateries, which is a nice touch. Recommendations and write ups of local restaurants are also in your room, and the staff is quick to offer their suggestions. Our first night we took a suggestion and walked two blocks to ETC (Epicurean Traditional Cuisine), run by a former 3-michelin star rated chef (from Ledoyen) and had a terrific tasting menu meal (while ETC gladly outfitted our kids with a fabulous steak and potatoes). There is a fruit and sundries bodega one block away, and a full supermarket around the corner, so we kept our fridge (and the fridge in the salon) filled with beverages and snacks. Two terrific boulangeries (bakery shops for breads and sandwiches-our go-to take out breakfast spots) are well within walking distance. We had some dinner reservations at a few top restaurants in place prior to arrival, but otherwise we felt no need to leave the 16th for dinner, getting our Bistro fix as well as a sushi fix all in easy walking distance. Location for Touring: The Arc de Triomphe de l\u2019Etoile is a few blocks away. The Eiffel Tower is also reached relatively easily by foot, even with the young kids. There are three metro stations serving two different lines no more than a couple of blocks from the hotel. We found Jays to provide a rather easy launching point for our day tours. Bottom line, we will most assuredly return to Jays when we return to Paris. It was truly a home away from home. We were relatively low-touch patrons, not requiring a great deal of aide, and Jays shined. I can easily see how they would also shine for higher-need patrons.

We were in the Asie Suite, a beautiful light and spacious room over looking a small roof top garden. A welcome plate of fruit (a fresh one every afternoon) awaited us. We had previously booked our restaurants through Jays after having been sent a list. All of these turned out to be very good. We had intended to go by train to Giverny the next day but unfortunately the trains were on strike so Jays managed to arrange at very short notice a car and driver (William from Calista Privilege) to take us instead. This turned out to be the best part of our trip. He was wonderful even taking us to a store to purchase a charger for my husbands phone which he had forgotten to take. As Versailles which we should have visited in the afternoon was also closed due to the strike, (we have been before so it didn't matter), after lunch at a beautiful riverside restaurant he chose for us, he then took us to some small museums containing impressionist paintings in Paris as he had listened to the kind of places we had wanted to visit. Nothing was too much trouble and this proved to be the point all through our holiday. Over the following days that we spent with Jays they continued to provide us with many suggestions of places to visit some quite different to what we had originally chosen but all proved to be the best choice and their knowledge was greatly appreciated. All in all a wonderful place to stay. Just a couple of points, I did miss contact with other guests as with the hotel only being small we rarely saw anyone else, and the other was that although there was a fridge with wine champagne soft drinks and water that you could help yourself too along with tea and coffee in the lounge, I would have liked to be provided with a complimentary bottle of water in our room but this was charged at 2 euros, which seemed a little odd considering you could take one for nothing from the lounge.

The staff at Jay's are wonderful-Ivan and Stephan who we had most contact with, made us feel like nothing was too much bother and all queries were dealt with efficiently and promptly. Jays biggest bonus is its location. A 5 minute walk in one direction and you are at the Arc De Triomphe-10 minutes the other way and you at the Eiffel Tower. You may think this would put Jays in the middle of a noisy chaos but it is peaceful and quiet and perfect. We had a wonderful 3 nights at Jays and will certainly return here when we are next in Paris. If you are looking for somewhere special to stay, where the staff treat you like friends first and then guests, Jays can be your only destination.", "Date": "December 4, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Ohio", "Title": "\u201cAn Amazing Hotel and a Wonderful Staff\u201d", "Author": "will39", "ReviewID": "UR50489588", "Content": "My husband, our 19-year old daughter and I stayed here for 4 nights and loved every moment.

The location was ideal, tucked away on a quiet back street, 10 mins walk from the Eiffel Tower and the banks of the Seine to the South, and Arc de Triomphe 7 mins stroll to the North. The hotel, and the rooms in particular, were tastefully decorated to a high standard, and although the hotel is somewhat on the small side (which incidentally we thought added to the charm), the rooms are very spacious, which is unusual for Paris. Ok, so there is no dining room/restaurant or bar, but there are so many excellent restaurants/cafes nearby for it not to be an issue. There is also the flexibility of a kitchenette, so bringing food and drink into your room is not a problem, unlike most other hotels I could mention.

We stayed for four night in early July and absolutely enjoyed every minute of our stay. I could write a couple pages gushing over our experience at Jays. All the compliments that have been written in previous postings, we also experienced. This posting will focus on some specific things that stuck out in our minds. Booking: The first-class service begins the moment you contact them. We booked our stay with the hotel directly and received a significantly discounted rate, as well as an upgrade to a suite. Before we arrived, they emailed a pretty comprehensive list of recommended local restaurants and arranged for a driver to pick us up at the airport (a choice we truly appreciated after the long flight). We arrived extremely early for check in, so Philippe made us a couple of cups of coffee and recommended a place to get breakfast near the Eiffel Tower. The room: We stayed in the Louis XIV suite- it looks exactly like the photo on the website. The suite was very spacious and clean. The bed and pillows were extremely comfortable and the drapes blocked out the light. The rooms are quiet- you feel like you are the only patrons in the hotel. There was a small hidden kitchenette in the room. We didn't really use it to make anything, but used the refrigerator for our water. The Clarins products: Ok- this gets its own category. Clarins is a great product, so it is a real treat to get that in a hotel. What has not been said about the Clarins products is that Jays goes beyond the standard shampoo, conditioner, and soap (glycerin, body, and face) for the toiletries. A thoughtful surprise was the inclusion of Clarins body exfoliator, satin oil finish, and aromatherapy oil. In addition, there was a nice had soap and rose lotion that was also in the room. You felt like you were pampering yourself after each shower. The special touches: Each afternoon a plate of fresh fruit was waiting in the room when we came back with a handwritten note. Philipe walking you to the cab or or the corner to ensure that you were walking in the right direction. Stephen helping us buy our train tickets to Bayeux for the middle part of our journey. Gerrit helping us make dinner reservations with one hour's notice. Gerrit taking the time to get to know us and making recommendations for neighborhood that he thought we would appreciate for dinner and drinks (and he was absolutely right!) On our last night, we were treated to a small bottle of champagne to celebrate our last night and Stephen took a couple of pictures. The staff (see also Special Touches): Jays Paris has an amazing staff. At no time did you think that it was a job for them- they are truly excellent hosts. Although there is no restaurant at the hotel, but any time we were in the lobby, they were quick to offer cups of espresso, coffee, sodas, water- anything to make you feel relaxed. Our afternoon and evening coffees led to some truly wonderful conversations with Stephen and Gerrit that were a lot of fun. We always hated for them to end and they were a big part of why our stay in Paris was so enjoyable. Neighborhood: The hotel is in a quiet neighborhood within walking distance of the Eiffel Tower and the Arc de Triomphe. Although, the neighborhood is not strong on nightlife, it is has plenty of bistros that stay open to about midnight or so. There is a small place at the bottom of the hill that we went to a couple of times that was great for a nightcap. The staff there was also very friendly and it was within stumbling distance of Jays. If you are looking for something livelier, cabs are plentiful and the fares are not too expensive. Post-booking. Going back to the airport, Jays arranged for their driver to take us back to the hotel. Making the trip back stress-free. All drivers fees were added to our hotel bill so we did not have to deal with a payment. Once we got home, we received an email thanking us for our stay and the pictures we posed for the day before. Another thoughtful reminder of our stay. From the minute we decided to stay at Jays Paris, it was an experience of thoughtful service. After so many complimentary postings, the expectations for Jays is high. They meet these expectations quite easily. When we go back to Paris (and we will), Jays will be our hotel of choice.", "Date": "August 16, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "3", "Location": "3", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "marin ca", "Title": "\u201cExtremely friendly staff, lovely small hotel\u201d", "Author": "coachapril", "ReviewID": "UR37733569", "Content": "Just returned from Paris where i had the pleasure of spending two nights at the lovely Jays hotel in Paris.

Our room was large and well decorated but was cold at night and after walking all day the only way to warm up was to have a shower or get into bed!!The bathroom was acually warmer due to the lovely heated towel rail. Personally i would rather have a warm room than a 200 year old wardrobe! and at 375 euro per night i expect more than a plug in small blow heater which is clearly not sufficient. Only half of the fixed shower head actually worked which was disappointing and the pull out shower head in the bath had a leaky hose. Might sound trivial i know but this is not a cheap boutique hotel and i thus i would expect the same high standards of luxury hotels.

One option would be to pay for a suite at one of the top 5 star hotels, so that you become one of their \"special\" guests. But in Paris, this costs over 1500 Euro per night. So a better option, unless you are fabulaously rich, is to stay at Jay's in Paris, where for less than the price of a regular room at one of the 5 star hotels you stay in a renovated townhome near the Arc de Triomphe with some of the best service in all of Paris. Jays has a total of 5 rooms. All are generously sized and made of one large room with attached bathroom. Each is individually decorated - and their website gives good pictures of what to expect in each room. I advise looking at the website and finding the style that suits you the most, and also putting in your request when you reserve; but bottom line is you can't really go wrong. The ceilings are tremendously high, the windows grand and plentiful, and the furnishings are unique and luxurious. It is truly like staying in the top level of a 5 star \"hotel within a hotel.\" You do give up the 24-hour room service, the elevator (Jays has 3 levels, if stairs are tough ask for a room on 1st level), the swimming pool and gym, and the in-house fancy restaurant. You get superb 24-hour service though, and at Jays you matter - because you are never less than one of their 5 most important guests. Gerrit and Phillip do an excellent job and really make you feel welcome and important. They are ready with advice, individualized print-outs to guide you, and always there with a cup of tea or fresh coffee in the lovely lounge if you like. And at Jays that coffee or tea comes from one of the most exclusive Parisien gourmet stores - and it is gratis for you, unlike at the 5 stars where every little thing costs an arm and a leg. The rooms are extremely clean and smell lovely. They have chosen Clarins bath products - and a veritable treasure trove of toiletries will await you in the bathroom. The equipment is in top shape, and anything that is amiss will be rapidy attended to by the ever-present staff downstairs. Flat screen TV's with DVD players offer modern entertainment, and again unlike the 5 stars, there is free wireless internet for guests. If you want a break from rich French food and are looking for something in walking distance, ask the staff about Fuxia (91, Ave Raymond Poincare) just a couple blocks away and open late. They serve great Italian pastas and Mediterranean salads and are reasonably priced and delicious. So in summary, if you want to go to Paris and stay somewhere lovely, where you matter even though you are spending 400-700 Euro a night (as opposed to >1500), then look no further than Jays. The level of service far exceeds most Parisien options in the same price category, and the luxury of the room won't dissapoint. At Jays you are never one of the crowd - you are always truly one the most important guests, unlike at the 5-star properties. My wife and I enjoyed our stay immensely and hope one day to return.

Both of us travel often for work, had been to Paris once previously, and found ourselves here for 6 nights in late-November 2008 upon the recommendation of a family friend (with very classy taste whom I'd like thank publically). They recommended Jays Paris, I contacted the hotel directly, Jays took over from there and the rest is history.... Firstly, Jays is home. In fact, we felt more at home in Jays than we do in our own apartment. With only 5 rooms, the staff has the time, knowledge, training, and courtesty to tend to your every need. They are genunine, kind, and experienced. We could go on and on, but it would be pointless to recite the countless times they went above and beyond. Truly extraordinary. Jays' location is perfect. Smack in the 16th, equi-distant from the Arc/Champs and Eiffel Tower, dozens of brilliant restaurants minutes away, a short walk to the metro....put simply, Jays' location has character, is uber-convenient and perfectly located for accessiblity to virtually anything for which you might be venturing out. You would be hard-pressed to find larger and/or nicer rooms anywhere in Paris. We stayed in Suite Louis XVI. Each of the five suites are gigantic by any city's standards - but even more appreciated in Paris - wonderfully designed, and well-thought out in both design and decoration. Our bed was the most comfortable we have slept on since we've known each other. No hyperbole. Amazing. In sum, this is a gem of a boutique with incredibly gracious service, unbeatable location, and unusually large rooms with heavenly beds. With restaurants at every turn, it is unnecessary for the hotel to have an in-house bar/restaurant, or try to be something it is not. Jays does what it does better than any boutique hotel at which I've previously stayed and I suspect they will continue to do the same.

Its luxurious interiors and charming miniature size add up to the warm feeling that you are staying not at a hotel, but at home. The spacious suites with high ceilings are fully equipped for a comfortable stay, so that the tasteful furniture is not only beautiful, but suprisingly functional. Jays' location is almost perfect.

The Sacr\u00e9-Coeur Basilica at night and during the day and of course the museums, the Mus\u00e9e d'Orsay and the Louvre and the Paris by boat lunch. A very quick trip but very nice This was the smallest boutique hotel we had ever stayed at however the service and \"personal\" attention was first class. My wife lost a special bracelet at the Mus\u00e9e d'Orsay on Sunday, we left on Monday afternoon and could not retrive it as the museum is closed on Mondays, Judy arranged for Jays staff to visit the Museum on Tuesday located the bracelet and had it overnighted it back to our home in Texas. We are experienced travellers and we will recommend Jays as a very personal, very special lodging,something that is very hard to find. We will be returning later this year.

The service is truly exceptional and there are so many thoughtful details, there are even little laundry powder sachets and delicious cashmere blankets that are extremely luxurious to swim in whilst relaxing with a book or watching TV after a long day of walking. We stayed in an absolutely divine room that satisfied all of my expectations for a truly romantic and comfortable stay - it was EVERYTHING I had hoped Paris could be. I was particularly concerned about my trip to Paris because I am a coeliac - which means I need to avoid gluten at all costs. We primarily booked Jays because there is a discreet kitchenette just in case I needed to cook my own meals. Being gluten free in Paris is not easy as there is very little information on the internet about where you can go to eat. I contacted Judy because I had little success and wanted to find one restaurant that we could visit for one meal. I was so amazed when she organised a different restaurant for us to experience every night that we were there! It was such a massive relief and such an adventure! She informed every restaurant about my dietary requirements and all I needed to do was turn up and hand them my information. Needless to say - I never expected to get the chance to enjoy Parisian food of such fantastic quality and of such variety! On our last night there Judy made sure she said goodbye to us - and I am still moved when I remember Philippe standing outside making sure that he waved us off as we drove away. You can't buy that sort of care and generosity of spirit and if I ever go back to Paris Jays will always be my first and only choice. Thank you so much Judy & Philippe!", "Date": "September 17, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Bellwood, Pennsylvania", "Title": "\u201cTerriffic Hotel\u201d", "Author": "pjmom45", "ReviewID": "UR8535727", "Content": "We stayed at the Jays hotel 4 nights at the end of June after a 2 week trip thru Italy. This was by far the Best hotel of the entire trip (we stayed at five 3 and 4 star hotels). We are a family of 6, 2 adults and 4 teens/preteens. We stayed in adjoining suites on the 2nd floor. Everything was comparable to a Four Seasons hotel, EXCEPT, the rooms were much LARGER, and it was 1/2 THE PRICE. One room even had a washing machine. Location was great too. It was in a more residential/business area which made you feel as though you were experiencing the real Paris. Good restaurants nearby, especially at Victo Hugo place (5 min. walk) and shopping too. They give you a printout/map when you check in of everthing (even reccommendations) in the area. The Arc de triomphe is 2 blocks away as well as the bus stops. The Eiffel Tower is a nice 10-15 min. walk. Trish and Judy will help you with anything else you could want or need to know.

There was the added bonus of a lounge next door with a fridge and cooking facilities if you wished to use them. The staff went out of their way to make our stay as joyful as possible. They recommended different local restaurants( all of which were fantastic), local markets and interesting streets to visit. The experience was more like staying at some one's fantastic home in the centre of Paris than a large impersonal hotel.

We stayed at JAYS for three nights in June, to celebrate my 40th birthday. We wanted to stay in a luxurious stylish hotel, and yet take our two young daughters with us (aged 7 & 8). We wanted to avoid the 'sofabed in the room' scenario, too often offered to families. JAYS did not disappoint, and we were offered two suites, with an adjoining door, which suited us perfectly. Both rooms were spacious and clean with beautiful decor. We were very impressed with the service received from JAYS staff. They were prompt in answering our e-mail queries before our stay, and were very helpful in booking a table at a very nice restaurant for us. We were made to feel that nothing would be too much trouble to help us with. In particular, we were not made to feel at any way unwelcome by bringing children to the hotel. Although we know that our children can behave when requested, not all hotels seem to welcome them as paying guests. JAYS were very welcoming to us all. We would not hesitate in staying at JAYS again when we next visit Paris.
