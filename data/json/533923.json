{"Reviews": [{"Content": "Great place in the perfect location Just gotten back from Bali and wanted to write a quick note about Villa Kresna. Over our two week trip, we stayed in both the thE sunseT location and the Villa Kresna tropical resort. Both resorts are nearly identical in set-up and offering (even the breakfast menu's are the same), but Villa Kresna Tropical Resort is 20 yards from the beach, secluded away up a little alley. thE sunseT is about 200 yards from the beach - not far, but a for the same price it's better to try and get the Tropical Resort.Breakfast is great and is served at a table outside your suite, the staff are really friendly and the whole thing is very quiet. The rooms all have sat TV and DVD players so that you can chill out before going out to one of Seminyak's great restaurants and bars.We paid $65USD a night including breakfast in the last two weeks of Oct, which was really good value.", "Date": "Nov 2, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR898067240", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "5", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "Spareshirt"}, {"Content": "Quaint little place       The sunset on the beach (2 min walk from hotel)", "Date": "Aug 25, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR736304366", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "3", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "mpuishy"}, {"Content": "COOL PLACE !!!

We were looking for a villa to stay in Seminyak area, and found this group of very small villas. We choosed to stay in one with private swimming pool.The villa decoration does not have any special taste, you can find the same going to Baleare or Costa Brava. It's done with European taste, and does not represent much from Balinese art of creating interesting places.The service was very bad. Each time we called to be served with the included breakfast, we had the feeling we disturbed them (the restaurant is 1 minute walk from the villa).Moreover, after leaving the villa for two days, as planified with the local management, we had the pleasure to find all our personal things put on the ground in the hall. They put them away from the villa when we were not there, despite the agreement that we could leave them there.As a conclusion, we would say that with the price they ask, the design of the villa and the associated service, this is really a place to avoid in Bali, as it shows nothing good from this Island and their people. They think they have a style there, but they have not any", "Date": "Mar 11, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR366421755", "Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "2", "Overall": "1", "Value": "1", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "3"}, "Author": "Flyerfred"}, {"Content": "Mixed feelings about Villa Kresna       Entrance to Villa Kresna", "Date": "Oct 27, 2006", "ReviewID": "UR503244646", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "3", "Cleanliness": "1", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "2", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "3"}, "Author": "*patthes*"}, {"Content": "we loved it!! we stayed in the one closer to the beach, the tropical resort at first fo 2 nights! We ended staying 8! (and got 10% discount for staying more than 7)So what could I say more? I don't know about the sunset village one other person stayed at and didn't like, but the tropical resort was terrific for us. It's not a place you can walk to, I agree but taxis are so cheap and we used them all the time. We stayed in the lotus suite and since we had no reservation we changed 3 times rooms, ad some friends were there so I stayed in basicly all the lotus suite and for a couple wanting some rest it was very nice, comfortable, clean, quiet, peacefull, spacius, decorated with a lot of style!And we thaught it was cheap compared to other places we stayed at! That's my point of view!", "Date": "Jun 29, 2006", "ReviewID": "UR125619598", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "5", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member"}, {"Content": "Not worth it - go elsewhere Villa Kresna has 2 areas - Villa Kresna is next door to the Sofitel Hotel by the beach and Sunset Village is about a 5 minute walk further inward from the Villa Kresna. I stayed at the Sunset Village in the Bromo Suite. I looked at it on-line and it looked pleasant and I really liked the location of it in Seminyak.However, I was not pleased at all upon arrival. First of all, Sunset Village is in the middle of nowhere. Though the website says they are very close to the beach, Oberoi and KuDeTa, the walks to these places are not enjoyable walks at all. You have to walk down these side, narrow roads that can only fit one car going one way, but 2 cars will always try to squeeze through simultaneously. There are also a lot of scooters that will speed by. In addition, you walk past a lot of locals doing construction. I honestly didn't feel comfortable walking alone as a female by these sites. Even when I was with my boyfriend, a number of locals would holler things at me that made me very uncomfortable. Additionally, we had to take a taxi everywhere; even though KuDeTa was next door, it wasn't walkable at all. Luckily, taxis are very affordable and there's plenty of them around. You also are nowhere near any major roads, which was also very frustrating if you wanted to do simple things like laundry, internet, get groceries.The room was very dusty and dark. The room seemed like it hadn't been dusted in ages so we started sneezing immediately upon arrival. The pool was small and didn't look nice at all, we didn't swim in it once. There's also a little pond in front of our room that looked like dirty water that hadn't been cleaned in ages. The security box area smelled like it had been sprayed with a very odorous ant/mosquito killer, which was very toxic. I had to hold my breath every time I opened the box. There are a number of mosquitoes, so we burned mosquito coils nightly.It's very dark b/c the windows are in a row and are high; you cannot tell it's sunny outside from inside the room. The design of the room is very poor.The bed was not very comfortable either, which was on the 2nd floor. The website made it look like there was a huge second floor, but it was tiny and barely fit the bed.The TV in the room indeed does have satellite channels, but it was smaller than the computer screen I use at work. The bathroom was actually not too bad; if you don't mind geckos climbing the walls and a few bugs, the outdoor shower was pleasant. There was one employee that we found to be very helpful - it was the man that cleaned the rooms. However, we found everyone else to be indifferent and lackadaisical. There were times we called the front desk and asked a simple question (where is there an internet cafe, for example) and we kept getting the answer, I don't know. If there was a language barrier, I'd understand, but it was evident the man just wanted to get us off the phone. Perhaps we had high expectations b/c we had just arrived from a great place in Ubud, the Tegal Sari, where the employees were very friendly and helpful. I would not recommend this place at all. I think there may have once been a time that this place was pleasant, perhaps several years back when it first opened. However, it just feels like the place has been forgotten about and unattended to.If you want to stay in Seminyak, spend the extra money and stay at someplace closer to the beach or the main roads (the Sofitel was very nice) and I would avoid the cheaper villas. If you spend an extraordinary amount for a villa, you will most likely get what you paid for, but it's not worth it for these cheap villas that are advertised on the internet.", "Date": "Oct 3, 2005", "ReviewID": "UR640097029", "Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "2", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "1", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "queenbee19"}, {"Content": "Great location and highly recommended I have stayed at the Villa Kresna in Seminyak, Bali two seperate times.
