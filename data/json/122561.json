There was a hole where the linoleum had pulled off the cement and you could see straight down to the cement. It was about one foot around. The heat was lousy. The desk clerk was hostile. I think having an intact floor is not too much to ask, even from a cheap hotel.

On this stay my 61yr old mom and her 75 yr old husband also rented a room here so we could spend the weekend visiting. On Saturday night 4/2/2011 the three of us were sitting outside their bottom floor room enjoying the spring night talking at about 9pm. We were not drinking or loud nor did any other guests call to complain about noise but none the less an armed security guard approached us and told us to take our chairs inside that we were not allowed to sit outside after 8pm. Now don't get this wrong, I understand the hotel not wanting people drinking and raising hell at all hours of the night in fact I don't want that either. And I like the fact they have security to keep my car safe and break up any wild parties but being treated like a child and sent to my room at 9 oclock is no way to treat a paying well behaved customer. The pool area was locked and there were no other places where guests could sit outside and talk except right outside the room so if its a safety thing and has something to do with potentially obstructing the sidewalk they need to provide a place for guest to sit outside when the pool is closed for the season. The security guard with the Gun was very polite but this rule is a deal breaker for me and I will never stay here again and will think twice before staying at another motel 6. I have never had anything like this happen anywhere else but 1 bad apple will spoil the whole bushel and from this day forward motel 6 is tarnished in my mind.", "Date": "April 3, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Sleep Quality": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Jacksonville, Oregon", "Title": "\u201ccockroaches all over\u201d", "Author": "bessnphil", "ReviewID": "UR69225110", "Content": "This was the worst motel I have ever stayed in.

We had made reservations in advance. As expected with a cheaper motel, the place was full of seedy looking characters just hanging out in the parking lot or leaning over the rails. There is security on the premises that monitor the parking lot, so that was a plus. However, I did not feel safe enough to ever stay there with a child again. We would have switched hotels, but there was a convention in town and no other rooms were open. The room was exceptionally tiny, which was also expected for the price. The place was just old and worn out. The sinks in both rooms we stayed in were cracked and covered in cigarette burns (non-smoking rooms), as was the floor, which was also covered in suspicious looking yellow stains around the toilet. The carpets were noticably dirty in the corners and by the bed. The second time through when we arrived there was no one to check us in. We waited a half hour and were about to leave and try the next town when the desk clerk finally arrived. The beds were comfortable, the tv worked, and the wake-up call was on time. It's an OK place to just sleep.
