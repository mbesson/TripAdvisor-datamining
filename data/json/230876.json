The location is perfect, not too far from the central railway station (15mins walk) and very close to the Anne Frank museum. Red light district and other window shopping shops are sort of 10mins walking distance which is not a bad thing if you want a quiet sleeping place. Overall I liked the place and would recommend the place to couples, families or professionals.

There was some street noise at night, staff were helpful, I asked for directions and an extra pillow both were provided without a problem. The Hotel has a nice sunny breakfast room with a resident cat, the breakfast was basic, cereals, tea/coffee, toast, eggs, cheese, the food was tasty and there's plenty of it. The location is good, under 10 minutes walk to Dam Square. I walked to Centraal Station on the day of my departure, took under 15 minutes.

First of all we arrived there saturday morning where we was greeted by a nice young lady who told us our rooms were upstairs (yet again another 500 steps) where we found our double room. At first glance it didnt look that bad until younopened the bathroom door to be greated by a sewage smell,just going for a wee you had to peg your nose unless you was used to bathing in sewage. Went downstairs to the girl on reception only to be fobbed off with the pathetic excuse that the drains were made up! This then followed the blue brothers who came up to try make our room smell fresher in which my 2 year old nephew could have done better. All we got was an air freshener in ehich we could use incase the smelt came back but little did they know that the smell was so putried that it never went away at all. Once this gastly situation had slightly got better only by the use of a hanky over your nose we thought we would take a look round the room only to find out the window wouldnt lock so we had to sleep in sub artic conditions all night with the possibilities of someone coming through the window and robbing us. We then couldnt think our ideal could get any worse but then the bathroom had no propper ceiling, you could view the sky from our bathroom,maybe this reduced radiation from the smell? Dare i say anymore to entise you to this run down mess? One word of advice,dont go there unless you want to become used to the smell of sewage, fear of someone getting in, sleeping in artic conditions or having a gym exercise getting to your room.", "Date": "March 6, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Wakefield, England, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cFantastic location, friendly staff\u201d", "Author": "Jesseyes", "ReviewID": "UR125031431", "Content": "My boyfriend and I visited for 1 night 12th February and I was not looking forward to it after reading the reviews on here.

The breakfast was basic and self service but was fresh and was a good start to the day, the breakfast room was spotless. Ok so the hotel is a little run down but this just adds to the character.

The hotel itself isn't bad, the staff were friendly and the hotel seemed pretty clean too. Yes the stairs are very steep but it didnt bother us as were only staying two nights and we hardly had any luggage. My only complaint was our room. It was very run down. The bathroom was also a little special; the only thing that seperated the shower from the rest of the bathroom was what looked a kids shower curtain so everything got wet and the bathroom flower semi flooded. The TV also didnt work either, but it didnt really bother us. The room also had a musty smell, but again, we didnt spend much time in the room so it didnt bother us. The onky we did like about our room was the view, we just sat by the windows and enjoyed people watching. I think we would stay there again, as the loaction was good (right round the corner from the Anne Frank House & Jordaan neighborhood).

I was unable to use the bathroom apart from a quick pee: even the plughole stank of urine and cleaning my teeth made me retch.

Check in isn't allowed till 2pm but they have a small room to leave luggage in. We went to our room and there were two single beds, a table with two chairs, a television (with BBC 1!), a fridge, a wardrobe (with hangers), a safety deposit box and an en-suite bathroom. If you want a kettle or hairdryer, ask at reception and they will give you them free of charge. If you are going to be staying in your room for most of your trip, book somewhere else, but for somewhere to crash at night time and freshen up in it is perfect. The continental breakfast was fine, two types of cereal, white and brown bread, different flavoured jams and nutella, tea, coffee, orange juice, and cheese slices.

The bathroom flooded when using the shower as previously mentioned and there was no towel or shower mat provided. No tea and coffee facilities were available in the room and when we enquired about this I was advised to wait until breakfast the next day. Breakfast left a lot to be desired also. A loaf of bread, some cornflakes and cheese which looked like it had been sat out far too long. There was no service here at all we just got pointed into the dining room by the reception staff. Half way through breakfast we ended up with a cat sat in the middle of the table, although I like cats, I find this a bit unhygenic. It's a shame as this could be a lovely hotel but I am struggling to find anything positive to say about it. The only good point was the fridge available in the room.

As for the rooms they were pretty bad to be honest, very small and smelly. We had a double room on the side of the hotel facing the canal, which was lovely but the windows were rotting and would not stay open. The whole decor of the room was just horrible dated and dirty. The bathroom was discusting there was no shower basin so when you used the the shower water would fill the bathroom and if you were not quick enough the water was out under the door and into our room. The shower curtain had obviously been brokeen before we arrived and it looks like the staff decided a peice of fishing wire attached to the ceiling would fix it!! And the smell of you not what was constantly lingering in the bathroom. We also had no tea or coffee facilities as stated on the website, When i quereed this at reception i was told to use hot water from the tap!!! seriously??? later on in the evening i asked again and this time was given a kettle coffee and milk with no questions asked. Generally the hotel is in a perfect location its just a shame its so poorly run and the staff at the reception desk were rude and un-helpful and the rooms were just a joke, And for 300euros for 3 nights is wrong for a hotel of this standard, Travelodges in england are far far better than this hotel and they have bigger, cleaner rooms and friendly staff.

I pushed it; the door unlocked without a word from the speaker. Now, Holland isn't known for its hills. Allow me to introduce you to the first one I've met in Amsterdam. A very steep flight of very small steps, with radiused turns rather than flat landings, giving extremely small treads when going round the corners. No help getting luggage (thankfully only a heavy-ish carry-on) up them. I was breathing heavily when I got to Reception on the first floor. I've never before, in any hotel in several decades of travel, been asked for a deposit for a TV remote control! US$20, 20euro or 20 pounds Sterling gone from the spending money already. The desk clerk wasn't quite surly, but wasn't the soul of friendliness either, and his English was only slightly better than my Dutch. My room was on floor 4. Joy. More steep steps; lots of them. My luggage and I sighed, and reconciled ourselves to a trek. Having scaled the North Face of the Di Ann, I discovered one of the hotel's more unique features: a fitted cat - calico, pretty and extremely friendly. She immediately adopted me, and followed me - led me, more accurately - into my room. Suits me, I like cats, but anyone who's allergic might want to give the place a miss. *Cough*. The room stunk of smoke, absolutely reeked of it. Ominously, that was with the window open. I wasn't looking forward to closing it. No, wait, I was - the tram noise from downstairs wasn't encouraging. So I closed it. The noise dropped from unbearable to annoying. I always travel with ear-plugs. This is one of the many times I've blessed that particular bit of foresight. I don't want to think what the noise level would be like on the lowest accommodation floor. I understand the need to preserve an external historic appearance, but would secondary double-glazing really break the bank? Decor was Seventies-vintage wood half-panelling, in a shade of drab. The room lighting was weak, giving it a very gloomy appearance. There's no bedside room-lighting switch, or bedside lamp, so expect to get up again just when you're ready to doze off. The bed was comfortable enough, and appeared clean, although the red stains on the sheets suggested they'd been washed with the blankets once too often. Taking a brief lie-down acquainted me with another decorative feature of the room: the false ceiling, fitted with broken and badly-stained tiles. There were no tea or coffee facilities in the room, nor hair-drying, ironing, nor ... well, you get the picture. The one concession to guest comfort was an in-room fridge that looked as if it had also survived the stairs journey, taking the quick route down more than once. The wardrobe contained an electronic safe, which was locked. I couldn't be bothered to ask for it to be opened; I didn't have a laptop with me, and carried my valuables instead. Given the number of staff in any hotel that can open these safes, I don't consider them secure. Stories in other reviews here suggest I was right to be cautious. To the bathroom, as nature couldn't be denied after a long journey. It's a wet-room, with only a shower, no bath. I'll live. The toilet, though ... only a few inches from the front of the seat to the wall. Anyone with long legs (I'm a whisker over 6ft) or, shall we say, a slightly portly figure will have to sit sideways. Mind you, if they're that overweight, full marks for making it up to floor 4 without medical assistance! Time to turn in. And so to breakfast, the following morning. I've stayed in many Dutch hotels, so I know what to expect at breakfast: a variety of breads and cheeses, maybe croissants; meats; fruit; cereals - you get the picture. Di Ann was a little basic. One (white) bread, toasters that can only burn one side at a time, a few tired-looking and sweating slices of cheap gouda, one cereal - corn-flakes - and some hard-boiled eggs. No fruit, no meat - not that I eat meat - but plenty of overloud music video on the large wall screens. All of this in stark contrast to a well-decorated, nicely-appointed breakfast room. Strange. Back to the room, to freshen up for the new day. I'll say this for the shower: it may be gloomy in there, but the shower delivers lots of hot water at a decent pressure, even on the top floor. The cost of all of this was about GBP 120 (around US$240, or EUR 175 at time of writing) per night. In my opinion, this is very poor value for money. Another reviewer has described Di Ann as being like an overpriced travellers' hostel with pretentions, and I have to agree. I'd only come back if I had run out of options. To be honest, if they fitted the benches in Vondelpark with decently secure safes, and the weather was good enough... Anyone wanting a romantic weekend, who has children, who's allergic to cats, whose money:sense ratio's properly calibrated, etc., you might want to try somewhere else. \"Might\"?

This may or may not bother you (depending on your purpose of visiting), but it is worth knowing. Overall. a great spot to stay with a friend for a couple of days. I would definitely stay again although if i was traveling for romance purposes i would probably spend a bit more and go for something more up market.", "Date": "December 17, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "4.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Auburn, Illinois", "Title": "\u201cGreat View from Room\u201d", "Author": "pupdud", "ReviewID": "UR6149931", "Content": "This was a great hotel for the price.

The bed was not the most comfy bed i had slept in but again it did the job. It was actually two single beds pushed together and it was rather small but i was happy with it and i think most peple would be the same. The bathroom was spot on. The shower was so powerful and we were offered clean towels, toilet roll and soap every morning. Their were no drinks facilities in the rooms but somewhere it stated that these were avalible upon request which is fair enougth really! Breakfast was fine, toast, cheese, cereal and boiled eggs and always enougth to go around the breakfast time wasnt to bad either 7 till half 10.....so still time for a sleep in heh! The housekeeping guys were always hard at work and the rooms were cleaned everymorning. Ours wasnt as we were always in it (late nights!!) The locatation is the best thing about this hotel, and Amsterdam is the most beautiful city. The staff are really helpful.
