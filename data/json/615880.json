Let me tell you that to my surprise the hotel was impressive, from the friendly staff the minute you walked in to the cleanliness throughout the entire establishment, it just smelled clean. You can tell the place was humming, management was on top of their game. I found that they had a restaurant on the main floor called the Tierra Adentro, I tell you the food was to die for. This was right up there, top quisine stuff. I looked no more I found a home. I would highly recommend it to anyone who is looking for a place to stay near by and doesn't like to travel back and forth to San Juan.

This was a nice hotel considering it was the only one in the Bayamon area, and I have to admit...this was definitely a little different than what I am accustomed to in a hotel, but the longer I stayed, the more I was able to adjust.The room was a good size and clean. The bathroom was clean and modern. The view...10 thumbs down! That's all I need to say about that. There was no pool, and the beach was not close by so had it been extremely hot, it would have made for a difficult trip, but the weather was kinda overcast-ish the entire time, so I guess it kind of worked out. The air conditioning....brrrrrrrrrr..was great....very cold or should I say comfortable. Had it been in the midst of the summer when it gets very hot in Puerto Rico, the appreciation for this hotel would have been a plus...lol. The rooms could use some updating though, including the TV and carpet. A microwave and fridge would also be a welcomed plus especially for a diabetic. Certain medications have to be refrigerated at all times. This was he first time I've ever stayed at a hotel that did not have a fridge or microwave in the room. Definitely a challenge. The entire staff was awesome though, so this made up for everything else that was lacking! Luci, the front desk attendant was extremely patient and had one of the most pleasant personalities you'd ever want to encounter. She always had a smile on her face and was most helpful. Maria, who was also a front desk attendant was a very pleasant person. I needed to print out our boarding passes for our trip home on the following day, and she went above and beyond the call of courtesy toget the passes printed for me as well as making our check out process go very smoothly. We had a driver by the name of Carlos who was \"off the chain\". He was our guide to all of the tourist spots and let me tell you, this young man can drive! He was awesome and extremely nice (:). The hotel restaurant was not that impressive, but our waiter, can't remember his name, but I think he is also the owner, was one of the sweetest people I met while there. Very attentive and accommodating. However, on the last day, I finally tried the beans, rice and some chicken wings, and was pleasantly surpirsed. The food was very good, so I guess we were just choosing the wrong eats. Also, if you stay at this hotel, you have gotta try their guava butter spread for the freshly baked rolls. It is soooo good. I pretty much got full off the bread and spread alone. Oh yeah...one last thing....you gotta get the Sangria. The bartender at the hotel makes some of the best I've ever tasted. Still wasn't enough alcohol in it, but it was refreshing (:). All in all, I will definitely stay at this hotel again. We are planning another trip to Puerto Rico, but this time want to stay in San Juan on the beautiful beach(s).", "Date": "May 9, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Minneapolis", "Title": "\u201cVery nice place\u201d", "Author": "AttractionUSA", "ReviewID": "UR94006523", "Content": "We stayed there for a couple of nights.
