Was impressed with the stylish rooms and friendly staff. Stayed in a standard room and a suite and was happy with both, although a sofa or a couple of armchairs would be nice in the suite. However, it was lovely to see the great views from the 7th floor. We had a \"breakfast included\" option for part of our stay, and although I wished there were more vegetarian options, non-veggies will be fine with the selection of meats, cheese, eggs, pastries and fruit available. Best of all its served until 11am. The location is possibly not ideal for a first time visitor to Barcelona, or someone who wants to spend their time in the busy touristy areas, but it is in a quieter upmarket, very pretty and very safe part of the city and we didn't find the location a problem. Quite the opposite. It is about an 8 minute walk to the nearest metro (Diagonal) which is just 3 direct stops to Liceu on Las Ramblas, right at the heart of things. There are plenty of buses and taxis directly outside the hotel which would take you anywhere in the city. It was about a half-hour (pleasant) walk to the Raval and about a twenty minute walk to the cool bohemian bars and restaurants in Gracia. So all in all, I'd be very happy to go back to the Hotel Wilson - they were offering a great deal of 51 euros p/n just before we were there (January 2012) through the hotel's website.

Before we arrived we had looked on the website and had seen that the hotel offered parking through an arrangement with a nearby car park. There was no mention of having to pay for this. On arrival we found that it costs 45 Euros for 24 hours parking! We appreciate that we might have to pay but this is not a small amount and I believe this should have been stated on the website. It is sneaky and misleading to imply that the parking is free when it is actually VERY expensive. In addition the car park is about 10 minutes walking from the hotel. This is a bit of a trek with all our luggage and I would have appreciated if we could have parked out front the hotel and unloaded before going off to park the car \u2013 however this option was not offered to us. We were booked in by a standoffish receptionist and shown to our room. To say that the room had a living room would be an exaggeration (\u2013 a small desk with a chair?). The room was ok. It looked clean but I noticed a few signs of neglect such as hairs in the sink and slightly stained toilet bowl. In addition the bed was not a double but two single beds pushed together. The bathtub was certainly not round. However not being the types to complain we made do. However on the second day I decided to question why our bath was not round as promised. It turned out they had put us on the top floor which did not have a round bathtub but they would move us to a different room if we wanted. The man at the desk was helpful and accommodating and we were placated. Our second room was of a slightly better standard. However again - two single beds pushed together was considered a double (??). A few other complaints: Breakfast was ok. The food was nice but the orange juice was horrible diluted cheap squash. Despite asking on two occasions when we wanted our Cava sent to our room \u2013 they still managed to forget! The lift was a nightmare (stopping at seemingly empty floors, going up when you wanted to go down) and despite being on the 8th floor we eventually decided to take the stairs. When we checked out the receptionist tried to charge us for tax ON TOP of the room charge. I found this outrageous since when I peered over the desk, our booking form was sitting right there in front of here \u2013 clearly stating that tax was included! I corrected her and it was sorted.

Although the overall grade is good, I need to point out two big disappointments; the service and the elevator. The staff was extreamly unfriendly. In fact, I've never experienced such bad service ever in any hotel in any other city or country. I usually don't care if the staff can't speak English very well, but at Wilson, they wouldn't even try to understand or communicate when there were misunderstandings. We're decent people who never get into trouble, but during this stay we were treated as criminals. Especially the night watch was a total idiot. He literally yelled at us for being so loud that the other guests couldn't sleep. It was a Saturday evening and we had a couple of drinks in our suite with music on the cell phone. We were there for one hour. He claimed we'd been noisy the whole night and also the night before. We told him we weren't even in the hotel the night before, but he wouldn't listen. Obviously, if other guests are disturbed, they need to let us know, but it's not acceptable to scream at hotel guests, especially for things they didn't do. We talked to another group at the hotel who'd experienced the same problem. The staff had been yelling at them for being noisy three days in a row, calling their room to tell them to stop partying when they in fact had been sleeping. To add, on the hotel web page, it says the rooms are very sound proof. Also, the elevators took forever and one time we even got stuck. It took the staff 20 min to get us out, and when they did, they didn't apologize for their crappy fascilities or even ask if we were OK.

Good staff too. Big space, private large terrace (for the middle of a giant city) modern and confortable. Surrounded by windows and looking over the beautiful and bustling boulevard below. Very cool. It is several blocks to get to the Metro (which is an excellent way to navigate the city, by the way) however it is a very pleasant walk thru a thriving commercial neighborhood. More of the business/banking district than a tourist area. Which is fine by us. Walk a few blocks in any direction of the hotel and you will find plenty of shopping and restaurants, even a supermarket is a block away. Great breakfast places too.

Sure you can hear the street traffic a little bit. But it does not bother me because I have lived in urban areas in the past. There were no other rooms on our floor so I cant comment on that. The washroom was very modern, clean and private. Only flaw was a tiny leak of water under the shower and onto the floor of the bathroon, nothing a 5 minute sealing job wont fix .. hint, hint. Loved Barcelona, great hotel as a base. I give is a Very Good only because I am a hard marker on hotels.

We managed to use the Aerobus from the airport and got off at Plaza Universidad to catch the 64. From there we had to walk a few blocks. Street names are not very visible so its helpful to know what the surroundings look like. Use Google Maps for this! The hotel is very close to great shopping - Zara, BCBG, Blanco, Loewes and more.

We also took advantage of the large pedestrian/biking pathway that sits in the middle of the main road separating traffic.

If you are going to use the tour bus, buy your tickets at a discount from the front desk. Our room was a standard room on the 5th floor facing the back of the hotel across what seemed to be a small architect school and church.

The room itself is very small with a small desk, lounge chair, mini fridge with drinks for purchase, closet and safe box. The safe box uses a key that you have to obtain from the front desk.

We were out early and the bill was ready and accurate. There was also internet access from a terminal in reception. As mentioned in one TA review, the hotel reception is not spacious. However, I cannot see why this might be an issue. It seems preferable to have a large well appointed room and terrace in preference to a brightly lit, but wholly unfunctional entrance space. The hotel is situated midway between two tube stations and takes a good ten minutes to walk it. Not completely desirable if you have heavy cases so we would recommend a taxi.

The bathroomdoor was of glass, so it wasn't quite handy given the fact that we were 1 girl and 2 boys - but we made it work. The staff was friendly and ready to help and answer our questions. The location of the hotel was great! It is definetly in the luxurious end of Barcelona. It was a ten-minute walk to metro Passeig de Gracia from where we could take the train to placa catalunya where all the action happends. Placa Catalunya is 20 minutes away by feet if you like walking. The weather was great so we didn't mind. Also if you like shopping than this area of the town is absolutley perfect, with all the high-end shops being close to the hotel.

They also checked us in with no hassle eventhough we arrived at 2 hours earlier than the check in time. We were happy with the rooms we have generally, although for the double room, we would have liked a little more space. Otherwise it was a comfortable and clean room. The bathroom is clean although it could do with a good scrub with bleaches at some corners, in the room we were staying in. The staff were very friendly and helpful. As we bought the Bus Turistic vouchers, we could hop on and off the buses, according to the routes provided. About 10 minute walk away, there are stops to pick up tourists on the Red Route. Otherwise, there are a lot of taxis around the area, and from reviews from other travellers, there are also buses you can take to the central locations. There is also the option of walking - from some of the tourist spot: roughly about 30 minutes away from Casa Batlio. Good to check out before hand where to go for food: we found Maitea Taberna, which is about 12- 15 minute walk from the hotel - a great value restaurant serving the best local food in the area. You can find reviews of the restaurant on Trip Advisor. We picked up breakfast from the pattiserie around the block. In cost about 40-45 Euros on the taxi to the airport from the hotel. It was well worth the money for 3 travellers. We booked a shuttle with Thomas Cook for our return journey to the airport for 55 Euros.

Having read previous reviews, I was aware that it was not directly in the centre or on La Rambla however the stylish boutique style appeared worth the walk and, after all, isn't that the best way to see the city!! The hotel is situated on a gorgeous, tree lined avenue, with many stylish shops and restaurants either side. It only took 5 minutes to walk to the nearest metro, Diagonal, which is only 1 stop away from all the action although we actually only used it once (when our feet were quite tired from walking) - choosing to walk to La Rambla which took approx 30 minutes (but a lovely walk). The reception area is very modern however we found reception staff to be less than helpful and quite rude to be honest - no welcoming smile unfortunately which I think goes a long way. The porter was excellent however, showing us to our room, and wouldn't hear of me wheeling my own suitcase there! Every time we returned, a porter was waiting who called the lift for us, a nice touch. The room was very modern with a very stylish interior. The bathroom area was quite open (fine for a couple however I wouldn't feel comfortable sharing with anyone other than a partner/very close friend) and a nice selection of toiletries provided. We also had a lovely balcony overlooking the main street which was really pretty however, due to being on the main street, the traffic noise was quite loud, though not particularly an issue. Aside from that, the room was rather basic, quite small and basic. The bed also wasn't overly comfortable however in a city like Barcelona, who wants to lie in bed?? I'm also a little confused how this can be classed as a hotel as there is no restaurant/bar. The only reason I can think that they get around this is by offering a self service whereby you can help yourself to some drinks/snacks and inform reception of what you have consumed. As we didn't take breakfast, I can't comment.

The room was spacious and nice, we have ordered twin beds and there were two single beds. But after the breakfast (breakfast were ok) we were told to leave that room and change to \"our\" where electricity problem had solved. New room was not prepared after breakfast and changing rooms were planned on standard check-in time after 2pm. Of course, I argued with that option but i was told to pay extra money to stay in that room or all my staff could be easily put off and bring to the new room by housekeepers. I approved this changing, and option that my staff'd be removed by housekeepers and went to the town. At the evening, i found out (my staff was carefully removed, its no complaints at all) that the new room had a king size bed. But we needed the twin beds. Head of the reception told me 10x time sorry, but there no free rooms with twin beds in standard category rooms, and if we want, we can pay an extra to return again to that first-night-suite.

I argued with manager on duty but did not want to make a scandal after listening million time how he was sorry about it and did nothing i approved new room and asked for another blanket. Of course, two next nights weren't comfortable at all, and it spoiled the whole impression of that hotel. Location was bad.

However when we got there, we didn't find it a problem at all. In fact, we took a taxi from the aerobus drop off (placa catalunya) and it was only 5 euros up the street to the hotel. From then on in, we walked everywhere and avoided the metro. During the hotel we visted the Ramblas and to be honest I'm glad we were a little outside the main centre as that place is so busy. So my big point is please don't be put off location - it's actually in a really nice area, surrounded by good cafes, bars, restaurants and a little park. The rooms are clean, and all face out onto the Diagonal. Rooms have a safe and you can get the key at reception. They didn't have BBC world service on their tv, so if you like a quick news fix in the morning before you head out I hope you can understand Spanish. Free wireless is available, but if you haven't brought a computer, they have one with free access on the ground floor. We stayed for 8 days and found staff friendly and helpful, they will phone to book tables in local restaurants if you can't speak Spanish - which was great because at the weekend you need to book ahead for a good restaurant. Hotel breakfast was 12euros each so we give that a miss and headed to local nearby cafes for a morning coffee and snack. The 27 bus stops right outside the door! and will take you to Sants railway station in 10 minutes. From here you can easily take a day trip to Stiges which is beautiful.

Second thought goes to staff: seems everyone is new or every problem seems new to them.

We had picked the Wilson as it had good reviews and we love Boutique style hotels. The price was excellent. The room was a good size in relaxing creams and browns. There was a 32\" LCD on the wall although we never watched it. There were several options for lighting including a dimmer switch over the bed which was nice for tired eyes. There was a fridge in the room with a well stocked mini bar and we thought the prices were very reasonable. The bathroom was modern with a nice rain shower head but no bath. The only thing i would complain about was the door to the bathroom was a sliding one and wasn't very sound proof...so make sure you know your partner well!!! A proper hairdryer was supplied so you needn't take your own and there was a diffuser attachment. We had a room overlooking the main road but the windows were very soundproofed and it was very quiet. We had a little look at the suites when the maid was around. She was more than happy to show us. Very large rooms and a bath, but for the time that we spent in the room we didn't think it was worth the extra. We didn't need to use the reception staff for anything but they seemed friendly enough and leant us wine glasses for the room so we could kick back with a nice bottle of red after a long days walk. We took the laptop and used the free WIFI in order to plan our days out, really handy. Getting to the hotel from the airport was easy. Turned right outside the airport doors and took the Aerobus in to the centre for about 5 euros. We then took a taxi to the hotel another 5 euros as we didn't want to wait for the number 7 bus but that would have taken you right outside the hotel. On the way home we heard the reception staff mention the Aerobus were on strike and when we enquired they said a taxi would be 40 euros. We decided to take the Renfe train which cost 2.60 euros so if we went back we would use this method instead, Really easy and straight into the terminal. If you do stay here be prepared to walk! It was probably a good 30 minute walk to the centre of things so we varied our route every day so as not to get bored by it. However we enjoyed exploring the back streets. On 2 of the days we took the Bus Touristique which we hopped on at the roundabout near the hotel. Great value for money and meant we got our bearings easily. We used this to see most of the sites and we loved the ability to hop on and off at leisure. We also had a nice stroll to the Sagrada Familia from the hotel through the Gracia district. We didn't have breakfast in the hotel but there were some nice coffee shops around the hotel in which you can get a coffee and croissant for under 2 euros. We ate on the Rambla de Catulunya which wasn't far from the hotel and had several restaurants and bars which come alive after dark and are great for people watching. You need to try the Tapas and Cava! We have decided that we will definately return to Barcelona as it was one of the best cities I have ever been to. I could ramble on about the things to see but there is just so much.

We were visiting Barcelona for the Fiesta de la Merc\u00e9 y had a difficult time finding a hotel to accommodate three people. The hotel is a bit far from the city's attractions and is situated on one of the city's prime shopping/financial avenues but we loved the hotel. The rooms are tastefully and thoughtfully decorated, showcasing the artistic vibe of Barcelona. The beds were very comfortable and the room surprising spacious. The bathroom had a bath (very nice when traveling with a toddler), a strong shower, hairdryer and nice toiletries. The room itself featured a large, flat screen t.v. with many channels (not that we were there to watch t.v.). The hotel is situated on a busy street but the rooms are soundproofed and have shades that allow for sound sleeping. You will have to walk a bit to get to the city's attractions, however. The main desk was more than willing to help us navigate the bus system from the hotel and the city's attractions. We didn't go for the buffet breakfast because it seemed a bit pricey and we haven't had much success with Spanish hotel breakfasts. The hotel also has a small business center with a computer and printer (free use). I would certainly return to the Wilson Boutique Hotel and you should give it a try!", "Date": "October 12, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "wales", "Title": "\u201csuper\u201d", "Author": "WalesPudding", "ReviewID": "UR46157810", "Content": "Contemporary chic hotel-room compact but stunning.
