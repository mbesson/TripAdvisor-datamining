{"Reviews": [{"Content": "Pedregal Palace Giving this hotel an average as I am not sure how it exactly compares to other hotels in Mexico city (I would rate it higher than the Hilton Airport though).After staying in the airport Hilton (very convenient but expensive) the people I was working with suggested the Pedregal Palace as a more convenient location for them (since they were driving me around).I had no reservation but they gave me a room for 920 peso per night (plus got hit with a 138 peso and 18.40 peso tax). The room was on the top floor (6th), queen bed, desk, couch and large bathroom. They also had an in room safe which I had to ask for the key for. TV that sometimes had bad reception but was not in the room that much to really care.Also ate at the restaurant quite a bit and everything I had was excellent, even compared to what the Mexican guys I worked with called authentic Mexican food (I really liked their tortilla soup). Service in the restaurant was excellent (they would even give me the remote control for the TV..lol).Would recommend this hotel just for staying at, have no idea if it is pratical for location, took about 35minutes from hotel to airport at 430AM (230 peso). Not that far from the University area/Olympic Stadium.Only two things I did not like was that with no car (although I would not want to drive around in this city) I was told not to wander on my own around the hotel (not even to the grocery store 1/2 block away) and even though I was using my calling card I got hit with a 5.75 peso charge for each time I called long distance (to me that seems steep).The hotel website can be found here------", "Date": "Mar 6, 2005", "ReviewID": "UR346976365", "Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "3", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "TCalgary"}], "HotelInfo": {"HotelURL": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g150800-d154654-r3254483-Pedregal_Palace_Hotel-Mexico_City_Central_Mexico_and_Gulf_Coast.html", "HotelID": "154654", "Price": "$109"}}
