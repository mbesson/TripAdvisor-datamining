The location is excellent, not even 5 minutes from the Rialto bridge (also convenient when coming in with a water bus) and again not 5 minutes from San Marco square in the other direction. Check in and check out both went smoothly and all enquiries posed to the staff were handled quickly and courteously. We had a deluxe canal facing the canal which was spacious with a large bathroom. I liked that extra bedding and pillows were provided because i normally always have to request this at hotels. The beds were very good. There is no iron in the room. One night reception arranged for my dress to be ironed but it cost \u00e2\u201a\u00ac8, so rather iron at home or travel with wrinkle free clothes. We booked a speacial romantic arrangement which included breakfast in bed, prosecco, and tickets to the casino..definitely worth it..we spent an enjoyable evening at the casino although without the tickets i am not 100% sure we would have made the effort. The only 1 let down was that one morning our breakfast in bed order was not collected and only after 10 minutes of waiting we looked outside and realized this. I called reception and they immediately sent someone over and we got out breakfast very quickly. I think how a hotel responds when something goes wrong says alot. The water is not drinkable but i would advise getting water for brushing your teeth etc outside the hotel. We paid \u00e2\u201a\u00ac5 for 750ml in te hotel and \u00e2\u201a\u00ac1,50 for 1,5l at a normal shop. All in all i would definitely use this hotel if i have the pleasure to visit Venice again.", "Date": "April 5, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "skopje", "Title": "\u201cexcellent location\u201d", "Author": "kiki b", "ReviewID": "UR125835227", "Content": "I had a wonderful time in Venice ,you have also contributed to it.

A bit of old charm but not too old that its eery. The bed and pillows were amazingly comfortable,so good that we wanted to sleep all day! Though i found an ant each day on the bed it didn't really bother me too much.The hairdryer included looks like a vacuum cleaner attached to the wall, it wasn't the best and the shower was a bit small.We also had another window in the bathroom that overlooked the roofs of adjacent buildings.American buffet breakfast was included and it wasn't great but you could dine at a window next to the canal and the view was great.The hotel also has a bar at the front reception area.Location was about halfway between San Marco square and Rialto bridge.We found it very convenient to get around and explore.Staff at the hotel did the bare minimum,when we had a problem with our remote for the TV the man who came to fix it wasn't too happy.I wouldn't say they were helpful at all when we enquired about tours so we just decided to go out on our own.

Reception staff, however, looked like buffoons when they told us on behalf of the manager that we had to sign a 'declaration' that we were satisfied with our accommodation. Would you sign? We didn't because: (1) We had booked with lastminute as a topsecret hotel, which provided a discount but not a vast one. What we got on arrival was a suite on the first floor of a building 100 metres away. Access to our room door could be obtained by any passerby through the unlocked front door of the building and by entry through a permanently open 'security' door which the hotel knew was broken but didn't fix. The accommodation was therefore insecure. Reaching it up a flight of stairs open to the public without staff present made it potentially dangerous for women travellers; (2) The suite, although beautifully furnished and decorated, attracted numerous mosquitoes even with windows closed. The hotel had to be asked to place a device in a plug socket to reduce their number. Why wasn't this already in the room? It might have saved me the trouble of hunting them through the night after being bitten every few hours; (3) Breakfast was, as a previous reviewer warned, mediocre. Particularly cheap touches included taking away the fresh orange juice machine & providing the lowest quality fare; (4) We were told that it is illegal to use an iron in your room. The hotel wanted 20 euros to iron a dress. Does anyone else believe that ironing your own clothes is a criminal offence? (5) We asked for an alternative room and were shown a cramped, stuffy one on the third floor only minutes after the reception staff had falsely and preposterously insisted that a fire had closed it off. When we declined this even worse alternative one staff member insisted that this was the only option as we had 'refused all others', only to change his mind after a few minutes. His superior then shouted at him for allowing us not to accept the third floor room and tried, unsuccessfully, to insist that we take it. I am a lifelong fan of slapstick buffoonery but would rather have seen it on stage at a fraction of the price we paid for it here. Moral: go to beautiful, sleepy Venice with mosquito repellent. See it all within three enjoyable days. Don't stay here unless paid for by someone else who does not care about value, service or quality.", "Date": "June 8, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Athlone, Ireland", "Title": "\u201cToo Good to be true !\u201d", "Author": "threeline", "ReviewID": "UR62958151", "Content": "Fantastic Hotel, brilliant location right in the centre of San Marco.

As described this hotel is in a perfect location, two minutes from Rialto bridge and St Marks square. The rooms were of a fair size, we didnt get a view at all, just an inside wall, but there were shutters on the windows and black out curtains, which meant we had some really good nights sleep. The American breakfast consisted of cheese, ham, toast, croissants, scrambled eggs, frankfurt sausage, fruit and yoghurt. Which wasn't bad at all, but dont go expecting a full cooked breakfast, cause you will be dissappointed. The reception staff, as all the staff in Venice were quite rude and expressionless. We didnt like the way someone had to check our room before we were allowed to leave! Apart from that go for the location, but search around to get a good deal on the rate.", "Date": "April 6, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "1.0", "Location": "5", "Service": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "Wilts UK", "Title": "\u201cIf you want to meet thoroughly rude staff, this is the place.\u201d", "Author": "VMTraveller", "ReviewID": "UR60004912", "Content": "I popped in to ask the price of rooms for future reference.
