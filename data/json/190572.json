It's on a busy street, but has a fairly low key street presence (the taxi driver had a bit of difficulty in finding it). Reason being that the lobby is quite small, and you have to move upstairs to the first floor to locate the restaurant, conference facilities etc. Price wise, there are better deals to be found in Madrid if you shop around, but this was a business related trip and the hotel was booked by the local business partner (at a discounted rate, apparently). Room quality was good but (am I alone in this ?) two single beds pushed together does not constitute a double bed or a double room. The bathroom had both a shower and a bath (rare enough in hotels these days) as well as a decent selection of freebies. Room safe (free) is provided, with usual minibar and wall mounted flat TV. Also, there was a stylish looking radio / music system but which didn't appear to have an ipod dock (just one of those little connections, where you have to bring your own lead - which I didn't). Buffet breakfast was very good - particularly the fresh orange juice. Now my gripe - internet access has an extra charge, and no free wireless. Why can bars and cafes provide this as a matter of course, but not hotels? Otherwise, Vincci Soma has many positives. It's right beside a Metro stop (Goya) and not far from the museum belt. Shoppers will be pleased with the array of well known stores in the immediate vicinity (including two branches of El Cort Ingles).

I'm still amazed that rooms this size are allowed. - Although clean the rooms and particularly the bathrooms look a bit \"old\" you could say run-down.

Even the hard wire system in the room did not work. The heating system was horrible. I needed the fan on to mask the noise of the street at night, but even at the coolest setting the air blew out hot. I had to leave the window open while working even though all I heard was street noise below. The TV was old and remote did not work some of the time. I found the staff somewhat gruff and rude, even in the dining room. Granted this is the city, but smile and be friendly, like your team in Valencia where I am now. Also they did not have one English newspaper. Even the smaller ones in Rioja had the International Herald Tribune. And one more thing, make sure the toilet seat can stay up. The aim gets a little harder in the middle of the night!! As some of my readers in the past might know, I generally do not give out negative feedback but in this case I have to let people know that this hotels needs to invest some time in an upgrade in its finishes as well as in its electronics and technology.

Unfortunately the experience this time was not so enjoyable. Despite requesting (several months in advance) a similar room to the one I'd had before I got a smaller room at the back of the hotel and on a lower floor. I was told it wasn't possible to change. Seems being a returning visitor doesn\u2019t get you any favours. The single room although small and with a view of next door's drying laundry was clean and had a safe (although no iron). The bathroom just had a large shower but was spotless. Unfortunately I had to request soap and shampoo on the second day and toilet roll the day after as housekeeping didn\u2019t replace them. There\u2019s free WiFi in the hotel but the signal in my room varied between very weak and mostly non-existent. The TV quality was very poor although this was also the case on my last visit and seems to be a problem throughout the hotel. They should sort this out. I also noticed the carpets on the third floor didn't look too sparkling. Not necessarily a problem but can be indicative of general standards in the hotel. All the above were minor irritants but just about bearable. The dealbreaker was the nightclub next to the hotel. I\u2019d noticed this on my last visit but it didn\u2019t affect me as I was on the 6th floor. This time I was on the 3rd floor and never got any sleep on a Thursday night until the disco ended in the early hours. Very wearing. The walls were pretty thin as well so I was more aquainted with my neighbours comings and goings than was strictly necessary. If you can\u2019t guarantee a room on a high floor I would seriously consider another hotel. On the plus side the staff at the front desk are very friendly and helpful. They even understood my poor Spanish and would switch to English when I struggled. The rates aren\u2019t too bad and the location in Barrio Salamanca is great. Once you been to Madrid a few times it\u2019s the ideal area to stay in. There\u2019s a couple of El Cortes Ingles department stores nearby. There\u2019s very few tourists around and the bars and restaurants are very good. There\u2019s also plenty of metro stations and getting to the airport costs just a couple of Euros.

Initially, I was a bit concerned about the hotel's location since it seems to be situated away from Puerta del Sol. However, after having stayed there for 4 nights, I now feel that the location of this hotel is probably its strongest asset. It's along Calle Goya and within immediate vicinity of a Metro station, a bus route, supermarkets, department stores and some fine eating places. As a result, it is within a 10-minute ride to Puerta del Sol without the noise and bustle accompanying it. The room facilities were more than adequate - with a very comfortable king-size bed, strong airconditioning and strong & hot water in the bathroom. No problems encountered with the free WiFi which was accessible from inside the room. Self-service printing was easily available on a 24 hr. basis from the hotel's well-designed library on the 1st floor. Reception staff were approachable, professional, efficient and helpful - particularly in providing directions to sites, suggesting bus routes, etc. The hotel is clearly marked from the outside - though it has quite a narrow facade and its lobby is small and not very well-lit. Some suggestions for improvement: a) Provide an electric hot water thermos + free coffee sachets in the rooms. A number of hotels provide this for free. b) The stereo equipment takes up almost half the writing desk - which makes it less comfortable to set-up one' s laptop. c)", "Date": "June 9, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "mallorca", "Title": "\u201cHighly recommendable\u00a1\u00a1\u00a1\u00a1\u00a1\u201d", "Author": "SophieMallorca", "ReviewID": "UR108334722", "Content": "Highly recommendable\u00a1 Location is excellent, room and restaurant absolutely wonderful\u00a1\u00a1\u00a1 We were surprised by the variety and quality of the breakfast.

The location is terrific -- the Salamanca neighborhood is lovely, smaller streets, beautiful architecture, lots of shops, restaurants and services. Yet it's still close enough to walk to all the major sites. it's just a few minutes to the Retiro Park and maybe 20 minutes to the Prado and Thyssen. I easily walked all the way to the Palace and back, but for those who don't walk much, there is easy metro access. We liked the area much better than the hotels that are in the mobs of tourists around the museums, Puerta del Sol etc. The positives about the hotel? The price is right , the rooms are well-kept and decorated in a modern style, free wifi worked perfectly, and the 2nd floor breakfast room/restaurant is very nice, especially in the daytime when huge windows let in lots of light with a nice view. The breakfast buffet is excellent (it was included in our rate so I don't know what it costs a la carte) and the service at breakfast was very good. Plates were removed quickly and buffet offerings were kept filled and tidy..and were never felt rushed. The adjoining bar area is nice for a relaxing chat. The places to improve? The entrance/lobby is like entering a dark cave (first impressions count!) and we never found the front desk staff to be terribly warm and friendly. They certainly were not rude, but we didn't feel any \"warm embrace\". For example, we asked for a map, but no one went the extra step of opening it up, circling the hotel, etc. (That did happen in subsequent hotels in Spain on this trip.) The rooms (I assume we were in a standard room) were quite small, with a ton of stuff jammed in (the nice work desk was half covered with radio/stereo equipment!). You might want to spend a few dollars more for some space. Our room faced an interior courtyard, so it was quiet, but also very dark; think about asking for a room facing outdoors. And last but not least, the room was stifling! We had the air conditioning on at all times, but it never got cool -- don't know if it was the time of year (late March, maybe the system wasn't switched over yet?) or what, but many of the conference attendees said the same thing, so it was not just our room. We probably would not return to the Vincci Soma, but a lot of that has to do with the fact that Madrid's hotel rates are much lower than London, Paris or Rome and you can get higher quality for what we think is still an acceptable price.", "Date": "April 19, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Stuttgart, Germany", "Title": "\u201cvery relaxing\u201d", "Author": "Delbert53", "ReviewID": "UR104402427", "Content": "We booked a standard room at the Vincci Soma for our last day in Madrid. Upon arrival we were told by the friendly woman at the desk that all the rooms had been taken, so we were upgraded to their last available room. An older gentleman behind us, whose job appeared to be to carry bags, seemed concerned that we were getting an upgrade, with the desk clerk telling him it couldn't be helped. I didn't understand what the man had to do with my check-in, but as we received the key and headed to the elevator, he made no attempt to take our bags and simply pointed to the elevator. Actually, I always prefer to take my own bag, so this was ideal. The room was incredible....a junior suite, perhaps...outside terrace on the 9th floor with automatic awning, lanterns that could be lit at night if you had the votive candles, amazing shower and separate tub. Having been exhausted by all our walking through Castilla-Leon the prior week, this room was an oasis for us. The \"problem\" was that it was so comfortable, we couldn't leave it except to head out for food/wine to bring back and enjoy w/a view of the Salamanca district. The king-size bed was so comfortable, I slept for nearly 12 hours. I was happy the check-out was at 12:00. Needless to say, I returned to Germany fully rested. Check-out was smooth and friendly, with a young bellman storing our bags and later taking them outside for us, pointing the way to the Goya station. The hotel's location is great, especially if you're headed to the airport the next day(s). Catch the Goya line across the street with one change to the pink line, and you're at the airport, in 30 min. and for 2 euro (including a 1 euro supplement at the airport).

I recommend this only for location, and it's not a flea-bag hotel", "Date": "December 11, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "3", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Atlanta", "Title": "\u201cBASIC AND CLEAN\u201d", "Author": "ChloefromGA", "ReviewID": "UR46745315", "Content": "Wanted a safe neighborhood and close to the metro, and this hotel did it. The room at the top floor was very quiet... althought the first night, the neighbors next room made quite bit of noise till 3 am. Soft, clean and fresh bed everyday, clean and efficient showers. We used the free internet computers in the library (which was almost empty during the day) to get in touch w/ everyone at home. Decor is very basic (felt like a hostal more than a hotel) but we just came to the hotel for sleep and shower anyways. TV with local and foreign channels, stereo, hair dryer, toiletries, fresh towels daily, and room safe (very useful). We had a nonsmoking room but cigarette smoke lingered in the halls and rooms... perhaps from old times or unrespectful guests... A great simple sandwich shop and cerveceria across the street, el corte ingles next block, Zara and H&M clothing store (in case of emergency, ladies ... so affordable, chic, fashion) right next door to the hotel. There is also a pharmacy that is open 24hrs... all these within 2 blocks. About 20-30 min. walking and metro ride to Puerta del Sol... a little inconvenient if you need to stop by the hotel couple of times a day. We went to a bullfight (Plaza de Toros) walking from the hotel.. in about 30 min. - or direct metro line 10min. or less.

Free internet in the library and nice cafe/resturant. They even have a mini gym. Staff is freindly and helpful. The only downside is that if you are a light sleeper the noise from the nightclub in the basement is rather loud. I stayed on the 3rd floor and you could really hear it esp. on Friday and Saturday up until 6am! I'm happy that I sleep rather soundly despite the noise and only noticed it on Saturday when I woke to a particular song! All in all it was fab and I suppose if you want to go to a club, it would be quite handy to have a boogie next door.

We were very nervous about staying at this hotel because European hotels that have seemingly high stars on sites such as these generally have tiny rooms and nothing special to offer. Vincci SoMa shattered this notion in every way. One of the best things about this hotel is the LOCATION! Don't stay on the loud crazy tourist filled Gran Via and Centro Madrid, stay HERE! the barrio (neighborhood) Salamanca in Madrid is like the Gramercy Area/Murry Hill Area/Upper East Side of Manhattan, very, very chic. It is also close to the Goya Metro stop (connects you easily to any line, it is so simple to use, I live in NYC and often found myself in awe at the ease)so within 15 minutes on Madrids Great metro you are in the city's center with all the tourist and hot spots. Then you can return to your hotel which is on quiet but beautiful tree lined streets with stores from Gucci, Blvgari and Prada to H&m and Zara, you really could simply explore the area of the hotel and have a great time. In fact the bus tour goes through the area the hotel is in because it is so nice! For a great affordable price we had a nice spacious double (queen sized) room that was beautifully decorated with simple, chic decor. From the closet to the bathroom, no detail goes unnoticed. I loved how simple the decor was, but it was chic, not dated at all like some \"simple\" hotels in the USA with furniture that looks like it should have stayed in the 70's. The staff was great, spoke perfect english, and were always willing to help us no matter the time of the day. The cleaning staff did an excellent job cleaning our room and whenever we passed them in the halls they had the biggest smiles and the friendliest greetings. Only con, tv is small, and only had two English channels that were bbcnews and cnn-UK. But, that is good since you are in a great city so go out and explore! Free Wi-fi internet in the hotel made up for it so bring your laptop and easily plan your days out or stay connected!We had a nice room on the 8th floor so didn't hear any noise from the street or other rooms!!

Style: a fairly minimalist hotel, but with lots of lovely touches. The staff there were very friendly and helpful. Rooms - our twin room had plenty of space for us both. Big wardrobe with lots of storage and a safe. Great big bathroom with amazing shower and a good deep bath, and some nice toiletries too. Beds were really comfortable with crisp linen. Good flat-screen wall-mounted TV (with a couple of English language channels) and a lot of other space beside that. Nice style to the room - good lamps, and felt modern. Food - we didn't eat there, so can't say. Facilities - the only one we used was their left luggage room (free!) but they had a pleasant library, bar and restaurant. Cleanliness - absolutely spotless Privacy - very private. We couldn't hear anyone, and it was well insulated with double glazing from the traffic noise outside. Presumably the air conditioning in the summer means that the windows can be kept closed then, too! Location - really handy for the Goya tube, but this isn't in a central part of town so if you want to get to a few bars/cafes then you have to travel. If you want to be able to just \"pop out\" to some nearby bar hopping then you'd probably have to pay for somewhere more expensive to get the same level of quality. The area is a nice area, though, close to the Parque del Retiro for a lovely 20-30 minute saunter over to the Prado.
