I would definitely recommend this hotel and would like to visit it again if I go to madrid. Even though not located in the city centre, there is a very good transportation service. Just 1 minute from the hotel, bus No. 162 takes to Moncloa in about 15/20 minutes. Frequency is also quite good, about 5 buses every hour. Fom Moncloa Metro station there are trains to the city centre of madrid. I was amazed at the metro system of Madrid, very developed and there were no delays or cancellations even on weekends like we have here in London. I found Madrid very interesting and lively place. People are very friendly and helpful. Language is a bit of a problem, its a good idea to learn few spanish words beforehand. I would certainly recommend this place and would like to visit again.", "Date": "November 24, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "4", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Bangalore", "Title": "\u201cWarmer\u201d", "Author": "29SP", "ReviewID": "UR28915024", "Content": "Good for family on europe tour and can cook their food themselves.

I was a bit disappointed in this place, as we had previously stayed in much nicer hotels. The decor of the hotel looks like it's stuck in the 60s. The lobby was a dark green color and my room had a pink bathroom - pink sink, pink bathtub, pink toilet. I had a single room and it was average size for European standards. The bed was outdated, and I could feel the springs against my back. The location was pretty good. Just a short taxi ride to Plaza Mayor. If you are on a budget, this is a sufficient hotel, but otherwise, I would stay away.", "Date": "February 2, 2009"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "NH La Florida Aparthotel", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g187514-d234305-Reviews-NH_La_Florida_Aparthotel-Madrid.html", "Price": "$59 and up*", "Address": "<address class=\"addressReset\"><span rel=\"v:address\"><span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">Procion 12</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:postal-code\">28023</span> <span property=\"v:locality\">Madrid</span></span>, <span class=\"country-name\" property=\"v:country-name\">Spain</span> </span></span></address>", "HotelID": "234305", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/ProviderThumbnails/dirs/91/4c/914cecb2622f590ffad71b09fe5049dd1large.jpg"}}
