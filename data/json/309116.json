{"Reviews": [{"Content": "Give it a miss..... I stayed at the Oranjje as part of a group of Malaysian university students on a field trip to Bali. We were originally booked into a hotel in Kuta, but some official busybody interfered and insisted that the group move to this hotel as it was safer than staying in Kuta, following the very recent executions of the Bali bombers. Safer ??? We were right next door to the US Consulate. A target if ever there was one... The hotel was a half hour walk from the beach at Sanur or a short taxi ride. It was a bad location but as we used coaches to get around it was not a problem to us. The accommodation was basic, I would say 2 star, although it was clean. We were told this place was 4 star and that we had been upgraded... Yeah ! Comedian ! Breakfast was clammy noodles and rice every day, thank goodness there was toast and jam and endless tea and coffee. There was quite a bit of refurbishment going on and the place sure needed it. It had the appearance of not been maintained for the last ten years. I got the impression it had been renamed at some time, even the sign board was tacky. It may be cheap but I would never consider staying there as a tourist, although it served us well as a group location, bearing in mind we accompanied a group of students on a tight budget.", "Date": "Nov 30, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR874444204", "Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "2", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "2", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "1"}, "Author": "GordonToulson"}], "HotelInfo": {"HotelURL": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g297694-d309116-r22333737-Oranjje_Hotel-Denpasar_Bali.html", "HotelID": "309116", "Price": "$87"}}
