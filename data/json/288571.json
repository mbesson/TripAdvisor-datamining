The level of massage offered by the pool was exemplary and very reasonable for 1/2 to 1 hour full body massages. They were professional in every way. This area of Playa del Carmen is quiet so we didn't have to listen to Blue Lagoon and the other noisy places further up the strip. There is a bigger bar next door and it shuts down very early. Walking along the beach and eating at various beach restaurants provided plenty of wonderful food and drink. I took a Magic Bullet with me as I like Margaritas so made them in the room and put it in a small thermos as the drinks were quite expensive and not the best Tequilla!

I have stayed many times in last 10 years. I have been to Playa Maya, Grand Porto, Fusion, Royal, Grand Coco, Las Palapas, Illusion, Aventuras Mexicana, Azul 5's, Petitte Lafittes, Luna Encanta, and lots of AI's up and down the coast. The aforementioned hotels are all good or good enough and have lots to offer. However its my purpose here to let all who read this know how good this small beachfront hotel is. It is older but in good working condition. The staff are efficient, friendly and competent. Its a well run, safe hotel with a great location and view. The pricing of the rooms I feel cannot be beat for a beachfront hotel in Playa. I had a beachfront room and could look north on the beach all the way to Gran Porto and south to ferry pier to Coz. Its a wonderful way to wake up. (rooms face east.) Some peopelo coplain about the noise coming from the all night beach club at the other end of the beach (Blue Parrot) but the volume at the All Riviera end is muted somewhat and your airconditioner will drown most of it. The beach club, Bad Boys is right beside the room I had...next door north, but their band only plays on Thurs and Saturday nights from 5 to 9. Its a fun to enjoy this busy spot and with your room right next door, you dont have to endure the Bad Boys washrooms or the drunken greybacks that inhabit the site.The location is remarkable and there are plenty of places to explore and eat and drink nearby. The All Riviera's beach club seems to be run by Mario who is congenial and hustles to please. Staying here allows free beach chairs and it doesnt hurt if you offer to buy Mario a beer to have with you. So to wrap this up.....The All Riviera Hotel is a remarkable value that allows access \"right on the beach\" Unlike some of the hotels that you get a \"view\" of the beach.(or in some cases no view) I heartedly recommend this hotel.

I was a little concerned because older reviews were not great. They must have had a management change or something because it was clean, staff was great and good service. The price was great when I booked on Bestday.com. The first thing I checked for was bedbugs, as I do at all hotels. There were none. There was also no noise problem or anything wrong with the room. For a beachfront hotel, you can't beat the price. It was very nice, with good size room, A/C, fridge, pool and Miguel at the front desk was always nice. As a woman travelling alone I felt very safe there and safe even out walking at night. I have stayed at four or five other hotels in Playa del Carmen, some were mediocre and others were good--Intercontinenal (different name now) ***, Labna *, Hotel Delphine ** (good but not beach front), Mimi del Mar*** right next door. All Riviera was the best for me with the combination of price and amenities. The only issue I had was that it was the low season there and local people struggle to make much money during the low season. The waiters were polite, but I really didn't want to pay tourist prices for food or drinks, so I felt bad for them when I turned down invitations from them to get drinks there. I hope to return in May and next September and I will definitely stay at All Riviera. For those interested in saving some money, don't pay $40 or $50 for hotel shuttles at the airport. Go to the Ado desk at the airport and take the local bus direct from Cancun to Playa del Carmen for $10, 2 blocks away from All Riviera. Book your return trip to the airport a day or two before departure at the bus station. Very important to check what terminal your return flight is on. You need to know this in order to get off at the right stop from the bus. Most people get off at terminal 2. I did this one time and it was a problem because the shuttles between terminals were not good. I usually fly US Air and leave from Terminal 3. Easy, but you have to know which terminal you need. One other word of advice is to stay away from the time share people, unless you want to spend hours of your vacation with high pressure sales people, who have you hostage at their resort. They will eventually bring you back, but for sure a waste of time.", "Date": "October 6, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "North Las Vegas, Nevada", "Title": "\u201cTop little hotel with the real Mexican Hacienda Feel in Great Location\u201d", "Author": "Rooboy59", "ReviewID": "UR64021242", "Content": "Arriving late at night, I stayed here for 9 nights in Rm 206 and although first impression was a bit on the down side, once I actually got into my room on the second floor and had a look around and then opened the door to the balcony, my mood changed to the positive. the hotel was exactly what I wanted instead of a big fancy resort, it had a real Mexican feel about it. It's not perfect but it's very functional. Being right on the beach with the distant lights of Cozumel in the distance made for a great spot to have a relaxing drink after a days travel from Jamaica. The views of the beach during the day were always good too not that I spent much time doing it as I only needed to take ten steps to reach one of the lazyboys or tables set up by the beach crew every morning to start a lazy day soaking up the sun with a constannt supply of Coronas or anything else one wanted. One morning I woke to the sight of a Celebrity cruise liner barely 750 mtrs off shore where she stayed all day, very impressive sight. There is a ferry terminal to Cozumel a few minutes walk up the beach and is defifnately worth the 35 to 40 min trip accross, especially if your a diver or just luv the water. Back to the resort, it is just a 100mtrs to 5th Avenue where you will find every conceivable type of shop available plus a massive range of restaurants and eateries and everywhere you can get a drink till the wee hours of the morning. Dont be afraid of exploring the side streets either for interesting places to eat and drink. The staff at the hotel are very friendly, even if their English is not the best, you will be looked after and not left wanting. The wireless internet is only accessable from the lobby but there are two comfortable lounges to use and being a small place, I never found it difficult to get a spot. Not exactly high speed but reliable. To balance all this I would say that the pool could be a bit cleaner as it appeared cloudy for all but 2 days but then I didn't use it with the beach right there but some family groups used it daily. The other slight negative is the onsite restaurant which although provides good service with ok food at good prices, could use a spruce up, again the staff are friendly and obliging. The hotel next to the Riviera to the left looking out to sea, has a banner called the bad boys club, they have a band play Thursdays and Saturdays from about 6 to 10pm, don't expect any sleep during this period but you wouldn't want to because the band is excellent and plays a great range of 60's and 70's mainly rock n roll and the drinks are cold and food are well priced. the rest of the time I found the hotel to be fairly quiet with little room next door noise as the norm. So, in a nutshell, I would stay here again anytime, Playa Del Carmen is an awesome place and with all the history of the Mayan civilization in easy reach, the ruins etc and the general atmosphere, the cleanliness of the whole place and the people, I would recommend this as a must do destination. finally, the hotel offered every 3rd night free and a continental breakfast so it was a good deal overall, there are cheaper places I know but this one lived up to what I expected and then exceeded them. Happy travels and hope this helps, enjoy your stay in a taste of paradise ! PS: $12USD 1Hr massages just around the corner in next street are awesome or there is one right on the beach in front of the hotel for a few dollars more !", "Date": "May 13, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Toronto, Canada", "Title": "\u201cgood deal for this price range\u201d", "Author": "Julia71", "ReviewID": "UR63109803", "Content": "My husband and I stayed there for a week.

Still, I have to say that for this price ($82 US per night, 3rd night is free) it is a very good deal. I would give this hotel 5 points if not the breakfast. I agree, you cannot expect any miracle from a Continental breakfast included in the price, but come on - serve orange juice made from a powder in Mexico - that's a total disgrace!

College students might love the fact that there are bars on either side of the hotel. We had the oceanfront room. It has a patio with chairs. The problem with this particular space is that staff and tourists feel it is a passageway to the next bar. It is clearly a separate and meant to be a private space that is not respected. This may be a welcoming addition for those that like to party, it did not work for us. The location is ideal for 5th Avenue and the Cozumel ferry station. Also, the beach in front of the All-Riviera is short. Do not expect to have any space between you and whomever. Now let's talk about the noise. It was endless. Typically the bar next door would start blaring music starting at about 10 in the morning. The music would play well into the early afternoon at a fevered pitch. Again, if you are into partying all day/all night All-Riviera is for you. Also, the bar next door on Thursdays and Saturdays has live music from 4-8PM. What this boils down to is very little quiet and a lot of endless frenzied activity. The room does have a fridge that works. The local phone did not work and the cable tv had so much interference that it was basically unwatchable. We reported this but no action was ever taken. There was an afternoon we returned to the room to discover there was no water in the bathroom. The shower is a weak stream. There is a sliding glass door in the room. There is no air or windows except for a small one in the bathroom. We put a stick in the sliding glass door to allow some breeze into the room at night. We thought it would be safe to keep the door open 4 inches at night. At about 3AM we awoke to a man shining a flashlight into our room. The door was secure but our privacy was not. This complaint may be one for the books. If you want to sit on the beach in front of the ocean, staff will ask you for 200 pesos or you are encouraged to eat and drink for the day. (One mother and daughter complained and were able to get reimbursed from the front desk.) We refused to pay. Why stay at a resort if you are not allowed to use the beach front property. You can be on the beach but you must be in the second or third row of chairs. The breakfast is adequate but you are never sure what time it will be.

So for them to sick the cops on us, after our miserable stay, and robbing us and room 204, and others, is so completely wrong, and I don't see how they sleep at night. When we arrived back to the states, I called International Vacation.com Inc. (who booked our stay with All Riviera), I explained what happened and that I still had not been contacted by the Owner. So she called the Hotel, and called me back saying that she spoke with the Owner and said he did speak with us and that we lost the key. He NEVER spoke with us for 3 days that we waited to speak to him.

The beach bar/restaurant is a 'locals' place- meaning it seems to cater to vacationing Mexicans and other Central Americans. We liked feeling a part of the 'locals' scene. The beach took a hit from the rain while we were there and was rocky by the waters edge for the second half of our stay- but there was plenty of fine beach for swimming not far off in either direction.

The AC was loud, curtains had holes in them, glass was shattered, the bathroom was below par, bed was uncomfortable and looked dirty. We knew that there would be no phone and limited TV channels, but I thought those would be the only \"drawbacks\" that we would be happy to live with. But no, this place was no place that was worth $130. I would not give this hotel a single star rating. The only saving grace of the hotel was that it was literally right on the beach. However, in Playa all beaches are public, so forget privacy and quite and peace. There was music blasting right next to the hotel, the roooms looked unsafe, etc. It looked as if anybody could just walk in. We could only tolerate this hotel for 2 hours. I was not expecting an all inclusive quality, but I sure was expecting something more than a shack. Believe all the bad reviews you read here and do not stay at this hotel. We moved to an all inclusive resort for merely $40/night more and had a blast. If you are not on a budget, don't even consider this hotel.

Each morning we were able to order anything we wanted from the breakfast menu and it was included in the price of the room.

There was no bathtub, just a shower and we had no problem whatsoever with hot water. The water pressure was perfect. The rooms are decorated simply with white walls, but the sink and fixtures in the bathroom were made decorative mexican tile. All of the rooms have oceanviews with either a balcony or patio (if you are on the first floor). We did not get in the pool, but I'm sure it was refreshing and it looked very clean. My only complaint would be the bed. The mattress, at least in our room, needed to be replaced. It was completly sunk in the middle and VERY uncomfortable. My boyfriend and I were huddled to each side of the bed, trying not to sink into the middle. I woke up both nights we stayed there with a backache in the morning. I'm not sure if all of the rooms are like that or not. Also, I'm not very keen on using the comforters in hotels. We tossed ours on the floor as it was pretty filthy. I'm not sure how often they clean them. It didn't matter though...we left the sliding glass door open at night with the ceiling fan on and it was the perfect temperature to sleep with just the sheet. We talked about it and would probably stay here again. The location is ideal, right on the beach and only a few steps from Avenida 5 (5th avenue)...the pedestrian mall with shops and restaurants.

We had booked our reservation 5 months before travel for a 3 week stay, had a confirmation number and made a down payment. When we arrived our room was not available. No manager to talk to (never saw one the entire stay) but were finally put in a small corner room for the night. We did get our front ocean view room late the next day, after many trips to the front desk. There are only 27 rooms and we don't know what the maids did all day. They were on site but our room was never cleaned until late late afternoon. We would return from the beach to clean up, relax and siesta before dinner and the room would be dirty. We would end up on the balcony when they cleaned the room at 4:30-5:00. Sheets were changed once a week, pillows had black mildew and smelled. Hot water and water pressure were not constant. You would be soaped up in the shower and then have to try to rinse off in a cold dribble of water. Many times we had NO water and would have to wait 1-2 hours before we could clean up. Beach chairs were to be provided free to guests but the waiters would charge you if they could get away with it. Beach chairs were broken with torn filthy cushions. Hotel guests were banished to the back rows with the prime water front chairs held for people the waiters could rent them to. Waiters were very rude to hotel guests and tried to overchange us several times for food/drink orders. We ran into many people who arrived with a confirmed reservation and were told the hotel was full - no room for you. Room prices are all over the place.

We talked to people who stayed there in 2005 and they had the same problems. Others had reservations but had no room when they arrived. When we learned that things had not improved, and if anything were worse, we decided not to stay there again. We spend 2-3 weeks in Playa every year.
