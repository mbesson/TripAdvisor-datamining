{"Reviews": [{"Content": "Don't even consider this option I only wanted to make reservations and the two people who answered the phone where extremely rude and patronizing.  They even started shouting at me claiming that I should make reservations 3 days earller, not before. They wanted me to pay the whole bill in advance and they wanted me to go over and pay it there.... no bank accounts or nothing, just go there to the hotel and pay all the nights in advance. Needless to say, I won't even consider staying in a place where you can't get a decent treatment over the phone.", "Date": "Jun 17, 2006", "ReviewID": "UR607805259", "Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "2", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "1", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member"}, {"Content": "Come to the \"Both Worlds\" resort If it is the same good 'ol Ambos mundos, I loved this Motel, this is where I found true love, Don't be mistaken, this is a cheap yet comfy motel for couples in love...clean , discrete, and that's itIt even has a cafeteria/restaurant where the chicken soup is great.If I was a tourist on a budget , I wouldn't mind staying there either...It's on a busy avenue, but don't walk around, it is not the best neighborhood though.
