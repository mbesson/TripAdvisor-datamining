It is near a street (Salle) that has some nice pricey shops but very far from getting to the sights. Buffet breakfast is decent enough. one very very negative thing for us is the wi fi. there is a complimentary wi fi connection in the lobby, but they only give you 30 minutes! they will issue your room one user name and password. so that means only 1 device can be connected. so for a party of two, that means you either share your ipad or you limit each usage to 15 minutes each. or if you need to connect 2 devices (say your iphone and ipad) - there is no way you can do that. a big negative for us.", "Date": "April 19, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Cumbernauld, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cAccomodation\u201d", "Author": "Keith506", "ReviewID": "UR127346065", "Content": "The hotel is situated outside the walls so taxi charges from airport on meter all the way and was 65 Euro's.

Air conditioning was fitted but won't be operational until June (we were told), so the rooms got quite warm at night. Breakfast: very basic. No decent tea or coffee (all from vending machines), the only hot dish at the buffet was scrambled egg. Although the volume was plentiful - and the cakes were very good - the range was somewhat limited. Area: actually very pleasant - lots of boutiques nearby, a very good cafe/bar across the road and several good restaurants within a couple of minutes' walk. Connections: Good.

Rooms are spacious and clean, bed was very comfortable, bathroom well equipped with towels and toiletries etc. Even had a clothes line over the bath if you needed one! Our stay was bed and breakfast and there was plenty of food available, the scrambled eggs were some of the best I've had. The hotel bar has a 'happy hour' from 5pm to 7pm with 20% off drinks. There is a 6 euro per night city tax charge per room payable on departure. All the staff were really helpful, check in was swift and easy, and nothing was too much trouble for anyone. If I had to say a negative it would be that there is no tea/coffee facilities in the rooms, and I do like a cup of coffee as soon as I get up, but they do let you go down to the restaurant when breakfast is being served and bring one back to your room so not so bad. A special mention would have to go to the poor man on reception (didn't get his name) when we checked out, we made him work hard when we settled our room bills. We stayed in room 706, nice room, not double glazed so you do hear some noise from outside but nothing that would keep you awake unless you're a really light sleeper. Going back to public transport, the number 53 bus stops close to the hotel and will take you straight down to the Coliseum, (bus tickets are sold in the shop very near to the bus stop) or if you want to go to Vatican city, then turn right out of the hotel and the turn right again on the first junction where the tram lines are, and a short walk down you can get a number 19 tram that will take you there.

They told us that at night there is only person there. The good thing about his hotel is that is is a few blocks away from Villa Borghese. Termini Railway Station is not that far from the hotel. If you take public transport from The Cinquecento Square, you can rely on the 38 and 92 buses as they both go along Via Po, which is less than 5 minutes away from the hotel.

Another 10 minutes to the Colosseum. It is located at the north-east side of Villa Borghese, a large park in Rome. Given its location north of the city center, it is substantly less expensive than other hotels closer in. We spent four days here and generally we would walk to the city center, walk around all day, and then take a taxi back which cost about 10-13 Euros for the family. It is close to a bus stop which can take you to the Vatican for a euro each if you are comfortable with taking the busses (we always cabbed it). The hotel is showing it showing its age and needs a facelift. Elevators are tiny (like 2 people stuffs them) and bounce at every stop which made certain members of my family take the steps. The common areas are nice but a bit faded. The breakfast was free and a simple continental breakfast with a few hot items. Nothing elaborate. Internet was around 10 Euros a day. The rooms are cheaply furnished and decorated. Imagine a Hampton Inn or Fairfield Inn Property which has a few years on it and you will get the sense. Not bad, liveable, but definitely not close to 4 star by US standards.

It's just a short stroll away from the Villa Borghese Museum, where you can catch a ride on the park \"train\" to Pincio near the Piazza Republica. Inside the hotel the amenities are fine, and housekeeping standard is good. The breakfast at the hotel was plentiful though not luxurious.

The hotel was clean and the staff very friendly. The front desk staff were exceptional in answering my questions and helping with exchanging money and where certain things were located. Wi-Fi is available for 5.50 euros per day (which is cheap compared to other hotels I stayed at during my trip throughout Europe). Although the rooms were small, they were very clean. And besides, who goes to Rome to hang out in their hotel room? We were only in the room to sleep anyway, so size did not matter. You do have to put your key into the slot inside the room to keep the lights on. We asked for two keys so that we did not have to worry about one person going out before the other and the remaining person stuck in the dark! The toilet flusher was a little funky as you could hold the handle down to flush for as long as you wanted. Took a while to figure that out! There are a ton of restaurants and cafes all around the hotel for lunch and the staff were very friendly and the food was great. Down one of the side streets by the hotel there is a market where vendors hawking all kinds of items set up shop. They start shutting down around 2 pm so get there before then. it is a perfect place to stroll back to the hotel after having lunch and do a little shopping. The only complaint that I have is that the hotel is really not close to anything. It should only be a about a mile from the Villa Bhorgese but that only brought you to the zoo entrance.

I feel like this is the least you can do to is add this as an inclusion.

I know this is not your responsibility, and it\u2019s the tour operator, but a little initiative would be amazing. All in all, I wouldn\u2019t stay here again. It is not because of the staff.
