We could hear casual conversations and coughing from another room. We were there in April 2012; the weather was warm with cool nights, but the temperature in the room was very hot. Opening a window was insufficient to cool it down, and the hotel was unable to provide us with a fan. The beds are very hard, not at all comfortable - unless you like that sort of thing. Be sure to ask for a queen or king bed if you are a couple. We initially got two twin beds. The front desk moved us the next night to a room with a queen.

First, we walked in and we were not greeted by anyone at all. We walked up to front desk to check in and the girl at the front desk ( Neriman was her name) and again she didn't greet, her first words to us were \"passports\". My husband handed her his passport and credit card and her response was, I didn't ask you for a credit card. Her tone was rude and condescending to say the least. When booking reservation, we indicated that we were arriving at noon and would need an early checkin. They had our reservation completely wrong, not only did they want us to wait two hours for room but they also didn't have the room we requested available. We had two rooms reserved, one for myself, my husband and two children (ages 2 and 4) and one room for my in-laws. The room that was intended for myself, husband and kids was the one not available and they wanted us to take a room with two single beds (twin size beds). The manager was very nonchalant and rude and basically said that is what is was and we could take it or leave it. My husband was furious and ended up having an arguement with front desk manager. After contacting our travel agency and hotel manager they apologized and immediately upgraded us to a suite. The room and hotel itself was nicely decorated and very cool for the historical aspects within the actual facility but the customer service was nonexistent. So with the check-in behind us, we get to the room which was spacious and clean however the room was so HOT! Apparently there is central heat and air but it is controlled by the front office and they were running the heat. The day we arrived it was 18 degrees celcius (about 64 farenheit) The thermometer in the hallway read 29 degrees celcius (84 farenheit) so I can only imagine what our actual room temperature was! When we asked if there was any way to just stop the heat, not even turn ac on just turn heat off and their response to us was \"what if someone is cold\" Not wanting to argue, we just left it alone but we were miserable! For the first time in my kids lives they had to sleep stark naked and with windows wide open. Because of where our room sat, we were in between four walls so there was NO air what so ever blowing into our rooms and we were right under restaurant so with windows open, not only did we have heat issues but we had to deal with dishes and silverware being washed and put away in the wee hours of the morning, on Sunday night til almost 4am in the morning! My kids developed heat rashes on their backs and necks and I was so hot that I got nauseous and sick one morning. My family and I travel quite often and we have never been so uncomfortable in any hotel like this ever. The unwillingness of hotel staff to try to accommodate us and the uncomfortable temperature made our stay miserable. This was our second time in Istanbul and we would never ever recommend this hotel to anyone, in fact, had we not booked thru a travel agency and all expenses already paid, we would have left and stayed somewhere else. The only decent treatment we received was from the cleaning crew, the bellhop and restaurant staff. Front desk staff and managers are a joke and we have spoken to our travel agent to never recommend this hotel to any of their customers again. This place was not worth the money or the aggravation! The only positive thing I can say about this hotel is that the location was very good. Close to Grand Bazar and not a far walk by foot to the Blue Mosque, Topkapi, Hia Sophia and good restaurants.", "Date": "April 16, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "roma", "Title": "\u201cwell run hotel\u201d", "Author": "vincenzo s", "ReviewID": "UR127851836", "Content": "I stayed in this hotel last week.

While solo, I had the pleasure of staying here for 3 nights and had a day room for one day. The accommodation was on 3 different sets of dates. I am a regular traveller and work in the service industry, and while I don't really care to stay in a 5 Star establishment, I do expect certain things of a hotel: Cleanliness, Security, Location, Friendliness ( - and preferably with staff who speak English). The Antik Hotel ticked all the above boxes. And came with some bonuses!- lovely hot and cold buffet breakfast served on the rooftop with lots of sunlight and ocean views; the room was quiet and peaceful. This is probably attributed to the fact that the hotel, although loacted within a 5 minute walk of the Grand Bazaar, is tucked neatly into a peaceful side street just off the main road. The rooms on all the 3 occasions I was there were very clean. If I see hair or mould, it really does leave me miserable. None of that here. And no musty smell. The beds were nice and firm, sheets on them were very well pressed and very white in colour. And the decor of my room - very fresh, and light colours ( white/citrus yellow-green -mustard hues). I'm not sure about the the decor of the other rooms on the other floors, but I was on the first floor. The staff were very friendly and helpful; Zumir (Spelling?) the hotel manager was very helpful in connecting me to an excellent tour agency who handled my excursions out of Istanbul and helpful in every other way during my stay there. The housekeepers were lovely, bringing up an iron with a nice smile everytime I asked for an iron. There was one occassion when the housekeepers had gone home, but I was still brought an iron to my room by someone else. The doormen and waiting staff were also very helpful and lovely. All the staff spoke English well. I have heard of certain hotels in Istanbul where security is an issue eg. where someone knocks on your door wanting to sell you things etc...As I was a girl travelling solo, I was particular about this aspect and would highly recommend this hotel to any girl travelling on her own. What else can I say except that I don't usually write reviews but this hotel impressed me. It is good value. I booked my hotel upon arrival at Attaturk airport and the person whom i booked my room through over the phone was extremely helpful and informative.

The kids loved the chocolate milk. Highly recommend to order the fresh orange juice; the small surcharge (rest of breakfast included) was well worth it. The staff was generally friendly. Main strength of the hotel is its central location, on a side street off Ordu Cd, where the main tram line passes. And that is a great way to get around, at a really good price.

The rooftop hotel restaurant is great and has a very nice view, but overall the hotel lost some glare from the photos on their website. Do not be disappointed! Services at the hotel are great - including the transfer from and to the airport. The only thing that was really annoying was the wi-fi internet connection that was obviously too bussy with other users and required logging in every few minutes or so... I would not go back to this hotel or recommend it to a friend because there are some quite nicer locations - for example in the vicinity of Haghia Sophia. Also I don't think there are much other rooms in the hotel that could be as nice as the Marmara Suit. If you choose to stay at this hotel be very cautious about the exchange rate when paying the bill! Room prices are stated in euros (EUR) and than converted to turkish lira (TRY) - which is also the currency that your credit card will be charged in. After my bank sent me a credit card bill I discovered that the hotel did not use the EUR/TRY exchange rate of the day I was paying the bill. They used a much different exchange rate from one week ago!!! Since all credit cards make a conversion with the exchange rate on the day of the transaction, my credit card bill was 40 EUR higher than the EUR amount stated on the invoice. As I inquired with the hotel manager, he told me that they use the exchange rate of the day of arrival! That is weird but not true in my case. I arrived on Monday evening and they used the exchange rate from past Friday when I payed when leaving next Saturday,,,, That is a really cheap trick to earn some additional money on exchange rates!

I booked the hotel using their web-site and the hotel offered free one-way transfer (either from or to the airport). We preferred to be met at the airport and brought into the hotel as we were having a late flight and it was our first time in Istanbul. The transfer service worked great, we were met and delivered to the hotel. The building is located at the back street which is not very clean, but it is just half-block away from the nice large street with banks, exchange offices and tram stop. It is close to Grand Bazaar and Beyazit Camii. It takes several tram stops to go to Sultanahmet and Galata Bridge. I guess, one can walk this distance as well, but I was with an elderly Mom and we usually took the tram. The room did not have any view - there was a wall of the neighboring building just half-meter away from the window; it did not bother us, as we just slept in the hotel. The room itself is small, but has all necessary things. The bathroom is VERY small, so big people may have trouble using it. The room was kept exceptionally clean though, the towels were changed daily. There were no bath robes, but were slippers. There were soap, shower gel and shampoo in the bathroom. However, sound proofing leaves much to be desired - we could hear voices and sounds of steps, etc. from the next room. Breakfasts were okay with good selection of food. Unfortunately, the front desk stuff was not really friendly. I tried to ask them how to get to some attractions and they were reluctant to answer and advise. Most frequently they just advised to take a taxi. Overall impression is quite good.
