I checked in in the evening and it was the only room left in the hotel. A lot of the hotels in town were already booked or overpriced. They gave me a room for $65 in the building 2 doors away. The old building smelled of urine and rotting wood but the lady at the desk assured me that the room was clean. Anyway, it was fairly clean though it smelled a bit and the room was on a slant facing downwards. The room was a cubbyhole and so small that u could not open the door all the way because the bed was in the way. There was no coffeemaker or faceclothes. There was a teenyweeny hair dryer mounted on the wall and an air conditioner and tv, which was kind of hard to watch because it was on a bureau that was on a downwards slant. Just like the hotel itself-going downhill all the way. In the morning, ta da!! Breakfast was served in the cramped dining area and it consisted of horrible bitter coffee( I wonder if they wrung the coffee out of an old dirty towel) , orange juice, milk, and a cold croissant with a packet of strawberry jam( no other flavor was offered). I decided to give them a second chance and stayed a second night hoping to get a better room and was given a much larger room on the main floor for $65. The room has a carpet that was a bit worn and again, no coffeemaker and only one facecloth for a double room. There was the TV and airconditioner and a bistro table with 2 badly stained chairs. The bedspread stunk of bad body odor and I changed it around to the other side and it smelled better from that end. The bedspread also had some cigarette holes in it. I awoke the next morning to itchy red blotches on my skin and they looked like bed bug or mite bites. They went away in a few days. The same lousy breakfast was served in the morning and they seriously consider giving their coffeemaker a good cleaning as well as the hotel itself. This place is no gem. I would not stay there again if it was for free! I am sure the cockroaches would feel at home here.", "Date": "August 31, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "1", "Sleep Quality": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "2", "Service": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Ottawa, Canada", "Title": "\u201cBed bugs.

I went to my room, pulled back the sheets to inspect for bed bugs, and saw a few critters scurry away from the light.

He didn't believe me at first - he insisted that a mother and daughter had stayed the night before, and asked that we head upstairs to check the bed. I found additional dead bugs under the mattress. He finally decided to refund my money, and I stayed elsewhere that weekend. The bathroom had hair all over the floor and sink, and the carpet was also dirty.

The Village, gay community quarter, is just 5 minutes away. Half-an-hour walk from the centre of downtown. The breakfast continental includes just croissant, juice and coffee. I would recommend the hotel to backpackers and tourists. The staff is friendly, they helped us with a cork screw (there is not any in the hotel and they asked for us in the nearest hotels), they always warned us about parking rules and provided us with useful information about the city. The drawbacks: no elevator, the upstairs seem to be unsafe, the hotel is a little bit filthy. The charge is on check-in for all the nights (which contradicts booking.com reservation policy for this hotel). There is no free parking, so you should find a free place in the street in accordance with city policy and re-park your car almost every day, which is ammoying.

I did so because I read some not-so-bad recent reviews on another website (booking.com, which I used to book this hotel), and boy, am I happy that I followed my insticts. There were two us in a large room with high ceiling and two double beds. Everything was clean and spacious, and that was all we were looking for. We were on the top, third floor, and there were no elevators, but I didn't mind. I mean, the whole hotel is kind of old, and they use old fashioned room keys, but the emphasis here is on clean, spacious and close to Latin Quarter, where most of the screenings of Montreal Film Festival took place (and were there for this film festival).

When I got there the first day with my friend, they wanted us to pay upfront the whole period she was staying (10days) and they said they would refund her for the nights if she was going to be outside of Montreal or something. She had to argue with them how many days she was gone, cause they didn't keep track properly themselves! That neighbourhood is full of ---. No joke. One night my bf accompanied her back to her hotel and the guy behind the desk didn't allow him to enter her room (???). He was rude and drunk and violent! He chased my bf out of the hotel with a baseball bat. My friend got scared and stayed the night over at my place.

There were holes in the wall from electrical work. The toilet obviously hadn't been cleaned in several days. The shower was too small to turn around in - and the door didn't shut - in the shower or to the bathroom itself. We were afraid to go barefoot anywhere in the room. It had a stench too. We couldn't open any windows because of the air conditioner. Not that we wanted to - there was some kind of abandon house behind us. The fire escape had at least 20 bags of rotting garbage piled on it. The back door which was just outside of our room was not locked. All in all it was a dirty little hotel.
