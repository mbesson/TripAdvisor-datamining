{"Reviews": [{"Content": "Loved the Hotel Grand Palace What a fantastic hotel! Clean, comfortable, modern very helpful staff and great restaurants. I would highly recommend staying at this hotel and will definately be staying there when Im next in Tokyo. Although it is not located right in the centre of Tokyo it is 2 minutes walk to nearest subway station and there are always plenty of taxis waiting. We found the staff incredibly friendly and helpful, nothing was ever too much trouble. There is a fantastic Japanese Tepanyaki restaurant on the 23rd floor which is a must! It offers amazing views over Tokyo! The breakfast is good, there are a few shops in the lLobby as well including a massage service a barber and a gift store. A great place to stay in Tokyo!", "Date": "Sep 25, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR692521616", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "EloiseTBrisbane"}, {"Content": "Good hotel in excellent location.

Lobby was really huge although seems quite worn off. Hotel was clean from the lobby, rooms and dining areas. Location was near subway stations although I would advise getting personalized tour packages to be able to offset any unfamiliarity with the place and the language barrier that often presents itself with. Lots of convenient stores , fastfood outlets and vending machines just outside the hotel. Breakfast buffet was decent though the western cuisine choices doesn't seem to impress. I like the bread selection and what seemed like cheese made to look like candies. Rooms are quite small but well lighted and functional. Would agree with other previous reviews that the room temperature can't be controlled. Room amenities impress me from the unique room slippers, toiletries , bathrobes etc. Toilet utilizes a different technology and shower was really good. What made my stay really comfortable was that majority of the staff speak good English . That was indeed a relief for someone who doesn't understand Japanese.", "Date": "Mar 4, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR535364649", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "doctorfoxtrot"}, {"Content": "Good hotel in Tokyo Stayed at this hotel during a vacation in Tokyo. The Grand Palace Hotel is not in a prime location although it is conveniently located around 5 minutes walk from at least two subway stations. Depending on whether you walk left or right from the hotel entrance, you will end up in either the Kudanshita or Iidabashi station.The hotel has a grand and spacious lobby which is reminiscent of the 1970's. The rooms also appear to be a bit old though these are clean and well-maintained. It has the standard amenities which you can expect to find in most hotels (toiletries, bath robe, etc). The only problem with the room is the centralized airconditioning. As we stayed there during spring time, we didn't have the option of having cool air. They had the heater activated and it was a bit warm. The staff are friendly and polite. They know how to speak English and guided us with the nearby areas. We were recommended to visit a nearby area where people were viewing the cherry blossoms as well as a shrine also nearby. We visited the latter without knowing what it was. It was only later when we learned that it was the controversial Yasukuni Shrine. We had a breakfast buffet in the hotel which consisted of a sumptuous spread. Both the variety and quality were very good.Overall, I would definitely stay in this hotel again when I visit Tokyo in the future.", "Date": "Dec 14, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR837153309", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "ACChua"}, {"Content": "Very Good Tourist-Class Hotel The Grand Palace is an excellent tourist-class hotel, with an above-average location for travellers and comfortable, clean rooms.

Staff speaks good enough English.Overall Hotel Atmosphere: WonderfulRoom and Bathrooms: No complaints at allHotel Location: Not in the centre of the touristy part of town but we did not mind. It is 2 subway stations to Ginza and other shopping districts.This was our first trip to Japan. We were mesmerized by their culture and courtesy. What a marvelous inspiration they had on me.We had heard how unaffordable Tokyo is and were very pleasantly surprised by how affordable the hotel was and the wonderful size of our room. No complaints at all.We have traveled quite a bit in Europe and are used to much smaller rooms at much higher prices. We made resevervations at Hotels.com about one week prior to our trip.Best way to arrive from Narita Airport is by the Airport Limosuine (spelling?:) Bus. Costs US $ 25/person. And they drop you right at the entrance and very pleasantly help with all your luggage. And they frown upon tipping. What a marvelous and hard-working culture.Not much of sight seeing around the hotel. It is in more of a business district. The Imperial Palace Gardens are about 15-20 minutes walk from the hotel. Do not feel too bad if you do not get to see them. But if time permits it is a nice walk and visit.There is a 7-11 and a few convenient stores near the hotel, close to the subway station entrance.We would highly recomemnd this hotel for its price, service and overall atmosphere.The hotel can assist you with various tourist tours - Mt Fuji, etc.Please feel free to contact me should you have any questions.", "Date": "Feb 12, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR129461956", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "3"}, "Author": "RoxySteele"}, {"Content": "Hotel in a beautiful time warp.", "Date": "Jul 20, 2006", "ReviewID": "UR591833085", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "3", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "cleeksock"}, {"Content": "Fair hotel, but nothing great. Stayed at the Grand Palace for three nights on a recent trip to Tokyo. The room was small and smelled a bit funny. But the biggest problem was that they had no air conditioning in the room, since, as they kindly explained, the entire building could only be in 'heat mode' or 'cool mode'. It was in heat mode, and even with the heat turned off the room was stuffy and hot. The bathroom was exceedingly tiny and the shower head was way too low for anybody over about 5 feet.  The staff was curtious and helpful though, and the restaurants were ok, if overpriced. They do offer free internet access, which is a definite plus since most other places charge ~$15/day.  I may have been a bit harsh on the hotel, as I had just come from staying at the Four Seasons Marunouchi which was incomparably nice, but also four times the price. If you're looking for a nothing special hotel for not a bad price, the Grand Palace will certainly work.", "Date": "Mar 23, 2006", "ReviewID": "UR921383517", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "3", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "jdubois"}, {"Content": "A very grand palace...hotel Spacious rooms, great location, very clean hotel. The Grand Palace has very helpful concierge however, when you need help, make sure they know that you're a guest of the hotel. We were trying to ask for instructions on how to ride the shinkansen and we weren't treated very well until we mentioned that we were staying at the hotel. It's about a block away from the nearest train station and about 2-3 blocks away from the nearest JR station. Breakfast buffet was included and it was exceptional. It was a combination of Western and Japanese food - great selection. To have a cheaper meal, we bought packed sushi and rice toppings from the convenience store just across the street - great Japanese food at very affordable prices.The hotel was just a few blocks away from the Tokyo Imperial Palace. Actually, it's a little out of the way but with the trains, it's really easy to get around once you get the hang of it. Just follow the colors (orange for Ginza, etc.) and know where you're going and you'll get back to the hotel safely.People in Japan are very courteous and kind but during rush hour, they're beasts!

This hotel's manager knows my wife's aunt, so perhaps we get some amount of special treatment, but even so, I believe, as with most things Japanese, the average American would be pleased with a visit. The hotel (when we last visited in 2001) was not most modern and up-to-date, but was comfortable. Our only problem is that whenever we've stayed we are given two beds and not one, but I also have to wonder whether that's because they know we're westerners. I always get the deal that includes the hotel's breakfast along with the room -- at the buffet (viking) you can eat healthy (yogurt, fruit, cereals) or have eggs, bacon, green beans (!), french fries, and the like. Or you can have an authentic Japanese breakfast (fish, rice, etc.) at the Japanese restaurant. The hotel staff all speak understandable English (as does practically everyone in Tokyo) and is exceedingly happy to help. There's an express bus (for a fee) directly from and to Narita. The hotel is a block from one subway station and three blocks from another, near the Imperial Palace and gardens and a nice walk (or run) along the Tokyo River. You're also not far from the Tokyo Dome, in case the Yomiuri Giants are in town. And, if you hunger for things western, there's a McDonald's around the corner, two Starbucks nearby, etc., etc. And, oh yes, you get the fancy electronic toilet seats. If you stay across the Imperial Gardens the hotels will be fancier and more expensive, but if you're sightseeing, you don't need to worry about what's in your hotel room, anyway.By the way, we've always managed to log into America Online from the hotel, so we can even check our email.", "Date": "Aug 24, 2004", "ReviewID": "UR580394076", "Ratings": {"Service": "-1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "-1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "4", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "-1", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member"}, {"Content": "\u9288\u5e7f\u506a\u9289\u51a6\u5120\u9287\ue1bc\ue1f3\u8e47\u6ebf\u4eb4\u7ef1\u72b3\u6ade\u9288\u5908\u4ed0\u9287\u5b28\u4eef\u9287\u71b4\u20ac?#x201d;   showReview(23388373, 'full');", "Date": "Jan 8, 2009", "ReviewID": "UR946231015", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "\u9287\u52e9\u4eed\u9287\u64b1\u4ed2"}, {"Content": "\u9287\u66d8\u4eda\u9287\u5c8b\u7d12\u9287\ue042\u4f04\u9287\ue0a2\u7568\u9287?#x201d;   showReview(21375350, 'full');", "Date": "Oct 29, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR711450662", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "2", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "3"}, "Author": "shu1"}, {"Content": "\u7035\u60e7\u7e59\u9287\ue218\u4ecc\u9287\u6b0d\u4eb4\u6d93\u20ac\u5a34?#x201d;   showReview(19189166, 'full');", "Date": "Aug 21, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR583808657", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "3", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "\u9287\u00b0\u5017\u9287\u70bd\u4eef\u9287\u5fcb\u4eda"}, {"Content": "peites remarques   showReview(11664566, 'full');", "Date": "Oct 8, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR329558404", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "5", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "lass="}, {"Content": "sastifaits   showReview(11398349, 'full');", "Date": "Mar 12, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR935478800", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "4", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "lass="}], "HotelInfo": {"HotelURL": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1066443-d307340-r20379669-Grand_Palace_Hotel-Chiyoda_Tokyo_Tokyo_Prefecture_Kanto.html", "HotelID": "307340", "Price": "$402"}}
