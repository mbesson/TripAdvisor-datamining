The hosts Stephan and son Benjamin are very friendly and informative and even when extremely busy, they are attentive and helpful. They have bicycles in their old and very cool cellar that you can rent for 10 euros a day. The rooms are basic with very high ceilings.

I didn't like the tiny shower cubicle and the fact that there was not enough lights in the room. the pillows were too thin. But on the upside, everything was spotless and towels are changed everyday.

Our rooms were not very spacious but he manager said if we come again we will get better rooms next time! It was fully booked when we stayed so it can't be helped. Breakfast was a very comprehensive buffet which was very good value as it was included in the room rate and we already had 3 nights for the price of 2. The rooms have a mini bar with reasonably priced drinks if you fancy a nightcap. Would recommend this hotel and if you want a bit of space and comfy chairs in your room ask for one of the bigger ones, but for a couple of days the smaller ones are fine. The staff witll order you a taxi if you want one, which comes in less than 5 mins or they will get out a map and help you find the right train to take!", "Date": "December 10, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "tremolat", "Title": "\u201cjust the best\u201d", "Author": "poppytwo", "ReviewID": "UR6333153", "Content": "What can we say to tell you what a great deal you get at this hotel that has not already been said.

I organised the accommodation through the Berlin tourist office and checked the reviews on here. All of my friends thought this was a great hotel so there another 14 people backing this review! The hotel was based just down from the underground and was easy to find once you knew what side of the road you were on! The welcome was really nice and they were ready for us all arriving at once. We got to pick our rooms from a list so certain smaller groups could be together. The rooms were a good size with a decent sized bathroom. We had a shower and the shower tray was rather deep so if you have short legs like me be careful! The rooms were warm and cosy as were the beds so no complaints there. The hotel was based beside some good resturants and the pub a couple of doors down on the corner became our local and our meeting point. The highlight of this hotel must be the breakfasts. The buffet was like nothing I had ever seen before. Acres of food, everything you could imagine - fruit, meat, cheese, sweets, bread, rolls, cornflakes, fish, fruit salads piled up on different levels. It looked like a church harvest display. If you stocked up at breakfast you didn't need to eat until the evening. The staff were really nice and coped admirably with so many of us bumbling about and asking questions all the time. I would recommend this hotel to anyone (except those looking for 4 star luxury) and I would definitely go back!", "Date": "August 22, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Osnabruck, Germany", "Title": "\u201cGreat time\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR5010992", "Content": "Stayed at the Tiergarten with my husband and two children and were well looked after.

I can recommend this hotel very strongly to anyone who wants to stay in an atmospheric and charming small hotel with excellent service. The hotel building is converted from a set of nineteenth century apartments in a commercial and residential area of central Berlin - a very good place to experience the atmosphere of everyday Berlin, away from the tourists. It is not a highly luxurious hotel, but very carefully run and convenient, with attention to every detail. Breakfast is generous and excellent. We wanted to hold a small meeting at the hotel, and the manager and staff could not have been more helpful and obliging. While several other Berlin hotels I contacted wanted to charge us at high rates for just using a meeting routine for 6 people (we needed no other facilities), the Tiergarten staff were very happy to make their breakfast room available for our meeting for most of the day free of charge, and were very flexible about supplying us with coffee at minimal charge whenever we wanted it.

Large triples and quads make ideal for families. My single was a fair size with excellent lighting (a reading lamp at last!) and new bathroom. Incredible breakfast buffet with widest choice I've ever seen in 3 (or 4)star hotel. Staff are pleasant and helpful,with tips on transport, sights (and info on emergency room at hospital!) S-Bahn station Bellevue was nearby (pleasant walk by river then over the bridge) and we used it more than U-Bahn Turmstrasse which is right by the hotel. With S-Bahn you get to see the city and we found Friedrchstrasse a much less confusing station to connect at than Zoo. Both these stations 2 stops away. Short journeys (up to 3 stops) cost less: Kurzstreckenkarte. If you're doing more travelling the day ticket at 5.60 is better value (Kids up to 14 pay less). Even better value for group, Kleingruppenkarte at 14 euros covers 5 people for a day. Reception sells tickets and has maps of U & S-Bahn network, which you'll find essential!", "Date": "April 19, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "4", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Wrexham.
