We stayed for 3 nights midweek and the hotel did seem rather quiet. We had a 10th outwardly/street facing room which was great because I am happy to watch the world go by from the nearly floor to ceiling windows. Even the bathroom has two floor to ceiling windows so you could like in the bath and watch the skyline. The only challenge was that because it was the top floor there was a lip on the roof which obscured the skyline unless you were standing on the window base/sill. Our room was on the curve of the building and we though it rather small. You could not adequately walk around the bed without climbing over the chair. The chair itself did not have a foot stool like other rooms because frankly it wouldn't fit I expect. The Nespresso Coffee is a nice addition but the lack of alternatives such as hot chocolate and tea was dissapointing. The Staff were great, helpful and friendly as you might expect from a five star hotel. We had a room only rate and did not have breakfast in the hotel because frankly at \u20ac21 for an American Breakfast is too expensive and so is a \u20ac14 continental. I gave the hotel a 4 out of 5 because of 3 things only. The size of the room, charging \u20ac12.50 per 24hours of internet and the pillows* *They give you 4 pillows on the bed but I would think that you would need 8 pillows to have it, in any way, emulate an actual normal pillow. You do get a pillow menu but they are for anti allergy and neck support pillows. They didn't offer \"standard\" pillows. I had to use the chair cushion and on the last night the dressing gown to support my head. I have attached pictures of our room and view. Location is great dependant on your needs. There are a number of places around the lunch and evening meals, the transport links like all of Berlin are superb(U-Bahn,S-Bahn and R-Bahn). Shopping is right on your doorstep.

Athough at first the room was on a lower floor, at my request they moved me into a higher one- where the view is indeed better.

The room is very comfortable, with big desk and a very comfy lounge bed to do your reading. The gym is indeed on the small sidebut with ample cardio rooms. Maybe the only little downsize is the breakfast- at 21 Euro i would have appreciated a little more attantion to detail (melon cuttings included raw bits, the swiss bircher musli was quite poor and the quality of pastries was also mediocre)- these are minor things, but this is a hotel aiming to be in the top bracket.....

We stayed in the standard room which was more than big enough for 2 people. The double bed was in fact 2 beds together but that only made it really big and we found it/them comfortable. The storage space in some hotel rooms is poor but not so at the Swissotel. There were plenty of drawers, a sizeable wardrobe and space to hang coats etc, as well as adequate storage space for the suitcases. The cleaning of the room was spot-on and the housekeeping worked extremely hard in the rooms and around the public areas. The staff on reception, the doormen and especially the bar staff were a real credit to the company - they couldn't do enough for you. A special thank you to the 2 males on duty in the bar who gave us information about getting to the Olympic Stadium and Potsdam. They went off to get us accurate details on travelling by S Bahn and as a result we had a great visit. They seemed to work long hours in the bar area but didn't rush anyone. The company obviously have taken on the criticisms in some reviews as the Wifi in the reception was free to us and we didn't have to pay to print off our boarding passes. My husband used the fitness centre several times and felt that the equipment there was of a very good standard. We both used the sauna and there are plenty of towels, dressing gowns and slippers to use afterwards. We went out each day and either walked or used our Berlin Welcome Cards to visit lots of the sites, and coming back to this hotel at the end of a tiring day still made us feel that the enjoyable experience didn't end when we were in our room. Like others we didn't eat in the hotel as we wanted to visit different restaurants and felt that if the breakfast was 21 Euros then the meals in Restaurant 44 would probably be very expensive as well. We managed to get a deal - stay 3 nights get the 4th free so overall we felt it was well worth it. The location is very near the transport terminus so it is easy to get out and about, however most historical sites aren't that close. There is excellent shopping in the locality which I particularly enjoyed, not so sure my husband did! We would go again to a Swissotel if they are all as good as this one.

The location of the hotel is great. Bang on the shopping district of Berlin, the Kurfurstendamm, the hotel is only a 5 minutes walk from the station of the same name & a 7 minute walk from the Zooligscher Garden station. There are city tour buses, that start from 100m from the hotel. You can choose between a whole city tour bus or whether you want to see only the east/west side of Berlin. The hotel is also very close from one of the good museums in Berlin - The Story of Berlin. There are immense shopping options on the street next to the hotel, with flagship stores of Germany specific brands like Jack Wolfskin. Our check in was around afternoon. The welcoming staff on the front desk was brilliant. One noticeable thing was the separation of responsibilities. The front desk and the concierge was separate. The concierge handles all the touristy information requests and the front desk pays all attention to the fact that their guest is checked in with all warmth and brilliance. We dealt with Benjamin on the front desk and right from the way he spoke to the way he showed us to our room was simply wonderful. The interior of the hotel is strikingly beautiful. The lobby has warm color schemes and has a soothing effect on your eyes. The room was perfect for a couple. Good lighting, great view of the Kurfurstendamm, the elite shopping street of Berlin. There was a expresso coffee machine and the presentation of the variety of coffee in a leather box was superb. Unlike many hotels in Germany, this one had english channels on the menu and that was an added advantage. The cleanliness of the rooms was super and so was the bathroom. The room service was exceptional. We had a little issue with the coffee maker and we had a person on our door within 5 minutes of our call. The hotel also has a luggage room for those who dont want to pay for an extra night but are touring the hotel during the day. We didnt even have to carry and drop our luggage to the luggage room. The guy serving us on the check out asked us to leave it right where we were standing and the rest was taken care of. The staff is also very prompt in rolling out a Berlin city map in front of you as soon as you have a question and they would make sure that they marked the ways and locations on the map for you to carry around. There are many restaurants around the Swissotel. One that deserves a mention is an Italian joint called the Vapiano, right across the street. The food is great, is served freshly cooked in front of you and is the most comfortable, if you want to just walk out of the hotel to grab a bite. The only downside is, its a self service restaurant. (Also, that it is very full all the time, so dont be very assured of a seat immediately). The only thing that stopped us from rating it excellent instead of Very Good is the cellphone reception at the hotel. We could not make any calls while we were at the hotel, neither did the internet on our phones work, even when there were full signal bars. There was free wifi at the reception which was a good thing but we had to make calls from the hotel phone and it was quite expensive. All in all, the Swissotel was a treat. It was one of the best hotels that we have stayed at.

Hotel inside is lovely and room was perfect size for a couple - added bonus was a couple of English channels on the TV for when we came in at night and the expresso machine for the morning! In terms of location the hotel was about a twenty minute train ride away from the airport (going to the zoo bahn) and five minute walk from the station to the hotel. Subway station was just round the corner so was easy to travel about, and if you fancy a cheap bus tour (without the guide) jump on the 100 bus outside the zoo bahn station and they will take you round all the sites on the price of a bus ticket. Don't make the same mistake as us and think the 200 will take you on the same route - it doesn't and takes a lot longer (we almost missed out flight jumping on it!). The only point i would make about location is that we said next time it would be nice to stay on the east side - the location was good for shopping but the historical sites were all on the east! Make sure you try the Italian restaurant across the road!! Brilliant - take a card when you arrive from the front desk then go to the pizza or pasta counter of your choice, pick what you want and see it made in front of you. You can then go back as many times as you like just putting the food on your card! Brilliant idea and the food was gorgeous and obviously fresh!!! Also on the subject of food we had room service for breakfast every day and it was cheaper than the 20 odd euros it is to go downstairs to the main breakfast room. Obviously you don't get the choice but if you don't eat much or are lazy like us its an option to be considered! Overall this hotel is fantastic and Berlin is a fantastic city to visit.

The Hotel is on the Kurf\u00fcrstendamm, but the entrance is just around the corner. As well as being close the the Zoo Garden which is a main travel hub with buses and the S-Bahn & U-Bahn lines the hotel is right near the Kurf\u00fcrstendamm U-Bahn station.

All the staff were excellent, really helpful and spoke good English. On check in were were given a tourist map and pointed to the main sights. There were a few nice touches like the Nespresso machine in the room, the pillow menu, ability to get a soft mattress topper (as the beds are on the hard side) and one of our favourites - on New Years morning there was a member of staff dressed as a nurse giving out hangover cures just outside the breakfast restaurant! We were able to get a late check out for no extra charge. We ate breakfast in the restaurant each morning, this was a buffet but you could also order certain fresh items. Buffet was a good variety from continental cold meat/cheese, croissants/bread, cereals/fruit through to scrambled eggs/bacon etc. Again staff in the restaurant were excellent.

We accepted the room change and were moved to one of the top floors. The view was amazing and the although rooms are of a moderate size, they had utilised the space very well with clever storage spaces. The bathroom was beautiful with a bath right next to the window so you can look at the fantastic views of the Kurfurstendam. The food within the restaurant was very nice although we only had breakfast as there are many wonderful places to eat in Berlin. As you leave the hotel, you are straight onto the Kurfurstendam. We had walked straight into Berlins Gay Parade and it was fantastic. The whole street was crammed with floats, music, beer stalls, entertainment and colour. We spent the whole day watching the entertainment and sampling the food and beer from the stalls. You are very well situated from this hotel. The subway is directly accross the road and the you are on the main shopping street with the Charlottenburg Palaces just up the road. The tour buses also stop about 10 metres from the front entrance.

Upon our arrival and check-in the guy on the desk offered us the possibility of keeping our room until 4pm on our departure date as we had a late evening flight, we gladly accepted and expected there to be some charge for this but when it came to checking out we were pleasantly surprised to find that they hadn't charged us any extra for this. That attention to detail set the benchmark for the whole break and I'm pleased to say that Swissotel staff didn't falter on this once. We sought the knowledge of Swissotel staff frequently whether it be for directions or a recommendation for a specific type of restaurant and they never let us down.

We had booked the hotel based on the excellent reviews on Trip Advisor but they simply do not do the hotel justice. The hotel staff are exceptional and although we had minimum interaction without staff on the whole, each member of staff was friendly and welcoming. What we liked: The hotel is in an excellent location and was easy to find. It is on one of the main streets in West Berlin for shopping and evening entertainment. We were very lucky that upon arrival, we were upgraded to a room with a stunning view of Kurfurstendamm which was in the middle of it's light festival, but similar views can be admired from the hotel's restaurant. The hotel is located just a few minutes walk from a major S and U barn station (Zoological Garten) which made it incredibly cheap and easy to travel to and from the airport and popular sights around the city. Unlimited travel of trains and buses were 6 euro but we got unlimited travel and discounted entries to sights using a \"Welcome to Berlin\" pass which was purchased at the airport on arrival for 72 hours for 25 euros instead. The rooms are well sized, with excellent amenities including espresso maker, quality hairdryer etc. I was impressed with small touches including a personalised welcome note and the provision of those little things that we may forget from charging adapters and cotton wool pads to miniature chocolates. The pillow menu was an excellent addition and I only wish I could have taken the pillow home with me! We only ordered from room service in terms of food and this was OK. It came swiftly and again was accompanied by excellent service. The overall standard was excellent and the rooms were clean, airy and easy to get up to your optimum temperature. Areas for improvement: My only gripe with this hotel, as with other reviewers, was the internet access. I am used to getting free Wi-Fi connection at hotels that I use but had to pay 12.50 per 24 hours for internet access. I would not mind as much if it was reliable but it cut out regularly and became rather frustrating, so I did not bother to purchase further usage after the first 24 hour period lapsed. If reliable, inclusive internet access had been provided then I think this hotel would be perfect!

Our standard room was spacious, and had a bath and a shower, which is always a good thing, and the \"Swiss\" products (made in Canada using essential Swiss ingredients!!) in the bathroom were lovely too. Coffee-lovers are well catered for - brilliant in-room coffee maker (although the instructions were not easy to work out), although this was a slight disappointment as my other half really only likes tea in the mornings, and none was provided. My main negative about the room was the bed. I love a firm bed, but this was something else - unprecedentedly firm! it was unlike any other bed I have slept on. If you don't normally like a firm bed, then avoid the Swissotel - you will not be able to cope with it. Also strange was the fact that the duvet only just reached the edges of the bed, meaning that when 2 adults were under it, it was really too small. After our first night, I told reception who were very apologetic and immediately brought up an additional duvet cover (which was certainly a solution, albeit an odd one - a duvet the right size would have been fine!). There is a gym and relaxation area with a sauna (but no steam-room or swimming pool) - and the latter is a very German affair - mixed, naked and with no changing room! The location of the Swissotel is slap-bang in the middle of the (high-street type) shops on the Ku'damm, so if shopping is a key thing for you when visiting Berlin, then the location is excellent. If however you are on your first hoilday to Berlin and want to potter round the historic old centre of Berlin, seeing the main sites, museums etc. then I would recommend instead of staying here, getting a hotel in the Mitte part of the city - eg the Hilton on Gendarmenmakt - where we have also spent a splendid weekend previously.", "Date": "October 23, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Norrkoping, Sweden", "Title": "\u201cReally good\u201d", "Author": "Martin L", "ReviewID": "UR119322698", "Content": "+ good price + very nice sauna and restroom + executive lounge, fantastic service + nice personal + 50m to main shopping street + breakfast", "Date": "October 15, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Warsaw, Poland", "Title": "\u201cexcellent\u201d", "Author": "Mondi61", "ReviewID": "UR119003511", "Content": "Excellent hotel in Berlin!

This including an excellent pasta buffet on the night before, and early breakfast, flexible sauna hours and even directions for short prep runs in Tiergarten. The hotel itself is modern, quiet and very comfortable. There was some road noise on the Sat night but you'd expect that in any city. Earplugs were employed! One quibble: no free wifi for the laptop. An unbelievable thing in modern hotel!

Location: in the heart of West Berlin. This is either a positive or negative depending on what you are looking for. It is not going to be the hip part of Berlin, but it is clean, nice, and relaxed. Multiple public transit options are nearby, so it is easy to get wherever in Berlin (though it is a big city and you are definitely a little way from good areas in the former East Berlin). In all, this is a fine location for anybody, but especially good if you are traveling with kids or not as interested in the more energetic, but grittier parts of Berlin. As long as TXL is open this location is good for getting to or from TXL both by public transit and also by taxi (it is pretty cheap taxi ride as TXL is on the western side of the city) 2. Staff: didn't have to interact with them much, but they seemed very friendly. 3. Rooms/lobby: very nice and modern inside the hotel. Lobby is very sleek, and though slightly strange that you have to take an elevator up a level to get to the lobby, this does make it feel much calmer in the lobby, which is probably what they were going for. The rooms aren't huge, but are a decent size for a European hotel room, and more importantly are nice. The bed was comfortable, and though the pillows were bad, they have a whole pillow menu allowing you to get what you'd like. Nespresso machines in the room is a nice touch. Also, the shower was a nice, large size, great when compared to many small showers in other European cities. 4. Breakfast: excellent. The best breakfast buffet I've had in Europe. Excellent selection, plus attentive waitstaff to get you what you want that isn't on the buffet (e.g., coffee drinks) 5. Internet: this is the hotel's biggest negative. I understand that the Swissotel isn't the only fancy hotel that charges for wifi (Ritz Carlton charges for Internet, for example), but that doesn't make it ok. When you stay at a nice hotel you expect all the little things to be thought out and taken care of, and having to be a large fee just to use wifi comes across as cheap and unthoughtful. I'm sure it is a huge profit maker, but, again, this does not make it right. They wouldn't charge for using TV, so they shouldn't charge for wifi. I'd rather they charge a few Euros more a night and provide wifi for free than have to do little add ons to get the full product. To their credit there are two desktop computers available to use for free in the lobby, but really, in 2011 shouldn't people just be able to quickly and freely access the internet on their laptops/iphones/ipads in their rooms? On a similar note, the amount charged by the hotel for local phone calls was also unnecessarily high. Overall, I liked this hotel a lot, and would gladly stay here again if I were staying in that part of Berlin. For a good price, which I got since I was there in winter, it is a great place to stay. But I can't give 5 stars to a place charging so much just to use wifi. I notice several people complaining about this in 5 star reviews. Really unless people actually make the hotel realize that it isn't ok to charge for something that many cheaper, less fancy hotels are able to provide for free, they won't ever consider changing their policy.", "Date": "September 23, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Baku, Azerbaijan", "Title": "\u201cPerfect hotel in perfect location\u201d", "Author": "Riad104", "ReviewID": "UR118437761", "Content": "This was my 5th trip to Berlin but first experience with Swissotel which I always noticed as greatly located right on K'Damm.

Online booking was easy; the rooms were ready when we arrived at 11:30, and the late check-out at 15:00 was no problem. Great. Room prices are very reasonable, certainly when the quality of the room is taken into account. You'll easily pay two or three times as much in any other European Capital for something similar. The location is perfect, right at the Kurfurstendamm, with the bus to the airport stopping almost in front of the hotel. Which, by the way, is a great tip when you first arrive; the hotel has its entrance at the back. You could be right in front of the hotel without knowing it because the ground floor is taken by C&A. Just around the right corner you'll find the entrance to the hotel; elevators take you right up to the lobby. Zoologischer Garten is just a 5 minute walk away, from there you can take almost any kind of public transport into the very enjoyable city of Berlin. The bus is a great way of exploring it, you can buy a 'Tagesgruppekarte' at the driver which will let you and 4 others use any bus for the whole day; don't miss that one.

The hotel staff were all excellent very helpful and we were able to get into our room, which was a good size and comfortable, when we arrived at 1pm. The main shopping area is just outside the hotel on the Ku'damm. and there are pleny of places to eat. The food hall on the top floor of the main store KA DE WE (not on Ku'damm but still near the hotel) is a must see if you like food. There is an unusual Italian restaurant straight across the road from the hotel where you queue up to order your food and drink and it if made in front of you as you wait. You then just take it to a table. The bill is added to a card which you pay as you leave so you can get more food, a sweet or more drinks if you like. We only went there because it was raining very heavily on the Friday evening but were glad we did as the food was good and the atmosphere relaxing. The main area for the museums, the Reichstag and the Brandenberg gate are a short 10- 12 minute train journey from the hotel. You could opt to walk through the Teirgarten park area although this is about 2.5 - 3 kilometres from the hotel to The Brandenberg Gate and probably another kilometer to the Pergamon Museum. It is a nice walk though and a good way to see the city. There are plenty of tour buses that you can hop on and off and the very helpful concierge will pont you in the right direction.

I got very delayed getting to Gatwick on a Friday night after a stressfull trip to the airport having to change flight but when I got to this hotel, I forgot it all. The glass lift to the first floor reception is funny, a bit Harry Potterish, and the welcome is one of the warmest I ever had. The staff whom I rang from the UK about my late arrival due to change of flight couldn't do any more to make me feel at ease and make it easy for me. Armed with my electronic key, you can let the elevator read it and take you to your exact floor of your booked room. The room is fantastically spacious, smart, modern and very comfortable with all the amenities you would need and even an expresso machine!! The bathroom has a big bath as well as a walking shower, take your pick. The side suede relaxing chair is great to put your aching feet up but the bed is one of the best bed I ever slept in apart from my expensive one at home. The TV has all the channels with all the languages you may speak and my atrium room was ever so quiet that I wished I could have stayed longer. The icing on the cake was having brunch at 11.30am in the breakfast restaurant where they serve it until midday...truly indulgent. The choice was mind-blowing and I had a real feast. Yes some may say it is a bit on the dear side pricewise but for a weekend break and as a treat, I'll say it is more than worth it because you can litterally eat like a Queen and the food is fresh, very well presented and mouthwatering, definitevely delicious, and you will have a real job to get up once you'll satisfied your appetite..:-) not for those on a diet... The hotel location is another great asset, very easy to catch the train back to the Schoenefeld airport where Easyjet flies to. Also within a few minutes walk from the underground and the bus routes. I will need to go back because their hotel spa was being refurbished that week and the one they offered in the meantime was a very sophisticated fitness/wellness centre around the corner and at the top of 300 steps (there is a lift available but I needed to work the calories of my brunch off) but not as convenient at the end of a long day visiting the sites. There isn't any better hotel I would recommend and I have stayed in quite a few. I can't wait to try most of the other Swissotel establishments spread around the world and check that their most excellent service is as great there than in Berlin.

Try it for yourself if you think you deserve it and you should have the same if not a similar experience..I almost forgot, for those who prefer leaving the laptop at home, there is a free state of the art PC with fast broadband at the guest's disposal behind the porter's lodge and it is on a first come first served basis to check your emails or check the web for location of good local restaurants/events or else..", "Date": "July 29, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Helsinki, Finland", "Title": "\u201cThe best welcome we ever had in any hotel\u201d", "Author": "sweeties_forever", "ReviewID": "UR115789503", "Content": "This is a very excellent hotel!

I wouldn\u2019t stay at the Swissotel if you\u2019re after \u2018hip\u2019 Berlin, as it\u2019s in pretty much in the opposite side of the city for that. There is a bit of a business atmosphere about the place, too, though when I was there, there was a good mixture of business people and tourists. Swissotel sits pretty much on a busy shopping street (think Regent Street, London), but there are excellent transport links to all of Berlin within walking distance. If this were all the area had to offer, then I wouldn\u2019t have been pleased, but if you investigate the local area behind the department stores and Cartier shops, you\u2019ll be pleasantly surprised by its relaxed caf\u00e9s and restaurants, which were, I was pleased to see, full of real Berliners. I chose not to eat at the hotel, as I thought the prices were a little on the high side, but the food could have been amazing, I just don\u2019t know. I\u2019m very fussy about quality of my food, and the following places relatively near the hotel didn\u2019t disappoint: Caf\u00e9 im Literaturhaus Wintergarten (Fasanenstrasse 23), Fagiano, (Fasanenstrasse 41), Ruhland & Ruhland (Knesebeckstrasse 5), Caf\u00e9 Savigny (Grolmanstrasse 54/54) and the excellent pasta canteen opposite the hotel called Vapiano (Augsburger Strasse 43). The staff at the hotel were very professional and friendly. I want to make special reference to Timo, the concierge. I rented a bike for my whole trip from an excellent local company called RadKom http://www.radkom.de/fahrradvermietung-berlin.html, but I got a little confused about various terms and conditions. Timo called RadKom for me and explained to me about insurance, what happens if the bike gets stolen, etc. It was little touches that this that made my experience at Swissotel very positive indeed. The standard of room, bed, and housekeeping was excellent, though a business vibe was present in the room, which was impressively spacious. The A/C was also a huge welcome in during a very hot week in Berlin.

Arrival/Check in: On arrival, the taxi door was opened by the bell staff and help with luggage offered (and refused -I'd carried my small bag all the way from the UK, I think I can manage for the last few steps). You walk into the foyer of the hotel and take the elevator up to the first floor for check in. The lobby of the hotel is extremely modern, with plenty of glass and white marble. There is also a small cafe (24/7) which serves a lighter breakfast option (i.e. croissants, a 'takeaway' breakfast, doughnuts and snacks round the clock). The front desk is located to the right immediately upon entering. By the time I had reached the smiling receptionist, I had already formed a great impression of the Swissotel: first impressions count. The lady checked us in to our room, and then escorted us up to our room, pausing to point out Restaurant 44, the bar and the aforementioned cafe. There is a different bank of elevators to take you to the guest room levels, and one has to walk past reception to get to it. This made me feel very secure, as did the fact that the lifts are keycard operated, meaning that the bedrooom levels of the hotel are only accessible to registered guests. The lady took us to our room, and then showed us how things like the a/c, TV and coffee machine worked. I also asked her about getting to the Tiergaten (a park), and she produced a map, circled the hotel and the park, and suggested the best way to get there (i.e. get on at the Zoo stop not the nearest U bahn station to avoid having to change trains) and how the ticket system works, as well as that we have to 'validate' our ticket before we get on the train (you get fined if you don't). She left us with a smile and the comment that the concierge or the front desk were there to help with anything we may need. Great arrival! Rooms We had booked the cheapest room at the hotel, and it was still fairly large. The bathroom has a separate bath and walk-in rainforest shower, as well as a telephone and a vanity mirror that doesn't steam up when the shower has been on (it is designed not to), which is useful for shaving etc. The bedroom has a large flatscreen TV, two direct dial telephones, a nespresso coffee machine (with six capsules, which are replaced daily), a minibar, a safe with an electrical outlet in it, meaning you can put your laptop/mobile phone on charge in the safe etc.) The room also has some interesting and stylish lamps. The bedside lamps were very good because they are totally adjustable up/down/left/right, so you can get a 'spot' of light on your book, without desturbing the person asleep next to you. Another little touch that made this hotel extra special was the fact that the desk had a proper, adjustable, work chair. There was also an armchair with footstall. There is also a minibar which, unlike so many hotels, doesn't automatically register items out -so for example, if you accidentally lift up a coke instead of a diet coke, you don't get charged (provided, of course, that you don't drink it.) Housekeeping check and re stock the minibar each day. There is a bit of extra space in there for you to put your own purchases in (we put a bottle of wine in there which we had been given as a present by a friend.) The room also has a 'pillow menu'. Now these are quite common in hotels these days, and I've never actually felt the need to change my pillows etc before, but the pillows on the bed were so soft you just sank through them. They offered 0 support. The mattress was also REALLY hard. So, like a complete ponce, I phoned housekeeping and got my pillows changed to memory foam ones, and also got a 'mattress softner' put on the bed. This was done with the minimum of fuss and made me feel slightly less like some really posh snob trying to be difficult. The adjustments made, I slept like a baby every night. Really very comfortable sleep. Food & Beverage offering On arrival, we were given a voucher for a free special cocktail in the bar, and the bar itself was fantastic -it is open every night until 2AM and has very good service. Breakfast was in Restaurant 44 -good selection of food from the buffet, along with a la carte items such as omelettes and waffles. The service was attentive throughout. We didn't use the hotel restaurant for any other meals, but did use room service quite a bit. The service takes the usual 30-40 minutes to arrive, but it is always presented very well on a table that they wheel into your room. The table is already set with place settings etc, and a fresh flower (they bring this even if you just order a pot of tea which they bring on a tray -again, a fresh flower is a small touch and shows attention to detail.) On the second day, we upgraded ourselves to the 'executive lounge'. The benefit of doing this (price was 30EUR each per day) was really that we could get breakfast in there, instead of paying 21EUR each for it downstairs, and you can get unlimited free drinks in the evening between 1730 and 2200, as well as hot food presentations and pralines. The lounge was quiet throughout our stay, and the service was always really superb -the person remembered us and our drink preferences (for instance, throughout Europe, if you order tea, they don't automatically bring milk, but this lady remembered that we take milk with tea, and brought milk each time -another little touch that differentiates this hotel from others.) Concierge This is the one negative I have for this hotel, and it really is what nearly stopped me from giving this hotel a 5 out of 5 rating. The concierge was rarely there. There is NO concierge service AT ALL on a Sunday, and during the week, he seems to take the afternoons off. Whilst this may seem like a small point, the Swissotel is a large five-star property, and I sort of expect to be able to go to the concierge desk after lunch at say 2pm and get information. Most hotels of this size have a team of concierges -this hotel only has the one. I guess this is also a plus, because, like the lounge, the concierge remembered me and queried how I had found the restaurant he had booked for me. Those who want to see Berlin needn't worry, I found that the front desk were very knowledgable about what to do, how to get to places, and dinner reservations etc when the concierge wasn't there. They didn't have the 'it's not my job' attitude that so many employees have these days, but they actually seemed to really want to exceed your expectations and to make you have the best time possible in Berlin. Technology The hotel does have wifi and wired internet...at a charge. I found the charge to be about average for a 5*, and did use it. There is also the 'business corner', which literally, and this is not one word of exaggeration, is two computers behind the concierge desk. If you didn't know it was there, you would think it was the concierge's office...The computers are free to use and you can also print for free, which is another nice little touch. Location The location of the hotel is good for the Ku'dam -a principal shopping street. You can easily walk (and it's a nice walk too) to KaDaWe, which is to Berlin what Harrods is to London, and to other shops too. Berlin has loads of Starbucks, which is unusual for a European city outside of the UK, and the nearest Starbucks is just 'round the corner from the hotel. Tube (S-bahn) stations are numerous -the closest, Ku'damm, is right outside the hotel: just go out of the main entrance/exit, turn right, and first right, and you're there. It is a bit further to get to, say, the Tiergaten/Reichstag/Brandenburg Gate, but I'd say you can walk it in 30 minutes, or get the S-Bahn, or get a taxi, which should cost you no more than 10 Euros. Verdict/Conclusion The Swissotel is my type of hotel. Luxurious? Yes. No it doesn't have massive opulent chandaliers like the Ritz, and the staff don't bow down to you. However, the hotel does exactly what it says on the tin (providing a 'Swiss' approach to hospitality). To define the service, I think it's best to say friendly but not 'in your face' -i.e. if you just want a cup of coffee and to read the 'paper in peace, you will be left alone. On the other hand, if you want a bit of advice on the menu, or what to see/do, any member of staff will cheerfully and enthusiastically tell you. The service is 'can do': that means that they don't like to say 'no'. Despite the hotel being completely sold out on our day of departure, the front desk gracefully granted a 3pm late checkout at no additional charge. It's little things like the things above, and like the late check out, and like being shown to my room, that I appreciate and that make me want to come back to the Swissotel over other 5* properties in Berlin. Berlin has loads of 5* properties -the InterContinental, the Ritz-Carlton, the Grand Hyatt, the Adlon, the JW Marriott, Hilton, Radisson Blu (with an acquarium in the lobby no less), but I think that the Swissotel, whilst not being a massive world-renowned brand, delivers everything that, say, an InterContinental can deliver (maybe excepting the concierge service), plus the little 'soft' touches that make you feel extra comfortable and welcome. Overall, an impressive hotel with friendly, genuine, staff and a very modern yet homely feel.

I especially appreciated the Vapiano across the street. But, seriously, it is on one of the key shopping streets and 2 blocks from one of the primary transit hubs for the city, zoo garten. The city buses to Tegel airport takes about 15 - 20 minutes for 2.10 Euro and runs every few minutes -- talk about convenient! My room was very spacious and clean. I had a window looking out onto the street and really didn't hear any street noise except for the riot (and I do mean riot) of a whole lot of cars and people making a whole lot of noise for a few hours on Kufurstendamm following Germany's win over Australia in its first game of the World Cup. Such is the price you pay for being in the middle of one of the main squares of the city! I appreciated that it is close to the quaint and quiet old neighborhood of Charlottenburg (sp?) where there are lots of nice cafes, restaurants, bars, and shops. From the zoo garten station you can take a nice double-decker bus to the east/Potsdamer Platz or even rent a bike. One con of this joint is that in-room internet use is VERY expensive. I was told that they have free-of-charge internet computers in the business center, but I didn't use them. Another con is that the fitness center is, well, not really a fitness center. It's 2 bikes, a treadmill, and a stair machine with a single multi-function nautilus machine. I was uber disappointed. But, they did have fresh apples and a water cooler -- which made up for the lack of variety and size. They have a sauna area.

All the other little touches like extra pull out shelves to use, and a lined umbrella holder, really made the room stand out too. Room service and minibar are crazy five star prices, give those a miss - but they have a small quick breakfast option of pastries and hot drink in the lobby for a cheaper morning if you don't want to go the full buffet. However, the full breakfast buffet is lovely, and likewise, in a sunfilled room with a gorgeous floor to ceiling view. It's very European, with not many hot options, but beautiful cheeses, breads, meats, yoghurts, fruit, etc. I've never had anything but excellent service at a Swissotel, and this was no exception - friendly, warm and personal. Valet parking is available under the hotel which is nice, although it is quite difficult to find out the price.

Swissotel is stylish luxury hotel centrally located just off the fashionable Kurfuerstendamm in the heart of Berlin. Here you will find the most amazing array of department stores offering everything from world class chocolate and truffles to regular and designer clothing. Nestled between each department store you will find all the regular European high street stores such as Zara, H&M and Espirit. The hotel in relation to transport networks sits on Zoologischer Garten line of the rail network. Travelling from Schoenefeld airport travellers will leave the airport and walk across the road to the train station. Once inside travellers should take the S9 service to OSTKREUZ - change here and take any of the departing trains towards Zoologischer Garten. You must buy your ticket first at the machines (2.10 Euro's) and then there is a small machine on each platform. IMPORTANT: You must validate your own ticket using these smaller machines on the platform. Their are no guards on board but you may be checked by station guards as you leave the train at your station. As you leave the station you will see a small square dominated by a semi-ruined church (Kaiser Wilhelm memorial church) in front of you. You should walk across the road with the church to your left and walk straight ahead. You will soon be greeted with a large glass structure, with C&A dominating the lowers floors (YES this store still exists in Germany as does Woolworths!) Walk around the corner as you cannot miss the hotel entrance with its welcoming red carpets and topiary dwarf tree's. At first it seems strange to enter a hotel and not be immediately greeted by the reception, however this some how adds to the nicety of the Swissotel Berlin. Once you have taken the lift to the reception you will now experience the high class service of this hotel. The lobby is a relatively spacious space with sleek smooth shaped and edges to fixtures, fittings and furniture, very modern and contemporary. Within the lobby you will find the obvious reception desk and concierge as well as a small snack bar serving a variety of world wines and simple snacks. Back to the checkin.... I have stayed in many, many high end hotels in my profession and I have to say that the sincere and warm service received by reception staff at this hotels indefinitely ranks amongst the highest and best ever. As soon as I was checked in the same staff member showed me around the lobby area and where the bars and restaurants were. He also showed me to my room, taking my bags for me - en route he explained about all the artwork that adorned the walls of the hotel. This type of service is usually for boutique hotels and guest houses only so a wonderful touch for a chain hotel. Once inside the room I was quite surprised by the space. The d\u00e9cor is like the rest of the hotel, modern and contemporary, however unlike many chain hotels it still managed to make the room feel homely and less like a typical hotel. Within the room was two twin beds, which is where my only gripe lies. I do not believe in 2009/2010 any hotel should offer single beds. If a twin is asked for then two doubles should be given, which there was more than enough space in this room. The room itself however was of exceptional quality and immaculately clean. The bathroom is of a quality, which EVERY high end hotel should adhere to. Like everyone has commented on here, the Nespresso machine is a very fine touch to the room and a god send after a looong day of walking and sightseeing. All twin rooms are placed overlooking the courtyard, which in itself is a shame as it is nice to be given a choice, however this doesn't really take away any values. Each floor of the hotel has a different piece of artwork whether it be a painting of sculpture and well worth a look on its own. A FANTASTIC feature of this hotel is the subtle yet effective security the hotel has in place. As well as having small dome cameras in the lobby and public areas nobody can access guest floors without a card from reception, which of course only hand out to guests. You room card doubles up as you access card to your floor. There are NO stairs to guest bedrooms. Each morning myself and friend went down to breakfast in the restaurant and found the service to be once again second to none. Each staff member was ultra attentive whether it be showing you to your table to asking if we would like anything else i.e pancakes etc. At night the restaurant turns in to Restaurant 44, a Michelin starred restaurant that must be tried! I have to be honest and say the only member of staff, which lets down the hotel is sadly the concierge. It is MORE important in a high end hotel that the concierge is attentive and listens well to what the guest is asking. Apart from being quite rude he is also just not very good having been unable to answer several questions either from myself or what other guests have said in conversation. HOWEVER this must not distract from the near perfection of the standard of service from everyone else. If I was to rate this hotel out of 10 then I would say it is a very, very comfortable 8. The reason it is not quite higher is simple because there is no pool or spa facility. I was told by the central reservations team in Canada that the hotel had a pool. In fact it has a fairly small room with 5 pieces of gym kit, a small sauna room and an extra large shower that is all. This is such a shame because I really do not feel that installing a small jacuzzi and possibly pool would take away too much from other areas of the hotel yet make a massive difference. After speaking to a lot of people during my staff almost every guest commented on the lack of pool so it clearly shows how many people expected it. The Swissotel is indefinitely a hotel, which ever visitor to Berlin should consider. In comparison to other high end hotels in Berlin the Swissotel has to be probably one of the nicest. Whilst it is quite generic in looks like most chain hotels it certainly is unique in its quality of staff, high end level of service, god quality food and drink and warmness usually displayed in smaller family run hotels. A WONDERFUL BIRTHDAY STAY THANK YOU SWISSOTEL BERLIN. P.S. It was amazing that on New Years Eve I returned back to my hotel from a morning of sightseeing to get changed for the massive celebrations at the Brandenburg Gate and was greeted by a birthday cake and birthday card from the hotel - AMAZING!!

When sight seeing, we returned to the vicinity of Zoo station to catch the number 100 or 200 buses which came every few minutes and covered all the main sights so we did not waste money on a \"sightseeing bus\". The purchase of a \"Welcome card\" at the tourist info, situation between the station and the hotel, saved us money on museum entries and enabled an easy hop on, hop off on the buses. It can also be used in a number of shops and restaraunts. An earlier trip advisor review mentioned the Italian restaurant opposite the hotel, Vapiano's, and we were not disappointed.

Perfect for business, too (although, as is often the case in Europe, there is no free wireless service). A small business center offers free internet access, however. A lovely, light-filled lobby would be appropriate as a meeting place for business people. Swissotel's location, in the former center of the west, is no longer the center of Berlin, which has moved back to its historic location in the east. We did end up taking some 20-minute Metro rides to go sightseeing, but public transportation is excellent. For shopping, however, the Ku'damm is still outstanding and there are numerous \"normal\" stores (like C&A and drugstores) surrounding this hotel, in case you forget to pack something.

The hotel is in a brilliant spot for access to shops and the local nightlife. Close to the underground system and the main station at Zoogarden. Now, if like me you'd like to know how to get there, it couldn't be easier. if you arriving at Schoenefeld airport simply walk out from arrivals and walk straight to the airports entrance/exit. Once outside if you look to your left you'll see a covered walkway heading north and away from the airport. Walk along the walkway and when prompted take a left down into the basement of the station. Once there you'll notice there isn't a ticket office. Simply walk up to one of the ticket machines and press the language button on the screen so you can begin to understand whats going on. Your destination is Berlin - Zoogarden. The ticket will cost you around 5euros. You will find that the trains the 'airport express' as its called come every half hour. Once you're at Zoogarden walk outside and with the station behind you, go right. Head that way and you should see the hotel after 3-4mins of walking. I do hope that helps.

It's located in a prime position in the heart of the Kurfurstendamm area of Berlin which has plenty of upmarket designer shopping. We flew to Tegel airport and found the easiest way to reach the city centre was to take the express X9 bus from the airport to Zoologischer Garten station. From there it is a 5 minute walk to the hotel. The Zoologischer station is ideal to have nearby, as from there you can jump on the underground (U-Bahn), trains (S-Bahn) or buses. There is also an underground station (Kurfurstendamm) just across the road from the hotel. As well as this, the usual \"hop on hop off\" bus tours depart nearby, so it really is in an excellent part of Berlin from which to do your sight seeing. Once you enter the hotel, you must take the glass lift to the first floor where you will find the reception area, concierge and bar etc. The welcome we had was second to none. The very pleasant and well mannered staff made us feel at home immediately. In fact, throughout our stay, all of the hotel staff were just brilliant and we can't thank them enough for making our holiday a very special one. A nice idea once you enter the glass lift to take you to your room, is that instead of having to insert your card and then press your floor number, you simply swipe your card and the lift automatically goes to the floor you're located on. We booked a classic room with a view over the Kurfurstendamm and ended up on the eighth floor which was perfect. The room was exceptionally clean and spacious with floor to ceiling windows and having a Lavazza coffee machine was a wonderful touch. The bathroom was also spacious with a lovely powerful walk in shower. The bed was extremely comfortable and it was a pleasure to come back and relax in such a room after a hard day's sight seeing! We had to phone down to reception twice during our stay, due to water being needed for the Lavazza coffee machine and for extra milk, and within 3 minutes there was a member of staff knocking the door ready to sort the problem......all with a smile! Berlin is a fabulous city with plenty to see and do and the Vapiano Pizza/Pasta restauraunt across the road comes highly recommended. If you want to stay in a cracker of a hotel which, in my opinion is also very reasonably priced, i would without doubt recommend the Swissotel Berlin.", "Date": "March 9, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Northern Ireland", "Title": "\u201cBrilliant Hotel\u201d", "Author": "PLBNorthernIreland", "ReviewID": "UR24751611", "Content": "A great hotel, everything about it was super.

An all day ticket for buses/trains/underground costs only 6.10 euros. We travelled from Schonefeld airport directly to the Zoological Garten station on the S9 train - very straightforward for getting to the hotel - no fuss and not much over 2 euros each for the journey. The area round about Savingy Platz is great for eating - 12 Apostles was good for pizza and Mr Hai and Friends a great Thai/Vietnamese restaurant - lots of others too.

The bar is small and is fine for a quiet drink. The hotel is situated beside lots of shops and department stores, many of these shops can be found in Ireland and the UK. The KeDeWe department store is Berlin's version of Macy's or Harrods and is definetly worth a visit especially the Food Hall on the 7th floor. There was a a very good Christmas market a few minutes walk from the hotel. It is good fun and you pick up some really unusual items. If you are looking for a bargain it is probably not the place to go as items can be pricey. Even though there is many shops in the area, there is not many restaurants and bars. There is a selection of fast food outlets but not so many restaurants. We found it better to eat in other parts of the city while sightseeing as the selection was better. There is a decent Irish Bar in the Europa Centre about 5 minutes walk from hotel.

One of the highlights is the Lavazza coffee machine, which produces very good coffee! One disadvantage of this coffee machine however is that you are stuck with the selection of coffee and tea provided and there is no option to produce just hot water if you want to use your own tea or coffee. Another minor point is that in a hotel of this class I would have expected to see a flat screen TV, rather than a bulky CRT. The bathroom is also immaculately presented, with a bath tub and also a separate walk-in shower cabin.

Some hopefully helpful tips for Berlin - - The hotel is about 45 min train journey from Schoenfeld Airport on the S Bahn line 9 to Zoogarten. You will need the ticket that covers zones ABC. - Get to know the S Bahn and U Bahn lines as Berlin sprawls so its good to save the shoe leather. Fortunately the hotel is next to a U Bahn line and only 8 min walk from a major U and S Bahn station (Zoogarten). - The Reichstag always has long queues so go early or as we did go late (last entrance is 10pm, we went at 9pm) and in the evening the views and the Copula looks fantastic - For other things to do we found the Holocaust museum very moving, The Brandenburg Gate looks great lit up at night, the Checkpoint Charlie Museum is really interesting and there is lots of shopping to be had if that is your thing. Potsdamer Platz is great and we found loads to do there and the Sony Centre is great and energetic at night especially at the weekend. The Zoo is huge and really well laid out and quite relaxing. Generally there is lots to do in Berlin and as a city it surprised me at how enjoyable and laid back it is. - If food is your thing there is so much to be had including restaurant 44 at the hotel. We were spoilt for choice for food in Berlin, so much variety. - Finally the Berlin Welcome Card is worth a look as it gives you free travel and discounts (normally 25%) at most of the major sites, tours and at some restaurants.

We had arrived early so our room wasn't ready, but they took our luggage and it allowed us to have a wander around the immediate area and get some fresh air after our flight. When we returned to the hotel, we were seen to straight away, taken to the lift by one of the staff and shown how to use it. It may seem a bit pointless, but we encountered more than a few people that didn't know how to use it. The staff were wonderful and for a hotel that is 'upmarket' the staff in no way made you feel intimidated. We had booked a Business Junior Suite through the hotel website and got a good deal including breakfast. The room although nicely furnished and spotless was just a tad on the dull side and could have done with an extra lamp especially next to the reading chair which at night was impossible to use as you couldn't see what you were reading! My real niggle though was that we had a non-smoking room, and throughout the stay we could still smell smoke which seemed to either come through the air conditioning ducts or just wafted along the corridor from the rooms where smoking was permitted. Breakfast on the other hand was amazing. If you couldn't find something to eat at this spread then you have a problem. We decided to treat ourselves to breakfast in bed one morning and on checkout we were pleasantly surprised to find that the only extra cost incurred was 10 Euros. The hotel itself is in a nice area, although some people have mentioned that the station area down the road is seedy. I suppose that the seediness comes from the few sex shops and erotic museum (lol) in that area, but if you're offended by this sort of thing then don't go down there at night. During the day is fine though as its full of Berlin folk and tourists coming and going from the station. Not many of the sights most tourists will want to see are at hand, but the transport system in Berlin is fantastic. Take a few steps outside the hotel and there is a U-Bahn station that will take you to one that has crossover lines taking you all over the city. Or walk for a few minutes and find yourself at a train station with both S-Bahn and U-bahn lines that will take you to all the major sights around the city.

We took a city bus tour and a boat tour which was recommended by the hotel which was very good and inexpensive lasting approx. 4 hours. Public transport is very good either by train or bus. We did not have our children with us but there is lots of activities for children. Berlin Zoo is just of the main street and also the aquarium. The hotel itself is very clean and very well managed with lots of helpful staff. Reading all the comments on the hotel I would not consider it luxurious and I don't think I would consider it 5 star.

When we finally found the entrance to the Swissotel (which is located above the C & A department store on a side street) we were pretty damn pleased with the service. We arrived 4 hours early but were given our room anyway, our baggage was taken up to our room for us, and we were even escorted to the elevators by the gentleman at the desk. Not to mention we received free drink vouchers for a drink they make at the bar out of a variety of juices and special grouse. When we got into the room we were still impressed- HUGE bathtub (you can easily slip two people in there) and really comfortable bed. I was in love after having stayed at the Lindner for a few nights (which is no comparison, seriously). We enjoyed our stay there very much, our only problem came when it was time to check out. We were hastily offered our bags back to us even though check out at our next hotel wasn't for several hours. After some discussion, they agreed to hold on to our bags for us. We spent 1 hour trying to check out because they had to send someone up to our room to validate the minibar charges (which I believe were all of 4 Euro) and there was a HUGE problem with the laundry bill. My boyfriend who had decided to stay an extra four days needed to do laundry and so we were told by the front desk that it could be left out in front of the door and taken care of. We assumed there would be a charge for this, however we were never at any point told that it would be 49 Euro to wash 4 cotton t-shirts and a couple pairs of jeans. We argued with the front desk that we were never informed of the costs associated and that their policy was lunacy. Eventually we realized there was no reasoning with them and paid the bill. We later collected our bags, had them call us a taxi, and the doorman explained to the taxi where we were going after we showed him on paper the address of our next hotel. Turns out the doorman told the taxi driver the wrong thing and we ended up going to a different hotel. After trying to explain this to the driver he insisted that the hotel he had taken us to was what he was told by the doorman. After an arguement, we were finally taken to the correct hotel. So to sum up, here's my advice: Stay at the swissotel if you want a luxury experience- use their free drink vouchers- don't use the minibar- don't do laundry- and don't expect a welcome goodbye.", "Date": "August 29, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "England", "Title": "\u201cfantastic hotel\u201d", "Author": "carrotsarered", "ReviewID": "UR8521598", "Content": "Thank you to all previous reviewers on tripadvisor - this hotel lived up to all those reviews.

There may be hotels with grander public areas, larger rooms and more restaurants, shops and bars but the Swissotel is just the place I feel the most comfortable. The hotel has already been described in detail so I'll just list the things that make this hotel so extraordinary: Perfect staff. From the receptionists to the maids to the staff in the dining room, everyone working there is extremely pleasant, professional and friendly without being sub-servant or chummy. I can't recall ever staying in a hotel where the staff was consistently on such an excellent level, congratulations to the management! Perfect location. While it's true that many of Berlin's attractions are located in Mitte, around Friedrichstrasse and Potsdamer Platz, I vastly prefer the much more real atmosphere of Charlottenburg and the Ku'Damm. Potsdamer Platz is a fun place to visit but it's quite contrived and wasn't formed naturally but by city planners. Explore the lovely side streets, e.g. Uhland- or Knesebeckstrasse of the Ku' damm where you'll find great little restaurants offering Thai, Japanese, Spanish, Italian, Indian and lots of other cuisines, small boutique-style shops like tailors and shoemakers, bars and cafes which cater to the locals and are much more interesting than the chain restaurants and international-brand stores found in Mitte. Perfect room. The standards rooms aren't particularly large but still very pleasant and clean and furnished with everything you could want. A firm matress on the bed, lots of pillows, a Lavazza espresso machine (!), effective and quiet air-conditioning, lots of drawer and closet space, robes and slippers, a small bathroom with great glass-enclosed shower and tub, fast WLAN (for a reasonable fee) etc. The only downside is that I feel so comfortable in the room that I have to force myself to get out and explore Berlin! Perfect breakfast. If you book wisely, you'll be able to get a room that includes breakfast for only 10 Euro more than without. I'm usually not much of a breakfast person and European 5-star hotels tend to charge a fortune for the pleasure. But if yours is included, you won't be disappointed, the breakfast at the Swissotel is fantastic and includes made-to order eggs or pancakes which you can order from your waitress. Much better than those bin full of eggs and bacon so often offered. Perfect restaurant: Many of Berlin's best gourmet restaurants are located in hotels, the Swissotel's Restaurant 44 was awarded a Michelin star and 8 points by Gault Millau and offers very creative and original fare. If you like that kind of food, have lunch during the week where an excellent fixed-menu meal is offered at an extremely reasonable price. My only small criticism stems from the breakfast room sharing it's space with the restaurant. A half an hour before the breakfast service ends, most of the staff gets busy preparing the room for lunch and then things like coffee-refills tend to get a bit difficult. The same thing happens in the evenings if you stay until closing, the staff start preparing the room for breakfast, a rather noisy task which isn't quite fitting for a Michelin-starred restaurant but probably can't be avoided and isn't a major upset.", "Date": "July 7, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "oregon", "Title": "\u201cUpscale and comfortable\u201d", "Author": "lbj2", "ReviewID": "UR8056352", "Content": "We stayed here on our first leg of an Eastern European vacation with my husband and two teens.

June 2007 \u2013 one night I have stayed in several five star hotels in Berlin and the swiss\u00f4tel definitely lives up to the expectations of a high class hotel. From the outside the venue looks rather unspectacular, the entire interior goes with the swiss\u00f4tel standards: understatement, simplistic yet comfortable design. The entrance is very interesting; as you walk in the front door you enter a pretty small lobby with only one small front desk and two glass elevators right across the hall. I approached the staff only to find out that this is the concierge\u2019s desk while the main lobby is upstairs. The elevator takes you right up providing a great few down the wood covered entrance lobby. I received a warm welcome from the front desk employee who checked me inn very promptly. I booked directly with the hotel just a few hours before I arrived, so he first couldn\u2019t find my check inn sheet since it was not printed out yet. That issue was resolved within a few seconds time. He gave me a quick tour of the lobby, showing me the two bars as well as the restaurant. I booked an executive room in the ninth floor, granting access to the executive lounge (but more about that later). One elevator ride later I arrived at the ninth floor making my way to the assigned room 9030. The room itself was spotless, comfortable and nicely appointed (see photos) and featured a spacious working area, sofa chair, queen size bed, TV, mini bar, TV, individual climate controls, two phones and a ironing board (hidden behind a large mirror). I very much liked the individual espresso machine with free espresso pods from Lavazza, surely more hotels should offer that service. The bathroom was also very clean and featured all the necessary goods as shampoo, conditioner, shower gel, bar soap, plenty of towels. Equipped with a bath tub, shower cabin, make up mirror, plenty of towels and toilet. As I arrived early in the afternoon I planned to use the time for some reading in the executive lounge while enjoying a cappuccino or such. As I tried to get in I found the door to be locked, walked back to my room and called the front desk to find out that the lounge wouldn\u2019t open until 6pm. I was disappointed that the lounge is closed for the afternoon, especially since it was mentioned nowhere in the hotel information. I came back shortly after 6pm and was promptly greeted by a very friendly staff. The evening snacks very limited to a choice of soup, some dim sum, bread and smoked cold salmon. All kinds of cold and hot drinks are available. The lounge itself is about the size of a large hotel room, has about eight tables and room for approximately 15 guests. As I found out that night the lounge is only open from 6.30 \u2013 11 am and again from 6 \u2013 10pm, meaning that is closed all the reminder of the time. I had breakfast at the restaurant \u201c44\u201d as it features a wider selection of food than the executive lounge. The food was very good, I didn\u2019t miss anything really, from miso soup, to eggs served your style, assorted breads, freshly squeezed juices, cheese, cereals, waffles, pancakes, tee and coffee. Only the pre-cut fruits, especially the watermelon and cantaloupe were not sweet, ripe and therefore not as tasty as the rest of the food. Also here staff was very friendly and supportive. The hotel also features a small gym and sauna, equipped with some treadmills, bikes and such as well as complimentary mineral water and apple juice. Nothing special, no pool, I\u2019d expect a little more on this end in a five star hotel. The check out was quick and painless, again very friendly personnel helped me to find the best way to my next meeting point. Final thoughts: Overall I enjoyed my stay at the swiss\u00f4tel and would definitely consider staying there again, but probably only if my first two choices are booked out or over priced. Also I would probably not pay the extra for executive lounge access due to its very limited opening hours (not in the afternoon) \u2013 this was really the biggest disappointment. Pros: + central location, main shopping street and restaurants just a short walk away + simple, clean and minimalistic yet still comfortable and pleasant interior design + friendly staff + spacious room with individual espresso machine + great value breakfast (if not included in the rate it\u2019s 21 Euro) Cons: - Executive Lounge only open for four hours in the morning and four hours at night - not worth the extra money - very small fitness center - no swimming pool", "Date": "June 28, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "4", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Stockholm, Sweden", "Title": "\u201cgood hotel\u201d", "Author": "screenname060309", "ReviewID": "UR7975782", "Content": "We just returned from our first visit to Berlin.

The service was excellent throughout. In particular Henry, who served us drinks in the bar near reception - upon hearing of our lengthy overnight train trip home, he went off and then came back with a specially wrapped bag of delicious Swissotel chocolate for us to eat on our journey. I would agree that the location is not the best in Berlin - the area near Zoologischer Garten station is a little seedy, but the Ku'damm -close by - is a fine, upmarket shopping street. I would be very tempted to stay nearer Mitte on a future stay, the area around Potsdamer Platz is particularly well-placed for the sights. Wherever you stay in Berlin though, you will at some point need to make use of the excellent public transport system - 6.20 Euros will get you a day ticket with unlimited use. Tips on food - the self-service Vapiano across the road serves excellent pizzas, pastas and salads for a very reasonable price. Zur Letzten Instanz, close the the TV tower, is reputedly the oldest restaurant in Berlin and serves hearty German food - eat in the garden if the weather's good.

The view of the city was amazing. The textiles were luxurious. The complimentary toiletries were lovely. There was even an umbrella in the room for the use of guests during their stay. While it was lovely being upgraded, we think the facilities would be the same in the standard rooms.

However, we booked on the hotel's own website and paid 135 euros including breakfast. Our waitress 'Diana' was charming, as was every member of staff we encountered during our four days. This hotel is well managed and represents outstanding value. The weather was awful - but Berlin was fab ! We loved the history, shopping, superb quality food and the very relaxed feel of the German capital and its people. We used the overground train from the airport (Shoenefeld) and walked from Zoo Gardens. Buying a ticket was problematic though - big, big queues at the machines and no one at hand to help, except fellow travellers. Next time buy tickets at airport from a machine or the newsagent (2 euros 10 cents) and don't forget to validate it, or risk a 40 euro fine. We also used the 100 and 200 buses during our stay - buy ticket from driver - no problem. See everywhere from the top and get on and off where you wish (one direction only) for 2.10 euros - a bargain ! Vapiano restaurant (opposite hotel) was good value and serves excellent salads, pizzas and pastas all made freshly for you before your eyes ! Foodhall at KadeWe amazing and much cheaper than Harrods. C & A still in business in Berlin and a landmark for our hotel. I could write more, but the previous reviewers say it all - give Berlin a go - you'll be impressed.

The hotel had also changed the duvet cover to white with red roses to add a touch of romance to the room. Very nice touch indeed.

We booked the executive room option - but contrary to other reports, I think it is over-rated at this hotel. I am familiar with this at the Swissotel in Beijing and the differences are substantial. We only used the tiny executive lounge for breakfast -which was quite good. The room is a lesson in details. This company knows what their customers want because they listen! The only thing we didn't like is the lack of pillow selection. It would be nice to have the option of ordering a pillow like at other Hotels. Otherwise everything you need (and don't need) is there: Safe, iron, ironing board, coffee machine, mini-bar, toiletries, plenty of towels, paper clips, pencil, pencil sharpener and eraser! Even found a ruler in one of the drawers. I used the fitness room and found everything I needed. Well stocked and again, a real attention to details. I really appreciated the menthol soaked towels in the fridge, the apfelschorle, the personal video units (bring your own headphones) available on the treadmill, stepper and bikes. Everything was there for the shower afterwards (and I mean EVERYTHING). The only disappointment was the coin operated lockers....what's up with that? I didn't have a coin on me, but found that kind of silly anyway. The location of the hotel is excellent. Shopping non-plus-ultra right around the corner. It's only a 10 minute walk to Ka-De-We. The U-bahn (subway) is about 50 meters from the entrance of the hotel - same goes for the buses, be it a tourist or normal bus. Why didn't I give it \"Excellent\"? The executive floors aren't quite up to the comparison with the Beijing Swissotel: No separate check-in, lounge too small and the room not as impressive. The staff is really good - although the friendliness of the counter staff borders on ridiculous as the authenticity seems to be a stretch for some. Others bring it across with ease like the gentleman - didn't get his name - from Hamburg manning the executive lounge on Saturday 30.09 in the afternoon. He was outstanding: authentically friendly, professional and helpful. A great hotel, but more importantly, excellent service. Just one more example of service excellence - all you other hotels pay attention: My wife and I walked outside the hotel and asked the doorman about the city tour buses. He told us we could get more information as well as the tickets from the concierge. We went back into the hotel and took the glass elevator up to the lobby. While riding up I saw the doorman pull out his cell phone and make a call. When we arrived at the concierge desk, the concierge was just hanging up the phone and had the brochure for the bus tours in his hand - waiting for us.

Unfortunately, this is not for a drink of choice but a pre-mixed, horribly sweet concoction out of the depths of the fridge. It's nothing worth remembering and we were kind of disappointed by this. Further, when we did get up to the room, we were disappointed about how small it was. We had a basic double, but the same type of room at the Inter-Conti or SchweizerHof in Berlin is much bigger. Everyone was so excited about the espresso machine. Folks, it's really not a big deal and the coffee provided really isn't that good! Further, the bathroom is boring and nothing out of the ordinary. The location is good if you are up for shopping on the Kudamm right outside, but where it's at right now is Mitte, and that's too far from this hotel! Finally, the average age of the clientel is significantly higher than expected. On a weekend, I would guess the average age to be somewhere around 40.

Overall I would not stay here again due to the cost and the lack of a comfortable atmosphere. I booked two rooms and emailed the hotel in advance asking for rooms as close together as possible. They replied swiftly assuring me that they had noted our request and had arrange for two rooms very close together. On arriving they denied all knowledge of this and had allocated two rooms two floors apart! This caused no end of problems and one evening when my younger son wanted to pop up to see my older son, resulted in him being stuck on a floor. They give you cards that only allow you to go to the floor where your room is located which is good for personal safety but they gave us additional cards so that we could all go to both floors. However these cards don't work properly and my poor 12 yr old son was stuck on the top floor and got so worried that it didn't cross his mind that he could go down the lobby. He made 3 calls to reception and no-one offered him any help. Finally he realised he might be able to go down, so got in the lift and went to reception. Not one word of apology for the cards not working properly and for them not giving him any assistance. If any families are booking here I would be very careful about be allocated different floors. And whatever age your child is, don't allow them to use the lift system on their own...even if they are teenagers. On arriving one room was turned down and had fruit and a note from the manager welcoming us, the other room hadn't been touched. A call to the manager ensured the arrival of someone to sort the room out. The safe also jammed in one of the rooms but they did attend to this swiftly and apologised. The rooms are comfortable and the bathroom was really lovely. There is plenty of space to hang clothes but unfortunately only a coffee making machine in the room. We used quite a lot of the mini bar but found that we weren't ripped off by the prices. The other big let down is the lounge area. It took over 20 minutes for me to get a small glass of red wine and there was only me and two other guests there! And then I was ripped off by being charged 12 euros for a very small glass of wine. I didn't notice until I got home because my husband paid the bill when he arrived back at the hotel. I found the hotel functional, but for the price had a distinct lack of customer focus.

The spa was clean and well provided for, although the gym was more of a corridor with a few machines threwn in than a suitable exercising place. I am afraid the the KuDam has never been my favourite place in Berlin, so the location was not what I would see as the hotel strong point. There is a strong feeling that the center of Berlin is now shifting back towards unter den Linden, and I would recommend to anyone travelling to Berlin to look for a hotel in that area, and avoid at all costs the dreadfully commercial and dull area around the Zoologisher station. In short, I would not stay there again, but would rather look for something less corporate, closer to Unter den Linden. At any rate I would not stay there unless paying only 50% of the listed price.

(As a New Yorker who travels a great deal, I'm very conscious of safety in big cities). Also, the hotel is very big and has lots of empty lobby-floor space (full of many smokers, but it's Europe!). BUT the advertised health club is a dinky little room, crowded and unbelievably hot and the water cooler was frequently empty. Next room was a nice place to relax after exercise, but the exercise room was so tiny and hot and unpleasant and this was very frustrating, especially on a rainy morning. so I didn't want to go anymore. There's no pool or jacuzzi, and if you're eating a lot you really need a place to exercise! By the way, in my opinion, Berlin is really overrated, in comparison with a lot of cities.

Room: We stayed on the 9th floor, the executive room floor. It was well worth the extra money. Room was light and just big enough, though we did miss a bigger wardrobe and the bed was a bit on the hard side. As in other Swiss hotels, we enjoyed the espresso machine and a well stocked minibar. The room also proved to be practially sound-proof, as the VERY celebrating football teams outside were not to be heard inside. Service was very good, timely and the turn-down service was also very professional. Food: There is a separate executive lounge on the 9th floor, serving breakfast and other smaller snacks and meals throughout the day, included in the price, also wine and liquor. Buddha Bar music playing on the B&O, modern and light furniture and good service. It's a bit on the small side, so personally, I would have preferred it to be non-smoking.... Restaurant 44: we had lunch on a very hot Saturday out on the terrace. Food was very nice, we tried the red mullet, the fois grois and the vegetarian ravioli dish. The desserts were to die for! Really high class! Service was good and friendly, and there was no rush, and the atmosphere on top of Berlin is just great! We received a 15% discount as guests of the hotel. Bars: We only tried the bar itself, not the lobby lounge. Late night. Very friendly service and good choice, though the Mojtoes would benefit from more sugar :o) Location: Very good, next door to Ku'dam and only a short walk to good shopping and interesting sites. The double decker sightseeing buses stop only a block away, and proved to be an excellent choice in 35 degrees sunshine. Stealing staff: Both the receptionists and the concierge were very friendly and attentive. I praised them when departing and filled out a \"Excellent 5 star service form\". HOWEVER, while in the car on our way to the airport, we discover we had left some German delicasies we had acquried and intended to bring home, in the minibar. We called the hotel immediately and explained the situation. They promised to look for it, but we were later in the day told that they could not find it, after we called again to check. So obviously, the housekeeping staff had a feast on it.... For a 5 star hotel, this is VERY disappointing! Long fingers are not exactly \"Service to your fingertips!\" This did reduce the otherwise luxury weekend feeling of the Swiss hotel Berlin. And I believe, for a 5 star hotel, to offer us a compensation or a reduced price on our next visit, would have been a nice gesture, and there would be no hard feelings. But they did not.

The hotel has its own lounge area, which is smart but also open plan; there are no cosy nooks here. We ate in the hotel restaurant twice, once with great success having chosen the 4 course set menu with selected wines. This was quite delicious. The second time was less successful: rather tasteless salad, over-salty lamb, none-too-warm vegetables. Perhaps the chef is a little too ambitious or was having an off night.

The hotel is superbly located on the Ku'damm, 100 yards from the U-bahn and only a little further from one of Berlin's most famous landmarks: the Kaiser Wilhelm Ged\u00e4chtniskirche. In fact, the building is a bit of a landmark in itself too, with its futuristic exterior styling and with over one hundred works of modern art displayed throughout its 7 floors! The standard rooms are exactly what you'd expect from a 5* city hotel; spacious, nice marble bathroom, plenty of wardrobe space, etc. There is also a gourmet restaurant, but this can be quite expensive, especially if you're on a budget.

(So close a taxi refused to take us there on arrival in the rain, but it didn't matter!)

The breakfasts are excellent, there is free internet access in the lobby for those who aren't business travellers with laptops, an espresso coffee machine in the room, large comfortable rooms, good security for floors, etc. Do bear in mind however that this is a business hotel - which means there will be convention/conference groups. With no offence intended to the previous traveller, they can tend to take over the lobby when you are there, and it is difficult to get a quiet drink in the lobby bar at certain times of the day! A note - as we left, it again started to rain. We were heading for the train station, and the doorman asked us to wait, and reappeared with two large Swissotel umbrellas. When we protested that we could not return them, he shrugged and said never mind! That is the kind of service you expect from an excellent 5 star hotel like this. We booked on the Swissotel website, and got a good rate of 165 Euro for a business room, with a street view, bkfast included.
