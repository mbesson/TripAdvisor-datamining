{"Reviews": [{"Content": "Not at all like the photos! Stayed here during the world cup in June, and was surprised upon arrival to see that the entrance is not at all like the one in all the photos. We had booked a double room, but had been given a twin room, which was abolutely tiny, and the beds were round the corner from one another. I went and spoke to reception about this and they put us in a much bigger and better double room, although they were far from cheerful about this. The room itself was fine, clean and tidy. Do not, however, think that you will get a room as big as the one in the photographs with a sofa in it. The bathroom was clean, but very old, tired and small- similar to a caravan bathroom. There were none of the extras promised eg newspaper, hairdryer, fridge etc. I suggest if you do want these to confirm them on arrival. The room was 3 floors above the street, but was still very noisy at night, and not air conditioned. Hotel Consul was functional, clean, close to the station, and mostly pleasant staff. If however, you are wanting to see a lot of the old town I think this hotel is too far away. The street it is on is not very nice, and I wouldn't want to walk down it or neighbouring streets by myself at night. A good place to stay if you don't want to spend much, or won't spend much time there, but it is not luxury by any means. Fine for a night or two, but don't expect much.", "Date": "Aug 16, 2006", "ReviewID": "UR841731572", "Ratings": {"Service": "-1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "-1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "2", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "-1", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "mjma"}, {"Content": "so, so the hotel is close to the main train station with some cool restaurants nearby on the road parallel closer to the train station.If you stay in the rooms next to the road prepare for alot of noise from traffic, drunkards, sirens etc..The room is of a good size with a fridge, TV and decent shower. The breakfast was reasonable. The down side is, if it's hot outside the room is even hotter inside with only a fan to help. The maid only provided tea and cooffee on the first day and did not replenish stocks.", "Date": "Aug 1, 2006", "ReviewID": "UR904990892", "Ratings": {"Service": "-1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "-1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "3", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "-1", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "oovavoo"}, {"Content": "Functional Hotel Stayed at this hotel during the World Cup and booked it directly through FIFA. My first impressions were disappointing as the hotel looked a lot more tired than the photos I'd seen on the internet. The descriptions of the hotel also stated that rooms had the following: desk, internet connection, hairdryer and that complimentary newspapers were available over coffee or breakfast. All I can say is that they must have hidden all these well!On the plus side, the hotel is less than 10 minutes to the railway station and there was a really lovely Italian restaurant just around the corner, where several Italian journalists  tv presenters who were there for the World Cup went to. The hotel was basic but clean, although the bathroom was a little dingy and had no natural light.Breakfast was decent with a selection of cereals, breads, meats, cheeses, yoghurts etc and you could help yourself to whatever you wanted. The hotel has no bar but sells cans of beer, which you can keep in the very efficient fridge in your room.When we arrived we were given a choice of 2 rooms. The first was at the back and rather small and the second was at the front and extremely spacious. We chose the larger room but that turned out to be a mistake. It was very noisy so we had to keep the windows closed at night, which meant we baked, even though we had a portable fan. There was also police/ambulance sirens that kept us awake during the night too. I think the room at the back, away from the main road, would have been much quieter and perhaps a little cooler.All in all, the hotel was alright. It was functional and served a purpose. I can't say it was value for money as we went during the World Cup when nothing was cheap. However, a similar break at this hotel at any other time costs about a third of what we paid so would probably normally be good value.Hotel Consul is described as a 3* but in my opinion it is most definitely only a 2*. I wouldn't choose to stay here again because I usually prefer 4* hotels, but for a 2* I'd rate it as being quite decent.", "Date": "Jun 27, 2006", "ReviewID": "UR463107768", "Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "3", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "Ailie-J"}, {"Content": "Friendly and Clean Very nice place.
