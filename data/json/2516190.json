So I feel I can give a good, balanced comparison of some options you may be cross-shopping up here for your trip. There are three resorts we have visited that all seem to target a similar market/demographic. Solage is the newest of these three, and is targeting a price-range between, say, $500-$1000 per night in individual free-standing \"studios\", with lots of nice facilities and luxury. The closest comparison is probably The Carneros Inn on the extreme opposite end of the Valley. Of the two, I think Solage is the winner. Its smaller and more intimate, and I think has the better location. Price-wise I think they tend to come out about the same. Both are clearly following the same template - modern-style construction, individual rooms, nice pool area, spa, restaurant, good service. I think Solage has the nicer spa, a few more nice service features, and a nicer little corner of the valley it occupies. From the same operator and slightly higher-cost is Calistoga Ranch. Its a true \"sister property\" located a short hop away on the same road, but the focus at Calistoga Ranch is definitely more about privacy and pleasant surroundings, and less about the restaurant, spa, or pool facilities (although it has all those things). Calistoga Ranch is a bit older property, and a bit costlier generally. For me, Calistoga Ranch is a very unique and relaxing place. The room designs are very unique with two portions of the room separated by an outdoor space, private hot-tubs, etc. And the sloped property with old growth trees, really feels like you've escaped everything. And its a smaller property which means more individual service, and more attention from the concierge. But back to Solage. Having had previous experience with Auberge properties I expected pre-visit service in the form of emails with the concierge, spa, etc. This did happen, but I waiting a bit too long (day before) to make some requests, and the concierge was not able to make everything happen as smoothly as he could have if I had perhaps given more advance notice. I can't fault him here. He WAS able to get us dinner reservations at Solbar when it was fully booked, but not at our first choice of time. The property itself was nice, very reminiscent of Carneros Inn in terms of architecture. Lots of white wood, modern lines, greenery. As with Carneros it still has a bit of a \"tract housing\" feel for me that doesn't project warmth, but its perfectly nice. They have a rather odd solution to the \"you can near your room\" issue when checking in. One of the desk staff bikes to your room and you follow in your car. Felt weird, but I can't really suggest a better way. Carneros has the same issue and just simply didn't bother. I think Solage is trying hard to meet that 5-star service level. Whenever you pass by staff on the property they say hello and greet you nicely (a very Four Seasons thing). However, I think they felt short a bit when the desk person who showed us to our room asked \"Do you want me to show you to your room\" or \"can I help you with your bags\". Its nit-picky, but I think to really hit the service level expected here they should just go ahead and do all these things and leave it to me to say no, rather than offering this as a \"yes/no\", because I think the subtext is always \"please say no\". Something for the next round of training! We booked a Suite here because it offered a private hot-tub, and I was hoping for a fair comparison to our stay at Calistoga Ranch which has a preponderance of private-spa-equipped rooms. Also we find we get good value from this in our room. The spa and suite did not disappoint. Unexpectedly instead of a typical plastic & wood \"Hot tub\" it was a full-blown in-ground spa like you'd expect in the main pool area; very nice, high marks. We used it 3-4 times in a one night stay it was so hot, clean, and relaxing. We were also pleased to find now one but TWO bottles of wine waiting on ice for us in the room, despite not ordering anything. One sparkling and one white, neither anything special but a nice touch and much preferred to a fruit place, especially in Napa. A good combination with the hot tub. Other high notes - a chance to meet & chat with their Sommelier at 3pm on Saturdays (do it, very fun) and the cocktail menu & bartenders at Sol Bar. We ate at Sol Bar and the food was good, not epic. Service was good as well. I wouldn't say the restaurant was such a highlight that I would make a trip just for that. I DO wish I had spent more time trying different cocktails at the bar and the bar food menu looked REALLY exciting, I wish I had tried more of it. The bar & restaurant and both very nice, airy, and open and a pleasant place to hang out. Even if you're not staying here, I think its worth a visit if you're at the north end of the valley. The Spa was nice, definitely a step above most resort spas in this area. Huge hot mineral water pool, great cabanas (limited number!). Any guest can use the spa facilities including the hot springs pool, which is comparable in size and much nicer than the \"official\" pool outside Sol Bar. There's a kids pool as well, which ironically is much smaller than, but much more heavily used than, the main pool. But either way, all the pools are nice, big, and well maintained. The scenery here is good, not epic. Its in a nice narrow part of the valley so you have mountain views in any direction, but the resort itself doesn't have any elevation, so you don't get those great wide vistas you might get further up the slopes at like Calisoga Ranch or Auberge de Soleil. So bottom line - which to choose next time? If you are looking to relax and be a bit anti-social, there is nothing like Calisotga Ranch. It feels very luxe, private, and relaxing. If you want a bit more activity, I would go with Solage over Carneros Inn. The service level feels a notch higher, the property is smaller and more private, and the facilities are all top-notch. They also retained a lot of the amenities from Calistoga Ranch like free use of Mercedes Cars, the bikes, and generally excellent concierge service. I still want to check out Meadowood and Auberge (the original property from this operator).", "Date": "April 17, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Granite Bay, CA", "Title": "\u201cWonderful Getaway\u201d", "Author": "CA_Vacationer", "ReviewID": "UR128027387", "Content": "We have been here a few times while attending a conference for my husband's company.

If I were the owner, I'd insist the manager be all over the place. As noted, I've been at Solage a lot, and made an effort to seek out someone who looked like management. But never saw anyone like that. I'd hire a landscape architect to dress up the place a bit. This may seem odd, but the place needs some mature trees. There really is no lobby, so it seems a little cold; that is, nowhere to get the feel of the place. It looks sterile but professional. Concrete floors. I'd also bring in some employee training on being warm and unpretentious. Avoid room 7 if you want privacy. Positives? I've had some excellent meals there. \"Locals night\" around the fire pit is great for conversations. Beds are heavenly. Decks are relaxing. Some employees do try hard to please.

As usual, I spent too much time focusing on the not so good comments on TA before we went. I can say that our own personal experience was great though. It is for sure not cheap, but you also get what you pay for I guess. I was a little disappointed when we first got there to see we were at the \"back of the lot\", but as I was checking in, there was a rather loud wedding going on (to be expected), and we were more than happy to get something that was peaceful and quiet. The distance was no problem, and was only a short walk, or literally 30 seconds on the bikes provided for each cabin. The restaurant was nice, but again pricey. I would say it's a nice place to start your day with breakfast, but there are so many choices in Calistoga (5 minute bike ride) that I would probably choose to dine in town. Some people commented on it being a long way from Napa, but if you have a car, it's not a big deal. I would say that the area around Calistoga is as nice or nicer than Napa. Has lots of great wineries, and is just as scenic. My wife had a spa treatment and said she had a great time (she's been to many so she would know) The room itself was different, but very nice. Not huge, but cozy with great beds and pillows.

My wife HAD to buy some at the spa before we left. The cement floors in the rooms can be a little cool, but slippers are provided. The rainfall shower was great, although it never seemed to get quite hot enough for us. Just one last comment that I have to mention pertaining to what others were saying about the grounds and landscaping at Solage. It is not \"undone\" but rather planted to fit in with the natural surroundings.

The room is contemporary Cali style, with an uncluttered, clean feel, soothing colors and textures, and high-end amenities--from the fluffy robes, towels, and slippers, to the toiletries, to the custom lighting settings, and extremely comfortable bed with crisp white linens. Wi-Fi was excellent. The room was quiet, private, and just oozed mellow. We dined at Solbar several times; our package included daily breakfast and one full dinner. The food was sublimely Napa-esque: fresh and high-quality ingredients, absolutely delicious, and beautifully prepared. Like all excellent places in Napa Valley, they had a fabulous selection of wines and cocktails. Don't miss the made-to-order donut holes and dipping sauces, or the seared scallops, the beet salad, the wagyu beef...I could go on and on! We ate at the bar, inside, and on the patio--each one a lovely experience. We used the fitness room a couple of times, as well as the two different pool areas--very nice.

None of the cottage windows face that way, but it's a reminder that Calistoga is a functional little town and Solage is not a secluded retreat. But everything else was pretty darned wonderful. Some highlights: * Mudslide treatment for two, at the spa, was really fun, and a relative bargain for the amount of playful couples relaxation. It's nothing like the sulfurous-smelling mud bath treatments that the traditional -- OK, California Hippie -- spas in the area are known for. Linger at the pool afterwards. * Taking the cottage bikes for a jaunt into town. * Joyriding in the house Mercedes E550 coupe.

We originally planned on staying at Mt View in downtown Calistoga, but it was booked up for the rooms that would accommodate 4 ladies and boy, were we glad that we ended up at Solage! This place is beautiful! The ONLY reason why I'm not giving it a 5 star rating is because some of the staff was a bit stuffy, however the majority were wonderful! Rooms- The layout is the first thing that sets it apart. Its a room, but it's actually your own little cottage with two cruiser bikes to use at your leisure. Every room had a patio with a sitting area and a great view. There was some weird prairie grass mess that surrounded our patio. Im sure it was some kind of attempt at making it look rustic-chic, but in my opinion, it wasn't aesthetically pleasing and at one point we heard some kind of animal moving around in it. (luckily, we never had the pleasure of meeting said animal). The beds were comfy and the room itself had plenty of space for four ladies and our luggage. The bathroom was nice and big, but I really wish they had a bathtub! The bath amenities smelled great and were from a local place, but none of us liked how the shampoo and conditioner made our hair feel, so bring your own. (the soap and lotion were just fine and all amenities were full size bottles). We all loved that there was a coffee maker with a jar of coffee from a local shop, as well as an electric kettle to make tea! Yum! (the tropical green was a favorite!) They also give you a complimentary reusable tote to take with you, some snacks like trail mix to munch on and a bottle of wine that was pretty good. Most importantly, it was nice and clean! The Spa- Ahhh-Mazing!!!! We didn't want to leave! We did the mud slide treatment which was wonderful - we had our own sauna room set up for the four of us (which was nice because this treatment is best done in the nude) so we didn't have to feel all awkward in front of strangers. They give you cucumbers for your eyes and delicious flavored ice water. Then, after you shower off the mud, they take you to a warm scented bath to relax in and finally, the anti-gravity, sound vibration chair. Two of us loved it and fell asleep - the other two thought the chair was just ok. We all had massages later in our stay and those were wonderful. Our favorite part of the spa was the warm mineral pool surrounded by olive trees and peaceful serenity. They tap into the local hot spring water and this pool was the PERFECT temp! They also have separate men's and women's lounge areas where you can lay by a large hot tub (sans clothes if you so choose) or sit in the eucalyptus steam room and then run out and jump into the little cold plunge pool - it was quite exhilarating! Lastly, the spa food and drinks were delicious, so have some!! Solbar - We had a couple of us in our group with food sensitivities and we were always able to find something delicious to eat. The fresh fruit juice in the morning was incredible. (the pear was my fav). If you like oatmeal, it's not to be missed here. Seriously, we all loved our breakfast every morning. We had dinner and drinks on the patio. The food was amazing (I think the best dinner we had and we tried a new place each night) and the wine impeccable. It was a little chilly out and not only did they bring us our own heater, but the manager came and wrapped a pashmina around me to use while I was sitting there. I loved it so much that I bought one from him! The only negative thing I can say is that although it's a very nice place, you still need to keep an eye on your things! You tend to get a bit relaxed - everyone here looks like they stepped out of a J Crew catalog and everyone is nice and there to enjoy themselves. However, we did have one incident where we were laying by the main pool and the young bartender was feeding us free drinks. Who am I to complain - this place isn't cheap, so if you want to load us up with free drinks...ok. Though, I think we MAY have been taken. At one point we noticed the bartender talking to some guy that appeared to be a local - definitely not a guest a the hotel. You need your room key to access the pool and he did come in when a guest was leaving. We were enjoying ourselves and our bag was a few feet away. Two of us grabbed what we though was all of our things and headed back to the room while the other two hung out by the hot tub. Long story short, someone stole our bag. So, I would just keep an eye on your things. I'm hoping this was just an isolated instance and it shouldn't deter anyone from staying here - the place is great!

The property is within walking distance of downtown Calistoga. Our cottage was very nice with a comfortable bed and linens and a modern vibe. It's the extras that make a vacation for me, and I love that the room comes with a coffee maker, ground coffee (not packaged), tea, sugar and creamers in the fridge. The room also has an ipod docking station and magazines. And we received bottled waters for the road when we checked out. We booked the romance package, which included credits for dinner and breakfast at the Solbar. We have eaten there several times, and each time the food has been fabulous. (Michelin agrees with me.) The bacon is some of the best I've ever had. My only nitpicky comments are (1) that we had to call the bar from our cellphone to order drinks by the pool. I guess poolside service was discontinued for the season. It wasn't a big deal to walk the few yards from the pool to the bar, but for $500+ a night it would be nice to get a drink by the pool whenever I darn well feel like it (especially since the pool/hot tub is such a draw of the resort for me); and (2) the cottages are so close that I didn't feel like sitting out on the patio due to lack of privacy.

I have been so impressed with the service and our stay that I figured I should write this post while it is still fresh! We are staying a total of 6 days at the Solage over the new year holiday and into the first week of January and our experience here has been nothing short of fantastic. We are staying in a Vega studio just behind the gym and spa buildings with views of the mountains. The Vega studio is a great space. The layout is fantastic, with a somewhat minimalist and comfortable design. The shower has great pressure and the stone floor in the shower is amazing. The mini-bar area is stocked with complimentary coffee and creamer, from a local roaster. There is free wifi, a flatscreen, and a great outdoor patio with seating. The entire grounds have been laid out and designed to feel even bigger than they actually are. The fresh, clean look of the buildings combined with the barn like feel creates a perfectly relaxing atmosphere. The hot pools, especially since it is January here, are fantastic and while we haven't made use of the main pool or bocce ball courts, they are well kept and we have seen many people using them. The best part of our stay, however, has been the personal touches. The staff is welcoming and friendly. We checked in on New Years Eve and decided to eat at the Sol Bar. Just before our meal, a staff person dropped off a \"hangover kit\" at our room in a cute little bag filled with gatorade, water, advil, etc. A very nice touch! We had a very good meal. The wine pairings were great, in particular, we had two really nice pairings of Stoney Hill Chardonnay with a scallops dish and Heitz Cabernet Sauvignon with a kobe beef dish. Our server was incredibly accomodating and allowed what would have been a four course sharing into an 8 course sharing. The ambiance is gorgeous inside. The bar area is also a good size and the mixed drinks are supposed to be very good. After dinner, we came back to a bottle of champagne and some food in our room, a total surprise from the Solage. They also deliver fresh mint water at night in great little milk jars and lay out a thought of the day on your bed. Last but not least, the spa and gym. My boyfriend and I have both used the gym facility every day so far. It is small but completely adequate. Clean, well kept, new machines. The treadmills and ellipticals have t.v.'s attached and there is a good size free weights area. They offer daily classes in a studio area next door though neither of us have taken them. My boyfriend got a massage at the spa and it lived up to all the hype. The spa facilities are fantastic. It is calm and serene. The locker rooms are sizable and there are also phenomenal steam rooms for both men and women. The only possible downside is that it is in Calistoga, tucked a bit away. But it is located right on the Silverado Trail which is gorgeous and we have loved being just a bit outside the rush and main mix. It is a quick 15-20 minute drive to St. Helena, easy to get to Healdsburg and the drive down Silverado to Rutherford, Yountville, Napa, etc is 30-45 minutes depending where you are headed. We haven't minded the location at all but could understand how others might want to be closer to St. Helena or elsewhere. I am sure I am forgetting some of the details of our stay but we cannot recommend the Solage enough. As one last aside, it looks like the management did respond to past comments and there are now ipod docking stations in all of the rooms, a very nice touch!

I had carefully researched our choice of venue, and was looking for a modern yet peaceful escape. We booked the \"girl's getaway\" package, which is a bit of a splurge, and we had pretty high expectations. The resort is simple, modern and polished. It is minimalist in design, and the 89 bungalows are spread out over the property - our hope was for a quiet, classy weekend enjoying the amenities and the gorgeous surroundings. Our initial impression, however, was the exact opposite of what we were looking for. We arrived at 4pm on Friday afternoon after having driven from San Francisco, and the lobby was absolute chaos. We waited for a couple minutes to check in, and while the guest service agent was trying to be courteous and helpful, there were two couples checking in beside us were obviously quite intoxicated (too much wine tasting perhaps), very loud and totally obnoxious. We couldn't hear the guest service agent at all and even got pushed aside by one of the women. We waited for this group to leave, then finished our check in. All in all, NOT a peaceful experience. It is obviously not the hotel's fault that this group was loud if this is the type of clientele the Solage attracts, we would not find what we were looking for (and had paid top dollar for). After settling to our room, we started to relax a little more and were really delighted by the property. It has the propensity to be very peaceful. The bungalows are beautifully decorated, extremely modern, spacious and very comfortable. The rooms are decorated in earthy, cool tones and have large slate bathrooms, simple furniture, complimentary cruiser bikes and private patios. Luckily, the property is spread out and very spacious, and our bungalow was very peaceful. The common areas, however, were really crowded and the \"lobby crowd\" could be heard from the pool all the way into the lounge. The hotel did apologize for the less-than-stellar arrival, but unless they manage the expectations of their clientele, this will continue to be an issue. We wanted an escape, not a party hotel. We had a couple more service issues in the spa, which were really unfortunate, because I really wanted to love the Solage. It has all the trappings of a perfect retreat - beautiful decor, incredible location, great food. The pool and common areas are beautiful, and the hotel is even pet friendly! However, the staff just seemed to be a little overwhelmed (there seemed to be a couple Christmas parties and it was very busy). My friend and I were \"accidentally\" booked into the same treatment room for our spa treatment, which was pretty awkward. The spa staff rectified it by staggering our appointments, but then unfortunately completely forgot about me. I waited in the treatment room for 15 minutes before realizing they were never coming back. At that point, I had been in the spa for over an hour waiting and was fed up. My impression was that the spa and the hotel were just too busy for the staffing levels. If the service glitches can get solved, this will be an incredible property. I would definitely go back in the low season because this is a property that deserves to be relished. I would be very hesitant, however, to book in high season because the amenities just do not seem to have the capacity, not if you are looking for an exceptional experience.

Pros: great restaurant (good outdoor seating), three pools (one large adult pool, one mineral pool at the spa, and one children's pool). Despite being 95+ degrees every day, the adult pool was chilly (so-so service at the pool). The mineral pool was much warmer, but very subdued (spa atmosphere). The fitness center was tops...tons of cardio equipment, free weights, and weight machines. Might have been the best hotel gym I've ever seen. For the most part, service was top-notch (to be expected for such a hotel). The room was about $600/night.

We also did the relaxation chairs - again, interesting but would not splurge for this treatment again. August Briggs vineyard was just down the road - this is a little gem of a vineyard. Calistoga is a bit off the beaten track, but for us, we needed the space to recharge. We had dinner closer to the heart of Napa and used the hotel arranged car service.

Where to start? Firstly, this is one of the best resorts we have ever stayed in, hands down. Secondly, if you are travelling to San Francisco from Australia and want to include the Napa Valley on your itinerary I cannot recommend enough that you hire a car and drive up to Calistoga for a few days and that you stay at Solage. It will beat any day trip that a travel brochure will describe. Okay, let's break it down. Arrival/Check-in Seamless, friendly, professional. As soon as we parked our car we were greeted by a bellman who ushered us into reception and offered us cold towels and water (it was hot out). We already received a pre arrival email from the spa and concierge so made bookings for treatments and dinner prior to arriving which were confirmed at checking. The same bellman then asked us to follow him as he cycled to where out studio was. He helped us unpack, talked us through the features of the room and resort and suggested some places in town for dinner. Our Room We booked a Vega Studio which was perfect - very close to the fitness centre and spa. The room was very modern - king bed, locally made amenities in the bathroom, large double shower, great selection of tea and coffee and an outdoor terrace that opened onto a large area of trees. Also worth mentioning the free, resort wide wifi coverage as well. Perfect for seamless connectivity whether you are in your room of by the pool. We had daily maid service and an evening turndown service. Again, a lovely touch in that the bottled water provided are in reusable glass bottles and are flavoured with citrus and cucumber. We loved that each room came with two bikes to use - we really only used them to circle the resort a few times but we did see people using them during the day to tour wineries and get into town at night for dinner. Resort Grounds Stunning! Perfectly landscaped for the climate. Sunset at Solage is divine. Relax with a glass of wine and soak it in. The whole resort is laid out like a village with pockets of housing and pathways with centred around some truly original sculptures. The resort is also pet friendly and it was fun to see lots of people walking their dogs. Spa The Spa is how we heard about Solage as it was recently voted one of the top Spas in America by Conde Nast Traveller. The Spa is located together with the fitness centre and set out across four pavilions. The main pavilion includes the Spa check in/shop, locker rooms and waiting lounges. Across from this area is the fitness studio and next to that is the pavilion where group classes are held each day. Further across is the bathhouse area which includes a bar for light meals and refreshments, treatment rooms, outdoor gender separate clothing optional areas (features hot spa, cold plunge, steam and deck chairs) and a central pool with more chairs and private cabanas. We both booked in for massage and agreed that they were possible the best we've ever received. Lots of couples were also doing the Mudslide treatment but we already had another mud treatment booked at Indian Springs so didn't partake (next time). I cannot recommend enough that if you are coming to Solage, you book in for a treatment. it's also worth noting that the pool in the bathhouse pavilion is much more relaxed (piped music, quieter crowd) than the main, family pool area located over on the other side of the resort near the restaurant. Fitness Centre Free classes are held every day ranging from high intensity stuff (i.e. Spin) to calmer stuff (i.e. Yoga). The Fitness Centre locker rooms open early in the morning at the same time as the fitness centre (5am) and include a steam room if you can't wait for the bathhouse to open. There is lots of well maintained equipment for cardio, weights and stretching. A really impressive setup. Staff Every staff member that we encountered was courteous and friendly. It's worth mentioning this because everyone, grounds staff to waiters to spa staff always smiled and said hello. A really slick operation with some great management. Dining Our only disappointment was Solbar. We were excited after everything people had been saying and from the look of the menu. Don't get us wrong, the food was amazing but the service really let the whole experience down. Maybe they were having an off night but here's how it unfolded - the greeter seemed to come across as though she has a better place to be. There was zero consistency in service all night - every order taken and every plate bought to the table was by someone different. There was supposed to be a Sommelier but he didn't visit us (shame because the wine list was amazing). I did want to make a special mention of an AMAZING desert that I had though. Stout (yes, Stout!!!) ice-cream with pretzels and burnt caramel sauce. O.M.G. Sounds crazy but it was one of the most perfectly unique things I've ever tasted. In Summary..... It was tough leaving Solage and it certainly a place we will make time to visit again. There are so many wineries around this area that it would be very easy to come for a week, hit the wine trail every morning and lounge at the spa every afternoon.

Room tip: call the property and request a room near the oaks behind the spa (might be a higher category room). These rooms have patios that look over a ravine with oaks that are home to red tailed hawks that we've watched hunt, granted hawks can a bit loud! Also, we find these rooms are more private and lend themselves to walking or riding our cruiser to the main area of the resort.

Sure it's pricey, but as the title line says... Rooms, termed studios, are in the form of chalets/cottages/cabins and most have parking nearby so you don't have to walk far to unload / reload your car. The studios are larger than most hotel rooms and include sitting areas and a patio. The bath amenities are the hotel's own blends, the bath area includes a small dressing area near the vanity/sink, and the shower has a pebble stone floor. The bed is very comfortable with down linens and there's turndown service in the evening. I took a few treatments at the spa including the resort's signature Mudslide...and when it was over, I wanted to do it again....BLISS. The best part was the sound chair; I want one for my living room!!! :-) When you have any spa treatment, you get to use the geothermal mineral pools--a bit like soaking in a bathtub, but very relaxing and if you're lucky, you can retire to the shade of a cabana, which I don't think are reserved, unlike those at the main pool. Meals at Solbar were wonderful--don't be put off by the prices because they're worth it, particularly for dinner. I had short ribs for dinner one night and then short ribs hash for breakfast the next day...they were just THAT good!!!! I didn't have lunch at Solbar because you can order food while lounging around their BEAUTIFUL olympic sized pool. Here's where the prices seem high--$7 for fries and no mixed drink under $10. Still, it's worth it, even though they tack on a 20% service charge, just like room service. KILLER fish tacos, by the way!!!!!!!!! As for the personnel, the staff were all very attentive seemed happy in their jobs, despite spending a lot of time in the hot sun. If there's one detractor, it's that the grounds seem to belie the location. In the rich fertile Napa Valley, the grounds of Solage look very arid and prairie-like; lots of brush with patches of manicured lawns with water features, numerous geckos scurrying across your path, and very little shade. However, some of that brush include lavender plants and honeysuckle bushes and when the breeze carries their scent, you somehow don't mind the lack of greenery. Given the price tag, you might think you'd be surrounded by a bunch of A-list money'd \"beautiful people\", but it's surprisingly not like that. It's very mixed crowd that includes young couples, families, and small groups of friends, most of whom haven't stepped out of the pages of \"Town and Country\" and don't have gym-toned bodies.

I did not regret it as it was perfect for my purposes. At first, the lobby/check in area did not impress me much - for the price, a bit low key. This is just a matter of taste, and I can see the sense in not wasting too much space and capital on the check in area. However, the service and thoughtfulness of the staff was top notch. The hotel rooms are lodge type self contained small houses, on the hotel compound. The rooms were much more impressive, spacious, well maintained with clean modern lines and materials. The design was superb, leaving the feeling that it was modern yet in touch with nature. The front of the lodge had a small patio area where my room looked out on a shared common area with a fountain. Usage of bicycles was complimentary and great fun. The concierge, I believe his name was Santiago, was fantastic. He arranged restaurant bookings, limo service, worked with out itinerary, and was helpful throughout our stay. He introduced us to our limo driver, Said, who was fantastic and knew all the wineries and scenic spots inside out. I also have to mention Sol Bar and the Spa. Sol Bar has great food - you don't always need to head out to have a great meal. We stayed in for some meals and Sol Bar served up good gourmet food with service to match. The spa has won many awards, including for best spa in the US I believe, so if time allows, that should be tried as well. The only minus point for this hotel is that technically, it is not really near any of the wineries, nor is it near the main area of Napa where well known restaurants and shops are clustered. Taxi service in Napa is non-existent, and therefore you will have to rely on limo service (which costs) or car rental (which means you can't drink), so take this into account.

The toilet is separated by a door,but the shower is via a see-through door so that if you were travelling with a friend then you would have to be a pretty good friend and give each other some privacy. The whole thing was very well appointed with great products and the shower area particularly impressed with its pebble shower base. Gym - excellent - amongst the best I have seen in a hotel. About 6 running machines and numerous other cardio offerings. Plenty of free weights and weights machines. I joined a spin class one morning - it was well run though bikes one of the older spin models. I didn't do any pilates or yoga but I am prepared to bet that those classes are top notch. Swimming pool - huge! Lots of sunbeds and very pleasant surroundings. It wasn't really hot enough during my stay so I hung out at the bar (!)

However, the units are spread out, and it's very peaceful in the rooms and their patios. The outdoor hot tub in our suite was a plus. Free (inclusive) wet bar was a special treat, but I don't think this applies to all rooms. Service is generally attentive, rooms are clean, and spa treatments were good to great. However, the bus boy who showed us to our rooms via bicycle, seemed to be going through the motions when describing our room amenities - perhaps because we were returning guests. Our dinner at SolBar during our second visit last year was good, though the menu tries a bit too hard to be eclectic and exotic (pork belly, etc.) - not that we haven't been exposed to various cuisines before. During our latest trip, for lack of ANY traditional offerings at SolBar, we took room service - simple burgers and fries - and it's probably the first time I've had room service fries that were crisp and not soggy upon delivery. The gym is decent sized, with maybe 10 aerobic stations w/ TV's and a good selection of weight stations. There appeared to be an active series of exercise classes as well.

From the moment we booked, until the moment we left they made us feel special, and really couldn't do enough for us. Firstly several weeks before we arrived I was contacted by the concierge, Tyson, who helped me with making personal recommendations and arrangements for wineries and restaurants. And he knew his stuff too, asking about what wines we preferred and what experiences we were looking for; and as a result of this some of the wineries he suggested that I'd never heard of before are now amongst my favourites. Tyson also helped me make a last minute reservation for a local winery (Reverie) whilst my better half had a spa treatment, where I got to tour with the assistant winemaker one on one - which was a great experience. This great service continued when we checked in; when we were given refreshments and made to feel very welcome at reception whilst we registered. To be honest the whole process was so quick that we didn't get to finish them, but that didn't matter. We were quickly taken to our room by one of the check-in staff who cycled ahead of us as we drove through the property to the room itself which was luxurious, well designed and modern - there was even a complementary bottle of Napa Valley Chardonnay and some nibbles waiting for us on our arrival. The beds were tremendously comfortable, and very restful; at night the property was very quiet and we were never disturbed once. We also loved sitting out in the evening on our private patio staring up at the stars with a glass of Napa Valley wine. The night sky there is so amazingly clear (due to the lack of light pollution and altitude I'd guess). Our room rate included breakfast, so we ate at SolBar every morning for 3 days, each time trying something different each (so all in we tried 6 different breakfast options). Each one was freshly prepared, and really good - my personal favourite was the lemon-ricotta pancakes; but everything was of an equally high standard, as of course was the service. We also ate at the bar in the restaurant one night for dinner, trying the 'lucky pig' which was a really unusual and fun meal; and the staff showed us how to play bocce ball afterwards (we'd always wondered, as it's not something we're familiar with this side of the pond). We booked a couples package at the spa, which included a 'mudslide' and a massage. Choosing from the menu of different mud aromas was not something I was expecting beforehand, but it was a really rejuvenating and relaxing experience, which we both thoroughly enjoyed. The spa staff were friendly and professional, and we always felt in good hands (sometimes literally!). We also had use of the geothermal mineral pools included in our rate, which we enjoyed as it was a little closer to our room than the main pool area. That's not to say we didn't use the main pool. because we did; and we liked that they have both an adults pool and an area for families - the poolside service was also faultless. The cruiser bikes are a nice feature. We would use them to get around the property, going to breakfast, the spa or the pool etc, and we even went for a ride a little further afield on them to a few of the neighbouring wineries, and into Calistoga itself which was a lot of fun. We also liked the minted water that housekeeping would leave every night as part of the turndown service. At the end of our stay we were sad to leave, but the great service didn't finish there. After we'd checked out we were getting into our car to leave and the valet approached us and asked us if we needed any bottled water for our onward journey (it was a hot day), and he went off to get us some; which was a nice touch that showed genuine customer care. For us, the service at Solage sets it apart from its' competitors; it's welcoming, and unfussy, and in no way obtrusive or overbearing and we'll go back without a seconds hesitation.", "Date": "August 10, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "walnut creek", "Title": "\u201cRelaxing\u201d", "Author": "BettyWalnutCreek", "ReviewID": "UR74045021", "Content": "The food and service is wonderful!

The rooms are immaculate with a clean, modern design with everything you'd expect at a five star resort. Love the cottage style layout (nobody above or below). The pool...... man o' man! If you're a swimmer, you're gonna love it. 40 meters in length. Unbelievable! Almost double the length of a standard Olympic sized-pool. Not too heavy on the chlorine, either. Lap swimming at it's finest! And they have a separate kiddie pool. So, no screaming kids or leaking diapers in the water. :) Ditto for the gym. Nice facility with quality equipment. And an incentive to work off all the wine and dinners... The spa is beautifully designed. Serene. Did the couples mud slide and it was a trip! Not a standard mud bath at all. Blissed out to the max. Only gripe: had read complaints about the landscaping and thought, someone's being a persnickety ----, but I have to agree. Our patio had no privacy and looked out on to dried-out mulch with minimal, small plantings. I don't think this is a case of waiting for maturing growth. It'll still be sparse. In this verdant valley? Add some plantings to form a hedge around the outdoor spaces (some units have that, but not many). Also, we were there Tues. - Fri., it was definitely not full capacity, and mellow just the way I like it. Wonder what the place would be like if it were totally booked... But, we'll definitely return to find out. Final note: if you arrive late like we did and head into Calistoga expecting to get some dinner, every place will be closed around nine on a Tuesday night. Didn't help that Solage stops room service at nine, as well.

Our room was fantastic - very modern, super comfortable bed, huge pebble-floor shower, iPod dock that played our music on our semi-private patio. And despite the July heat, we did use the bikes to visit two nearby wineries! Small details like the fresh minted water with turn down service were very nice. We also spent a few hours each day at the pool which was relaxing and fun -- it has a bit of a Miami feel to it with entertaining people-watching and great drinks -- but still quiet and relaxing. I spent one morning at the spa -- loved the Mudslide! Highly recommend it. I wish I had realized I would be applying the mud myself (you can ask for help) b/c I would have made my boyfriend come along also for a couples one. After the mud, you soak in a bath of Calistoga mineral water for 20 minutes, then a \"relaxation\" chair for 20 minutes. I could have skipped the chair... In addition to two breakfasts at Solbar (not for those without an appetite!), we had dinner one night at Solbar. The food, the patio, the wine, the service -- everything was excellent.

There are many fantastic wineries (Larkmead, August Briggs, Twomey, Clos Pegase) within a few minutes that are far less crowded and serve great wine.

We took the retro bikes 1/4 mile away and did a hike for an hour up a local peak -- Oat Creek Preserve or something like that. It was wonderful and so close! We ate breakfast both days at Solbar. The food was creative and very yummy. They were more than willing to split our breakfast entrees and our fruit plate was bursting with local berries and all sorts of things. As we drove up we were able to work with Jason, the concierge, to book appointments at local wineries at the last minute. Jason was awesome and guided us to some great tours and got tasting fees waived at some places too. Very nice. Our only glitch was that there's only Jason and he can only work 5 days a week.

If you are interested in their classes call ahead to check the schedule. We booked a wine tour that conflicted with a free pilates reformer class that I would have liked to take.

Before we took this journey we began our research under a general sense of wanting to visit the CA wine country, including Napa and Sonoma. As we dug deeper into hotels, wine tours, and other options, Calistoga became the obvious destination, and the Solage Calistoga Resort was clearly our best choice of hotels. We were looking for accommodations on the higher end of the luxury spectrum, conveniently situated near the wineries we wanted to visit, within walking distance of nearby a town, and potentially a spa. We reviewed and called the following hotels in the area: 1. Heraldsburg Hotel \u2013 http://www.hotelhealdsburg.com/ 2. El Dorado Hotel \u2013 http://www.eldoradosonoma.com/el_dorado_hotel.html/ 3. Solage Calistoga \u2013 http://www.solagecalistoga.com/ 4. Harvest Inn \u2013 http://www.harvestinn.com/ All these properties had unique aspects, such as being in a downtown area, acceptable rates (around $195), and well-reviewed. Nonetheless, most didn\u2019t have the room configuration or availability for the dates we were interested in (apparently, April/May is a popular time for weddings in this part of CA). In the end, Solage was the only hotel that was able to accommodate our needs. The hotel reviewed well on TripAdvisor and other travel sites, but what really impressed me was the reservation process. I spoke with a wonderful reservation specialist, Hallie Spahr (hspahr@solagecalistoga.com), who was incredibly patient while she took care to understand the nature of our trip, identify the exact experience we were looking for, and discuss in great depth the location of the hotel (Northern Napa). Hallie made sure to point out special attributes of Solage such as their Michelin-starred restaurant, and the fact that their spa is rated #1 America and Caribbean and #10 in the World by Conde Nast; it is also rated the #2 Spa Resort and #11 Resort U.S. and Canada by Travel + Leisure Magazine. I was impressed that Hallie wanted to know if we were celebrating anything special and what our arrival time may be, so that she could secure dinner reservations for our first night to ensure we didn\u2019t go hungry on arrival! I was very impressed with her professionalism at the booking, and again later with her correspondence regarding any further questions we had. We flew into San Francisco around 9pm, and the night-time drive to Calistoga took about 2 hours, as there wasn\u2019t much traffic. When we arrived around 11pm, Kevin at the front desk was more than friendly and welcoming, ensuring we felt very well taken care of. Due to our flight delays, we unfortunately missed our dinner reservation; upon seeing our disappointment, Kevin rushed over to the bar to get us a bottle of wine right before it closed. After a long journey, we were enormously grateful to Kevin! Our room was spectacular. We stayed in the Atlas Studio which was absolutely wonderful with breathtaking views of the pool while being very close to the restaurant. The room was immaculate, very well appointed in a modern yet comfortable style, with a definite luxurious feel. We were very happy to rest comfortably in feathery down beds. Some of the best features of our room were: 1. We really liked the eco-friendly approach of refilling Solage glass water bottles instead of supplying daily plastic water bottles. The mint leaves in our water were very refreshing and provided a nice touch. 2. Along the same eco-friendly note, we appreciated the large containers of shower gel, shampoo, and conditioner instead of the traditional small, plastic, single use containers. 3. The bathrobes were simply heavenly!! After traveling around the world and experiencing some very lovely bathrobes, I can easily say these were by far the most luxurious, thick, soft, enveloping bathrobes I\u2019ve ever experienced. Just putting them on and sitting on our patio made us feel restored. 4. Kudos to the housekeeping staff for always keeping our room exceptionally clean and welcoming. Great job! We spent our next 2 days we wine tasting and touring vineyards. I will go into details of those visits in my next column. For now, let me just say we had a great time and enjoyed the opportunity to experience a variety of winemaking styles, grapes, and individuals at each location. Each morning before our wine tasting tours, we had a delicious breakfast at the hotel restaurant. Each server was exceptionally knowledgeable and friendly, but Raul earns my highest praise for his attentiveness to our dining experience. Still, thanks should go to all the restaurant crew for their great job. Solage has a beautiful pool and we chose to sit by it couple of times to enjoy the view while we collected and recounted our memories of the day. We did have a disappointment during one of these visits when we ordered a drink, then were unable to get the waitress\u2019s attention and finally had to settle our bill directly with the bartender. While we certainly felt that flat 20% gratuity added by Solage was unjustified for such exceptionally unreliable service, we chose not to focus on the negative but instead on the continued enjoyment of the trip. Sadly this was not to be, as a few minutes after we returned to the room, we got a call from our waitress asking why we didn\u2019t pay her and why we left the pool without settling the bill! After far too much dialog explaining that due to her lack of attentiveness to her job we had to settle it at the pool bar (along with the fact that her colleagues should have communicated this to her), she eventually released us from the conversation of mistrust and mutual embarrassment. On our final day, we made spa appointments, as we simply had to experience the award-winning spa at Solage. We had 1 body massage and a combination of a facial and a foot massage. The spa facility is very nice, open with beautiful grounds that are separate enough from the main hotel/pool area for some peace and quiet. While the check in process was unusually fast for a spa, we were able to get into the more relaxed mood once in the waiting area. The therapists were wonderful. Both were very calm, kind, and expert in their respective areas. The Calistoga area is known for their mineral water (there is actually a water bottling facility down the road) and the spa offers clothing optional men\u2019s and women\u2019s mineral water, hot and cold pools, and a co-ed pool in the spa area. While smaller than expected, I really liked the mineral water pools. The co-ed spa pool was also very pleasant, and the grounds well envisioned and maintained. The only issue we experienced was when ordering poolside drinks (again!) with a snack. For clarity, the spa pool is only available to spa guests, meaning if you are having a spa treatment you are welcome to enjoy the pool before or after your appointment. Of course, in this case you are in your bathrobe or swimsuit either awaiting or following your spa treatment and generally don\u2019t have any valuables on you, just the locker key where all your belongings remain. As such, I was surprised when we were asked to provide a room number or a credit card in order to place our poolside order. We explained that we had just checked out a couple of hours ago, so no room number was available, but of course all of our credit card information was on file and easily accessible. After much discussion of how to retrieve this information, we were told that we simply must provide a credit card if we wanted to be served. You can imagine how aggravating and disappointing it is to be reduced to a conversation of having to go back to the locker to immediately pay a $30 bill after we just spent over $2,000 on the visit! The pool restaurant attendant explained how there is nothing she can do as \u201cthe system\u201d would not let her enter our order and how this is the process\u2026on, on and on. While I understand systems and processes, this is not acceptable for a hotel that charges $500+ night, nor should it be my problem or concern how Solage systems or processes work. I am a guest, attempting to enjoy the spa pool after my spa treatments, and for the type of luxury establishment Solage attempts to be, I expect the back-office challenges to be solved without my involvement. In light of two disappointing pool experiences, Solage should definitely provide better training to their pool staff and empower them to make decisions that satisfy basic guest expectations of the caliber Solage aspires to be. All in all, other than a few poorly trained pool staff, the hotel was enjoyable. We loved the room, the mineral pools, and the restaurant experience. Still, I\u2019m not sure I would return without some assurance that the few hassles we experienced would not be repeated. This is a growing opportunity for Solage to improve this one aspect of their business, and I certainly welcome any comments from its management as to steps that are being put in place to address this. Once that happens, I would absolutely be comfortable returning and recommending Solage to my faithful readers. http://www.travelupgradeguide.com/calistoga-ca.html", "Date": "May 26, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Fairfield, Connecticut", "Title": "\u201camazing resort\u201d", "Author": "pic182", "ReviewID": "UR64001549", "Content": "My wife and I stayed here for a short getaway at the beginning of May.

We stayed in a Mira studio that included a king bed, fireplace and stone floor shower. The studio was modern in design. There were things that we liked about this resort and things that we didn't like. Things that we liked: - Check-in was efficient and cups of warm chai tea were given to us during the check-in process. - The stone floor shower was beautiful. - The bed was comfortable and had plenty of pillows. - The linens were nice and plush. - The i-pod docking station was nice. - The shampoo and lotions were fabulous. - Solbar was a fabulous restaurant...great breakfast and dinner. -The spa was visually beautiful and I had a great pedicure. Dislikes: -The modern style of the room was a bit cold. I did not like the cement floor it was hard on the feet and the slippers were hidden in the closet (We did not find them until the last day). -We received turn down service.....this included a carafe of water, linens turned down on the bed, fresh towels and an inspirational quote placed on the bed. While all of this was great we would have really appreciated the carafe of water at check-in. For the amount of money you spend some chocolate would have been great at turn down. On our last night we didn't even receive turn down service. We had dinner at the Solbar restaurant and I guess we weren't gone long enough. If the resort was on there A game they would have taken note that we had a dinner reservation and made sure to come during that time. -Use of the mineral pools is available if you are receiving a spa treatment. It would have been nice to have access to the mineral pool if you were simply a guest of the resort. -I received a facial at the spa. When I woke up the next morning my face was beet red and blotchy. I returned to the spa that morning and spoke to a manager and they said sorry and sent me on my way. I called her when I got home and let her know that I was still in great discomfort and only then did she offer to refund my money. I was extremely disappointed. -The resort backs to a trailer park and a low income apartment complex. All in all Solage is a nice place.

I made some new friends at the pool, had the best spa experience of my well traveled life, and enjoyed the grounds, bocce ball, and solitude it my beautiful room.

In one particular instance, concierge had told us we did not need to make reservations for lunch, but we were turned away upon arrival at the restaurant since it was completely fully booked. Rooms: Rooms are a bit dark because of the minimal motif and dark cement floor design. Maid Service: Overall the rooms were tidy and well maid; however, on one day housekeeping disregarded the \"Do Not Disturb\" sign on our door, and entered to clean it while we were having breakfast. We had put the sign on the door because we did not pack up all our belongings before leaving the room that day. Overall: Overall we had a good stay, but for the price, I would probably stay elsewhere next time. I would rather stay in Yountville or St. Helena as well to be closer to the wineries and restaurants as Calistoga is a bit further out. I will, however, definitely make a trip out to the Solage again for the restaurant.", "Date": "September 17, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "London", "Title": "\u201cWine country bliss\u201d", "Author": "GPA7", "ReviewID": "UR39361599", "Content": "Good: 1.

Each cottage has their own little patio with lounge chairs, we spent a lot of time hanging out on the patio overlooking beautiful old oak trees. It felt very private. They have three pools, one is a mineral pool in the bathhouse by the spa, which was my favorite, and then a larger pool and a family pool over by the restaurant. Great workout facility, one of the best I have seen, even though I never actually used it, I liked knowing it was there just in case..... Also had a beautiful yoga studio next to the gym. Food was really amazing at Solbar. Unique very fresh California cuisine, and great atmosphere on outdoor lounge / patio and fire-pit. The restaurant also serves filtered water which I loved and so appreciate. They have cruiser bikes at every cottage, so you can cruise around town or the resort. Love that. They also allow dogs, we brought our two little Chihuahuas and they loved it. So nice to go on vacation and not have to leave them behind! I am a total purist when it comes to bath products, and Solage actually has really pure bath products in the rooms made by Sumbody - a great company. I travel a lot and can not think of a single time when I have ever used the products in hotel rooms because most are full of chemicals and preservatives. I always bring my own. I was so pleasantly surprised and to be honest a little shocked when I saw that they are using \"Sumbody\" products in the rooms and they really are actually all natural and pure. I am so impressed by the \"little things\" and Solage doesn't' miss a beat on those great little extravagant details. The spa also has an organic all natural line of facial products called Eminence, my absolute favorite skin care line ever. I usually don't get facials at resorts because most have products that are full of chemicals. Solage is definitely the most eco-frinedly resort I have been too. They have countless green aspects, one of my favorites was that instead of bringing plastic bottles of water to your room at night, they leave you a complimentary beautiful reusable glass bottle of filtered water with a beautiful sprig of mint in it for turn down service. Great touch, and I highly commend them for doing away with the plastic bottles, what a great idea. First resort I have stayed at that does this. That alone makes me want to go back. Had two fabulous massages while I was there at the spa and we also did the couples mud slide experience, which I highly recommend. Pure heaven. Just writing about it makes me want to go back.

Our room/Cabin was fantastic - the bed was great; the bathroom was luxurious. The rooms are tastefully decorated. The restaurant - Solbar- located at the resort was excellent; in fact it was so good that we ate there two out of three nights during our stay, thereby allowing both my wife and I the indulgence of sharing a bottle of wine and not having to drive (the third night we ate at the excellent restaurant 'Cooks' in St. Helena). The food was incredibly fresh and tasty. We also had a great waiter named Moss who was super friendly and made our dining experience special. The gym equipment was all top-notch and, at least when I was there, underutilized by the other guests; I was normally the only person in the gym. The resort offers about three physical fitness activties a day (swimming, pilates, etc). My wife and I took a spinning class as well as a yoga class. Both instructers were very good.

I now work at a company that travels a lot, and I'm lucky to stay in lovely hotels all over the world with my crew. Please don't misunderstand: these things don't make me spoiled, but well-versed. A group of 12 of us recently stayed at the hotel during a work trip. We work hard and the thought of having a nice comfortable place to stay at night was something to look forward to. we heard good things, and the property was lovely upon sight. Not at all what I expected, as it was so new and suburban feeling, almost a bit like something out of the The Truman Show, but its new, so excusable. The rooms are huge. A lot bigger than I needed. Our group of 12 was staying one week, so I didn't feel bad calling to ask if I could switch to a room with one bed vs. two, since I was alone here for 7 days, but they said they couldn't work it out so I shrugged and didn't make a thing of it. (although I found this strange because it was a Monday and the hotel seemed kind of empty). The next night, a work friend called the hotel restaurant, Bar Sol, to make a reservation for 12. She called at 5:30 for a 7:30 dinner reservation. The hostess laughed in her face, which I found unnecessary and rude. However, we are a reasonable group and I suppose it was kind of last minute, so when she told us there is no way she could fit us in, we made no deal of it and decided to meet for cocktails at the bar/restaurant first and then go into town for dinner. At this point, the group had now narrowed to 8. While we were at SolBar having cocktails, 7:30 rolled around and we realized the place was quite empty. There were over 10 tables open outside and an entire indoor eating area inside with not ONE table occupied. We asked the hostess if she could fit our group afterall, and she said she'd \"work on it\". (?) Even the bartender questioned what was taking so long in getting her to seat us, as he was getting slammed at the bar due to their lack of effort in finding us a proper table. About an hour and an order of appetizers in an empty restaurant later, they finally sat us down. We waited for an HOUR AND A HALF before they even brought us BREAD. two hours later, we were served food that wasn't worth the wait (maybe we were just fuming). We asked the waiter what the deal was and he answered uncomfortably, \"i'm not supposed to talk about why we can't seat people here. its a weird thing that doesn't make sense\" (!) We stopped prying and his manager/the hostess lady pulled him aside and we never saw him again! they had another person tend to us the rest of the meal. It was really strange and felt more like The Truman Show by the minute. Like a cult or something. The next awful event was the spa. It happened to be my birthday during my stay, and my boss generously booked me a massage our last night at the hotel. He made a 6pm reservation. I showed up at 5:30 and the girl told me to go wait in the mineral pool. It was 99 degrees outside, and I was in a robe, and the pool was pretty hot too, so I opted to sit outside the mineral pool under an oning and wait for the masseuse. 6:10 rolls around and I thought I misunderstood, so I went back to the front desk to see where she was.The girl then rudely told me that I was in the wrong area and that I was supposed to have come back inside (wrong. she did NOT tell me that. she told me the masseuse was supposed to come find me, which is the norm in spas. besides, i had not moved from where she told me to go originally). She then told me to go wait in the waiting area, which was cute, but outside. Again, I had on a robe and it was 99 degrees outside. I'm pouring sweat, and getting cranky. Its 6:30 something. I go inside to the air conditioned area in the front reception and told her I'd wait there. After a lot of squirming around up at the front desk, the manager then comes to report that they've made a mistake and can't fit me in. (I'm sure you readers must thing I either: stink, am funny looking or am some sort of whacked out maniac at this point in the story considering all of these people keep denying me service. But alas, none of this is true, i can assure you). She was trying very hard to be sugary nice and fix the problem by offering things like, \"we have a male masseuse that can give you a foot rub\" (I specifically wanted a female masseuse and told them this earlier in the day after my boss booked the appointment for me and told her I would not take a male in replacement of my original request, so she tried to push this weird situation about a foot massage on me). she offered to let me take a dip in their mineral pool (uh, that comes free with the service, you ain't fooling me here) and then finally, when I explained to her I had knots in my back I was looking forward to getting worked on with a proper massage and a dip in the pool wouldn't cut it as a replacement, she insisted I go to a room with this specialty NASA-built-state of the art chair which was a great massage chair and really relaxing. At this point, I\"m utterly annoyed and said no thank you, but she insisted I go sit in the chair while she tried to work out my appointment. I said okay and was lead to a room with what is basically a luxury lazy-boy. it doesn't move, you lounge in it and put on earphones while they play bad hippie jazz in your earphones. I'll admit, I was in a really bad mood at this point, so maybe to some this could be relaxing, but after 2 minutes, I turned the stupid thing off, went to the bathroom, got dressed and left. I told them to call me in my room if they could fit me in soon. She chased me out the door saying they could get me in in 30 minutes. I gave in and said okay, but that I needed to call my friends, seeing as I had dinner reservations soon and I had to check to see if we could push them back. It turns out our dinner plans could not be rearranged, so I called her to express my disappointment in this situation and even added that we had a similarly bad experience at the restaurant a couple of nights before. She said I'm sorry and didn't offer any complimentary treatment on a future visit or anything in leu of . She did, however, send a candle and an apology to my room, but after all that craziness, it didn't make up for it. Although her effort was appreciated, her ideas of things (foot massage, free pool usage, weird dumb space chair, candle) as replacements for the hour massage I got screwed on, were stupid. Later, to just get the day over with, I ordered room service. The delivery girl walked right into my room upon delivering my food,even though I took the platter from her hands and insisted she didn't have to help me set it up, attempted to be chatty cathy about what was on my tv, and then later, around 10pm, might i add, came banging on my door asking for the dishes back.Literally, BANGING and yelling into my door. I was asleep. Overall, this place is so utterly pretentious. They built this huge commune, filled it with fancy rooms, a spa and a restaurant but obviously don't have the man power or knowledge of how to train their staff to be service-oriented. Nobody there asks what YOU want, how they can help YOU, but instead, treat you like you should be lucky to be there. I don't buy it. You don't build clientle by trying to trick people into thinking they are part of something good, or part of some \"scene\" they are trying to create, but instead, you built clientle by offering good, professional service, by working with a customer and their needs, and by stepping off your high horse. They lost a group of potentially 40 something people, for weeks at a time, every few months. THATS how bad the service was. My entire crew was talking about how bad this experience was. And even best! I didn't pay for anything! My work paid for everything and I am still just mad. I cannot IMAGINE how livid I would be if this were my own money, saved up for a vacation. Absolutely not worth it. This place needs to take some of the money they put into the extra, weird space in the room and replace it with some service training around here.

It's almost there, but not quite. I'm reluctant to be at all negative because I had such a relaxing and enjoyable time. When you visit I think you'll see what I mean. Unlike some five star resorts this property -- perhaps because of the informality of California and the surrounding rustic ranch-like country -- is quite relaxing from the moment you drive up. It doesn't take time to unwind. I guess that someone would say the karma is good at this place. There is this wonderful setting and the quiet of the Silverado Trail backcountry. At any rate the location is superb. The main dining room has one of the most beautiful views of the mountains through a huge, two or three story window. Outdoor dining with a fire on top of a rectangular fountain is superb.

I rated the place \"above average\" because there are some outstanding features of this hotel/spa but there are some negative features as well which makes it hard for us to decide whether we would go there again, especially given how expensive the place is. I didn't have time to read the reviews on tripadvisor (which I normally do) before our trip and I wish I had because they are quite accurate. I only had their website to go by and when we got there, we were really disappointed because the entire place looked a lot \"cheaper\" than what we were imagining from their brochure and website. The place is very new and the trees and shrubbery they had planted are still very young so the entire place looks very bare. The entire bareness highlights the cheap construction of the \"bungalows\" where visitors stay and it is too reminiscent of \"summer camp\" from our childhood days. With the prices were paying, we were looking for more than \"summer camp.\" We had the most expensive unit in this hotel - a suite. Unfortunately, our suite looked onto the trailer/motor home camp which we could see easily because they didn't bother to have some tall shrubs covering this unpleasant view. We were a little disappointed that we had paid $800 a night to have an experience of staying in a summer camping ground. If you are allergic to bug bites (as we are), make sure you bring bugspray...I don't think they spray the premises (since they are very green) so we got bitten by a variety of bugs while walking around the hotel grounds. To be fair to the hotel, the inside of the suite was very nice (if you like the modern/contemporary \"West Elm\" look). Our bathroom was very large and we liked the fact that we each had a bathroom sink (thus we never had to fight for the bathroom mirror). Also, the toilet had a separate door which was nice. The tub was large and our suite had a separate shower which was very spacious. The cement floors were also nice on out bare feet, especially when it was 100F outside...though I can imagine they may be a little cold for winter visitors. We also had our own patio with a dining table, chairs and a hot tub..this patio area was walled off so we had complete privacy when we were outside and enjoying the hot tub. The suite may be worth it for couples and honeymooners who are looking for a romantic getaway. The view of the stars while relaxing in the hot tub at night was quite incredible. Other pros - the restaurant bar has excellent food... everything we ordered on the menu was delicious...hotel staff members are friendly, unpretentious and helpful.

Everyone gets their own little cottage - ours comprised of a large bedroom/livingroom with two double beds and a very large shower room. The whole resort has a very contemporary feel to it. Outside your cottage you each get a nice seating area and a couple of bikes - it took me a while to get on mine but they're great fun and really safe. It's the only place in America where I've seen cycle lanes so worth getting out and about. The pool is amazing - a proper sports pool where you could do length after length and loads of loungers/umbrellas. The staff are really attentive and come round all the time with water/drinks etc. The restaurant/bar is set near the pool with a large comfy area to sit outside - most people take breakfast here. My only complaint would be how limited the menus were and they didn't change all week. The staff were very helpful (though sometimes overwhelmed at breakfast). The concierge was great at making bookings at the vineyards and reastaurants for us. The spa looks great but I found the choices fairly boring and I wasn't that impressed with my facial (this was part of a treatment which included a wrap and massage - had to move from the facial room to the massage room which was a bit of pain) and my mini pedicure was poor. OK but I've had better. The gym was well equipped and light and airy which was nice but pretty crammed. Eg if you like doing floor work wasn't much room cos of all the machines. They have a studio and I got to try the pilates machines but they only had 2/3 classes over the whole week. The resort is about a 10 minute walk from Calistoga which is a cute old town with a few nice shops and restaurants - but don't expect much night life. We pretty much went to out to other places in the evening as the area has so many great restaurants on offer.

We are blessed to have travelled extensively and have stayed in numerous \"luxury\" hotels (including several Auberge Group hotels).

Why did the restaurant \"run out\" of black tea on a weekend? Why couldn't someone from the hotel quickly run to Cala Food in Calistoga and purchase a box of Lipton for the enjoyment of guests who wanted a cup of tea for breakfast on a Sunday morning (desperate measures for desperate times). 3. Why was our salt grinder filled with pepper in the restaurant? I could go on, but I think the above is illustrative of the issues that plague this hotel. Yes, its the little things that keep guests coming back. We own property in Calistoga and welcome with open arms a \"luxury\" hotel, but reputations and return guests must be earned. Solage Calistoga continues to provide \"uneven\" service even 1 year after its opening. This is a shame as much of the staff provide good-excellent service, but the careless or poorly trained staff are ruining it for everyone else. I can hear Solage's management defending themselves now by complaining about the unavailability of good staff. That dog won't hunt as your competitors are not plagued by the same level of poor service.

The two turndown services are a nice compliment but certainly do not merit the overpriced studio rates. The spa is nice and I would recommend it, though to swim in the warm pool within the spa, one has to either have a treatment done that day or pay $25.

The pebble shower was fantastic, and the sink/bathroom areas were simple and clean. Bed was comfy, breakfast at their restaurant was good, and the staff was friendly. Had a couples mud bath at their spa, which basically involved spreading mud on each other and baking in a room for 20 minutes, followed by a soak in a mineral bath and 20 minutes in a vibrating chair with headphones and relaxing music. Mud baking was just ok, but I enjoyed the soak and the chair. When I return, I'll opt for a bigger unit next time, mostly because of the fact the bed sits several feet from both the main door and the sliding glass door.

Shortly before the trip, a staff member contacted us, and talked up the grounds -- explaining how wonderful they were, and how we wouldn't ever leave the property once we got there. The hotel's photos seemed to show a nicely-landscaped lux property. When we arrived, however, the property looked like a sad army barracks in the dust bowl. Almost none of the landscaping was in, construction was on-going, and it seemed like a full third of the rooms faced the parking lots. That said, the room was nicely decorated, but the rooms' windows and outdoor patios really are on top of one another - all facing each other across a square. No privacy at all. Because of that, the outdoor patio really isn't useful, and the rooms themselves are fairly small. We decided to leave. You can find much much nicer places to stay in Napa or Sonoma even at $450 per night. The initial clerk at the reception was fairly snotty about it -- and for this I nearly took his head off. The manager was very nice about refunding the room rate. I do think the property has the potential to be nice if they put in some bushes or something to give the rooms some privacy.

We chose Calistoga BECAUSE of the fact that it was a fresh new resort with a unique style and green attitude. We were not disappointed! If you are one to avoid dusty floral bed and breakfasts with lace doilies and antique dolls, this would be your place! We LOVED the unique conceptual architecture and the design of the rooms and buildings as well as the resort itself. It must just be a matter of taste. We really enjoyed the serene-dessert-like surroundings as well as the use of the sanded concrete for the floors, low dividing wall to bathroom, etc. The place was impeccably clean, the beds were very soft and the bikes were great. Honestly, it seems that all of the complaints on here relate to either people not liking the style of the resort or the newness of it. The staff is young, but they were very friendly and helpful. The plants need to mature (I guess) but we thought that they actually added to the sparse spa-like atmosphere. In fact, the plants around the mineral pools and bathhouse were completely finished growing, including lemon trees! We are incredibly picky about food since we live in a major food city. Solbar was strong...we ate there for dinner one night, breakfast and then room service. The food was fresh, the portions were appropriately sized and the wine list was nice. Honestly, we were not expecting much as we do not typically expect hotel food to be some kind of five star dining experience. Thus, we were happy with our choices and enjoyed our meals. Ultimately, I would recommend this to travelers who have a hip and progressive aesthetic and those who appreciate a forward thinking hotel that places an importance on sustainable tourism. I would also strongly recommend the spa/bath house and the movement studio. The resort is in a great location and the price is certainly right especially when considering the other options in the area. Enjoy Solage now before it becomes as popular as Calistoga Ranch or L'Auberge. I am absolutely certain that when these kinks (immature landscaping, I guess...) that everyone speaks of are ironed out, Solage will be a much-appreciated respite for those seeking a comfortable and relaxing respite in Napa.

The only nice thing is the pool - which we did not use because it was raining, and the staff was very friendly and helpful. Also, when we were there they were having an opening party for 500 people and did not let us know ahead of time - people were walking in front of our room for 4 hours!

We (my sisters and mom) were there just one night and two days and I really appreciated that. Unlike the other Napa resorts, Solage was willing to do a one night booking. (I'm guessing that will change as soon as the place takes off.) I see that others rated the hotel negatively due to the fact that the landscaping hasn't grown in and construction is not completely finished. It took me awhile to figure out, but I think the whole point behind Solage (Sol as in \"sun\"-get it?) is to be sort of a pro-environment resort. Each room comes with 2 adorable bicycles so that instead of driving into town, you just take a 10 minute bike ride. There are solar panels on the main building; the showers have open doors and stone floors; and the landscape is sort of desert-like. Olive trees and grasses, etc. I really liked it, but if you don't appreciate that look, the place will not be for you. I happened to really like it. The rooms are beautifully decorated and the bathroom and products were great. But the thing that sets the resort apart is the service. I felt like there were about 3 employees per guest. When I asked about the gym, the guy working at the pool escorted me to the beautiful gym and introduced me to the lovely man who was running it. Lunch at the pool was served quickly and we are asked frequently if there was anything else we needed. The guys at the pool bar brought my mother a bunch of magazines without being asked when it became clear that she had no intention of putting on her bathing suit that she last wore when the Beatles were in town. We were each given complimentary massages by the pool (I guess to make up for the fact that the spa hadn't opened, but we had been warned about that so I wasn't expecting anything.) Overall a great experience and I can't wait to go back with my husband!", "Date": "August 9, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "4", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "new york, ny", "Title": "\u201cA new Napa hot spot!!\u201d", "Author": "travelinalways", "ReviewID": "UR8374861", "Content": "Wow...we were really happy with this new resort in Napa. We finally got away for four nights in the wine country. As much as this place is still working on some of the exterior landscaping and such, the restaurant, the pools, the rooms---were all fabulous! \"Solbar\"--their restaurant has delish food...something for everyone (and I'm really picky.) We thought it was a nice change from all of the fancy options in Napa. The chef has a pretty impressive resume, which is what drove us to check this place out. The staff is young, but were eager to please and it's obvious that they were working hard to take care of us. We stayed in a \"Vega\"room--sleek, but comfy- kind of reminded us of a W. We took our bikes that came with our room and rode into Calistoga (5 minutes away) We found the town to be welcoming and pretty laid back. We tried to book spa appointments, but their spa opens later this month. They were entirely apologetic about it not being open. We had massages in our room and still felt like royalty.

The hotel was wonderful and they treated us like we were royalty. The staff was continuously coming up to us and asking what we needed and wanted to make sure we had everything. When we first drove in to the hotel the landscaping was a little barren due to the fact that the hotel was new. But at night, with the lights and the fountains on, it really made the resort look beautiful. Our experience started off perfect from checking in and being greeted by a very hospitable staff, to getting wine left in our room with an itinerary from Linda the concierge of what to do in the area, and free coupons to local wineries. Von Strasser was my favorite. We loved the personal tour Jordan gave us and the wines were spectacular. I think the location was great. We love the town of Calistoga. We felt the hotel provided many services and products complimentary that other hotels and resorts charge. For example, free bottled water in the room, and Yoga and Pilates lessons. The gym was first class with brand new equipment. The restaurant, Solbar, was outrageous. We sat outside, surrounded by artwork, a fountain with fire coming out from the middle, and a fireplace made of metal pipes intertwined to resemble grape vines. The chef Brandon Sharp, formally from The French Laundry, prepared wonderful courses that looked beautiful and tasted wonderful. The pricing was moderate. We had crispy crust Pertrale Sole with Lemon Garlic Risotto and Broccoli Rabe, Riverdog Farms Tomato Salad with Goat Cheese Bocconcini and Fino Verde Basil. The short Ribs were wonderful. All the pastry and breads and muffins were home made. Even the continental breakfast was wonderful serving berries, muffins and wonderful coffee. Everything was first class. As I sat by the pool the group sales manager, Sarah Rector and Don Catalano, from another department, came by to make sure we were happy. The only thing that was missing was that the spa was not open yet. It is expected to be open by the end of August.

We LOVED Solage!!! There is nothing like it in Napa. The staff really cared about our experience and have been very attentive. The scene is amazing we felt like we were in South Beach or Scottsdale. The rooms are so refreshing and spacious. The gym and yoga studio were the best of any resort we have experienced. The restaurant/food was fantastic. They provide bicycles outside every room we have had a blast . The main areas of the property are beautiful. Yes the outer edges of the property still need some landscaping but we were told that when we called for reservations.

I couldn't find a concierge and when I asked for a dinner reservation at the front desk, the clerk handed the phone to me-this is not acceptable.

Why all the bad press? From the reviews I've read up to this point I was nervous to keep my reservation. But I am so pleased with what I found when I got here that I am writing this review while still at the property. Let me start by saying, I am a seasoned traveler and have stayed at other Auberge properties such as Auberge du Soleil and Calistoga Ranch, so I know the caliber people are expecting. But this property isn't advertising itself as an ultra deluxe experience. They are offering you quality, innovation and contemporary and that's what you'll get if you come here. I arrived at the property today and was enthusiastically greeted by a bellman. He walked me into the small reception area, where again I was warmly greeted and immediately offered a cold glass of strawberry lemonade (which was delicious, by the way). I was promptly checked in and handed over to the bellman to guide me to my room. While I was in the reception area, the bellman had lowered the windows of my car to keep it from overheating as it was quite warm this afternoon. He got on his cruiser bike (which I think is fun!) and rode ahead of me and directed me into a parking place adjacent to my room. Yes, the perimeter of the property is not more than dirt mounds, but the interior areas of the property are beautifully planted with specimen olive trees, lavender and other plantings that will be gorgeous as they mature (not to mention sweet smelling). The fountain in the courtyards weren\u2019t running, but when they do turn them on, it will be a very peaceful addition to the outside living rooms. I was brought into my very stylish studio, shown around, asked if I needed anything, and then was left to settle in. The whole property is wi-fi accessed, the flatscreen tv is IPod capable and there is a DVD player (though the property has no DVDs to loan at this time). I sat out on my patio for a while. It was very peaceful and quiet. As I was up here to work on a writing project, I collected my laptop and went to the pool. Folks.the pool area is completely impressive! The pool is 3 feet shy of Olympic size. There are gorgeous chaise lounges, tables, a shaded bar area and a separate children\u2019s pool are with toys. There are tubs filled with ice and water bottles for the taking, and thick towels beautifully stacked at the entrance. And to top it off, there are wonderful cabanas with couches, chairs and tables. There was even a power strip in the cabana for me to plug my laptop into. I was visited no fewer than 3 times by Ashley (the pool girl) to refill my lemonade glass, bring me glass of ice for my bottled water, another chilled bottle of water later on and get this....an electric fan to cool down the cabana while I worked! This is a disappointing property to some of you??? I don't get it. Later as the sun was setting, one of the bellmen was walking around the pool area checking on guests to see if they needed anything. He secured the flap of my cabana which kept blowing back causing the setting sun to stream into the cabana and onto my computer screen. Almost done here. I\u2019ve got to mention the restaurant, SolBar. My husband and I had dinner at the restaurant on property and it was seriously delicious! The decor is amazing. It's hard to decide whether to eat inside or out. There is a fireplace inside that is like artwork, and the fireplace outside is surrounded by water...beautiful. The hostess was very accommodating; we started out by sitting outside, but we got chilly and she happily moved us inside. We shared the sliders and pork buns for starters and I tried one of their new specialty drinks with fresh fruit which was very refreshing. Our entrees were also very delicious. I had the sole and my husband had the short ribs. Oh, and the buns and corn muffins in the bread basket are melt in your mouth delicious. I know, I'm waxing on about this place, but I think Solage Calistoga deserves a big, giant thumbs up to counteract the sour grapes reviews that have mostly been written to date. While there is still some construction being done (too bad the spa isn't open) the fitness room and the movement studio are state of the art. They offer Pilates, boot camp and spinning classes daily. Oh, and did I mention the pair of cruiser bikes parked outside the door (with a pair of bike helmets in the closet of the room)? My only complaint? My \"Sol guide\" never followed through with our phone exchanges about arranging a massage for me. Apparently, roles were reassigned and whoever was to follow up with me didn't. Not the end of the world. Would I come back? Absolutely. This place will go the way of other Auberge properties. When Calistoga Ranch opened a few years back my husband and I were some of the first to visit. The staff was far more disorganized and confused than some people have commented on about those at this property...and look what people are saying about Calistoga Ranch now. If you want an established property, stay at one. If you want to be some of the first folks to try something new and different, get on the phone! They are offering a special price right now M-TH for a studio so make sure you ask for that promotion when you call. I think the offer is good through September....breakfast included.

First let me say what I liked. The staff was very friendly, helpful and tried their best to accomodate whatever we asked for and we really appreciate that. The downside was that we asked for a quiet room and got put in the second to most expensive room away from all the others only to be woken up at 8 am to several bulldozers about 50 ft. from our room during the first morning. Plus, the landscaping and much of the facililty was not completed. We had two plants in the black planters from the landscaping company still sitting in their pots on top of dirt outside our room. Fortunately they had another room away from contruction they were able to get us into easily. That we appreciate. Oh, the pool was lovely and the food tasty at the restaurant, though our server was not very good. Friendly, but not very sharp. Very disappointing that the spa was not open but ended up having a nice treatment at Auberge du Soleil instead. The only difference between the first room we had(second most expensive) and the next (least expensive) was that the first room had a soaking tub and wood burning stove. Same square footage and they were not very big at all. I know they are going for a modern, \"green\" feel, but the rooms are cold and lifeless. After finishing a lovely dinner in town one night, my husband said, \"I guess we have to go back to our cell block now.\" And that's pretty much how I would describe the rooms. They actually have a good base, but need to have some warmth added to the decor. It's just not quite there yet. So, for what they plan to charge after the initial rate I think this hotel will be way overpriced.
