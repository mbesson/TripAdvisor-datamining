Unfortunately the church across the road decided to ring their bell (which sounded like a horrible gong as opposed to a nice bell) at 6am, then 7am, then 8am and finally we got out of bed. Not sure why, it was a Friday morning. That was a deal breaker for us. Also the sink leaked water onto the floor, but if not for the bell we would have just asked for another room-- instead we checked out. All the staff were exceptionally friendly, even when we had language problems, which often makes people irritable, they stayed genuinely friendly.", "Date": "March 9, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Jacksonville, IL", "Title": "\u201cNice Little Hotel Close to 5th Ave\u201d", "Author": "moodymolly", "ReviewID": "UR124568126", "Content": "We stayed at this nice, clean little hotel while on our way to Cancun to pick up visitors from the states as we winter in Mahahual (4 hours south.). It was very clean, the proprietor was very accommodating and the prices were right, 750 pesos. Parking was on the street but close and the owner helped us park so that we would not get a ticket. BUT the best thing about this hotel was - I left my precious iPad there the morning that we left and didn't notice it til we arrived home in Mahahual the next night later. I didn't have any hope in getting it back but we got the hotel number and called and lo and behold - it had been turned in, the owner saved it for us in the safe, and returned it to us a week later when we returned our visitors to the airport. NOW THAT IS AMAZING! I don't know whether that would have happened in the states. Of all the negative publicity that Mexico is getting right now, I want to tell people what the normal people are like down there. They are happy, honest, and very, very, accommodating. We drove from Brownsville to Mahahual for the last four years and have thoroughly enjoyed every minute and have only met wonderful people. I know they are out there but I would lots rather travel in Mexico than the states for the attitude of the people.", "Date": "February 14, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Vancouver, Canada", "Title": "\u201cgreat people\u201d", "Author": "russettjb", "ReviewID": "UR120684875", "Content": "we stayed here in May 2011 to attend a wedding.

We arrived at some ridiculous hour after midnight and the night-guard was very kind to let us in without much fuss (no reservation!). The Ado station (the second one in Playa) is very near, only two blocks away. The room we stayed in was everything you would expect from a higher level accommodation; it was sleek and modern, very clean, comfortable, fans, AC and TV, hot shower, towels and soaps etc. The place is very quiet and very secure, and even has a nice view of its namesake - the church across the road.
