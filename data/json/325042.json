Then our nightmare began, sir/madam I'm sorry but this is not your hotel, the driver has made a mistake.They rang the hotel we should have been in, and gave the taxi driver directions, as nobody knew where it was.Two hours after leaving the airport, we arrived, OH MY GOD, we cant be staying here. talk about a anti climax.!We were asked to pay 22 USD, taxi fare, we had had it by then, jet lagged, desperate for a bath.we had to repeat that our transfer, was paid. but in the end had to pay.Then security took the two large bags. while we carried the other luggage, what seemed a long way, up 3 flights of stairs, (husband suffer,s bad back, and me a grandmother) .Room OK, looked out of widow, and heart sank, this could not be where we were going to spend our precious Christmas  new year, we felt sick.went for a shower, fitment facing wrong way, so had to hold. it, ran water COLD.It was so noisy, all we could do was, go to the apology of a bar, WE COULD NOT COPE, so i immediately went to reception, and greeted with a cold stare from reception, i asked to see manager, I explained everything, and broke down crying, saying we cant possibly stay here, he apologised ,and upgraded our armbands to another part of the hotel, 10 times better, i would say 2*, i asked him if we could move to this side, but he said it was more money, but we paid for 4*i replied, he replied that it was full, and was booked until feb, and no amount of money could change the fact. We decided to wait to see our rep. The next day we turned up v.i.p rep, on holiday. Day after he arrived, yes i think we can help, he made phone call,s then replied, 255 USD per person per night. no way, equivalent to \u62e24000 approx. next day again'I pleaded, please move us, the receptionist replied, i think we can help you, come back tomorrow, this went on for 6 day,s, all Christmas. crying in reception. with 20 other people, near mutiny..Things got worse, no beach towels for 3 days' cold showers, sewerage. stagnent water mossies, flies, rudeness, no filter in pool, leaving gaping hole so children could trap their feet.' no entertainment.drug dealing, prostitutes, people trashing their room, high on drugs, you name it, it was all there, except for what, we expected, A fantastic Christmas/new year holiday of a lifetime.

So let me say firsthand that I am not a snobby traveler as I have slept in a rental car before. That was a better experience!Since our flight was overbooked the day of our departure we needed accomodations for just one more night in the DR. So I booked this thru Hotwire for one night, thinking Great! We get another night added to our vacation! I was wrong.Upon arrival and showing our printed itinerary for stay, the receptionist looked completly confused and dubiously eyeballed us while she called her manager to confirm us. After about 15 min. wait we had our key, pool towel cards, and the remote in hand for our room. The room was on the ground floor, small, and I quickly removed the bedspread to search for bedbugs, given the surroundings.(The bedspread stayed in the dresser I did not put it back on the bed, it looked pretty gross.)The A/C barely worked in the room but the bathroom was recently renovated with marble so that was nice. It was unclear to us if our room was really secure with the outdated locking in the unit.When we decided that we could not stay in the room another minute, we went of course to the bar and ordered 2 beer. At the previous all inclusive, they didnt give us 3 ounce cups for a drink but here they do to conserve. This is not your place if you want a drink. We went to the beach and had a nice swim in MOTOR OIL which was apparantly leaking from the tour boats anchored a few yards off the beach. (I took 3 showers.)By the way there looks like a really nice resort close to the alisios the guard called the Barcelo. It looked a lot better from the beach than the alisios but we did not have time to really ask about it as we got to the beach around 6 PM. The food: poor poor poor. Luckily we had a big lunch prior to leaving our previous all inclusive.All in all, unless you are on a tight budget, please consider staying somewhere else!

The red band has access to all 3 for dinner only)In Bavaro, Punta Cana, you get what you pay for. Alisios is cheap and the quality and level of service is not quite there. However, the staff are friendly and nice, they're willing to help but only when you ask and ask.My husband and I spent 2 weeks there and really enjoyed ourselves, all the basics are there, you do not feel the need for much more. However, if you want to pamper yourself... PAY MORE!When we arrived, the room on offer was terrible! we paid an extra $10 per night to upgrade and got a decent one. AirCon was a God sent. But you have to pay $15 p/week to use the safe in the room. The towels provided (bathroom/ beach towels) are only changed 3 times a week so check exactly which days or you could miss out!I wouldn't recommend this hotel to friends, even though we enjoyed ourselves there, but the surrounding hotels were so much nicer and offered more. Plus the fact that the water and electricity was cut twice in our holiday duration doesn't bode well for it!Punta Cana is very beautiful and really caters for both relaxation and activity holidays so there's lots to do and the hotels that offer the most activities (from water sports to massages) as part of the All-Inclusive are a better bet for a good holiday!It's worth it!

Booked with itravel2000 for me and my 3 girlfriends during Spring Break (no choice, one of us is a teacher). Paid $1,134 CDN each for 1week. In my opinion, this is way too much for what you get. I'd pay 700 bucks tops to stay at this hotel. Thank goodness I'd read the reviews on TripAdvisor and so I knew what to expect because I'd be pretty upset, as were many of my fellow guests. The other reviews are pretty bang-on: no hot water in the showers; doors, tv, safes, air-conditionners which didn't work; bland food  drinks; constant noise from construction and a damn rooster that starts crowing at 4:30 in the morning; ONE single bar which shuts down at 11pm; entrance to the beach closes at 9:30, past then you have to circumvent the garbage dump to get back in. Did I mention the dead rat by the pool, which I reported and was still there 2 days later? It would all be so upsetting if it weren't so comical! Welcome to the ghetto!The upside to it all is that the staff is really quite nice, once you get passed the seductive looks and flirting of the male staff. Since the hotel is so small (and everyone is ready to share in their plight) it feels very homey and communal. The Dominicans in general are lovely, beautiful people who smile and say Hola at every turn. I don't think I would really have gotten a feel for the Dominican hospitality had we stayed in one of the bigger resorts. Speaking of which, thank goodness the big hotel next door had bracelets of the same colour because we ended up crashing there to use their big lovely pool, drink their strong drinks and eat at their amazing buffet.

The walkway outside the room had broken glass and a dead rat on it and when we met another English- speaking guest (which was difficult since everyone only spoke French- INCLUDING the reception desk) we were told that she had mentioned the dead animal days before and that no one had done anything about it. The air conditioning was broken and when we tried to explain that to the desk, they sent a 15 year- old employee who toyed with the remote for 20 minutes- muttered something in French- and then left. There are no screens in the windows and the locks and door handles of all the doors and windows were either broken or missing. The shower was utterly disgusting and obviously just spewed salt water. The rooms were dark and depressing and smelly. There was no soap or shampoo in the bathroom- even though it had been changed over for new guests. Fresh towels are only delivered every other day and several of the light bulbs were burned out.Outside the room was the morning buffet area which (for breakfast) consisted of 5 pieces of some dried out, greasy- fatty cold cuts, some brown and sweaty cheese slices and old fruit covered in flies. The rest rooms are right outside of the buffet area, so it appears that human sewerage is for dessert. The wretched grounds have all manner of construction going on around you (both day and night) and there is a stage where the staff supposedly performs on rotted plywood flooring. I assumed that in this setting that all they could do is re- enact plays about WWII; since the buildings around you have no doors or windows and look like post- war Germany with this bombed- out buildings backdrop. Because of all this construction, there was constant jack- hammering and banging accented only by a (seemingly) blind rooster who crowed both night and day and whose scrill screams only mirrored my own horror at this facility.We thought that perhaps a drink would make things better so we went to the bar and asked for a beer only to have some disgrunted matron unscrew a bottle of beer and pour it into 2 mini- plastic cups and then go back to her job- being both incredibly bored and overwhelmingly irritated at the guests. Even the geckos tried finding sanctuary away from this place by crawling all over the walls (and into our luggage) in our mosquito- filled rooms.I have saved the best for last...There is simply NO reason to jepordize your health and safety by staying here. After 2 hours of walking around and getting used to the facility and checking out the filthy room I went back to reception only to see that my personal passport information was STILL on the counter from check- in for all to see, steal and copy. When I mentioned that this information was confidential, I only recieved a blank stare because- again- no one spoke any English. There was no safe key and was told that tomorrow at 9 am someone could sell us one. There are 2 pools.Both were brownish- green and covered with some kind of bubbling ooze that looked toxic. It, too was covered with insects and an oily film of old sunscreen and waste. After one night we left this disease- riddled place and went to a much better property down the beach from this hell- hole and felt that had we stayed any longer then we had that we probably would not be alive to tell fellow travellers to stay far, far away from this hovel and to avoid it like the plague that it is.We are constant travellers and have stayed all over the Carribean and Mexico and always look for good value; never booking a lower star hotel and expecting The Ritz- but we have never seen such a level of filth, sanitation, services or misrepresentation.

This hotel is perfect ONLY if you're on a budget and would like to travel to the Punta Cana area. Before going on this trip, I did a lot of research and found that most all-inclusives in this area are $225 USD a night and up. Alisios is in the $100 USD range (per night). All I have to say is, you get what you paid for. First off, although the outside of the hotel is nice, the rooms need work. A lot of work. Especially the bathrooms. Our shower stall was moldy and the water was salty (I think its ocean water). Our toilet was faulty. The balconies have no window screens, which allowed for mosquitoes to enter the room. The best amenities the hotel has are its pools and the beach. The food was okay overall. Better on some days than on others. On our third day, we decided to eat lunch at the cafe next door on the beach (not part of the hotel) to break up the routine. The drinks were a bit syrupy. However, the bartenders will comply if you say mas liquor por favor. The entertainment needs work. The staff does what they can to entertain. We were there 4 nights and the entertainment was only good on 2 nights. One night they had a beach party with dancing, etc. and another night they had a cabaret-type dance group come to perform. The music can be quite loud at times. Especially if you're trying to take a nap before dinner. When it comes down to it, it seems that the problem is with management itself. The staff works very hard and they do what they can to make you feel comfortable. However, the poor room quality and entertainment is out of their control. I'm planning to contact the hotel owner about this. Overall, we loved the area; not the hotel. I will definetely stay at a different place when I go back.

This is the worst experience I have ever had and I would not recomment this hotel to anyone. Hotel caters to French tour groups, and non-English speakers. No or few signs were in English and we were not -upon arrival or at any time during our stay- given an orientation on any hotel amentities-location of beach, fitness center, don't drink the water, resturant schedule or any other information. No printed hotel information available in English at front desk or in any room. We are two 40-ish age women traveling together. The room we were given had twin beds on a wooden platform, plastic covered mattress and tissue-thin sheets and our view, 20 feet away, was a building under construction. Room had no hot water and worse, all bathroom water was brackish (salty) and smelled foul. I spent day 2 working to get moved to a different room and was offered a larger room at end of hall with 3 twin beds and no balcony. Day 3 after again spending significant time, got a room with double beds directly over the pool and the disco floor - this cost an additional $20/day. Not the tranquil room I requested but had a balcony and water didn't smell. Every day I had room malfunctions that were not repaired despite repeated requests -- refridgerator never worked, air conditioner never worked, TV reception was so snowy it was useless, no hot water for 2 days and NO WATER two mornings and mid day. Additional pleasantires included a day with the lobby bathroom not working and unclean [feces beside the toilet which I reported to front desk, and 3 hours later it hadn't been cleaned up...] and the entire 6 day trip a beach-side bathrrom that isn't maintained -- no toilet seat, stinky and feces on toilet bowl and back. Gross is an understatement. Beachfront is for about 10 rooms the rest of us walked a short distance down the paved street. Nightly entertainment with blaring music pool-side from 9:30-11:00pm is inescapable anywhere on the property. Music and activities throughout the day pool-side so don't plan on quite relaxation. Hotel is surrounded by active new construction that starts when the rooster crows (literally). The staff are pleasant and the food is good typical of the DR which some people may not like if all you want is American fare. Only drink I would recommend is straight rum and lots of it to cope.

We chose this hotel because it was the cheapest one available last minute. Our flight from Vancouver, british columbia was $96 canadian dollars plus taxes each return flight. We stayed 3 nights room only which was $72 canadian on the internet that i found through trip advisor. For 4 nights all inclusive for the two of us was $104. All inclusive is a better deal because the few restaurants that are around the hotel are not cheap. You can walk along the beach to the right and find two nice restaurants with good food and a beautiful, fun atmosphere. The owner at hurricane grill was rude to us so I would recommend the restaurant farther down with the candles and the outdoor lounging furniture. Their food and drink were delicious! So we only speak english which was a big problem at this hotel if you enjoy good service. Ordering drinks was hard. It was either pina colada or beer. The bartenders didn't understand margarita, martini, or daiquiri! Most hotel guests were from France. So if you speak french or spanish you can enjoy the nightly entertainment. Since the hotel had no budget for the shows, the entertainment was really bad and boring. For example kareokee or games like having two contestants collect things from the audience. I'm used to seeing fabulous dancing.There's nothing to do once it gets dark besides drinking or watching t.v. We watched a lot of t.v and played boardgames since we couldn't socialize with the language barrier. Dinner isn't open until 7:30. The food is buffet so you can most likely find something out of the unusual food. I think some of the food is left overs from the barbeque lunch on the beach. Every time we ate dinner our table was not cleaned off. Meaning dirty plates and no cutlery or water. You have to get things yourself. It was frustrating.The dessert tasted bad but the coffee was the best I've had! I think it was the rich cream. If you want to eat a la carte at the Mexican restaurant you have to book right away. It's only open 3 or 4 days a week. We booked on Saturday for reservations Tuesday. We never made it because we were to sick. It's been 11 days and I still have stomach cramps and diarreah. I think it was their unsanitary way of washing the cups that got me sick. They were using a bucket of discusting, dirty water to wash and rinse the cups with since they had no purified water on tap. The rooms were 2 stars. Kind of dark. The air conditioning leaked water and the sliding doors didn't lock. Mosquitos would enter our room during house cleaning but they weren't unbearable. The beach is the most important for us and the ocean was warm  beautiful for swimming! The sand was white and the weather was perfect. The pools are pretty nice. The sun burnt most people including us so bring extra sunscreen! We had painful burns that kept us out ot the sun for 2 days. The catamaran was awesome! You need and all inclusive bracelet to use it and no experience is needed. The gym was good, and was part of the nice hotel that is connected to alisios. This hotel is pretty small. It's three hotels in one because there are 3 different names to it but it seems like one small hotel. Suenio resort and spa is the nicest with its own private restaurant and beautiful accomadations. This section of the hotel is more elegant. Then there's ORQUIDEA CLUB which isn't any differnt from Alisios except rooms by the pool that are probably nicer inside.
