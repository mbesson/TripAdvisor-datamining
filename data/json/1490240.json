The European breakfast was beautifully presented, and thoughtfully put together. Front desk staff Antonio and Magdelena were friendly, courteous and helpful, and handled our transfer bookings from port to hotel and from hotel to airport with no fuss. This is one of the best value for money hotels we have stayed in anywhere in the world, and we would happily recommend Villa Pinciana to anyone looking for classy, quiet, affordable accommodation in Rome. One little glitch - the hotel recommended we use GLT for a \"hop-on, hop-off\" bus service while in Rome, and were able to provide us with a ticket (Euro 64 for 48 hours) at their front desk. We would not recommend GLT at all - they were Euro 12 more expensive than other operators, seemed very inefficient with their operation - long waits between pick-ups - and their drivers and staff had a \"couldn't care less\" attitude to their customers.

Another factor in our decision to book this hotel was the advertised roof-top terrace. While there is a lovely roof-top terrace, there is very little patio furniture there. We were travelling as a group of 6 people, but the terrace had only 4 chairs and a small table when there was room for much more. There is a lovely patio that we used each day for breakfast. The rooms were beautiful, but a little small. The included daily breakfast buffet was okay although were not as good as what we had experienced at the other hotels during our trip.

Unfortunately we were slightly disappointed as we had higher expectations for a four star hotel. The hotel really does have a great location being very close to Via Veneto, Villa Borghese and 10 min. walk to the Spanish Steps and it is actually its main advantage - quiet area and in the same time it is close to everything. Looks like when making the hotel the main efforts have been put in the outside area and the first floor where the reception and breakfast area is. The room we stayed in (we had a booking for 5 nights) was nothing extraordinary, it looked like any other hotel room and did not have that boutique Italian charm stated in the advertisement. We were lucky to have a balcony but there were no any chairs so we didn't use it. Bathroom was nice but I personally found not very comfortable that there was no place to put shampoo or soap in the shower cabin (just on the floor), towels were of poor quality with some old stains and were not changed every day. The same about bed linen - for the five nights we stayed our bed sheets we not changed, we complained to the guy on the reception on the forth morning but even then they didn't change the sheets, I can say that for sure because the bed sheet had a hole that was sewn and there was a patch and I kept seeing this patch on the sheet for 5 nights (I even took a photo), This is something I cannot accept for a four star hotel and for the price we paid (more than 200 euro per night)! The air-conditioner in the room was too noisy so we had to switch it off as if you stay in the room longer it will definitely cause you headache. We were told on the reception that it is not just our room that has this noisy problem so we had to cope with this; fortunately it wasn't too hot in Rome. Sandrine and Magdalena on reception were very nice and very helpful with everything we asked for something I cannot say about the blond guy with glasses whose name I unfortunately didn't notice. He was supposed to give us a wakeup call on the morning of our departure, we asked for that wakeup call but nobody called, good we didn't missed the flight! He said he called somebody but obviously it wasn\u2019t us, ridiculous! Except for Sandrine and Magdalena the other hotel staff had difficulties to understand/speak English even those that served the breakfast and although the girls that served the breakfast were one and the same they kept asking us every morning for the number of the room which I personally found annoying. Breakfast itself was OK but a bit limited choice, bread and pastry were not fresh. Limo service provided from the hotel to the airport was excellent, better use it instead of other companies like we did on our arrival using Romacabs - the driver was terrible, was speeding, not speaking English and obviously not knowing the directions very well as he was using navigation to find the hotel. This hotel could be a really nice place to stay but unfortunately there are some gaps in the service and some details that make you feel disappointed. It is a shame because with this location and architecture Villa Pinciana has a great potential and can offer far better service for that price range.", "Date": "September 28, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Location": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Poway, California", "Title": "\u201cPerfect Small Hotel with Huge Charm\u201d", "Author": "Mary S", "ReviewID": "UR118016718", "Content": "A well-groomed 25 room hotel in a nice area of Rome where you can walk to restaurants, shops and even walk or catch a bus to the Spanish Steps and other historical sites.

We booked a single room for the four of us online several months in advance\u2026and the reservation went through without any issues. About one week before our stay we were sent a very nice e-mail offering to arrange for transport between the airport (FCO) and the hotel. Their rate was virtually the same as a cab would have been\u2026and they sent a far more roomy and comfortable van. The hotel is as clean, charming, and classically European as it looks on their website; and we were welcomed by name upon arriving, which I always appreciate. The room (which I booked as a quad-occupancy) was prepared for us with a king and two roll-away beds. In truth, it is sized like an oversized double and was a little tight for the four of us but I expected as much since the \u2018classic\u2019 European hotels seem to be set up for two. We were just happy to \"bond\" and save a little money by sharing a quad...I knew there would be a trade-off. Size notwithstanding, the room was clean and beautifully decorated with ample room for our bags and to hang our clothes. The location of the hotel is about two blocks off the top end of the Via Veneto (near Villa Borghese) and about a ten-minute walk to the nearest Metro Station. While the location might be a bit removed from Rome\u2019s key attractions for some people, my family and I enjoy walking different routes as a form of exploration and getting away from the more crowded areas of town. We were very happy with the location. One great surprise was the number of excellent restaurants within walking distance of the hotel\u2026and I\u2019m NOT referring to the overpriced ones lining the Via Veneto\u2026although we ate at a couple of those, too. My family and I were out about town for most of our stay and don\u2019t typically eat in our hotels, thus I can\u2019t comment on Villa Pinciana's restaurant and other services - although they have a very nice patio on the property. The desk attendant was extremely helpful when I needed her urgently to print our ticket voucher for the Colosseum just one hour prior to our assigned time and was walking in the Villa Borghese when I discovered my error. The rest of the staff was just as friendly for the few times we interacted with them. I would not only stay again at the Villa Pinciana but would recommend the hotel to other families or couples staying in Rome; particularly after having previously stayed at a couple of the far pricier 5L-star hotels in town.

Thought he looked too good to be a driver, indeed, we were conned by his 'note swapping scam'! Asking for 15 euros, my jet lagged husband had given him a 20, but he claimed it was only a 5 ... So, do be careful. Anyway, this nice Hotel has not only honoured our booking of one of their best suites, the Suite Borghese on the 4th floor of the Hotel but they had also kept all our packages that were sent from Venice. There was only this suite on the top floor of the Hotel, along with a small sitting area and terrace for all guests. So, it still feels very private and romantic. The wow factor of this suite has to be two different terraces, with one bigger one with chairs and table on it. The views were of neighbouring villas, embassies and churches - nice way to end our Rome trip! Bed was very comfy, so was the 3 seater sofa (huge)! TV was large with English channels and if I did not remember wrongly, Wifi was also free! Common areas are all laid out in yellow, dark brown and white marbles - classy! Oil paintings, Murano glass chandeliers and classical furnitures abound - my favourites! There was also 2 or 3 nice little gardens surrounding the Hotel with chairs and table for sitting - good for better weather. Ample parking also seems to be available on site. And why did I rate such a high price/quality ratio hotel only 4 stars? Two reasons - we slept like babies in the quiet suite, in preparation for our 13 hours long flight home the next day, only to be awaken by a bright white emergency light at 4.45am! A call to the Reception had confirmed my worst fears - they had trouble with the electrical supply! And normal power did not return till one hour later ...luckily had my eye masks with me. The other reason has to be the Hotel's location - it was shown on our GPS that the Hotel was exactly 1.5km from the Spanish Steps area and such equipments don't lie. True to the fact, it was a long way up a hill, albeit a small hill. After all that walking, shopping and sightseeing, this had proven quite a daunting task for us, especially at the end of the day. Thus, in my honest opinion, this Hotel is most suited for people who has seen much of Rome has to offer, like us. If you are a first or second time visitor to Rome and would like to catch what Rome has to offer to the average tourist, then this Hotel's location is not very suitable.

If you're flying into Fiumicino airport then the train at the airport (Leonardo Express) into Termini costs 14 euros one way and a white taxi trip from the Termini to the hotel should cost no more than 8-10 euros (beware the rogue taxi drivers hanging around the station entrance!). I would probably take the bus from Termini - see hotel website for bus numbers - rather than take the metro. The hotel was a former embassy and has been beautifully renovated, rooms was very clean and spacious and the hotel is quietly located. Breakfast was good - warm croissants, selection of hams and cheeses, cereals, but tinned fruit and juices were from a carton. Ask the waitress if you want a cappuccino or expresso and she will make it fresh for you. Reception staff were very helpful and provided a map of the city with bus numbers already written in which was useful. The Via Veneto is 5 mins walk away with all its big hotels and Harry's Bar, Cafe de Paris - expect to pay 8 euros for a soft drink and 14 euros for a cocktail in any of these places and for me the Via Veneto just lacks atmosphere and 'when in Rome' I would much rather go down and sit and have a meal in one of the restaurants overlooking the Pantheon in Piazza della Rotunda, etc. Walking down to the Spanish Steps is 10 mins away and to the Pantheon and Trevi Fountain 20-30 mins. The Colosseum and Vatican are more of a hike to walk from the hotel - Colosseum about 40 mins and for the Vatican I would take the bus or metro . If you want to be very central, I can recommend the Villa Pinciana's sister hotel called the Boutique Hotel Trevi and I stayed there 2 years ago - its location is excellent and right besides its namesake so great if you don't want too much walking, especially at night. I would stay here again, if I got a good deal, otherwise the best places to stay for convenience are around the Spagna area - Via Babuino/Via Condotti, around the Trevi Fountain or the Pantheon or Piazza Navona.

When we arrived completely overheated from the sweltering sun we were checked in immediately and sent to our room to cool off. Once we were showered and relaxed we returned to pick up our passports and the lady at the front desk gave us tons of information about the neighborhood, hotel, amenities and had even personally annotated a map listing all the various public transportation options and how to get to major cultural attractions. She suggested a fabulous restaurant nearby (not owned by the hotel ) which served authentic food from Abruzzo which was exceptional and had the best service we found in Rome. We found all the staff at the front desk very helpful. When our flight left late at night we were allowed to keep all our luggage at the hotel and have a full day of sight seeing with out lugging around our stuff. Although we stayed in our room until 12-1pm on certain days we were never interrupted or disturbed by housekeeping. The only flaw in service is that the girls in the breakfast room were a little distant and so you really have to assert yourself to get a specialty coffee (there are pitchers of American coffee readily available). The breakfast was great and was available from 7 am to 10:30 so it was never crowded and the patio made for a nice alternative. In a converted Palazzo with only about 25 rooms there is a really intimate and personal feeling to this hotel.

The bath was large and marble with plenty of towels, all sorts of complimentary stuff aside from the normal shampoo and soap including shaving kit, vanity, slippers, toothbrushes and more. It did not have a terrace which might have been nice but honestly it was so hot the last week of August I am not sure we really would have used it. Instead the patio shaded by the trees was really fine for our purposes. The air conditioning worked like a charm which is more than I can say for several places we stayed.

The outdoor terrace was quiet and an a great place to have an after dinner drink or breakfast in the morning. Having said that I must qualify the but. Prior to going to Rome I was warned of all the scams...the baby, the ring, the gypsies, pickpockets etc. But there were 2 scams that I was not aware of. On our first day in Rome, while walking down the street by our hotel we were stopped by a man in a car asking directions to Milan. We explained that we were from NY and unaware of directions. He proceeded to tell us that he worked for Versace and forgot how to get out of Rome. There was some friendly chitchat about NYC and then he told us that he was going to give us 2 sample leather jackets from Versace. Well, we were taken aback and questioned his motives. He assured us he was on the level and handed the jackets to my husband in a shopping bag. Then he proceeded to tell us that he needed gas money. With this my husband throws the jackets back into the car and tells him to get lost. Who knows what that was all about? The other qualifier was a bit more serious. On my last night in Rome I got a call from a friend in the states at 1am saying that she had just received an email from me asking for $1550 dollars because my bag was stolen in UK and I was stranded. Earlier that day I had used the hotel's computer to send an email to my son about phone trouble I was having. The hotel provided me with a user name and password so I didn't think twice about the security of the computer. When I went back later to check my emails my account was not recognizing my password. I thought it odd but passed it off as a problem with the hotel's computer. Little did I know that sometime between the 2 computer logins someone had stolen my email account. I was frantic and really worried about identity fraud. I spent the next 2 hours calling my banks and credit card companies. Fortunately the damage was limited to people on my contact list being bombarded with this crazy email. Luckily from the way it was written they knew it couldn't have possibly come from me. But it was very upsetting. The hotel staff was not very receptive to what had happened and tried to blow it off. Not the response I wanted. Meanwhile I saw people were still using the computer.

I would certainly stay here again at our next visit!", "Date": "May 26, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Rooms": "4", "Service": "4", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "London", "Title": "\u201cLovely hotel that just needs to adjust a few tiny things to earn an \"excellent\" rating\u201d", "Author": "TGoodall", "ReviewID": "UR63417422", "Content": "I stayed here recently with my partner and overall, thought it was a lovely hotel and a blessed relief from the larger, blander hotels (which I generally steer clear of anyway). Beautiful building, lovely greeting by the woman on reception when we arrived, very clean and beautiful room (we were lucky enough to have a terrace), friendly and helpful staff in general and a fantastic breakfast. Oh, and free parking - how incredible in the centre of Rome! However, there are just a few things that I felt would have made a difference, given that this hotel is denoted as Four Star Superior. Firstly, and this is something that too many hotels slip up on, the hairdryer was one of those attached to the wall which looks like the hose of a vacuum cleaner and in no way can be used to style your hair. For many women, this is a potential trip-spoiler - especially in a city like Rome where elegance is called for and you dress up in fabulous frocks when you go out. These hairdryers are not acceptable in my book in any hotel boasting four or more stars. Plastic cups were provided in the mini-bar - again, not befitting this sort of establishment. And where were the robes? Again, I would expect any hotel with four stars or more to offer these. We had a lovely terrace, but there was no wandering out onto it in the morning without having to pull on clothes, rather than just don a robe. And, even if we hadn't had a terrace, I would still expect robes to be provided. The towels - they were large, but of thin material which spoke of a three-star establishment and again, just jarred with the quality of the furnishings and the overall image. We went down to look at the Wellness Area, but would not use the jacuzzi - the water looked far too murky for our liking. Finally, I had a bit of a crisis as I went to iron a top. I asked for an iron to be brought up and was told that there was not a single iron in the hotel. The reason is that in Rome irons apparently present a safety hazard and therefore it is more unusual than usual to find a hotel with an iron. I'm sure there must be ways around this without having to think ahead to use the laundry service. It would be helpful to know about this in advance, as to me it is the most normal thing in the world to expect an iron. I fear this list makes it sound as though I didn't enjoy my stay, and this is not the case. I thought it was a beautiful hotel and I would stay there again. But, the idea of taking my own hairdryer, robe and glasses does make me balk a little. I just want to see this hotel reach its true potential with some small adjustments. Clearly, plenty of money and taste has gone into creating this hotel, and some tiny details are letting it down.", "Date": "May 6, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Dublin, Ireland", "Title": "\u201cElegant hotel in central location with friendly, efficient & helpful staff\u201d", "Author": "Mary196316", "ReviewID": "UR58730306", "Content": "We stayed in Hotel Villa Pinciana for a weekend in March.

For us was the 4th time in Rome, last one in Febryrary 2009 and for our friends, was the first time. Staying in Villa Pinciana was a real surprise and a pleasure. We were supposed to stay in hotel Sistina, one of the Leonardi Hotels, that we\u00b4ve choosen because of the location, in spite of not so good rerviews in the Trip Advisor. When we arrived to Hotel Sistina, they told us that they had overbooked as many as five rooms, so they offered to us three other hotels to stay. Initially we were reluctant, because we insisted in the excellent location of the Sistina, and in spite of the fact that the first impression of the Sistina was awful. When when we arrived to Hotel Villa Pinciana we felt immediately that really were extremely fortunate for the change. Villa Pinciana is a brand new hohtel, beautifully decorated, that apparently was an ancient house with a patio around the hotel. The personnel at the front desk are friendly, helpful and they solved every single request from all of us. The girl at the front desk when we arrived was called Sandrine, I think, and she was extremely helpful. The hotel is located about two minutes walk from Via Venetto and about ten minutes walk from Piazza Barberini, wherre you can take the Metro to all places. But you can take the bus 52, 53 and 65 to all places too and the bus stop is one minute walk from the hotel. Villa PInciana has a nice Gym, Sauna and Steam bath facilities, internet in your own room, using an ethernet cable that they can lend you. Besides there is a beautiful and cozy parlor where you can sit down and read the newspaper, watch tv or use the internet in a computer that they have there. The rooms are exquisitely decorated too, with enough sockets where you can charge the cellular phone, use your computer and really feel at home. Besides, they have a security box in the room and all details in the bathroom like the shower cap, soap, Q tips, facial tissues, shower jelly and body cream. The room is large enough to feel comfortable and besides has a nice LCD tv. No English or Spanish speaking channels. The bathroom has enough towels, so that you feel comfortable. The breakfast is really the highlight of all the beautiful and magnificent details of this hotel. The breakfast is very complete and the two persons in charge are elegantly dressed and they are friendly and very very helpful to all requests. As a matter of fact one of our friends wanted to take the breakfast to the room for her husband and the attendant in the breakfast room had the detail to bring a tray,wrapped with a napkin and everything well presented. They offer coffe, including expresso or american coffe, hot chocolate, two different juices (pineapple and orange), different cold cuts, croissants, and other hot pastries, all of them delicious. Also boiled eggs, a large variety of cereals, fruit cocktial, peachs in syrup, yogurts, breads (all kinds), jelly, butter and really all that you need to start your visit in the beautiful Rome. Very close to the hotel there are different places to have a beer, coffe or lunch and dinner. Our best buy was a restaurant -Il Pomodorino- that is open until late. The service is good and the menu is varied and excellent. They also have a special menu for each day. One day one of us ate Pasta and clams and although slightly spicy, was delicious. In our last night I ate Pasta with shrimps and antichokes. Really delicious. In general all that we ate in Il Pomodorino was good and reasonably priced. In Febryary 2009, my wife and myself stayed in the Domus Romana hotel in Via Quattro Fontana and I wrote a review in Tripadvisor for the Domus Romana, but although my review for the Domus Romana was good, Villa Pinciana is superb. If I would return to Rome, definitely I would return to Villa Pinciana because it is beautiful, exquisitely decorated, the personnel is excellent, all details are outstanding and in general because it is a real gem in Rome.", "Date": "December 2, 2009"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Hotel Villa Pinciana", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g187791-d1490240-Reviews-Hotel_Villa_Pinciana-Rome_Lazio.html", "Price": "$177 - $379*", "Address": "<address><span rel=\"v:address\"><span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">Via Abruzzi, 11</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:postal-code\">00187</span> <span property=\"v:locality\">Rome</span></span>, <span class=\"country-name\" property=\"v:country-name\">Italy</span> </span></span></address>", "HotelID": "1490240", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/01/b2/06/21/esterno.jpg"}}
