Small rooms. A bit quirky.\u201d", "Author": "KanataMike", "ReviewID": "UR126333333", "Content": "Sydney is an expensive and difficult city for hotel rooms. If you are searching on-line for a room, rates can double or triple overnight. The Castlereagh is in a good location and comes at a fair price for downtown Sydney. It is close to the busses, trains and shopping and eating areas. It's clean and the rooms are well maintained. The staff are helpful and the carpets and furnishings are generally good quality. The hotel is located in the HQ building of the New South Wales Freemasons. I am guessing that the hotel rooms were originally occupied by members staying overnight because they are very small and there is no storage space. The rooms are large enough for a single occupant but if you have a spouse, partner or anyone else camping in your room, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a bit cramped. The window came with frosted glass - probably just as well since it overlooked a brick wall and a building site. A kettle was provided along with tea and coffee supplies but no power point for the kettle. (You can plug it into one of the bathroom sockets or one of the sockets on the floor). Wifi is available in every room but make sure that this is included in your room rate otherwise you will be charged $10 a day.

After I booked I was a tad skeptical because with a price that was anywhere from 1/3 to 1/2 of other hotels in the vicinity, the deal seemed too good to be true. In fact I really enjoyed my 5 night stay at the Castlereaugh. Without a doubt, I would stay there again. The location, friendly staff, and slightly above basic room features made this a hotel a great deal. My check-in was very quick and I have to thank Louis at the front desk for his incredibly quick, attentive, and professional service. He was always very quick and to provide me with my key on the many comings and going from the hotel. Room 609 was very spacious and had two twin beds. I was a single traveler so there was plenty of space to spare. DOn't expect a view though. The glass is smoked so you can't see out but some light is let in. On my last night I stayed in room 807 (a single and rather tight) because I added the last night on at the last minute. However, the absence of a view isn't really a big deal because there is nothing to see outside except other buildings and a skyscraper that is going up next to the Castlereaugh. There is a noise issue with this hotel though because a skyscraper is being constructed literally right next to the hotel. I always sleep with earplugs in and this would be a good idea here. In my grading, I'm not faulting the hotel because it's really out of their control. However, it is an unavoidable nuisance. The noises started around 7am and ceased around 6pm. At times the noise level was quite elevated. My two rooms were nicely but basically furnished. Both had a small desk, a smallish closet, and a minibar fridge. The wifi had it moments of strength but more often than not the signal was a bit on the weak side. The bathrooms in both rooms were probably the best feature. Not that they were spacious mind you, but there was lots of water pressure in the shower and I loved the wide shower head (they look like a sunflower or the type Holiday Inn Express uses in the USA). The tiling in the showers was very classy too. In fact the oddest feature of the entire room was having to step up into the bathroom. I found myself tripping over the ledge many a time. The bedding was okay but not dazzling. Don't expect Westin bedding at this price. The mattress was on the firm side. I've slept in a lot worse beds and there are extra comforters tucked in the closet. Not once did I need the air conditioning though I did test it to see if it works; and it did. Location is really what this hotel is about. The value of being about a 10 min walk to Darling Harbour, two blocks from either Town Hall or St James Cityrail stops, and half a block from a bus stop is immense. The easiest and fastest way to Circular Quay was walking to St James station and then taking the train to the next stop which is Circular Quay. There are numerous buses that depart Circular Quay and head down Castlreaugh St, so it's never more than few minutes for a bus. There are restaurants everywhere and plenty of snack shops too. You'll never have to walk more than a half a block to find something to eat. I made frequent stops at the Woolworth store that is attached to the Town Hall Station. I stocked up on fresh fruit, veggies, and inexpensive priced snacks for my munching between meals. Queen Victoria Building and all of the associated shopping is also two blocks away. Lastly, the staff were exceptionally friendly. Sophe and Louis at the front desk were real stand outs. It was a nice to be recognized by them after all the comings and goings (you leave your key at the front desk when leaving the property). The Castereagh is not what I would truly label a boutique hotel. There is much character in this building especially in the lobby. This is an endearing part of the hotel, but the hotel doesn't make any claim to be trendy or even fashionable. The rooms are clean, functional, and as one would expect for the price, they were on the comfortable side of basic. I give this hotel 4 stars because the staff were so kind and warm and the location is so central. But this is not a 4 star in the normal sense as I would expect a Hilton, Marriott, or Sheraton to be. You will go without the extras like a fitness center, a pool, a doorman, and a concierge. Guests that spend long days out of the room exploring the city or doing business then return looking for a relaxing place to rest that is both economical and yet comforting should find the Castereaugh a pleasant place.", "Date": "February 26, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Stafford, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cGreat location and friendly staff\u201d", "Author": "nickandsarah88", "ReviewID": "UR124116787", "Content": "The hotel has a great location, and i think they should advertise it more as it only a 10 minute walk to Darling harbour, 20 minutes to Circular Quay, and take a right out of the hotel and within 10 minutes or so there is a great selection of restaurants and bars. You can walk everywhere and it is really close to Museum station and James Station. When we walked in we thought the hotel looked very posh, and the reception area was very nice, but the room didn't seem to equate to the 4star rating. Although it was very comfortable and clean, it was dated and very small. We didn't want a massive room as we spent most of our time exploring the city and only use the room to sleep in, but it would've been nice to have a little extra floor space. The staff were great, very friendly and helpful. The shuttle bus they arranged for us was very convenient and cheaper than public transport, so i would recommend that. They even recommended blue mountain tours and vantage points for the fireworks prior to our stay, and whilst we were there, did everything they could to ensure we had a comfortable and enjoyable stay, whilst seeing everything we wanted to. The hotel was very quiet, even though it was over the new years period and the staff were great, and whilst the location was ideal and was just what we wanted, the room could've been slightly bigger.

The Castlereagh has a wonderful lobby and the first impression made there is very positive. That impression ends at the door to your room. They've put cheap discount store door knobs on many entries which look silly and function poorly. Light fixtures in the bathroom also appear to have come from a home improvement store. There is a cup hook screwed into the plaster, apparently for the room key. On a positive note, the shower worked very well with a good spray and nice, hot water. The television in our room is shimmed up on a couple of wooden blocks, presumably to keep it from falling off the fiber board shelf that is so obviously overtaxed with the burden of the ancient set.

The location is excellent -- walkable to most tourist destinations. The lobby is very nice, and the neighborhood is safe. The staff is friendly and helpful, and housekeeping does a good job. The bad: Management is miserly. Broken windows were not repaired, furniture and fixtures were shabby, broken brass railing in elevator was held in place with duct tape. Hotel breakfast was overpriced and minimal, bartender obviously wished she were somewhere else. Noisy throughout building from construction next door (though there's not much management can do about that.) The ugly: Guest rooms were not just small, they were extraordinarily gloomy. Walls were painted a dark mustard, adding to the claustrophobia. Lamps were glued (!) to end tables, making it difficult to read in bed. There was only one small window; dirty, yellow frosted glass reinforced with chicken wire. The tiny, ghastly-lit bathroom had a sink the size of a drinking fountain. The exhaust fan sounded like a jet engine, and every faucet had loose handles. After two nights staying in one of these depressing cells, I asked at the front desk if I could have a room with a little more light. They cheerfully re-assigned me to another single room with a double bed on an upper floor. Before packing up and moving my stuff, I went up to check out the new room. It was exactly the same as the old one. However, for $10 more per night, I took a \"Queen\" room at the front of the hotel. Much more space, with a large clear-glass window (though cracked and repaired with packing tape) that let in ample light. A little more noise from the street, but definitely worth the move. In short: The Castlereagh is cheap, but... well, cheap. It's too bad that such a noble old building is being run into the ground.

It is also within walking distance (more like 20 minutes) of a lot of major attractions such as Cockle Bay where you can go to the aquarium/IMAX/maritime museum and also Darling Harbour and the Sydney Opera House. The staff were helpful and polite. The hotel itself feels quite secure. Our room was quite small and the double bed was not full size. I am 5 foot 10 and my feet basically hung off the end of it.

However, this meant early in the morning - about 7-8AM - the drills and machinery would start up, making it impossible to sleep. When we were there the construction had only just begun, so unless you're an early riser anyway or just love the sound of drills I would avoid this hotel for a while.

If you want free Wifi though there is a McDonalds around the corner from the hotel. There is a 'restaurant' offering dinner in the hotel but unless you like toasted cheese sandwiches I wouldn't bother. Just venture out to one of the many nice restaurants within walking distance.

Very convenient to the great shopping to be found on Pitt Street (big name boutiques galore). Walking off the street and into the lobby is like walking back in time and into the glamor of the 1930's or 40's. Shining floors, huge vases of flowers, dark gleaming woodwork everywhere you look. The elevators are a bit slow, but I liked the security offered by the key system (the elevator will not work unless you insert your room key to indicate which floor you want). Cello's Restaurant was closed while we were there, but there was a second floor Lounge that offered good drinks and tolerable food. When I go back, Ill skip the Lounge and walk down to Palace Chinese.

One previous reviewer had stated that the furniture was 'old'. Yes, it was, but old as in antique quality, not tatty and worn out. The reception staff were very friendly and dealt quickly with our check-in. One thing that really pleased me was the security key needed to operate the lift to our floor. Often, less expensive hotels and backpackers have no security, with anyone free to walk in. Our twin room was larger than most hotel rooms, even five star hotels' lead in priced rooms are often smaller. The bathroom had been renovated, with a good large shower, basin and toilet. The beds were very comfortable, the linen impeccable. If you want a view, don't stay here - pay triple and stay at the Quay. The frosted glass windows let in adequate light, and they also opened. Being a narrow hotel running back from the road, the rooms were free of street noise. Even though the hotel appeared full, we had no noise problems apart from the noisy shower next door. The location was great - close to the monorail, railway and bus stop, which I needed for Dad to be able to get around with comfort. If you are a shopaholic, Sydney's main department stores are only 50 metres away, and the beautiful QV Building just round the corner.

Generally, the room and bathroom were clean and nicely decorated, but there were a few drawbacks - the step up to the bathroom (hard when you are trying not to disturb a sleeping roommate), and the lack of a real window (a very narrow one with opaque glass, that couldn't be opened). Also, while the room was a good double, the second bed was not really adequate for a twin, being one of those quasi-couches that have bolsters which must be removed to use it as a bed. A friend had booked a single, which had only a single bed. However, it had a better window, and was very pleasant. In fact the staff apologised for its smallness. It appears some of the front rooms had better windows. We had none of the noise problems others complained of. Meals, bars etc were lovely, as were all the staff, including the workmen who were renovating some floors, and even the firemen who answered an alarm while we were there. We even received a free drink voucher each day. Most of all, the location was very convenient, especially for anyone needing to be in the city centre.

In addition, it was \"freezing cold\" - there was no way in which the air condition system can be adjusted. I had to wear 3 layers of clothing to bed but despite that, I was shivering.

Later in the day, I was allocated a room on the 10th room away from the elevator end. I could hear loud \"jarring\" noises when I went into the room. I thought it was some drilling noise due to renovations and that would stop at night. However, the noise seemed to carry on. I found this out the next morning when the receptionist told me that my room was very near the air-conditioning system. On that day, I managed to secure a heater after I met their cleaner who advised me to get one from the reception as the air condition system cannot be fixed. So, I spent the second night again sleepless due to the noise and had to constantly turned on and off the small broken heater which also made a very loud noise due to the fan. The next morning, I asked for a change of room. Finally, I got a room that has very little noise and not so cold.

We only had 3 criticisms. 1/. The windows are very old single - glazing, so you need to insist on a room away from extractor fans, if you sleep lightly. 2/. Breakfast is only served until 9.00 am, even at weekends. 3/. There are 2 bars. The ground floor lounge is very pleasant, but the upstairs one is more reminiscent of a cheap amusement arcade. Don't let these points put you off, though. We would certainly stay there again. We were especially fond of the main breakfast waitress, who was so friendly and helpful, even lending us her discount pass for the Zoo !", "Date": "July 20, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Wollongong", "Title": "\u201cLovely quaint old fashioned service\u201d", "Author": "melwollongong", "ReviewID": "UR4933486", "Content": "We stayed for one night at the end of March. Although our deluxe room was small, it was very classy and clean. Lovely soft sheets, gorgeous paintings and old worlde antique style furniture. It felt like staying in an old mansion, but we were right in the heart of Sydney. Our room included a complimentary drink in the bar which was divine, there are even a few poker machines. Light continental breakfast was included and the restaurant was divine. For an old hotel, it is extremely well maintained. I could not fault this place and will definitely stay again. The only disadvantage was that there is no on-site parking. You can park at the Picadilly carpark for about $14 overnight, our room rate was $155 which was an absolute bargain for the location.", "Date": "April 4, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "4", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cGreat value for money\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR3309824", "Content": "We stayed in this hotel for 5 nights over new year eve 2004. We had problems booking a hotel for obvious reasons over this period and were relieved to simply find some accomodation. We paid considerably less for the accomodation than we expected to at this time of year, and it represents excellent value for money, we got a lot more than we expected for what we paid. We were very pleasantly suprised when we arrived to efficient staff and an impressive lobby area, everything was clean and well kept. We had a queen room, that was well appointed and comfortable. The bathroom was quite small for the size of the room, but the shower was good and clean! Although breakfast was fairly basic, it was substantial and of good quality. The dining room was fantastic, probably made to look even better as it was very tastefully decorated for xmas. Overall, we had a fantastic time in Sydney and would recommend this hotel to anyone that enjoys good quality and value for money. We would have paid twice as much for the same standard of room and service in a 'branded' hotel.", "Date": "March 29, 2005"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Castlereagh Boutique Hotel", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g255060-d257288-Reviews-Castlereagh_Boutique_Hotel-Sydney_New_South_Wales.html", "Price": "$176 - $196*", "Address": "<address class=\"addressReset\"><span rel=\"v:address\"><span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">169 Castlereagh Street</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:locality\">Sydney</span>, <span property=\"v:region\">New South Wales</span> <span property=\"v:postal-code\">2000</span></span>, <span class=\"country-name\" property=\"v:country-name\">Australia</span> </span></span></address>", "HotelID": "257288", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/ProviderThumbnails/dirs/ca/55/ca55bea083c0d894352ea632d6ce7f797large.jpg"}}
