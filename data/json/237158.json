Word of warning, the reviews discussing the noise and bed firmness are not exaggerating. There was a lot of noise from the strip until around 5am (this is during the week) even with the windows closed. The walls are also fairly thin so you can hear people talking in the rooms on either side of you. We were pretty tired each night so we fell asleep with no problems but bring ear plugs just in case. There is also a/c so leaving the window closed to cut down the noise was not a problem at all. The beds were very, very firm but we both slept soundly on them. The desk staff is extremely friendly and spoke English fluently. The rooms were cleaned well and I have no complaints about the water pressure or accomodations. The breakfast was okay (store bought pastries, coffee/juice from machines) but we ate there every day as it was convenient and available when we were awake (the rest of the city seemed to sleep in until 9am)! Internet was available free from the hotel, beware if you are using the common room computers as some people seemed to camp out on them for hours. I recommend buying water from the front desk to keep in your room during your stay.", "Date": "May 27, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Malaga, Spain", "Title": "\u201cFab location, this clean, comfortable hotel ticked all \"our boxes\"\u201d", "Author": "MOMOMC60", "ReviewID": "UR110053397", "Content": "The Hotel was basic so if you are looking for luxury then go somewhere else.

The yoghurts being \"long life\" were not refrigerated and I am not keen on warm yoghurt. I dont eat \"carbs\" so croissants are not suitable. Perhaps a provision of fresh fruit at breakfast could have been provided? The rooms (we had a double) were adequate in size, very clean,with clean towels every day. We got a taxi from the airport straight to the Hotel which cost 25 euros, but the staff at the hotel told us about the airport bus (an air conditioned coach) which leaves from Placio de catalunya, situated at the top of La Rambla,every 5 mins and at just over 5 euros each was a much better option!

The hotel we booked was locked when we arrived, so we needed to find a hotel asap to stay. We found Hotel Cuatro Naciones on Las Ramblas. The hotel was nice and clean looking and not too expensive. I think we paid approximately 95 Euro a night. The staff was friendly, professional, and helpful. They also spoke English if required. The double room was basic, but clean. The beds were comfortable, the bathroom was spacious, and the bathtub was big. The water was warm as well as the room when the heater was on. Because the hotel was on Las Ramblas, you could hear the noise outside especially from la placa. By the way, there are several clubs in the placa for young travelers. As for the breakfast, it consisted of cereal, pastries, juice, coffee, and jam. The breakfast host was the most wonderful, friendly older Spaniard. He was wonderful and took pride in his job. Out of most of the people we met in Spain, he was one of the nicest. Above all, all the employees were wonderful. As for location, the hotel is between two Metro stops off Las Ramblas. It is a great location for staying and being able to enjoy the city and people. The streets, off of Las Ramblas, were a little scary at night, but safe during the day. We were two women traveling, so safety was an issue. The streets had transients and beggers, but still safe because the police were present. I would also be careful about theives. Many service employees informed us to watch our bags and we did. Overall, I would stay at the hotel again. If you are going to Barcelona for a while, I would suggest visiting Montserrat and Figures. Both towns are beautiful and quaint. I would also try to see a Flamenco show, which could be seen at Cordobas, which is across the street from the hotel. Also have some sangria and bomba picantes at El Choquito. Although old and graffiti covered, the city of Barcelona is a great place to visit. It is full of history and amazing art. The people were okay, even though sometimes rude.

Other reviews on this site had mentioned what great atmosphere and service was to be had for such a great deal - and they were 100% true, right down to the best part of the establishment - those two lovely, charming gentlemen who insist on carrying your heavy bags to your room, showing you how everything works and helping you with the complimentary continental breakfast every morning. It was clean, spacious, very handy (right in the heart of everything on La Rambla) and the free WiFi service was an added bonus. The only improvement I might suggest is a wider range for the WiFi service all the way up to the 3rd floor as the signal faded on the 1st floor.

The place is very very clean, nothing fancy but it has everything you need if you are just looking for a save and clean place to sleep. It has a PC in the lounge with free internet access and breakfast is included, which is not the great thing but good enough to be included in the price.
