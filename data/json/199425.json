The hotel is a 20 minute tram ride from the city centre, the number M6 tram stop is a couple of hundred yards from the hotel and trams run on time every 10 minutes. We purchased Berlin Welcome Cards at the airport which give you unlimited travel on the city's public transport network and also discounts at several city attractions and tours. We would certainly consider this hotel the next time we visit Berlin", "Date": "March 3, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "London", "Title": "\u201cExceptional Value for Money, Great Breakfast, comfy bed...a perfect 3 star hotel!\u201d", "Author": "EmilyandMattLondon", "ReviewID": "UR121711892", "Content": "We went to Berlin on a flight and hotel deal for late November...and we're glad we picked this hotel! 2 minutes away from the tram stop, and take the No.7 tram to Alexanderplatz in 20 minutes, cant ask for better for the money. Its in 'proper' East Berlin, it truly is a suburb, and the decor is a little dated (but you dont go to Berlin sit in a hotel room!). Couldnt really fault the room generally-the showers were strong and warm, and the beds were comfortable, and the room was a nice warm temperature for the Berlin winter! Breakfast was amazing, featuring pretty much anything you could think of...bacon and scrambled egg, croissants, cheese, cold meat, toast, cereal, fresh fruit, yoghurt, juice...nice and filling for the long and busy Berlin days. Service in the hotel was good too, they let us have breakfast early on our last day when we needed to catch our flight.

Check in was quick and simple and we were soon in our good sized room. Our Twin Bed room also contained a desk, table, two chairs, clothes hanging space with about 8 hangers, shelves, TV and various lamps. The bathroom was also a good size and contained a bath and very good shower. The only problem with the bathroom was the draining from the sink was very slow and also there was no working extractor. The breakfast buffet was also really pleasing and was constantly restocked each day. There was a choice of sausages, streaky bacon, scrambled and hard boiled eggs and a range of cold meats and cheeses. There was also a good selection of breads with a toaster available and also about 10 different types of jams and spreads. There was also cereal, fresh fruit and yoghurt. We were also impressed at the range of drinks available - a selection of teas and coffee. The staff were helpful and polite and also dealt with other requests well, such as a need for 'hot chocolate milk' from the table next to us! Reception staff were approachable and helpful and ordered a taxi for us when leaving which arrived within 10 minutes. WiFi is available through the hotel, but is quite pricey. However if you use the WiFi in the lobby it is free! Lots of people taking advantage of this and sitting downstairs each evening in the lobby with their laptops and iPads. There is a bowling alley downstairs and the restaurant by this does simple snacks. The pizzas we had were really tasty. The location is less than a five minute walk from the nearest tram stop, and the M6 tram only takes about 20 minutes to reach Alexanderplatz. Trams ran every 10 mins throughout the day, and also less frequently throughout the night too. We always managed to get a seat. We were very pleased with this hotel and would definitely stay here again if visiting Berlin another time.", "Date": "August 30, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Prague, Czech Republic", "Title": "\u201cVery Good Budget Hotel\u201d", "Author": "jrussellpowell", "ReviewID": "UR117028719", "Content": "Stayed on a weekend trip to Berlin and was satisfied; not blown away, but very satisfied for a budget hotel. The quality of the hotel is OK. It is really a budget hotel. The room clean, furnished well enough and the bed was not uncomfortable. I would have probably grown a little exhausted with it on a stay of a week or more, but this would be true for any budget hotel and for two nights, it was very good for a night\u2019s rest after sightseeing. The staff, again, was OK. Not overfriendly or helpful, but not rude or inattentive either. The breakfast was included in our rate which, as you guessed, was OK. Nothing spectacular and it is certainly not going to win any critic awards. But the food was fine and I didn\u2019t walk away hungry either. The location is fine. Not very close to the center, but there is a tram stop about 5 minutes away which will take you to Alexanderplatz in about 20 minutes. Obviously, there are going to be nicer and more conveniently located hotels in Berlin. But, for the price, this is a good option. If do not crave luxury and are just looking for a clean hotel that will allow you to see the city without breaking the bank, this might be a very good fit.

The hotel is on the east side of Berlin in an old residential building, which was revamped to become a hotel. This is evident from the huge rooms and big windows.

The breakfast was rich and had great variety. The city center was reachable with a tram that takes you in approximately 25 minutes to Alexander Platz. The stop was at 200 m.

Looks a little derelict on the outside and you see signs on the hotel for a bowling alley which throws you a bit but when we walked inside we were pleasantly surprised. We couldn\u2019t get any other accommodation at short notice as there was an international convention on in Berlin and most hotels were booked out. We were in room 5.3 on the 5th floor. Rooms are a little outdated, but very clean, large inside with a foyer that has a wardrobe and places to hang your jackets and then a separate door into your bedroom which had a table and chairs for 2 people a writing desk a TV with one English speaking channel BBC and a very comfy bed which we both slept well in. Breakfast is included each morning and consisted of scrambled eggs, boiled eggs bacon, breads, pastries, cereals, yoghurt, cold meats, fresh fruit salad, tea, coffee and juices. A very good selection. Parking is also free for your car on the property. The hotel is situated a 3 minute walk to the tram station. Tickets for the tram can be bought at reception. \u20ac2.10 one way or a full day tram pass for \u20ac6.10. All you need to do is catch the M6 tram in and back it is that simple and takes about 10 minutes on the tram to reach Alexander Platz stop. The hotel is a 3 star which could do with a furniture update but we were comfortable and had plenty of room to strtch out. The hotel is very fresh smelling and the housekeeping is very good, no complaints from us. The only real negative is that the rooms do not have air conditioning so you have to leave your window open, but being on a main road produced some noise from traffic. I would recommend this hotel as it was a lot cheaper than hotels in the heart of Berlin and you can get a great price online.", "Date": "July 28, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Roseville, California", "Title": "\u201cComfortable hotel, but a little far from downtown Berlin\u201d", "Author": "gcjones", "ReviewID": "UR69675318", "Content": "We stayed here 2 nights (Jun 16-17, 2010) as part of a tour group.
