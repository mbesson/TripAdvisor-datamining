Taxis are easy to get as the hotel is on the main road. It's a newly built property opened less than 3 years ago, therefore in good condition. Good value for money (if booked in adavnce). Food is very expensive at the hotel and i think they should re-do their prices as many options are nearby. no WI-FI in the room and internet is usually sold seperate and very very expensive. Also if you buy x number of hours, they will expire after x number of hours whether used or not.

Being used to all kinds of Accor hotels from Sofitel to Mercure, and now Ibis, I have to say we did not expect a lot of a buffet breakfast but even so we were surprised by its wide range of choice. We spent all day running around the city (with the hop-on hop-off bus, both its day and its night guided tours are very nice).

The free underground car park is excellent but the reception staff were cold and not as welcoming as other hotels I've experienced in Dubai. The Al Rigga area is convenient for the Deira and Dubai Creek areas and Al Rigga Road itself has many restaurants including an excellent Indian right across the road! The room was small-ish but beautifully clean as was the rest of the hotel which looks as though it was originally intended to be offices/apartments? The bar was small with satellite TV and served expensive drinks in a not-very-friendly environment. The barman provided 'free' popcorn and was cheerful. The free wi-fi in reception was acceptably fast - but it didn't work in the outside seating area. The restaurant for breakfast was chaotic with cheap furniture (a chair broke when I tried to move it, exposing sharp nails) and the food - although theoretically plentiful - wasn't refreshed and replenished as often as necessary. The main breakfast also finished at 10.00am which is early if you're on holiday and staff made it very clear that it was 'finished' by closing a curtain bang on the dot of the advertised time! The a la carte food in the lounge area was over-priced and not well cooked either. We didn't eat there often, but when we did, the main courses (pizza and chicken cordon bleu) was over-cooked to the point of being inedible. As we were in a rush, we did eat it though. The ordered fresh fruit salads comprised chopped apples and small pieces of melon with half a strawberry on top. Very poor and we refused to eat/pay for these. The serving staff then became stroppy and we were cold-shouldered subsequently. Overall, the hotel was good - but try and eat out whenever you can.

Unsafe... Fire !\u201d", "Author": "NightWhispers", "ReviewID": "UR107376356", "Content": "This is one of the strangest hotels I have ever been in. It is huge, spotless, and in a great location. The rooms are clean. That's about all I can say that's good about it. What's a building without service ? Moreso, what's a hotel where at one point your personal safety is put into doubt because a fire alarm went off and no one was there to tell you what to do ? I'll get to that in just a moment... Let me describe my experience from day one. I booked this hotel from the accor hotels website, it had the lowest rate, 161 dirhams per night, as well as a stay 3 pay 2 nights promotion. I thought, what the heck. OK, first glitch, you can't get this promotion unless you pay in advance with your credit card... OK.. Did that, and got the confirmation... Arrived there early morning. No one to help with my stuff (ok, I'll give them that, 161 dirhams, 2 star hotel, can't expect much I suppose)... Entered and gave the receptionist the reservations reference. \"oh, sure, we have the reservation, but I need to charge your credit card.....\" \"but I already paid when I did the booking ?\" \"nope\" .... OK, this went on for about 5 minutes until I just gave up and gave her the card. She took an authorisation... Fair enough. Went up to my room, at a 36C humid temperature, the AC was stuck at 25. Tried to call someone... No answer at reception... Tried again, no answer at reception. Got to work all afternoon in the heat, tried in the early evening, no answer.... This hotel has a placard in the rooms that is proudly displayed at the entrance... \"if for any reason we can't solve your problem within 15 minutes, you'll be our guest...\" the caveat for this is, you actually need to find someone who'll listen to you, which is hard enough when you have 2 receptionists tending 208 rooms. Don't get me wrong, they're polite enough for the most part, but the logistics of this hotel are seriously overwhelmed... I went to sleep that night, with the hot AC. Went down the next day, asked to speak to the manager, the receptionist was checking people in nodded and said ok, please wait a moment.. I did... Guess what happened... The receptionist turned out to be the \"in charge for the day\" which according to my understanding meant that she was the one ultimately responsible for the running of this hotel... OK, I played along and asked her to tend to last night's problem, she denied that happened and tried to convince me I may have dialed the wrong number (!) OK. The issue will be resolved by the time you return this afternoon. To their credit, it was, and my room was cold. Later that night I needed a longer network cable. OK, this time I managed to reach reception, who sent someone up who (literally) did not know what a network cable is. An hour later, I get a call back from the woman who tells me (no network cables, sorry). The next day I tried to take a shower, the mixer was stuck at \"hot\"... Another attempt to reach reception failed. I was just too frustrated at this point to bother anymore. I went down and asked to confirm my bill and the receptionist tried to confuse me with some talk about the numbers being wrong and asked for my reservation. I sent it to her and she told me again the numbers were wrong and that the calculation was different. At this point I was fed up and went up to sleep at what was thankfully supposed to be my last night there.Through the banging and yelling in the hall outside, I fell asleep at midnight . At 2:45 am the FIRE alarm went off.... \"we are investigating a potential fire, please stand by...\" or something like that the automated announcement went... for a full half hour (at least). I stood in the hallway with the other guests, all of us obviously too confused since no one at the hotel came up to tell us what to do .... and do you think anyone managed to get through to reception ? nope... What happened at the end of the half hour ? the announcement simply stopped... No notice, nothing, just like that... Of course that meant I had no more sleep for the rest of the night, when I went down in the morning, I asked what had happened. Guess what, there WAS a small fire on the third floor of the hotel... No one told us anything. I tried to follow up about the promotion and was given the runaround, I tried to speak to the manager and got some guy who was on duty, basically to tell me \"nothing he would do\". I told him I was an unsatisfied customer, at the treatment, mentioned the problems I had encountered, and he just shrugged it off like it was the most normal thing in the world. This hotel gets two stars. The staff, I hope Ibis decides to retrain. As for the manager that decided to tell me off because I told him I didn't want to hear the \"form reply\" that \"they're going to take it into consideration and under advisement\". I've been in customer service for a long time. Let me assure you that in every company I have been in, customer safety comes first, then their satisfaction. It's a key to return business. If Ibis does decide to reply to this review, please avoid the form reply of \"taking suggestions into consideration\".", "Date": "May 8, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "jakarta", "Title": "\u201cAverage compare to other Ibis Hotel i'd ever stayed\u201d", "Author": "Posted by an Accorhotels.com traveler", "ReviewID": "UR106787470", "Content": "unlike other ibis hotel in my home country, no service during check in, you have to carry your own bags. the check in process is quick. the location is superb, near to mall, food and public transport. one bad impression, a guy at the front office - without name badge that I met in the afternoon at 23 April 2011, in my opinion, does not assist me properly with the information about the shuttle to deira city center.

We stopped in Dubai just for curiosity while returning to Europe from Singapore and this hotel was (and is) really a very pleasant and comfortable option. Fortunately we didn't have any problem at all. The staff was very nice and they attended us correctly and professionally. Our room was very clean, very tidy and cleaned every day. In fact the whole hotel was very clean, so it seems that the cleaning staff does an excellent job. Also the personnel at the reception was correct and helpful. Our twin room was spacious, modern and very well equipped -it obviously had air-conditioning, while windows could not be opened. The room price we paid didn't include breakfast but we happily paid the extra cost of the breakfast because it was superb. In other words: I'm the kind of person who loves to start the day with a good and powerful breakfast and I can confirm that this hotel provides this and more (I would have exploded if I had eaten everything the breakfast buffet offered). In line with the hotel's restaurant, let me explain as well that one evening we had dinner at the hotel and the food quality and quantity were also very good. Finally let's say something about the location. In the first place, it is relatively close to the airport (if there are no traffic jams, a taxi will take you there in only 15 minutes) which can be also reached by metro (the new Al Rigga metro station is just a 5-7 minutes walk from the hotel). The area is also safe (in fact it seems that Dubai is, in general, a very safe place) and there are quite a lot of restaurants in the same street, where it is possible to have good and reasonable meals. My conclusion is that if I ever visit Dubai again and this hotel maintains its service level and price, then this will be my sleeping option.", "Date": "April 15, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Boston, Massachusetts", "Title": "\u201cGood Ibis\u201d", "Author": "Waterfall84", "ReviewID": "UR103689789", "Content": "Brand new Ibis.
