Traveled to Puerto Rico on business last week and needed to spend one night in a hotel in San Juan close to the airport. Sure, it was cheap, but you get what you pay for. Upon entering the lobby the stench was overwhelming...maybe the hotel was experiencing sewer problems? I don't know, but my co-worker and I both gagged. The ladies at the front desk were very pleasant and helpful, really the brightest spot in the hotel experience. Check-in was easy and quick. Onto the room---I think the Brady Bunch probably stayed in this hotel at some point. Brown, harvest gold, and orange!! Are you serious? The bedspread and matching curtains were nylon. The carpet was worn and frayed. The bathroom was by far the most dated part of the room. There was a bottle opener on the back of the bathroom door! My colleague is younger then me and didn't even know what it was when I asked him if he had seen it. The glaze in the tub was worn off where one would stand to take a shower, and that was all one would be doing because the handle on the drain was MISSING! To avoid re-glazing the tub a rubber bath mat had been placed over the area. I watched paint chips float around my feet while I was in the shower, as the drain in the tub was very, very slow. No washcloths and no hand towels. I would add that the room was clean and smelled okay. The bed was comfortable and the A/C worked well. If you are looking for a cheap hotel close to the airport this is your place. I personally would never stay here again and I certainly will not listen to the guy that 'recommended' this hotel again!", "Date": "April 23, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Sleep Quality": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Payson, Utah", "Title": "\u201cSick!\u201d", "Author": "Annie571", "ReviewID": "UR126460554", "Content": "This hotel was like a scary movie that had come to life.

The customer service was a joke, on the counter in the bathroom was a sign that said, Oops, forgot something, just call us and we can help. Well, we needed a toothbrush and so we called and asked if they had a toothbrush and they just said \"no\" like we were crazy. Then we asked if they had a razor and they person said, \"where the hell is your stuff\"! My son just kinda laughed and then explained that the sign said you could get this stuff if you need it.

Once there, we found that it was at a good location across from the beach. I chose this hotel because it was close to the airport, had parking available at a $6.96 daily charge, and included a continental breakfast. Upon entering the hotel, we found an attractive lobby and were greeted by a very helpful staff member. While checking in, I mentioned to my husband that I was thirsty, and the hotel staff member immediately offered me a bottle of water. Although we didn't have time to use the pool, it looked very nice. The room was small, nicely appointed, but it did have a slight odor. The elevator is very small and slow. The one thing that was disappointing was the continental breakfast. This hotel was a bit more expensive then some of the others that I looked at, but I thought that having breakfast available to us would save us some time in the morning. It was probably the worst continental breakfast that I have ever seen at a hotel. We got to the breakfast between 8:30 and 9:00, and the fruit was gone, and didn't get refilled. What was left, had no taste at all. The coffee cups must have been the smallest that they could buy. I couldn't find water for tea and had to ask for it. They did have orange juice, and a few pastries and muffins, but we just ended up having toast with jelly as it seemed to be the best from the choices available.", "Date": "March 18, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "2", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "West Windsor, NJ", "Title": "\u201cFine for a quick stopover\u201d", "Author": "N&YinNJ", "ReviewID": "UR125803713", "Content": "First impressions mean alot so when you encounter that musty, moldy smell in the foyer... well...Check in staff very helpful and it's treat to see the outdoor pool right off the main foyer.

Tiny window, not so much light but we weren't there to hang out in the room anyway. Bathroom OK. Didn't need to use the AC because the evenings were cool enough - just left the window open a crack.

We were given a room on the 3rd floor, overlooking the street/ocean. Room had a fridge, which we used to house bottled water, which was great. However, the fridge was still full from the last guests food items and expired milk (ick!), which we had to clean out ourselves in order to utilize the fridge. Rooms are carpeted, which is a surprise, as I thought it would be easier for a hotel across the street from a beach to clean tracked-in sand with tile floors. Towels were clean, but sparse, with only 2-3 bath towels, 1 hand towel and 1 wash cloth per day for the room. Basics were provided for the bathroom (shampoo, conditioner, lotion, and sometimes mouthwash). Sheets were clean but thin. Bed was somewhat comfy. Maid kept the bathtub clean each day (free of all the hair, sand, etc). Was pretty much what I expected staying at an older HoJo. I would even compare the room quality to the Coqui Inn across the highway from this hotel (I've stayed there too). What sets this HoJo apart are the staff (beyond friendly), the location (right across from the beach access!), and the breakfast. Breakfast consisted of hot oatmeal, fruit, various cereals, toast (white or wheat, with butter or jelly), pastries, muffins, OJ, apple juice, water, milk, tea and coffee. Would I rather have a big pancake breakfast? Sure. But for free, I am not going to complain. Be sure to bring a dollar or two to tip the waitstaff in the morning, as they bust their butt to try to keep the food stocked and tables clean. Note that the later in the morning you go to breakfast, the less likely you are to find everything in stock. There are multiple reasons why it is great to have your hotel so close to the beach: You spend less time walking and more time enjoying the sun; you can run inside if you forgot something, have to go to the bathroom, or if a sudden torrential downpour occurrs outside; and you are close to all of the other touristy bars, restaurants, and casinos without paying an arm and a leg for a room at those casino hotels. Was it a luxurious hotel? No, of course not. But if all you are looking for is a hotel right across the street from the beach to sleep and shower in, with the added bonus of a free breakfast, at a reasonable rate, consider this one. We bought this hotel reservation as part of a vacation package through one of the discount websites (William Shatner anyone?), so be aware that the hotel charged us an additonal amount for taxes when we checked in, so take that into consideration when price comparing.", "Date": "February 2, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Sleep Quality": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Brooklyn, New York", "Title": "\u201cwatch what room you are assigned\u201d", "Author": "BrooklynBoider", "ReviewID": "UR123880309", "Content": "I stayed there twice- at the beginning and at the end of a group tour.The first time was on an upper floor (8th)and the room was decent with a view of the ocean.The second time we were on the 4th floor - Rm 409.

However, the breakfast area is large and amazing; it's on the top floor with all-glass walls and a gorgeous ocean view. Our room came with a fridge and a microwave (upon request) which was quite helpful for an extended stay. The front desk staff were courteous and helpful; however room service and housekeeping requests was very slow whenever we called for something. Not sure if this was because we were on the highest floor. Faccio Pizza in the hotel has great italian food; we tried the pasta dishes one night and they also have great pizzas which seemed popular. The Isla Verde area seemed ok during the day but cops were pretty prevalent on isle verde avenue at night. It seemed safe but it just made us wonder if it was safe to walk the streets esp. at night.

Also tried Faccio Pizza on the lobby level, enjoying a huge calzone to go.

Also ate good mofongo with chicken at the Ruben's, Cuban joint next door. They share the HoJo parking lot. Clean, good, inexpensive. Definitely walk down to the Metropole restaurant for the best stuffed cornish hen. It's about a 12 minute easy walk to the right from the hotel, after the cockfight arena (supplier of the cornish hens???). Same staff there for at least 20 years.

The free breakfast in the morning is a fine cold breakfast type. The restaurant is up on the 10th floor so the views are great. The hotel is a 10 cab ride (plus 1 dollar per bag) from the airport and 20 to the pier. The hotel is right across the road (and a 50 foot path) from the beach which was a mandatory thing for us. We are beach people and were at the beach as quickly as we could. The beach there (isla verde) is a great beach. No vendors pushing you stuff. Nice water for playing in (good for body surfing and kite boarding, but surfing ). The sand is great for the kids to build castles in and easy on the feet. It is also cleaned daily. The hotel is conviently located on a strip with lots to eat. If you are able.. when checking in, book a room on the 5th floor. The 5th floor rooms have balconies. The corners (room 512) has a balcony that is easily 3 times the size of the room itself. There are lounge chairs and everything already there.

We stayed 5 nights in the hotel on the fourth floor. Room was very spacious but the bathroom was tiny. Not sure why they couldn't have dedicated a little more space to the bathrooms. The lobby was nice enough, the staff there very friendly and helpful. Elevators are very flaky. From the fourth floor, trying to call the elevator was difficult. If the elevator was on a higher floor, the elevator would only descend to the fifth floor and get stuck. If you wanted to get to the fourth floor from the upper floor, it would stop at the fifth floor. You'd have to press 5 to open the doors, then press 4 to start moving again. Weird. The service elevator was the next option but it was also very slow. Wi-fi worked for the first couple of days and then didn't work the rest of our time there unless you went to the lobby. The breakfast experience is one that I wish never to repeat. The food was what you'd expect from a cheap continental breakfast, so no surprises there. The tables all had crumbs on them, some had plates and dishes left on them. We ate there on our first morning and last morning. The last morning a lady working there named Lily was extremely rude and in a loud, condescending and almost shouting tone, instructed everybody that they were responsible for cleaning there own tables (previous diners there had not done so). She said that we were responsible for cleaning our own tables so that they could continue to bring out the food. This was in a very demeaning tone. Quite shocking really. Especially considering everybody in there was still eating and any previous culprits that had not cleaned their own tables were not there so could not be on the receiving end of that rant. It wasn't that she was just having a bad day either, because on the first morning we ate breakfast there, we observed her belittling her subordinates in front of the guests.

I really wanted to stay at these four or five star hotels, but it wasnt in my budget. I probably had the money for it at the time but then I would not have enough spending money for this trip. I rather have more spending money for the trip than to spend the extra money for a hotel room that I'm only going to be sleeping in for few hours. So, this hotel caught my eye even though it had mix reviews. At first, I was feeling that it was not my first choice. Then, I re read the reviews over and over and re read other hotel reviews as well. I decided to go with this hotel. I am so glad that I chose this hotel. When I first arrived at the hotel, I was already expecting a dark dungeon with roaches and other bugs welcoming my arrival. Actually, the room was slightly small but very clean. It had two double beds that were hard as a rock when you first lay on it. It was so hard that you can spin on your head like your breakdancing on cement. When I slept on the bed, it felt comfortable. I dont know if my spouse and I were so tired because of lack of sleep from partying late every night. The beds didnt feel so bad after all. The bathroom was kind of small but i dont mind it anyways. I like my bathroom time as private time. They have a way better showerhead than the one I have in my house. You can switch it to different modes like massage, rain shower, and other functions which i have no idea what they are for. It like your garden hose with that multifunction head like horizonal and vertical. Our room had a small fridge, microwave and coffeemaker. It was convienent especially it you have leftovers from takeouts. You can always reheat it and enjoy just like it was brought to you from the restaurant. The coffee they offer is sooo easy to make and so delicious. The only thing is that you have quite a distance to a supermarket. You can go to walgreens or a small c-store accross the street from walgreens to get some microwavable food. I did have a partial ocean view which I didnt care for. The best part of it is that the hotel is right accross the street from the beach. Its a small walkway. You can miss it if you dont look right. The enterance is right accross the street from hotel.There is a pool but I never utilized it cause THE BEACH IS ACCROSS THE STREET... WALKING DISTANCE!! So take advantage! Plus go the beach at night. its not dangerous like i thought it was. It was romantic and relaxing. Dont worry you will see other couples as well.There is construction going on the streets. Dont worry about noise. They dont work weekends and looks like they only work only a few hours a day. Just becareful and watch your step when you are walking down the isla verde avenue. The streets are undone and you can fall or trip. I received free continintal breakfast vouchers but I never used them. I rather eat the traditional puerto rican food. There is a restaurant next door from hotel called Los Pinos. It looks ugly and dirty but it is sooo good and inexpensive. The average plate is about $8 to $15. The sandwiches averaged $5 to $7. The alcoholic drinks averaged $2 to $4.It was worth it. If you wanna inexpensive alcoholic drinks. Go to local bars outside of hotels. Overall, this trip experience was great. It was not a let down. The hotel was worth the money. I had no problems with the employees or room. Great customer service. If you need to ask advice about puerto rico of what or where to go, ask the front desk. They are good with that kind of stuff. To the reader, I wish you well on your decision and have fun on the trip.

I figured that HoJo would be a safe bet because it's a chain which I thought would have consistent standards of cleanliness. I was wrong. First off, when we arrived at the hotel on Saturday evening, there was one man working the front desk and phones. Four people were waiting in line to check in and it took him a good 45 minutes to get through that group of people. The whole time he's answering phones and trying to check people in, his manager is just standing there watching him instead of jumping in and helping. When we finally got our keys the hotel elevators took FOREVER. I mean it was crazy how long you would wait to get into one of those death traps. Unfortunately, the room didn't get much better than that. The hotel is definitely a late 70's/early 80's building that is desperate need of a renovation. I can tolerate ugly decor, but the rooms just were dirty. There were major rust stains all in the shower, the carpet was dirty and it just looked like a lot of band-aid repairs were done to fix problems. Like if you looked at the corners of the bathtubs and sinks you could see large chunks of miscolored caulking added to fix problems. Also, the bathroom was really dark with this one spooky flourescent light that made you feel like you were in the Bates motel. Breakfast wasn't much better. They give you complimentary continental breakfast coupons when you check in. You eat on the top level of the hotel where I thought there would just be a little buffet table with some danishes and milk. But, you sit down, restaurant style and are given a breakfast menu. Just remember that this is not included in the free continental breakfast. Those meals cost more, however you can use your free vouchers for $2 off one of those other breakfast entrees. In the end, one night was more than enough for me at the HoJo. I'm sure if you're partying and want a cheaper place to stay across the street from the beach you may not mind.

The carpeting had huge black stains all over it and carpeting was missing in some areas of the room. Closet door was broken. Balcony had garbage all over it-old ciggarette packs and butts etc, and the cement floor had black dirt all over it.

The tour was terrible. He told us we were going to hike the Big Tree and El Yunque trails, and take us to see El Morro and other sites in Old San Juan because we couldn't go to the Bacardi Factory. Well, we didn't hike the trails he promised, we hiked La Mina trails instead. And he didn't give us a tour of anything in Old San Juan, he dropped us off at the ferry in Catano and told us to take the ferry to Old San Juan and have a good time. Then he charged us $65 dollars instead of the $60 we were told when we booked. Lunch was not included. Nothing else was included either- no water, ponchos, sunscreen, bug spray etc, like they are on other cheaper tours. We were really dissatified. I would never do another tour with him.

Also, we were on Isla Verde beach at dusk and we got harrassed by some guys saying sexual things to us. I didn't feel safe in Isla Verde at all. Later at night we walked to a casino in the Embassy Suites about three blocks away and were harrassed again by some disgusting drunk guy on the street.

Never stay on the 2nd floor unless you like to be woken up every fifteen minutes by the hum and regurgitation of the ice machine next door.

I requested to be moved, which I was by the helpful, although somewhat clueless staff. It took all day, then they had the problem of giving the room away.

We paid (AAA) 130 a night (+ $20 taxes). We had room 511. Recommended for types who only want their hotel for bedtime, like being close to the beach and are realistic about the place. The good 1. Five minutes drive to the airport, without the airport sounds (the Courtyard (100$ more a night), Ritz and Hampton Inn (90$ more a night) all border the airport). I am sure the rooms are sound proof, but when you are outside you will hear the jets taking off. 2. Right across from the beach (although there are apartments blocking much of the view). The Hampton Inn (which does have a nicer setting), Embassy and the Holiday Inn are a couple of blocks away. 3. The best part of Isla Verde beach. Maybe the conditions change over time, but that part was nicer than the part the InterC, ESJ Towers and El San Juan front, which are all together (and the beach one would walk to from the Hampton Inn and others). The Courtyard and Ritz (smooth sand, imported?) are on a slightly different beach. The Courtyard is the last building for a long while, which is nice as it abuts a public beach, though there are a few permanent tents there(?). We liked that beach and watched the planes take off as we floated in the water. 4. There is a shower by the pool. On the last day we had a late flight out, so we left our luggage at the desk, returned at 4, swam in the pool (nice area, not big), showered there, got our bags and changed and caught the outrageously expensive taxi for the airport. 5. The window was pretty sound proof, but the hotel is right on top of the main drag so probably a bit noiser than others. The So-so It is an older building and that was the source of the not so good. 1. Old floor tiles (new wall tiles/hair drier/fixtures) and the caulking going. 2. The room itself had the sort of clean but you are in a tropical place feel. A bit dark. 3. We also had noisy young-uns coming in late from partying. 4. It is on the main drag, so you will feel like you are more in a city than at a resort. 5. The room didnt have a safe, but I would recommend leaving valuable at the front desk. 6. In absolute terms, it was not cheap, but relative to the prices of other hotels, it was. Comments on comments others had 1. No problems with wait time on the elevators There are two. 2. Yes, the window would worry me if I had a child. 3. We had the usual amount of coffee in our room and there is a fridge. We didnt even bother trying the continental breakfast. 4.

Although our flight was 3 hours late, check in was a breeze.

Here's the selling point, the beach is literally right across the street from the hotel!!! Isla Verde beach which everyone says is much nicer than the other 2 popular San Juan beaches, Condado Beach & Ocean Park is impeccably clean & gorgeous. Its full of tourists & people who live in the beach front condos. Now for the food. The hotel only serves a croissant & coffee for breakfast so you should walk a few blocks down towards a mini mall that's right across the street from the Intercontinental Hotel to have breakfast at this great little diner where breakfast is delish for like $2.99(including coffee). The hotel beds are very comfortable & the rooms all have satellite TV which pick up all the US channels. The hotel has a small art gallery & 2 restaurants, both way too pricey. Go to the Oyster Bar a couple of blocks down for delicious seafood & even tastier drinks, we loved the Oyster Bar. They have live bands some nights & there's dancing till 4am. For casino lovers, you must visit the Wyndham El San Juan Hotel, the most beautiful casino & lobby area I have ever seen, very swanky so dress your best. And lastly no visit to Puerto Rico is complete without a visit to Old San Juan(a 45 minute bus ride from Isla Verde) with it's cobble stoned streets, art galleries, grand forts & castles, out door cafes & award winning restaurants, it is a must. You can just sit by the cruise ship port & sip on a cup of spanish coffee while taking in the gorgeous sunset. Loved loved loved Old San Juan.

The hotel was clean, the staff was very friendly and gave me pleanty of advice on how to get to different sites (especially the front desk clerk Maribel, she was very helpful). The room was quite comfortable, it had a king size bed, cable TV (which included channels from NYC and other American cities), a refrigerator, hairdryer, iron/ironing board, desk. I stayed on the 8th floor so I did not really here too much noise at night like some of the other guests complained about in these reviews. The pool area was clean and well kept, although the water in the pool was very cold. The fitness was not great at all, it probably had 4 different machines in there (treadmill, bike, and some weights). The hotel was located in a great spot, it was right accross the street from the beach which some of the other hotels are not (like the Embassy Suites, the Hampton Inn & the Holiday Inn). The hotel was also located near a food mall which included some of the common fast food restaurants (BK, Taco Bell, KFC, Pizza Hut) and also a few local restaurants (PR restaurant, Chinese and a Mexican restaurant). I have to say though I was very dissapointed that I did not find too many restaurants serving typical PR food. It was also close to a Walgreen's, two banks, a supermarket and a CyberNet Cafe. The hotel also offers several tours, I took the one for El Yunque and had a great time. I was able to take public transportation to Old San Juan.

My recommendation is stay her 1 night pre cruise only, check in and then go out across the street for a cocktail or two, walk on the beach, walk into town to one of the best PR restaurants in the strip mall about 10 blocks to the right upon hotel exit. Retire early after a satisfying meal to rest up for the cruise. Check out around 10:30 am and head for the cruise port.

We booked our room after a lot of research with other travelers, in books, and online. Our basic requirements were safety, cleanliness, affordability (<$150/night), beach access, and a pool. Here's how it stacked up: 1) Safety - I felt very safe at all times inside of the hotel, though I wouldn't recommend a woman wandering around any hotel by herself. Outside of the hotel, the Isla Verde section of San Juan/Carolina felt very safe during the day. My girlfriend and I walked around after dark, but always as a pair. As another reviewer mentioned, the police presence is significant. 2) Cleanliness - The hotel is very clean, especially the lobby and common area. The rooms and hallways were a bit rundown, but nothing glaring. The housekeeping staff kept our room in great shape, and they were incredibly good about fixing up our room while we were out on the beach. Not once did they knock while we were in the room. It was a pleasant surprise to come back to a tidy room and fresh towels each afternoon! Overall, the hotel was clean but slightly less pristine (i.e. standard-issue, budget hotel sparkle) than a Howard Johnson's in the continental U.S. 3) Affordability - We paid either $110 or $115 per night. Remember that they will stick you with heavy taxes above and beyond the stated rate. We got a few dollars off of the nightly Internet-advertised rate by calling and inquiring. We saw some of the slightly less expensive motels while we were there, and they looked dismal. However, if you want a step up from the HoJo, be prepared to shell out big bucks. There's not a lot of middle ground. 4) Beach access - This is a selling point. It takes less than a minute to walk from the hotel to the beach. The access alley was not dirty, contrary to a few other reviews. Even on busy days, the traffic on the street prevents you from crossing for mere seconds. The beach itself has clean sand and turquoise water. In late December, the water was fairly warm and clear. Not a lot of seaweed or other aquatic life visible. Christmas is a peak tourist time in San Juan, but the beach was never crowded. 5) The pool is lovely. It was immaculately clean and nearly always empty. It only reaches 4.5 feet in depth and is quite small, so not good for divers or lap swimmers. The only issue was that it broke for one day of our stay. However, they had it fixed within 24 hours. The ice cream parlor is now closed. They are adding a bar and music club in its place, so it's currently under renovations. That was a disappointment. If you're used to Holiday Inns, Sheratons, and Radissons on the mainland, you may find this Howard Johnson to be a bit on the lackluster side. Depends on whether you find a departure from corporate hotel chain monotony to be refreshing or risky. I felt like the HoJo was a good home base from which to explore the city and the beach. If you want to sip an umbrella drink in a fancy pool, go down the street to the luxurious Intercontinental. If you want a historical and unique hotel surrounded by shopping and dining, try El Convento in Old San Juan. (The bus to Old San Juan, by the way, picks you up for 25 cents across from the HoJo. It's a bit crowded and pick-ups aren't terribly frequent, but it's a great deal!) Food recommendations: -Steak and Co. restaurant has fantastic service and reasonably priced appetizers that doubled as an early dinner for us. -Golden Bagel Bakery has good variety for breakfast and lunch. Bagels aren't great, but the omelettes [and service] were. -The food at Ambrosia in Old San Juan was delicious, but the service was horrible. -We had a passable dinner at the Bohio, across from the Intercontinental. Kind of a glorified Italian joint with some good Latin options. -The ambience at the Intercontinental's outdoor cafe was great. We had dinner on a deck over the beach. Portions are huge! -Because rooms at the HoJo have fridges, we went to one of the two nearby grocery stores and bought some staple foods.

At first we booked a fancy hotel in the condado area only to hear that it was away from everything and that we would have to take a cab every day. So in the end even with the deal i got it was not cost efficient. A little more research and my sister found HJ. We decided that to be honest we were not going to be spending much time in the room anyway so why should we get a fancy room. It was 101 the first park of our vacation over the weekend and then 112 the second part of our vacation the weekend as well. The rooms were not huge but not small either. We got a room with 2 beds and the first 2 nights had a cot that I must say was not the most comfortable thing, u felt the springs, but cots are not meant to be cozy. The front desk staff was neither nice nor nasty. We met a hotel manager and he was really nice. And this hotel is safe, the only way you can get upstairs is by having a keycard that u must swipe in hte elevator and will only let u press the floor for which the key corisponds to.(new York hotels should think about that) We didnt bother trying the restaurant on the top floor, too expensive for us and italian food in puerto rico.
