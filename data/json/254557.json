We booked a room last July, 2011 for a stay in Sep. Our plans changed and I cancelled the reservation more than 4 weeks before the trip. They charged us the USD176 deposit anyway. I emailed them multiple times and even called several times and was promised that it would be corrected, but nothing was done. Finally, I disputed the charge through MasterCard. Several months later it was corrected (I thought). Then they charged me again! Only after another dispute was it corrected. They would not quit however and charged me a third time!! I am going through the dispute process for what I hope will be the final time. I am fed up with what I hope is their sheer incompetence rather than dishonesty.

My room was always tidied up and refreshed each day and the buffet breakfast was a pleasant surprise with fresh fruit, all kinds of cereal and muesli, yogurt, hot drinks, juices and a family friend B&B, homey type of setting which is conducive towards meeting some interesting people who are also staying at Blades. If you want to meet others, that's fine. If you want to dine in silence, that is totally acceptable, too.

I did not receive such and am compelled to make sure that the truth be known. This hotel made the Rick Steve's list and I can not imagine how. It makes me wonder if Rick is being paid by the hotels to make recommendations. We reserved a triple room that literally the beds extended from wall to wall and you had to walk sideways to get to the very small area where you had to pack suitcases on top of one another so they would fit. When we walked in we smelled a peculiar odor and did not immediately identify. Having just flown all night we each wanted a shower and to take a walk through London. The bathroom was so small you could sit on the toilet and reach the shower. The shower kept filling up with water as the drain did not work and we had to lather, turn the water off and wait for it to drain, then rinse, turn the water off, ad infinity... The next day we had no hot water at all!!! I went to speak to the inn keeper and she said that the hot water is cut off at 11am and she would turn on but it takes 2 hrs to heat up. We went without showering. I also informed her at that time that we could not get the shower to drain, she said it was good to know these things and she would call a plumber. I also informed her that we could not use the lamp on the nightsdtand because we realized that the electrical outlet was busted to pieces and was a fire hazard. She tried to give me an extension cord so we could use the single outlet that appeared intact. That evening I went to the small general area in the hotel so I could read while my husband and son watched tv. Not to my surprise the lamps did not work so I had to bring the lamp from my room to the general area so I could read. The final day, we got up early, took showers, and I accidently flooded the bathroom. I thought I had determined how much water I could have floating in the bottom of the shower and still open the door and I misjudged. Some water came out and I had to clean everything up with towels. The inn keeper was very upset with me. Lastly, my son and I are now very sick as we continue our journeys through Europe. We figured out what the smell probably was: MOLD.

We ended up at the wrong theater -- the Old Vic, instead of at the West End across the river. Fortunately, the folks at the box office re-directed us. That cost us another cab ride and a delayed seating. Lack of wi-fi made booking dinner reservations difficult and meant we were unable to check and re-confirm our flight to Amsterdam, so we spent 4 precious vacation hours in an airport unnecessarily. Neither our soap nor our towels were refreshed after 3 days. We had to ask for clean towels. We bought our own soap at Boots. The room was smallish but to be expected in London, and we knew in advance there was no AC; however, the lack of a fan to provide a bit of breeze is almost unconscionable. The location on Belgrave Road is terrific. Luckily, there are many other hotels and B&Bs just steps away that you can choose.

The room is done up nicely for a budget hotel and has a traditional English feel with the chinz drapes. Another reviewer mentioned the lack of closet, but the closet rod is in a open area like the bay of a bay window. I thought the open space made the small room feel bigger, and I liked the tin ceiling. I truly feel that, other than gaining more space, the hotel is at its best.", "Date": "June 10, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "3", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "TX", "Title": "\u201cThe Blades is the \"Cutting Edge\"\u201d", "Author": "haygirl16", "ReviewID": "UR16626797", "Content": "Cute, little hotel.

It lacks elevators and some other modernisation as it a late Victorian house converted to a hotel but it is a really clean and friendly with a brilliant location. While were there there was the royal State Opening of Parliament and the hotel manager, Kevin, took all the guests to a great spot on the route of the Queen's procession to Westminster - a sensational day. Our room was a moderate size and the breakfast was a time to plan the day with advice been given on theatres and places to visit.

The sheets and towels were not changed everyday but every 3 days. So if you stay there for 3 nights, you'll just get fresh towels on the first day. The breakfast was ok but pretty basic. As the reviews said, the manager entertain the guests every morning during breakfaster; it was nice, but we don't pay 100 just for jokes. The hotel is at a decent location, which is very near to the Pimlico station on the Victoria line.

We received a warm welcome from the Staff, who where friendly and helpful throughout our stay. The rooms were very clean along with the bedding and the En-suite Showeroom. The room we had (1st floor) was a good size in relation to the price paid, it gave you enough room to move about without falling over each other. The En-suite Showeroom was all you needed and worked for us, however was very small and could be a challenge for above average to large sized people! The Breakfast was good with a selection of different cereals, breads cold meats and cheese etc. The only thing we felt missing that we like to see in a continental breakfast would be some croissants / fresh pastries, otherwise it was good! In relation to the prices of other hotels we looked at in London this hotel was good value for money, clean, with good transport links to the rest of the city, we would happily stay here again!!", "Date": "March 13, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "3", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Memphis, TN", "Title": "\u201cClean, convenient and friendly\u201d", "Author": "RRRinMemphis", "ReviewID": "UR6310520", "Content": "We received a warm and helpful reception from the manager.
