We travel to San Diego often and decided to try a hotel away from the downtown area. The Sorrento area is just minutes away from downtown San Diego, but is also close to Torrey Pines and La Jolla. We were happy with our choice. The rooms were clean, the staff was nice, and even though our room faced Lusk Street, it was very quiet. Breakfast was the usual Holiday Inn Express fare. The pool was kind of small, but the kids using it seemed to be having lots of fun! My only complaint about our room on the fourth floor was that we couldn't open the window. This necessitated turning on the air conditioning unit, which was noisy. Also, the chair in the \"business area\" needs to be replaced. It's like sitting in a hole! One of our favorite excursions while visiting San Diego was a visit to the wineries in Temecula, which we reached via Highway 78, traveling through the little town of Ramona, famous for avocado and citrus orchards, wine grape production, and the most delicious cinnamon rolls I ever eaten at The Ramona Cafe. If you love visiting gardens, you must see the San Diego Botanical Garden, located in Encinitas. It's a very restful garden with lovely California native plants, magnificent palms, and huge bamboo groves. For the kids there's a large interactive children's garden that's fun for adults too.", "Date": "March 29, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Redmond, Oregon", "Title": "\u201cWindows Wont Open\u201d", "Author": "longball44", "ReviewID": "UR126649401", "Content": "My wife and I stayed here five days in March 2012. One problem was that, for the first time in our hotel/motel experiences, we could not open a window to get fresh air. Yes having the AC on all the time drowns out any road or freeway noise, but after awhile it would be nice to be able to get some fresh air without having to take the elevator down and run outside. No matter what floor you are on, most hotels have their windows set you can open them, at least, three or four inches. We went next door to Country Inn & Suites By Carlson and found the same thing, top floor windows that wouldn't open at all. Having a Chili's restaurant directly across from the hotel was a plus for us. We were able to order online and, within minutes, walk over a pick up our dinner at the Chili's To Go door. During the week there was very few folks at breakfast, but come the weekend there were so many people and families having eating that they there was no tables available and they kept running out of food. Even though there were signs that said \"Trays Available\" the staff told me \"No, there are no trays.\" We thought, if there were trays you could, at least, snag some breakfast and take it back up to your room. Not the case here. Hotel doors are heavy and will slam shut if you let them. Please think about the other guests and make sure your door closes quietly when you enter or exit.

The rooms are clean and comfortable. The breakfast is unbeatable, and the employees are probably the nicest people of any hotel I have stayed in before. I'll keep coming back. My only comment (and I've seen this in other Holiday Inns) is the toilet paper. I don't think anyone who builds these hotels has ever sat down and used the toilet. If they had, they would hate it. You have to be a contortionist to be able to reach the toilet paper behind you when you are done. To make it worse, there is this stupid cosmetic metal shield that hangs over the roll which is supposed to look nice. The only problem is that it rips every single sheet of toilet paper one at a time because the toilet paper is thin... So by the time I am done going, my wrist, back and neck all hurt from trying to reach around and tear off one sheet at a time. Seriously, I am surprised that guests haven't tried to rip the thing off. I tried to put it behind the roll, but it didn't work. What's funny is that I asked other people at breakfast, and they all agreed and said the same thing. I just don't think anyone has thought to mention it before.

Big mistake! There were a bunch of teen-aged girl basketball players staying here for a tournament in town. The whole time we were there, both day and night, the girls (and their chaperones/mothers too, some help they were) were going back and forth between their multiple rooms and making a lot of noise in the hallways. All of them closed their security bars (the little levers on the upper parts of their doors) with their doors open so that when their doors would swing shut, they would hit the security bars instead of latching. No big deal, except that every time one of the relatively-heavy doors was let go, it hit the bar and made a loud banging noise. This went on with minimal pauses in between bangs for most of the night and the whole time we were in the room during the days we were there. I called down to the front desk and asked them to please do something about it as we were very tired and needed to get some sleep. The clerk was very nice and said he would take care of it, but nothing changed. I finally asked one of the mothers to please quiet down, but she just stared back at me and kept on with the noisiness. The message the hotel sent by allowing this behavior to continue uninterrupted is that all other guests are at the mercy of the behavior of the worst-behaved guests, whoever they might be. Another, smaller inconvenience was that one of the lights was burned out in the bathroom. It made it so dim in there, I couldn't really see well enough to do normal grooming in the bathroom. On our way out the front door after our first night there, I asked the very nice clerk at the front desk to please have someone replace the burned out bulb. He said he would take care of it, but it was still burned out as of when we checked out of the hotel the next day. When I first asked about it, he said something about not knowing whether they had any light bulbs on hand (???!). When he saw us the next day, he asked whether we had been given the bulb he found for us. I said no, and he expressed disbelief that the people to whom he had given the bulb hadn't given it to me. It's hard for me to understand why they didn't just change the light bulb. That seems to me like just a normal part of room maintenance. The bottom line for me is that in spite of their very cheerful and pleasant attitudes, the people at the front desk were unable to provide assistance with respect to these two issues. I did receive prompt help when I needed to log into their computer to print my boarding pass the morning we checked out, which I appreciated. It would have been nice if we could have had a couple of nights' sleep and could have relaxed a bit during the day instead of leaving feeling tense and sleep-deprived.", "Date": "July 25, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "California", "Title": "\u201cFound this hotel on a discount site...\u201d", "Author": "hppygilmore", "ReviewID": "UR71202605", "Content": "Found this hotel on a discount site.

That is why it is difficult for me to write such a negative review. RESERVATIONS: Booked 2 rooms on-line using my Priority Club membership. Quick and easy. Requested adjoining rooms for our 2 day stay. ARRIVAL: Upon our late Friday night arrival, we were greeted by a friendly, if not lonely and overworked young man. When he told us our rooms were on different floors, I asked him if he could please put my parents and us next to one another or at least on the same floor. He advised us that the hotel had been sold out for the weekend and there were no more rooms available. My first impression of the hotel was that it looked as if HI had purchased the property from another hotel chain as it didn't seem to have the layout of the newer HI hotels. ROOMS: My parents were in a king room on the 2nd floor. My hubby, teenaged daughter and I were in a 2 queen 4th floor room. We had a room at the very end of the hallway. The minute we stepped into our room, we knew things weren't \"right.\" All 3 of our family members noticed an \"off\" smell. Something like chemicals. As I headed over to the bed, I noticed that the bed skirt was FILTHY. We looked down and saw what appeared to be a combination of chocolate, blood, white \"stuff\" (dried milk?) and perhaps body fluids. All of these things were splattered over the entire right side of the bedskirt. Then we noticed all the dust and the food-smudged dresser tops. It was obvious no one had dusted or cleaned in days. My husband decided to use the bathrom and when he walked in, found blue spatters all over the toilet seat. Then he noticed the vanity was dirty and sticky. We were appalled, but realized we couldn't move because there were no other rooms available. After settling in, my husband sat down to get onto the wireless internet. It wasn't working. As we attempted to call down to the front desk, we realized we couldn't. (Though we could call out and to our parents room.) There was no other phone in the room. So, I went downstairs to talk to the front desk and was told that the internet wasn't working AND our phone was broken and they would have it fixed. (Which they never did.) As we settled into bed, the noise began and we could hear everything...the banging of doors, the people in the next room. The baby crying at 2 a.m. in the morning. Very thin walls. The next day, we got up to take a shower and it dawned on us that the bathroom vanity was located inside the bathroom which really limited our use. Also, there was no fan, so the bathroom was completely fogged up. There were the typical HI amenities...blow dryer, shampoo, soap, etc. Plenty of plush towels. Our beds were fairly comfortable, though one of the top blankets provided had hair all over it. Our room had a refrigerator and t.v., but no microwave like the other HI hotels where we have stayed. My parents room had no refrigerator or microwave. When I made the reservation, it said they would have a refrigerator since my mom has medication she has to keep cold. She had to keep her meds in our room. No big deal, but rather an inconvenience. It also got very stuffy at night and there was no window to open. Since the air conditioner was loud, we had to leave it off. BREAKFAST: The complimentary breakfast was a little disappointing. They had the same menu both days: cereal, bagels, toast, cinnamon rolls, sausage, yogurt, tea, coffee, oj, hard boiled eggs. The bananas were green and the yogurt was the \"lite\" stuff that tastes fake. All HI hotels I've stayed in have both regular and lite yogurt and more fruit offerings. Also, the coffee ran out and my dad had to take the coffee containers back to the breakfast room staff to get it refilled. FACILITIES: I used the business center and it was very nice. Fast internet, along with a printer and maybe even a fax? The hotel had a FABULOUS pool and hottub located outside with plenty of seating. However, when we went to get pool towels, they had ran out and we were given small hand towels to use. This hotel is located in a business district, which I didn't realize when I made the reservation. No problem at all, but there is only 1 restaurant (Chili's) located a few feet from the front of the hotel. So, if you prefer to stay in a more \"active\" area, this hotel is not suggested. OVERALL: Housekeeping needs some serious help. We left a note and asked them to change the bedskirt, which they never did. Also, while we were attending the wedding reception on Saturday, I got a phone call from the hotel desk clerk asking us why we hadn't removed our stuff from our room. I told them it was because we had a reservation for 2 nights. She was very nice, but very confused. After looking us up on their computer, she realized an error had been made and apologized for the inconvenience. I didn't get mad and had to laugh. It just seem to add to the unusual experience we were having at the hotel. Based on other reviews, I'm wondering if we just had one of those stays where everything goes wrong. However maybe this HI needs some seroius help. Though staff was nice, I won't stay here again when we return for the next family event. At $153 a weekend night, I will go elsewhere.", "Date": "August 10, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Lakewood, California", "Title": "\u201cNewly Renovated...Perfect Stay!\u201d", "Author": "sophie832", "ReviewID": "UR33576738", "Content": "We stayed 2 nights, from June 26-28, in Room #413 at the Sorrento Holiday Inn. Our room couldn't have been better! The fourth floor is newly renovated, with new carpeting, wallpaper, and furnishings. There was a vaulted ceiling at our window, which made the room seem even bigger. The choice of a soft or firm pillow was also nice. The flat-screen TV had 50+ channels, which is unusual for a hotel. The new furniture and carpet was very nice. The front-desk staff were very helpful! We forgot our toothbrushes, and they had complimentary ones available (as well as toothpaste, razors, etc.). On our last night, we asked if we could store some dinner leftovers in their fridge (no in-room fridge), and they happily obliged. I used the fitness center on 2 occasions, both at off-peak times, so I was by myself. My only complaint about the hotel might be that the fitness center didn't have an elliptical machine. There are 2 treadmills, an exercise bike, and a weight machine. The TV is first come, first served in the sense that it has a remote, and whomever has that will control what is being watched. We didn't use the pool/jacuzzi, but it looked nice. We did have free breakfast every morning downstairs. I would say the breakfast was so-so, but since it was free, I can't complain. There is a small selection of hot dishes (changed with each day), cereal, toast, yogurt, cinnamon buns, danishes, and of course coffee and juice. It was definitely a nice way to start the day. Parking was never a huge problem. The hotel shares its parking lot with a Chili's restaurant (convenient for dinner) and there is another hotel in the same general area, but we found parking spots each night when we returned. Since we'd only paid $88 a night, we really didn't expect much other than your basic Holiday Inn. What we got was excellent service and a really nice room.

Note we do NOT choose this brand for the food - just go find a Denny's or McDonald's if you're on a budget but you need to eat in the morning. I want to call out the fantastic service the manager, Ken, provided us (in making the arrangements) and our family (in serving their needs during their stay.) Ken is service-oriented, friendly, and produced excellent results. All the feedback from my family about this hotel, especially Ken and his staff, was quite positive. Be aware that the hotel is near enough to MCAS Miramar that you will very much hear the jets if they are flying. The jets do observe a curfew, so if this is a concern for you I'd discuss it with the manager to get the details before you book. None of our guests complained to us that the noise was a problem.
