The hotel is located at the lower end of La Rambla and especially at weekends the noise outside is 24/7 with late night revellers until 7am being replaced by tourists. Pension Picasso is located up several flights of stairs, entry is via a buzzer at the external door, then an internal door, the external door is usually open during the day but entry can be difficult if no one is on reception at night (supposedly open 24 hours a day). The receptionist had a shaky grasp of English but at least it was better than my Spanish! My room was a single with a shared bathroom overlooking La Rambla, small but clean with a sink, a TV that worked when it felt like it and a hard bed that gave me back ache. There is a WC near to reception and a bathroom with shower down the corridor, however the door didn't close or lock properly so i didn't use this! Returning to the hotel after midnight i was constantly harrassed by Prostitutes outside the hotel and the noise outside was constant, the only way to get any sleep was to get drunk and pass out! The room also shared a balcony with the room next door so there was a privacy issue there also, with people sitting outside my window! When i did check out there was no one on reception so i left my key and departed. Pro's: Very Cheap, clean room, location Cons: location, Everything else The Picasso is cheap but thats the only thing it's got going for it, if you're a student on a budget and want to be out all night fine, for everyone else not recommended. cheap and nasty.", "Date": "April 4, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "2", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "ondon", "Title": "\u201cCheap and nasty\u201d", "Author": "michielg Posted by an Easytobook.com traveler", "ReviewID": "UR125380505", "Content": "One should be able to get budget accommodation further from town centre that is more bearable.

The rooms are small and the staff don't really speak English (however, bear in mind you're in SPAIN not ENGLAND! And are you really in Barcelona to sit in your room?!) The staff weren't unhelpful, they just had other jobs to do - for 30 euros a night, don't expect a concierge service, use your guide book. I had a room on La Ramblas, yes it was noisy but not as bad as many of the reviews made out - I slept soundly for 8 hours. The bed was very comfortable and they even gave me an extra pillow when I asked. The room had been cleaned when I arrived and there was evidnence during my stay that they cleaned the communal showers and toilets.

The staff are unfriendly to the point of being rude the safes don't work in most rooms and the shower on the floor we stayed on has a step down past a large open window that is damn right dangerous.
