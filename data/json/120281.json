Dave, Lynda and Andrew are Fantastic owners ( and Fred, Tony & his wife are great front desk helpers ) The rooms are serviced and cleaned by excellent staff, I don't know how they manage to cope with the heat. The larger family rooms tend to be upstairs and have plenty of room for a family of 4. Great beachside pool, shuffleboard for the kids, plenty of BBQ space and shady tiki huts to escape the sun. Relaxing on a lounger, overlooking the beach, sipping a cool drink and watching the world go by is why we return year after year to Ocean Court. I'm sure if you choose to stay here, you will love it too.

What it is, however, is a nice little motel right on the beach at a very affordable cost. We arrived at about 12:30 on a Friday afternoon for the Rolex 24, and had no trouble checking in. The main bunch of rooms are all in a courtyard, with many facing into the courtyard. There are, however, many ocean view rooms that are on the second floor, and \"Room 101\", a very large oceanfront room. The pool was heated to a comfortable 85 degrees, and there were more than enough places to sit and eat a lunch around the property overlooking the beach. As an added bonus, the hotel is on the corner of a beach access road, so putting your car on the beach takes as long as however long it takes to you to back out of your parking spot and roll down the hill. We were in room 14. It's a smaller room than many of the other rooms, but it was also under $70/night. The room was clean, and had every amenity that I could ask for, including a fridge, stove, kitchen sink, cable TV and comfortable beds. My *only* complaint is the lack of a vent in the bathroom. Aside from that, the room was fantastic. As a bonus, the wireless internet was strong all the way around the facility.

We had booked for two nights and decided to leave early. At the Ocean Court Motel, they charge your card when you get there and are told \"Sorry mate, no refunds\" if you try to leave early. My suggestion: Don't book online and don't give a credit card until you see the place with your own eyes.

At first, going to stay one-week. Heated outside pool with GREAT MUSIC being played. Every morning the pool is cleaned; not that you ever notice it needs cleaned. The way the hotel is set up to get to your hotel door is so cozy and safe. It is outside doors; but the front of your door faces inner (away from the cars in the parking lot) so, you face inner, in this \"safe little circle\" with very beauitful grass! Lighting, soft playing music.... quiet, can hear the ocean - with staff and other hotel guests right at your fingertips if you need someone. This is a family owned business and they are precious; from England. There is another England couple who help run the business and he even helped us jump start our car!!! Mechanic on site; what a deal! When the staff refreshes/cleans your room; it's truly cleaning items you use at home - pinesol, lysol... items you truly recognize and make you feel so much at home yet still on vacation. I loved having the outdoor grills - not only do you have a full-size kitchen and all in your room; but the grills outside to pull to your room - is such a GREAT FAMILY TOUCH! Who doesn't love great, easy grilled food. They even have a little tyke play side for your smaller children to enjoy there on the nice grass. You always see the owner's son picking up things... keeping the business beauitful for your stay. If you feel like chatting; you can with the owners. If you feel like being left alone - they respect that too. There is no pressure there. Just the full help to enjoy your stay. They are also very familiar with things to do in the area; just ask. This business has families who have came for many, many years. A lot of famiies show back up at the same time along with other families that they actually met at Ocean Court. You can keep to yourself or make life long friends. It will be your choice. It's a little outdated and the mattresses are in need of replacing... but, for the personal touch the place adds - it is minor in detail. And for all I know; they have now replaced some or all of the mattresses. Updates take time. I'd rather a business do them gradually and keep the price down than to do repairs all at once at raise prices because of the debt. OH and the rooms have a recliner in them. That's a personal touch of home. Personally touches are needed; otherwise, you wind up missing home. You can also rent a laptop for $10.00 a day.

Why would anyone want to stay there for a hurricane? I don't think the roof of our room would have stayed on!! If this is all you can afford, then by all means stay here. It was convenient and affordable. But if you can afford something better, then stay somewhere else.", "Date": "August 15, 2004"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "2.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Unknown", "Title": "\u201cgood but some problems at checkout\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR2432445", "Content": "It was a nice clean place. When we arrived, we notified the owner of our trip change and he thanked us and marked the final day off. The owner left for vacation and the sons took over. When we checked out, they charged me for the extra night and said they did not give refunds. This of course is ridiculous as I wa not asking for a refund, I was asking not to be overcharged (there is a difference). He would not make the bill right, so I ask for the keys back so others could share the room for the night but was told they already had the one rented out. Therefore, they were trying to double dip the room. They then refunded one night from the one room but gave us the keys to the other which someone used from our family that night. The one son wsa just a gem and went out of his way to make sure that our rooms were top notch and clean. The one that ran the desk was a bit arrogant and spoke in a manner that I feel was unacceptable to a customer who really wanted to return but will never come back again.", "Date": "August 9, 2004"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Ocean Court Motel", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g34172-d120281-Reviews-Ocean_Court_Motel-Daytona_Beach_Florida.html", "Price": "$38 and up*", "Address": "<address><span rel=\"v:address\"><span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">2315 S.
