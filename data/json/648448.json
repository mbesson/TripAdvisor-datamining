I wanted to stay at the Royal Overseas League due to its heritage and location. It definately gives the guest a feeling of \"belonging\" to a club. Its location near Green Tube Station and Buckingham Palace, which not being over-pricy, makes this hotel an excellent place for those on holiday. It is not, however, a great place for business travelers. The internet access was very limited at the time of my stay. On brighter topics, the front staff were helpful when I arrived early. They allowed for me to take a shower while I waited for my room to be prepared. I would call that excellent service! The breakfast meal was pretty good and acceptable. The hotel is old, and gives off that \"traditional\" feeling while not looking terribly out-dated. To be a member, there is a yearly subscription fee. Definately look at staying here if you're going to be in London for more than 3 days, as the savings in the room cost will pay for the yearly membership fee.", "Date": "September 12, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Auckland", "Title": "\u201cComfortable living in central London\u201d", "Author": "irishkiwi_8", "ReviewID": "UR117608838", "Content": "The Royal Overseas League (ROSL) is very centrally located near St James Place close to the Strand, Buckingham Place, and the Thames River which are all within easy walking distance. The check-in was efficient and welcoming. We had booked a room for four nights with a garden view overlooking Green Park. The room which was on the top floor was spacious and comfortable. The bathroom was also spacious and well equipped. There was a large flat screen TV on the wall which unfortunately had the volume preset to captions and was very loud (for the hard of hearing I think) when first switched on but could be further adjusted with the remote. The internet was free and involved plugging in an ethernet cable into the laptop. The room also had tea and coffee-making facilities together with shortbread biscuits which were generously replenished each day. A continental breakfast was included with cereals, pastries, fruit and toast; a cooked breakfast menu was also available at an extra cost. This dining room also served an evening meal which was good value too. The hotel has an olde world atmosphere and has a comfortable reading room on the first floor which had all the London dailies available to read. The porters were very helpful and went out of their way to arrange taxis. Next time we are in London, we will stay at ROSL again.", "Date": "September 3, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "3", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Christ Church, Barbados", "Title": "\u201cMayfair location at a bargain price\u201d", "Author": "Joseca80", "ReviewID": "UR115124552", "Content": "Rooms are small but well equipped.Need to install wi-fi access however(available in lobby).We always take a Green Park view room.

I have stayed here twice now, once with a city view room (which was a little cheaper) and for the location, possibly the best in London, this is a real bargin. The club itself is rather old fashioned and the public areas are comfortable but in need of a refurbishment. The bar is very tired as is the breakfast room but both have a faded elegance that is endearingly English. The prices in the bar are a fraction of the price of the Ritz next door and afternoon tea was just as good. Tea was served in the Lounge on the first floor which is lovely but expect to see someone resembling your great aunt fast asleep in one of the armchairs.
