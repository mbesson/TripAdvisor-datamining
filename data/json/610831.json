When we complained about the room issues all were rude and the one woman Veronica is the winner. She called my wife and her sister racial slurs (they are Asian) when they complained, the least rude of which is that they all look alike when I asked her which one she talked to. I however (Caucasian) did not receive this treatment but was still told repeatedly that they would fix the issues and they never did. The four person room was abysmal, with a tiny molded couch for the two extra people. The pictures on the site are misleading, there is no lobby for this hotel it is across the street.

But since it was a high season (between Christmas and New Year time), the Domus Cavanis Hotel* must have been overbooked, so we got a room in its sister hotel, at Hotel Belle Arti*** without any extra payment or charge. (Please note when you book a hotel, the price does not include the local tourist tax, which has to be paid upon arrival.) The reception of Hotel Belle Arti, at which you have to do your check-in (also for the Domus Cavanis), pretends to be super busy. The staff do not provide tourist information in extended level, they only do their minimum. Until you do not start asking questions, they are nice. If you want to keep this kind attitude of theirs, I advise you not force receiving answer to your touristic questions... :) If you need plus info about dining or POIs, buy a book or look for a tourist info center. The breakfast for Domus Cavanis Hotel is also arranged at the Hotel Belle Arti, which we found to be very good. It is true that the type of food is the same every morning (ham, cheese, bread, cakes, yoghurt, muesli, coffee, tea, juices, etc.) but the sortiment and the volume is enough and their quality is perfect. The location of Domus Cavanis and Hotel Belle Arti is simply excellent. The best way to find them is with vaporetto (eg. #1), which stops at Academia. You only have to get off, turn left and almost immediately right and after an appr. 1 min. walk on a flat street, you arrive to the check-in desk. (We've seen sooo many people struggling with their huge luggages on wheels throught the steps and bridges in the inner city.) The location is good also for visiting the city. San Marco Square and all main tourist attractions are close (in appr. 5-10 min. walk distance). The price of the Domus Cavanis Hotel is unbeatable in Venice.

It is a 1-star 'pensione', but it's facilities and amenities might as well be 3-star. The lobby, breakfast (delicious and with unlimited espressos, yum!) and rest area are actually at another (3-star) hotel, the Belle Arti--which is 10 steps in front of Domus Cavanis. The rooms were impeccably clean, quite large, and quiet at night. Many had a view to a nice internal courtyard of some other building. The hotel itself is well-located in the Venetian area of Dorsoduro and is about a 30-second walk from the Accademia and Accademia Bridge, a 5-min walk from the Peggy Guggenheim, 10-min walk from St. Mark's and the Doge's Palace, and a 15-20 min walk from the Rialto bridge and the Jewish Ghetto. But hey, it's Venice, and part of the fun is walking through its back-alleys and narrow, winding streets! Do yourself a favor, stay away from the tourists jam-packing other areas of Venice, and come for a genuinely Venetian experience at the Domus Cavanis in Dorsoduro.

I agree that the reception staff treated us like the step-children of the larger hotel, giving us the run around when we had a complaint, taking three days just to talk to someone in charge, and even then, never did get to the manager - \"come talk to the mngr in the morning\", next day, 10 am: \"oh, the mngr left, you must come EARLY in the morning\", then next day, 7 am: \"oh, it's the weekend, the mngr isn't around and it's too early to call him\". the first room, a grand and VERY CLEAN red wall papered room, overlooked the back street. A/C didn't even move the air. Tried to call the front desk, but the phone didn't work. It was late, so went to bed, and then heard a huge pop and the lights went out. fell asleep, and suddenly was woken with the lights flashing on at 3 am. when i complained, the office clerk said that it must have been because i used the hair dryer and caused the power outage (i have very short hair and do not use a hair dryer). then they agreed to move us to another room, but said, the a/c is on a central system, so they didn't think another room would be different. this is in italy in july, with temperatures at 98*F/29*C. it was cooler outside. got to another room by asking the cleaning woman (give her a medal, she cleaned spotlessly) which is the coolest room around. that room was 1/2 the size, but cooler and overlooked a lightwell, which if you craned your neck, you could see that there was a garden (for other rooms' view.) that worked out ok, even though every time anyone in the building used the bathroom, the water ran down noisily in the pipe outside our window. by the third day, there was a rainstorm and must have been too much water for the pipes to handle, because from then on, the room smelled of sewage if we opened the windows. by then it seemed pointless to complain, so we didn't bother, as we doubted any other room would be better. finally, after the third day of trying to talk to someone, i asked for a discount on the rooms, and got 50% off for the first night.

I arrived early at the Belle Arte for check in and my room was not ready, so sat in the lovely garden area of the Belle Arte, i got talking to a couple who had demanded to be moved from the Domus Cavanis as their room was absolutely freezing. I was feeling a bit wary, I knew it was basic, after all you get what you pay for. Well when it was time for check in I was a bit apprehensive of what I would find, true there is a reception and bar that is not manned and the stairwell seemed a little derelict. I was on the 2nd floor, ( lift still not working) I was pleasantly surprised, the room was huge, and lovely and warm ( was very cold in Venice) spotlessly clean, 70's looking furniture, and a bed settee. I was over looking the courtyard at the back so very quiet. The bathroom was a good size and very clean, and also warm in there too. There was a connecting door and to my surprise another suite of rooms,even larger, with another double bed and another bathroom, so I was very impressed, the 2nd bathroom came in very handy. Breakfast and staff over at the Belle Arte were very pleasant. no compaints, apart from the coffee, for Italy it was terrible. And its true about the lady in charge of the coffee machine, she likes to keep it to herself ... plenty of cereal, meat, cheese, salami, cakes and yoghurt. Croissants are limited I think as 2 are placed on your table, and no more in sight, I did ask where they were and I was brought another. Overall enjoyed my stay at a very very reasonable price, and would recommend and stay there again, perfect location near to Accadamia and Zattere vap stops, very easy to find from both stops, for Accadamia take the 1st left Via Antonio Foscarini, form Zattere , the Gesu church is on the corner.
