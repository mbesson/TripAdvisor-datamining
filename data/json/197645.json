Don't expect \"luxury\" of course and the hotel is used as \"one night stop\" for tourists as part of a european tour. The hotel is quiet and despite our room over looking the platforms of the station you could not here a thing with the windows closed, so you won't be disturbed. The free in room wireless is superb and the breakfast is average continental fare and does the job fine. Free tea and coffee is available until 10pm but note they do not provide milk, despite instant coffee and english breakfast tea being served. What let this hotel down was the general service at reception. While there was a queue of around 5 people, only one person was dealing with customers buy yet there were 3 other members of staff stood in reception not doing anything at all. The beds in the rooms and the pillows also seem to have had their day. The mattress is hard and the beds are not attached to the headboard so the beds tend to move. Fine fore a few nights but I have stayed in the same star hotels in Paris, which have been better and for the same price.

These guys here were NOT! * Gentleman at checkin was very slow at getting us checked in (we had two rooms and the second one wasn't even in their system) They did accomodate us with our room types but he was not friendly to us at all. *I called down asked if someone spoke English, the girl responded yes, I asked if there was a vending machine to get a chocolate bar, she didn't understand, I explained 3 times what I wanted and she responded \" I don't know what you're saying?\" So used what little french I knew and she finally said no, there is no vending machine. *At checkout the same front desk agent who checked us in, checked us out still in an unfriendly manner and when we wanted to store our luggage he acted like it was an inconveince! * I assume she was the breakfast manager and she showed us where to sit at breakfast but when we wanted to sit somewhere else it was like a 'okay fine be that way' type attitude. * On room cleanliness - there were some small black hairs I found around the bathtub which I believe to be a little gross. *No alarm clocks in room but they do have an alarm system on the phone or you could call the front desk.

First impressions of the reception area are good, the ground floor area has been totally renovated and updated. Funky colours and a so called conviviality corner with free internet access, free tea and coffee, selection of newspapers and magazines and also a childrens play area. Unfortunately when you get into the lift and to each of the floors, you will discover that the hotel is currently a work in progress as the communal areas on each floor have yet to be done up and the rooms, whilst they have been refreshed, it is more a downgrade to a 2 star property as it is more in line where All Seasons hotels sit as a brand, which is below a Mercure, but above an Ibis. Was allocated room 725 which was at the end of the corridor and well away from the lift as requested and to be honest this was a lovely room, quiet with no noise from surrounding rooms, and high enough to get a good views from the window of the parisian rooftops towards the 19th and 20th districts. Room itself is a little on the small side, but benefit from flatscreen TV, ample storage space, in room safe, air conditioning (which was not working too well) Blackout curtain, and ports for connecting laptops to the Flatscreen TV, I Pod and various other audio/video equipment.

Wi Fi is included for free at this hotel and was able to access the net without any problems, only niggle was that the safe is not big enough to store a laptop. Noise from surrounding rooms was pratically non-existant in this particular room, although beware with some rooms which face the Gare De L'Est as you will hear trains arriving and departing. The beds are very comfortable, slept like a baby with the windows open all night and being high up in central Paris, street noise was not too much of an issue. Nice touch was a bottle of water on arrival, although it was a shame they did not provide this for subsequent night stays. Big plus is the breakfast in the morning, nothing too fancy however it was nice to have this included in all room rates.
