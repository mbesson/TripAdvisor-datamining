I based our decision to stay at Casa Camper on reviews from Trip advisor. We loved staying at Casa Camper and it was the right choice for us. The reviews were all true, helpful and friendly staff (shout out to Georgina and Allessandro), great location, well appointed rooms, great breakfast and snacks. We traveled to Barcelona during Easter week and the city was inundated with tourists. Casa Camper is located on a small side street 2 blocks from Las Ramblas and is an oasis away from the bustling crowds in the city. We stayed in one of the suites and like the set up with the connected sitting room. The hammock in the sitting room is a great feature and now my husband wants to put up a hammock in our sitting room at home. He spent many hours lounging in the hammock after a long day of site-seeing. The bathroom was modern, well appointed and large which is not easy to find in an Europe. The 24/7 snacks were a life saver when we wanted a little afternoon snack before dinner or some extra bottle water or tea at night. It is a wonderful concept to have free snacks offered 24/7!....thanks. I would definitely stay at Casa Camper on our return trip to Barcelona and recommend to anyone traveling to the city.", "Date": "April 22, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Reeuwijk, The Netherlands", "Title": "\u201cthe perfect hotel concept for a tourist\u201d", "Author": "jjk94", "ReviewID": "UR128240993", "Content": "Clean, even the floor under the bed is cleaned.

One is a nice mini lounge with a bed sofa, tv, table chair and a sturdy hammock. With a balcony over the entrance in a narrow typical old town street. The other is a relatively large bedroom with a walk in shower, toilet, washstand, bed and plenty of storage. It has a window to a patio and it is thereby amazingly quiet. The hotel is full of technical gimmicks to save energy. The whole is of a modern design with plenty of examples of clever thinking like a power socket in the safety box so that you can charge your computer or camera when stored away safely.The staff is really helpful. The breakfast with eggs etc made to order and special teas is tasty start. The tables all have clean linen, a nice touch of luxury. And the whole day long one has a free choice of softdrinks, tea, coffee and a diverse array of home made snacks. A perfect break for the weary tourist.

We traveled with a 4 month old infant, and everyone, from the gentleman who picked us up at BCN to the chief, was attentive and accommodating to our needs. They recognized that we were sleep deprieved parents, so they went out of their way to make our stay extremely relaxing. For example, they helped setup our lounge area with our son's gym and toys as well as stored his bottles in their kitchen fridge. Every morning, we were greeted by multiple hotel staff members who desired to feed our baby or simply play with him, so we could enjoy breakfast.

If you are looking for a funky place, that really reflects that 'barcelona vibe' and is central, without feeling like it is too central, this should be very high on your list of considerations. Without wanting to repeat much of what has already been said about this hotel, it is very central, but very slightly 'off centre' which means easy access without the noise and hustle you'd expect. Barcelona is kind of split into quadrants or areas, and this hotel is really well located to give you access to the different areas. I have stayed here a few times, once on a romantic getaway with my wife, and once (also with my wife) to watch a barcelona v madrid game. The hotel suited us perfectly on both trips. You are within the same walking distance from the ramblas as you are from the contemporary art museum (MACBA). The shops on the small roads around the hotel are great, as are the small cafes and restaurants that are dotted around the area. Beds are super comfortable and the separate living space across the hall from you bedroom is also fun. Very cool (think hammocks while watching tv).

This hotel ticks every box for us. Upon arrival the taxi pulled up at the end of a cobbled side street, it looks quite dark but don't be put off it's perfect. You can book this hotel direct through their web site or through an operator, I didn't notice a difference in price but the comunication was impeccable. After Hotels.com fouling up our reservation and cancelling our stay rather than amending it Casa Camper had already emailed me regarding the error so I was still booked in phewwww! It was our first wedding anniversary so we arranged a brief two night stay. Our flight was delayed by an hour and on arrived we were met by the desk clerk who produced a bottle of champagne which was opened by the hotel host who had stayed an hour after his clocking off time just to welcome us to the hotel!!! I have never had that before, obviously ready to go home he poured our glasses and bid us congratulations and left. It was a lovely touch. The desk clerk, I wish I had got her name now, booked us in whilst we sipped away and took our photograph for us. As we only had two nights time was of the essence and we had booked a meal for the next night so the clerk produced a map and wrote on all of the places we had on our list to see which were all in walking distance or were in easy access to the metro. She then gave us the break fast hours and all the usual information about the hotel and I was surprised to find that a great selection of fruit juices and snacks are available 24hrs a day in the fridge. You just help yourself whenever you feel peckish or thirsty at no extra charge. The breakfast is delicious, we had a piping hot omelette made for us to our specifications. The bedrooms are not large but there is plenty of room and the wet room is spacious enough. The added bonus is the separate lounge with a hammock. There's not much of a view but we did that much sight seeing we didnt have time to look out of the window. In the room you get a lovely fluffy bathrobe and fantastic camper slippers so no need to pack these. The bath gel, shampoo and body lotion smells divine so you don't need to squeeze your favourites into those 100ml bottles which is such a pain. On our sightseeing days a different desk clerk wrote down an idiots guide to the metro so we knew where to get on and when to get off. The nearest station is a couple of minutes walk away and you can get everywhere on it. La Ramblas is a great location for tourists so you can't get lost if you head to it and you know Casa Camper is around there somewhere. Some of the reviews here say it's minimalist, but it's not really, they have gone for a quirky feel which works quite well, I'd say it was more modern with the camper brand running through it.

The rooms are great, we had a suite, #25 this was bathroom, tub and wonderful waterfall shower, lovely comfortable bed, flatscreen TV, large front room with couch and hammock, balcony that overlooks the small street the hotel is located on, Carrer Elisabets. They do not have mini bars but instead an area downstairs where there is food free 24/7, sandwiches, deserts, soups, fruit, etc. The breakfasts, cooked to order in the morning were wonderful and this is such a great value. They were happy to put away any wine you brought in and bring up to your room when you wanted, they also have wine and cava's for sale at very reasonable prices. There is also a gym on the bottom floor if you feel so inclined but after an eight our day of walking around the city you may not need it. Again the location is amazing, three streets off Les Rambes, so not to noisy, one block from the Museum of Contemporary Art, lots of little cafes and restaurants in the immediate area.

We chose the hotel basedon Trip Advisor reviews, that is why I think it is really important to write mine here as well. This hotel is one of the loveliest we've had the opportunity to stay in. Starting from the location, right in the center of Barcelona, but on a quiet side street where there wasn't much noise, breakfast - maybe the best ever, and of course, the staff, who were so friendly I just wanted to hug them :). Obviously, the price is not small, but we were not looking for a \"budget\" option anyway. It does include lots of little freebies and lovely gestures that make you think it's worthwhile to pay a little more. Of course, I need to talk about the complimentary breakfast, which I absolutely loved. The best part is the fact that we could order almost anything we could think of at the kitchen - pancakes, eggs in every shape and form we liked (I recommend scrambled with \"everything\" - vegetables, mushrooms, ham, I just loved those) and have really hearty meals before going out to explore the lovely city. I must also mention the tentempi\u00e9 - 24 hour snack area. It has a soup of the day, 3 sandwiches, 2 or 3 salads to choose from and 3 deserts (of which one is always fresh fruit). There are also chips, some crackers, pastries and complimentary tea and coffee, in addition to water, coke and other juices and sodas. It might not seem like much, but it all adds up, and when you are tired and not particularly hungry you can take a tray to the 6th floor and just enjoy the view of Barcelona with your little snack. All just lovely. The rooms are immaculate, the sheets and towels get changed every day, everything is wonderful and I like the fact that you get proper bottles of shower gel, shampoo, conditioner, lotion that they refill instead of the tiny sized ones that you use halfway through and then get a replacement. I also liked the smell of all the toiletries a lot :) We found the design of the room quite interesting, the shower was great, the view from the bathroom window (that is actually the room window) overlooking the vertical garden was sooo lovely and there was even a little make-up corner, with mirror and chair and everything :). Over the hallway there is the living room, with a really cute hammock, TV and a tiny balcony overlooking the street. We didn't use it extensively, because we loved the 6th floor terrace, but for really hot days it's a treat to have it. I left the best for last - the staff: just wonderful. We arrived early, at around 9 am, and Georgina had our room already prepared. Everyone was sooooo nice and helpful, giving us maps and explanations for anything we needed, they booked tables at restaurants and taxis for us, everything with a smile and wonderful manners. The ladies in the kitchen prepared such lovely brakfasts that I wanted to take them home! In the afternoon, if we were not in the room, someone always passed by to make the bed, turn on the music, leave us each a small bottle of water... simple gestures that made our stay just perfect. The free wi-fi was also great, always nice to have, especially with all the internet compatible devices we use nowadays. All in all?

How it dropped to #3 I have no idea, because it lived up to our expectations hugely. Firstly, yes it's a little pricey. But you get a lot for your money at the same time. A very central location, yet utterly silent (the street is pretty noisy but you'd never guess inside). A cool, peaceful reception area and a nice selection of snacks and drinks, all free to guests. We saved around \u20ac20 a day on snacks, so don't forget to take that into account if you're on a budget! Breakfast is nice but I would've liked some kind of idea as to what they actually can make for you. We saw other guests with omelettes, so we asked for them every morning but I felt odd asking what they did or didn't make. The cereal selection was a little odd; Smacks, tasteless Country Store muesli, Special K and some type of Coco Pops - Corn Flakes would've been nice! But honestly, who cares? The rooms are big, the wi-fi is free and it never gave any trouble, the beds are insanely-comfortable (and my wife adored the in-room hammock). The staff are wonderful. And there's a big map of the city in the room; what a handy little innovation. Our bathroom looked out onto a patio with hundreds of large potted plants mounted on a huge metal frame around 30m high, a great source of natural light. We were only sorry not to have availed of the rooftop terrace! But that's this hotel all-over; innovative. It's a little unusual, the Ikea comments aren't far off the mark and if you want old world luxury, this isn't the place for you. But I like Ikea - and if you want premium comfort in a fantastic location with wonderful staff, you'll like this hotel. I honestly don't think you can't do better than the Casa Camper.

There was lovely hand cream by the wash basin, and wonderful towelling robes for after your shower!

We were given our room key as a souvenir of our stay and needless to say we were treated like royalty and like the staff were genuinely happy to have us stay there, we were even greeted in the morning by the cleaning staff who were smiling away.

During the day, the sleeping room can be made nearly dark as night for jet-lagged travelers or bright with a private view of the hanging garden. The separate lounge across the hall enables one person to check email, make phone calls, and watch TV without disturbing the other person. The complimentary breakfast buffet was excellent, and the 24-hour snack area offered a nice selection of fresh, healthy food and drink. The staff is among the friendliest and most helpful we have ever encountered in a hotel. For example, they emailed us prior to our arrival offering suggestions for things to do during our stay and places to eat. They made restaurant reservations for us, and then they proactively confirmed reservations for us each morning of our stay. They provided maps, and patiently explained how to get to the places we wanted to go. Whenever we returned to the hotel, they greeted us warmly by name.

Lots of activity that could be heard from this separate room outside if window/door opened, but this was the only noise heard from outside the place.

Its November in England and we've had incessant rain for days on end. We leave Manchester Airport on a miserable Friday morning amidst freezing, gale force winds and torrential rain. Several hours later we sit in t-shirts by the marina in Barcelona in glorious sunshine sipping ice cold beer. What a great city this is....... And what better place to stay than casa camper? Surely the coolest and most quirky hotel in Barca. First off we booked our transfer in via the hotel - much more reasonably priced than some of the usual websites and very reliable. Arriving at the hotel, we were a liitle concerned it might be too cool for its own good but a great start as we were greeted by very friendly staff who couldn't do enough especially the guy with the plaster who gave us the tour and took us to our room. We had booked a suite - worth it for the extra \u00a320 or so per night. You have all your rooms in one (rather than being split by the corridor) so a decent sized living room with hammock (loved it!), table and chairs and balcony overlooking carre Elisabets, a minimalist but very comfortable bedroom and well-equipped bathroom looking out onto the lighwell. Location wise its perfect - steps from La Ramblas, MACBA and Playa Catalunya and close to all the shops as well as the harbour and marina. We did explore a little further into the El Raval district - not the best in the city - certainly not very salubrious! However, you are safe as houses in casa camper - you cannot get into the hotel without your key pass. But as many others have commented the best part about this hotel is the food. When we booked we didn't think we would use the 24 hour buffet as we love to eat out - how wrong we we were. Fresh sandwiches, fruit, bread, soup and the most delightful coffee and crisps (the best) made our stay - especially when we took them to the roof terrace overlooking the city. Excellent breakfast with friendly chef who summons up wonderfully light scrambled eggs and divine bacon. Moans - minor ones include having to go to reception every time you want a beer and not being able to make a coffee in the morning in the room. But our major moan relates to the cost of late check out - we stayed until 4pm and were charged 90 euros. Left something of a sour taste after a wonderful stay. But overall an excellent hotel. While in Barca, do make sure you take the cable car from Barceloneta to Montjuic and if you've time have a Greek meal in Dionysus on Comte d'Urgell.

My husband and I traveled to Barcelona last month for our 7th wedding anniversary and, based upon reviews here at TA, we booked at this property. From the moment I had made the reservation, which was about 5 months before our actual stay, I knew we were in good hands. One of the hotel staff members had e-mailed me immediately to say they were available to help with any of our requests during our stay. Indeed, when I had inquired about selecting a romantic local restaurant for our anniversary dinner, they were eager to help and made us a reservation at a delicious spot called Senior de la Paradella, which was amazing. We had quite a long journey to Barcelona and by the time we arrived at the hotel, we were exhausted. But we were met with smiling faces and a split of champagne for us to toast our special celebration. This truly started our stay off wonderfully! The hotel location is fantastic - just off of La Rambla, so very close to everything that you will want to visit. The metro system in Barcelona is extremely easy to use and the hotel staff is always there to guide you with maps and helpful tips. My favorite part about this hotel was the food! In addition to a delicious made to order breakfast every morning (eggs, pancakes, fruit, meats, cereal, breads, etc...), they have a self service cafe that is open 24 hours a day and the price for which is included in your room rate! Each day, my husband and I would start with a hearty breakfast and then embark upon our explorations of Barcelona. Since the hotel is so centrally located and easy to reach via metro if you've gone farther out, we would stop back by later in the day for a late lunchtime meal, which usually consisted of sandwiches, soup, chips, nuts and soda or water, all at no additional charge! Then we would dine out each night at a nice restaurant around 9:00pm or so, in keeping with local tradition! There is an amazing balcony on the 6th floor where we would take our late afternoon snack, and gaze out over the amazing city below. Another notable feature about this hotel is the fact that each room is actually two rooms! Your sleeping quarters are located on one side of the hallway, with the bed, flat screen tv and bathroom features. Then across the hall, you have a separate living area with a fold out couch bed, hammock and another flat screen tv. We used this second room for enjoying our late afternoon snacks on days when we decided not to sit on the balcony whilst snacking. While we were there, we saw both couples and family travelers, but we never felt as though the property was exclusively catering to one group or the other. In fact, while we were there, we decided that we definitely want to come back with our little ones - between the 24 hour open kitchen and the separate, but right across the hall, sitting room, I would think that this property is ideal for the family traveler. The bath products in the room were extremely high quality - honestly, I wish that I would have purchased some of the scented lotion before we left. The room had everything you would need - robes, hairdryers, slippers, etc. I have raved about this property to everyone since returning and truly cannot recommend it highly enough. Being in such a central location, with the additional benefit of 24 access to food and drinks, made this property ideal for our visit. The decor is funky and cool, without being uncomfortably off putting.

When we wanted to, we could have our own space. The other big innovation is the banishment of room service and the mini-bar (with its attendant ripoffs) and its replacement with a guest lounge downstairs. This gives guests unfettered 24-hour access to a generous range of snacks and soft drinks: sandwiches, salads, cheese, jambon, bread, cake, muffins, yoghurt, juices, coffee, tea etc etc. You simply go down and help yourself \u2013 it's all included in the room rate.

The staff took the initiative of locating it and ensuring its safe return, and although I think that the airline was very unhelpful, the hotel staff followed up with what I suspect were dozens of 'phone calls, saving my luggage and my holiday!

It was a fabulous experience. We travel internationally often and frequently and feel that this hotel is definitely in the top three of places we have stayed at. The hotel is owned by the Camper Shoes company. The location is adjacent to the lively/landmark Ramblas Ave, but since the hotel is about a block away, the rooms are very quiet and comfortable. The metro stop (Catalyuna) was about 2 blocks away. There are a ton of restaurants around the location. We felt safe while taking the usual precautions against pickpockets. The hotel is almost setup as an all-inclusive since they have a 24 hours lounge with FREE drinks, breakfast, snacks, tea/coffee, salads, sandwiches, pastries..... It was great to come back to the hotel after a day of touring and have free cold drinks awaiting. The Staff is FABULOUS and really made this hotel special. They were all a young group of about 6-7 people who managed all aspects of this 25-30 room hotel. Upon Checkin \"Silas\" gave us a detailed description about the hotel, its facilities, transportation options, nearby restaurant recommendations, and so forth. They really wanted to make sure that we made the most of our trip. The decor is ultra modern. The size is HUGE by European standards. There is no shower door, and the sinks have a huge window with a rolling shade that goes up or down so you can view the courtyard. The bed was very comfortable. I believe the shower runoff water is recycled to flush the toilets. The Rooms are very interesting. There are only 5 rooms per floor. All rooms come with a \"lounge\" that is a separate room located across the hallway. It contained a hammock, TV, Twin bed, a Balcony overlooking the Elizabeths street, and table and chairs for snackin. What a cute concept (except for the fact that you do have to cross the hallway from your room to enter) There is a balcony on the 6th floor with a view of the city. It was great to relax up there with something to drink. We enjoyed the hot cook to order breakfast. The omelets were great. Everyone was very pleased with the stay (the kids were especially ecstatic about the lounge). The only thing was that we feel our immediate family of four could easily have fit in one room (plus the lounge). The maximum \"capacity\" per room is 3 so we had to have 2 rooms (one for the kiddos). By in large based on the rates we paid (even counting in the extra rooms) we felt this was a great value and would HIGHLY recommend this hotel.

The hotel might look like one of those hipper-than-thou places, but it's not. During our four-night stay we say everyone from young singles to families with babies and teenagers; the room set-ups seem conducive to any type of family arrangement. Our positive experience began before we even checked in. We arrived in Barcelona but were heading immediately to the Costa Brava for two nights and didn't want to lug around our extra bags for the trip. The hotel eagerly agreed to store them for us at no charge until we checked in. When we returned, we were greeted warmly, and didn't even have to explain that we had left our bags there. We were given a quick tour of the hotel, and then brought up to our room, where our bags had already been delivered before we had arrived. I offered a tip to the staff member who showed us to our room, but he refused. The room was beautiful and quiet. All of the sleeping areas are on the back side of the hotel, so you don't hear the noise on Carrer Elisabets. Trust me, noise is an issue at nearly every hotel in and around El Raval and La Rambla especially and in Barcelona in general, so to have a hotel where you don't have to ask for a room in the back is a blessing. We slept like logs. There was a turn-down service each night with bottles of water left in the room. My wife is pregnant and her comfort was very important on this trip. The staff inquired about her frequently, and made her feel welcome and attended to without being pushy. They seemed genuinely interested in how she was doing, and the manager asked us to send a birth announcement when the baby comes! We asked for a late check-out and were able to keep the room until 3 PM, which was perfect, since it meant we could relax and shower before heading to the airport for a late flight. We were sad to leave the hotel and will definitely stay there again when we go back to Barcelona. You can pay as much or more to stay somewhere else, but not get the level or service and perks this hotel provides. Highly recommended. Other quick pluses: - The mini lounge across the hall from our room was a real pleasure. The hammock, small couch, chair, table, and TV allowed us to relax during the afternoons without feeling like we were hanging out in a hotel room. It was more like being at home. Given the heat in Barcelona this month, it was a huge plus to have this room for afternoon naps and relaxing. - The comfy Camper slippers. (You can buy a pair at the hotel, but the only bad thing is that they are cheaper at Camper stores!) - Free breakfast, including made-to-order eggs, coffee, breads, cereal, juices, etc. - Free snacks and beverages at the lobby's cafe, which meant no silly, expensive minibar charges. When we were close, it was nice to come back to the hotel for lunch, or to just grab a water, a Coke, or a snack to bring up to the room at the end of the night. - Helpful, friendly staff. They recommended restaurants that THEY would go to, not just touristy places. Each recommendation came with a printed out Google map for easy directions. - Bike rentals, for a small fee, meant not having to deal with outside bike companies. Just reserve a bike and it's ready for your to take from the hotel. I've never been so enthusiastic about a hotel.

Firstly the location is truly perfect and I would not say that lightly.

The rooms are a great size with a fantastic walk-in shower and lovely view of the inside garden. Spotlessly clean with nice touches like dressing gowns and when I brought a rose back one day, a few hours later it had been put in a lovely vase as if by magic. Which brings me to the staff. I am not exaggerating when I say that we have never come across such wonderful hotel staff before. It was my husbands birthday and our wedding anniversary whilst we were there and amazingly every member of staff knew and offered genuine best wishes on both days. They also organised a cake and balloons to be brought to my husband during his birthday breakfast on the terrace (breakfast on the terrace is a must!). When we got back to the room later that day the balloons had all been collected and put in our room which was a really sweet touch. I cannot praise them highly enough, they really wanted our stay to be as wonderful as possible. And it was! I have never bothered to write a hotel review before but our stay truly warranted one.

From the mixed reviews, I was a bit nervous after booking -- could not have been more pleased with the place. When you first arrive - don't be surprised that it's in a street that seems more like an alley (it was my first time in Barcelona and apparently many of the streets are like this). The staff is exceptional -- every last person treats you as if you're in a 5-star, white-glove hotel. Stefano at the front desk is especially helpful and has great restaurant suggestions. The rooms are not strange in the least - they're incredibly practical and perfect for a business traveler who likes boutique style and doesn't take themselves too seriously (it's definitely not your grandma's hotel :) Good bed. Excellent size safe for laptops. Wireless and wired Internet. Marvelous shower and good towels. Terrific lighting in the bathroom and nice details, like a vanity area. The separate, private lounge across the hall is a small and comfortable space that is perfect if you need to work in your room - feels like you have a little ready-made office. The little cafe room downstairs that's open all day and fully included in your stay is a nice touch. Best moment ... I was late down for breakfast one day and they had just closed the breakfast room. Instead of turning me away, they said they could make me a continental breakfast ... I thought that in itself was very nice and hoped for a croissant and a cup of coffee. But they brought out so much food - one plate of breads, another of pastries, then cheeses, then meats, then sliced fruits ... just beautiful. That was the type of service I experienced from the moment I arrived until the moment I left. I wish I'd like the rest of Barcelona that much.

The suites are well thought-out with clean lines and decor, interesting features and strong colours. As some other reviewers have noted, the basic rooms have a curious arrangement whereby the living room is located across a public corridor from the bedroom. You might not feel comfortable crossing the corridor in your pyjamas or underwear - we were certainly glad to be in a suite. The hotel benefits from a great complimentary all-day help-yourself snack bar. A cooked breakfast is however also available to order. If you enjoy light, be sure to specify a preference for a high floor. The hotel is located on an alleyway and the lower floors are conspicuously dark.

The double glass doors to the lobby shut out all street noise. Jazz vocals played in the background. Our third floor bedroom was silent, the roof top sitting area was peaceful and as a bonus allowed a view of the nightly firworks. With the unfavorable exchange rate on the dollar and the exhorbitant price of even a light snack, having a more than adequatre, healthy 23 hour day and night buffet available was a cost saver and so convenient. Though the Barcelona food is a treat, there's too much to do in the city to be caught up in restaurant searches three times a day. Plus the food with it's emphasis on oil can be heavy. We enjoyed the hotel's fruit and salad. The bed was the right firmness and comfy, the room was dark, neat and elegant. My concern about the neighborhood was unwarranted. We were careful, the usual no swinging pocketbooks or back pant pocket valuables. Several blocks from Rambla on a well frequented street we felt safe night and even early morning going to our airport transport with luggage on tow. The location was perfect, a short walk to the action, but off the main drag. The staff was sweet and helpful, a little short on usual hotel concierge service.

As other reviewers have pointed out (and in some cases seem to have missed the point of) the USP of Casa Camper is its unique room layouts, whereby everyone has what is essentially a suite, a bedroom and separate sitting area. The design takes advantage of this layout whereby the sitting area faces the (noisy) street, and is seperated by a corridor from the bedroom which is well insulated at the rear of the building. Compared to El Borne our night there was serene in its quietness. The functionality of the rooms has been criticised by some of the reviewers but to my mind the hotel bedrooms were well designed and equipped. The beds are huge, the sheets crisp the pillows soft. One of the best I've been in. The toiletries were top notch too. Aircon icy and two tvs one in each room.

The taxi driver had no problem finding the hotel, even though I had taken the precaution of printing the map. On arrival, we were greeted by very pleasant reception staff and shown around the ground floor, which basically consisted of a seating area and a little room where you could have 24 hour complimentary \"tentempe\". This consisted of breads, soft drinks, juices, water, crisps, doughnuts,crackers, nuts, cheeses, tomatoes. In a fridge there were simple salads,various sandwiches and desserts. All were clearly marked and looked fresh. The area appeared to be very claen. There were different bins for the different types of waste, which I thought was impressive. The only downside to this area was that, according to my 11 year old, it felt like being in an airport terminal. The lay out and the clinical athmosphere were not what we are used to. However, when in Barcelona..... I had booked a suite, simply because my 2 boys and I would not have fitted in a standard room. One of us would would have had to stay across the hall. The \"suite\" consisted of a bathroom, sliding door to bedroom, sliding door to living room with sofa bed and french windows to tiny balcony and street outside. Therefore, we had none of this \"hopping \"across the corridor to the living room that other people had. There was a television in both the bedroom and the living room. The bathroom was ok, though the tiling looked cheap and poorly finished. It is hard to pinpoint why, but, for us, it just did not work. It was as if I was back in the caravans of my youth! The dim lighting,the sliding doors, the sparse sense of the place, a vaguely musty damp smell. In any event, it was late so we unpacked and went to bed. I agreed to take first night on the sofe bed (Stupid mom eh!) Then the fun started. The room was very hot and though we tried to adjust the aircon, it remained very hot so we could not sleep properly. The living room was right beside the street so it was quite noisy until 2 or 3 am with people in the street; short respite, then noise again from 5am, presumably this time from garbage and cleaning trucks. I must have finally dozed at 8 or so because it was 11 before we finally woke, shattered, and ran down to grab something for breakfast before it finished. The selection was good, well presented and enjoyable. After breakfast, I went to reception and explained about the aircon problem. The girl was attentive and interested. She said that she would try to have it sorted for us. I explained thaif she could not get it fixed we were happy to move rooms. She told me that they were fully booked so I said that , if the problem could not be remedied,we would have to move to another hotel. We went back to the room( I think it was 35) to get sorted and within 5 minutes a gentleman appeared at the door. If memory serves, his name was Peter. He explained that there had been problems with the aircon and that he was happy to move us to another hotel. He would arrange to have our luggage transferred and we could go ahead, inspect the hotel, and confirm whether it was acceptable to us. This we duly did ( see report on hotel regina) We checked out shortly after and I have to admit that I was surprised to be charged the full rate; though the wine I had the night before was comped. I suppose i expected more of a gesture given that we had not slept and that much time was to be wasted changing hotel. In any event, I was too tired to say anything.I paid the bill and we just moved to the other hotel. All in all, the saving grace of this hotel was its staff.

The hotel is by far one of the nicest ones in the city and probably the funkiest. I am sure there are other luxury hotel chains that will give you the feel of a \"normal\" hotel but Casa Camper is a different experience. Each room actually has two rooms across the hallway from each other. One is the bedroom and the other one is the hangout room. The colors are bright, there is a huge window for a wall in the back that overlooks in the Casa Camper courtyard. Most of the furniture is the room is trendy (you can also buy it at this famous design store in the city) and functional. The bathroom has an excellent shower and great products, shower gel, shampoo etc. The \"living room\" has a huge hammock in it, a couch and a flat screen tv. It is unconventional but if you really think about it, it is a great idea. At the lobby of the hotel, there is a small \"restaurant\" area where you can get some food and snacks 24hours per day. This is included in the prices along with the breakfast. All the people working at Casa Camper were super-friendly and helpful. The location of the hotel is very central, just off Las Ramblas close the Plaza Catalunya and it is surprisingly quiet for how close to the action it is. The best thing about Casa Camper is that it feels like \"home\". If, for example, you have been walking around the city for the whole day and you need sometime to relax, it is felt so much more fun to return to the hotel and hang out in the \"living room\" where you can take the food upstairs and chill and do not have to be stranded in a standard hotel room.

The courtyard seemed to be accessible only to hotel employees, but we always kept the shades closed in case anyone walked by. But even with that window, we got zero sunlight - which meant that we were waking up at 2pm b/c our bodies never knew what time it was. Very disorienting, esp if your body is already trying to adjust to the time difference. We didn't really use the room across the hall very much, partly because the heat didn't work in there - we could have done without it, though the hammock was nice. Also nice was getting a variety of TV channels in English - a nice change. It was great having free food there - breakfasts made to order in the morning were pretty good, and it was really nice to have snacks and drinks available at any time of the day. When we read earlier reviews, we though we might end up eating some of our meals at the hotel, since they served sandwiches and other stuff, but that never happened b/c we found the prepackaged sandwiches & other substantial food to be really... not that good. The smaller things were fine, though (cheese, fruit), and free drinks was a great thing. The location is great - it's close to Las Ramblas but not so close that it was noisy. It's also pretty close to a metro stop and a lot of buses. If you're coming from the train station or airport, we'd recommend taking a cab here. The alley the hotel is in is pedestrian-only except for cabs. The staff was nice & very helpful, and everyone seemed to speak some English. When we left something behind in our room, they were really great about overnighting it to us at our next hotel in Madrid. We loved that the hotel is environmentally conscious. This is definitely a place for younger people - most people we saw there belonged to our demographic (25-34). The whole place is super-trendy & cool - not a place my parents would have liked at all!

There was also a flat screen tv but we spent most of our time looking down onto the street below. The bedroom has no windows itself as it is situated between the living area and the bathroom. We had a comfortable king sized bed. There were some shelves and hooks to help keep this area tidy but it was a bit of a squeeze to keep 2 medium sized suitcases in this area. The bedroom area was a little dark at times, due to the fact that it had no windows. There was a tivoli audio radio, a great safe with power supply (to enable charging whilst storing electronic devices) and camper slippers. The bathroom was really lovely and looked out onto the vertical garden at the back of the hotel and was spacious and well set up. The shower (in bath) was great (nice and hot, and great pressure) as were the towels, robes and toiletries. The noise from the street below could get quite loud but we didn't find it too bad in the bedroom area, once the balcony and bedroom doors were shut. On our first night we had quite a lot of internal noise in our living area. This was due to our neighbours moving between their living and bedroom area a lot (on either side of the corridor). They had both their doors open and were yelling at one another from room to room. Luckily our stays only coincided for the 1 night. The staff was always friendly and willing to help out. The rooftop bar area had a lovely view and was a nice place to enjoy a drink and relax. The free wi-fi internet in room was a nice touch, as was the computer (also with internet access) provided in the lobby. The free breakfast (and all day snacks) provided was always fresh, tasty and generally healthy. It was really nice to be able to pop down to the communal cafe downstairs and help ourselves to snacks whenever we wanted! There was an option for a cooked breakfast in the mornings too.

The hotel is well located for a lot of the major sites within the city (eg Las Ramblas, the old gothic quarter), public transport and shopping.

We loved the unique design of the hotel from the lobby area through to the gorgeous roof terrace from which we enjoyed many a drink in the early evenings before going out for late dinner. The other remarkable thing about Casa Camper is the free food served 24 hours a day in the cafeteria. You can literally help yourself anytime to a selection of sandwiches, salads, cakes, pastries, yoghurts, crisps and a wide range of juices and soft drinks. All of this is included in yoru room rate and was a welcome addition to our stay. The location is also brilliant - on a small side street off Las Ramblas. The museum of contemporary art is at the end of the street and there are numerous lovely restaurants/cafes/bars nearby such as 'Es' meditaerranean restaurant and 'El Lobo' tapas restaurant - both very enjoyable and off the main tourist strip of Las Ramblas.

The first thing that you experience is the wonderful staff. I couldn't give enough praise in how helpful, friendly and genuinely caring they were. Nothing was too much trouble. The hotel itself is a tad unusual. Reception (and everywhere else) is painted in the camper shoes corporate colours. The reception area doubles as breakfast / snack area and has the initial impression of a giant upmarket youth hostel. There are free nibbles/salads/pastries and soft drinks available here 24 hrs a day. Alcoholic drinks are available for sale at reasonable prices. There is an amazing roof terrace, with excellent views of the Barcelona skyline. The rooms are to say the least quirky. there is a clever eco light switching environment, and the shower had the best pressure I've seen in a hotel shower for years. Each room has a lounge (replete with a second plasma screen TV) across the corridor. These have a balcony to the street side and a hammock. The bed was very comfortable, and the vertical garden view to the rear a novel idea. I was a bit confused why I had a pair of condoms left beside the bed. I thought it was a couple of chocolates at first! Still this is Barcelona! The location is excellent. It is just far enough away from the Ramblas to make it real. If you want to go to the Barri Gothic it is only a few minutes away. The hospitality and feel about the place takes years off your life, and lets you experience a welcome not typical of Catalunya.

This is not a hotel for everyone, but if you are open to new things and like contemporary, modern hotels, this just might be for you. It is located down a little street about two blocks from the Ramblas. Our taxi left us off about two blocks away despite our protests. We had just had a bag stolen at the airport and were not in the best frame of mind and ready to walk through the streets with our remaining bags. However, that was what we had to do as our taxi driver yelled after us, chastising us for even questioning the place where he let us out. The hotel is very stark and you have to be buzzed into the very plain lobby. The staff (all two of them) were young, hip and very helpful and they took us to our room to show us how things worked. The room was also very plain and somewhat cold, with dark red walls and black concrete floors. The main room faced a dark courtyard and the sitting area was actually across the hall which is somewhat inconvenient and we only used it to store our suitcases. It would prove very useful for a family with older children as I think it had a pullout couch. Amenities in the room were minimal but bottles of water were by our bed and Casa Camper's version of \"crocs\" were provided with new inner soles to wear in the room along with new age music coming out of the radio. The best part of the hotel was the open pantry in the lobby where breakfast was served. It was stocked 24 hours a day with nice salads, sandwiches, nuts, chips, yogurt, sodas, desserts, juices, etc and we took full advantage of it. They also provided internet access, including a printer, free of charge as well as shelves of books to take and share.

The staff were top notch and provided a lot of personal service, great recommendations and a relaxed and friendly vibe. The property itself is awesome in a nice location near the Rambla, but far enough removed so that once inside your sleeping room you hear nothing but silence (unless you've returned after turn down when you'll hear the Tivoli radio playing soft classical music). The rooms are funky, minimalist, and quite comfy. The bed was awesome, there was adequate storage for clothes and extra luggage on the shelves, and the save was very convenient. The bathroom was amazing...words cannot do that shower justice. It did my enviro mind well knowing that water was solar heated and being re-used, b/c I definitely lingered in that shower for longer than normal! The vertical garden was a nice and unique touch, and the shade was great for creating a completely dark room. Across the hall, the lounge was so nice to come back to after a long day in the city. We'd pick up some drinks and snacks in the Tentempie (no addl. cost, of course!) and relax on the sofa while watching the nice sized LCD TV. I also opened the terrace doors a couple of times and chilled out in the hammock. Breakfasts were awesome...pancakes were amazing and like nothing I can make at home. The rooftop terrace was very nice and provided a beautiful view of the city and Tibidabo, and on the crowds below heading to/from the Rambla. So, now for the negatives. The lighting in the room and lounge was not very good, but was adequate in the bathroom. Some of the light switches seemed not to operate anything or function correctly. The TV in the room had different (and less) channels available than the one in the lounge. Minor complaint I know, but it just seemed a bit strange. There were more English channels available in the lounge, which is where I watched the most TV...go figure. The wooden bikes looked very cool, and we were hoping to take a couple out for an hour or so for a ride to the beach. I never saw anywhere that there was an additional cost for the bikes before booking, however they quoted a rental rate of something like 15 euro for a 1/2 day per bike. While that is not painfully expensive, I think they could do a better job of advertising the bikes as an amenity that costs extra.

I had been trying to decide whether to book with Casa Camper or another hotel. I was going to surprise my husband on the accommodation front so I was a little nervous as I wanted to get it right. Casa Camper as it is not your traditional type of hotel and I worried that perhaps it would be too funky for us. Don't get me wrong we are mid-40's, young at heart but I for one like my comfort especially as I travel a lot for work and I was worried my husband might not be too crazy on this hip design concept. I was going out on a limb here or so I thought. He wasn't disappointed and neither was I. Comfort and hip were parallel, nothing was sacrificed. The design of this hotel is superb. It's the finer details that are looked after. From the massive beds with pure cotton bed linen, air conditioning, bottles of water being left in your room, a large safe for all your valuables, your bed being turned down with classical music tuned on your radio lulling you into your bedroom to huge fluffy bath towels; robes and slippers at your disposal. The showers are incredible, like a fire hose which definitely wakes you up. We had a suite so also had a bath and that was a luxury to soak in after a long day pounding the streets of Barcelona sightseeing. The hammock placed right next to the windows (with French doors and a teeny, tiny balcony \u2013 just perfect), so you can absorb the Catalan vibe from the streets below. The music that plays in the reception area and lifts is all designed, not just your regular CD's on a loop. I can't say that I heard the same songs twice and the music at breakfast was always nice and jazzy. It was great! The help yourself to salads, snacks and drinks anytime was brilliant. You would think that you would over indulge but you didn't. Water was a lifesaver. Just bring up a couple of bottles to your room and then more was delivered later. The breakfasts were great. The chef cooked what you ordered in the line of eggs, tortillas, bacon, etc. There were cold meats, cheeses, lots of perfectly presented sliced fruit (no pith!), pastries, yoghurt, cereals, bread to toast, juices, tea, coffee, I can go on... The city is a walker's city so the location of the hotel is spot on. About two blocks off Las Ramblas but very, very quiet. You might hear the green parakeets chatting away in the daytime on the palm trees nearby - amazing to see so many of them. The roof terrace is a great place to chill, grab a drink and take it up there. A real feel of the city, with views as far as the eye can see. Boy, this place was the best; totally different, great atmosphere and absolutely fantastic staff (who were friendly and most helpful but not intrusive). Because it was so relaxed and chilled, the staff really made it for us. There was always a friendly face, a \"Hello!\" and \"How was your day?\". It was never any trouble to recommend somewhere, book a restaurant or post a letter. They were so kind. And their recommendations were spot on. It was also nice that they asked us about a tapas bar we had been raving about because one of the other guests wanted to go there. That was cool to share info. Very observant! I had read up on Trip Advisor prior to booking this hotel and as one reviewer had said he would go back in a heartbeat - I can understand that. We plan to go back next year. The hotel might be a little more expensive than others but it makes sense to us to stay somewhere where we know it will be comfortable, clean, safe and friendly. Hats off to Casa Camper! Excellent - Five Star Rating all the way! Well done!

I really appreciated the little design touches like the wall of plants outside the window (hard to explain, but very cool), the light fittings etc. I ended up taking lots of pictures as inspiration for our own home! The bottles of wine and beer in reception were a good idea and we'd come back to the hotel after eating out and buy a bottle of wine to drink on the sixth floor veranda. If it was closed for the evening the staff were really helpful and opened it up (although you need to get out at the fith floor and walk up one flight of stairs).

What it does have is unique character offering a unique experience without being your usual contemporary, but superficial, minimalist setup.

The lounge is on the street side and the bedroom faces the vertical garden. In the bedroom, silence. In the lounge with the balcony overlooking the narrow pedestrian street, atmosphere. You feel connected to the city. We were on the first floor and it did get quite loud with people talking, skateboarders and the odd mo-ped. We actually loved this because you could feel the personality of Barcelona. With a young child having somewhere to sit and have a glass of wine, whilst being completely separate from the baby was a true godsend. The rest of the hotel works so well with stylish and surprisingly practical design. The music, 24hour caf\u00e9, roof terrace, room design, eco friendly nature (even the water is recycled!) furniture etc all work together perfectly. Value \u2013 for what you get this is amazing.

We were very glad that we did, but if our daughter had been older we could definitely see the benefits of the divided living-/bedroom idea.

Our suite was HUGE - living room with chairs, table, sofa (doubled as a bed at night), tv, hammock and balcony, bedroom with BIG bed, safe and radio, bathroom with tub and plenty of space. We liked the view from the bathroom - you look out to a vertical garden. It took some time to get used to the fact that you have a very large window in the bathroom, but noone can look inside, and there are blinds if you don't like the feeling... The decor is modern but sparse. we liked the bathroom best. The location really can't be beat - close to the Gothic Quarter and PLaca Catalunya and of course the Ramblas.

The Bar Kasparo on square next to bookstore is great for a drink and a snack with the locals.

It was great to be able to grab a drink from the 24-hour snack bar and go up to the terrace to read the paper or just check out the view of the city. The bedroom, common room, and bathroom in the suite were very spacious for the 3 of us. The windows in the bathroom made it a light and airy atmosphere. The slippers to use in the room were a nice touch!

Casa Camper is such an amazing place. We had such a great time! We had stayed at two other hotels in Barcelona and had such a negative view of Barcelona and thankfully we booked two nights at Casa Camper! We completely changed our view of Barcelona and loved every minute in our hotel and the city. It was rather late when we arrived but we were pleasently greeted by Sara and Sylas (both extrememly awesome individuals). They explained how the hotel worked and were taken to our room, which by the way was an amazing room! We were both so tired from traveling so we went back downstairs grabbed some snacks and wine and went to the terrace, it was sooooo wonderful and exactly what we needed. The food that was offered was really delicious! The salads, sandwiches, desserts and drinks are really great for being in the 'mini bar' I love the mini bar concept. Again, Casa Camper is worth every penny! The next morning, we went downstairs to eat breakfast and were greeted once again by Sylas and their amazing cook, who made anything we wanted for breakfast. The breakfast was amazningly delicious! I ordered an egg white omelette and it was the best egg white omelette I have ever eaten! It was so pretty! I highly recommend staying at Casa Camper because it is so comfortable, very unique and the staff is amazing (especially compared to the other places we stayed in Barcelona). Casa Camper is worth every penny and deserves to hold its #1 status on Trip Advisor. I can't hype this place up enough, we had an excellent stay and were treated really well and did not want to leave. We seriously considered staying an extra day just so we could stay at Casa Camper one night longer, it's that cool.

Then, there is the hotel itself, which is spectactular. There is 24hr access to food, including freshly made breakfasts in the morning (which need to be ordered- recommended!). The spacious rooms are extremely modern with large beds, a flat screen tv, great amount of wardrobe space, and a bathroom area. The shower itself alone is fantastic (v.powerful).

The sevice in this chic hotel is brilliant, as are the staff who work here. Conclusively, I recommend this hotel, as there were no faults to be found.

We are here on our third night, and we have been saying for the past 72 hours \u201cadd that to the Trip Advisor review!\u201d So we thought we\u2019d write it down now, since the list has grown so long and while it is still in our memory. We call this review The Reality Check \u2013 since we booked the hotel based on the glowing \u201cbest hotel ever\u201d reviews, and in reality, we have had one problem after another with this hotel. We have mixed feelings after our stay, and wanted to share them. We splurged on this hotel, and the level of service was just not up to what we would expect. (Hotels we enjoy a lot, by comparison, include the Langham Plaza in Hong Kong, the Four Seasons in Sydney, and the Avenue Hotel in Copenhagen \u2013 to give you a sense of where we\u2019re coming from.) We give in two stars for service, five stars for location and design -- we average it out to 3.5/4 stars. First, the positive: This hotel is in an unbeatable location. That alone is a great reason to stay here. Also, it has a very cool, hip vibe, great showers, and the rooms are smart and well-designed. However, we have had a string of problems throughout our stay that frustrated us greatly, especially at the rate we paid \u2013 220 Euro or 330 US dollars per night. We wanted to share them so that those of you who book here can temper your expectations a bit. We recommend that travelers looking for excellent service and concierges to think about booking elsewhere. - SMOKY ROOMS. The first night we checked in, we were given a room that smelled very strongly of cigarette smoke, even though it is a non-smoking hotel. We called down to ask about this, and the front desk acknowledged that they had smelled the smoke earlier when the made up the room. They said that they had opened the window in the bathroom and hoped that had helped, but it hadn\u2019t. There was no other room to move us, they said, and they had no way to clear the smoke out. So we spent our first night sleeping in a room that was very uncomfortable for us, as non-smokers. This is a big deal for me, as I hate sleeping in smoky rooms. It really made for an unpleasant first night, and we were frustrated that they had noticed the problem earlier and not taken sufficient steps to resolve it before we checked in. To spend $330 USD for a cigarette-reeking room just made me sad. - THEY FORGOT TO GIVE US OUR WAKE-UP CALL. There is no alarm clock in the room. You need to rely on the wake up call or travel with your own \u2013 which we didn\u2019t. So the second night, we were recovering from jet lag and requested a wake up call an hour before our dinner reservation at Comerc 24. They forgot to call us. We woke up ourselves eventually but it was a rush and we had to call the restaurant and request a later seating. With no alarms in the rooms, if you can't trust the front desk to give you your wake up call -- well, that's just not cool. - MANY FRONT DESK ERRORS. We depended on the front desk a couple of times, and we were really let down. First, when we really needed a cab quickly, they were unable to get one for us, even though when we checked in, we asked how difficult it was to get cabs and they said that it was no problem, to just call down. When they failed to get us a cab, my husband ran out into the street in front of the hotel and chased down a cab that had been parked out in front of the hotel. It seemed like something we could have gotten some help with \u2013 again, this is just a level of service. Later, we requested help booking train tickets. They said they would take care of it. But after a few hours we found out we had to go to the train service ourselves because you are unable to book those particular tickets over the phone. We only found this out because we stopped by the desk to inquire if everything was set. If we hadn\u2019t asked, we would have returned home late at night, unable to get to the station and without any tickets for the next day. Also, the hotel says there are bikes to borrow, but when we checked on Saturday morning, they didn\u2019t have any. Alas. These are little things, but my god, they add up! - FLAMENCO DANCING ON THE ROOF. If you want to sleep at midnight on a Saturday night, you might be in trouble \u2013 there was a troupe of Flamenco dancers on the roof two floors above us, which made for unbelievable stomping noises for a very long time. Although we were greatly disturbed by the noise, we weren\u2019t allowed to even go up to the roof to enjoy the show, since it was for a private event. That also meant the Terrace, which we were hoping to hang out at Saturday night, was closed to us, which was disappointing. By itself, this wouldn\u2019t be a big deal, but honestly, after all the other grief, it was just too much. CONCLUSION: We would only book here again only if we could do so at a reduced rate. If you are an extremely relaxed traveler, and the problems we had wouldn't be an issue for you, then by all means, this is a cool and comfortable hotel in a great location. If you want to be able to depend on the hotel for help with things or if you really need to get a good night's sleep, there might be better places for you in Barcelona.", "Date": "July 7, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "4.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Firenze", "Title": "\u201cCasa Camper in Barcelona: a perfect stay\u201d", "Author": "fvi", "ReviewID": "UR7987503", "Content": "First of all, the location is very nice, you are in El Raval which is sometimes said to be dangerous; instead it is very charming and you don't get the impression of being among tourists only.

Except there is no toilet there, so he had to come in and out in the middle of the night. This aside, everything else was great. They have thought of the smallest detail including a nightlight in the toilet, a fantastic shower, automatic blinds which really cut out the light, and a whole wall of hooks to hang your stuff on. there is no mini-bar-but instead you get a free all day snack buffet, which was wonderful. Breakfast was delicious,and the chef will cook up any of your favourite breakfast dishes. The receptions staff are tremendously helpful with directions, bus numbers etc. Overall a great experience.

This was my first time in Barcelona, and Casa Camper made it all the better. Close to La Rambla, and sat in the heart of the funky, arty, resurgent El Raval, the location is superb. The Mercado de la Boqueria is nearby, as well as several really good value cafes and restaurants. The Metro at Plaza de Catalunya is ten minutes walk, giving access to everything in Barcelona. Casa Camper itself is a breath of fresh air for someone who has stayed in hotels from budget dives to swisher places, and never been entirely satisfied by any of them while enjoying elements of all of them. It's modern, with minimalist, utilitarian features and shaker styling, and yet feels very comfortable indeed - imagine an almost 'hostel'-like atmosphere, but with the feeling of comfort of a more expensive hotel. The standard rooms give a separate bedroom and mini lounge, with the bedroom thoughtfully placed away from the street - these rooms come complete with flat screen TV, plenty of room, and a hammock in the lounge for a siesta. The shower was the best I have ever used. The emphasis on sustainability is in evidence everywhere - the water from the showers is all recycled and used again to flush the toilets, all of the glass, plastic and card is recycled, and most of the hotel seems to be made from recycled materials - very much in keeping with the Camper philosophy. This isn't however all crochet and joss sticks - this is a slick, modern design hotel.

I chose this hotel because I'm the concierge at the No. #4 rated hotel in the United States on Tripadvisor, the Holiday Inn Historic District in Charleston, South Carolina, and whenever I travel I always like to stay at hotels that are highly rated on Tripadvisor so that I can learn tips and techniques to help me do even better at my own job. In my job as a concierge, I try to dazzle my guests every day with great customer service, but as result it's very hard to impress me when I stay at other hotels. Well, I'm here to say right now that I was completely DAZZLED by the level of customer service at Casa Camper. If you want to learn all the qualities that make up a great hotel, you need to stay at Casa Camper. Before my arrival, I asked the staff to recommend a tour guide to take us around Barcelona. They recommended someone and I tried several times to contact her by e-mail to no avail. So I e-mailed Casa Camper--could you try to track her down for me? Within two hours, I had an e-mail from the tour guide I was trying to reach, who said that Casa Camper had contacted her about my efforts to reach her and profuse apologies about her slowness in getting back to me. Now THAT\"S customer service! When Casa Camper heard I was having trouble reaching this tour guide, they made my problem THEIR problem! We were taking trains all over Spain, but one of the tickets we were told could only be bought locally, not over the phone. So I e-mailed Casa Camper--could they get them for me? Within two hours, I received an e-mail from Casa Camper saying that they had already bought the tickets for me and would be waiting for me when I arrived! Wow---these people were really starting to dazzle me! When we finally arrived in early November, I immedietely fell in love with the decor of the hotel. There was a stunning mural of Barcelona on the wall and the whole place exuded an air of class and cool. When we checked in, something happened which I've never seen at a hotel before. One staff member took our passports and credit card while another one took us around and gave us an introductory walk around the hotel to explain the concept of the hotel and how it worked. This lasted at least 10 minutes and I later observed them doing this walk with other guests. They said they tried to do this with ALL the guests--it really made you feel special. I LOVED this idea. I LOVED the breakfasts---they made me a great ham and eggs or omelette every morning just the way I liked it and couldn't have been nicer about it. The rooms were ultra-chic and cool. The showers were the best I've ever encountered---fantastic water pressure that would come down like a waterfall. Everything was very, very clean. The beds were great, with huge pillows to rest your head against. When you got your wake-up call, they did something I've never seen at a hotel---they would ask you if you wanted them to call you back in 15 minutes just in case you went back to sleep!!! How innovative. When have you ever had a hotel ask you THAT before? The other innovative thing is this concept of the the 24-hour cafe in hotel where you could get snack or a drink at any hour of the day without having to pay anything. I loved this idea, too--although I will say it tended to be really healthy snacks. I suggested that they consider putting out some chocolate-chip cookies, oatmeal cookies, perhaps even some carrot cake for the junk-food junkies staying in the hotel. If they did that, then they 24-hour cafe concept would have been REALLY amazing! The best thing about this hotel, though, like all great hotels, is the staff. You can have the greatest rooms in the world, but without great staff, the hotel has no soul. The staff here speaks English fluently (a big plus in Barcelona, where a surprisingly large portion of the people have little grasp of English) and is in general, top-notch. I got a chance to speak with the General Manager, Nathalie Porta. She came up to me and and asked how my stay was going. Like most of the staff at Casa Camper, she was absolutely stunning to look at. I asked her, \"What is your secret? How do get such great staff?\" She said, \"We teach the staff one thing--never assume anything.\" Great advice. I sat down with her and told her my impressions and what she could do to make it an even better hotel. To my amazement, she took notes! This is the mark of someone who was born for the hotel business. She didn't think she knew it all--she wanted to know what she could do to be even better! Other stand-outs among the staff---Gemma was a super-star. She also was an example of someone who was born for the hotel business. She gave the feeling she really cared about my stay and bent over backwards for us! Maude was a total sweetheart. She did the introductory walks of the hotel and was, in general, fabulous. Cristina did the e-mails beforehand and was just as nice in person as she was by e-mail. Marilo at the front desk was also super-nice. I have only one criticism--the tour guide that they recommended for us to take us on private tours around Barcelona was good, but not great. I suggested to Nathalie that they set up a program with the staff where once a month they pay each one of the staff to go out and take some interesting new walking tour or visit some new exhibit at one of Barcelona's many museums so that they can always have current and up-to-date suggestions of things to do for the guests. If they did this, they might have found a better tour guide to recommend to me. But if you don't pay the staff to do this, they get busy and never get around to it. As a concierge, I know I am as only as good as my suggestions. The bottom line--an innovative, ultra-chic hotel, in a great location, with super-friendly staff willing to bend over backwards for you ((and great breakfasts too!) I loved it and would never consider staying at any other hotel if I ever return to Barcelona. I liked it that much!

It is very well located, just off la Rambla but in a relatively quiet side street. The staff are all young, very friendly and speak great English. While I was sceptical about the self-service food and drink concept at first it actually works very well in a hotel of this size (just 25 rooms) and there is a wide choice of snacks and drinks available. The main bedroom in your set of two rooms is large and well designed, with a beautiful walk-in shower (however using it does fill your whole bedroom with steam and humidity as there is no separating door). The fittings are all new and of high quality. All this is very very good. So why just a three-star rating then? The problem is that the split living-room/bedroom design with a corridor separating the two spaces just doesn't work. While we never actually used our living space that's not really a big issue as the bedroom is more than big enough to live in comfortably for two nights. No, our complaint was the noise every time our neighbours crossed the corridor between their two rooms. The doors are spring-loaded and slam loudly, made much louder by the hard floors in the corridor and rooms. Worse, there is a system to open the door across the corridor from your bedroom without using a key but this makes a very loud buzzing noise each time. None of this is too bad unless your neighbours are a family with children who are crossing the corridor every two or three minutes from 7am! Or the previous night a drunken couple who keep carrying things between the two rooms at 2am! Clearly the hotel can't be held responsible for the inconsiderate behaviour of its guests but the design is flawed and you risk a very bad night of sleep or a row with your neighbours.

The coast is only a 15 minute walk down the Ramblas and only 5 minutes on bike (which are available at the hotel). The rooms were especially unique. Each room is split by the main hallway common to all the rooms. I won't spoil all the surprises but I will say that the mastermind behind Camper has introduced a refreshing twist on the traditional hotel suite. The rooms inside are very clean and comfortable. There is no carpet and lots of tile which is easily cleaned. The shower and bathroom overlook a beautiful private terrace filled with shelves and shelves of one variety of a local plant.

The girl at the entrance told us about $1 for every 5 minutes which sounds very reasonable, and not a rip -off price as many hotels are taking. However when we received the bill at the end of our stay, we had to pay $23 for 13 minutes of call time. There were a few calls that no one even answered (e.g. a 3 second call for $0.40 and no answering machine answered). The other issue is that our friends stayed in Barcelona and they came to visit us, and the hotel personnel let them in, while at the end the bill showed $14.10 for this visit. Nobody told us that there is a fee involved for letting our friends in. We should have known this fact before letting people in. Besides these flaws the stay was ok, but the hotel is very simple and the price (235 euro) is definitely not worth the stay. We stayed one night at the marina hotel which cost a little more (280 euros) but was definitely a 5 star hotel. If the free food is important for you, think about all the delicious food that you can taste at the streets of Barcelona.

We've stayed at similar 'pitched' hotels (The Clift in San Francisco, The Hudson in New York, Beau Rivage in Nice) and we both thought Casa Camper was the best of the lot! Where to start? The staff are so welcoming and friendly - nothing is too much trouble and they make you feel at home straight away. The rooms - we paid a little extra and stayed in a suite and it was worth every penny. With standard rooms I don't know about crossing the corridor to the lounge - I think we'd remain cocooned just in the bedroom and the suite has the luxury of both areas 'as one' - but, who knows?! The showers were fab, the beds were the most comfortable I've slept in and the rooms pleasantly quiet. The hammock was great to chill in after a strenous day at the shops or on the beach! The 24 hour snacks are a great idea and really healthy - perfect for a quick snack to stave off hunger pangs before the late night Spanish dining! Breakfasts, too, were delicious and the chef is happy to prepare any egg based dish for you. If not, there are croissants, fresh fruit, ensimadas, yogurts, bread, coffee, juices etc etc. The district is great too - very arty and cool.

The Hotel is being cleaned almost 24 hrs a day and as you can imagine was absolutely spotless at all times. Our room was serviced each morning and prepared again each evening. The staff could not help us enough and I mean from the front of house to domestics. They all wore the same trendy black uniform and all went out of their way to keep us happy. The breakfasts offered eggs cooked to any order, meats, cheeses, bacon, sausages, fresh fruits, juices, coffee, tea, cereals. Every taste was catered for. The french guy that served us each morning was one of the nicest, friendly helpful staff I have ever encoutered at a hotel breakfast session! He remembered where we would sit, what we would drink and cleared the table clutter as soon as we had taken the last bite. There was so much good about this Hotel that it deserves to stay ranked at No1 for a very long time. I can honestly say that there is not one single thing about our seven night stay that I could criticise them for. They were all fabulous. I guess the key is that they have discovered how to offer 5 star service without all the over bearing stuffyness. The Hotel feels informal yet cool and chic. The cost is by no means cheap but after knocking off the money that one saves from beautiful breakfasts and free food and drink this makes it a rather good rate for what you get in return in my opinion. Take our advice and stop in a suite in this hotel. Do not stop anywhere else. Take the aerobus 3.50euros from the airport to Rambla and you are then just an easy five minute walk from the best hotel in Barcelona.

Nothing is too much trouble and if you are happy to do your own thing they are happy to let you. A major pluspoint for us is that it is a non-smoking hotel. In a country where it seems it is compulsary that you smoke this is truly superb. The rooms are different. We had a suite which comprised a living room, a bedroom and a bathroom and we found it very modern and very luxurious. A particularly nice touch is the free snacks. 24*7 you can get free tea, coffee, soup, soft drinks, fruit and snacks. This is particularly nice if you pop back to the hotel at points during the day. There is a terrace on the roof which is nice to just sit and chill. The view isn't the best but that's hardly the fault of the hotel. One particular nice touch was on checking out in the morning we asked about leaving our luggage as we had a late flight. This, as in most hotels, was no problem, however, they told us that on our return we could still help ourselves to the free snacks. This kind of customer service goes a long way to explaining why they are so highly rated. We would highly recommend the hotel.", "Date": "April 28, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "3", "Service": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Sleaford, Lincolnshire", "Title": "\u201cFriendly, Relaxed, Foodie, but a little overpriced?\u201d", "Author": "TomSleaford", "ReviewID": "UR5010297", "Content": "I can confirm virtually all of the previous reviewers comments. We arrived tired after a difficult trip from the airport, trains are not operating normally from El Prat at the moment, and were welcomed with a friendly intro and the opportunity to grab free drinks. The rooms are as good as described, though if you are someone who likes fabrics and freebies, you will be disappointed. The roof terrace is very pleasant and gives a good view over some of the city. However, if you are seeking an escape from the piped music, it is louder here than in the lobby. Some reviewers have underplayed the snacks, in my opinion. If you like organic juices, salads, sandwiches and home made soup, this is your kind of place. The only drawback to this is that they are so good we were tempted to eat in on a couple of nights and did not sample what the city had to offer. My tip would be the organic mandarin juice and the Vichy Catalan - possibly an acquired taste. Staff are young, pleasant and mulit-lingual. My wife tells me the young men must have been selected for looks as well as ability but I don't feel fully qualified to judge. At any rate all staff will take time to discuss your stay and give you excellent advice. I only have 2 quibbles. Firstly we couldn't get our air conditioning to work on the first night and neither could the hotel staff. (You can open a window but those skaters don't let up until the early hours of the morning.) Secondly, it was slightly expensive for a three star hotel - though we had a suite so you could stay more cheaply. That said , if you were staying with childern it would work out very well. My final point would be to agree with others that this is a little like staying in a friend's flat whilst they are away, in all the best ways. If you seeking a relaxing, friendly, centrally located hotel and don't mind paying a little more for it, than this is an ideal hotel.", "Date": "April 26, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Kingswinford, West Midlands", "Title": "\u201cThe little things\u201d", "Author": "Baggie69", "ReviewID": "UR4993296", "Content": "Have just returned from a three-night stay at Casa Camper. We booked it after reading the reviews on this site and were expecting to be disappointed as I couldn\u2019t believe it could be that good! It was. Everything about the hotel was excellent; it\u2019s very cool (without being overly modern) well located, quiet, clean and with the biggest most comfortable bed I have ever slept in. The staff are very friendly and helpful, we arrived a little early but our room was ready, and checked out after lunch (as our flight was not until mid afternoon) and none of this was any problem. It\u2019s the little things that make it the best hotel I have stayed in though. Free computer and internet access, all day food and drink, an enormous shower, a separate living room overlooking the pretty street (see photo) and best of all a tiny permanently illuminated light by the toilet so you can visit in the night without having to fumble for a light switch.

We couldn't have been more pleased. Some specifics: 1. Service - We had an overnight flight from JFK to BCN and reserved the room for a day rate so we could sleep when we arrived. We had three people and the lounge was not made up as a bed. The staff did that immediately (within five minutes). That response is typical of the service you will receive. Gemma, at the front desk, was particularly helpful in getting us dinner rreservations and giving us maps. Quick point: mention \"La Rambla\" to the taxi driver at the airport if they don't know the location, as ours didn't. 2. The Room - is very quiet, despite the location so close to La Rambla. It is also extremely functional. The wall has 27 hooks (I counted them) for hanging various objects. By the sink is a double-paned window that opens into a courtyard with six floors of large plants, which make it very pleasant when you use the sink. At night, a green industrial louver comes down and that makes the room very dark and excellent to sleep in. The shower is overhead, large and has plenty of hot water. I used the lounge to sleep in while the ladies had the bed. It worked out just fine. You can try the hammock in the lounge if you wish. Final point - check out the roof. The view is wonderful. 3. Food - Breakfast was much better than most other hotels where we have stayed. Eggs are cooked to order. Fresh fruits are sliced thin. There are a variety of croissants and breads. The food area is used as a snack bar from 1100 on. This is a great idea. We used it for a late snack once and it worked out well. 4.Location - For walking tours off La Rambla, it is terrific. It is also close to the tourist buses, which I would recommend. Finally, there are a good number of restaurants within walking distance. We ate at La Cariocoles and La Fonda, both on Carrer dels Escudellers. The latter prix fixe is a good bargain. Line up at 2015 for a table. El Pinafor was more formal. Get a reservation here. Sagardi, Carrer Argenteria near the Cathedral, has excellent tapas. 5.Trip Advisor - We found this hotel through Trip Advisor. It was an excellent choice. We found the previous reviews to be very helpful, and hope this one is helpful also. We are two for two with Trip Advisor (Paris - Hotel Saint Louis Bastille) and will continue to use this service.", "Date": "April 16, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "5.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Chicago, Illinois", "Title": "\u201cGreat location and fabulous staff\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR4972243", "Content": "From the moment we walked into the hotel lobby, we were made to feel at home.
