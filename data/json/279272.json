Desk with chair, also an armchair included. Big bathroom with usual facilities (and nice strong shower in 5th floor room). View from hotel windows (two) was city & mountains. Customer service: Friendly reception, basic tourist advice only, but lots available in central Madrid tourist offices. Web Access: I only took a mobile 'phone (good receiption) & used the reception area PC once to check emails etc. about 2.5 euros for 30 mins. Was offered free wifi (if I'd wanted it) Other Didn't use the hotel for breakfast (cost was 10.5 euros per day extra to rate I paid) and not sure if they did evening meals - I ate reasonablty priced meals in Madrid center).

The hotel is located in a residential area of Madrid about 15 minutes from the city centre (Sol) but because of this the hotel is exceptional value for money! The area is newly developed and feels very safe, even after dark. The metro stop is 2 minutes from the hotel and takes you in to the centre very easily and quickly (the whole metro system in Madrid is very easy and efficient). There is a small shopping centre by the metro stop where you can pick up food/drink very cheaply if you don't want to eat breakfast/lunch out. We were welcomed by a very friendly receptionist and checked in quickly. As a summer offer we got a free bottle of wine and free late checkout which was a nice bonus. Our room was on the 4th floor so not quite high enough to fully appreciate the views previous reviewers have talked about but it was an enormous size! The room was air conditioned had a mini bar and everything else you could need.

What kind of place this is. Seeing the hotel photos, also magnifies your desire to first hand experience staying in Silken Torre Garden, considering the attractive offers available. When I first got there and saw the hotel from the outside, I have to say I was a little concerned, since I was awaiting a shining skyscrapper, from what i had seen in the photos. But these expectations, of course, were not logical. There must be some reasons to typificate this hotel as a three star after all. Went inside, and checked in two hours earlier than normal. Every reason to be grateful about that, of course. Used one of the 4 (satisfyingly fast and ok seized) elevators, and got to the 9th floor, where my room was. I was amazed by my room. It was truly fantastic. I've payed more in the past to stay in worse places, claiming themselves 4 or even 5 stars. But this room was excellent. Very big-could be a small apartment, with well-seized windows, from which you could enjoy exceptional view. The bathroom was large as well, and all made of marble. I felt like living in a New York sky scrapper. Now, talking about the stuff, could not have any complaints, they helped me with whatever I wanted and were polite and professional enough. Room service was ok too, providing what necessary in time. Breakfast was another advantage of this place, and I have to say that it was the richest I've ever had in 3-star place. It is clear in this hotel that the people working there, from the hotel manager to the cleaning ladies, are doing their very best to make their place the best it can be. The only disadvantage could be the location. Or, better, it is not a disadvantage, but could not characterized as advantage, too. There is a very close metro station (Alsacia), which is on the red line, and connected directly with central stations (Sol, Opera etc). But it is a little far. Only a little.

The walls between rooms were very thin. The bed was very hard as was the pillow. Having said all that, the room and bathroom were large. The receptionists were friendly and helpful, but the woman behind the bar was not. We did not think that the restaurant breakfast looked good value, so we had fresh juice, coffee and a pastry for 10.28 euros each in the bar area.", "Date": "March 17, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Oslo", "Title": "\u201cHot and suffocating at the Torre Garden\u201d", "Author": "Kmyrhaug", "ReviewID": "UR10279392", "Content": "We have just returned after having spent one night at the Torre Garden. We ended up there because all the decent hotels in the city centre were full. Upon arrival we were actually pleasently surprised - newly refurbished hotel with large, clean rooms. The neighbourhood didn't have anything to offer (it was more of a residential area if anything). However, the hotel is not far from the city centre at all, about a ten minute cab ride (at around 10 euros). Not bad at all actually! The problem started when we entered our room - it was about 40 degrees in there! It felt like a wall of heat knocked us over when we entered the room. We quickly realised that the AC had been turned off in the entire hotel by routine Oct 1st, and the heat turned on instead - thats apparently when the season \"ends\", and AC is no longer a necessity. But trust me, that was not the case! We tried opening all the windows to relieve the heat, but outside it was so noisy there was no way we could sleep like that. After a few hours we decided to close the windows to see if that helped on getting some sleep, but instantly we felt like being suffocated! There was NO sirculation of air in the room. Trying to get some understanding from the staff on this issue was not easy at 4 am in the morning. So here is my advice - if you are going to Madrid between May and September you should be safe choosing this hotel. The rest of the year: STAY AWAY!", "Date": "October 24, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "3.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "USA", "Title": "\u201cGood Hotel\u201d", "Author": "Ansol", "ReviewID": "UR3986855", "Content": "My wife and I stayed at the Silken.
