We contacted the hotel prior to arriving in Italy and had them arrange 2 tours for us.....the Vatican and the Colosseum and the Forum....what a great tours! Highly recommend that you arrange for a tour (especially the Vatican to avoid the lines!!!). The breakfast was very nice and they served the best cappacino!! They also have the cutest funky elevator! I highly recommend this hotel as it's located in an excelled safe neighborhood and easily walkable to several of the main sights.

I wouldn't have minded real towels though - those provided are like large thin tea towels, and rather hard to dry yourself with. The room was impeccably clean and kept so during our 4 day stay. Breakfast comprised bread and several different, very sweet cakes, which we found hard to eat so early in the day. Juice and tea and coffee were very good. There was nothing in the way of yoghurt, muesli, eggs etc. I also loved hearing the opera singers voices wafting upstairs ( as mentioned by previous reviewers). All the staff were helpful and friendly. I'd stay here again in a flash. On our last day there we discovered a Sicilian patisserie in an arcade just off Via Torino ( the next street) and I think we would have eaten there more often had we known before.

Recommended by Rick Steves in his 2011 guide to Italy it was not a disappointment. Traveling a little off season made it affordable, and the location was pretty great. Its another tucked away hotel in a residential neighborhood on the 3rd floor of a really cool old building. The elevator is not surprisingly small, but it starts essentially a few steps up from the entrance so that's a bonus. Our room was nice, but what I REALLY loved was the windows that cranked open to the center of the courtyard/building that was flooded with the sounds of opera singers practicing from the church on the bottom floor. At first I thought it was coming from a neighbor 1 story up, but when I asked our host about it he told me about the church downstairs. The beautiful sounds of their voices flooded up through the center of the building-it was like I was in a movie. Its the little nuances like this that made my stay so memorable. Id like to mention Roberto and how sweet he was. He was always available and we had a few nice chats with him. The rest of the staff that we met briefly were also very nice. I like having a bar where you could get a coffee or cocktail and walk it back to your room steps away. Trevy Fountain was about a 10 minute walk, and the walk was great because it forced us to live like a local. We took the local metro and got around mostly by walking, its easily navigable by foot. The room was clean, and the hotel was really peaceful and quiet.I loved the catwalk that ran between the 2 sides of the hotel where you can sit at a bistro chair and enjoy a moment. Free Wi-Fi was also really helpful. There are a few small restaurants on the block where you can get a nice meal, a light snack or a bottle of wine for take away. One more quick mention about Rick Steves, if you are familiar with him you know that he stays in really cool and unique places all around Europe with accommodations from 5 star Hotels to minimalist Hostels, He happened to have stayed at Oceania few weeks earlier from our visit and had signed his latest book for the Hotel. He definitely walks the walk when he gives advice about where to get the best bang for your buck and this was 1 of those places!

We took the small elevator up and entered the lobby. It was the first time we felt cool all day. Paradise already! We were greeted by a gentleman who was doing some repairs, but he quickly showed us where we could sit down. After a few minutes, Anna arrived. We had requested that we be able to check in early, and she informed us our room was ready. She took us there and showed us the beautifully decorated room and its amenities. She asked us if we needed anything else. We asked if she could make reservations for us at the Borghese Gallery. She did!! She also gave us a map, and marked out all the places we wanted to go. She advised us on her favorite place for dinner, which was wonderful. The entire staff was wonderful, especially Anna, Radu and Liliana. A few other things. I saw mentioned in other reviews that a few people were not happy about the \"oversized kitchen towels\" that were given as bath towels. I LOVED these towels. They are beautiful, high priced and top quality Italian linens. They are absorbent, and perfect for hot climates. They dry quickly. I think if people could go to another country and enjoy the differences (what has worked for hundreds, if not thousands of years) instead of trying to compare everything to what they are used to, they would find their trip a much better experience.

The guidebooks made it sound like it's near the train station and it may not be a safe neighborhood. It's actually across the street from the Ministry of Defense. Even when I walked there at night as a single female I felt perfectly safe. The Metro is not very far and there are pharmacies, restaurants and tourist stops in the area. The elevator is tiny and rickety and if someone doesn't shut the door on another floor it won't run. Expecting a lot of walking in Europe this wasn't a problem to just take the stairs. When shown my room I almost double-checked my rate. Absolute luxury for a girl staying in the barest rooms across Europe. The room was massive to me with nice furnishings and opulently decorated. The bathroom was beautifully tiled and clean and had great big towels. For the included breakfast you sit down to a place setting already with a huge brioche roll and options of Presidente butter, jams, pates and Nutella. Freshly brewed coffee, tea, juices, hot chocolate. Pastries, breads and cakes. Lots of carb loading for the day! Outside the breakfast room is a computer free for use. The staff was always around and helpful and smiling. Like all the other hotels on my trip, you leave your room key in a basket when leaving each day.

The hotel referred us to a place for diner, which served pork that was rotten. I didn't eat it. They never asked if i liked it. The Romans hate americans and think we are stupid. The hotel referred us to a laundry. They charged us 40 euros for one small load. When we got it back to the hotel, we realized it was still wet. My daughter asked them to dry clean one pair of her jeans and they washed them, the seams and pockets were still wet. it should have cost no more than 15 euros. The breakfast was bread and sweets. The cappucinos were very good. I felt this hotel was overpriced for what it was. I did not like having to go to the atm 3 times to get them cash.

The breakfast was pastries with great coffee. As breakfast doesn't begin until 8:00 a.m., we missed it our last day there and my sister was disappointed that she missed out on their great coffee. The hotel is about a 10-15 minute walk to the Termini station and walkable to everything else. It is on the same block as the Ministry of Defense so we felt safe there.

Instead of taking me to our hotel he took us on a 10min tour, and then charged us 40 Euro. BAD!!! Be careful!!! So back to the hotel. I told them in advance I had had surgery, needed some extra pillows and a extra blacket which they gave, good point. Bad point, they didn't inform me that they had construction above them going on, so if your not ready to be up at 8am you might not be a happy camper. Ask them if someone is doing construction in the building, it looks like they are tyring to do the whole building piece by piece. Below me, OPERA, yeap get ready for practices people. Lord a mercy if it wasn't one it was the other, or it might have been both. I came back through 2 weeks later because I had already reserved my room and was locked in, last night there, OPERA at night, the concert. Sleep is a good thing folks, and for what we paid, SOOOO not worth it. Location was nice but nothing else. That is what you will pay for. Its close to the trains, and the subway station. There are a few nice things around to see but its not worth what we paid. In American $$$$$ we paid about $600 for 2 nights. Not worth it at all. When it comes to the rooms, no rooms are alike, so if you have a fridge and safe in one room, it doesn't mean it will be in the next room. They had very small bathrooms, the Heat, NO DICE, the bed it was ok, and I have a bad back and am quite picky. OH and sorry I forgot to take a picture of this hotel and the rooms I stayed in.

Oceania is very close to Via Barberini and the bus/train lines that can take you anywhere in Rome including the Coliseum. Rome is a dense city but easy to navigate and note a bad hike from one end to the other. So if you are looking for an affordable hotel with great service and good location.

Hotel Oceana has large rooms and a wc in each one of them. They offer a continental breakfast each morning consisting of bread, coffee, tea, tortes, packaged toast , various jams and some pastry. The Orange juice is simply the best OJ I have ever had! Internet is available on the lobby computor, but time is limited. You may only access it from 9 am to 1 then late afternoon. I still have not figured that one out! After chatting with Anna (our hostess) I found out that this building is owned by the Methodist Church and is occupied by several small business', individual apartments and 2 Hotels. Hotel Oceana is on the third floor and consists of 15 rooms (I think) the hotel is accessible via the stairway or the small cage style elevator. If you have the stamina, take the stairs... Its faster at times and not quite as scary. I was only disapointed by a couple of things. First I read somewhere that laundry facilities were available, they are not. Even though there was a washer and dryer on floor. Second was the window in our room. Call me an overprotective mom, but our 4 year old son was traveling with us, and the window was very easy to open and had no screen in place, it did have an outer levered wood hinged screen, but again, it was easily open with just a small hook keeping it closed. My son wanted to drag a chair to the window to look out on several occasions. With nothing to prevent him from falling out the window 3 stories high, I was more than just a little stressed. Main thing is if you are traveling with a young one, dont even acknowledge the window and you should be fine. I would also suggest that you bring an extra pillow if you like them fluffy. My father inlaw had a fit about the towels, THEY ARE NOT TERRY TOWELS. So be warned. These are very absorbant towels, but if you want warm fuzzy towels, bring your own. Easy walk to several restaraunts. Ask them for directions to Da Giovanis (great food and very reasonable...... for Rome) Another great little spot is just down the street from the hotel and is perfect for a late night snack. I cant remember the name but, when you exit the hotel and turn left, you will see a small bistro cafe on the right about half a block down. Just a quick note, they are open late and you can grab a late night Mozerella and Procuito Panini if you didnt have a chance to get dinner or are too tired to go out. The owner will even pop the cork on a small bottle of wine so you can take your meal back to the hotel. Easy walk to the bus stop and the main terminal where you are off and running. They say it is within walking distance to several attractions, primarily the Trevi fountain. You can walk if you are in shape to do so, but it is a hike and some of the hills can be quite steep.

When I travel overseas, I only have two requirements; an elevator and a private bathroom, so my expectations are limited when it comes to the decor or the personalities of the owners. The hotel had the most beautiful decor and the nicest staff. I want to redecorate my bedroom to look just like the room I had at the Hotel Oceania. Absolutely beautiful. Loved the bath sheets in the bathroom. Normally I hate the towels that hotels use, they leave lint on me, and I hate that. These bath sheets are huge and thin and absorb so quickly. I loved them - I want to get them for my home too. The breakfast is a little sweet for me. All sugar. I prefer yogart and cereal, but what they had was delicious, and let's face it - it was included in the price of the room, so if I wanted to, I could have run down to the local market and bought yogurt and cereal and kept it in the refridgerator that was included in my room - but it was not that big of a deal. Normally, when I travel to Rome, I stay with friends who know the area very well. So when they came to see me, and commented on the location and how well situated the hotel is, I was even more impressed. To sum it up, this was a very clean, beautifully decorated hotel; friendly, english speaking staff; well situated; elevator; private bathroom; TV; and much more. I really love this place and will definately stay here again; I just hope that after this review, there is enough space for one more.", "Date": "February 22, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Sacramento, CA", "Title": "\u201cA Charming Hotel - Beautiful, Spotless & Great Location!\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR4477206", "Content": "To put this review in context: I stay in at least 8 hotels a month. I am a Platinum Guest (highest tier guest) with Starwood (Sheraton and Westin) and have never received the sort of amazing reception I received at Hotel Oceania... and I am not a 'frequent' customer of this hotel - this was our first stay. I read the reviews on Trip Advisor and took my chances... If you are looking for Italy - stay here. If you are looking for a cookie cutter version of American Hotels in Italy - this isn't the place. And, for the record, I'm NOT a Rick Steve's \"minion\"... My husband and I arrived at the hotel and were quite pleased to find an ever-so-friendly staff, fully willing to help us find a local restaurant, and map out a few things we could see if we took a walk. Oceania is centrally located. We walked to the Coliseum, Pantheon, Trevi Fountain and once, walked back from the Vatican. St. Theresa in Ecstasy is around the corner, the National Museum of Rome is a 5 minute walk... The Spanish Steps are very close, too. The whole time we were in Rome, we probably took 4 taxis, including the taxis to and from the airport! Our room was beautiful - golds and greens... right on the street - but I heard little noise from cars or motorbikes. The room and bathroom were clean; the linens on the bed and the draperies were gorgeous. Our room had the feeling of Italian charm and elegance without over-the-top opulence. The bath towels are big - like bath sheets and thin - you can wrap them around you and hang them up for a quick dry. I loved them. Every day of our 8 day stay - our room was made up nicely. In the morning - a lovely breakfast was set-out. Rosetta rolls and cheese, little cakes and croissants... as well as our own little table with coffee and steamed milk, made by Armando - who if your Italian is as bad as mine - will teach you a little more! He was quick with a smile and made the morning bright which helped us to get ready to tackle a day of sightseeing. My husband and I were quickly charmed by this kind man and looked forward to seeing him every morning! We had the great fortune to chat with the busy owner - Stefano who gave us great restaurant recommendations and talked about his favorite place for gelato. It was unbelievable that this man who is opening a new hotel in Tuscany (which we will be visiting soon) had the time to chat with two tourists from California! He listened and was very interested in how we experienced his hotel and the service we received. That has never happened in a big corporate hotel (where I\u2019m \u2018platinum\u2019) - and I don't expect it ever will! When I return to Italy with my parents this Fall \u2013 I will take them to Hotel Oceania \u2013 where I know they will be as charmed as we were.

It is walking distance to Metro station, Trevi Fountain, etc. Also Church Santa Susanna (tickets for papal audience) was around the corner. It was very convenient for us to pick up our tickets.

The only suggestion is that although it is close the walk on Roman roads is not easy so if you haven't packed light you may want to take a taxi.
