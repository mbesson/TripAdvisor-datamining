The rooms were kind of cool, but nothing special, and definitely did not make up for the negative experiences we had with staff. First, we had e-mailed them with a few questions over a month before we were to stay there, and we requested to be put on the Newsletter list as well (two separate e-mails), but we never received any responses (this should have been a big enough red flag for me to change our reservations to another hotel - live and learn). We did receive a Newsletter the week after we returned (which is ironic considering the issues we had over it while we were there - see below). Next, we decided to do most of our gambling there in order to maximize our points for comps, etc. Although we are admittedly low rollers, I was told before we planned the trip that low rollers were the bread and butter of Vegas and would be valued as customers regardless of how much we gambled. This was not our experience. While playing slots the first full day we were there I had three drinks in four hours and one of them I had to go to the bar and pay full price for. When we inquired as to whether that level of (non) customer service was routine, we were informed that the waitresses come around once every 20-25 minutes. We gambled there for four days, and I can assure you that that is complete B.S. (BTW I tipped a dollar or two every time I was bought a drink). Not very business savvy considering they're serving cheap rail booze that is watered down to people who are dropping a couple hundred dollars a day in the machines. Then, when we signed up for the players club card we mentioned the fact that we had e-mailed them as well as signed up for the Newsletter prior to coming, but never received a reply or a Newsletter. We were offered no explanation as to why they do not respond to e-mails (despite their website encouraging you to send one). We were however, given a current copy of the Newsletter, but when we went to use one of the coupons in it ($5 off a meal at Cafe Cortez) we were told that we needed to go back to the players club to have the coupon validated (why give someone coupons and not validate them on the spot so the customer has to make a trip back in order to use them?). So I went back over to the players club (a short walk from the cafe) only to be interrogated as to how I received a Newsletter without being on the e-mail list. I explained that we had indeed attempted to get on the list a month prior to our visit, but were not put on it, so the girl at the players club desk at the time gave us a copy. I was treated very rudely and all but called a liar. Needless to say, we were not able to use any of the coupons in the Newsletter during our stay. The Cafe Cortez is no bargain, and the food is not very good. Half the quality of Perkins for comparable items, same price ($9 eggs Benedict - my eggs were undercooked both times I ordered it). 1 out of every 2 times we ate there, someone at a table near us sent food back (one guy had a waitress argue with him as to the definition of 'medium' - I saw his steak, it was bleeding). I ordered a $4 chocolate milkshake, which I technically received, but it was made with vanilla ice cream and some cheap chocolate flavoring. Over all, we were not impressed with the food there. Four day stay, maid service once. Enough said on that subject. I'd be willing to go back to Vegas and stay at different hotel, but my Fiancee does not want to go back, period. She doesn't want to run the risk of a repeat if we were to bring guests along as it would be quite embarrassing.This was a fact finding mission, thinking we may get married in Vegas and wanted to find a place that we could afford to lodge our wedding party at (despite explaining this, our level of customer service did not improve). Considering half our budget was earmarked for gambling, we could have spent the same amount and gone to Jamaica or some other sunny, white beached location, which we will do next year. I have never experienced such poor customer service at a hotel in my life (despite working on the road for several years and staying in mostly cheap hotels). In the long run, I felt as though the MOB still runs the hotel and could care less about the customers. If you're young and still into partying 24/7, stay on the strip, if you're older and not into the party scene I'd recommend the Fremont St./downtown area, but stay clear of the El Cortez regardless of what a \"bargain\" you get. When I'm spending a couple thousand dollars on a vacation I require good customer service. However, the El Cortez made us feel more like a burden than a blessing.

We can easily stay at a low quality hotel and enjoy it. We have stayed on other hotels on Fremont over the past 12 months. So, we were expecting so much more. THE GOOD: We totally got the art deco style of the hotel and of the room. We had a room opposite Ogden Ave. So, the room was quiet without street noise. We appreciated that. We also liked that security was outside the main doors at all hours of the day. Says something about the area but as NYers, we felt safe. THE BAD: Lime green rooms. Really?!?!? We get the whole art deco thing but puke! We had the Super Suite. Hearing that, you'd expect an amazing suite right? Nope. Just two rooms combined. The main room was lacking seating areas. It was like they just threw in a terrible couch and nothing else. There was too much empty space in the room. We have stayed at THE Hotel suites where it was much nicer. This was way more tacky than upscale. The shower door did not work and the mirror was not conducive to applying makeup. There was too much space between the mirror and the edge. The sinks splashed water everywhere. Our room was given to us with two tissues left in the box. :( On top of that, there were only two towels provided. Not to mention, for a super suite, no hot tub. In fact, no tub at all. Let's not even talk about the bed. OUCH! Hard as a rock and no fitted sheets. We were woken up half way through the night with clumps of sheets in our backs. While the hotel is billed as near Fremont Street, it is actually quite a walk. We made the walk in the morning for Dunkin Donuts and it took 20 minutes through many bums. The El Cortez elevators and casino smelled like awful old lady perfume. It was piped in. Terrible smell. This review would not have contained so many negative points had it not been for the price. We paid $90 a night for a Monday and Tuesday stay. We could have had a much better room on the strip for that price or a much nicer room on Fremont.

First of all it is quiet! No loud casino noise and no smell of tobacco in the hall ways. I guess you could say it was Las Vegas's version of a boutique hotel. Check in at the El Cortez was quick and efficient. Our \"suite\" was very new, and modern - kind of tropical/Miami modern. The walls are green and the furniture is modern black and white. Actually quite tasteful. The bed was comfortable and the room had a large flat screen TV. It was not however a true \"suite\" but a fair sized hotel room. I understand we had the middle sized \"suite\". There are some larger and some smaller. It was okay, but we would not have wanted to stay in a smaller room so it may be good advice to make sure you know what size room you're getting before you make a reservation. Service was excellent and friendly. We met a fellow who had worked their for years who told us that parts of the movie \"Casino\" were filmed there when it was a different hotel. The only draw back is the area that the El Cortez and the Cabana Suites are located in. There are a lot of homeless folks in the area.

The clock radio/iPod player did not work, and it took three phone calls and a visit to the front desk before it was replaced. Dirty glasses were not replaced during cleaning, and communication between the front desk and maintenance seemed a little lacking. The El Cortez is about two blocks east of the other downtown hotels.

I had read the good reviews and also nearly always stay in Downtown LV. I avoid the Strip like a dog avoids a bath. The El Cortez - which this is part of, though a separate building - offers excellent odds in gaming alongside a - I will say \"interesting\" - cast of characters. Check in was easy (though we all stopped and watched security guards hustle an unruly patron off the casino floor), but you must check in in the main casino, then walk across the street to the Cabana Suites; really no problem at all. The lobby is cool...think funky-bright-retro-South Beach and you get the idea. The room was more of the same...really bright green colors with black and white tiles in the bathroom. Some nice amenities not found at much more expensive hotels, like a mini-fridge. In room safe too. It was small but for the price, more than adequate. But a couple of problems knocked what could have been a five-star review into a three-star review by not doing what a hotel at ANY price level should achieve. First, two of the pillow cases were pretty badly stained. It looked like lipstick, and for the sake of thinking positively, I am going to assume that that was what it was. There were also dark smudges on the same pillowcase. I THINK the pillowcases were CLEANED...I THINK...At any rate, we asked housekeeping to change it and they did. Clean linens in a hotel are non-negotiable, and this was not acceptable. Second, there was an issue with the heating/AC unit in the window. When it was in the cool mode (though it was January, our room was very warm), it made a bizarre and annoying noise my brother compared to \"his neighbor shoveling the driveway,\" with a bizarre scraping noise that was periodic but jarring and annoying when trying to sleep. We called the front desk twice and twice the front desk called maintenance and twice maintenance never showed up. On a third call, my brother went over to the AC unit, took out the filter, washed it out, put it back in, problem solved. Need I say this really wasn't his job? Some things have been written about the neighborhood. I have to say that I never felt threatened at all, but there are some shady looking characters in the periphery. In theory, a security guard is supposed to be in front of the entrance 100% of the time; in reality, I saw one about 85% of the time. Cigarette break? You do need to use your room key to enter the building. Bottom line? Safe. But if wide-eyed, bearded desperados in the vicinity freak you out, you might want to reconsider. Even with all the negatives I have just written about, for the price, it is really hard to come down TOO hard on Cabana Suites. I think I just got a \"lemon\" of a room because of the pillowcase stains and HVAC issues.

It took a little getting used to - checking in inside the El Cortez itself, where the front desk clerk couldn't really explain where the Cabana Suites were (we found them easily, but maybe they should make a little map to give to guests). Once there, we really liked it. It's not a casino, just a small hotel building, with a secure entrance, and there is plenty of security around and usually a front desk clerk there as well. Our room was small, but well provided for, though they had a single cup coffee maker with only one packet each of regular coffee and decaf, making me wonder if we were going to fight over who got the caffeine in the morning (it didn't matter - the coffee was so bad we just left and went somewhere to get good coffee). The shower was great, and the room was exceptionally clean - and quiet. The wi-fi is ridiculously expensive, and after road-tripping all over the west this summer, every other hotel offered free wi-fi. The bottled water of the mini-bar (that was it for the mini-bar, actually), was reasonable at $2, but M&Ms for $6 is a bit steep. So, a little tweaking may be in order, but overall, the Cabana Suites were a delightful surprise, and we'll be glad to return. One other point is that the parking garages across the street seem a bit scary at night.

I had been to Vegas once before, and never made it to Freemont street. Freemont street is interesting. A lot of rundown casinos and different crowd, I was scared when we walked through the actual El Cortez to check in, that the photos and reviews I found online about the cabana suites were false. I was thankfully wrong. While the original El Cortez is indeed run down and full of smoke, the cabana suites are a breath of fresh air. The building looks like something you would find in south beach Miami, which drew me to it. It is definitely a a boutique hotel. I read a review on here about someone complaining that the photos look nothing like the rooms and they are the lobby. Well anyone with half a brain would have actually seen the captions of the photos and researched their room on the website to see that those are in deed *ding ding ding* THE LOBBY! Sorry I had to put that in there. If you are going to write a negative review about something, at least be intelligent enough to do your research. With that said WE LOVED OUR STAY! The rooms were very clean and nice. The toiletries were nice as well. The staff was friendly. The fitness center is free here as well and it's in the cabana building. Most places on the strip charge $25-30 for one day. So that was really a nice benefit. Pros: + Clean room! + the bathrooms are super nice- all Kohler (sinks, toilet, shower), aesthetically nice, and HUGE shower! + The bed was super comfortable! + It's perfect for two people. + There is a mini fridge, which was perfect for our bottled water. + They have boxes of treats that if you choose to open them you buy them, but it's not terrible in price. Especially the fiji water they are only $2.00 a piece, at XS night club in the Encore, the same exact fiji bottle is $8.00. + Free fitness center and it's nice. +They have security guards outside at all times and you must have a room key to even enter the front lobby of the cabana suites building. I appreciated the extra security. Cons: -It's pretty dark in the room and bathroom. doing make-up is a challenge, but not so much that you can not do it. -It's on Freemont street. which is okay if you want to check out the Golden Nuggets shark tank pool (which is awesome!) and see the Freemont street experience. But if you want to be closer to the strip than this will be a con. But it's not that far, plus you get to see all the wedding chapels when you drive toward the strip ( and that includes the one in the Hangover). ha! -The rooms are not super big. If you are thinking suites must have large square footage than this is not for you. But if you appreciate trendy, funky style, bright colors, and a modern twist with plenty of (cozy)space for two people this is up your alley. -Internet is not free. Tips: ***You can take Las Vegas BLVD to the strip, but the 15 is right around the corner from the hotel and much quicker (most times of days) if you desire to go to the strip, and that really helps since you will be staying a bit further away. ***Freemont Street has it's own charm. Especially since the Neon graveyard has been revitalizing old casino signs and placing them through out Freemont Street. It's super cool to see the old signs \"floating\" from the past. ***We broke our trip into two parts, staying the weekend (the most expensive rooms are always over the weekend) at the El Cortez because the rooms were significantly cheaper. Then during the week we stayed on the strip. This is a great way ( if you don't mind moving) to see a lot more of Vegas. ***You will also need a car. Although on the strip or off the strip I truly believe you should always rent a car, unless you either enjoying walking for long periods of time or waiting in long lines for taxis. If you have reservations ANYWHERE I highly recommend having a car at least that day, or planning to be ready at least two hours ahead of time to give ample time to get where you need to go. All in all we loved our stay here. If you are looking for cheaper rooms with all the amenities most casinos have than this is a great place to stay. Especially if you are at all interested in the historic aspect of Las Vegas, because you are smack in the middle of it on Freemont Street. The toiletries were nice, the staff was kind and helpful, and our stay was very pleasant.

Not a prime location is also slightly on the negative for me but was offset by being quiet.", "Date": "April 4, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Letchworth", "Title": "\u201cWorth the trip downtown\u201d", "Author": "beligerent_ghoul", "ReviewID": "UR59849667", "Content": "My wife and i stayed here in March, the first thing to realise is that these are separate to the hotel, which seemed a little more downtown, these cabanas are fantastic, stylish, large TV, fridge, massive shower, ipod dock, just all round quality, the building has the most courteous staff on duty 24 hours.

This is one of the best rooms for the money I have ever stayed. The room was clean and very comfortable. I Loved the wall mounted flat screen TV which had HD channels. The bathroom had a good size shower. Front desk staff were friendly. Security was also good. Parking was across the street. It is an easy walk from the car parking lot to the hotel room. A nice touch was the complementary fruit in the lobby. No complaints. A good location to walk to Freemont Street and catch the bus to the Strip.
