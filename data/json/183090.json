Weird thing about the room was that the bed was one that you can flip up into the wall, so there was a big hole from the top of the bed to the wall, and if you drop anything in there, it's hard to get out. I also want to point out that you should be prepared to walk a bit from each area of the hotel to another since it is so big! Its location is great - close to a lot of restaurants and bars, the ACC, Rogers Centre, and it is right by the harbourfront.

I have stayed at this Westin a number of times of the years and in the past I have really enjoyed it. This time however my experience was slightly different and, I hope, it is not the standard/direction that this hotel will continue to pursue. First though, the good aspects: Check-in was quick and efficient -- when you come in from a long flight, late at night, the last thing you want to do is wait an endless amount of time for the check-in process to be completed. I was checked in and in my room within 5 - 7 minutes of arrival. Very good and since there was a large conference going in the hotel, serious kudos to the front desk staff for managing things so efficiently. The gentleman who was running the hotel gift shop was extremely pleasant -- always a ready smile and just an overall nice guy. A good ambassador for his little shop and one that other staff in the hotel would be wise to follow. The Bad: Upon arrival in my room, I unpacked and got ready for bed. For a hotel that markets its beds as \"heavenly\" mine was lumpy, dumpy and pretty blase. The sheets were rough, there was a stain on them (the sheets were clean but seriously, has nobody in the laundry room of the hotel heard of bleach?!) and the mattress pad under the sheets felt really lumpy and like it was pretty old. The bathroom was also a disappointment. \"Heavenly shower\" it says on the shower head --- that is caked in mildew. Right, I'm sure heaven's showers look JUST like that. Small little bathtub and plastic cups in the bathroom. It was like I was in some bathroom crossed between a run-down roadside hotel and some small town 3-star joint that markets itself as THE place to stay. Light in the closet was burnt out. I did some ironing the next morning but as I was running late for my meeting I darted out before I had a chance to put the ironing board and iron away. Imagine my surprise when I came back to my room hours later to find that while the room had been cleaned, the ironing board and iron were left out, cord strewn across the floor. My understanding is that housekeeping can and should be taking care of that. They didn't. Water and an evening turn-down service is offered for hotel guests -- or ostensibly it is anyway. I was there 3 nights. I received one bottle of water and that's it. No turn down service and the other two nights I was there there was neither water or turndown. Fail. I had gone down to have a lunch meeting in the lounge restaurant on the second day I was there. As the carafe that had come with my breakfast was still full, and as I had work to do after my lunch meeting, I left a note stuck to the top of the carafe that said \"Please do not remove the carafe as I would like to finish the coffee later\". I returned to my room to find, you guessed it, the carafe gone. Do people not read anymore? The service in the lobby lounge is abysmal. The server we had left us sitting there for 15 minutes before I had to go on a search to find her. I asked the bartender if they were open (it was 12:30 pm) and he said yes, they were. The server came out of the back and was like \"I'm coming, I'm coming\". Followed me to the table, pretty much dropped two menus on the table and bolted. Service was pretty much like that for the rest of the time I was there. To say it was slow would put turtles to shame. We ordered appetizers that took 30 minutes to arrive, despite the lounge being almost empty, then the meal arrived 20 minutes after the appetizers were taken away. Had to go on a search again to find the server, who had mastered the vanishing act, if I could have another Diet Coke. Also, the time lag between requesting the bill and actually getting it was abysmal. 3 star service and I'm being way too generous. Food was, well, bland. I needed to book a car service one more whilst I was there. I called the Express Service line for guests and they put me in touch with the doormen who handle the taxis, cars, etc. The doorman then proceeded to tell me to just take a cab. When I go to a 4 star hotel I don't expect to be told by the staff what I can/can't take for a long drive. Needless to say that he was so unhelpful, I wound up calling the car service myself. I wanted to have a drink while in my hotel room so I opened the bar fridge -- only to find it empty. They no longer offer mini bars in the rooms apparently. You can either call room service (with the requisite service charge for delivery) or stack your mini bar yourself. If I wanted an empty fridge and the ability to grocery shop, I'd stay at a Hilton Express. I should also note that they could do a bit better job at clearing the room service trays that were in the hallways. They sit there unacceptably long. All in all, a forgettable stay that I won't soon repeat at the Westin Harbour Castle.", "Date": "March 16, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Saint Louis, Missouri", "Title": "\u201cHeavenly bed\u201d", "Author": "eliza124", "ReviewID": "UR126068329", "Content": "I am currently living about 30 minutes from downtown Toronto, have been down several times for a visit, but decided I want to spend the night.

We enjoyed the Westin, but must say that had we not secured a deal on Hotwire, I would probably been far more underwhelmed. The room was satisfactory. It was clean, had the typical amenities one finds at a normal hotel, but nothing out of the ordinary. One bonus was the flat screen t.v., but that has become fairly standard by now. There was a surprising lack of information about the hotel in the room, and I still don't know whether they have a pool or a workout room although I assume they do. And there was a surprising lack of information about the surrounding area, especially the Queens Quay area, which they are right in the middle. What did irritate me was the continuing list of add-ons we were asked for, such as harbour view, the $5 coupon for not using the maid service, an extra charge for internet, the outrageous parking fee/valet service, the skimpy number of towels and one bathrobe for two people. For a four star hotel, I've really had far more amenities and better service at a Holiday Inn. However, the biggest disappointment of the trip was the Sunday evening meal at Toula, their rooftop restaurant. We arrived at the hotel at 5pm and I had reserved a table for 8:30pm. When we got there, there was only one other couple eating and single male at the bar drinking. The host sat us and then gave us a story about a mishap in the kitchen and there would only be pasta and salads. Being that hour and not really wanting to tramp around looking for a restaurant, we stayed. Soon after we arrived several other tables without reservations showed up. Miraculously, they were able to eat grilled items. It turns out the host was trying to get us to leave, thinking they could take an early night.

Love the location, and the amenities such as the pool and gym and squash courts have always been an attraction to us, as well as the location on the Toronto waterfront which is getting more and more built up and now offers lots of restaurant and grocery options. This month we stayed for a week and paid for a package that included breakfast buffet for two people. On check in we were told that our rate only covered one person for breakfast, and were given just enough coupons for the week for one of our party. So, we adjusted our plans and the second person paid cash for breakfast each day. On the second last day of our stay my wife contacted the front desk to confirm the rate that we were quoted and found out that we were in fact supposed to have breakfast included for both of us. Instead of adjusting the rate, the front desk staff simply gave her a stack of breakfast coupons (four more) which we now were unable to use as there was only one day remaining in our stay. Seems kind of ridiculous, paying $ 30 a person per day for a prepaid meal amenity and not being given access to it. I tried to get the bill adjusted on checkout and got a runaround that this was a fixed online rate and couldn't be changed. So, we're out $ 30 per day for a one week stay.

From the moment you arrive, you're reminded of this. You need to find parking across the street. Or next door. Or anywhere really, other than the hotel. Unless you want to pay valet pricing. Which will run you about $30 a day. But wait, the valet parking fills up REALLY quickly because the hotel is so large. So actually, you're parking across the street. Get inside and you'll find the check in area to your left - about 20 booths. And yet there is still a line! Amazing how that works. Check in is quick and painless, but be prepared to walk. Elevators are fast, but if you're unlucky and you get a room near the edges, you'll have a 5 minute walk from room to elevator every morning. This hotel is big. And it never ceases to remind you of this. Rooms are average for the type. A bit worn down but overall comfortable. Certainly not worth the scratch they're asking for. On the plus side, room service is quick, the rooms are very clean, and everything works as advertised. As for restaurants - breakfast buffet downstairs is quite good. Recommended. Room service is pretty terrible. Not recommended. If you're visiting in the winter, note that although this hotel is reasonably close to the downtown (and very close to the Air Canada Center), it is still in a sort of no man's land of concrete due to the Gardiner Expressway which creates wonderfully frigid gusts of wind. You will be cold. On the plus side, it is also very close to the Harbour 60 restaurant, so if you like great (but expensive!) steaks, have at it. As a conference center, the Westin is lacking - again the size thing. Rooms are relatively very far from the conference halls. 10-15 to get there in the morning with elevator traffic at highest volume. Plan accordingly. Lastly, I can't forget to mention picking up your car from valet. Chaos theory taking place right in front of you. Again, be prepared to wait - possibly for about 20 minutes. In summary - you'd never pay to stay here for anything but conference business.

If you have to stay there for a convention, you'll be fine. But there may be better, more centrally located options for business. Also hotels with a more personal, less generic feel. That said, there are some real positives here. The lakeside location makes this a great spot for spring and summer. Not so for winter. It's just too dead in that area in the winter. The indoor pool is great and it overlooks the lake giving you the feeling you're swimming on a cruise liner. The changing rooms are fantastic and include a sauna. The recreation areas for kids/families are great. There's an outdoor play area and tennis/basketball courts. They even have a little kids play area near the pool.

I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t think I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve ever seen a bathroom that small in a hotel in North America, outside of New York City. That was probably the only negative thing about this hotel. The Westin had a very good gym that was not crowded and a decent size pool that was big enough for laps. One lane was roped off so you actually could swim laps even if there were kids in the pool. The location is mixed. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s only a 12-minute walk to the business district but feels cut off from the rest of the city. This can be a positive or negative depending on your perspective. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s probably a better location in the warmer months. I was there in the winter and was unable to walk on the lakeside trails due snow and ice. I was concerned that there would not be many restaurants in this location, but there is a Thai restaurant 5 minutes away, and a Chinese restaurant (Pearl Harbourfront) that is even closer. The food was great and it was right on the lake. So in conclusion, I enjoyed my stay here and will most likely return on my next trip to Toronto.", "Date": "February 18, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "1.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "canada", "Title": "\u201cManager of the Spa has no idea how to treat customers\u201d", "Author": "Avidtraveller04", "ReviewID": "UR124724868", "Content": "My friend and I booked a massage and facial at this spa.

I wrote to the management about the incident but was unanswered which so uncharacteristic of Starwood properties. I have always received a response.

Room was clean, a good size, and the king-size bed was comfortable. The room had a flat screen TV, though not a particularly big one. Still the reception was good.

The only negative experience we had was at about 3 in the morning Sunday.

I am not one to complain and didn't have time or energy during the day to ask for a room switch so I just sucked it up. However I did mention it during my checkout and was delightfully surprised when management spontaneously offered up a free nights stay on my next visit. They assured me they would look into the fan issue of the room and fix the thermostat. So customer service definitely means a lot to them. Would I return to this hotel despite the issue with my room? Yes. I would.

The hotel is truely a \"full service\" hotel. Pros Great location - there are multiple restaurants and bars and sights to see within walking distance of the hotel. Where we were working was downtown and within a 20 minute walk every day. The hotel was very lively, there were conferences, UFC fighters, and many people in and out making the lobby and bar scene quite lively Rooms with a view - I had three different rooms over the course of my stay. Two with views of the CN tower and one with a corner view of the harbour and city. The corner rooms are awesome...really nice views. Work out facilities - very nice workout room with a lot of equipment, treadmills and elipticals. Also a really nice pool area. Cons Toronto is in general an expensive city. You'll notice this when a beer at the bar costs you $10 and a coffee and muffin from the little Starbucks costs you $7. Some of the paint in the room is getting a little worn. Self parking is $30, but I think you can park in the same lot for $15 a day, so I'm not sure why the markup? Maybe because of in and out privileges? The hotel also did a great job resolving an issue for me. One afternoon I returned from work and the connecting door in my room was ajar (save for the latch). They moved me no problem to a room with a better view. Kudos to the staff.

Everyone at the Westin Toronto is very friendly and helpful, including Gus and Goran at the front desk. They were able to get my friend a room, even though they were sold out. There is alot of energy at the hotel and seems to attract many young adults. From the airport, it is very easy to get to the hotel on the Airport Express bus that is on the curb as you exit the airport. The fare was $23.95 one way and $39.95 round trip. The first stop is the Westin and the ride was comfortable and quick.www.torontoairportexpress.com. The valet parking is $40. The check-in was smooth and I was in room 2639 in the north tower with an excellent water view. There are 35 floors in this building. The room was large with king Westin Heavenly bed, desk, lounge chair, mini refrigerator and 30\" flat panel TV. There was a large closet with safe and iron board. I really enjoyed the Starbucks coffee maker with tea also, in the room. The bathroom had a tub/shower combo, robe, slippers and the small size Westin toiletries. I loved the counter makeup mirror, usually they are wall mounted and I am short, so they're always too high. As a Starwood Platinum member, you get free bottled water daily and in room internet access. The weather was rainy and I was going to explore the city before my meetings, but it was so nice to hang out at the indoor pool and just relax. The pool (open 5 am - 11 pm) , fitness center and locker room (with sauna and steam room) is located on the 5th floor with the Westin Kids Club. The weather was 15 degrees colder than normal and the HVAC was not adjusted for this. My room was too cold for my liking and I met Kevin, the Director of Engineering and he was right on it! Unwind in the lobby is Mon-Fri from 5-7 pm and they serve small bites. Our last night, we were going to find a restaurant close by and were so exhausted we sat in the lobby bar and had small plates. There was a good variety of choices on the menu and we were happy. There is a small store across the street for drinks and snacks and there is a kiosk in the lobby that serves Starbucks coffee and pastries in the morning. There is also a gift store in the lobby for magazines, drinks, snacks etc. Also a Business Center here and kiosk for printing boarding passes. The room service seems reasonable at $16.50 for ham and eggs breakfast or $17.50 for continental breakfast, plus 15% service. The reason that I do not give this hotel five stars, is that there is no Starwood Club Lounge for free breakfast and evening appetizers. I think the location is not ideal, but suitable and you can easily get around. The CN Tower is within walking distance. Seems like the choices for restaurants may be limited if you want something within walking distance. Toronto is a very sustainable city and definitely someplace for foodies!

However, the room disappointed for many reasons. The first room we were assigned hadn't been made up yet. Back to the front desk. The second room had dirty bathroom floors, toothpaste in the sink, fingerprints all over the windows. Time Out Toronto described the rooms as \"light & spacious\" : ours was quite small and very dull. Loud inconsiderate neighbors because of a badly sound-proofed connecting door was the straw that broke the camel's back : back downstairs to the front desk to request a room change. Manager Aditya P. was very apologetic and immediately found us a better room; he also waived the charges for the Internet access and a phone call that had been made, a much appreciated attempt to soothe ruffled feathers. He also called to make sure the new (third) room was satisfactory. The Escape Package included breakfast for two in the Mizzen Dining Room: satisfactory but not outstanding. We realize cleaning rooms is monotonous and boring, but that's not a reason to cut corners nor take pride in one's work. A lot depends on the first impression and for many women, it makes all the difference between a return trip or not. True, front desk staff were efficient, but not particularly welcoming.

After my husband raised hell with this extremely nice man who was a maintenance person, we got one delivered for free, so thank you to this guy, sorry but i cant remember his name. On second thought, it was just the front desk staff and those freakin customer service agents or whatever they call themthat tell you a refrigerator that works will be 30 extra dollars a day that were annoying.

The call from our room asking valet to retrieve our cars is never relayed to valet and so we don't bother any more and ask for the vehicle at the outside lobby.

Not a question to switch us to a king room. There seemed to be a great number of staff people walking around, greeting you, asking if you needed anything. Hotel Ambassador, Rick Soloman made us feel so welcome our first night there. We stopped in the lobby bar for a bit and he came by to say hello and then proceeded to stay and talk to ensure that we knew of all of the events going on in town. One of the bar waiters, Danny, also made sure that we felt welcomed. My husband said we already felt at home on our first night in the hotel. The next night when we stopped at the bar because the bartender mixed a good drink, Danny waited until I tasted mine since there was a different bartender that night and he wanted to make sure that this one got it right. I would recommend dinner at the bar as opposed to the swanky top of the tower restaurant. Even though it is an open lobby bar, there are big window and lots of comfy seating as well as a lot of wait staff who all seemed very nice. The view from the fancy restaurant upstairs is great, but it wasn't anything too special. Some other guests who wanted to enjoy the view told us that they had dinner in the bar and then went up to the restaurant for champagne and dessert--that seems to be the way to go!

We chose the hotel based on the recommendation of a friend as well as familiarity with the Westin brand. The hotel is modern and located on Toronto\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s harbour-front. It is a quick taxi-ride from Toronto City Airport (Billy Bishop/YTZ), or, if you want to save the fare, you can take the Porter Airlines shuttle to the Royal York and walk the ten minutes to the hotel. Ferries to the Toronto Islands are directly behind the hotel, and there are a couple of places to eat within walking distance of the hotel (when asked where we could have breakfast, the concierge gave us a single option, circled it on a map, and went back to her computer). The views of the lake and islands are great, as is the outdoor terrace with tennis courts located off the pool area on the third floor. Our room looked out over the lake and islands. The blackout curtains effectively kept the room dark enough to sleep in broad daylight despite being directly on the lake. While the room was on the small side for North America, this did not particularly bother us. The staff at check-in and check-out were friendly and efficient. We frequently stay at Westins because they are reliably nice hotels with good service. The hotel\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s decorations are the Westin standard, but the fit/finish and cleanliness of our room left something to be desired. Some of the fixtures seemed to be coming loose on the ceiling and in the bathroom (the shower-head, for instance, wobbled against the wall). The shower-head was very low, even for someone below normal height. There was also dust on the upper shelf in the closet along with discarded laundry forms, and some of the bathroom fixtures looked like they had not been properly wiped-down when cleaned. The air conditioning unit is not particularly quiet, so we would recommend not setting it to \u00e2\u20ac\u0153auto\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd overnight. This is a very large hotel, and it was fully booked for at least part of our stay. This may have been behind the minor housekeeping issues, and we may have ended up with a room that would otherwise have been due for maintenance. Because the hotel was fully booked, I would have expected all of the check-in desks to be staffed mid-afternoon on Friday, but this was not the case. The result was a line-up (albeit one for which they seemed prepared by having airport-style queuing ropes set up) at check-in, though the staff was very pleasant and helpful. There was also a line-up for taxis in the afternoon outside the front door. This was our first stay at this hotel, and we expected better (based on our experience with the Westin brand). We might consider giving the Westin Harbour Castle another shot (though we would probably avoid it on busy holiday weekends) because the person who recommended it to us seems to have had a far better experience. We would also seriously consider returning to the Sheraton Centre, which is more centrally located and provided a better guest experience than the typical Sheraton.", "Date": "September 6, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Sleep Quality": "2", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "2", "Service": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Toronto, Canada", "Title": "\u201cOvernight stay maybe back ?\u201d", "Author": "sarshark", "ReviewID": "UR117752288", "Content": "Even though it was the friday of a long week-end, the staff were extremely friendly and courteous.

Only complaint about room was that we were right by the elevator and heard it ALL night long! Be sure to turn the fan on at night so you don`t hear the AC every time it turns on at night. Parking: We opted for the valet parking (pricey at $40) but was a better option than trying to locate the offsite self-park and have to navigate through all the pedestrian traffic in the area. Even the self park was pricey at $30. The valet has in and out privileges and they were very prompt each time we needed the vehicle. They were very kind (as they should be at $40 a day) and let us keep the car there for a few hours extra. Price: Be sure to shop around.

We chose this hotel primarily for the location, as the ferry docks are just a couple of steps away, and we wanted something nice. We didn't book the wedding rate through the hotel, but we ended up getting a great deal through hotels.ca, and directed our guests to do the same. I would easily say that we would have been just as happy if we had paid the full price. The Westin really took care of all of us. As most of our guests were coming in from out of town, we wanted to arrange a meeting spot and have a couple of drinks with them before the big day. My girls and I must have called like 10 bars to find out if they would do a private area for us, what the set up was, how much bottle service would be, etc. Nothing was working. Then I contacted the Westin directly, and talked to Erin Haid. Erin was awesome. She basically listened to everything I needed, and put together a package for me. I was a bit skeptical about the bar area being in the lobby, but when we actually saw it, it was perfect. It was right by the doors, with signage directing \"Cyr Wedding\" guests to meet there, the bottle service was beautifully set up on it's own table, and we had a roped off area with lots of lounge-style seating, so it totally gave us a VIP feel. When we checked in (which we were given an early check in with no problems at all), we were given an upgrade, a corner room with a beautiful lakeview. The guests were all able to find the ferry docks and get to the wedding without any problems at all. **Break for my amazing wedding** My HUSBAND(!!!) and I returned back to the hotel late at night after the wedding to find a lovely bottle of champagne and a plate of chocolate covered strawberries!! ERIN, was that you?? There was no card or anything and no one I knew said they had gifted us with this so presumably the hotel did. I swear, I did not pull any \"this is my wedding!\" B.S. with any of the staff; I didn't ask for anything!! We ordered pizza (haha) off the late night menu, which was prompt and SO DELICIOUS. The next morning, when we were saying bye to my NEW IN LAWS (!!!), a manager came by and congratulated us (again, I have no idea how they knew we just got married, but it seemed like all the staff knew?) and asked us about our stay, etc., and then asked if the kids wanted to make some paper flower bouquets at the craft station (no charge). They were ecstatic about that and it gave the adults an extra moment to say our goodbyes. In short, this hotel provided an amazing experience for us and our out-of-town wedding guests.

The hotel is not directly downtown but it is a very short walk to the Union subway station. It`s only about a 5 minute walk to the Hockey Hall of Fame which was a lot of fun. Right on the waterfront it was great to walk along and look at all the boats on the water. If you take the escalators from the lobby up a level there is a small patio which offers great views of the waterfront. The room as expected was very comfortable, clean, and well appointed. I had a room on the 30th floor since I had asked for a high floor. I unfortunately did not get the greatest view however. The room was located in the South Tower but was facing East so the view was limited to a bit of the lake and not much else. Since I will for sure return the next time I will ask for a North Tower room which seems to be the better place to be in for city views. The parking is 40$ valet or 30$ self park. We decided to park somewhere else and actually ended up in the lot were the Westin self park option is. It is a multilevel underground lot. If you fellow the signs to the Westin side it will take you to the bottom of the lot and they will charge you 30$. However I simply parked in the other level of the same lot and ended up paying 22$ for the same lot! So long story short don`t bother going to the Westin side and you`ll save some money.

The lakefront location was very nice, and we had a partial lake view without paying more for it. There were enough places to eat nearby that we never had to eat in the hotel. If you skip housekeeping, the hotel will give you a $5 voucher for each day you do, good at some but not all of the plaes in the hotel. The valet parking was expensive ($40/night) but quick to produce your car when asked. You had to pay for in-room Internet access if you wanted it, but if you went to the lobby the staff would give you a password good for a free hour of wireless access, and I was told you could get another if one hour wasn't enough. The signage for getting where you needed to be at the convention was inadequate, but I'm not sure whether that was the hotel or the organization holding the convention. Overall, we had a good experience, and would go back if we got a good enough rate, but if there was a Drury or Hampton nearby we would probably go there instead, because I think you get more from them for less money.", "Date": "August 10, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Edinburgh", "Title": "\u201cLovely hotel in blissful waterfront location - we will be back!\u201d", "Author": "G4L", "ReviewID": "UR116465373", "Content": "Me and my Wife stayed here for 7 nights as part of our honeymoon in late July/early August, and cant fault the hotel at all really. The hotel is right on the harbour front of Downtown Toronto. The main shopping areas and restaurants are all within a 15 - 20minute walk from the hotel. There is also a taxi rank right outside the lobby. Staff were always friendly and knowledgable when approached, although we did get a couple of random visits from staff for laundry and the occasionl random phone call to our room. There is a little shop in the hotel in the North tower, has your basics like bottled water, soft drinks, crisps, chocolate, painkillers etc, however the prices are pretty expensive. We had dinner twice in the hotel, both times was very good. Again prices are expensive, but certainly worth it. We ventured up to the Toula restaurant on the top floor of the South Tower one evening, but were told we could not have just drinks there, which was a little disappointing. Our room was on the 7th floor, had a slight sea view, partnered with a street view. Street noise varied from this floor. Our room was lovely and spacious, 2 double beds. Bathroom modern and spacious too. Cleaners every day, unless request not. Hotel does a good green incentive, which you can obtain voucher rewards if you refuse the cleaners each day. You get a $5 dollar voucher to use on food/drinks within the hotel. We used this a couple of times to pay for breakfast at their coffee bar downstairs. The hotel also has great sports facilities, a large heated pool, big enough for about 10 - 15 families. It has a basketball court, tennis/squash court, fitness suite. My Wife used the fitness suite who said it was pretty good. The pool was always nice and warm, and not too busy when we used it. There is also a very large plasma TV on the poolside if you get bored swimming :) Over all this hotel was great, and we loved staying there.", "Date": "August 9, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "3", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Vancouver, Canada", "Title": "\u201cComfortable Stay\u201d", "Author": "Formiga", "ReviewID": "UR116450076", "Content": "Went for business in July and it happened to fall on the Caribana Fest.

LOCATION: If you plan to spend your time in the hotel, the harbor location makes for lovely views.

AMENITIES: There is a full gym that was really quite nice - could have been a more comfortable temperature but I appreciated the full range of free weights and equipment. The pool area is also large and user-friendly. Although prevalent in so many luxury hotels, I find the pay wireless internet service appalling. It's 2011 - wireless internet should be free. SERVICE: The staff is very kind and courteous and they promptly helped me with some special items I needed, like a real refrigerator. The concierge staff was not very knowledgeable about the larger city, but I think those days of the brilliant concierge may be gone.

There is a good food shop across the street which has both gourmet prepared foods and snacks and is open until midnight. The room was an internet bargain. I am someone who likes his creature comforts and likes to make sure that his partner finds the accommodation I have chosen to be of high quality. The Harbour Castle more than fit the bill. The internet is $17 per day and the parking is $30 self-service or $40 for the valet service. I understand that there are other parking lots nearby that charge substantially less. The only annoying thing seems to be the hotel General Manager's attempt to make a comment on every review. This is boring and repetitive.

We were placed in the south tower on the 24th floor, and delighted to find that our room had both the promised city view (looking left out the window) and also a beautiful view of the harbour (looking to the right). The best of both worlds! The room itself was clean and bright with a modern decor. The location of the hotel is great for those wanting to visit the Toronto Islands, as the ferry dock is just steps away from the entrance. It was also an easy walk (15 minutes) to the Rogers Centre. The Air Canada Centre is five minutes away on foot. Staff were fantastic. We have nothing but positive things to say about the attitudes of the valets, the front desk, the fitness area workers, and the Mizzen staff. They made us feel pampered and above all, very welcome. A small issue with our breakfast voucher (our son was not included as we reserved) was remedied by the front desk efficiently and with a smile. The recreational facilities were bright and had a great view of the harbour. The pool was large and comfortably warm. The hot tub could have used more powerful (and more plentiful) jets, but it was nice and hot. There's a great kids play area adjacent to the pool for those wee ones not wanting to swim, and a flat screen tv on the wall at one end of the pool for \"dive-in movies\". The outdoor recreation area has a great tennis court, chairs for lounging in the sun, and a basketball area in need of some TLC (and a new net). Internet access is outrageously priced and was the one of the few disappointments of our visit. We chose to forego internet access and leave the lap-top turned off as the price did not justify the convenience. The charge for toll-free calls was a second disappointment, as a phone call via my calling card would still have run me up in extra charges.

The Executive Suite has an \"entertaining space\" connected to two rooms on either side. The entertaining space has two couches, two wingback chairs and a large dining table with seating for six. This suite is also complete with its own powder room and a wet bar for making drinks for your guests. The adjoining bedroom was decorated in a more classic style, heavenly beds and a flat screen television.The rooms on the 34th floor command an amazing view of Lake Ontario and the Toronto skyline. I had some friends over to this space for some drinks and they were all very impressed with the location and the view. We felt like rock stars. We ordered four rounds of room service during our stay and the food was everything that I have come to expect of the Westin: promptly delivered and tasty! The gentleman who delivered the food was very welcoming and friendly. While I was in the elevator one of the security staff recognized me from my last stay in November and welcomed me back to the property. She even remembered where I was from!

Here's the thing though- what is up with the housekeeping at this property? It was literally the worst housekeeping I have ever experienced at ANY starwood property- bar none. Here are my examples: 1. Iron in room didn't work- put a note on it \"Iron Doesn't Work\"- came back after they had been in- Iron was still there- still didn't work. Called housekeeping, had them bring up a new Iron- old Iron remained on our table for the next two days. 2. Our shampoo/conditioner wasn't replaced 2/3 days, despite the fact that the empty used, bottle were placed in the bathroom trash. 3. Coffee was used in the morning, and not replaced. Generally speaking, every day it looked like the only cleaning that happened was that the bed was made- poorly, I might add.

We booked through Priceline...... which makes me believe that our experience was because we were not paying full price to stay at the hotel. We often use hotwire/priceline to book hotels as we are both students - yet we have never experienced inferior service. We attended the Blue Jays game Friday night and went to check in to the hotel around 10:30 PM. When we went up to our room, we saw that there were dirty towels lying everywhere around the bathroom floor. There was also a room key on the TV unit in the bedroom. However, the bed was completely made...and there was no luggage in the room. Thus, this leads me to believe that either A) our room was not completely cleaned.... or B) someone had been occupying the room. We called the front desk and we were immediately \"upgraded\" to another room. We went to our new room. It was clean; however, the only upgrade was the view (it overlooked the water instead of the street). It was the same small room. I was utterly shocked. This is how they were going to make it up to us after what just happened? My boyfriend called to complain and the manager told us that we already got an upgrade .She also explained that no one was staying in the room... they probably just forgot to clean it (UHH...THE BED WAS FULLY MADE with the \"green\" sign on it...and the rest of the room was ok). Also, being 10PM and the fact that we were just using the room to sleep as we had baseball games and shows planned, the view was not much of a compensation for their terrible mistake. In order to make us happy they did give us free buffet breakfast and the vouchers would be sent up... after 45 mins (nearly midnight), the vouchers were no where. We actually had to call back and ask if we were getting the vouchers or if we just go down to breakfast in the morning and get them there. 20 mins later, they were shoved under our door. It was like they did not want to deal with us and just wanted us to get off their backs.

Arrived on a Monday night and left Thursday morning. For a 4 star hotel, I was quite disappointed with certain elements. I have traveled extensively over the US and Canada and stayed in various hotel establishment usually in a 3 to 5 star range. Issues: - For a room that was booked for 2 people in a double bed room, you would expect to have more than one small conditioner bottle and one small shampoo bottle on the first night. We didn't make a fuss thinking they would provide us with a new set the following day. However, as our stay progressed we gained an extra bottle of shampoo on night 2 and an extra bottle of conditioner on night 3. The soap bars were not renewed or exchange at anytime. - On our first night, the bedsheets were still a little damp and were quite wrinkly. Saw some mystery hair was a little weary but too tired to deal with it. Placed the sign on the bed to renew all bed sheets. Sheets were renewed and opted not to renew sheets for following evening. - Most frustrating experience was with their concierge service. I have never been so disappointed. Our first day in Toronto, we inquired what there was to do in a 3-4 hour window before our dinner reservations. We were told we could check out some shows and then he provided (forgot name) a sheet with things to do. Instead of inquiring of our interest, he just handed us the sheet. I had asked about the Tim Burton exhibit and he said we could find it at the Bell Tiff Lightbox and showed us how to get there...EXCEPT when we arrived there, found out the exhibit had ended the day before. He also suggested we go to the box office to see if we can purchase tickets to the Lion King, another FAIL, the box office was closed on Monday. So we pretty much wandered to the Entertainment district to waste time. At that rate, we could have just walked to the Eaton Centre and done some shopping at least. All in all, I would probably never use their concierge service at this particular hotel. - For a 4 star, you would expect them to have decent umbrellas as loaners. I've been in 4 stars where they provide you excellent umbrellas for rainy days. We were given broken umbrellas during our stay and decided to spend another 20$ each on buying some umbrellas that were not defective. My friend put it perfectly - it's like they gave us Dollarama (dollar store) umbrellas. - No free wi-fi in room. Complimentary 1hr wifi/day available in the Lobby. - Walls were pretty thin, spent one night listening to our neighbors yell at eachother until 2am. And could hear flushing noises above us at all hours. Positive side: - The food in the restaurant lobby was on the more expensive side (as usual) but it was delicious. - The service in the restaurant/bar at the lobby was outstanding. - Was able to check-in at an earlier time without any extra charge and under short notice. - They are really trying to stay green by offering various initiatives such as refusing turn down service and not exchanging sheets etc etc. I booked this hotel through Hotwire at a discounted rate. I would never pay regular price for the room we were given and I wouldn't recommend anybody book it at the rate they are requesting.

He advised us Valet parking was $40 a night and there is a parking lot one block away for $25 on Queens Quay W. My husband dropped me off and actually found $10/ night parking on the corner of Queens Quay W and Yonge Street. Just head up Yonge Street towards Harbour Street and it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s on your right side. Once he returned, our check in was fast, painless and the lady that helped us (Noor) was so nice. She gave us the option between Queens or King bed. She gave us our keys and said if we get up there and we have any issues, contact her (she jotted her extenstion down) and she gave us the time she is there till. We headed up to our room, we had a very nice view, we were on the 18th floor. The room was very nice and clean. Our fridge didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t work but, we weren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t using it anyways so we didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t bother complaining. The bath products they use (soaps, cream\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6.etc) are quality. The bathroom has enough lighting, a large bathroom mirror and a make up mirror. Also, they have a full sized conair hair dryer ladies!!! The bed was sooo comfortable and the room was nice and cool. The air conditioner was a tiny bit loud to sleep with, so we just turned it down to \u00e2\u20ac\u0153low\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd and we survived. That night we went out to a show and when we came back, we sat in the lobby lounge. We wanted to have a snack. We sat down with a drink and started looking over the menu\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6.*gasp* $$$$$$$$$ So, as a tip, order pizza or order something to the hotel\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6.because you don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t want to eat at the hotel\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6unless you don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t mind paying $20 for an appetizer.

The fabulous menus offered during the conference and the updated rooms at the Westin Harbour Castle made this conference a step above your usual Toronto conference. When we made the reservation, we wanted to make sure that all seven rooms were on teh same floor of the hotel, as some of the women travelling with us wouldn't be comfortable being away from everyone in another section of the hotel. While this was not appearing to be available when we first arrived, (nor did the first front desk clerk think there was anything she could do to solve this problem), when prevailed upon, one of the other clerks stepped up and managed to make it happen, which was much appreciated. The views from the 30th floor were amazing! There were first rate views from all the rooms occupied by our party. The sunrise in the eastern facing rooms was spectacular, as were the views for those facing the city CN tower and the lake. The rooms have obviously been upgraded and redecorated. They are stylish and sophisticated, as well as comfortable. The chaise lounge was the perfect place to relax. The beds were divine - everyone was well rested and ready to work. The bar in the stylish lobby was a great meeting place. The servers were very prompt and friendly. Parking was the only downside to our stay. Valet parking was too expensive at $40. The first night I opted for self-park ($25), but that was inconvenient; I had to park a block away in the underground lot of a condo building that was under construction. One of the other women in my party had to accompany me so I wouldn't be in the underground parking or on the street alone after dark. The second night, I decided to pay up and use the valet service so that my vehicle would be adjacent to the lobby and it would be easy for everyone to load up their belongings in the morning.

BEWARE THE HIDDEN COSTS OF A SECURITY DEPOSIT anywhere from $50.00 if you use a credit card, and up to $200.00 in cash to be held until your departure. In my case with the Westin Harbour Castle in Toronto. I had called in advance, to ensure I had everything covered (since using a pre-paid credit card) I wanted to make sure I had the PROPER AMOUNT OF FUNDS, to cover everything with the hotel. They messed up in telling me that as long as my credit card went through and paid for the room, there would be no added charges. (In this economy BUDGETING for me is essential, and there is hardly any extra) So when this happened to me I so embarrassed and DO NOT WANT IT TO HAPPEN TO ANYONE ELSE!!! WESTIN HARBOUR CASTLE, TORONTO, with there miss-informed information to me, REGARDING SECURITY DEPOSITS caused unnecessary embarrassment at the Front Desk. You know the front desk even asked if there wasn't someone I could call to bring me money? Can you believe that! Instead of trying to accommodate me first as a client who had already PAID for the room in full, and try to work out a solution first with the hotel, they suggested I impose on family or friends to bring me money to cover the SECURITY DEPOSIT, rather than themselves, when they were the cause of the situation.Having only $100.00 Spending money for my weekend, they took $40.00, which they used to cover the SECURITY DEPOSIT!!! That was their solution, not to waive the fee, but to take as much of my money I could spare for that weekend, and they did. IF YOU PAY FOR YOUR ROOM IN ADVANCE AND DON'T HAVE ANY $$$ ON CREDIT OR IN CASH FOR THE SECURITY DEPOSIT, THEY WILL NOT LET YOU HAVE THE ROOM AND YOU WILL BE OUT THE $$$ YOU PAY FOR THE ROOM, ALL BECAUSE OF Not being informed of A SECURITY DEPOSIT (Which is non-negotiable with the Hotel) AND NOT MENTIONED ON THE WEBSITE. No Security Deposit. NO ROOM. (even if you've already paid for it) The room was dusty, I wrote the word 'DIRTY\" in the dust on the dresser, and left it there. For a $289.00 per night for this room.....I at least expected it to be dusted, not to mention find a smudge of something on the main comforter. FOR A SUPPOSEDLY FOUR DIAMOND HOTEL..........IT SUCKED.

I received a rate on Hotwire of $125 per night which I thought was a great deal. Unfortunately, the costs of internet and food made that price rise dramatically which will make me rethink my choice of hotel in the future. The lobby is very nice and well-maintained, although no one seemed to realize that the random assortment of tables and chairs smack dab in the middle of the lobby is actually the restaurant. The food there is unfortunately pretty mediocre with a hefty price tag. I sampled their burger (which is NOT good, the meat looks very weirdly colored... I don't know if I'm just not used to Canadian meat or what, but it was not good). The fries they have, however, are really yummy. Due to my schedule, I usually had to resort to heading back to the hotel for dinner so didn't have many options. I quickly learned that since nothing was that great, it was best to just order from the Childrens Menu so I wasn't paying an arm and a leg. Their chicken fingers were the best thing I ordered. Also, steer clear of ordering drinks through room service - a can of coke thats a couple of dollars in the lobby costs FIVE DOLLARS through room service. Outrageous. My room was on the 34th floor in the South Tower. I highly recommend that you try for the north tower as my room overlooked a construction site that was definitely an eyesore. The room itself was very clean and nice. The bed and pillows were comfy, and it was nice to have a wall-mounted tv that could be moved when I sat at the desk eating dinner. I was put in an adjoining room, and every time my neighbor sneezed I could hear him. They could be better at insulating sound in adjoining rooms. The bathroom was clean and well-maintained.... but very small. You open the door and its about 1 inch away from the toilet, so even if you are by yourself you have to shut the door while using the restroom or the door will hit your knees. There were plenty of toiletries provided (though not restocked) including shampoo, conditioner, soap, lotion and mouthwash. There was also a robe but after one use, housekeeping did not leave it in the room or provide a new one. Housekeeping was good at the start of the week and wasn't the best towards the end. They weren't bad per say, but they would move some things while they cleaned and then forget to put them back in place when they were done... but it wasn't anything major. It was nice to have the little 'Starbucks' cafe (though the may brew Starbucks coffee, they are not properly trained on how to make latte drinks, that's for sure). They have pastries, fruit, coffee and beverages available (though a little expensive, but to be expected at a hotel). Though I always tipped the ladies, I felt like they weren't very friendly to me, yet there would be other customers who were staying at the hotel for a conference and the ladies would gush over them and call them by name. When I booked the hotel on Hotwire, I purposely selected one with a Business Center and Wifi. The hotel offers you 60 minutes of wifi use for free in the lobby (which is consecutive, not actual time used, so from the minute you log on your time is winding down). After that, the wifi rates are astronomical. You would be paying their monthly bill by paying for any of the daily/weekly rates. So the have a Business Center, which I planned on using so I wouldn't have to pay for wifi. My assumption of it being free comes with the inconvenience of using a public computer that is located only in the basement of the north tower. But the prices they charge for that internet are just as ridiculous! So after one use that was absolutely necessary, I avoided the internet altogether. When I received my bill this morning, I noticed I was charged almost $5 for an \"in-room internet\" charge... which isn't even possible, considering I purposely avoided using the Wifi, not to mention that in order to access the internet, you have to log into their system first. So I will be calling them to have this situation fixed. Overall, the Westin is not a bad hotel. There are plenty of taxis lined up ready to take you where you want to go, and I'm sure its a lovely location when the weather is nice. But given that I was travelling on business and their internet prices were ridiculously priced, I probably would not stay here again on a business trip unless they offered some better wifi packages. For a personal stay, I probably would stay if the rate was more like $100/night on Hotwire.", "Date": "March 25, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Sleep Quality": "4", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "3", "Location": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "New York City, New York", "Title": "\u201cLousy room, disgusting bathroom\u201d", "Author": "ihgelap", "ReviewID": "UR101453354", "Content": "Stayed here for couple nights (because we couldn't extend our stays at Sheraton Center hotel).

I had reserved a terrace room w/double beds a couple weeks before my arrival but instead they told me that due to how busy the hotel was I had to get a terrace room w/one king. So, why did I make the reservation for? Also, I had requested a fridge and microwave the day before over the phone and I felt that should have been in the room prior to my arrival, but we had to wait for it. I told the rep at the front and then I had to call the front desk again later before I received them, as well as a roll-away bed for the other guest in my room (since my reservation wasn't kept). I was given a guest of the day package which included free vouchers for internet and breakfast, which was nice. But, the front desk rep forgot to give it to me and they had to deliver that also to my room, after I called the front desk. The breakfast had a great selection except the breakfast meats were all under one buffet dish, which isn't good for those with religious sensitivities (ex: chicken and pork in the same dish). Also, the almond croissants were too close to the butter ones, and this could bother people with nut allergies. And $9.60 for a Corona? Am I getting served in a gold cup? What about $40 valet? Are they cleaning my car and doing an oil change? Lucky for me I got dropped off. On a positive note, the hotel and rooms were very clean, no bed bugs or vermin, with comfy (but not exceptional) beds and furniture. The balcony was a nice addition.

This hotel is ideally located if you want to be handy to everything but isolated from the noise of downtown, as it is located on the waterfront. The only real noise you hear is the occasion street noise and planes taking off from the Toronto Island airport. Staff at this hotel were extremely accommodating to myself and my brother during our stay. Our trip started off a little rough as my brother had a medical situation on approach to the Toronto Island airport which required us to be at the hospital for most of the night. We checked in at 3:30am and I explained to the front desk clerk why we were late. First he inquired about my brother's well being and made sure we had everything we needed and if he could get anything for us. He went even further to invite us to order some room service free of charge so we could get something to eat after our ordeal. I thought this was an incredibly nice gesture and this attention to customer service is something that I have experienced at many Westins in Canada. Our room had two double beds and the decor had bene updated semi recently. The beds were comfortable as always. The bathrooms had been updated partially with new vanities and toilets but the older style bathtub remained. For me this isn't a big deal as I'm not really a bath person. Our room was on a corner so we had a view the air canada centre and Royal York on one side and a partial harbour view on the other side. Westin has changed their menus around a little bit since I was at this property last to a more spa/well being focused menu. We ordered room service breakfast (eggs and sausage and belgian waffles). I found the breakfast to be great. Many of the ingredients were organic or locally sourced and the flavours were great in the hashbrowns, sausage and eggs. We spent the day shopping and the evening attending our concert. When we returned there was a serious problem with our room. I called down to the front desk when we noticed it, around 12:00am, and the response was immediate. A night manager and security staff came to our room and moved our luggage into a new room that didn't have this issue. The total turnaround time was very quick. I was impressed with this as there were many events in the hotel that event (holiday parties, etc.) that many of the staff were occupied with. For our trouble, we were sent a fruit and cheese platter with a hand written note apologizing for the inconvenience. I felt this was very nice. In the morning, we had the buffet breakfast in the Mizzen restaurant. The selection is excellent and the value is great for the amount of choice you have ($20.00 per person).

In an instance, the centrally located Westin was moved from its prime downtown location to a lakefront location. Gone was the quick access to Toronto\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s heart.

Though the hotel has excellent access to the harbour front\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s many amenities, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s location away from the main shopping and entertainment areas might frazzle some. The hotel is typical of a Westin. The hotel\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s spacious and contemporary lobby welcomes guests upon their arrival. Guest rooms are located in both the south and north towers. South facing rooms have beautiful views of Lake Ontario and the Toronto Islands, which are accessible by the ferryboats that depart from just behind the hotel. North facing rooms have wonderful views of Toronto\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s CN Tower, the Rogers Centre (Skydome), the soaring steel and glass pinnacles of the financial districts. The contemporary styled guest rooms are done in earthly shades of taupe and brown with accents of green. Bathrooms echo the same style and colours. A large wall-to-wall window embraces each room. And of course, the Heavenly Bed, which feels like sleeping on a cloud. The hotel only offers valet parking at $40 per night. Off-street parking is available off site for $25 per night.

The hotel is situated between Bay and Yonge Streets. It is a 30 minute walk to the Entertainment Section.

You can do this at Union Square station which is a 10 minute walk to Front Street. I have to compliment the hotel management since we had an incident involving our room the second night. The manager of the hotel and maintenance person appeared at our door after our phone complaint within 5 minutes. Right away they told us to pack and they would send a bell man to take us to a new room. Little did we know we would be upgraded to the 35th floor to a large suite reserved for celebrity status. It was as large as an apartment. Kudos for taking care of your patrons I suggest when you go to take a look around if you are on a budget for Breakfast. The area does have a cafe just down from the hotel going West on Harbor Street quite reasonable. Also right a across the street is the Waterfront Deli that offers $5.99 Breakfast. Not fancy by a long shot but if does the trick. I found parking simple enough. Just use the self part for $25.00 night which is an enclosed lot. I think Valet is just too expensive at $40.00 a night.

First, on the positive side, the hotel is in a good location and is within walking distance of the the Toronto business district and many tourist attractions including the Air Canada Centre, the CN Tower, the Hockey Hall of Fame, etc. Some of the rooms have nice views and the fitness center was nice. Unfortunately, these positives were outweighed by the negatives. The room was not very clean and had not one but two live spiders in the bathroom along with an assortment of dead bugs (mostly gnats) on the desk. The service was very poor. I called twice and visited the front desk twice to get an issue corrected with the room and it was never addressed although I was given mutliple assurances that it would be. The hallways and room were dark, making it difficult to work and the air conditioner was very noisy. While I was in a \"junior suite\" the room was no bigger than most hotel rooms and the combination bath/shower was on the small side.

Didn't get my SPG Gold upgrade, but to be fair there was a convention at the hotel and it was fully booked. My only real complaint was the hotel seemed to be a bit rough around the edges... the halls, elevators, and public areas seemed worn and dated. The room was lovely enough - spacious and decent lighting. I had an issue with the hairdryer and it was rectified immediately and with a smile. There were only 3 toiletries in room though - shampoo, conditioner, and lotion. The shower pressure was rubbish as well... had to stand there ages to wash and rinse hair. Load of channels on the TV. No minibar, but a fridge to cool drinks bought at the \"airport store\" in the lobby. There was a coffee maker in the room as well. The biggest reason I gave this an \"average\" was that the beds did NOT seem like the \"Heavenly Beds\" I'm used to at a Westin - the sheets weren't that nice, the bed was rock hard, and the pillows just average. Seriously, I'm not that fussy, but this is the MAIN reason I book Westins every time - I know I'm going to get a fabulous night's rest. That was just not the case at this location (and I've stayed loads and all beds seemed to be cut from the same cloth.) I almost complained, but seriously what was I going to say... \"your beds seem different from other Westins??\" I kept quiet.

PC's where extremely slow and Internet outrageously expensive. Breakfast Buffet was ok - but nothing special. One thing that did bug me though was how dirty everything was. The restaurant was very busy and the Buffet was very poorly maintained. For example, Butter was served in a big bowl and People where all using the same knife to butter their Toast while at the Buffet. Not really clean and looked dirty. Refilling of the buffet was very slow and Cereal station was always very messy with Cereal all over the place.

The Harbour Castle charges $45.00 for valet ($25.00 self park) and $30.00 for the breakfast buffet if you don't buy the package.

I told them I wanted self parking. They said it would be $125 up front. I told them maybe I would just park 1 night at their facility and maybe tomorrow I would find a cheaper place and park there for the other 4 days. Immediately the valet office person started whispering... \"I will give you the self park rate for valet parking\" So I got $25/night valet parking.

The only complain about the room is the loud (and I mean very loud A/C) I recommend setting it to run very cold all day long and when you come to your room turn it off and sleep as fast as possible. There is no way to watch TV when A/C is on. Which really wasn't a problem for us. The junior suite was decent size. We skipped the room service for 2 nights. I was hoping that I would skip it for 1 night and get the $5 credit and use it at the bar for a beer. But the flier fails to mention that the $5 food and beverage credit can not be used for alcohol pruchase. But I used it for 500 spg points. The pool is very little but serves the purpose after dark. The hotel is in a nice location but feels left out after dark. Overall good hotel. Can't comment on the value as I used the cash and points. Platinum members get a bottle of water daily (Yeay!!!!)

We stayed outside for a short time, with other travellers in their PJ's, and with sleeping kids in their arms. No one came out, or made an annoucement about what was going on.

We discussed various hotels and I shared our experience with the Westin Harbour Castle as well as a couple of other hotels. She encouraged me to post my complaints and compliments. So here is my experience from the WHC from March 19-21, 2010. My family and I stayed here for a couple of nights back at the end of March. We had 3 rooms, we all share the same last name. However, my parents arrived before us and were not allowed to check the rest of us in. My brother, sister, brother-in-law and five year old had all spent several hours driving all day and were looking forward to relaxing as soon as we got to the hotel. Relaxing is not the right word to describe this hotel. It is busy, but that's ok. It would be nice if the staff were as friendly as other hotels. It would be nice if they wouldn't argue with you. It would be nice if they didn't have fire alarms going off in the middle of the night which meant carrying a very sick 5 year old down several flights of stairs. We were told our 5 year old did not need to pay for the King Tut exhibit. But then we were told we had to buy her a shuttle ticket to get her there. Nowhere in the ad for the King Tut package did it say that children under 5 were free EXCEPT when they take the shuttle. I was so fed up with the fellow arguing about it that I said we would rather take a cab than pay for something that is supposed to be free. He then relented and said she could go on. When we were on the shuttle, there were other 5 year old's there whose parents did not have someone who argued with them about buying a ticket for the 5 year old. Why were their 5 year old's free but mine was not? When my dad checked in, he was told that he could access their internet without an extra charge. Later, when he tried to access it, he was told there was a charge. Again, more discussion and we finally didn't use it because all the wrangling to get it put us off and I had found a hotspot anyways. At other hotels, internet is included which is much nicer and way more civilized. Then to top it all off, a fire alarm went off in the middle of the night. My poor daughter had caught a cold and had become more sick that night. She had only just gotten to sleep and then the alarm went off. I had to carry her and a box of tissue down all those stairs. I know that the hotel had little control over the fire alarm, but it was just the straw the broke the camel's back. There are much better hotels in Toronto and they are much friendlier, provide complimentary internet, free papers, breakfast and coffee. We prefer to stay at Hampton Inn and Homewood Suites.

Got a basic upgrade to a nice room overlooking lake ontario as usual given to platinum members. Room quality and the hotel is standard for westin hotels which is above average overall. The only hiccup on this trip was when the a/c died around 1am and still wasn't fixed by the time I checked out around noon time. I called the front desk to see if they knew why the room was so hot and they mentioned that a \"chiller\" went down that night and was in the process of being repaired. While I was fine with the warmer temperature over night, it did get a bit uncomfortable during the morning while in the room. For me the experience was a bit embarrassing, as I was travelling with my Sifu and wife visiting from Thailand who is used to top quality hotels and rooms (which I did get in the Westin Trillium and Sheraton on the Falls for 3 nights). He kept mentioning how he and the wife couldn't sleep well and that top hotels would never have such a problem and not comp or apologize in some way. Led to a big philosophical debate on blame and responsibility for what a hotel is obligated to provide for the hotel rate paid. I tried defending the Starwood side for a while as I couldn't blame any hotel for an unexpected breakdown, but after a while I do feel like the stay was compromised somewhat for my room and more so for my friends in the other room as a/c is always one of the most important requirements towards a satisfactory stay. Maybe i'll contact corporate in a few days, but if it weren't for my friends in the other room who keep telling me how upset they were, i'd probably just ignore it as bad luck (unless of course they still didn't fix the a/c if i were staying a 2nd day).", "Date": "July 18, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "San Francisco", "Title": "\u201cThe worst housekeeping of any hotel I have ever stayed in\u201d", "Author": "Travel Richly", "ReviewID": "UR70211410", "Content": "It was surprising to find this large, impersonal and poorly managed hotel to be a Westin.

The view can only be described as spectacular, as we were also on a corner, giving views right across Lake Ontario and Toronto Islands from one window, whilst turning to the other gave a panorama of the city with the CN Tower in full view.

It's easy to see why the Westin Harbour was chosen to accommodate such high-profile dignitaries, and we were made to feel as important as them.

Such a wonderful thank you for my Starwood loyalty. As such, the hotel is OK--as clean and sterile as modern high-rise hotels get--but with little in the way of give for the guest. Business centre internet was 25 cents a minute. Extra one-cup coffee packets were offered for sale instead of free. I got hit with a $5 charge for processing an outbound fedex package. The bed, as usual was great, and seemed with the shower to be the only things included in the price--even the concierge seemed unusually keen to be the one to sell me the attraction tickets (he was helpful, so I obliged, even though I didn't want to give the hotel the extra money in the process.)

Both Westins (at Montreal and Toronto) are great value for money (because of their birth year promotion). Overall The hotel lobby is modern and clean. I like the design and they have a bar and small Starbucks outlet that serves very limited range of pastries and drinks. But the security is questionable. Anyone can just go to the elavator and go up to any floors. Unlike the Westin Montreal which you need your card key to press the button in the elavators, the Westin Toronto does not have that security feature. It is an important feature especially their bar seems to be a very popular joint with hotel guests and locals. It was crowded every night when I was there for three nights. And the lifts look old. Room The room is big. Like the one in Montreal, it was big enough for my four large suitcases wand enough room for me to walk around without tipping over any furniture. The room is clean and the design is modern and well design. Basically, it suits my taste in design asthetics. And also, my corner room oversees the lake and city. That's a plus point. Amenities Other than the soap, shampoo and hair conditioner, you have to call the housekeeping and ask basic stuff such as a cotton ball! I find this very absurd! And also, these days, people would prefer to use shower gel instead of soap. So that really irked me when I was staying there. No complimentary Wifi They don't even have complimentary wifi in the hoitel lobby! Check your bill Even though I've reserved my room under the Birth Year promotion on its website. I was charged the full rates when I was checking out. If I did not go through the entire bill, I would have been over charged by Westin. The staff told me that the staff who checked me in failed to indicate it when I checked into the hotel. I find it unexceptable when my reservation indicated so. Staff are not friendly at all Generally, I find the service staff in Toronto rather unfriendly. This is unlike Montreal where most of the people that I've encountered are very polite and friendly. The ladies at the Starbucks outlet in Westin Toronto looked sulky and they are just there to take orders. They are not service oriented at all. The staff at the bar is similar as well. Great sporting facilities The gym is comprehensive. The treadmills face the lake which is nice if you are not keen in watching the TV in front of you. The pool is definitely much bigger than the one in Westin Montreal but they only blocked one lane for the lap swimming. The major part of the pool is occupied by children! Hence, if someone is doing his/ her laps in the reserved lane, you will have to fight for some space with the children. There is a hot pool just besides the main pool. In the changing room, there are steam room and sauna. I like these features. Not all hotels provide them. Expensive parking Don't park at the hotel. It's bloody expensive. The next available place to park which is a walking distance is $25 per day. However, you should check out the nearby places if you have the time. Apparently, you can get cheap parking (where Westin direct their clients to park) at a lower rate. Subway It's very accessible from the hotel.

As such I can honestly say ...\"I'm Spoiled\" and appreciate the finest service standards around. I arrived at the hotel around 4pm exhausted from a multi city trip week and having to preapre for a Breast Cancer Awareness function that was to start at 6pm. I unpacked and found my wrinkled pink shirt and backup blue one so wrinkled that the thought of ironing them brought my already exhausted state of mind even more so exhausted. I called Housekeeping and got Gloria Huang on the line who understood my predicament and although their in house laundry services were closed for the night, she immediately had someone run up, pick up 3 shirts, press them to perfection and all with a smile and commitment to ensuring I had a great night! She was awesome as was her staff who supported her efforts. I looked great, fwelt great and had a great evening...largely due to their efforts. Thank you Gloria, thank you Westin....

I have used Priceline before but never got such a nice hotel, I was pleased to have booked a Westin, as I have found that usually they are reliable in terms of quality. We stayed in the north tower on the 28th floor and initially we were not impressed when the front desk put us in the room right next to the elevator, but it was quiet enough and the room (and entire hotel) is very nicely styled, great colour scheme, and very contemporary furniture and finishings. The room was pretty small, but we had a great view of the Toronto island and its airport from our room (and I wasn't going to complain, given the price we paid). This hotel is very large and ideal for conferences, events, tourists, etc. It was very busy when we were there as there was a Leafs game that night but the room was relatively quiet despite being close to an elevator. I would recommend staying here if you are visiting Toronto and are traveling with a group or with family. In my opinion it is not a very romantic hotel due to its size and the 'conference'-like feeling of the place, although the views are very nice. We did not eat at the hotel's restaurants or order room service, although I have read reviews of Toula and they are so-so. There are many fine restaurants nearby to choose from, again, great location. The only disappointment we had with the hotel staff was when we requested a late checkout in the evening and the front desk asked us to call in the morning to request a late checkout. Doesn't calling in the morning defeat the purpose of a late checkout if you are checking out late because you want to sleep in??? ;o) Also, valet parking is a bit pricey at $35.00 a day.

My curernt apartment had a mould infestation routing through the ventilation system which caused sickness in me. So the thought of staying at this hotel was a dream come true for me. A place where I could finally sleep and relax. When checking in I asked the extremely polite Service Receptionist if the rooms were hypo-allergenic. She was unsure of this fact. She went to verify the information adn quickly found out that the rooms were not. Ok....not a problem as I'm relatively an easy-going individual. The Receptionist said that she would accomodate Housekeeping to make sure the vents in my room were properly dusted. Great!! That's amazing service!! She also informed me that it would be a 30 min wait. I asked if there was a bar. She of course said yes and pointed to its direction. Again very nice service. When I ventured over to it (afternoon period) there was no one tending the bar. Since I was sick and dehydrated all i wanted wasd to have a drink , sit and relax. I then noticed 2 other women sitting by the large bay wondows enjoying the lovely scenery while enjoying their beverages. In fact many ppl were enjoying their bevs. I go up to the bar attempting to choose my boisson of choice. As I make my decision, one of the chefs walked y me quickly and back into the kitchen. So I thought perhaps I thought ask him where the bartender was. I walked back to the area..called out to one of the chefs. He informed me that he couldn't help me. Alright..that's fine. All I wnated to know was who could help me obtain my goal of becoming dehydrated. Instead he just gave me a dirty look and 'shoe'd' me away. I sadly walked back to a little tony chair to lean back on since I was losing energy. I notice the same chef walk by, again witht the same dirty look, right by me. Then again a couple mins later back to his kitchen to do his job. A couiple miniutes adter that I was greated by 2 menacing security guards asking me who I was waiting for. This to me suggested that they thought I wasn't a client of the hotel. Since I was sick and looked very run down, this also suggested to me that they were pretty much implying that I was a low-class vagabond. This of course upset me and I started to cry. I cried because I was sleep deprived and dehydrated. Not to mentioned incredibly insulted. They tried to give me dirty tap water in attempt to calm me down but I kept refusing. Why? Well regular tap water has bad chemicals in it that casues more dehydration in me. As I stood up to walk away they demanded to see my photo ID. More insults. Insult after insult. As I grwe more upset, they kept trying to push their flirhy tap water down my throat. NICE eh. This while trying to document the secuirty information on my credit card plus photo ID. This is not correct procedure as I told them I no lonfger wanted ot stay in a place like that. They did not comply right away. What is was wrong with this picture? EVERYTHING!! They judged a book by its cover and came out the loser. The loser in which way. Well I happen to come from a wealthy family, plus have my wealth self-made, mind you. All I wanted to do was relax finally then take advantage of as many spa treatments as I could to start feeling like a human being again. What they did was pretty much spat in my face. That is the truth. In this in age. The long days of a recession, businesses have to realise that if their entity is to shine and blossom, clients cannot be treated as numbers or dollar signs. That is what they did to me. Sorry they humiliated me infront of everyone. Me, being a 30 year old, humilated infront of everyone in the hotel, whom probably had more $$ than everyone. If you want my opinion, do not stay at a place like this. There is a far better place around the corner . The newly renovated Intercontinental : AZURA. They, on the other hand, treated me like royalty. If you think I'm bluffing, go ahead...find out for yourself. I did and what an experience that was. I will never forget it EVER. That is why It was important for me to write this review. They wronged me..and they could possibly do it to you..at the expense of your wallet and dignity. Never again will this happen to me. Please do take this review seriously. If the Westin Harbour Castle is reading this, you will know and remember who I was. How could you forget? You made a grown women whom was ill and tired feel like a sick sobbin child in public. With everyone's eyes on me. I hope this is lesson about client service as it pertains to its authenticity.

The people are friendly and responsive to your needs. I consider myself to be a low maintenance traveller, but my \"customer\" is quite the opposite. All this to say, he was very happy with his room as well. I didn't use the internet service as I only got back to my room around midnight, and it cost something like $13 bucks from noon to noon. I don't mind paying extra for services I use, if it means your overall rates are lower...but this doesn't seem to translate. In my case, I can't complain as I used hotwire and got the room at a great rate. My preference is to have all-included so you don't feel like you're getting milked. As for Hotwire, I still can't figure why we have to pay in US dollars, and I don't know who came up with putting the Westin east of downtown, when it is west of Yonge Street. My recommendation to anyone staying in Toronto is choose the area you want...east or west of downtown, choose four stars or better and go with the best rate.

Check-In was quick, although even though they have \"Starwood Preffered Guest Floors\" I was not put on one of those floors even with my membership. I don't know if theres any difference besides a sign stating it is one of those floors. The furniture in the room was a bit scratched up in the first room, 2211. It was also right next to the elevators, with the high speed they act like wind tunnels and can be quite loud, could hear them all night. We also did not have any cold water the first night. Other than that, the room was nice, the beds were comfortable, and the view was decent (East view), but not what the southwest views were like. In the morning, I asked for a new room, the person at front desk did change the room for me and we moved up to 2314, away from the elevators. Room was also cleaner and furniture was not scratched up. After getting a good nights sleep the second and third nights, I walked away with a much more optimistic perspective of this hotel than I did the first night.

Not that its a huge problem, just make sure your aware that you may want to have some cab fare, and there are plenty of them waiting at the hotel. I payed 86/night, so what should I complain about?

I had arranged with the hotel to receive a $50 upgrade to a junior suite. On our arrival, we sat in a line-up of cars for almost 1/2 an hour waiting for this Valet parking. Not a great start as we were on a timeline with reservations and needing to get ready. Once we were finally at the front doors, a man came up and handed us a ticket for the valet parking, which was $40 per night. What they did not tell you was that there is self-parking for $20 on site. We did not get offered this, and did not know about it until we were driving out and saw a teeny little sign on the round-about with the prices on it. $40 is astronomical for parking for one night, and as a preferred guest with Starwood hotels, I was unimpressed that we were not offered a lower rate, or told about the self-parking option. Upon check-in, they upgraded us as per our prior arrangement to the junior suite. Basically this just gets you a larger room, and I think the better view. There was a chaise lounge in the room, however it was extremely uncomfortable, and not really worth it. The view was definitely worth it, but I have heard you can do a $30 upgrade for the view. I would definitely do that instead and save the $20. The larger room size wasn't really worth it. In addition, we called and asked for a wine cork and wine glasses to be brought up as we were celebrating. It took the staff over half an hour to bring these things up to us. By the time it came up, we had to leave to go for dinner. The glasses they brougt up were also filthy. I had to wash them in the sink when we returned from dinner to use them. The wine cork was also this dinky little thing that did not work very well, and broke the cork so that we could not re-cork the bottle properly. We also went to go use the pool, and when we saw it were very disappointed. It does not look like it does in the pictures. The nice blue tile outline does not exist, and the pool itself was tiny. There were 4-5 ppl in it, and we felt uncomfortable joining as the size of it made it seem intimate. The hot tub looked nice, but we didn't bother and just went back upstairs. The outdoor patio looked nice, but it was chilly that day so we didn't go out. All in all, the rooms are decent. You can tell that their multi-million dollar renovation really just added some tiles in the bathroom and new fixtures. The reno's are showing a lot of wear. We have stayed at a few different Westin hotels, and others in the Starwood category, and I must say this one is the most disappointing. I would have expected more especially in Toronto.

This restaurant has an absolutely spectacular view with live music. Please note that the restaurant does not rotate. And don't expect the best service. As other reviewers have said, some of the waiters are testy and it took a while to get some service. However there was one gentleman that was extremely nice and helpful. The food is sub-par. We did have the pasta though, so their more expensive dishes may be more satisfying to those willing to spend more. The parfait dessert wasn't that great either. But overall, a very nice restaurant and I would go again just for the romantic view. There are alot of business people up their celebrating corporate events and there could be some noise after 10:30 as it gets more social. I would suggest going there anytime between 7:30 to 9. Buffet Breakfast at the Missen: The Missen restaurant was pretty nice. My only complaint is that for the money ($20 / person) there should be an omelette station but I did not see any. There is a wide variety of fruits and hot cereals. I stuck to the scrambled eggs, pancakes and egg qasadia. Service was much better here than at Toula. Room: The lakeview room was absolutely spectacular. We were on the 16th floor (room 1624) The pictures do not do them justice! The shape of the room is more of a trapazoid or pentagon with windows on two of the walls overlooking the lake and the dock. The night view with a full moon out is breathtaking and the beds are truly relaxing. One enjoyable feature was the fully flexible dual shower heads with 3-4 different massage features. The rooms are very modern and extremely spacious with a large plasma tv though we never used it. The only dated equipment in the room was the alarm clock / radio. Everything else was top-notch! The elevators are also very fast. Fitness: Amazing fitness centre. They also have jogging sessions in the morning! You will not be dissapointed by the gym facilities. There must be over 20 exercise equipment there and the treadmills face the lake too. The dumbell area is huge as well. Pool: Nothing spectacular except for the large overarching windows letting in natural light. There are many kids and families using the pool (I would say about 10 people in there). There is lots of pool toys, balls, floaters and a kids area with toy trucks and the sort. There is a hot tub as well but it always had 2 to 4 people in there. I must say it was pretty busy when we went but we stil enjoyed outselves. Price: we stayed at this hotel on a saturday (August 2009) after we found amazing deals for the hotel rooms.

We paid just $90 per night (including all taxes) at a time when the hotel\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s published rate was around $238 per night. My partner, parents and myself stayed here in two rooms for two nights in June 2009 as the fourth leg of our 22-day \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcGrand East Coast Tour\u00e2\u20ac\u2122.

On checking-in, I was offered a view room at $30 more (per room, per night) but we were not particularly interested in just looking out at the lake, so declined the offer. I did, however, ask for a high floor. We got two rooms on the 30th floor of the North Tower (looking at the hotel plan, it looks to me like the South Tower is nearer the lake and so probably has more lake view rooms). One of our rooms had a great view of the CN Tower (and we could see the lake if we looked sideways), and the other room was on the other side of the corridor so had a view looking east with more of the lake, but less interesting in our opinion.

The rooms were very nice indeed, with a very comfortable king bed, table, chaise lounge, fridge (key for this given to us at check-in), coffee maker, flat screen TV and a very nice bathroom with hair dryer and lots of towels. The rooms were decorated in creams and browns, and felt classy without being over-the-top. We were very pleased with the location of the hotel. The harbour front was interesting and busier than I expected, and there were more small shops and places for quick eats (cafes, Subway, delis, etc) than expected after reading prior reviews. It was only a pleasant 10-15 minute walk to the shops or the entertainment area, and we really enjoyed the location and the walk to and from the other nearby parts of the city. The hotel had a smallish pool on the fifth floor, located between the two towers. The restaurants at the hotel were too expensive, so we didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t contemplate eating there.

This time we stayed 3 nights. The rooms are large and the beds are Heavenly, soft and plush, making you want to sleep in them forever. The flat screen TV with pivoting wall mount come in handy if you're trying to watch TV from another part of the room. We usually have a partial view of the harbour, but were upgraded at not cost this time to a full harbour view. The harbour is stunning during the day, full of boats going back and forth and on a clear day you can see all the way over to the Toronto Islands, which makes for a great view from the higher floors (we were on the 21st). The bathrooms are large and the shower head is a dual mount, which makes for a relaxing shower. The hotel itself is a short walk to Union Station, Rogers Ctr, the ACC, Guvernment Entertainment Complex and front street where there are tons of eating options. Housekeeping is fantastic and always do a great job tidying up and re-stocking anything you may need at any time during the day. Front desk staff is great as well as our reservations are always in order and this time we had no problems as well. My drwabacks with this hotel are that the valet parking is crazy expensive. $40 a night is a bit steep, but parking elsewhere is a pain as the nearest parking lots are a bit of a walk and getting back up to the hotels main lobby is only available via stairs or steep ramps which doesn't seem very user friendly if you're in a wheel chair or have a stroller. My other draw back is the fact that you have to pay for local phone calls and for Internet Service, in this day and age it seems like those should just be included, but business is business. The food at the Westin is delicious. We had breakfast one morning at the Mizzen Restaurant (lobby of the hotel) which is a breakfast buffet. The buffet has both hot and cold food, a lot of selection including an omlette station. The price of the buffet is costly at about $30 pp for the hot buffet. It's pricey, but well worth it because the food is so delicious. We ordered room service one night (the food also comes from the Mizzen) which cost us apx $80 for a burger, sandwich and a shrimp cocktail. All the food was stunningly displayed but the portions aren't that generous for the price you pay. Keys for the room door de-activate themselves very easily. If you have other peole staying with you, make sure to put their name with the front desk or they will have a hard time re-activating them if you are not around. The slightest magnet around your key will make the key not work (clasps on wallets or purses). Other than the above mentioned drawbacks a weekend at the Westin is great. It's a beautiful, moden hotel and the staff make you feel at home.

Upon arrival at the hotel we found the staff to be very welcoming. The reception area had building work going on but this didn't bother us and there were wooden boards positioned around the area to hide the work going on. Our room was a corner room with a half city and half lake view. It was a nice size with modern furnishings including a large flat screen tv and very comfortable beds. It was very clean and the bathroom especially was to my liking. Although this is primarily a business hotel we found it to be perfect as a base to explore the city. It was within walking distance of all the main attractions (CN tower, shops, restaurants) and was only a short distance away from the metro station. The hotel was right next to the ferry terminal where you caould get a ferry across to the toronto islands.This was especially handy at night when we wanted to go across to the islands and take photos of the skyline. We literally could get off the ferry and we were back at the hotel. We didn't eat in the hotel restaurants but did order room service pizza a few times. This was reasonably priced and one of the biggest pizzas i've seen. The concierge at the hotel was great. they were happy to advise on things to do and see and booked for us to have dinner at the CN tower restaurant one evening. It was also easy to get a taxi from the hotel as there were always several lined up in front. We never noticed a problem with noise in the hotel and considering it's in a city, building works were going on and there were numerous conferences taking place this was a pleasant surprise. We hired a car and drove to Niagara falls for the day, which is well worth doing. Last time i was there i got the hoverferry and bus to Niagara which made it a long day. Having a car meant we could do things at our own pace and we took a trip out to Niagara on the Lake which was beautiful. The drive is very easy, straight roads all the way. Parking was easy when we got to the falls and we had a really great day.

The rooms were clean, roomy for a big city, quiet, and comfortable. That being said, there were a number of problems I had with my stay which made me not terribly happy about the value of my experience. Firstly, the water pressure in general in our room (23rd floor) and the hot water in particular were barely adequate for a comfortable shower. When we called about the problem, someone did come up promptly and tinkered behind the shower, but this didn't affect anything, and, as the guy said, \"I think they just have to turn up the water pressure.\" He said he would let the hotel people know, but nothing changed. Another minus of this hotel is that there are no elevators or escalators from the lobby to the ground level. After climbing the first flight of stairs, there is a phone for assistance, but at this point, this seems rather silly. I realize that Canadian hotels have no obligation to follow the dictates of the Americans with Disabilities Act, but in a supposedly 4-star hotel, this just seems like poor architectural design. A third item which left a bad taste in my mouth was their evening reception. It said \"Enjoy an appetizer and a cocktail from 5-6:30\" (I don't remember the exact time or words, but they were words to that effect). To me, that implied the drink was complimentary, so I wasn't very pleased to find out I was being billed for it (the crepe was free, though--I didn't go back the next two evenings). A fourth problem was that our windows were very dirty. My main reason for wanting to stay here was the views, yet the windows were the dirtiest of any hotel at which we stayed in Canada (9 of them). The final problem I found out when I got home. Despite paying the full rate for one night, we did not get credit towards next year's gold status nor towards their \"Stay 2 nights get one week-end night free\" promotion. I had to send copies of my receipts to Starwood and go through a 2-week process to get the mess straightened out. Why should I have been required to do the foot-work for the hotel's mistake?

There is a pay phone right outside the Gyro shop and I would dial the toll-free number and use that to make calls, I would suggest doing this to anyone on a budget! Be prepared to pay big for parking if you want to park right at the hotel! It's $40 per night, but there are a few cheaper parking lots nearby. They have a business room that is 25 cents per minute to use the internet and 40 cents per page you would like to print, 50 cents for color copies. The pool area was pretty standard. The pool furniture was nice, though. There was never any lack of clean towels at the counter. The hot tub was sweltering hot, though, in my opinion. I don't think I've ever been in a hot tub so hot, I could only stay in for less than 5 minutes before I had to jump in the pool to cool down and I normally LOVE excessive heat! The jets were also fairly sparse. It was just very standard, not what I would expect for a fancy hotel. The workout centre is good, although there are usually a lot of people working out. They have headsets for your use during workout and TV's at many of the machines. I wasn't able to get late checkout as it was booked solid apparently, but I was able to store my items at the front desk for the entire day as I had an 8pm flight and check out was noon. You can get a shuttle for $40 to the airport. I took the subway and a bus. It was $2.75, so it worked out well for me and I only had to walk a few blocks to union station with my luggage. Overall it was a great stay. Good environment and a great deal overall!

The Westin underwent major renovations quite recently, and at the time of writing, the smell of new carpets and paint was evident. The result is that the rooms and public spaces in the hotel are very elegant and attractive. The rooms are typical in terms of size and amenities, but they are very clean and fresh-looking. The in room amenities are very good, with nice touches like a chaise (instead of an armchair), a big flat-screen TV, a single-serving Starbucks coffee maker and the impressive Westin shower head being appreciated touches. Of course, the bed was excellent and made for a very comfortable night's sleep. The views from the 30th floor were very impressive. The soaring view of the lake made me feel like I was at a resort and not in the heart of Canada's largest city. It was quite a pleasant change of scenery (literally). Incidentally, it is located right above the docks for the Toronto Island ferry, which is a must on a nice day. The only major drawback for this hotel (in my eyes, at least - your mileage may vary) is the rather remote location relative to the rest of downtown. I really enjoy walking around in Toronto, and having to walk the same drab stretch of road under a couple of tunnels and bridges to get to Union subway station became annoying (even if it was only about 5-10 minutes). Fortunately the area around the hotel has really matured and there is a good selection of shops and services nearby (including supermarkets, coffee shops, restaurants, etc.) so you don't have to go far for any basic needs. Despite my location-related reservations, I would definitely come back to this hotel.

Overall the stay was pleasant and I would recommend this hotel to anyone staying in the downtown Toronto area. The hotel is geared more to business travelers and had a few conventions/meetings happening while we were visiting. The lobby just underwent a huge renovation and there were still a few workers around repairing and doing odds and ends...nothing distracting though. The overall feeling of the hotel is dark woods, tranquil light and there are fresh flowers in the lobby. The staff were helpful including a quick check-in, helpful concierge and considerate maids. The hotel is on the waterfront which is lovely and relaxing, but there are some restaurants and shops nearby if you want them. It's about a 3-4 minute walk to Union Station & Air Canada Center; and about 15-20 walk to CN Tower and Rogers Centre one way and the same to Distillery District the other way. The upsides: - If you want to go shopping at the Eaton Centre or downtown the hotel provides regular (and free) van trips. - Globe and Mail at your door every morning - Starbucks coffee you can brew in your room, and a Starbucks in the lobby - Westin Heavenly Bed and Heavenly Shower - Awesome views! - They will bring you extra towels, blankets and robes to you room if you need them ... and they're quick. - Airport express bus comes every 1/2 hour (about $35 for 2 people one way) - Bonus: there's a big liquor store nearby The downsides: - There are two flights of stairs or a big incline (through parking garage) to get up to the lobby of the hotel so it's hard to get up with luggage or sore feet from the curb. Cabs will drop you off at the top though. - Parking is expensive (we didn't use) - Wireless is available but it's $20/day! - Rooms have mini fridges you can use but they are full of expensive mini-bar stuff - If the fire alarm goes off (it did once for us) and you're on a high floor (there are 25 in total) it's going to take a long time to get down and the elevators won't work...even for a period of time after the alarm goes off. - The location is lovely but it is a bit far for city-trotting or sightseeing (unless you're up for some walking and/or subway-ing).", "Date": "May 19, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "glasgow, uk", "Title": "\u201cperfect.\u201d", "Author": "lordbarneth", "ReviewID": "UR29966083", "Content": "we got a great deal thorugh priceline, worked out about \u00c2\u00a360 per night. we joined the starwood preferred guest prgramme and this seemed to get us a wonderful room on the 33rd floor of the south tower with great views of both the lake and the city. room, the service, location was ideal. if on a budget there is ane xcellent deli and general store just across the street and an lcbo just along the road. 10 min walk takes you to the union station subway station.", "Date": "May 14, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "1.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Denver", "Title": "\u201cOne of the Worst hotel stays I have ever had\u201d", "Author": "Herzmoor", "ReviewID": "UR29950274", "Content": "I am so glad that I am changing hotels for the remainder of my stay in Toronto.

This is a conference hotel, so expect the bar and lounge to be pretty full with suits during cocktail hour. Check-in was simple, the hotel was sparkling and clean, although there was minor construction going on. The room was spacious with huge windows and the king-sized bed was plenty of space for two. The bathroom was also well lit and spacious, as well as clean. The indoor pool and workout area should be more than enough to fit your needs while on vacation. The area the hotel is located in can be either good or bad. If you head east you'll pass some factories and go through a grimy area, although still safe. Head west though and you can walk along the shore and enjoy the Queens Quay.

When we arrived at our room I immediately noticed our bed linen was dirty. I called down to have them changed and housekeeping was sent in immediately. She was courteous and did a great job. Next, I called down for two bathrobes (something I never had to do at the Westin Tremblant or any of our other favorite hotels as the robes are usually already in the room when we arrive). The man who brought them up looked like we were inconveniencing him. Worse, one of the robes were also dirty and had to be sent back. On a side note, and this really speaks to the \"cleanliness\" of this hotel, we went to get some ice in the ice room later that day and found the same dirty bathrobe laying on the ground outside the laundry area. The ice machine was kept in a room across from what looked like a laundry area. Still, it's nothing a guest should see when going for ice. I know it was the same robe because I saw the same disgusting brown stain on the hem. The dinner we had from room service was great. Breakfast was a whole other story. A $20 breakfast was ordered. It was supposed to come with eggs, toast, bacon, sausage and ham. The breakfast arrived without the sausage or bacon. I called to confirm that it was indeed supposed to come with those items and I was told yes and they apologised and sent the bacon and sausage separately- 40 minutes later! My husband's breakfast was cold by then. Finally, I wanted to go out on the sun deck for fresh air but was told they lock that door in the winter and not given a reason why. If a guest wants to go outside on the sun deck they should be allowed- even winter. Furthermore, the lady at the service desk was very rude about it.

We were a bit taken aback and ended up with valet parking almost before we knew what had happened. I'm not a pushover by any means but found their aggression surprising. Also, there is a charge of $11.50 anytime you would like to get your car out of valet parking before your departure. The staff member at the front desk at check-in was unfriendly and unhelpful. He was mumbling, condescending, not forthcoming with information, and generally unfriendly. The room was small but very clean. The bed was extremely comfortable. Bathroom was clean. The shower had very little pressure and they didn't leave us enough bath towels (1 towel for two of us), although they did deliver more quite promptly when we called. There was a minibar which we did not use, as well as a 1-cup coffeemaker with enough coffee for only one person. We had looked at the hotel website ahead of time and were looking forward to using the pool and hot tub, which looked lovely in the photos. However, it turned out that it was closed for renovation during our stay, a fact which was conveniently omitted from the website. The hotel is about a 10-15 minute walk from Union Station, although there is a streetcar station closer. It's not terribly inconvenient (and would be great if you were only going to the Air Canada Centre which is virtually across the street), but the location is a bit of a pain compared to other upscale hotels in town. Overall, for $75 per night, I can't complain - it was comparable to a run-of-the-mill Best Western in a small town. But for a four-star, downtown, \"upscale\" hotel whose usual rate is $250 per night? Disappointing.

The room looked out onto a roof deck with absolutely no view of anything but the windows of surrounding buildings. The room had a huge hole in the ceiling that had been patched by someone who seemed to be trying out for the show, \"Canada's Worst Handyman\". We immediately asked to be switched to another room and that was done without any problem. The next room had a great view of Lake Ontario and the ferry service, but there was a large crack in the bathroom sink that was repaired with a lot of caulk and most likely by the same amateur handyman some time ago. (See both photos with this review.) The bar and lounge area of the hotel, just off the lobby, had all the warm ambiance of center ice at a hockey game. The food was lack lustre.

We booked our room a while back with Travelzoo ($169 per night for a lake front room with two beds and including breakfast for two adults). Check in is said to be at 3PM. We arrived after 4PM and were told our room was not ready and that we should check back in 30 minutes. They offered us a room with one king bed but we explained to the front desk that this was not acceptable since we had two children and that we reserved a room with two beds. When we returned 30 minutes later, another person at the front desk served us and we were then told that we would have to wait at least another hour (almost 6PM) for our room to be ready. We were told the hotel was very busy and that they were having trouble getting all of the rooms ready for the weekend. When they said there was nothing they could do, I asked to speak to the manager who magically found another room that was ready and had two beds and a lake front room. He apologized for the delay and extended the free breakfast for both children as well. The hotel provides children who stay there a small kit which includes a hat, crayons, and activity book (we had to remind the front desk to provide it to us since they forgot to do so). The room was a decent size. The bedding, like all Westin hotels, was very comfortable. The lake view was pretty and we were able to see boats arrive and depart during the day. The large 32 inch LCD TV was mounted on the wall. The bathroom was a good size and the shower had a curved shower rod to give you more room. There was a fee for internet service which although disappointing seems to be the norm for higher end hotels We had the breakfast buffet each morning since it was included in the price of the room. It had a nice choice of cold cereal, danish, mini muffins, fresh fruit (surprisingly no fresh berries of any kind), eggs, pancakes, bacon and a station where omelettes were prepared to order. My family used the pool several times. It is a nice size and the hotel provides plenty of towels. Unfortunately, the hot tub was not working properly the first two days we were there (warm water but no bubbles) and it was closed for repairs the last day we were there. The wooden chairs around the pool all have seat cushions to make lounging comfortable. One side of the pool overlooks the lake while the other side opens to the outside where there is an outdoor area to enjoy the sun and the view of downtown as well as an outdoor tennis court. Parking was a choice of valet in the hotel ($35 per day with in/out privileges) or park yourself in an outside lot ($17 per day with in/out privileges) 5 minutes away from the hotel. When I told the hotel Ichose the latter option, I was told that it was not guarded overnight and that they were not responsible for any damage that might occur. In the end, I was happy I chose this option. I liked the location of the hotel. it is located on the harbourfront and a close walk to the Air Canada Center (5 minutes), CN Tower and Rogers Center (15 minutes).

We had to park outside of the hotel, near the Captain's Restaurant. It costs about $20 each day. Make sure to lock and secure your car if you do park outside.

It's very fancy when you go inside and very, very large lobby. We had to wait in line to check in, people working at the front desk were really nice. The room was FANTASTIC!

It looks terrific. Beds are VERY comfortable with great bedding as advertised. You can walk to downtown REALLY EASILY from this hotel- very convenient if you need to walk to the eaton centre or the greyhound bus terminal. We took a cab to see We WIll Rock You (too far to walk). It is literally as close as can be to get the ferry to go to the toronto islands, and easy to get to any other toronto attraction you may have had in mind. The only drawbacks as I see it are 1.) Walking under the gardner expressway at night? No thanks. You have to walk under here to get to downtown from the hotel and it's a dark tunnel that feels safe during the day but you wouldn't want to walk there at night. I was sad to have to step over sleeping homeless people during the daytime here. 2.) The bathroom sink and mirror are gorgeous but turn around and look at your bathtub and you may be disappointed. It's very basic, a ruststain was smeared on the wall under the handrail, and in our bathroom, the bathroom wasn't perfectly clean. In hotel rooms we all like the \"perfectly shining\" look since you are coming in after strangers after all, and there were two eyelashes on the toilet seat when I first walked in, and from looking at the floor I saw that it had dusty corners on the floor and just needs to be much more thoroughly cleaned. Thought that information may be helpful to you but I honestly loved this hotel and would go back in a heartbeat. Great dinner at it's restaurant Mizzen as well.

Four Seasons is highly expensive and over rated IMO. One disadvantage is it's location is far from the action, but you are honestly within a ten minute walk from the subway and you are beside the largest liquor store in Toronto, also a ten minute walk.

We did talk to a housekeeping lady and she told us to call a number. The \"heavenly\" beds felt like a normal bed. It was worth being the 15 minute walk to downtown for the view.

The location of the hotel for us was fine, we walked everywhere with the ACC in walking distance for us (we had tickets for a Maple Leafs Game), the CN tower and to walk up Yongue Street was ideal!! All staff were pleasant and were pleased to help you if needed, no pressure from bell-boys to use them and no hassle. We also walked to the exhibition centre and to be honest wasn't that far, however would recommend wooly hats and gloves if its cold as the wind off the lake is chilling but a great walk!!

First impressions were of a serially renovated lobby, with two room towers rising above. Not sure when this was constructed, but the lobby design, even with very nice renovations, shows it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s age. Check-in, via an SPG Elite lane was fast, and I was upgraded (I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m SPG Gold) to a very, very nice room. I was in the tower nearest the check-in desk. The way this tower is structured, there seem to be two wedge-shaped rooms on each floor which have terrific space\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 On the 10th floor, they were 1024 and 1019. These are quasi-corner rooms, with a LOT of extra space. The room held both a settee and a chair, as well as desk, King bed, and low dresser with large flatscreen TV. There was an adjoining room door in my room, and I could hear everything the folks next door were saying. That was annoying. Internet access was fast and solid. There was free Starbucks in the room, along with free bottled water. The room had the requisite Heavenly Bed and Heavenly Bath, and was sparkling clean. I had windows across two full walls (of the five walls in the room) which was really nice\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 Spectacular view of the lake, just gorgeous. I grabbed a cup of Starbucks in the lobby en route to my conference, and was stunned at the prices for orange juice and coffee. In the evening, I met with some colleagues for drinks, and found the bar wine prices to be far more reasonable (ounce for ounce) than the coffee. Nice wine list in the bar, with a good many VQAs available. I had one meal at The Mizzen, their generic restaurant, and was delighted with a seafood on pasta dish. I explained to the waiter that I needed to eat and head out quickly, and he delivered my meal as fast as I could have hoped. Not spectacular from a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153look and feel\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd standpoint, but great service and excellent food. Check-out was fast and the bill was accurate. Location was fine for me, as they had shuttles running to/from the conference I was attending. It is not centrally located for the business district, and would need a couple of blocks hike\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 and not connected to PATH, so in January, that might be a bit unpleasant. I had a group rate here, so that worked well for me and my business here. Do I go back? Probably not. The excellent room, and the good staff is not enough to offset the distance from Front Street and the CBD\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 especially in the winter. If you have business downtown, you might still be better off at the Royal York, the Intercon, the Renaissance SkyDome, or (with a PATH hike) the Marriott Eaton.

The Westin Harbour Castle is a modern, aesthetically pleasing hotel situated right on the waterfront in Toronto. You'll probably get a pleasant view, whether you're facing the lake or the city's bustling skyline. All of the expected conveniences of a major luxury hotel are available on-site. But you'll probably read all of that glowing praise in the other reviews here. Now, for the less sparkling review. Unless you're booking on Priceline, you can expect to pay $200+ for any room in this hotel. This is not surprising for a Westin, but the charges don't end there. Other reviews noted the $30/day valet parking. Let me describe some other charges: internet access ($10.65 per day and per computer), business centre computer access ($0.25/min), local and toll-free calls ($2 each with additional charges after 60 min), and buffet breakfast ($26), to name a few. Even the refrigerator was locked...presumably you have to pay to use that, too. Basically, with our $250+ room rate, we got an average size room, 2 double beds, a \"partial\" lake/city view, a flat-screen LCD TV (which actually shows no HD channels), and a modern decor bathroom with a loose toilet seat. Everything else was an additional charge. Those of you who have ever worked in the hospitality industry know that the profit margins for hotels like this is already extremely high. Is it necessary to then nickel-and-dime the customer for every modern convenience that would otherwise be available for free at some other business class hotels? By the way, I'd also like to agree with another reviewer that many of the staff were rather snobby. Generally, the people of Toronto are very warm and friendly, probably moreso than any US city I've visited, so I'll have to say that many of the staff at the Westin were the coldest people I met in Toronto (with the exception of the housekeeper, who got a nice tip from us for being so kind). Also, they had a strange \"security\" and \"no entertaining\" policy for New Years Eve, where people who were not registered in the room were not allowed up to the guest rooms after a certain time - not even when accompanied by a registered guest. There was no warning of this policy until when we checked in. I think it was instituted not as a security measure, but more for the benefit of some of the stodgy old people who stay in hotels like this and expect to leave their new years parties promptly at 12:30 and be in bed by 1:00. I must admit that I haven't stayed in enough luxury hotels to know if the above issues are typical, but if they are, I'll stick with midrange and business class hotels.", "Date": "January 16, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Kanata, ON", "Title": "\u201cA romantic retreat in the city.\u201d", "Author": "reclermo", "ReviewID": "UR12477038", "Content": "I have yet to stay in a Westin hotel and have any problems.

Internet is available, but it's about $12 per night. I used it and it worked well. There is a safe, an ironing board, etc. the usual fare. All the rooms have large flat screen TV's that are very nice, but in my case, because the room was so long and narrow, it was situated quiet far from the bed. The lobby is very nice, with a bar and a restaurant and a helpful concierge. Walking up to the hotel from the street can be rather tough because you end up walking up the driveway where cars are pulling out. Across the street is a sportsbar that serves reasonable food. All indoors are non-smoking in Ontario at this point, so the dining was pleasant. There is also an outdoor mall across the street where you can by food and refreshments for your room. Room service was okay - but of course, expensive. As a snack I ordered the cheese and fruit plate and it was very good. The staff was generally friendly and checkin/checkout was easy. The meeting accommodations seemed a bit dated and worn. The all glass walls looking out onto the lake were very dirty, the ceiling tiles were stained, and a lot of the paint near the A/C vents and other areas of the ceiling was chipped or completely gone. If you looked around, things looked in rather rough shape in the meeting rooms (which are mainly across the street, connected by a walkway). There is a bus that runs from the airport to the hotel. It's about $25 per person round trip and takes about 30 minutes each way. It runs about every 30 mins. Good news is that it's the first stop after you leave the airport, and the airport is the first stop when you leave the hotel. The bus ride was comfortable and safe. I would recommend this as a family place to stay, if you wanted to be downtown and convenient to the downtown Toronto attractions. For business meetings, it was okay but again, what I noticed, and the comments I heard were that it's a bit long in the tooth.", "Date": "September 30, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "2", "Check in / front desk": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "toronto", "Title": "\u201cHorrible\u201d", "Author": "TorontoTripmaster", "ReviewID": "UR10001496", "Content": "My experience in this hotel was terrible.

On the day of arrival, when I went to the front desk for check-in around 11pm, the receptionist told me that there is no room with two beds left.

We walked to the CN Tower in 15-20 minutes. We took the tram to the CNE and Ontario Place - the kids enjoyed the tram ride. The stop was right near the hotel. Since we got it via Hotwire, didn't expect a view. However, we did get a partial view of the harbor. We also drove to other areas in downtown, Chinatown and Markham to meet friends. The drive was fairly easy. We used valet parking which was $20/day. As in all Westin Hotel, the room is clean, comfortable and offers a sense of luxury. The swimming pool is of very good size and they always seem to have the best swimming pools. The gym had such great views and equipment that almost motivated me to exercise but just for the lack of time, we didn't. The stay was unbelievable cheap ... the only thing that shocked us at first was the taxes and taxes ... and fees. The valet parking per night ended up to be much more than $20 due to taxes and more taxes. I will say the parking is a must if you have a car. There seems to be some problems with the valet when we were there. Sometimes the car was delivered pretty quickly and sometimes you left a message and when you got down there, they forgot you were supposed to pick up the car. Of course, their attitude was always very apologetic in those situations. It is not a hotel that gives you a warm and fuzzy customer service feeling. It is after all a business hotel.

I booked this hotel through Priceline.com bidding and only paid $70 US a night for it. As a result I didn't expect to receive the best room with the best view, but I was wrong. We drove to Toronto from Michigan and when we arrived we were tired and ready for a shower. The valets took care of our car and we were checked in and up to our room less than 5 minutes after arriving. Our room was number 2815 in the south tower. It had a partial view of the harbor and going east down Queen Quay. The best of both worlds! Westin recently switched to a total non smoking hotel, but the room we were in was obviously a former smoking room. It smelled faintly of it which did not bother us. However, if you are sensitive to smoke you should request a former non-smoking room. The decor of the room was modern (which is my taste) and everything is well appointed. The linens both bed and bath were better than average and the TV was lovely. The dark wood contrasting with the white linens was very appealing. While I have stayed in larger hotel rooms there was still plenty of room for the 2 of us. We did take advantage of the pool and hot tub. Both are larger and nicer than average. While there my husband did have a 50 minute deep tissue massage and said it was the best one he has ever had. The lobby bar was a nice stop on the way up to our room. The piano player on Friday is an excellent jazzman and his rendition of \"Take 5\" is beautiful. The location of the hotel is perfect for us. The harbor district is developing and there are a lot of things to do, see and eat while walking the few blocks. We took the boat tour around the harbor and islands and it was great to see the skyline from that vantage point. When I am visiting a city I walk a lot. The CN tower, Rogers Centre, the Entertainment District, Hockey Hall of Fame, The Esplanade, and Union Station are all a 5-15 minutes walk of the hotel.

However the Westin Harbour Castle was excellent and made up for the previous New York accommodation. We had a beautiful room, on the 21st floor, it was huge and spotless and overlooked Lake Ontario. The bed was heavenly - so comfortable. We have previously stayed in a Westin hotel in Vancouver which seemed huge and soulless, but this was a lot better with a nice, popular bar area with charming staff. The breakfast was good and we enjoyed a dinner in the restaurant with a lovely friendly waiter in attendance. My only crtitism with the hotel is the trouble we had with the safe being permanently locked, and the front desk staff. On arrival I reported the safe and also asked for soap for the bathroom, the soap arrived straight away, but the safe was never fixed. Also I asked two different people on reception if they had an airline check in facility and they both directed me to the business centre on the lower ground floor, where there was no sign of it. I didn't feel the reception staff were particulary warm and helpful. However, on our last day we very much appreciated the late check out we were given and our thanks to the young lady on the concierge desk who very kindly offered to mail my postcards for me at no expense - I had been waiting to be seen for some time, and our coach was waiting.

Please don't stop reading because of my age. SO. My parents and my best friend went to Toronto over Fourth of July weekend for a fun getaway. At first we stayed a TERRIBLE hotel that wasn't in a good part of Toronto. Bums would approach me and and my friend (who is also fourteen) and asked us to light their ciggarette. Considering this was a recommended hotel, we quickly fled to the Westin. Let me tell you, this hotel was gorgeous. My friend and I shared a room that connected to my parents' room. Our beds were SO luxurius and we could see the lake and parts of the city. It was such a contrast from the previous hotel. The beds were extremely comfortable and and everything was clean! Well, let me tell you of the good things. The pool is absolutely stunning. Also, they have tennis courts and basketball hoops. They also had an amazing gym where most excerise equipment had a TV to watch while you were working out. (The hotel provided headphones.) The hotel rooms came with Starbucks coffee which was very nice. Now for the bad things. Our toilet broke, but it was quickly fixed by hotel staff. But, then out door broke! We could not get in with our key! So, the maintenence said they could fix it the next day. We declined because we would be leaving soon. We jsut entered through my parents room. The concierge recommended a very expensive retaurant even when we told him that was not what we were looking for. Everything was going swimmingly until out last full day there. We left late to go get some dinner and when we finally got back to the hotel, it was around nine. To our shock there were police cars, ambulances, and news vans all around our hotel. My Dad asked a newsman what happened and he simply said, \"A guy got shot in the elevator.\" We passed tons of cops and got into the hotel. People flooded the lobby. We went to the concierge and asked if we could go to our room. He said it was fine because the shooting occured in the other tower. We went up to our room and after my Dad checked the room, we went in. Since we were leaving the next morning (and because we didn't know if we had to leave that night) we started packing. We turned on the news to hear something about the shooting. Something about it came on and we listened carefully. The report said that the shooter might still be in the hotel. (It turned out he really wasn't.) Around ten o'clock, there was an announcement on the loud speaker saying that the hotel was under lockdown. We went to bed a little freaked out, but with all the cops, we felt safe. The next morning, everything seemed normal. We checked out as planned and we heard about what happened. It turned out to be a drug deal gone bad. They found ten of so pounds of cocaine in an ice room. The man that was shot was not killed and his shooter was found. The both are now facing criminal charges. This hotel was very nice and you should not be worried about safety. In my opinion it was handled very well and it did not wreck my stay. Crime can happen anywhere.

I booked the room via Priceline for $70! After encountering a snow storm on our drive up, we arrived after midnight very fatigued.

We were in the North tower in room 2818. The pictures don't do the rooms justice, they were gorgeous. My hubby just loved the flat screen tv and I loved the view from the chaise situated next to the window. The next day we went to go eat and had to walk all the way outside to give the valet our ticket. When they brought the car out, they pulled it as far away from us as possible and turned it off. I had to walk over muddy puddles to get to the car and we were the only ones out there. They could have left the car closer so that we could hop right in and they could have left it running. When we came back the room hadn't been cleaned because my husband left the DND sign on the door by mistake. When I went to get ice I saw a cleaning lady and asked her if we could have the bathrobes that were supposed to be in the room anyway. She brought them. We went down to the gift shop and when we came back another cleaning lady was in the room cleaning. We left her a tip and went down to the bar. The bartenders were literally competing on who would serve us. I suppose they were competing on who would get the tip. This display of behavior was unwarranted and especially not so the customer can see. It was an uncomfortable feeling. On the day of our departure, they were pretty busy so we expected to wait a while for the car. When I saw that they had brought the car out we headed out with our luggage and there was no valet able to tell us where the keys were. They had just driven the car up there but no one knew who had the keys. So, we are standing there waiting for someone to bring over the keys.

Room was fantastic with a Heavenly Bed, chic furnishings, chaise at the window, plasma wide-screen TV and view of the harbour. Even though the weather was miserable most of the weekend (the tail end of a hurricane), the room was warm and cozy. We did not use the mini-bar - prices were high but would have liked to have the use of the fridge. There is an in-room safe in the ample closet. The bathroom was lovely, and again, upscale. The Heavenly Shower really was heavenly although the towels could have been more ample. The shampoo, lotion and soap were great. All amenities can be purchased through the Westin website. Did have a small problem with our room lock being recoded on the second day of our stay and we were unabe to get into our room. Security came up and fixed the problem promptly. Considering the size of Cesar, the security guard, I certainly felt safe in the hotel! The store in the lobby has souvenirs, snacks, pop, water, newspapers and lottery. Staff are very friendly. Each evening, we enjoyed the bar in the lobby. Live piano entertainment, cold beer and munchies. Great service from Danny! Ate Sunday brunch at the Mizzen - buffet $24.95 for adults and worth it. Individually made omelettes by Alex, lots of hot food, fruit, breads, cereal, cheese, unlimited juice and other drinks. The pool area is large, bright and well-equiped. The attendant will even rope off a lane of the pool if you want to do laps. The hot tub was not very hot, though. Did not use the exercise room overlooking the pool. This area is accessable from both towers. My husband and I had a couples hot-stone massage in the spa. Expensive but again worth every penny! Very friendly staff - a relaxing way to spend a Sunday morning. Will definitely do that again! Hotel is location within walking distance from the ACC, Entertainment District, CN tower, Hockey Hall of Fame and Yonge Street Shopping. If you don't want to walk too far, there is an underground streetcar entrance across from the hotel that will take you to Union Station. From Union Station, take the Exhibition Streetcar one stop - you stay underground the whole time - very convenient and they run late. Will definitely stay here again - truly enjoyed our visit.", "Date": "November 18, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Ely, Cambs., UK", "Title": "\u201cGreat Location - Great Views\u201d", "Author": "FennyMan", "ReviewID": "UR6131020", "Content": "Spent 2 nights here and really enjoyed it - a lovely hotel in a stunning harbour front location.

We booked through Canadian Affair for gbp78 per night. I had noticed that other people had mentioned lesser amounts on their reviews but when we arrived at the hotel we thought every penny was worth it. Check-in was quick and easy, we'd arrived at 8.30 in the evening. I asked at check-in for a room with a view of the lake and I was told one had already been allocated for me - it was a newly refubished room. When we got to room 740 we could smell the new paste and wallpaper smell - which I dont mind as my dad is a painter and decorator. Good size room with two double beds, plasma tv and very tasteful bathroom. The colours used for decorating were slightly dull - taupe and dark brown but with such a fantastic view we didnt look at the walls too much. Of an evening we could see all the little ferry boats lit up which was very romantic. The Concierge desk was very useful and advised us that about 100 yards out of the hotel and turn left was Cocoberry's cafe and we had breakfast there every day - Eggs Benedict with a lovely fresh fruit kebab for CAD6.95. Top Tip - check on the internet what time sunset is and book a table at the CN tower 360 revolving restaurant about 15-30 mins beforehand. What a great view - very romantic watching the sunset. We had the fixed price menu for CAD64 each.Nice choice of menu and this price includes the express external lift and also a stop off at the glass floor level - my husband stood on it but I wouldnt go anywhere near ! However, the wine is expensive in the restaurant , we wanted a red Merlot and at CAD64 it was the third cheapest bottle on the menu. We found the people of Toronto to be really pleasant - some of the friendliest people we have ever met abroad and we felt safe wherever we walked. No litter about to speak of and if we accidently bumped into people -as we were gazing skywards taking in the views - it was they who apologised to us ! . About those steps outside the hotel , we've counted them for those of you who may be curious- there are 30 in total which we found no problem - we also walked up the ramp several times without any bother from cars - stick to the sides and you;ll be ok -there is actually a strip marked with paint on the left side for pedestrians. About those beds - yes they are comfortable but the sheets are far too small. Once in bed they only just cover you at the sides and if you fidget about at all you end up uncovered. There are two padded quilts on the bed. One is sandwiched between two sheets and then there is a top decorative quilt, which, because it is covered in a satin type fabric, ends up sliding onto the floor during the night. We found it odd that we couldnt find much information in our room about hotel facilities.i.e. if we had wanted breakfast they didnt promote it very well - we couldnt find anything to say how much it was or where to go and get one in the hotel. The swimming pool was lovely with a large glass wall overlooking the lake and really nice sun loungers to relax on. They offer a free shoeshine service from your room. We did order room service one evening and it was lovely food, well presented but expensive at CAD18 for a burger and fries. Dont miss Niagara falls and definately dont stay in a hotel there - It really is like Blackpool , all amusement arcades -cheap and tacky. However, you must try to get to Niagara- on- the- Lake a beautiful small town just about 15 mins from Niagara. Really ,quaint shops with window boxes full of flowers everywhere.

The water pressure was great, and the marble and lighting in the bathroom was a beautiful touch. Some have had issues with the location of the hotel. I didn't find it to be a problem at all. Three blocks to Union Station was nothing compared to the rest of the walking we did all week! I thought three blocks from everything was extremely convenient in a city like Toronto.

We checked in later in the evening (9pm on Friday) without a problem, the Front Desk staff were excellent, the room was a semi lakeview, looking east on the 35th floor. Upon entering the room we both immediatly noted how the room was warmer than the hallway even though the room Air Conditioning was set to cold and the blow set to high, we decided to give the AC a chance to see if there would be any change. A short time later I was about to sit down to do some work on my laptop only to find very prominent stains all over the chair, as well as other dried solid substances (don't even want to venture a guess at what it could have been). Other negative points of this room that didn't bother much, but should be mentioned include a non-functional light switch, dirty light switches and somewhat dated/well used furniture. After seeing the chair and still not feeling any change in the room temperature I called the Front Desk and informed them of the problems. Without even asking me I was informed that they would upgrade me to a full lakeview room on the 18th floor, they even asked if we would like a Bellman to be sent up to help with our bags (we declined the Bellman as we were both able to manage ourselves). Our new room was much better in all respects; clean chair, ice cold AC, a small bit larger and an excellent view of the water. Overall I found the staff to be friendly and more than happy to assist you. Also on a positive note you do get free Starbucks coffee for your inroom coffee maker, a delicious way to start your morning. In comparison to other high ranked hotels I have stayed at I found the Harbour Castle to be lacking in the simple areas, this includes bathroom amenities (you're only given the basic shampoo, conditioner and hand cream) and replacement of burned out lightbulbs in the guest rooms.

Upon check-in we requested a bottle of champagne be sent up to our room and they upgraded us to a harbor view room because it was our honeymoon. The view was great, you could see a little airport where planes and helicopters land and all of the boats coming and going all day. The best part was that at night when it wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t cloudy the moon cast such a bright light across the water that you could sit on the couch with all of the lights off and still be able to see. We ate at Toula, the restaurant at the top of the South tower for dinner the first night. The view was the same from our room and the food was OK, but just ordinary. We learned that they seat in this circular, glass-walled restaurant depending upon the season and time of day. In the summer, if you make your reservation before nine, you will be seated with a view of the harbor; after nine with a view of the city. We had a bottle of wine sent up to the room and it arrived quickly. The second day we ordered room service for breakfast. We each had eggs over medium and they were cold when they arrived. The rest of the meal was fine, but for the price, I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d recommend walking down to Queen\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Quay for breakfast. We visited the spa that afternoon and each received an hour massage and pedicure. The prices were comparable to what you pay outside of a hotel and the service was just as good. My husband was able to overcome his shyness and had a great time. That night the concierge recommended Harbour 60 for dinner. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a steakhouse within waking distance of the hotel and was absolutely wonderful! Be prepared to spend quite a bit, we spend around $450, but the meal was worth it. Their wine list is the size of a Bible and carries bottles from between $60 and $3000. (we stuck with an $84 McManis Family Cabernet Sauvignon) The steaks are wonderful (best I have had in a long, long time) and very large! We ordered salads to start a few sides (everything is a la carte) and I couldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t finish my steak. Lauren was our waiter and he was great! Very friendly! The next night we decided to venture further from the hotel so we went to the Ontario Science Center, which my husband remembers fondly from his childhood. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not within walking distance and is a $25 cab ride from the hotel. In our opinion, the museum was not what it was in its heyday and the $14 admission per person was nowhere near worth it. There were only a few exhibits and most attractions were broken. The building itself was very dirty. I would not suggest anyone, even those with children, go to the Museum. Dinner and a movie this night, Paramount on Adelaide for MII: 3 and drinks and snacks at Milestones next door. They invented the Bellini and the service is wonderful. Each night we returned to find our room very clean and orderly. The beds are wonderful, my husband said almost evil, because you will be tempted to stay in them all day.

On arrival, there were plenty of staff who were willing to help with the luggage. If you're walking into the hotel, I would recommend taking the stairs just beside of the main hotel entrance. There is another door there and a separate set of stairs. The car entrance is not really designed for travellers on foot. Entering the hotel, by foot, with luggage is definitely a pain. We stayed in a corner room. This included a partial view of the lake, a view of the CN Tower, and a partial view of the skyscrapers. I have included a few photos of the view. Unfortunately, the view of the CN Tower did not turn out. We sat and watched the boats sail up and down the harbour. The room was very clean. The bathtub was really comfortable. They provide a rolled towel, so that you can relax and rest your head while soaking. The shower was the usual Westin Heavenly Shower with message or spray features. The bed was a soft heavenly bed with plenty of pillows. She loved the bed. We ordered room service all weekend, and the food was delicious. The quality was above every day restaurant food. I found that it was delivered quickly, and that it was still very hot. The menu selection included choices like: Real Cod Fish and Chips with Malt Vinegar (excellent!), Sirloin Hamburger (mmm!) With Chips Or Caesar Salad Chicken BLTs and wraps (needed for some dressing) NY Striploin Steak (really tender and juicy) with Mashed Potatoes with veggies. One evening, we relaxed and had drinks in the lobby, while listening to the piano. We also ate Sunday breakfast at the buffet in the Mizzen. I LOVED the fresh scones with butter and excellent strawberry jam. Breakfast was $23 each plus tax. There was a minibar that was included in the room and a coffee maker in a separate area. I found two or three Starbucks coffee pouches. Someone said in a previous review that the coffee was not free. However, we did find a card that said that the coffee was complimentary and that there was more in the minibar area for purchase. The location of the hotel, down by the water, was very nice. We took evening strolls along the boardwalk, and fed the ducks. In the general area, there are some harbourfront shops, and a Second Cup coffee shop a few blocks away. If you need a convenience store there is one about three blocks down towards the CN Tower. It includes a deli section as well. If you would like to spend a quiet day relaxing, take the harbour ferry across the lake. It's right by the hotel. Rent a bicycle and ride through the peaceful country landscape. Have a picnic here, and checkout the amazing views of the entire downtown area from here. We did that last year, and loved it! There is a subway station about four blocks from the hotel. From there, it's an easy ride to most places in the city. If you're having trouble walking, I would recommend a short cab ride to your destination, or the subway station. For most people, it shouldn't be too much, though. Parking shouldn't a problem either. There's at least four separate parking lots within walking distance. Seventeen dollars a day is probably the maximum you'll pay. Parking is actually a bit cheaper here than closer to city hall. The only bad moment of the trip was when a Toula restaurant employee was snarky with us. But that's not the Westin's fault. Because of that we ended up having a romantic dinner in our room, with a wonderful view of the lake, and a background of skyscrapers. The prices on the room service menu were less expensive than Toula, and the privacy was wonderful. Toula lost a customer, but I gained a new appreciation for hotel room dining. Before we went to this hotel, I was interested to see how it would compare to the Sheraton. They are both excellent. If you want to walk to the Eaton Centre all the time, choose the Sheraton.

This hotel was nice, but it was not spectacular. I booked through Hotwire and stayed in a non smoking, king sized bed, harbor view room in the South Tower. I paid $30 CAN a night to \"upgrade\" to a Harborfront room, and with taxes it ended up costing $35 CAN a night. In the end, I thought it was a total waste of money. The front desk staff were friendly and actually let me check in 4 hours early (check in time is at 3pm) free of charge. Check in kind of took longer than normal, but I can't complain since he let me check in so early. We opted to do self-park since I couldn't stand paying so much for valet (we never use our car when we're in TO anyway). I actually would not recommend you do self-park. The valet lady told us that it's not safe to park your car there; I thought she was just trying to get me to spend money on the valet but really, it's not very safe. You just park in a random, uncovered lot. Your car is just out there in the open. I put \"The Club\" on my car and felt the need to check it every few hours. I usually feel very safe in TO; if I had to park like this in any other city, I would definitely not do it. But, you pay the lady at the hotel for the total nights you are doing self-park (at $17 CAN per night) and she gives you a bright blue piece of paper you have to put on your dashboard while you are parked. Otherwise, they say they're going to tow your car. The elevators in this particular hotel are extremely fast, so that was great. There are a lot of elevators as well, so you never really have to wait. Our room was really small but it was clean and comfortable. Nothing at all spectacular. If I had paid the price they post on the door, I would be pretty upset. And yes, for some of the people who are paying more than us Hotwire and Priceline people, if I saw that I had to pay $5 for a bottle of water and $13 for a shaving kit containing things you wouldn't even find at a dollar store, I would be irked as well. When we settled into our room, we quickly found that our coffee maker was broken and the tv remote was out of batteries. We called down to the front desk and they sent replacements up in a matter of minutes and then checked again to make sure everything was okay. I thought the service was very nice. I didn't think the hotel was as far away from the subway as some other reviewers made it out to be. 5 minutes at the most. Yes, you do have to walk under the Gardiner Expressway but it's paved, lit, covered, and safe. At night, there are people begging but they are in no way aggressive. If you don't want to give them anything, just acknowledge with a nod and they are on there way. If you don't want to walk under the Gardiner, and want to take public transit, go to the TTC streetcar stop that is in front of the hotel and take the 509 or 510 to Union Station. It's quick, but you might be waiting there longer than it would take you just to walk to the subway stop. The pool area was nice, but I didn't see any changing rooms in the locker area. Did I miss that or something? Before you go into the locker rooms, you have to grab a towel from the pool desk because that's the only place they're located. This is one of the best indoor pools I've seen at a hotel. It goes from 3' deep to 9' deep and it's heated. The whirlpool bath is also nice, but really hot. The pool maintenance guys told us that they check the water quality and temp. every two hours to make sure everything is good. There is also a steam room and sauna in the locker rooms. Workout area was closed while we were there. I did not use any of the hotel dining but there is a first floor restaurant called Mizzen and a top floor restaurant called Toula.

My rate was US$79 + tax (and booking fee) for one person (US$96.95). My journey from Pearson to the hotel was accomplished by travel on the Airport Express bus. Fast and efficient service (especially when you're the first off the bus!). Judging by some of the reviews I'd read about the rooms, I expected a small room. However, I thought my room (22nd Floor) was large. It included a king bed, large desk/chair, sofa/love seat (pull-out bed) and a couple of large comfortable chairs, large bathroom, closet area, etc. The room faced east, overlooking a dinner boat - but it had a water-view or sorts; fine for a one-nighter. The front desk staff was attentive and professional when I checked-in/out - just what I expected from a Westin. The incidental charges for water, mini-bar, shaving kit in the bathroom (tooth brush, tooth paste, razor, shaving cream), etc., didn't offend me and I don't see why it should offend others. If you want the convenience of things you pay a premium price. There was no charge for expected toiletries of soap, conditioner and shampoo in the bathroom. The iron and ironing board came in handy. And, after reading earlier comments here, I was surprised to see the complimentary Starbucks coffee in the room (three 20oz. serving packs (making 20oz of coffee that is) together with the coffeemaker). Additional coffee supplies were available for sale from the hotel. I didn't eat in any of the restaurants, use room service, or the pool . . . but I did stop by the concierge station and found the two people to be very accommodating and sensitive/responsive to requests from the many people stopping-by to ask for assistance. The convenience store offered the basics, and was adequate (and a bit over priced as I expected it to be). If you like to walk (as I do) the hotel's location shouldn't be a bother to anybody. Busses/trolly and the subway system are not far away, either. This is a convention hotel and appears to get lots of use Monday > Friday, and that's probably why rooms are often deeply discounted on the weekend and during non-peak periods. Some things about the hotel seem to be a little worn, but for the price I paid I'd have to be a nit-picker to point the things out. On my way out of Toronto (after spending 10 days with family elsewhere in Ontario) I stayed overnight in the Travel Lodge at Pearson. My rate was CDN$90+ tax for a worn room in a hotel that was no where in the same league as the Westin. Maybe I was lucky - I got a large room and I was traveling alone (lots easier than traveling with a family/group).

The view of downtown is also good because the hotel is separated from the central business district by low buildings and a freeway.

The hotel is very close to, but offset from, downtown. Air Canada Centre is a 10-minute walk away, and a subway station a little further. The Air Canada Centre route offers safe walking to downtown, with only a couple of busy streets to cross before heading underground. Otherwise, one might take a 5-minute taxi ride. I never saw the hotel's advertised shuttle, which supposedly went to the Eaton Centre. My room was of an ordinary size and standard design. The king-size bed was superb, as was the over-large bathroom. Since the windows were sealed, I had to have the noisy air system on most of the time. The elevators were fast to my floor.

I'm a hotel snob, so I don't like to hear any negative reviews of a hotel I'm going to be staying at! After reading reviews @ TripAdvisor & Hotwire and researching hotels in downtown Toronto, I was hoping for The Hotel InterContinental, since someone had mentioned they were booked there for $85/night. Let me start by saying that The Westin Harbour Castle is a very nicely appointed hotel. The lobby and it's layout and decor are very appealing and attractive. Nothing shabby about the place at all. As hotels go, the staff is quite accomodating. We, as Hotwire purchasers, weren't treated any differently than guests who paid full price. But, why should we be, since the hotel sells these rooms to Hotwire! We were originally booked a double/double room through Hotwire for $85 (US)/night. I called the hotel myself, prior to check-in and asked if they would switch us to a king room w/sofa bed to accommodate myself, my husband and son. Upon check-in, I asked the gal at the desk if we had a \"nice\" room. She stated that our room had been upgraded to a water-view room which was a considerable upgrade. When we got to our room though, there was no sofa bed, only a king sized bed. I went back to the desk, explained the situation and was re-assigned another room with the promise of a \"comp\" to any room charges for the \"inconvienence\". We were, in the end, comped for a movie rental we purchased. As other reviewers mention, the room was small. But, it was CLEAN, fresh smelling and nicely appointed. Sometimes, looks ARE everything and IMO, if you're spending that much time in your room, you're not on vacation!! As other reviewers mentioned, there were, in addition to the keyed mini bar, two bottled waters placed on the coffee table and a toiletry kit on the bathroom sink, but honestly, I don't know how anyone who has traveled or stayed almost anywhere (especially places with an honor bar) in the past several years, could mistake a bottle of anything, with a huge hang tag of specifics on it, for an amenitiy. The hotel valet parking is $30/night. Thanks to a previous reviewers advice, we parked in a self park lot w/in and out privliges that was on the same block (same side of the street, just west of the Westin) as the hotel for $15 dollars/night. What a savings! The only fault I can find with The Westin is it's harbor front location. There really isn't too much to do or see in the general vicinity, it's mostly industrial, although you can get around via trolley, subway, etc., if you do some research. If you stay here, plan an itinerary of what you want to see in the city and how you're going to get there. If you're walking, like I did, you may want to reconsider, especially if it's an unseasonably hot August. LOL Overall, the hotel is an excellent value through Hotwire, at $85/night.

Knowing through this website about the extra items in the room that weren't included, we stayed away from the refrigerator and bathroom extras. I found it interesting that the coffee wasn't complimentary, but knowing that beforehand, I brought tea bags and used the coffee maker for hot water and soup. The front desk was very nice and helpful, especially after my wallet was stolen at the Blue Jays game. They suggested my husband fax them a copy of another credit card with permission for all hotel charges to be put on it, and he did immediately (at 1:30am). They had it in their hands within 5 minutes and we were set. So the next day, not having any cash, we swam in their pool and hung out at the hotel and ordered room service.

The travel desk downstairs had girls there that were always very helpful and pleasant to everyone, no matter if they bought a tour or not. We had planned to drive to Niagra Falls, but since it was a holiday weekend, no cars were available (a good thing anyway with my drivers license being in my wallet that was stolen) and their tours were at least $130.00 and 9 hours long. The beds were to die for, those heavenly beds are the best thing about the hotel. The pool was not busy and had plenty of comfy chairs. We tried the business center downstairs and used the internet. When we left yesterday morning at 4:40am, the airport express bus picked us up right in front of the hotel and since we were the last stop, we arrived at the airport by 5am. Plus, children under 12 ride free, something I didn't know when we arrived, so it was only $15.50 for me. Would I stay there again? I was very impressed with all the hotel staff, so absolutely yes. Now, I did get this hotel through Hotwire for $88.00 per night, so I feel we got excellent service for this.

Very pretty decorations and furniture, but overall a bit on the small side. The beds truly are heavenly. Hubby never sleeps past 5am at home, and he didn't get up until after 8am! Loved all the pillows and down blankets. Overall, the location was good. Right next door to the HarbourCentre and outdoor International Market about 1 block down. About a 15-20 min walk to the Eaton Centre. (or a $7 cab ride) Staff was very nice and friendly. Yes, the mini bar/snack basket is way too expensive but they usually are no matter where you stay. Parking was $30/day-ouch! But again, if you have ever stayed in Manhattan or LA, you expect this. The only service problems we had were the concierge and housekeeping. First the concierge: took at least 15 rings before answering the phone, then put on hold for at least 10 mins. This happened EVERY time! I inquired about tickets for Blue Man Group and he said he couldn't help me. Just gave me the theatre phone number and told me to call them! What??? Isn't the whole point of his job to do this for me? (And there was a $2 surcharge for local calls to boot!) In addition, he directed us to an Italian restaurant that was out of business. Obviously not in tune with what's happening in town. Second, housekeeping didn't make our room up until about 6pm the 1st day. They claimed we had out a DND sign on the door. The room didn't even have a DND sign! They finally came and made the beds while we went down to the pool, but didn't bring fresh towels, cups/glasses or coffee!! Had to call a 3rd time for this. Lastly, the water temp in the shower sucked big time. Bursts of hot then cold. No way to keep an even temp. Not what I would expect from a 4 star.

Also the bathrooms were pretty large all things considered. Awful closet space, more stuff in the closet, less room for clothes. The whole place just screams conference center. The location is also less than ideal, far from everything - although thank God we didn't have a car w/us, considering the other reviews here. I took taxi's everywhere, which was fine when you consider how much the parking was. The pool area was kind of a mystery, only two chairs on the sundeck had cushions, and the rest of the chairs were filthy. The jets in the whirlpool didn't seem to be in working order either. The best thing about the hotel was the spa - which is a stand alone in the hotel. Extremely friendly knowledgable staff, who took their time and were very helpful in all matters.
