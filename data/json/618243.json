{"Reviews": [{"Content": "Check before you book! This hostal is not really close to anything except one obscure metro station. I booked a room with a bathroom (ensuite) but did not know that in doing so I would be giving up a window! No outside fresh air, and no natural light. The only light in the room was a bright fluorescent light high above the bed. The ceiling fan provided NO air movement whatsoever, so the night was spent sweating and not sleeping much! If you book here, go for the shared bathroom, and request a street facing room to get a beautiful balcony.", "Date": "Jul 17, 2006", "ReviewID": "UR524005987", "Ratings": {"Service": "-1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "-1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "1", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "-1", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "Stressfree2"}, {"Content": "Seguir buscando......   showReview(17804622, 'full');", "Date": "Jul 12, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR883063704", "Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Business service": "1", "Cleanliness": "1", "Check in / front desk": "1", "Overall": "1", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "3"}, "Author": "breguet"}], "HotelInfo": {"HotelURL": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g187497-d618243-r5475037-Hostal_els_Angels-Barcelona_Catalonia.html", "HotelID": "618243", "Price": "Unkonwn"}}
