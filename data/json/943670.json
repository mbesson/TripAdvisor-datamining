And I chose this hotel because of positive feedback of guests at the booking.com. My main criteria for selection were: cleanness, location, price, room size. The hotel booked a room I requested for. BUT, when we arrived, the room was dirty and when I have talked to the reception, they tried to defend their staff, and we didn't expect that. I thought that Turkey is a client oriented, but not in this hotel, I guess. The second day my wife checked the bed frame, which was again dusty. Moreover, the cleaning staff dropped her socks to a dusty floor, which became dirty (that was unpleasant). We didn't tell anything about socks, but dust in the room to the reception. The answer we got: \"Nobody complained about that room before (are we the first??)\". Finally, after our second complaint, they cleaned up the room properly. And we paid 80 EUR/night, which is quite expensive for such type of hotel in Istanbul (we paid because of a holiday season). We paid 18 EUR for two persons for airport pick up and 10 EUR for two for drop off. The hotel arranged that on our request. Anyway, I had a bad impression about this hotel, although the location is good. Don't stay in that hotel if you care about cleanness in your hotel room! We will never stay there for sure. I will better pay extra money to stay in another hotel next time.", "Date": "January 7, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Doha, Qatar", "Title": "\u201cA FANTASTIC PLACE TO STAY\u201d", "Author": "REHMAN B", "ReviewID": "UR117926591", "Content": "Oldcity VIVA a Home far away from Home....The location is just superb which links to all the important destinations by walk as you can find a lot of shops,resturants Etc. and once you feel tired you can just hop in the tram and it will bring you very close to VIVA , The Rooms are quite spacious at a reasonable price for that location.
