I was told not to expect much but was pleasantly surprised by a massive room that could accommodate 5 (there was 4 of us). The best part was the floor to ceiling windows overlooking Changi tarmac, we literally had planes parked right outside our hotel room, this was a huge novelty to us all especially for my two kids. As soon as we woke the next morning they couldn\u2019t wait to see if any more planes had parked outside their \u2018bedroom window\u2019. The rooms are not luxurious but the hotel is not intended as a luxury hotel but a \u201ctransit\u201d hotel (hence the name). The shower did not have a floor separator in the bathroom so the floor was drenched and a bit slippery, otherwise it was fine. I believe you need to book a standard room if you want a private bathroom. I also thought the price was reasonable. There is no room service but you can literally walk into the airport terminal and grab a bite to eat / drink or shop if you haven\u2019t already done enough. Many of the eateries do start to shutdown after 10pm in T1 but you should find something basic. There is also a pool in T1 that guests can use (we didn\u2019t due to time). A very good option of you are in transit for a few hours or overnight. You don\u2019t even have to clear customs, you literally walk off the plane and into your hotel, there is a Transit hotel in each terminal so you can choose based upon which terminal you are flying in and out of or which hotel/airport amenities you wish to be near. Even if you are flying in/out of a different terminals it is only a quick Skytrain ride between terminals. Tip! As you do not clear customs in Changi remember to pack your PJ\u2019s, toiletries, medications, change of clothes etc in your carry-on bag as your larger luggage will be checked through to your next destination.

Also, as previous posters have mentioned, you cannot check into this airport unless you have checked in to your flight and go through immigration yourself. However there are ways to go through around this rule. What we did on our 12 hour lay over on our return flight to Auckland was to pass through Immigration and retrieve our luggage. On the arrivals section of Terminal 1 we took the walkalator down to basement level 2 and deposited our 5 pieces of luggage on the Left Baggage section. It costs around 25 Singaporean dollars for our 5 pieces of luggage and the fee is for a 24 hour deposit. It will cost more if you have luggage of unusual shapes (surfboards and the like). Took the cab to the CBD and for the first 5 hours of our lay over we made some last minute sightseeing (as malls open at 11 am), then shopping and lunch. We took the cab again to the airport and luckily JetStar had an early check in counter so we were able to retrieve our baggage from the Left Baggage, checked them in, pass through immigration, then checked into the hotel. It took quite a bit of time to check in since we did not have reservation and there were construction works going on but you will appreciate the fact that for 4 to 5 hours you a lying down on a bed with pillows. With the Chilean volcanic ash cancelling flights to and from Australia or New Zealand, the departure section was quite full so we thought of trying our luck with the hotel so that we can have some bit of rest and charge our phones, laptop and tablet in relative comfort and security. Rooms are booked by 6 hour blocks and they will insist on giving you a wake up call 2 to 1.5 hours before boarding time to give you time to wake up and have a shower. Yes, the rooms are nothing fancy but all you need is a bed and some pillows to catch some zzzzzzz before you take your next flight. We had a good 4 hour snooze before the concierge made the wake up call. The bath has a tandem shower/bath, with clean towels, shampoo/conditioner dispenser and the usual accoutrements but surprisingly, no toothbrush and toothpaste (you have to call room service for them, and they are complimentary).

So I believe that as soon as upgrading works end, the sleep quality will be again as good as it was the first time I stayed here.

Actually Changi Airport Terminal One is almost like a city where it seems that it is possible to satisfy almost all your needs. Something I also like to stress is that the hotel will not ask for your credit card details when making a booking. They just tell you that they will keep your room during 1 hour after your flight lands, so you have enough time to show up and register. Finally, remember not to clear immigration/customs when arriving because the hotel is situated within the transit area. So if you must fly with another company after your stay at the hotel, clear immigration/customs only after your stay and then go to the \"Lost & Found\" counter to pick up your luggage (if your connecting flight is operated by the same company, they will probably just put your luggage in your next plane and, in this case, you won't need to clear immigration/customs.

The staff are OK but you really don't interact with them other than checking in. No room service but there are places to eat 24hrs a day within a few minutes walk in the terminal. The major problem with this hotel is getting a confirmed reservation. They are at least ten years behind the times with their reservation system and it is a hassle. I use their on line booking system first but if there is no reply within 48 hours I just call and almost always get a room if I book more than a couple of weeks in advance. There is usually a sorry crowd of walk in (no confirmed reservation) travellers hoping to get a room waiting miserably at the reservation desk. Don't let it happen to you. One trick if they are full is to simply use the rest lounge and shower facility just adjacent to the the Terminal 3 hotel. You can pay by the hour for a nap and take a shower if they don't have a hotel room.

I am glad that I chose this option, rather than trying to cram in some Singapore sightseeing \u2013 even though I have never visited this city before. Herewith my notes which I hope will be useful to others planning to book here: 1.Persevere with the booking, accept they are slow and send a second mail 24 hours after the first, or phone the number on the hotel website, it is worth it! 2.Booking is confirmed by email and no deposit is required, a printout of the confirmation needs to be shown on arrival 3.The hotel has two outlets, at Terminal 2 and Terminal 3, the latter has been completed in 2008 and is apparently newer. We stayed in the older Terminal 2 and it was more than adequate. 4.Do not expect modern chic, in contrast with the rest of the airport, the hotel rooms reflect the 70\u2019s comfort, it\u2019s the d\u00e9cor that is dated, not the appliances, beds or linen. (see my photos) 5.Pack all you need in your hand luggage as you will be unable to collect your checked in luggage. 6.Your checked in luggage will automatically be stored while you are in transit, and when checking in for your onward flight, it will be forwarded to that flight. See point 9. 7.Do not clear immigration, take the Sky Train to your appointed Terminal and follow the clear signposts to the hotel on the first floor. 8.Do not delay to book in, whilst the hotel allows for delays they are not bound to wait longer than reasonable before giving your room to someone else. Remember you pay no deposit, so many people don\u2019t turn up, whilst lots of people without bookings also come to ask for rooms. Leave shopping and eating for after you have booked in. 9.You can get your boarding ticket and arrange onward luggage for your ongoing flight at a Transfer Desk close to the Hotel (ask at reception), no matter how many hours you are spending in transit, prior to tucking into bed. I highly recommend doing this. It means you can sleep in longer and don\u2019t have any rush on waking up. You will just have to check which Gate you will be boarding, as this only gets allocated an hour or two prior to take off. 10.We booked and on arrival paid for a double room but were allocate a triple room. Here we found a comfortable double bed as well as a single bed in a spacious bedroom. Mattresses and pillows (one each) were good and linen was clean and crisp. There were two bedside tables with big reading lamps, a telephone as well as two tub chairs.(see room photo). The dressing table with mirror, housed a large TV.on top and a kettle with tea, coffee, sugar and milk powder sachets. We found a hair dryer in the drawer. (See dressing table photo) The information brochure informed you that you could, if needed, request a toothbrush and paste, as well as a sewing kit, from reception, depending on availability. There were hooks to hang your clothes and ample space floor space for your hand luggage. The room had no window, but this did not bother us as the air conditioner worked very well. 11.The bathroom mirror spanned the width of the basin vanity and there was a shaver plug. We had a bath (bliss!) and a shower over the bath. (see bathroom photo) The showerhead gave a good strong jet and water was sufficiently hot. The bathroom was equipped with hotel style soap, shampoo and shower cap and there was a standard size face and hand towel for each person. 12.We received two wake up calls from reception, allowing for 30 minutes to clear the room (you can request a wake up call at your chosen time) 13.There are lots of 24 hour cafes, coffees shops, restaurants and shops nearby.

The rate of S$55 or so for an ensuite room was fine, although in fairness Fragrance hotels 25 minutes away by MRT metro train and a 7 minute walk are the same price for 24 hours, not just 6. Ambassador Transit's room was spotless. Even the bathroom had been properly cleaned, and the bed linen was immaculate. But the best feature was despite it being a transit hotel with passengers coming and going all night, there was no noise whatsover. Yes, the hotel is windowless, but let's face it, most users just want to sleep between flights in cattle class. This hotel is well designed and is recommended.", "Date": "April 13, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "3", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Sydney, Australia", "Title": "\u201cTerminal 3 - Brand New\u201d", "Author": "TravellingCarlito", "ReviewID": "UR14976739", "Content": "I was very impressed with the Transit Hotel in terminal 3. I had read the reviews about the other Transit Hotels in Changi and hadn't kept any high expectations before checking into this one. Being a relatively new terminal, the state of the hotel was in perfect working order. The reception is modest, with only a small desk and a couple of tables and chairs. The check-in process was basic but efficient. The reception are very helpful, willing to attend to any request I had. The room I was given was a twin room, so it was big enough for a single person. You will find a plasma TV in the room, with basic cable channels. The beds are a lot more comfortable than they appear. The pillows are nice and plush. The bathroom is also quite spacious. Modern and clean, just like the rest of the room and the hotel. My room also had a view of the runway, which was great. I had no issues with noise, thanks to the double glazed windows of the hotel and the terminal. No breakfast is served here, as there are plenty of options outside the hotel to eat. Wake-up service is available if you need. There is also internet available within the hotel, where you can connect to their wireless internet from the room or use the PCs at reception. However, there is a fee. But since Changi airport has free wi-fi and PCs to use, why pay for it? That being said, the free wi-fi can't be accessed from the rooms, so you will need to leave your room to access it. Overall, if you need a hotel whilst transitting in Changi, I highly recommend this hotel in Terminal 3. You can even leave the terminal to go to the city if you really want to do a spot of shopping or eating before you catch up on sleep at the terminal.", "Date": "April 12, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Piazza San Piedro", "Title": "\u201cLong Haul Relief\u201d", "Author": "Please_upgrade", "ReviewID": "UR14884408", "Content": "We had a 7-hr transit stop enroute from Melbourne to London on Singapore Airlines.
