Never had a Murphy bed before. we also had a kitchen complete with range, microwave, dishwasher - we didn't really use anything but the fridge (it was only a 1 night stay), and a decent sized bedroom with 2 comfortable beds - I slept like a baby, a vanity, and a back patio with sliders (I would recommend 2nd fl if u are worried about safety - I liked the first floor, easy access) Positives: LOCATION, I wanted some place we could have activities outside our door - it doesn't get any closer than Celebration Suites - Old town and Fun Spot are literally steps away. My kids enjoyed the pool. I liked the bed and pillow comfort- I enjoyed having a seperate bed for each of my 2 kids, after staying at WDW value resorts the last few times it was nice to have 4 times the space - not to mention a fridge and a microwave. We ate at a decent buffet across the street, but many many options for eat and drink! Also 1.5 mi from Disney - we were there in 10 mins the next am! Negative: Hotel is run down from the outside, some rooms I would be very worried about safety. Satellite cable sucked big time in the bedroom, very fuzzy.

We moved after our first night (with absolutely no arguments, they didn't seem surprised we were asking to move) to one further away from the fair and main road. The rooms are large, although the bathroom is quite small, the master Bed is firm, which is far better than the normal saggy mattresses in most cheap accommodation. Yes, you do have to ask for plates etc when you arrive it's not automatically in the room. The people I booked through, this was included in the price, as was the nightly resort fee. I know some reviews say it's $50 for plates, when we arrived the paperwork said $10.75 including tax. When you book, check if this is included or not. There's no kettle or toaster or oven in the kitchen, just a coffee machine /microwave / dishwasher / 2 ring hob / huge fridge. Wifi is available in the rooms for $12.50 a week - although there was no signal in our first room for it. Celebration Suites is on the main links to all the major attractions and they do have a free bus to most of them, the bus runs once a day to and once a day from each of the main parks. We've not tried it as we have a hire car, but plenty of people were standing at the bus stop so it looks quite well used and reliable. I think the only downside is the large windows at either end of the apartment are fairly well overlooked, so most of the time the curtains are closed.

For the past four trips, we have stayed at Celebration Suites (formerly Old Town Suites). I considered booking a house this time but my children wanted to stay next to Old Town again. The very simple truth about Celebration Suites is this. It is an older place so don't expect a dishwasher or a five star hotel. We like it because it's familiar and we like returning to the place where we went when our children were little. The biggest problem I've ever had was asking for an additional chair in the sitting area. I've never experienced anything negative. This year for the first time we rented a 2 bedroom suite and I couldn't have been more pleased. Although there were only six of us, we could have slept 12 in the suite! If you need to save a little money like us after paying for Universal Studios tickets, then this hotel may work for you. Once my family and I check in, we are in our own little world. So, our routine never changes. Check in to our room, run to Publix for groceries, visit Old Town the first night and hit the park the next day.

This time we did something different and stayed at the Celebration Suites. Overall, I'd have to say this is very much worth a serious look for families looking for an extended stay in the Orlando / Kissimmee area. It is an older hotel- looks like it was probably built in the 1960's. However- the room we stayed in was VERY large- easily 40 or 50% larger than a standard hotel room. It had a small kitchen with a stove, coffee maker, microwave and a full sized refrigerator. The mattress and the linens were actually quite good for a value hotel- we slept like rocks all weekend long. Our room had a full sized bath and GOBS of hot water- which was also very nice. The rooms appear to have been recently refreshed with contemporary furniture and decor- I was not crazy about the buttery yellow walls and ceiling, and the kitchen needs silverware, pots and pans, and a paper towel holder to make it fully useable. Location is great for people going to disney or staying in the Orlando area- it's a stone's throw from Old Towne and Fun Spot and a variety of activities and restaurants for the entire family.

Upon purchase he noted that he paid for two tickets but the receipt only read one ticket. The woman at the counter assured him this was typical.

Upon return to Celebration Suites we were again instructed to go the the hotel next door. We waited for hours to try and get the situation straightend out. In the end, we were told they would check into it and refund the money to our credit card, as we had proof that our card was charged for two tickets. Two years later, we have not heard from anyone about the trouble this caused and no refund.

However the staff are all lovely. Always answered calls promptly, always helpful and as in life things need fixing, maintenance came in around 5 mins and the beds and pillows are truly comfy. One night we forgot the car window down and found it in the morning just as we left it. in fact the only reason I haven't given a rate of 5 is we did not have a carpeted room - only lino which I don't recall seeing in their pictures (I could be wrong) and housekeeping do need to give the floor a good sweep/wipe. There also was not a single picture hung in the suite anywhere which would have been nice and I've seen a mirror on walls by the kitchen in photos by others, again we didn't have that which would have been useful.

Paid for internet which properly mucked us about for first few days but spoke to/complained to outside company and lady took it onboard and did sort it out. Also last time I used laundry only 1 out of 6 maybe 8 washers worked so had to go to block further away. The helpful repairer guy from the outside company was working on those washers. Mentioned those to him and before I went to dry my loads I passed the first laundry and saw all the machine displays showing properly.

To me if they would clean the rooms as good as they cleaned the lobby everything would look great besides the outdated furniture & TV's. To me the shuttle service was the worst part of the stay. The driver would rope off seats with an extension cord so that no one could sit in those seats. However once everyone was loaded up and standing we would go to the next hotel and he would give them the seats. Same thing in the evening when getting picked up he would call out the name of some Villa place and they would get on the bus first so they were guaranteed seats. The shuttle buses didnt use their air it was hot and miserable. At one point the bus driver took one of the passengers cameras and was taking pictures for her while he was driving putting all of his riders in danger. By the way he had a nasty attitude. The buses sounded like they were going to break down everytime we rode them.

He met me in the lobby where he shook my hand and put his arm around me and pulled me way too close.

His attempt to fixing this was sending a maintenance guy to our room with a vacuum cleaner who handed us sheets for us to change, and saying that the toilet seat could not be fixed bc they don't have another. We stayed only the 1 awful night because it was already midnight at this point and we had 3 kids with us, but we ran out of there the next day and went to Hawthorne Suites instead which, for the same price, provided a totally different experience.

Everything I researched online said it was great, minus a few bad reviews. Got to our hotel late on Saturday night. Checked in and unloaded our belongings.

I looked at the murphy bed that you could pull down in the living room area and took pics of what I could not believe the dirt and filth. The kitchen smells like mildew and mold. I told the front desk about our room on Saturday night and they said they could move us. With so much stuff that we had and had already unpacked (it was already 3am), I told them we would stay in this room and please have someone come clean it in the morning. Was getting ready to leave for the theme parks and the maid came in. Told her to come back in 1 hour and we would be gone. Got back to the hotel that night around 11pm and our room was not cleaned at all. Called the front desk and told them of this. They did come and empty out the trash and that was it. We were in our room for 2 days before someone came and cleaned it. Food under the table still there for 2 days. I let the front desk know and the Director of Operations said they would take a look at my bill and adjust it. Needless to say our bill was already paid for and they couldn't do anything about it but to give us a free night in the future.

Where to begin? For starters, I read the reviews on this place before our trip so I knew what to bring...ie, pots, pans, dishes etc. Unfortunately we only cooked in the suite 1 time...reason being - we made breakfast the first morning we were there, and then left to go to the race at Daytona. When we returned, I realized that although we had turned the stove knobs to off, the stove was indeed still on and a pan of bacon grease was on one of those burners !! We ended up turning it off at the breaker to ensure that it was really off. We reported this to the front desk twice and I'm pretty sure no one bothered to make a note of this. Room 1371 for managements information. It was only dumb luck that the place did not catch fire. The knobs on the stove were not original to the stove and were actually from an oven. We realized this because they had a broil setting on them. Our opinion was that this was probably not an intelligent idea on that part of the staff to replace the knobs with ones that did not fit properly, and as a matter of fact a hotel had burned down just up the street the week prior. As for the cleaning, pretty much non-existant. Sure they will bring you clean towels and change the garbage bags - most days - but the vaccumming is never done and the floors are never swept or mopped. When we asked for our room to be cleaned, the maid told us she did not speak english. We found some bugs in the room, but we expected that considering we were in the south. We paid for an \"updated room\" but the updates went as far as new paint on the wall and a new carpet. Old furnature, a broken couch, faulty stove and chairs with rips and stains on them is what we got. Also the fridges in both unit we rented froze everything we put in them. The grounds were very poorly maintained with trash on the ground all over. The security is on duty all the time as there are a lot of undesirables in the area. Most of the nightly problems seem to stem from people that are not even guests of the hotel but local kids that wander aimlessly at all hours of the night and day. For the money we spent and the time that we were actually there, it was so-so. Nothing special thats for sure. A decent place to shower and sleep and that's about it. The hotel was conviently located on the strip and having Old Town next door was nice. The rooms are spacious for a family but far from clean so plan on doing your own cleaning. Personally I think the hotel should: #1 - put up fences around the \"resort\" and # 2 - fire the maid service supervisor who is definitely not teaching her staff the proper way to clean a room. Pool area was unclean with garbage and dirty towels left on the deck. With the amount of people that we always in the pool we found it better to not use the pool. One good thing is that the air conditioners worked very well in the room. Price was the only good thing about this place.

Here\u2019s a summary of our stay at Celebration Suites: Prior to arrival we received an email from Celebration Suites offering us an early arrival guarantee for $20 when we got there. The check-in time is 4pm so, of course, we wanted early arrival. Upon arrival we were directed to our second floor, barracks-like \u201csuite\u201d passing by essentially an empty barracks complex (so much for early arrival necessity). The look of the place: The State of Florida needs to regulate the marketing of hotels/motels in the Orlando area. The word \u201csuite\u201d should not be allowed when describing the grotesque and filthy appearance of Celebration Suites. After opening the \u201csuite\u201d door with only one of the two keycards that actually worked, we were faced with a dirty old room that, at first glance, did provide the basics of a suite. After \u201cliving\u201d there for a few minutes, we realized it provided only aggravation. Here is a synopsis of the \u201camenities (another word that shouldn\u2019t be allowed!):\u201d A broken stove, a broken hairdryer, a broken and incredibly noisy refrigerator, an air conditioner out of Paranormal Activity striking fear throughout the night, a broken coffee maker (not found out until the first morning when we needed it after a fitful night\u2019s sleep caused by the air conditioner), and a clogging toilet. Really bad. So, we complained to the manager and additional staff who, of course, argued with us, made excuses, and implied that we were in the wrong. Need I say more? Ok one last note: If this was a place that was $40-$50 per night, I could forgive some of the inconvenience. But this place ended up costing $80+ per night. Not much, but after driving by some of their competition you can do a whole lot better the Celebration Suites. This place is a miserable rat hole.

We choose Celebration Suites as our preffered hotel because all of the rooms were suites and large enough to accomodate up to six people at an AMAZING PRICE. Our suite included a huge living room, a full kitchen so we could cook, as well as a seperate bedroom which offered some privacy, unlike most hotels. This was great because our girlfriends came along with us. The staff at Celebration Suites were very proffesional and friendly. They offered us a free mouse pad and coffee mug when we checked in, which went above and beyond my expectations. The housekeeping staff did an excellent job cleaning our room, and the front desk staff always had answers for the many questions we had regarding disney. They were also very effective in responding to our every need. I highly recommend Celebration Suites as your place to stay when visiting the Kissimmee/ Orlando area.

This was very very cheap. for more than 10 years now i will only book hotels after reading tripadvisor reviews. I base everything on these reviews. This hotel got so many good and excellent reviews that I was overly excited about this deal. we arrived in FL at 11:00 PM tired and wanting a bed to sleep in asap. we checked into this hotel and got a room. At first sight i was not impressed with the external appearance of the hotel. It looked old but you never know whats inside. I've been surprised before. The room was old and made me quite uncomfortable immedaitely. the kitchen cabinets, floor, carpets, walls, furniture, everything - was old and either cracked, chipped or peeling. I figured that for what i paid - this is what there is and its fine. I'm really not picky. all i want is clean. we unpacked our things and i went to the bathroom. there was a roach climbing on the wall. When i looked a little more there were a few other bugs there too. We spoke to Wendel at the front desk and he was very nice. apologized and said he would give us another room which was renovated and upgraded. I figured he was giving us the best room he had to make up for the roach incident. Second room was same as first but with new carpet. New carpet doesnt make up for old everything else and most especially a dirty toilet. Obviously - the cleaning staff is not doing a very good job. wendel offered to show us 5 other rooms but at that point i was pretty disgusted and was just itching all over and wanted a refund. he told expedia they would refund the full amount and that was that. wendel was very proffessional and nice and i thank him for that. My suggestion for this hotel: the rooms need some serious upgrading and work. Its not just about changing the carpets. Everything in the rooms needs to be updated and new. The furniture is old, kitchen is old (everything about it) bathtubs are chipped and cracked, countertops are old and discolored and cracked. Even for someone with standards that are not high - its not a great feeling to stay somewhere where everything is old and in bad shape.

It ended up being this one. The place has a lot of potential. I really liked the size of the rooms and the fact that it had a kitchen, living room and bedroom. It was nice to have a separate space for the kids to take a nap or go to bed early. It was convenient to Disney World as well. If only the rooms were taken better care of and updated better it would be a really great place. Unfortunately it needs some serious work. I had read the reviews on here before checking in, so as soon as we got there I checked our room to see what I would find. I was nervous about the complaints of bugs, etc. I was not at all impressed with my quick walk around. The kitchen floor was quite dirty and cracked, peeling stained wallpaper, the interior of the fridge was very rusty. There were multiple hairs on ALL three of the sink/counter areas (kitchen, bathroom and bedroom vanity). The couches and chairs were stained as well as the carpet. When I walked in the radio on the alarm clock was blaring as loud as possible on a very uninviting station, and the alarm it self was so ancient, as was everything else. I was thoroughly unimpressed so we went back to the front desk and asked if they had any better rooms. The person acted shocked and incredulous when I informed him that the room seemed dirty and there were hairs on all the counters, but he willingly switched us rooms to two doors down. The next room was a slight improvement, the fridge was in better condition, the alarm clock, coffee maker and other appliances were a little more updated. The kitchen floor was less cracked, although it was still not clean to my standards. It looked like the maids probably just push a mop around once quickly, not bothering to get into corners or do anything more than that. With the room being so old that leaves a lot of grime build up. In the bathroom the tub was stained, the toilet cracked, and the mirror was missing huge spots of the reflective backing. The sofa and living room chairs were very stained, as well as the carpet. The sofa was a sleeper sofa without the mattress in it, this made the cushions sink way down in an awkward way. The sheets on the bed were quite stained and yellowed, I could hardly bring myself to crawl into them at night. Luckily I had brought my own pillow so I didn't have to put my face on them. Also, both rooms were missing the numbers outside the door, so it took us a minute to figure out which one it was. I have three young children including one toddler who still sometimes crawls around a bit, and it really gave me the willeys to have her crawl on the dirty floor. I would not recommend this place at all for very young children who don't know to stay off the floor. I was very glad we were only using the room as a place to crash at night, it would not be a place I would want to spend time in. It was nice having a full size fridge and freezer to keep food in so we could eat breakfast and make things to take with us for lunches and snacks. I really wanted the hotel to work out better. Like I said in the beginning it has really great potential. If our room had been remodeled and clean it would have been a great place to stay. Unfortunately the way it was is unacceptable. Having said all that there may be a chance that some rooms are better than what we had. I read that they are supposedly replacing the carpets right now. Also, there was a section of buildings in an area by the front office, and another section across the street. We were in the ones across the street and it is possible that the ones by the front office might be a little more presentable, but I don't know. I do think that we got what we paid for (which was less than thirty). However, I would have been very upset had I paid the sixty dollars or so that the rooms were going for online. This hotel is definitely not the 2 1/2 stars listed on hotwire. And the funny thing is if you go to the hotels website and click on the powerpoint show it says \"what follows are details of the amenities which clearly make us three stars.\" Ummmm, it doesn't really matter what kind of \"amenities\" you offer if your rooms are that dumpy there is no way you can be three stars. Also, the TVs got very few channels, on Saturday morning when I was trying to entertain my kids while the rest of us got ready we could not even find any kids shows except one in Spanish. The internet did work but it was an extra fee everyday. We never took advantage of the breakfast. For $1.50 each you could choose four items such as a banana, granola bar, donut, oj, or other cheap prepackaged stuff. We preferred to use our fridge and eat in our room. Also, there is a $5/per day \"resort fee\" that is not included in your room rate. I think this hotel might be ok for someone if they got a good enough price and they were not picky about cleanliness. If they redid the rooms and cleaned them better I would be all for staying here because of the size and convenience, but until then I will be staying away.", "Date": "February 8, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Port Charlotte, Florida", "Title": "\u201cCelebration Suites has came a long way from 2 years ago!\u201d", "Author": "kiml3818", "ReviewID": "UR95420724", "Content": "We were there last weekend and Celebration Suites is doing a great job improving the place we have been staying there for the past 14 years was nice as Days suites NASTY as suites at old town and becoming SUPER NICE as Celebration suites Keep up the good work I cant wait to come and stay again.

When we first arrived, it took us a good 20 minutes to find our room because the room number had fallen off and no one had replaced it. The walls were super thin, you could hear the person snoring in the room next to you. The place was more like somewhere you would party hard at with a bunch of your friends, not take your family. The carpets were stained and looked like they had not been cleaned in years. I left my shoes on the entire time I was there. The room had a nice sized kitchen but if you wanted something to cook in you had to rent it from the front office. If you like to watch TV, forget about it here. There were only about 10 channels that came in clearly and the TV's were very, very old and small. The TV in the bedroom didn't even have a remote control. There is also no internet connection in any of the hotel rooms. If you want to connect you have to go to their \"business center\". When I went to take a shower the whole faucet came out of the wall. It went back in, thank god, but I had to be careful turning the shower on and off. There was also absolutely no water pressure in the shower or the sinks. Also, as we were packing up to leave the toilet just stopped flushing for no reason. The hotel is literally 20ft from Old Town, which is like a little fair. Friday and Saturday nights it was a nightmare; There was no parking anywhere near our hotel room because people going to Old Town had parked in the hotel parking lot. All throughout the night you can hear people screaming on the rides. There were also many people that were loud and obnoxious just hanging out in the parking lot near the hotel rooms. If you are a girl, don't even try to walk around at night or even go out onto your patio by yourself because you will be yelled at and followed by the guys lingering in the parking lot.

Everyday our beds were made to no type of standard, our floor was never vacuumed and trash was emptied but no garbage bag was left in the can. I had to actually go outside and get a bag from the big trash can in front of our room. Everyday we came back to the room, it appeared as if the service personnel onyl changed the towels he or she could visually see then left out. I remember specifically a rag hanging on the shower curtain rod that was there for two days and they never changed it. The desk where the sink was in our room was never wiped down and neither was the bathroom counter. I specifically had asked for two extra blankets and was only given one. When the service personnel came in the next morning to so call clean the room, they took that one back. Your ironing board was a waste of time, it was too small and kept flopping down. I had to iron on the bed or put a towel on the floor because it was never vacuumed so our clothes would not get dirty. The bathroom shower was protruding from the wall and it leaked all day and night, where we could barely sleep listening to the shower leaking. The water pressure was extremely low in both the bathroom sinks and kitchen. I was very dissapointed in our stay here and I would not come back or recommend this hotel to anyone else. Had I not already paid for the room in advance I would have left and went to another hotel.", "Date": "January 2, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Preston, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cexcellent value for money\u201d", "Author": "Lancashirelass39", "ReviewID": "UR90976408", "Content": "As my friend and I are both over 65yrs and do not drive, we found the location excellent.

The only reason why I veered from my routine was that I had traveled with my two pets. Granted they charge only $10 a night per pet. I paid a grand total of $97 for one single night which consisted of exactly 10 hours. I found the hotel to be Old, destroyed, the room I had had disgusting carpets and a dirty kitchen floor. I was beyond myself. The genius at the front desk thought it was a good idea to put us on the second floor so that walking the dogs as I do several times would be more of a challenge and a better excersise. The place was a ghost town as well as totally an old town. Not even my dogs who had spent the day before at the groomers getting cleaned and beautiful wanted to walk inside or outside of the place. If you are used to staying in Cheap old hotels I guess this would be a great deal. For $1.50 you get four small little packets of snacks like those that come in multiple packets at BJ's or Costco and the worst coffee I have ever tasted in my life. I slept with the lights on just to discourage any Mexican cucarachas from coming out of their nest during the night. And no, I did not see any bugs, thank god for that! Old, in need of a total renovation a la American style, like taking down that old wall paper which is screams at the corners to be released from decades of being on the wall and that rug which can take not one more monthly vacumn. The Murphy Beds one day are going to come down and stay off their corroded hinges. Everything is rusted, holes in the corners, doors eaten up by who knows what... The only celebration in Celebration suites is the dance you do once you rush out of little Tijuana as I like to call it. I am Cuban by the way and having traveled to both Central and South American I can tell you this people think of their stars on the basis of South American stars. Yes there's a roof above your head and I don't know if it can contain the rain in a diluge. I hated the place and No never would I return to such a dilapidated property. In fairness of review, my sister felt it was ok, of course she was not aware of the $97 I had paid. How can you make it better??

We were there for 4 nights during the week of Thanksgiving to visit Disney and also took the grand kids to Old Town and Fun Spot USA, which are both right next door and which they absolutely love. I became a member of their Facebook fan page and I had read about the improvements they were making. I also saw pictures posted of the new game room, children's playground, basketball court, business center, and gym. None of these were there the last time we stayed about 3 years ago. We reserved a Superior suite with a King-sized bed in the bedroom - these are new to the hotel because it did not offer King-sized beds the last time we were here. Wow, was it comfortable! Our grand kids are 6 & 8 year's old and they slept in the pull-down bed in the bedroom which also you could see had a new mattress. We all slept very well and there were 6 pillows in our room - we loved that. Check-in was smooth and the front desk agent who greeted us, Jose, was extremely pleasant. We told him we really liked the new look of the lobby which has been re-done very tastefully and he welcomed us back like we were old friends. The rooms here are very spacious and ours was clean and had no odor to it. I've read many complaints about noise here, but can say that since this hotel is so large, there are plenty of rooms close to Old Town for those who prefer to be close to the action as well as rooms further away where you won't hear a peep. We were located in Bldg. A and noise wasn't an issue when we were there. Pools were heated and were very nice and clean. I read on Facebook that new carpets are coming in a few months...I can only imagine how much better it will be next time we bring the kids to Orlando which will probably be during Spring break holiday.

We stayed at the celebration suites and I was a little apprehensive to be honest after reading a few reviews, mainly around the cleanliness, but decided to stay here as it was the best value/location for a room sleeping 3 and we didn't plan on being in the room very much as it was just a place to crash out at night. I booked through a website that gave me a very good rate, not direct from their own website. We were greeted at check in by a very nice lady called Jean who got us processed and in our room in short time, explaining that should we need wifi that was extra ($12 for the week which I had already checked out) or cutlery which we could order now (we didn't bother). We had a 1 bedroom superior suite which was very clean and had all the basics such as fridge, cooker, microwave and table to eat at in the kitchen although if you had more than 4 or 5 people it would have been a bit of a squeeze around the table. The bedroom had 2 double beds, a tv and doors leading out onto a balcony and the mainroom had a murphy bed that the 3rd member of the party slept in also with a tv and a sofa that was probably a sofa bed, although we didn't open it. We didn't end up using any of the 3 pools, I did dip my feet in one and it was at a pleasantly warm and clean looking. All round although the rooms were basic, they were Clean with good facilities and fantastic location, you could not possibly get closer to old town!. Last year there were only 2 of us and we stayed at the sera lago about 2 mins away which was also good and I wouldn't put people off of it, but this will be my 1st choice should we return as you get a 1 bedroom suite for the same price as a studio in sera lago. As a note, although the wifi was not free it was good enough to stream the football on my laptop so the connection must be pretty good, and anyone staying around oldtown should try Logans Roadhouse for dinner...

You should feel safe at a place where you pay to stay and I was everything but, and it states in the room for your safety walk in pairs, what resort states that. This place is one of thta worst places that we ever stayed at. The don't let smokers smoke, but they let pets stay here does that make sense animals, have fleas can go on the rugs etc. But thats fine with them. Their cleaning staff is another thing, yes we had our clean towels everyday, but I don't think that they own a mop, broom or cleaning supplies. Our bathroom floor or bathroom was never cleaned the entire time we were there. I cleaned the toilet/floor/tub. What kind of S--T is that ,I'm on vacation I can stay home and clean! I advise anyone thinking of staying here DON\"T. There are alot of other resorts right around the area that are cleanier and nicer then this, STAY THERE NOT HERE!!! I would not allow my worst enemy to stay at this place. MY advice to this place CLOSE down. Spend some money on advertising that you are SMOKE_FREE and that you no longer look like you do on your web sit eand that you are actually a welfare place. our establishment is just one big false advertisement.

This time, not so much so. I prepaid back in June for an August visit and received a 20 % discount by doing so. After driving for 17 plus hours, we finally checked into the hotel around 3:00 am and were given an obviously un-renovated room which stunk of old, mold, mildew (and use your imagination). The furniture was disgusting, the blankets/ sheets were dirty and the foldout bed which the kids were so looking forward to had dirt and hair behind it. The stench was so strong, it made it hard to breathe which concerned me with my asthmatic daughter but I felt we had no choice at that point but to stay for the night. We slept for a very short time, enough to recharge our batteries and I was back in the lobby by 8 am advising them that I was checking out and would like a refund at which point the manager on duty told me that there were no refunds granted because I prepaid and received the 20% discount. She stated that I could stay or I could go but no money would be refunded. I told her that I had an asthmatic daughter and that staying there would be detrimental to her at which point she agreed to reimburse me $459 of the original $618 paid (explaining that she was charging me for the night we stayed, as well as the next night because I did not cancel 24 hours ahead of time). I took what I could get at that point and felt I would deal with the attorney general after my vacation. When I checked my bank account to make sure that they reimbursed the money, I realized that they had placed another hold for $618.00 on my account. Apparently the night time clerk had considered us a no show because we checked in after midnight and he re-charged the account (which had already been paid in full!) I went back over to the office and after much ado they faxed a letter to my bank telling them to release the second lien on my account. You would think that we could get on with our vacation at this point, right? I mean, I've already had to fight for a (partial...) refund on a room that I literally spent 6 hours in, had to have a second charge removed for failing to show up when I did... But NO... Now a few days later, I call my bank only to find out that they charged my account again for $532. So I go back to the hotel, talk to the manager on duty who informs me that even though I am showing him a statement from my bank with they have taken over $1150 dollars from my account (on two separate occasions), that it is my bank holding the money, not them. He than threatened to call the sheriffs office on me if I didn't leave. This may have been in part to him also dealing with at least three other irate customers at the same time. I left, only to go back the following day, talk to the manager on duty and a very sweet SMART young lady who was able to understand it all and refund me ALL of the money owed to me. While my distress was somewhat diminished by the favorable outcome and the reimbursement of all the money (including the night we stayed and the night we left), I still think that people should be forewarned that this place is a nightmare!

Basically you get what you pay for. \uf0fc Excellent location for evening entertainment in Old Town \uf0fc Easy access to restaurants \uf0fc Rooms clean but outdated so can put you off if you are not used to staying in a 2 star hotel Large rooms \uf0fc Swimming Pool was okay \uf0fc Reception area nice \uf0fc Free Parking on site \uf0fc Beds comfortable \uf0fc Cleaners do a good job \uf0fc Hotel staff average Negative \uf0fc Whilst the hotel is in a prime location the facilities are in need of upgrading. We stayed in one of the newer suite Block D, so we were told. The room was clean but needed updating. The TV is old and outdated. My kids were unable to connect their Xbox as the TV was too old (However you get what you pay for. If you want the Marriott\u2019s you have to pay more) \uf0fc Free Shuttle to Universal picks you up at 7:55am and departs Universal at 7:15pm. If you want to travel at any other time you have to make your own way. \uf0fc Breakfast is very basic and limited. \u2013 Not continental \uf0fc Poor Air conditioning \uf0fc Bed lining very off putting but clean Tips \uf0fc Best to have your own transportation, as travelling around in Taxi\u2019s can be very expensive. Whilst the bus runs frequently you have to take more than one bus if you want to get to the mall or shopping outlet \uf0fc Try not to use the Internet in the reception, as it can be very expensive. There is an Internet caf\u00e9 about 5 minutes away near. Free wi-fi is available in Denny\u2019s and Macdonald Suggestion for Management \uf0d8 Being in an excellent location you should spend more on upgrading the facilities and d\u00e9cor of the building even if you have to reflect this in the price \uf0d8 Offer free Wi-fi \uf0d8 Invest in some decent bed lining and carpeting \u2013 brown can be very off putting and looks cheap \uf0d8 Get your staff to take responsibility when things go wrong.

Dog friendly. ( I wont stay anywhere that isnt ) Inexpensive THE BAD The $5 resort fee truly is a scam.. Why do I have to pay $5 extra ? Dont I pay enough for the room as it is with all the other additional taxes and fees ? I pre paid $5 a day for the continental breakfast for my wife and I.. The first day I went to the room where they have it, there is a picture on the door that says it is $1.50 per person. So because I prepaid, I am loosing out on $2 a day ? I thought the point of pre paying was to SAVE money, not loose it.. While I am on the topic of the breakfast. It is one of the worst I have ever eaten. Here are your choices.. Oranges, coffee, oatmeal, hot chocolate... AND behind the counter they have rice krispy squares, juice boxes, pop tarts, granola bars.. WTF kind of breakfast is that ? The internet is $5 bucks a day or $12 for the week.. In this day, people should NOT haveto pay for internet service while staying at a hotel. While I found that the internet service was fast every time I used it, I shouldnt have had to pay for it.. The first room we had, the back door didnt lock.. I went straight back to the front desk and asked to be switched to a different room, which they did.. I didnt like the fact that I had to go to the front desk everyday to get a gym key.. I sdhould have been able to use my room key.. The gym.. While I dont expect a golds gym, a few more pieces of equipment would have been nice.. I would have also apprecioated some cleaner to wipe off the equipment after I used it and sweated on it.. Paper towels and cleaners would be nice in there.. A bathroom would be great also.. Towels would be great.. The rooms are extremly outdated.. I am not lying here when I say this, that our tv had to of been from 1980, at least ! The bed was comfy, although the floors were stained in a few places.. Now, with all that beind said.. This was an inexpensive place to stay.

It took me about 50 minutes to check in as room was not ready. I requested a pool view suite (handy for kids) and was given one. I was then told the pool was closed and to use one across the street. Our suite was a good size but old - beds were good though . Kitchen was clean but needed to be replaced - fridge had rust inside. There were no plates, pots, flatware in the kitchen and it took us 2 days to get some (long and painful story) The suite has a large balcony but there are no chairs or tables and the floor of it is unpainted and has just dirty greay concrete.

Their were 5 people in my party, with 1 of them being a 3 year old. When we checked, we were told we were being given one of the upgraded suites, for no additional charge ( normally it is an additional $20 a night), which was awesome we thought. Unfortunately, the only thing that was upgraded in our suite, was the mattresses, doors and the new paint job. The negatives: The sinks were huge, but the faucets were small and required your hands to constantly hit the sink, because there was no real room between the water coming from the faucet and the edge of the sink. Our bathroom sink and bath faucet leaked and the sink had no hot water. The floors were dirty and there was no real water pressure in the shower. In the kitchen, there was no hot water in the kitchen sink and there was no water pressure. How can one wash any dishes when they are there. There was no ice tray or ice maker in the freezer, and the ice machine, didn't work for us. Be sure to bring your own plates and utensils, or you will have to pay for them while you are there. And the hood in the kitchen, which one would use when using the 2 top burner stove top, was disgusting and had not been cleaned in awhile. And then there is the bug issue, I realize it is Florida and roaches happen, they can enter to room at any point, but we found 1 roach in the kitchen, which could have been caused by the large crack between the door and the door frame. Plus right outside our room, there were wasps everywhere, we had to dart inside to avoid them. The only other negative, that I don't know how the hotel could really control, was the noise levels of the other guests. We were on the first floor and had the people above us, running and jumping all through there room late at night, and there were guest (teens), running through the hallways yelling and screaming at all hours of the night. Maybe a little security or someone monitoring the hallways at night could stop this, it seems to happen anytime we have stayed there. And the positives: It is cheap, can't go wrong with $55 a night, for a suite that sleeps 6 The new playground area, my child loved it. The exterior of the building has been painted and looked wonderful The closeness to Old Towne and the wonderful restaurants nearby was great. I highly recommend Tex Mex and Flippers We complained to the hotel staff when we checked out and the person at the desk gave us a coffee mug with candy and business cards, she could have cared less about anything. This really didn't help make things any better.

Since we only paid about $35 a night we really couldn't complain about the few minor inconveniences we came across in the week we were there. Here is the upside of the motel: 1. It has free shuttles that are available to and from the parks (Disneyworld/ Universal/ Sea World). You'll want to use the shuttles as you are far from Disney and super far from Universal and Sea World. Taxis are outrageous and not worth it. 2. You get lots of space in each suite. We found plenty of room with staying with our friend and never felt cramped. 3. You get a fridge to store food in. This is a bonus if you want to keep dairy products or snacks. There is a Publix across the street and it is easily accessible. Can end up saving a lot by using the kitchen. Note: You have to pay for any pots/ pans/ silverware. What we ended up doing was, taking extra plastics when we were eating out in Disney. Just grab a bunch of forks and spoons- SO MUCH CHEAPER!!!! 4. No extra fees like some other reviews had written of. I checked with the guy upon leaving and was like, \"So nothing extra is going to show up on my VISA now like some other people have warned!?!?\". He said no, but he also added, \"I hope not!\" So, take it for what it was. Thus far, no extra charges! :) Some of the minor inconveniences: 1. Television remotes did not work. This is minor so we did not really care. We rarely watched any television on our trip and it was a bit annoying that anytime we wanted to change the volume/ channel, we had to get up and do so. A reminder to be thankful for modern conveniences back home eh!?!? :) 2. The water pressure is terrible. I think they have gone more green to make it efficient. It's just hard to enjoy the medium heated shower when it has such weak pressure. Not a big deal for us though. 3. The shuttle times and drivers are to be desired. I think they don't like their jobs so they are somewhat short with people and indirect. We had two of them tell us that they didn't drive to Celebration at Old Town and we had been taking the shuttle with them for three or four days. After telling them exactly where we were staying, the one guy was like, \"Oh yeah, I go there!!!\" Of course you do- we knew you did!!!! Plus, the times are like 6 pm, or 10 pm and anytime you go, it'll be super busy and the bus will be packed! So, just hope you can get on quickly and sit down. Too bad they did not have an 8pm pickup time in there to break it up. Also, the earliest time you can go is 10 am and it takes at least 20 minutes to get there. It'd be nice if they had another early pickup time. Thankfully they make three trips in the morning as well. We got what we paid for and were pleased with it. We didn't pay a lot and we did not have high expectations. It's great and cheap if you are traveling on the cheap side. If you are not looking for cheap, this may not be right for you.

The rooms online looked spectacular (room 1229 - don't know the building) and clean and modern. And the rate for what we saw was wonderful, so we all decided to book, looking forward to our trip. When we checked in, we got the shock of our lives. It was nothing like what we'd seen online. The carpet in my room (J-1325) had burn holes in them, the televisions didn't work properly and the bar right outside my back door was a nice touch. Especially the loud bass music that played until 2am. And the fact that my front door didn't close properly was a nice feature too. I would NEVER stay here again, this was not the perfect hotel I had imagined it to be. You would do better to camp out in your car or stay at the local truck stop motel. The matress in the main room was covered in stains...GROSS!! The next room (J-1327) where my parents stayed had a terrible odor that smelled like a cross between dirty feet and bleach! The room number was missing and replaced with masking tape and the room number was written in pencil. The refrigerator had no bar on the door to store food and the stove was disgusting! All of the fixtures in the bathroom were black. The TV in the bedroom didn't work at all either. In room N-1400, where my sister and her family stayed, white paint was covering mold on the ceiling near the kitchen, the wall paper was coming off the walls, and their son's room smelled of must! We had no kitchen utensils (plates, cups, silverware, etc..) so we had to rent them for $5 a day. The bathroom towels were small and as thin as paper. They brought an air purifier with them that they just purchased. After 2 nights of staying here, the filter is now full of dirt and dust!!! We're writing all this because you should now that this is not an isolated incident.. This is a family that stayed in 3 separate rooms in 2 different buildings!! Please do not stay here.. The people are rude and unaccomodating and the place is absolutely unsanitary!! When we first pulled up near building N, the trash was overflowing. We immediately began calling around to other hotels and could not find 3 rooms available. NEVER AGAIN!!! STAY AWAY!!! I am contacting the department of Health and the Better Business Bureau.

It's now called Celebration Suites at Old Town and it's in Kissimmee. After reading the reviews I wasn't expecting much and really just wanted some space with a separate sleeping area. It was for me, my husband and and a 10 year old grandson. We were being cheap because we were spending a lot of money at Disney and didn't want to spend a lot more for lodging since we would only be sleeping there. That was a mistake. The rooms are very old, and to be honest, they have done the best they could with such old rooms. The lobby is being \"remodeled\" and it smelled really musty and bad. I felt sorry for the employees. The employees were nice and doing the best they could, but this is not the nicest area of town and the room was just plain creepy. It felt dirty and grungy, even though it wasn't really dirty, just old and run down. The carpet was worn and so soiled I couldn't walk on it without shoes. One bed only had a half sheet on the bottom. The furniture was decrepit and just disgusting. I felt dirty just standing in the room. When I went to the lobby the internet was down and the only people in there were all complaining about their rooms. I agree that it is a bargain for the size and price, but I didn't feel safe and I couldn't wait to leave. I didn't complain because it is what it is, and should have been torn down a long time ago.
