Joelle who works at the front doors was among my favourites, he actually remembered us from when we visited in JUNE !!! He must see a thousand people a day ! He wold say things like \" do you need a cab mister Rocky ?\" or \" Hello Miss Genny, how was your day\" when we would return to the hotel. Andre at the front desk is again, a favourite of mine, he recommended the wings at Timothy O'Tooles last visit and was again as friendly this visit, he even went to the back to get us an umbrella before we went out one rainy evening ! There was another gentleman working the front door this time and I failed to get his name , but he was also SO friendly, high fiving us and getting really excited when we returned from the Bulls game. It is unheard of, in my opinion, for employees of a hotel to be SO personable !! Annie was also at the hotel again this time, working nights, so we got to see her both night, same sweet and friendly Annie !!

Bed was very comfortable and pillow menu is a nice touch. A couple of things that were slightly disappointing: 1) water pressure was poor due to the fact you had to turn almost all the way to hot to get a warm shower 2) the exercise room, while nice, only had one fully functional treadmill (among the three in the room). The comfort, location and amenities were well worth the price paid (Travelzoo special). Overall I would recommend the property with the caveat that you can book for less than $200/night.

My mother was visiting me in the U.S., and we have decided to spend a few nights in Chicago. We really like Elysian, but wanted to be low-budget this time, so I chose junior-suite at Affinia. Overall my impression is that the hotel had a potential of being a cool quality hotel, but lack of professionalism in their service made us determine not going back. I have received much better service at 2-star hotel or even at B&B. The property is relatively well-kept. Yes, this is not a 5-star hotel, so the furniture in the room is on a cheaper side (the bed is comfortable). But the service was 1 star. If I could, I prefer 0 star. The front desk staff greeted us friendly, but the lady who took care of us was just irresponsible. Yes, they could handle the reservation but nothing more than that - just like some of the reviewers have mentioned. One of the front desk staff suggested dinner cruise, and we were thrilled about the suggestion, and we asked her to make the rservation. She promised me that she would leave a voicemail. Nothing happened. I called the front desk, no note. I went to the front desk next morning, they had no idea. I came back to the hotel (just to find her) in the afternoon, and all she told me was just to go to Navy Pier. I didn't imagine that I had to ask her to give me more details. That was just unprofessional. And yes, no word of apology. The lack of professionalism did not end here. We have decided to go to C-House. The food was not superb, but it was okay. Having eaten food in other countries, we felt that Marcus' food was just overrated. What really surprised us was the unprofessional server. His job was minimum, and he did not come back to the table (even for the check) until we had to call the manager of the restaurant. We thought that the hotel should know about it, and sent an email. The response was just a quick email saying that they will let the GM know. I seriously wondered how come these people are working in the service industry. It is natural to have these mis-haps in the hotels, I think. At the same time, the way the hotel responds to mis-haps will change the customer's perception of the hotel 180 degrees. Just a card with a few pieces of candy would have made us enjoy this property. Yet, this did not happen at this hotel.

Although the bathroom was small, it was functional. No problems with noise or anything. Overall a fantastic boutique hotel! Also, I have a few MUST HAVE food recommendations: 1) enjoy breakfast at YOLK, a diner about 5 minute cab ride from Affinia. We really enjoyed bacon stuffed waffles, as well as the banana nut french toast. Most folks say be prepared for a wait, but we were lucky and had no wait. 2) GARRETTS POPCORN! Enjoy the Chicago Mix of cheese & caramel. The line looks long, but don't be intimidated...it's worth the effort to taste fresh made popcorn...I grew up on this stuff and DELICIOUS is all I can say. There's a location about two blocks away from Affinia. 3) CHICAGO STYLE HOTDOG: Yummy! You can get one on the street or go to \"Foodlife\" in the Water Tower to grab a Chicago Hotdog. 4) GIORDANO'S: Deep Dish Stuffed Pizza. My personal favorite is sausage with onions & peppers. It takes about 35-40 minutes for the pizza to cook so don't be in too much of a rush when you go there.

I book a studio suite because I love the feeling of staying in an apartment verses a standard hotel room. In the studio suite you get a queen size bed, a large dresser, a huge LCD TV, a sitting area with sofa, coffee table and great reclining chair, an elevated 'office' area with huge desk, and a standard hotel refrigerator with an assortment of pricey goodies and an extra shelf to put your own cans of soda and snacks. The bathroom is a bit smallish and the power outlet was placed in such a way as to force you to stand sandwiched between the vanity and the toilet to use the hair dryer but that was really the only inconvenience. I loved having a tub! My main complaint with every Affinia I've stayed in (NYC and Chicago) is the lack of good lighting in the sitting area. There was only one table lamp and no overhead light. Another complaint, as other reviewers have mentioned; WiFi costs $9.99 for a 24-hour block. Just as a contrast, a hotel we booked during the summer (Affinia was booked solid that weekend) that you can see from the Affinia had a complimentary MAC computer in the room with free WiFi!!! I travel a great deal all over the world and have rarely stayed in a hotel, city or otherwise, that has charged me for WiFi in the recent past. So Affinia, if you're reading this; FREE WIFI would be an awesome plus for your guests! When I arrived for my three-night stay, the temperature in my room read 67 degrees even though someone had set the thermostat at 80. I turned the thermostat up and the temperature went down to 65. I called the front desk and Peter gave me a trick to try and said to give it some time and if things didn't warm up, I should give him a call back. Half an hour later, the temperature had dropped to 64. I was just reaching for the phone when Peter called me back, chiding me for waiting so long while I was slowly freezing to death in my room. He immediately sent up someone from maintenance, and soon I was basking in warmth. The fan cycles on and off if you have it on the auto setting. One reviewer said this kept him awake but if you set the fan to \"On\" vs. \"Auto\", the fan will blow continuously which keeps the room at a more even temperature too. Also, the windows do not provide a great deal of insulation and since I was at the Affinia during an Arctic blast, the only way to maintain warmth throughout the room was to keep the curtains pulled down which blocked the view but left the room really cozy. My husband and I enjoyed a drink in the C-View Lounge which at this time of year is a quiet and relaxing spot to unwind. If you are staying around the time of this review, try the Pumpkin Pie - vodka with pureed pumpkin and Frangelica whipped cream. It is amazing!!!

We were going to the Chicago Shakespeare theater and I looked for hotels near Navy Pier. Though it's the official hotel of NP, it's not the closest hotel. I had tried for a room at the Sheraton (booked) and thought about the W, but this was only a bit away from there, so I thought we might be able to walk there. On a less windy, warmer evening, I think it would have been ok, but we ended up taking a cab each way. So don't stay here if you want to walk to Navy Pier, at least unless it's warm enough and you want to do the walk. However, for a nice hotel right next to the water tower and Michigan Ave, it was a very good quality stay. My brother and his wife had a king size bed, get robes and slippers. I had a queen and a sitting area, but no robe and slippers. Still it was very clean, looked pretty new, very comfortable bed, good quality toiletries, in room coffee pot and in room minibar well stocked. Wifi is not free, I didn't end up using it. The hotel is essentially next door to Northwestern med school's hospital and the windows do NOT mask the noise, so being Friday night, there were many ambulances driving by. Even on the 25th floor, that was very loud (but being really tired, I slept well). My brother was on the other side, it didn't seem to bother them as much. Workout room is not so easy to find, no signs on the floor where it is, but it's pretty nice with all the equipment kept up and about 3 of each kind of equipment piece, so plenty for everyone, as well as weight machines and free weights. The bar is quite small and even though it's on the roof, not too much of a view though in the summer when their terrace is open, it's probably pretty nice and much bigger. Plenty of choices in terms of drinks as it is fully stocked and the bar staff was very nice. The restaurant attached is a Marcus Samuelsson restaurant, and we only had breakfast there but it was quite good. Wanted to try dinner, as he's definitely a well-known and respected chef, so I'd guess it is really good. Gino's East pizzeria is right next door too. Having grown up and gone to medical school in Chicago, I can tell you Gino's pizza is worth the wait! All in all, this was a pretty nice location and I'd come back. Yes the parking is expensive but you can self park around the corner for a lot less. I'd just suggest if you stay here ask for a room away from the hospital side.

I found the people in Chicago to be very friendly and good humoured, so the staff's attitude stood out a bit. Location is excellent, right across the Mag Mile. Gino's East is next door and there's a nice place for breakfast called Corner Bakery nearby. There's only one issue, and a major one, that I feel Affinia has to change: its wi-fi. Before we got to Chicago, we traveled the West Coast and stayed in quite a few hotels, most of them nowhere near the quality of Affinia, and they all offered wi-fi in the rate. All of them, including the ones that were basically motels. At the Affinia Chicago, you have to pay an extra US$ 9.99 per day per device, meaning you have to pay double if you and your wife want to access the internet on each others smartphones/laptops. On top of that, the wi-fi connection is an AT&T service, so you have to input your credit card information in an website instead of the hotel including this in their bill.

However, upon further examination I realized that there was no microwave and I had to unload the alcohol from the fridge so I could put in a couple cans of pop. There was no fan in the bathroom, water spots and cracks on the ceiling, and the bathtub tile needed re-grouted. When I bathed I found a yellow spot on my towel. The coffee maker makes coffee, but has no way to keep it warm and as I mentioned before, there's no microwave. The continental breakfast for two is $24 more AND Internet is an additional $10. The final problem I found with the room was when I found the heating/air conditioning unit the filter was completely clogged. Luckily I'm not sensitive to dust.

I was very excited and sent an email to the hotel asking about family packages, car rental places, suggestions for a family vacation etc. No answer for 4 months despite forwarding my email to the same and several different addresses. I finally looked up the address of the hotel manager who replied promptly, apologising and promising tickets to Navy Pier for our family. Next I read on tripadvisor about something called e-upgrade and again sent an email inquiry. This time the reply came only a few days later, informing us that an upgrade to a studio suite was possible at 40usd/ night. Booked that as had read so many good things about the suites on tripadvisor and asked for a quiet room with a view. All this was delivered. After a nine hour long flight (and another 2 hours spent in airport immigration line) the 30-minute cab drive ( at about 40 usd) was a breeze. Our room was ready for us and it really was just as big and comfortable as everyone had said. At check-in we were also straight away given tickets to the attractions and the children's museum at Navy Pier, just as the manager had promised. In order not to wake up jetlagged and hungry, we ordered a large deep dish pizza from Gino's (very easy, we walked in past the line, ordered the pizza and picked it up 45-50 min later). This did the trick and when we woke up at 2 am we were only jetlagged, not hungry :-). It was then that we really appreciated the size of the room! That morning we wanted to try out Lou Mitchell's breakfast place I had seen someone mention here (a tip for other suffering from jetlag, it opens at 5.30 except on SUN at 7 am). With children, however, it was definitely more than a 20-minute walk, (I would say closer to 40), but definitely worth it for the experience!) On the other days we went to the corner bakery which you can almost see when you come out of the hotel. It was very very good with children and also offers great lunch and dinner. Many people suggested Walgreens for snacks and drinks, but if you are like us travelling with children you might like to check out Dominick's (very close on 255 east grand avenue) for an impressive selection and lower prices. Make sure you ask for the courtesy card at the cashier, it really saves a lot of money (that can then be used for other shopping, the Disney store is just around the corner - so is the Hershey signature store which is a must visit with kids!) The hotel staff was nice and polite, but perhaps a bit detached. The only thing about the room was that there was a noticeable layer of dust in the bathroom, which was surprising as it seemed so well kept otherwise. So, yes, not perfect but close to it. We would definitely stay there another time too. A few general tips for families, especially the ones that travel from overseas or anywhere where there is a time difference issue...we had planned quite a program for our days in Chicago, but noticed that we didn't do half of it because of jetlag. The children loved Navy Pier and the ferris Wheel was definitely worth it. The children's museum had something both our 5-year-old and our 10-year-old enjoyed (us parents enjoyed Garrett's pop corn most of all). The Bean and Millenium park were fun and we got great pictures by it.

If you eat next door at Geno's pizza, allow for 45 min for the pizza to be made, and a long line.

I have stayed at a variety of places around CHI town over the years both as a tourist and on business, but the Affinia has become my favorite. Once in the lobby, we relaxed, after the frazzled drive in from Ann Arbor, MI. Check-in was a breeze, and within minutes, we were in our modern, clean, zen-like, suite.

I have also stayed at this hotel alone, and whether you are in a standard room, or in a larger suite, the bathroom has plenty of space and is well-organized to accommodate your things. Part of the amenities are nice Philosophy products. If you've forgotten something though, they can get it for you. The bedding and pillows (choose from the pillow menu) are super comfortable, fresh and hypoallergenic, and each room has a sitting area, with comfy chairs or a sofa. What's so nice about this hotel is that it's peaceful, central, yet just a skip off the main fray of MI avenue, still accessible to everything on foot--the lake, Miracle Mile shopping, and my favorite, the Museum of Contemporary Art, just around the corner. Every Tuesday in front of the museum from late Spring to Fall is a lovely Farmer's Market, full of flowers, fresh produce, and plenty of grab-and-go cuisine. Although never a lack of things to do in this city, I recommend the jazz concerts at aforementioned museum. Schedule can be found online, or just ask the concierge. The concierge at the Affinia, is extremely helpful and the staff make you truly feel like welcomed guests, so if you need anything from directions, maps, an extra pillow or spa service, don't be afraid to ask. It's very common to see guests coming in the front door with bags and packages from afternoon-long shopping sprees along Michigan Avenue, If you need help navigating to your room with packages, the bell hop is on it. You are within blocks of some wonderful restaurants, and hoppin' Gino's East Pizza is next door, but I also recommend the C-view restaurant right at the Affinia-- wonderful fresh and beautifully presented cuisine.

We were pleased with the rate we obtained from Hotels.com and looked forward to our stay. The Affinia looks like it was an older/building or hotel that has been recently renovated. The lobby is spacious and modern in appearance. Although we arrived early, we able to check in early, a convenience that is much appreciated when traveling with a small child. Unfortunately, the amenities I had called ahead to request, were not ready for us. It did take several calls to the front desk for these items to be delivered.

The location is great, just off the Magnificent Mile. You're within walking distance to shops, restaurants and many downtown tourist sites. The Affinia also has a weekend shuttle that runs directly to the Navy Pier for those who are interested. We did have a few negatives during our stay. The noise from the adjacent hospital/ambulances can be quite annoying throughout the evening. My wife is a light sleeper and she had difficulty falling asleep. Additionally, the walls do not insulate noise well. We did have several nights where other guests were returning to their rooms rather late at night. Their conversation was clearly heard and did wake us up on these occasions. WiFi is also an additional charge. As most hotels in the US often offer it for free, we were a little annoyed at this inconvenience. Lastly, we did have the concierge make dinner reservations for us at a local restaurant. Unfortunately, they made they for the week after the day we wanted! We did not discover this until we arrived at the restaurant. Despite the negatives outlined above, we were quite pleased with our stay at the the Affinia. We will likely consider this hotel again for future stays in Chicago.

As a Starwood Preferred member I was originally thinking about one of those facilities (Sheraton or the W) and was in active negotiations for a deal until Travelzoo\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s weekly Top 20 deals hit my inbox and Affina was the feature hotel that fit our dates. This trip was used to help reveal her real gift \u00e2\u20ac\u201c a 20 day trip to Thailand we will take in a few months. As always, I wanted to know what I was getting myself into before I decided on this hotel over the W and turned to trusty positive Tripadvisor reviews before locking into the deal and found it was a very well run facility. Through other reviews I was able to find the GM\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s email (Claudia Eggspuhler) on one of her responses and reached out to her personally to ensure we were going to have the perfect weekend for this monumental occasion. The hotel sends out a 5 day confirmation letter complete with weather forecast for you stay map and the ability to enhance your stay with various in room purchase. I opted for rose petals ($25) and small cupcake dessert ($9) delivered to the room while we would be out for the celebratory 40th birthday meal as just one more nice surprise for my wife. Not only was it perfect and the concierge nailed it as the pictures shows but it also was on the house and not part of my final bill which as great of Affina. Thanks again. We ended up getting a 1 bedroom studio suite with a queen bed and it was very spacious. Our rate including tax for 2 nights was only $229 and later when I found out it also happened to be the weekend Chicago celebrates St Pat\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Day (Sat the 12th this yr) I thought it was an exception value. Affina will run a lot of deals it seems but you could easily pay about $700+ for a 2 night stay most weekends in the same level of accommodations. The other couple just had the basic room which was still roomy for big city standards but lacked a separate living room and desk area and our rate for that deal was only $10/night more. The hotel is right next to the famous Gino\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s East deep dish pizza joint where we would have dinner the first night of our stay (separate review). Upon arrival the staff was great to great us and had recognized the occasion and wished by wife a happy birthday and made some great dinner suggestions for us during our stay. The elevators up to the room were small and slow but that was my only knock on this place. When you first enter the studio suite you will find an executive desk and then you step down into your living room and adjoining open bedroom area. Loved the swivel flat screen TV that you could watch from either the living room or bedroom area. There was a very large dorm room fridge area but no microwave in the room for use. It is a very urban chic decorative feel to it. One of the coolest options for our stay was the personal selection of pillows (6 of them) that you could try each night during your stay. My wife selected the Swedish memory foam but I tried the buckwheat and thought I wouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t like it but it was so good that on the 2nd night she switched and got one to. The other couple picked up the sound pillow and plugged in their ipod\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s and raved about them as well. We were out on the town for most of our stay but we did go up to the C-view which I guess is highly rated roof top bar. It was a small lounge with a great city view. A bit stuffy for my liking more so from the clientele whom seemed to be more upscale and dressed up in evening gowns compared to our smart causal attire for a relaxing weekend. Drinks were pretty strong but expensive so we stayed for only a few and moved on to a local bar for the rest of the evening. Room Tip: I always ask for a very quiet room far away from elevators, stairs, maid closets and ice machines on a higher floor. Claudia ensured that is what we got. Overall \u00e2\u20ac\u201c Had a great stay, no issues with anything and a very nice level of service is this boutique feel of a hotel.

Unfortunately we were quite disappointed with the hotel. The rooms are small, dull, and the hotel staff aren't especially helpful. We had a roll-away bed in our room which was a suite (we had originally booked a room with two double beds and we had planned to place a roll-away bed there but when we go to the front desk they said that there was a fire hazard and this was illegal so we had to upgrade to a suite), and it was quite cramped and the air conditioning was very noisy. We didn't get the chance to eat in the hotel restaurant, but from what we saw the food did look nice but overpriced. Although this has nothing to do with the hotel, one word of warning: Get dinner at around 5pm, because the custom in Chicago is to queue up outside a restaurant for around 45 mins until a table becomes available. We found this custom highly irritating, and on our first night we ended up not eating until around 11pm- this didn't go down well! Another option is to make a reservation for a table. Some of the restaurants we ate in included Gino's East Pizzeria (nice enough food, after 5pm the lines outside start to build up however so get there early), and a restaurant just up the road that served Mexican food ( we booked a table the night before). If you are looking for places to eat breakfast, definitely go to Lou Mitchell's, they are really friendly and the food is brilliant. It's about a 20 minute walk away though. Einstein Bagels also do a very reasonably priced breakfast- a bagel and a coffee is around 4 dollars. Overall, we were quite disappointed with the Affinia, we expected better quality of service and nicer rooms. The rooms are well equipped however- hairdryer, iron, ironing board etc. Oh, and one other piece of advice: use public transport as much as possible in Chicago!

We go to Chicago every summer for a little romantic vacation and this hotel has the best location we have ever stayed at! We had a jr suite which was very nice the room had a great view and it was nice to be able to move around and not be cramped in a small room. The housecleaning staff were amazing, every day the room was cleaned as if it was our first day and they were always super nice and helpful when asked questions or they would great us ever morning with a smile and hello. They did move us up from the 8th floor to a much higher up room for a better view with no questions or trouble. That is where the good ends. The Bad - The hotel is across the street from a major hospital so the sirens are pretty loud and if you are a light sleeper I suggest that you bring ear plugs or a small sound machine. If you aren't use to city noises I would suggest that you request as high a room as you can get. The room comes with a stocked mini fridge that was never cool and in our first warm was actually blowing out hot air. Staff beyond the housekeepers and the room service delivery people could have cared less if we were there or not. The Ugly - We noticed on day one that if you did not look like you had money or that you didn't have your car valet parked you would be ignored by just about everyone. I asked other guests if they were treated the same way and yes they were, so it wasn't just us. No one ever offered to get us a cab in our 5 days we were there. One morning I went out and it was pouring down rain and not even then did they offer to get me a cab, but another person came out dressed a little nicer and the bellmen were falling all over themselves to get that person a cab. Then it got really ugly on our last day. I wore a University of Notre Dame t-shirt and one of the bellmen asked me about my shirt, and once they found out that my fianc\u00c3\u00a9 is currently attending the University of Notre Dame to obtain her PhD, the bellmen started falling all over themselves to serve us MUCH better. It was amazing!

Although quite busy with visitors, the check in staff under the expert guidance of a professional looking young manager named Steve, was friendly, professional, and extremely helpful in answering questions about our hotel needs, restaurants and places to see during our short stay. We had a choice of pillows for our bed. When we opened the door to our room, it was a Wow factor.There was the sound of waterfall and birds playing in our room. The king bed was incredible, a great modern headboard and a mattress that was amazing. There was a flat screen TV which swiveled from the bed area over to the sofa in the sitting area. It provided a lot of stations along with movies, kids programming, gaming, and digital radio. The room was modern and comfy. Liked that there was a dressing table area outside of bathroom. Everything was sparkling clean which I really liked. When I made a call to housekeeping to open/prepare the extra sofabed, they came in less than 10 minutes.

Upon arrival our room had not been cleaned from the previous guest, so the lady at the front desk had housekeeping put a \"rush\" on the room and offered to store our bags (for free) so we could go explore the city. She then proceeded to ask us what our plans were. Being famished from a long day of travel, we told her we were headed out for a famous deep dish pizza from Gino's next door. She (I don't remember her name) then handed us a coupon to use at Gino and said, \"Use this to skip the line.\" This came in very handy, because the line was an hour long! We skipped the line, were seated immediately and enjoyed a delicious pizza and free bread sticks (via the coupon) and a few beers. Before we were even finished eating, the front desk called us to say that our room was ready. So we finished eating, grabbed our bags, and went up to the room. The room was amazing and huge (2 king beds). Even with 2 king beds there was a sitting area and a desk. The bathroom was gorgeous. The floors, shower and sink were all marble and very clean. That night we enjoyed a wonderful night's sleep in very comfortable beds. The next morning we used the in room coffee maker, but did not have enough mugs or coffee for everyone in the room. We called the front desk and within 5 minutes more mugs and coffee packets were brought up. Now that's service! We headed out for the day and passed the maid in hallway who greeted us with a friendly nod. When we returned for the night we found our room as neat and tidy as it had been the day before. All in all this hotel is great. We didn't stay long, but we enjoyed our stay greatly. The Affinia has awesome roof top bar and and restaurant off the lobby.

I cannot BEGIN to tell you what a wonderful experience we had, JUST IN THE HOTEL ! This hotel treats it's guests as if you are at a 5 star resort in Mexico ! I've never met friendlier staff or more accomodating staff ! Specifically Annie, Damien and Andre were my favourites among every other staff member employed there ! Everytime my boyfriend and I returned to the hotel from our MANY chicago adventures, they would ask \" how was the double decker? Did you find that store you were looking for \" \" what did you buy today \" \" what are you doing tonight ? \" It was like coming home to a bunch of really friendly and nice roommates ! The rooms themselves and the entire hotel are breathtaking. HUGE rooms ( we stayed in a studio suite 1 ) and it was amazing ! Clean, Fresh, Modern, Comfortable !! OUr room was 1001 and it was right beside the elevator, I did not hear that elevator even ONCE, we slept like babies the entire night ! The Restaurant staff is also extremely friendly and they remembered us each time, using specifics from an earlier visit as conversation starters ! The best part ? THE FOOD IS FANTASTIC !!! I recommend the Almond French Toast for breakfast ! I had not even ONE issue with this hotel, I loved every part of it, and every minute of it . I plan to go back to Chicago in the very near future, and will absolutely be staying at The Affinia. The location is prime, parking is a breeze, and there are several restaurants near by ! Mag Mile is a one minute walk to the end of the block !! One of the staff who works at the Affinia, ( I wish I knew his name ) recommended Timothy O'Toole's Pub for a late night snack on a Tuesday ( 11:30 pm ) for hot wings ...and I'll tell you, those wings were the best I'd ever had ! I know that there are many hotel choices in Chicago, but I can assure you as someone who travels frequently, if it weren't for the staff at this hotel, I don't know if our trip would have been as enjoyable ! They really gave Chicago a great name, and The Manager ( who I also met, very friendly and happy gentleman ) should be very proud of the staff he's chosen ! Have a great time in Chicago, and I strongly recommend you make your trip worthwhile and choose the Affinia !", "Date": "June 12, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Macclesfield, Cheshire", "Title": "\u201cGood hotel, shame about the breakfast.\u201d", "Author": "apollo12", "ReviewID": "UR112941418", "Content": "Arrived feeling verry dishevelled after a delayed rail journey to be greated by very friendly & welcoming staff who ran through the hotel ammenities on arrival.

Plenty of TV chanels to browse through & air con that worked well. Windows could have been better soundproofed as we were woken quite early by delivery vans outside. The mini bar is overpriced but there is a Walgreens about a 5-10 min walk away which is a lot cheaper. Used the restaurant the following morning for breakfast & regretted it as the sausage patties contained so much chilli that i was ill within 15 mins of getting to my room. Did not bother to complain to the restaurant but would have like to have been told beforehand in order to choose a differnt breakfast item. The following day we found a great bakery less than 2 blocks away which suited us a lot better. Staff gave us the wrong information on getting to a museum & suggested we take a cab. Thankfully we had been given some information from another website which got us there for a fraction of the cost. They were very helpful in providing maps & allowing us to store our bags after checkout. The location is great for exploring the Magnificent mile & it's a short walk to the subway staions, Navy Pier & the John Hancock building.

Checking in was straightforward and we soon found our way to the 25th floor on the express lift with a view of the John Hancock building from our room. The rooms are very spacious with a range of pillows, large bed and blinds to shut all day light out. The bathroom was clean and you had the option of having a bath here as well as a shower. Coffee facilities were also provided but unfortunately there are no tea facilities. I would recommend that all tea drinkers should bring their own supply of tea when coming to the states as it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not in abundance here and is expensive. If bringing your own travel kettle, be aware of the difference in voltage here. The American system runs on 110 volts unlike the English 240 volts so an additional adaptor is needed. There was also a large TV in the room at the end of a very comfortable bed. One thing I found slightly annoying (especially after staying at many hotels and motels across the country) was being asked to pay for Wi-Fi. We didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t take this option up and had stayed at better and cheaper places where this was free. You should bear this in mind if you have a smart phone or use a laptop. The location of the hotel is also pretty good, quite central to everything. There is also a very popular pizza restaurant next door (Gino\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s East). So popular in fact that people queue up outside to eat there. We spoke to the helpful person at the reception of the hotel who gave us a \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcguest pass\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 to jump the queue (well, it was raining and cold that night). Once in you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be dealt with quite quickly, just bear in mind that the meals here are very large. We were advised against ordering what we ordered on account of the amount of food that would be coming. Suffice to say we left very full indeed (and had to leave some). Across the road from the front of the hotel is a \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcpub\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 called the Elephant and Castle. This is very similar to a Wetherspoons pub not only in the choice of beer it sells but also the sort of food. Not brilliant but does the job if hungry and you don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t fancy going to a restaurant. There is also a bar on the top floor of the hotel which we visited, but on reflection I would say you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re better off going to the Signature Bar of the John Hancock building rather than this. There was hardly anyone there the night we went and the views were nothing special (and the drinks were pricey). In the John Hancock on the other hand, the drinks are still pricey, but the bar is very lively and the views much, much better (and it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s only a 5 minute walk away).

NO...by the time you ended up tipping all the people with thier hands out it was at least another $15-$20 (driver, guy that takes your bags out, etc) Try the pizza place next door if you want some authentic Chicago deep dish pizza!

Let's start off with all the positives: + Great location. Half a block of Michigan Ave and adjacent to Gino's East. + Always friendly front door staff. + Pleasant and professional front desk staff. + Rooms are clean and bedding is nice with no gross comforter on the beds. + Taller folks will like that the shower heads on their tubs are probably placed at about 6' 4\". My wife couldn't reach the shower head to adjust it. + Large windows that can open a little to let some air in. + The room size compares favorably to some of the NYC hotels that I've used. + The hotel location is a bit far from the subway station, but very convenient for buses. Chicago parking rates are insanely high, so public transit and taxi are the way to go when visiting. + Calls to the front desk were answered promptly and courteously and our requests for items were promptly delivered. + The pillow menu is a nice feature. Now the not so good: - As previously mentioned in other posts, the air conditioning/heating system is loud. Not a constant flow unit, but turns on and off as the room temperature changes. We had to turn off the a/c because the noise affected out sleep. - Housekeeping had one bad day when they forgot to replace out tissue box and left behind a pillowcase and dust rag in the room. No other housekeeping issues except for that one day. - I had thought that the neighbors were allowing their doors to slam behind them, but I later realized that the door locking mechanism is just really loud. The doors auto-deadbolt when you close the door and while it gives you added safety, it makes a loud \"clack\" no matter how gently you close the door. - Windows are old and allowed a lot of cold air to penetrate. There is a big temperature difference near the windows when the shades are open. - Only two elevators so it might get busy during checkout. - Neither of us cared for the bathroom products. We didn't like the olive oil soap and the shampoo that was provided. - No business center to print out your boarding pass, although the front desk was nice enough to let me use their computer for this purpose. While this is over-the-top nice, it just feels awkward. - In this day and age, charging $10 for wifi seems a bit chintzy. I'm a little torn. If I could get a similar rate in the future, I would have no problem in recommending the Affinia, but if I had to pay anywhere near the normal rate, I would have second thoughts.

The pros: the location is good -- right off Michigan Avenue and near the Lake; the place was reasonably priced $150 a night; the room service breakfast was great (fresh and hot and timely); it's relatively clean. These are all good things and make this a solid hotel. But, the Cons: the elevators are soooo slow. you have to add 6-7 minutes to your commute time both coming and going. this was a problem last time which I attributed to the rooftop bar, but this time the bar was closed and it was just as bad. it rained most of my trip and upon one excursion out, I asked the valet if they had umbrellas. He pointed me to the front desk. As I walked inside, the bell captain asked what I needed. I said an umbrella (one of which he had in his hand). He told me they were located in the mini bar. I said, don't you have any to borrow? He said, no, they cost $10 in the mini bar. I said, the guy outside said you had some at the front desk (and I pointed out the valet). The bell captain said he's just the valet, I'm the bell captain and we don't have umbrellas. I left into the rain. I've stayed at hotels all over the world. Every luxury hotel has umbrellas that you may borrow if it's raining. This irked me. Also, the front desk friendliness is very inconsistent. The lady that checked me in didn't say welcome back or ask me if I had any questions about the hotel or anything. She just asked for my credit card and gave me a room key. Meanwhile, the guy checking in the guest right next to me asked the guy if he had questions, pointed out the gym, talked about the restaurant, etc. Finally, the noise from the street is a real issue. I pointed this out last time too. This time I was on a higher floor --17, and could still hear the ambulances (the hotel is right across from NW hospital). So in the end, I'm not sure. Definitely won't stay if it's supposed to rain. For the money, it was a good deal but I was there for a conference.

Our room, with two double beds, was very large and divided into two semi-levels. The bathroom and bar area were on a landing at main-door level and the beds were three steps down in sort of a sunken-living-room set-up. The beds and linens were clean and we had more pillows than anyone would ever want or need, though the down comforters were a teensy bit worn and discoloured. The bathroom was roomy and spotless, with ample towels, but there wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t much counter space, so we used the desk outside its door as a place on which to keep our toiletries. The flat-screen TV in the room was wall-mounted and swiveled, which was handy, though we did notice that it occasionally lost reception quality if turned in one particular direction (likely due to a loose cable connection somewhere). The leather recliner was very comfortable and clean, and a nice touch. We had a great view south along St. Clair, and found the room to be fairly quiet. We did hear other guests in the hallway outside, as well as ambulance sirens occasionally, but never loud enough or long enough to cause excessive disruption. As other reviewers have noted, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a bit of a shame that many basic amenities (e.g., local phone calls, internet) come with an additional charge. We were also disappointed that we were unable to use the mini-fridge in our room \u00e2\u20ac\u201c it was stocked full with beverages and, when we asked if it might be emptied so we could use it for our own snacks, we were told it *could* be emptied out... for a $50 fee. That seemed a smidge exorbitant, so we just moved things aside a little and had room to keep the occasional yogurt or bottle of water inside overnight. (We always ate or removed our own items in the morning, lest they be taken out by the mini-bar inventory-control clerks.) We found the staff to be consistently friendly and accommodating \u00e2\u20ac\u201c we were always greeted with a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153good morning\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd or \u00e2\u20ac\u0153hello\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd if we passed anyone coming or going from the hotel \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and any questions we had were always answered happily. We smelled cigarette smoke out in the hallway one evening (the entire hotel is non-smoking) and were pleasantly surprised at how thankful the guest services staffer was when we called down to let her know. We also used the complimentary (we were sure there would be a fee, but there wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t!) service whereby guests can print out boarding passes before heading to the airport. We found it efficient, and the young woman at the front desk (I forgot to get her name) who assisted me was extremely helpful and patient despite the extended seat-selection process and printer snafus.

It was so simple & easy, I was beyond surprised. And immediately we felt like we were greeted by a family member. Upon Check-In we were greeted by the staff at the front desk & it was the most effortless check in. The travel agency I had used in booking the hotel had not specified I needed a room with 2 beds, but that was no problem at all. They even tried to accommodate one of my more difficult travel companions in sticking us on the 8th floor (he's a bit superstitious). We were advised the 8th floor had window obstruction so with a little gentle persuasion my friend agreed to the 6th floor. The rooms are extremely spacious and comfortable. The round mirror in the bathroom may have been the best mirror in the world. Let's just say, you can't look bad, ever. Within the first night at the Affinia we were addressed by the staff every time we walked through the lobby. We even invited some of them for a drink (they all declined). That's how inviting and warm these people were. I'm not one to really praise hotel staff, but this stay was far beyond exceptional. They booked a ghost tour for us, suggested restaurants & bars, just went above and beyond what was necessary & I can't express how appreciative I am of that. The location is right off of Magnificent Mile. You take a few steps & you're in the center of a wonderful shopping district. Restaurants & other evening destinations are within walking distance. By the 3rd night of our stay, we were ready to make the Affinia our permanent residence. Unfortunately, reality sunk in & we had to leave. Though it was difficult to part with what may have been the best weekend ever, I know for a fact that if I ever go back to Chicago, the Affinia is my #1 hotel choice.

The regular rooms looked to be small, we chose a suite for the extra room and for the small extra charge, consider it to be a good decision. The first floor restaurant is rated one of the better in the City. The Chef was one of the winners on the Top Chef TV show. Hotel guests get a 20% discount.

The reason for our trip was a surprise for my husbands 40th birthday. On arrival to the hotel, we were pleasantly greeted and helped with our luggage then excited to reception. Now when we got there, and i realise this is more the fault of the travel agent, we were told we needed to leave a credit card as \"security\". I dont have a credit card. So they said i could leave cash to the amount of $50 a day. We came on this trip on a budget so tried to explain and ended up having to leave $100 at the front desk, This was still a hefty amount from our budget. The room was spotless and the service from the cleaning/room staff was impecable. (although i do reiterate the feelings of a fellow trip advisor about the sheets on the bed) Although we soon realised that we hadnt received our welcome pack (ipod walking tour) pillow selections etc. We also werent told about the bar, opening times of restaurant and bar, fitness centre etc so ended up just wandering and finding things ourselves. When it came to the end of our trip, i went to reception to see if they could help with our bookings for airport express and also our bookin in for flights. One of the staff (Mike im sure his name was) seemed to be slightly .........annoyed and put out by doing this. When he was on the phone to the express transport people he spoke as if i wasnt there and some sort of second class citizen \"i have someone here who THINKS she has a booking, but she has no information so i dont know\" and \"well she says she has a booking but no references\" He then got me a booking reference, (which i had explained i had on my ticket) I then left the desk as didn not want to put him out further with the whole flight booking thing to. I came back to the desk and had a VERY VERY NICE gentleman called Jeff who was more than helpful and went out of his way to be nice. This man deserves praise!!!! I then avoided the front desk when i saw Mike as i felt that he had belittled my and didnt not want that experience repeated. When it came to checking out - the lady on the desk said they would send someone to check the mini bar then refund out $100. fine i thought. Then i was told i was being charged just over $24 for a bottle of wine i hadnt drunk!!! we said we had used nothing at all and then they went a second time to inspect the room and FOUND the bottle of wine , makes you think what if someone doesnt check their bill? All in all, a good room, some very nice staff, some very not so nice staff. But purely because of the staff im unsure as if i would stay there again.

So, here we go....My wife, myself, and 5 others stayed from Oct. 11-15 for the Marathon. Affinia is nicely located less than a block off of Magnificent Mile. So good spot for shopping. Ginos East next door, and Corner Bakery not far away. Staff were pleasant but I was surprised by some of the staff at the front desk at how they didn't know the answers to some location questions that someone in that role needs to know. The bell staff were very friendly, and quite frankly more helpful; especially Joel who was very engaging and kindly remembered our name everytime he saw us. The amenities were just fine; the beds and pillows comfortable though not quiet, the bathrooms quite funky and very sizeable. There are some dissapointments however. Firstly, and no fault of the hotel is their location. One is temporary, the other not. The building next door is under construction, so nice and early each morning there was a great deal of noise. I didnt know that the legal time to begin was 6:30, 'cause thats when they started.....also if your room faces E. Superior you will be serenaded by ambulances all night long, especially weekends as the hospital is right at the corner. Big city life......Now the real dissapointment that did leave a bad taste in our mouth. On the weekend a couple of us went up to C-View, the rooftop bar for a night-cap. It was very lively. On Monday night I wanted to spend a little alone time up there for a late night cocktail and to enjoy the view with my wife. We got to the door to the patio and were immediately approached by a sever who told us that the patio was closed, that it closes at 11 p.m. (it was 11:06) and that they were just trying to clear things up. (it didnt seem like the other 7-8 people seated comfortably were going anywhere soon). We walked inside and were passed by another server who said hello and continued to walk by without asking us if we wanted a beverage. It was clear by all of the candles on the tables burnt (or blown out) that they were hoping to go home, and soon. While it didnt ruin the weekend thankfully, it would have been great end to have had a celebratory cocktail with my wife who ran the marathon the day before and enjoy a really nice view. Management really has to understand how something simple like a poor attitude and poor ambassadorship by staff can make a customer think of going elsewhere in the future. Overall a decent place to stay but I am certain there are better. Thanks for reading. Just so everyone knows, I could not recommend this hotel to a friend if their room faces E.

Thank you Affinia for putting them at desk height so I didn't have to scramble about on the floor by the bed! A very comfortable working experience. 3 steps down the room opened into a large space. One side had a 3 seater sofa, armchair and contemporary ottoman the left side - where I held meetings with 2-3 other colleagues over the duration of my stay. The room also had a 42\" plasma TV that we could hook up to our laptops from the sofa. Staff were very friendly. Gave us great restaurant recommendations and helped with faxing documents with no fuss or charge. Check out was painless with the paperwork and final check mailed to me.

The hotel is located directly off Michigan Avenue on the wonderfully named Superior Street. The lobby is huge, high ceilings, marble floors, with attentive doorman and friendly welcoming front desk staff. The lady was very pleasant and chatty and gave us a lovely introduction to the hotel and the city. Our room was on the 6th floor and was very large for a basic twin room. Two huge King size beds with lots of comfortable cushions and pillows. There was an extensive pillow menu to choose from also, but the ones provided were excellent. One entire wall of the room was the window, looking out right down the city block with amazing views of the city's sky scrapers to the south. The room was always bright and clean and with all the space, it was a joy to relax in after a long day strolling around the city. The bathroom is undeniably the best I've ever had in a hotel room. Including staying in suites at 5 star European hotels. The room is long, with plenty of space and a huge, walk in shower, that was almost the size of a normal entire bathroom in most hotels. The washbasin and mirror are a design feature alone. A massive circular mirror with it's own light regulation feature ensures you're never blinded or pasty, as one appears in most fluorescent lit hotel bathrooms. Indeed, all the lights in the bathroom (including INSIDE the shower) can be regulated from dimmer switches at the door. There's plenty of closet space, the desk is large and useful, there's also two ottomans that are handy for sitting on or laying your belongings on. Nearby the hotel is a small corner breakfast place called Pierre Gourmet's. If anyone was staying at this hotel or in the area, I would implore them to eat here. It's an amazing place, sit down, table service, beautiful selection of breakfast foods, with a dearth of choice of breads. Don't expect to find many bars nearby, my friend and I looked each night within walking distance and found none. Other nice food recommendations are the Ralph Lauren Grill which is at the corner of 115 E Chicago Ave, they do an amazing steak sandwich and have amazingly chic and interesting client\u00c3\u00a8le.

This was our second stay at Affinia Chicago, so we knew pretty much what we were in store for and, again, we were prepared to pay a small premium for the greater level of service & comfort. We were delighted with everything on the first go-round, but we had a few less-than-sterling things occur on this trip. Good: Location -- within a chip shot of Michigan Ave, so right there in the thick of things yet away from the high traffic of the Magnificent Mile. The traffic on Superior St and St.Clair Ave is unusually high for narrow side streets but this was not a factor for us; we don't mind a little traffic noise but a light sleeper might struggle with that. Room Quality -- very good. Well appointed, reasonably fresh with nice furnishings. The washrooms are exceptional, actually. The bed & pillows are among the best I've had in any hotel. The TV was large (flat screen) and well positioned but I cannot speak for the picture quality or programming as we had it on for all of 2 minutes each morning to check the weather. Staff -- Generally good. The front desk staff are responsive & accommodating and the doormen are friendly enough (though it is still unclear to me why they have so many as they never seem to be doing very much). The not-so-good: Room Quality -- whilst the main part of the room was well maintained the window frames and blinds were filthy. The hotel was renovated within the last 3 or 4 years and I wonder if this area has been addressed since then. Also, the A/C or air exchanger ran constantly the entire time we were there. That, in itself, was not a problem, as the temperature was comfortable and I kind of like the \"white noise\" at night, but I was curious about it. I popped the cover off the unit to see what the settings were and found that the filter within was completely full of dust -- not healthy and not efficient, and this may explain why the unit ran all the time. Staff -- One small beef -- the woman who handled our check was perfectly fine and even did us the courtesy of ensuring that a friend who was meeting us there would be staying on the same floor as us...BUT she put us off a bit by aggressively pushing a variety of tours (river cruises, bus excursions, Segway tours...) and kept adding \"mention my name\". We were left with the impression that her prime concern here was ensuring that her \"considerations\" from the tour operators would continue. Maybe that was not the case AT ALL, but that's the vibe we got. One BIG beef -- after cleaning our room the housekeeper neglected to close the door to our room! Nothing was taken while the door was left ajar but the potential for disaster was obviously very high. So, after such a perfect stay back in 2009 we were a *little* disappointed with a couple of small things and one potentially ruinous thing.

Prior reviews led us to believe this was a quality hotel; not true. Since it was a very special occasion, and also because we were only staying overnight, we didn't let the shabbiness and poor service of the hotel ruin our weekend. However, this would have qualified as one of the poorest hotel experiences. I've ever had. First, the smells: The linens and pillows on our bed smelled moldy and mildewy. The odors were not mild, and I found it pretty repulsive. I couldn't wait to jump out of bed in the morning, to get away from the odors. Hard to sleep and certainly didn't want to be in the bed any longer than absolutely necessary. I didn't discover how disgusting the bed smelled until around midnight when we got into bed. At that point, I chose not to contact housekeeping because (a) I was exhausted, and (b) I didn't want to upset my husband, who had fallen immediately to sleep after a long day of sightseeing. Also, the bathroom smelled like vinegar. Perhaps this is the cleaning agent used by Affinia, but the odor should have dissipated over the course of our stay and it never did. Incidentally, the bathroom floor tiles and wallpaper looked like they had seen better days; not a well-maintained property. Second, the elevators: If you stay above the first few floors, there are only two elevators that run from ground level to the rooftop c-view bar. With so many floors to service, and so many people going up to the c-view bar on a saturday, these elevators took forever to come, and were often full they did. Annoying. Also, on one occasion, there were several bottles (water and soda) left in the elevator; clearly, the maintenance crew doesn't inspect and clean the common areas frequently. Finally, and perhaps the most disappointing was the service when we arrived. First, when we booked, we asked for as quiet a room as possible. The hotel is located near Northwestern Memorial Hospital. But, its proximity to Michigan Ave., and the lack of accomodations elsewhere (due to the Transformers movie filming and a big international convention taking place the same week-end), led us to stay here anyway. At check-in, the clerk noted our request, and said our room was quiet room since it was not \"next to the elevators.\" When we arrived at our room, we discovered that we were across from the elevators. Obviously, she was technically correct that we weren't next to the elevators, but it was still so close (15-20 feet) that we could hear the elevator noise. Also, since it was a special occasion, we asked if we could upgrade. The disingenuous, snarky, condescending clerk told us that checking in early was an upgrade. Clearly, the woman has not travelled enough to know that in many quality hotels, this is a matter of routine, not exception. Pretty awful experience all the way around. Other reviewers must have very low expectations. Can't explain any of the good reviews otherwise.", "Date": "July 19, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Sydney, Australia", "Title": "\u201cBest ever staff\u201d", "Author": "justin_wong", "ReviewID": "UR71427119", "Content": "The location is superb.

I was surprised at the low cost in such an exclusive area! So when we got there and the area was good and safe, the hotel looked exactly as it did in the photos we were relieved. Sometimes you read reviews and wonder if the person actually stayed in the same place as you. The person who said the beds weren't great? The bed was the THE single best bed I have EVER slept on in a hotel and the pull out couch was actually not too bad either. The room had some outside noise but so would any hotel next to a hospital - there are plenty of other hotels in the area which would have the same problem. I always use earplugs in a hotel anyway. We did not hear a single sound from other rooms or the hall. And the decor somewhat up to date? - it was trendy and fantastic. And also, not sure about other rooms but MINE had a mini bar - they all are supposed to. For the most part I found this a great hotel especially for the price. However, we did not find it ideal when travelling with kids. There are no 1 bedroom suites so there is no privacy and the TV swivels both ways but still everyone had to hear the same stuff. The coffee maker in our room did not work so we went out for coffee as hotel coffee is never very good anyway. They did have all that overpriced food and drinks in the room to buy including wine, yet there was no corkscrew or wine glasses. That means you have to call down for them and everytime you do that of course it costs money. Of course not much, but really they should be provided. No microwave either. The hotel has no free breakfast or free wifi(it's like $10 per DAY!) - go to Starbucks. I found that charge really steep. Free breakfast is handy for kids and every meal in CHicago is expensive so anything free would help. We loved the fact that when we joked with the front desk person when they asked us if there was anything they could do and I said we'd like a line pass for the HUGE line up outside Ginos East next door we were given a pass card and basically walked right in at dinner time when there was an hour wait outside! The rooftop bar was much smaller than in looked on the website and although the ambiance was nice, the outside part was closed, and the music was not really loud enough nor interesting enough. The drink prices were astounding for what was basically a boring evening. The housekeeping staff was good and very accommodating when we needed a late room clean. The room was always very clean but we were often short a couple of pillows and a sheet. I do not know what the pillow menu thing is but I know it involved calling down and again another charge. Seemed a little deceptive to me - I thought they would have special pillows in the room. The thing that really upset me was the night before we were to leave I could not figure out the alarm so I called for an early wake up call. This call never came and we just barely made our flight. If there had been any problems on the way we would have missed our flight. All in all, based on the room, location and price I would stay here again if I did not have my kids -($15.95 - to watch one series of TV shows for 90 minutes that are free at home!) If you have kids I would recommend somewhere with more child-friendly ammenities.

The rooms are quite large and roomy and reasonably up to date. 3. Good adjoining restaurant (C-House by Markus Samuellson), with good staff. 4. Nice rooftop bar. 5. Excellent location. Good neighboorhood, next to the magnificent mile, next to a good deep pan pizza place, close to the lake. For the bad: 1. The worst was the sleep. The beds are not the best to start with. Second, the location, as this is next to the Northwestern Medical Uni, there are a fair amount of Ambulances driving through the adjoining streets, and therefore you should be prepared to be woken up frequently. The soundproofing is bad as well. The windows are not double glazing and therefore you can hear the ambulances like if you were on the street and we were on the higher floors! The door out to the corridor is for some reason of some sort of wood that lets all sounds through as well. If there is someone talking in the corridor, you will hear their every word. If someone loud lives in the room across the hall, you can again hear their every word. So, sound is the biggest problem here and due to it, I did not have a lot of sleep, even after long days sightseeing in Chicago and falling into bed every night, I was not able to get a good nights rest. After arriving home after the weekend, I needed sleep! 2. Two slow elevators for most of the Hotel. With a roof top bar that is open to the public, you can have a lot of traffic at the elevators to get back to your room. Plus the elevators are super slow which doesn't help. 3. No minibar! I am used to hotels of the same status as the Affinia having a minibar in the room. Would have been nice with a little fridge to store our water etc. I find minibars in most hotels I stay at and find them super useful, but not here. They even have loads of space to put one, but none were to be found.

ROOM: The room included an office space, living room, bathroom, safe, queen size bed, and a 32\" LCD TV which swiveled. The room was very clean. Housekeeping never intruded and we had no problems with anything missing or being misplaced. The bar bridge is full stocked and there is a tray of candy/snacks for purchase. My only issue with the room would be the noise factor from sirens in the middle of the night. This is no fault of the hotel itself, but its proximity to the hospital made for some late night sirens to disturb your sleep. Other than that, everything was great. FOOD: We ate at both the C-House restaurant and the C-view rooftop patio. Only appetizers are served at the rooftop lounge, but they were very good. Highly recommend the cheese platter and meats assortment. C-House is the main level restaurant. We visited for a dinner and a breakfast and both meals were amazing. The service was good and we had nothing buy great food and drinks. LOCATION: The hotel is right beside Ginos Pizza, on Superior St and Michigan Ave. It is walking distance to all the shopping and about a 10 km walk to Navy Pier. If you plan on walking all day, I recommend considering a cab from the hotel to Navy Pier. It cost us roughly 8 dollars including tip, so it was well worth it for us in terms of time. The Peninsula, which is down the street from the Affinia, had two NBA players staying there during the long weekend. Dwayne Wade and Chris Bosh were there which was amazing! The food around the hotel is also very good. STAFF: The best part of our stay would have to be the service of the hotel staff.

We arrived early so there were no rooms available, but we were checked in well before the standard 3pm check in time.

The only issue we had here was that it took some time for us to get the luggage after we went to the room. I had to make a phone call to the front desk to check on the status of our bags, and they eventually came not long after. The bell hop, Danial, was very apologetic and he spent some time explaining the city, gave us some helpful tips, and even recommended a breakfast eatery. We were very pleased with his recommendation and his overall service; he also remembered our names to the end of our stay -- this holds a lot of weight with me in a service oriented position! The guest services were very helpful in terms of getting around the city and booking reservations for us in Chicago.

He was friendly and even gave us several recommendations on what to do and where to go while simultaneously while working on the HVAC. We barely had our coats off by the time it was up & running. However, the most impressive display of service was the response to an unfortunate incident that happened to us while parked across the city (not anywhere near this hotel or their parking garage) at a late hour of the night. My car window was smashed and items were stolen. When we returned to the hotel after the incident they were more than helpful. They not only let us park the car in front of the hotel until we had spoken with the police, but also helped us to affix something temporary to the window (which was helpful for the single digit temperatures). They guided us to our car in the valet garage to assess the damage the next day and offered to let us extend our checkout time if necessary. What could have been a lot of added stress in an unfamiliar environment turned out to be a comfortable safe haven. I would recommend this hotel to anyone. Hopefully others won't have the drama we did and won't ever witness this type of service, but if you do they'll be there to help you through it.

I booked 4 rooms on PriceLine and got an excellent rate. I called the hotel after making the reservations and let them know that we needed 2 beds in each room. I was told it would be noted on our reservation however could not be guaranteed. When we arrived in Chicago I was told that they were completely out of 2 bed rooms. It wasn't a huge deal but would have been more comfortable if we had a room with 2 queens instead of a queen and a pull out couch. Actually, the bed seemed more like a full than a queen. The room was very modern and nicely decorated. As we walked in there was a desk immediately in front of us and then you went down 2 steps into the actual room which had a pull out couch, an ottoman, TV and bed. The room was very clean however I can not give it the highest clean score because the ottoman was absolutely disgusting. It had stains all over it, even down the side where it looked like something had spilled. Since this was one of the first things we saw as we entered the room we were a little unsure what we got ourselves into. This was however an exception to everything else which was very clean. One drawback to this hotel is the high cost of every little thing. Internet access was I think $10 a day and you could access the Internet through the room TV however that was $10 for just a few hours. Even coffee and tea had a charge. The mini bar was very well stocked but we avoided using it because of the high cost. Parking is also outrageous - $48 per day! The view was also not very good...we were looking directly into an office building, but really that wasn't a big deal. The best thing about this hotel would have to be the location! It was convenient to EVERYTHING! It was unusually warm in Chicago that weekend so we walked everywhere and never had to use a cab. You can walk to all of the stores on the mag mile as well as Navy Pier and Millennium Park. There is a pizza place right next door that always had a huge line out the door. Ask the concierge for a pass and you can skip the entire line plus get free bread sticks! The staff were all very nice. The concierge was always happy to give advice and answer questions and on our last day when we wanted to do a few things after checkout they were very nice about storing our luggage for us at no charge until we were ready to leave. We ate at the hotel restaurant for breakfast. It was awful and expensive. I ordered a meal that came with eggs and bacon and my bacon looked like it came out of the refrigerator and onto my plate...so I asked if they could cook it longer and the waiter came back a few seconds later and the bacon looked exactly the same. I just took it and didn't eat it...a total waste of $14! I would recommend eating someplace else for breakfast...we didn't try this restaurant for any other meals. The rooftop bar is nice and had a great atmosphere. Because it was warm we were able to sit outside which was very nice. As for the elevators which a lot of people complain about, I did not find them a problem. We were on the 14th floor and never felt like we had to wait an exceptionally long time.

The view isn't bad from the room, you should definately head up the bar and check out the view from there. Drink prices at the bar where comparable to any place else in the city. Many people complained about the hosiptal noise, i didn't notice it at all. However Supieror is under construction, so maybe the ambulances are using a different route. I will admit the elevators are a bit slow and small. I wouldn't even consider trying to drive here and park. Rates start at $22 for an hour or less, we took the train into the city so we didn't have to worry about it thankfully. All in all a good hotel, definately a good place to stay if you are in town to shop the Magnificent Mile, good location for most things.

All very modern with great appointments. Large, modern bathroom with a great shower, (water pressure a little low - wonder if they are saving the planet), lots of mirrors everywhere and VERY clean.

The first suite we were given had an air vent for the building right outside our fourth floor window that emitted a constant, droning sound. This would have prohibited a good night's sleep. So we requested a room change. We were offered one on the 28th floor, with a queen. Although we originally had reserved a king suite we were open to a queen, if that was all that was available. But when we made the move to the room we found the queen was barely a double. A great view of the of the city, but a double? Seriously, what's right about that? The third try appeared to be a winner, 28th floor...floor to ceiling windows, leather appointed living room, really nice..... we could finally kick off the shoes and stick around. But get this, have you ever seen a sign next to the coffee maker that says \"Coffee $1.00/Tea $.50\" ? I can't make this up, I'm not that creative! I have never seen that before... Nestea tea bags and a no-name coffee, topped off with foam cups. Sets a real tone here, doesn't it? Follow that up with a concierge who's total eatery knowledge must consist of Taco Bell. Thank goodness for cell phones and Andy's Jazz Club understanding...We were repeatedly assured that we would not need a reservation, but definitely found that not to be the case. An hour and a half later our lack of a reservation limited us to a table in the bar, added a $10.00 cover charge per person, and put a time limit on our stay. But that was only the beginning......the most memorable moment came at about 1:00 am. Are you ready?\" My husband discovered a LEAK in the bathroom....directly ABOVE THE TOILET Yes, from an access panel in the ceiling. He was the lucky one to find it, or experience it, whatever the case may be. It's so much fun calling the desk at that time of night and having a maintenance guy in your room at 1:30 am. Did I mention the elevator wait averaged 5 minutes? So I guess making it up to the room by 1:25 am must have been a record. The employee mopped the water up around the toilet and sink with THE BATH MAT and HAND TOWELS, then left, assuring us he could fix the leak. Fifteen minutes later we received a phone call saying the leak had been fixed and they thought the leak had been from the restaurant ice machine on the floor above. Did I mention the wet bath mat and towels were left for us to clean up? For all this trouble, hassle, and down right creepiness and a total of $60.00 plus tax was taken off our bill.

The room felt old to me, with trendy furnishings and wallpaper added to try and make it better. It was very clean, but there was peeling paint on the baseboard and the windows were old. The furnishings were very nice though, especially the large flat screen TV. We liked the three steps down from the entryway to the bed and desk area, it made it less generic. Overall the room was fairly small. The rooms are not soundproof either. You could hear people talking in the hallway and the doors slam closed. Luckily there aren't many rooms on each floor, so we didn't hear the noises too often. The bathrooms were fairly nice, but the bright orange wallpaper was a bit much. The Aveda toiletries were nice though. The best and worst part of our stay was the location. You can't beat being one block from Water Tower if you're there to shop, it was great. The worst part of the location was being across the street from the emergency room at Northwestern Memorial Hospital. I was awakened several times by ambulance sirens. I am used to night noise and sirens because we live on a busy street in the city, but these sirens were definitely louder than I'm used to. The service was decent, but nothing special. We did ask to have special pillows from their pillow menu brought to our room. They were waiting when we got back from shopping. My husband likes the Swedish contour pillows, and I got the magnetic therapy pillow. It really wasn't great, pretty flat and hard. The overnight parking fee was a bit high, $48 for 24 hours.

I read dozens of reviews before choosing this hotel, and I carefully made reservations through expedia for a room with 2 double beds. My first impression of the hotel was shot, when we walked in to check in. We were told by a front desk manager that no rooms with double beds were available. When I told her I reserved one through expedia, she said that expedia only reserves the number of beds, not the room type requested. She was going to assign us to a room with a king and a pullout--completely unacceptable with the hotel costs and not very fun for one mom's getaway. When I insisted that we get what I reserved and paid for and pulled out our itinerary with expedia showing a room with 2 double beds, she made several calls to housekeeping to check the status of rooms and finally found one for us. Once we got to our room, we were thrilled--beautiful, new, modern, comfortable, pretty, with a gorgeous view of the city. We loved the 4 soft pillows per bed, the sheets, and the reading lights on the headboard. The aveda toiletries were fun too. The down part--the 28 floor hotel only has 2 small elevators (6 people max) and everyone seemed frustrated by how long it would take to get up or down--even the hotel staff. The rooftop bar was fun, but expensive! My bailey's on ice was $14.50 before tip. ($10 for the bailey's, $3 for the rocks, and $1.50 for tax). Tip--don't pay for the continental breakfast.

We stayed at Affinia for three nights. Rooms: The rooms are good-sized, comparable to a 4/5 star chain hotel. In this respect, Affinia is better than your average boutique hotel. The room in includes a large tv and a good-sized writing desk. The bathroom is average sized, some might think it on the small side. It didn't bother me, but there isn't a large vanity for higher-maintenance travelers. Service: The front desk/concierge were always very friendly in greeting us when we walked through the lobby or asked for anything. The room included free Wi-Fi (ask at the front desk). We did get stuck in the elevator for about 15 minutes (apparently we aren't the first, reading other reviews). The staff were attentive and tried to deal with the situation as quickly as possible, but the elevators are small and obviously old. Being stuck in a small space with three other people was, at best, annoying. Location: The hotel is in what seemed to be a safe location. My friend (a young woman) and I felt safe walking around at night. It is within walking distance from two famous pizza places: Gino's East is next door and Giordano's is three short blocks away. Further away, there are some homeless hanging around the nearby Walgreen's, but nothing that made us feel unsafe. You will run into panhandlers, but that is true of pretty much any big U.S. city. The hotel is right by the Magnificent Mile (shopping), but far from the cultural sights. Of course, if you want to stay closer to the Art Institute/Millennium Park, you will pay more for it. One drawback is that the hotel is not really close to an El train stop on the Loop. So, if you want to get to the Art Institute or other neighborhoods via the Loop, it can be time consuming. It is close to the State St. Red line (which runs north/south), which you can take and then transfer to a line that runs the Loop. We found ourselves wasting a lot of time doing this, so it might be worth it to take a cab. Or, it is possible that we weren't savvy enough to figure out how to use the El efficiently. Restaurant/Bar: We didn't use the restaurant to order any food, nor did we go to the rooftop bar. Bottom Line: Given the relatively low price of this hotel, I think it is a good choice for couples, friends, or solo travelers. I wouldn't stay here for a special occasion (unless I were trying to save money), but it was perfect for a short trip to Chicago with a friend.", "Date": "July 31, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "2", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "MangoGT", "Title": "\u201cNot Ready for Prime Time\u201d", "Author": "MangoGT", "ReviewID": "UR35294547", "Content": "We were a party of 4 (with 2 dogs) staying at the Affinia Chicago during a busy convention weekend--although we were not attending the expo. We had high expectations of this hotel based on the mostly positive TripAdvisor reviews and the services offered on the Affinia website. Check-In: We wanted to check in 1 hour early and called ahead to ask if the room would be ready. We were assured that it would and timed our day appropriately. Upon arriving, we learned (from a fairly rude front desk clerk) that we would need to pay $30 extra per adult per night for my brother and sister-in-law. This was shocking as we had confirmed 4 adults in our original reservation and requested amenities for 4 adults, but were never told that there would be an additional charge of $60/night. The front desk clerk added that our rate was already well below their nightly rate and this is their standard policy. I had booked my room directly on the Affinia website--not through a 3rd party--so I was surprised to hear that my rate was TOO low. I accepted the new charge but we weren't given a room. Instead, we were asked to wait until the room was ready--which we were warned would be up to an hour. After waiting for a while, we were told that it would be about 15 more minutes. We had some activities planned so we asked them to hold our luggage and call when the room would be ready. We never received a phone call--and the room wasn't ready until 3 hours later. Room: We booked a junior suite--which was supposedly two classes above a standard room. While the room was of decent size and contained two beds, it was not a suite by any standard. There was no separation between the two beds (it was one straight, long room). The furnishings were modern and the room was clean, but the overall layout was very awkward. Amenities: The Affinia website boasts all sorts of amenities that will be brought to your room upon arrival. Out of the 4 or 5 amenities that we requested (including a yoga kit and walking maps), I think we only received 2 \"special\" pillows. A note about the pillows: despite booking a junior suite for 4 adults, the hotel has a policy of allowing only 2 \"special\" pillows per room. Concierge: We are familiar with Chicago and already knew where we would be eating meals and spending our time. However, we did ask the concierge for directions to a location for a river cruise with the Chicago Architecture Foundation. The directions we received were entirely incorrect, and as a result, we missed our tour. Luckily, the CAF rebooked us on a later cruise. Very unprofessional for the Affinia Concierge to provide incorrect directions. Further, several times that we asked for our car it was over 30 minutes late, and on a couple of occasions, never called at all. Bell Service: The bell service was a source of a lot of humor, anxiety, and frustration for us. The first gentleman that greeted us was pleasant and tried to make conversation. He later greeted us again when he brought our luggage to the room--and asked the exact same questions. We learned that he was reading a script out of a notepad. The same gentleman also explained every single feature of the room to us, as if we had never stayed in a hotel--or used a telephone, closet, safe, minibar, bathtub, sink, etc. A quick note about the luggage: when we originally checked in we were told that we could retrieve our own luggage upon returning when the room was ready--but we found that it was fiercely guarded by the bell staff that firmly told us otherwise and essentially pushed us away. Overall, most of the staff came off as overbearing and creepy, although one fellow that spent most of his time outside did stand out as being genuinely pleasant. Conclusion: The location of this hotel and the modern rooms are very nice. However, there are several areas of service where the hotel is truly lacking. VIsitors that have stayed in true upscale hotels will surely notice this, but for the majority of people this place is fine. We will be back in downtown Chicago but we won't be back to the Affinia. If anyone reads all the way through this review we would recommend the Intercontinental, Fairmont, or any of the Kimpton Hotels instead for a reasonably priced luxury hotel. Final Note: I raised my concerns directly to Claudia Eggspuhler, the general manager. While she was kind about inviting me to sit and speak with her candidly, her response to my comments was essentially to agree with me and note that other visitors have voiced the same problems. She did not make me feel that my business was appreciated, nor did she genuinely seem interested in having us return. She offered a free breakfast if we come back, but I can afford breakfast. I just want better service. It appears that many of the issues that we observed with this hotel may stem from apathetic upper management, which is unfortunate for a property with so much potential.", "Date": "July 20, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Brooklyn, New York", "Title": "\u201cSuperb Service\u201d", "Author": "kimbaetiquette", "ReviewID": "UR35105225", "Content": "My husband and I booked a one week vacation at the Affinia on Superior Street after reading the positive reviews on this site.

The location is good, we are walkers, so we had no problem taking our time to walk around the city. The only problem in the area that we encountered was that we arrived late on a Friday night - around 11pm - and it took us quite a while to find a restaurant in the area that was open and still serving dinner (not just bar food). Many of the restaurants in the immediate area were shutting down, which was a surprise to us since we're used to restaurants being open quite late. We did manage to find a place, though, that was open 'till 4am, but the owner informed us that he believes he is one of two restaurants open that late in the area. Our only complaint within the hotel itself was that only half the elevators were working which meant that we had to wait quite a while to go up and down to our room on the 23rd floor. This also meant that when the elevators did come, they were uncomfortably packed and definitely often above the posted capacity, which made me a little nervous.

We prefer boutique hotels and Chicago has a lot of them as well. We picked Affinia because of its location near the lakeshore where we wanted to go for morning runs and the price was unbeatable. About six weeks before our trip, the hotel website was offering a special rate. We booked and prepaid for a junior suite averaging $186 per night. The hotel is located just off the Magnificent Mile so was a great location for shopping. A short walk south on Michigan Avenue will take you across the Chicago River to Millennium and Grant Park where we also wanted to go. And with the proximity to the lakeshore pathway, the location for us was ideal. The hotel has a number of extra amenities including C Restaurant, a 29th floor roof top bar, in room spa services and a fitness center. We had a lunch and a breakfast at the restaurant and enjoyed a nice meal and pleasant service each time. The roof top bar on the 29th floor provided a good view all the way to Millennium Park and over the rooftops of nearby buildings on Michigan Avenue while sipping on a drink and soaking in a bit of sunshine. We did not try out the spa services or fitness center. The room itself was very comfortable. Lots of room with a spacious sitting area and a flat screen tv which could be swung around to face either the bed or the sitting areas. The bathroom, like most boutique hotels, was stylish but small. A vanity area helped ease bathroom congestion. The hotel offers a pillow menu of six different types of pillows. I tried the Swedish memory pillow which offered extra neck support and supposedly eased tension. Hard to tell since I was on vacation and tension was not a concern. The hotel also offers experience kits. I took the stay fit one with a yoga mat, work out DVDs, etc. but did not use it much since we were running each morning. They also offer a walking tour kit and a picnic kit. The room has a coffee maker and coffee free of charge. We did not sample from the mini bar nor use room service dining. We wanted ice and wine glasses had to request that each afternoon but delivery was very prompt. Housekeeping kept the room clean.

The one negative aspect was the noise from building construction next door. The single pane windows did not reduce the noise level by much, so it was noticeable each morning. If you want to sleep in late, which we did not, you may not want to stay at this hotel. Another minor annoyance was the elevator.

Hotel \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the hotel itself is modern, classy and inviting and includes a rooftop lounge/bar area with great views of the city. There is a restaurant located within the hotel which has an excellent brunch menu and outdoor seating. The hotel also has many free services including toiletries, guide books with iPods containing walking tours, and pillow selection. Customer Service \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the staff is very friendly and helpful \u00e2\u20ac\u201c from the front desk to the doormen. Chicago: I would recommend 2 items to consider when visiting Chicago. 1) The city offers a free service which matches you with a guide who will give you a walking tour of a section of the city of your choice. The guides are very knowledgeable and you get to see places you probably wouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t. I highly recommend it: http://www.chicagogreeter.com 2) the second is to eat at Japanois on W Chicago Ave. Eat upstairs then head down to their river-side lounge area for drinks. A couple minor issues noted: the elevators are very slow to the upper floors and paying for wireless internet access is awful as this is included from most hotels. In sum, if you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re looking for great value, great location, friendly staff, and a modern hotel, book at Affinia Chicago.", "Date": "June 11, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "denver, co", "Title": "\u201cNot As Impressive As We Hoped--Luke Warm\u201d", "Author": "Traveler1Denver_Co", "ReviewID": "UR31501430", "Content": "I spent nearly a week at the Affinia while on business. I chose the hotel because of the reviews I read in this forum. I typically stay at the large hotel chains. We arrived at about 8pm and the bell/doorman working was absolutely wonderful. He was there throughout our stay, new our names, greeted us like family, and was the brightest spot of our stay. When checking in we found no soap, shampoo, or other ammenities. Light bulbs were missing-the lamps were in poor shape and hanging by a thread, etc. Just lots of very small but irritating problems. We never had a thorough job cleaning in our 6 days...the night housekeeping staff came up every night with things forgotten by the day cleaners. We were on the 7th floor but if you are above that good luck. On two occasions we tried to make it up to the roof-top bar and gave up after 15 minutes of waiting on an elevator. It is shameful how long some folks waited to get to and from their rooms. Many guests would take the one elevator to 7 and walk the rest of the way. We found the hotel front desk staff bored and marginally interested in any of our questions or issues. Sure we got done what we needed to but there was no real interest. I have no idea what expectations the other reviewers have of a hotel but this place is really luke warm, at best. The hotel restaurant is a farce. It is totally pretentious for no good reason. The food is way over-priced as are the drinks...$13 for a house specialty that really isn't special. All in all it is equal to the likes of an Embassy Suites without the free breakfast.

The only downside to its location is it's right in the middle of several hospitals, one of which has an emergency section, which means Ambulance sirens ring out consistently throughout the day and night, otherwise the rooms are pretty quiet. One of the best things about the Affinia Hotel, was the Pillow Menu - you can choose from 6 different types of pillows! which was fantastic for both of us, as we don't like the standard feather down pillows that eventually turn into a thin wad of fabric by the morning.

I took advantage of Affinia's $149/night special and was required to pay with my credit card immediately in order to get this rate, and it was non-refundable as explained clearly by Affinia's reservation desk. A couple days before our arrival, an email comes in , saying that I've been switched to The James, a sister property of the Affinia.I wrote back, saying that I did not want or like this and that the amenities at the James were not as luxurious as the Affinia and that the James is rated around #12 on tripadvisor and the Affinia #4. There was a VERY quick response to my reply, but the answer was that I had no choice in the matter, and nothing was offered as compensation. I believed that I had no choice but to stay at the James, because, as I had mentioned, payment was due upon booking and was non-refundable.Being without choice , my wife and I did what anyone without a choice would do, we stayed at the James. ( I will leave a review for the James as well.) Upon checkout at the James, I was handed a bill for $149 for 2 nights plus taxes. There was a tremendous amount of confusion , as I told the James staff that I was already paid-up and they insisted that I still had a bill. I refused to pay until they checked with the Affinia. What happened was that Affinia had refunded my money to my card and they DID NOT tell me and they did not tell the James staff . I could have stayed elsewhere than the James (and I would have) but my transfer email from the Affinia nor their response to my complaint in any way shape or form indicted that my money had been refunded and I was no longer obliged to take the $149/night deal. I am left with a bait-and -switch feeling, booking at particular hotel and being switched late in the game to a lesser hotel.I also feel that it should have been explained to me that I was not obliged to stay at the second hotel, but this was not done because it is my believe that they did not want to lose the booking.

PROS: - Customer service is outstanding! Front desk staff, doormen, housekeeping, even random employees met in the elevators... all extremely friendly and helpful. - Comfortable bed with lots of pillow options, from buckwheat to 'sound' pillows with built-in iPod speakers! I tried the memory foam, which took some time to get used to, but it was fun to try. - Very clean and seemingly well maintained (with one exception... see cons). Cleaning crew came through at a good time in mid-morning and did a good job, and also seemed to abide by the towel-reuse program. - Good geographic location, one block from Michigan Ave, with a Corner Bakery, Gino's Pizza, and Elephant & Castle within a very short distance. CONS: - Elevators are being worked on, and only ONE is in service at a time right now. Anticipated completion is May '09 I believe. However, the desk staff did mention that if ever we needed immediate service, all we had to do was ask and we would be taken to the freight elevator. The wait for the elevator was, at times, up to 5 minutes but I don't believe it exceeded that. - Price point was high next to comparable hotels nearby. (My trip was covered by my employer, otherwise I would not have been able to afford the rate.) - The corner rooms have a two-level design, with a small flight of 3 stairs dividing the upper from the lower. Neither level had a lot of space to store my suitcase; I wound up blocking the mini-bar, which also partially blocked the bathroom door. The extra-large ottoman/bench on the lower level may have been an alternative place, however I didn't want to wrestle my suitcase on the stairs. - THE NOISE. The windows are single-pane and not soundproof at all, and to the east of the hotel is a construction site, complete with jackhammers and trucks beeping during the day. In addition, there is a fire station within 2 blocks. CFD truck sirens seem abnormally loud at 3 a.m.! The walls were well-insulated though; only once was I disturbed by my neighbor and again the windows were to blame for that. - The lighting. There is one overhead light by the entrance, one in the closet which I couldn't find the switch for, a nice pair of lighted mirrors in the bath; but the lights in the main room were inadequate to me. There are two table lamps and one floor lamp, and also 'reading lights' on the headboard which were LED's. I didn't like the amount of light these provided, and besides the headboard lights they were kind of inconvenient to reach. One more overhead light would have been nice. - Lastly, there were no instructions for the wi-fi connection in the guest book. I had to guess which network to use and hope I was using the right one... I believe it is Wayport, which is $9.99 per 24-hour period. I did not eat in the restaurant however my colleague did, and told me it was VERY overpriced ($7 for a plain bowl of oatmeal?!); he also got room service one night and told me it was a mistake as well... not just overpriced but poor selection and not good food either. I mostly enjoyed my stay, however I cannot say I would recommend the Affinia to a friend mainly due to the price and the excessive outside noise.", "Date": "April 9, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Chicago", "Title": "\u201cYou will LOVE this hotel!!\u201d", "Author": "Irreverentgrl", "ReviewID": "UR27677953", "Content": "This hotel is located in the Streeterville neighborhood in the heart of Chicago.

From the moment we arrived and turned our car over to the valet, which is a big step in trust for me, to the next day when they brought it around to load, everything went very well. We had reserved the room under a vacation special, so I have no complaints about the price. I'm not sure how often the special will be duplicated, but no other hotel within range could touch it. The rooms were stylish and with enough space that we didn't trip over each other. the same was true with our daughter's room. Everything was clean and available, as it should be. We had drinks at the rooftop lounge and enjoyed the view of the city from above at night. It was a bit cold, but it was worth it. The lounge is a bit small and a portable heater of some type would have been nice, but I'll attribute both to zoning restrictions. Either way, it's worth checking out. Michigan Ave is just around the corner from the hotel and the restaurants, bistros and cafes are within walking distance. Shopping is equally dangerously close as well if that's your main mission.

The hotel is not good if you have kids, as there is no pool and only a smallish gym area. We did have 2 issues with the hotel. First, we were on our way to our rooms after check-in and the elevator broke down with us in it. The elevator was fixed immediately after we called to the front desk and the staff did nothing but continue to ask if everyone felt okay and was anyone uncomfortable. Upon fixing the elevator the staff offered to comp our drinks at their bar that evening. Second, One of our couples was in a room that had an unexplained \"rattle\". The staff not only moved their room, but upgraded them to a suite without even asking. Despite these 2 hiccups in mechanical issues, they more than made up for it with customer service.

The front desk staff continued to be very friendly as we came and went from the hotel, saying \"have a great afternoon\", \"do you need a umbrella?\" since it was raining, etc...They were always very prompt at retrieving our car from the hotel parking valet as well (which unfortunately ran up our total bill significantly). There was a garage right across the street, but because of the weather, it was more convenient to valet it. The rooms were immaculately clean and well-appointed. There was an abundance of lamps and Aveda products in the bathroom, which was huge! I want to transport this bathroom into my home, it was so luxurious. Very comfortable bed, with an interesting headboard and built in reading lamps, and even a pillow menu to choose from. I decided to give the buckwheat pillow a try, pretty comfy!

We also stopped by the breakfast cafe Pierot Gourmet, just down the street on Surperior and had a lovely, huge breakfast (a bit on the expensive side though since it is attached to a luxury hotel) Did not eat at the hotel at all, the steak restaurant looked pretty empty, but this could be becuase Chicago is fairly empty in the winter because of the weather.

Good eats, and though the slush n snow bitter cold. It was enjoyable. You can walk to lakeshore drive enjoy the view of the lake. I did this twice in the mornings, even though the Affinia has a great fitness center. We opted for public transit and even though cold it was easy buses at least one block in all directions can take you directly to ALL the museums. And also shopping on michigan av as well as state street which not only more shopping but theatre district. I missed patti labelle by not finding out who was going to be at the Chicago. All this is one bus ride away. The train was station was a little further the red line. Accessible by one bus again but you have to walk to Chicago ave which is around the block across from the walgreens. Which be careful has a lot of panhandlers. The housekeeping staff was great, doormen and front desk as expected. HERE is a PARKING tip there lot is as others said $48.00 and you certainly can find better price within a one block radius there are many garages. But, here is what i did I parked further up the street toward the lake but on superior which the hotel is on just past N. Fairbanks (2 blocks from affinia). Its off street meter parking if its weekend it's free. if its weekday you can't park free till 6pm and have to move the car by 9am when the off street is no longer free. it's safer because the hospital area has there own police that patrol the area's in cars. But as this is chicago still don't leave anything visible inside the car take what you can hide the rest. There are a couple of garages that offer early bird parking in by 9am out by 7pm and it cost $16.00. This was the garage one block over from the affinia just walk out the affinia door south on N st clair one block turn right on E. Huron the garage is 150 E. huron. barely block n half. its valet parking. It worked out great because we usually were moving before 9am anyway and were back close enough in the area to take the car out before 7pm. and back out on city transit its fast. Hope this helps if your budget minded. I truly enjoyed my stay at the affinia the noise from the hospital was not that loud or bad I'm from New Orleans use to noise. Had a good view 10th floor.

The location could not have been more perfect as we could see Water Tower Place from our room., so we were about a half block from Michigan Avenue. We booked a regular room, not a suite, so we had the setup where you walk down a few stairs after entering the room to the area where the bed is. The bed had the \"pillow menu\" which I thought was a quaint touch, and the bathroom had the metallic orange wallpaper, which ummm..no.. The bathroom and mini-bar are at the top of the stairs. Our room had a king sized bed and a recliner chair in it. We were happy & surprised that we were able to get into our room late in the morning, well before the offical check in time. We had also prerequested the \"walking tour\" kit and it was delivered shortly after we checked in. We also received a phone call from the desk to ask how everything was, which I thought was a nice touch. The room felt a little cold to me, though, so we cranked up the heat and headed off for our day's adventure. When we got back to the room...hours later...it was still freezing, so we called the desk and they said they would send someone up to check it out. We headed off to the rooftop bar for a drink. It was very pleasant,, as it is on the top floor of the hotel, and you get an excellent view of the city all lit up at night. It would be even better during the summer months, as it was just a bit too cold to actually sit outside, so we just stayed indoors. When we headed back down to our room, the maintenance guy was still there working on the heat, and the room was *still* cold. He told us that the heating system in our room was deifnitely not working & offered to relocate us to the room right next door. He said that our heat should *probably* start working soon, but that the room next door had heat NOW, and the room next door had all of the same amenities as our room did, and he would help us move our luggage to the next door room. We did peak into the room before we moved everything and it did look the same and it did feel warmer. It was something of a hassle to move all of our stuff, but we went ahead and moved it. Only after we were in the new room did we realize that the room was not identical to the first one. First of all, it was at the end of the hall, so the second room was quite a bit smaller than the first one we had. Also, the comfortable reclining chair that my husband just loved sitting in was not in the second room. (There was just a small ottoman, sorry not the same). The work desk was about half the size of the one in our first room. We were rather disappointed, as after walking around the city all day, that recliner chair had looked quite comfortable. We saw the maintenance guy in the hall and asked if the heat was now okay in our first room, and he said that it was, and we decided to haul all of our things back to the first room. I was told that the heat was going to work all night, and I had to believe that it would. Thankfully, we didn't have a lot of stuff to move. And even better, the heat actually did work all night. We also had quite a bit of noise from people running up and down the halls during the night-- I know that the hotel can't do much about that, but just an FYI for light sleepers. Also, there is some kind of construction going on right next door to the hotel, which is quite loud. Overall, the location of the hotel is great, and some of the amenities are very nice, too. However, you do expect that the heat in your hotel room will work, especially in Chicago in November! Also, I would have really liked if the hotel offered some kind of complimentary breakfast, even a continental breakfast would have been greatly appreciated. (There was a coffee maker in the room, but it was kind of odd, as it only brewed one cup of coffee at at ime?). I did fill out the hotel survey and got a very nice letter from the hotel management rep, but again, heat is just something you expect to come standard, not to have to pay extra to get.", "Date": "November 30, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "3", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Justin, Texas", "Title": "\u201cNice Hotel, Nice Location\u201d", "Author": "Enkadtaw", "ReviewID": "UR22266773", "Content": "Very nice hotel with exceptional service.

They also use low flow shower heads which is pretty funny because they have a \"massage\" setting that when you try to use it the water has such low flow it barely trickles out of the shower head. My biggest issue was finding a charge for the lounge located on the top floor on my bill at checkout time. We never did have time to visit the lounge (unfortunately) and when I explained this to them they actually acted like this was somehow my fault. This got me to wondering how often this \"mistake\" occurs at this hotel. The location is great but they stick you for about $50 a day for parking.

It is a great location, great staff who were mostly 30somethings, and refreshingly helpful and cheerful and know the value and meaning of customer service. We had a junior suite, it is quite roomy, funky decor. It was right beside the elevators, but you couldn't hear them or much else in the room except for traffic noise. Strangely, you could hear people talking, water running, etc. when you were in the bathroom, it was coming through the air vent. Due to the street noise factor mentioned by another reviewer, we asked for a high floor and were in 2201. Even up that high, you did get traffic noise, sirens at night. I am a light sleeper so always have ear plugs, which I used the first night (a Saturday). After that, I didn't need them, either it was much quieter the other nights or I was already used to the ambient noise. I would definitely stay here again on a return trip. They offer 3 \"kits\" to their guest, absolutely free, one is a Sports Kit, one a BYOB Kit and one a Walking Tour kit. The Walking Tour kit comes complete with IPod loaded with various walking tours and printed materials to guide you as well. We didn't have time to actually use the kit, but did listen to parts of the IPod tours, and they sounded fantastic. So be sure to check that kit out if you have time. The only negatives is the exorbitant parking rates (we did valet at $44 per night, to self-park up the street was $40 per night so may as well use valet). I thought Boston was bad at $25 per night. And there are no ice machines on the floors, so you have to order ice all the time from the front desk, meaning you have to tip someone every time you want ice. But the service was prompt and extremely polite and professional in all cases. Tips about Chicago-- we did Giordano's on Rush for our Chicago-style pizza experience, 2 blocks from hotel, and huge line-ups every night. They told us 1.5 hour wait when we arrived, and to pre-order our pizza after 40 minutes, which we did. We ended up getting our table in an hour, and the pizza was worth the wait. The Greek salad was unremarkable. Don't bother with the Elephant & Castle on St. Clair, one block form hotel. Inferior food and terrible service. Any Corner Bakery is great for a light breakfast, they have lunches as well but didn't try them. Fabulous Swiss oatmeal (like Birka's muesli if you know what that is) and blueberry muffins and good coffee. We walked all the way to and from The Greek Islands on Halsted, it is much further than it looked on the map! Greek food, short wait for a table, mousaka was good, as was a baked pasta (kind of Greek lasagna). Not a must do unless you are really into Greek food. For full breakfast if you feel like the trek north, try Kitsch 'n River North at the corner of Chicago and Larrabee. Reasonable prices, good home cooking, and funky 50s decor. For our one special dinner out, we splurged and went to Rosebud Steakhouse on Walton, 4 blocks north of hotel, as recommended by the Affinia concierge. It didn't disappoint. Great food, although expensive, wonderful service. The gumbo (soup of the day) was to die for. And the bread pudding was pretty amazing too. If you want to do the Architectural river cruise, book it through the Chicago History Museum web-site. Their tour is guided by an actual architect, is 1/2 hour longer that the other tours and you get free Starbucks coffee, cookies, muffins and cold beverages throughout. If you plan on doing anything that would appeal to families, try to be there when it first opens. Like the Shedd Aquarium -- we were there at 1 p.m. and left after an hour -- way too many people to enjoy the exhibits. We did Navy Pier right at 10 a.m. when it opened, almost nobody there. By 11 a.m., scads of busses arrive full of kids and tourists. If you want to get around within the city, get yourself a CTA system map that shows all the bus routes. The bus is much more convenient and efficient than the subway unless you're heading to the burbs, like for Frank Lloyd Wright, Wrigley Field, etc. Get yourself a Visitors Pass, it's great value, and you can pre-order it on-line, or pick up at various places around the city -- it tells you on the CTA system map. The Free Trolley system sounds good in principle -- people were jammed in like sardines every time we saw one, use your pass on the CTA for a much more comfortable and air-conditioned ride. The Wrigley Field tour is great, much better and twice as long as the one at Fenway. FLW home and studio was also great, if you're into him. Robie House was disappointing because it is under renovation and you don't get to see a lot of the inside. That isn't mentioned on the web-site, of course. Overall, Chicago is a beautiful city, flowers and greenery everywhere, clean, clean, clean.

When we first arrived in the room I actually thought the window was opened and we knew immediately that we would have problems with it.

As others have mentioned, the attitude and service of the Affinia staff are superlative. I pulled up in a taxi, and the concierge came out to open the cab door with a big \"Welcome\" to me. The hotel also has doormen, so I was impressed that the concierge did that. The check-in process was very pleasant and quick -- the person at the desk chatted with me for a while about the recent changes to the hotel. I had booked a junior suite; when I got to the room I realized that it bordered on the elevator shaft -- which is something I usually avoid in hotels. In trying to get my room changed, the staff told me that all junior suites are located next to the elevators. They offered to switch me to a different type of room, but I decided to give it a try and found that I could not hear the elevators at all while in the room. The room had a full-size bed, which was fine for one person but might be a squeeze with two trying to sleep there. There was a also a sleeper sofa in the room. The mattress was extremely comfortable. The beds are equipped with feather pillows, but there is also a choice of several other types of pillows if one wants them. These are mentioned in a card that was on the bed when I arrived. The bed had two small focused reading lights attached to it, along with two bedside lamps. One of the reading lights was missing its bulb. I reported it to the front desk the next morning, but this was never replaced during the next day I was there. One of the telephones in the room didn't work when I arrived. It was a cordless phone, and the other one in the room had a cord. I reported the broken phone at the desk the next morning, and that was fixed by the time I came back to the room in the afternoon. The decor in the room was excellent, and of course brand new. The only thing that didn't suit my taste was the orange foil wallpaper covering the bathroom walls. Paired with the round light that was backlighting the mirror, there were odd shadows thrown around when trying to look in the mirror. And, that was the only light in the room. Fortunately, for putting on makeup there was a little sitting area right outside the bathroom that had a small ceiling light and a lighted mirror. So, it all worked out well. The closet had a sensor light that came on most of the times when the door was opened. There was no light switch for it. I found that it turned off at odd times, if I was standing too still in front of it. And it didn't always come on when the door opened. It may have been defective, but I didn't report it. In the closet I found a white terry bathrobe, which is always a nice touch in a hotel room. It was very much appreciated. Others have mentioned the large flat-screen TV that swivels to face the bed or the seating areas in the room. This was one of the best features in the room. Unfortunately, the Channel button on the remote would stick a little when trying to move from one channel to another -- it wasn't a major problem, but I thought it was odd to find this defect in a recently-renovated hotel with such a new television in it. One more thing: the coffee maker had one-cup pods that would go into a cup. This is not my favorite way to have coffee, but it worked out fine. The main problem was that one of the provided cups was filthy one morning. Otherwise, all went well. There was a fully-stocked refrigerator with beverages, and a tray with chips and nuts on it in the room. Prices were posted. I did not try any of them. For those who have problems with stairs, there were three steps in the room. When first entering at the top level, there was a reading desk with telephone and lamp. Then one needed to go down three steps to get into the room itself. Not very many steps, but it might bother some people. One caveat for some, and it is beyond the hotel's control: There is a big construction project currently beginning right next to the hotel, directly to the east. There is going to be a new children's hospital built there as part of the Northwestern hospital system. I heard a little noise once during the day, but it doesn't appear that the construction project is really going very far yet. I expect in the next couple of years there might be a lot more noise next door. But, this shouldn't be a problem on evenings, nights, or weekends -- so for most visits I think it will be fine. And yes, there are ambulance noises related to the large hospital complex a block away. These did not really bother me at all, especially at night.", "Date": "June 15, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Edinburgh, Scotland", "Title": "\u201cVery Good - will great when refurb complete\u201d", "Author": "EdinburghScotsman", "ReviewID": "UR16590120", "Content": "Stayed at Affinia Chicago for 5 nights over Memorial Day weekend.

We couldn't have been happier with the perfect location...just 1 block from the magnificent mile and endless shopping possibilities. Renovations are still going on outside, so we missed the valet parking when we arrived due to trucks outside; however, there is a quite new parking garage right across the street which costs the same as valet parking. The room was beautifully decorated in contemporary design. The bathroom was super clean and new. The bed was delightfully comfortable the bed lights were convenient. My only 3 concerns about the Affinia were the following: 1. We went to a concert at United Center on Friday night and left the window in the room cracked for air. Upon returning, the room was filled with mosquitos due to no screens on the windows. I went the front desk who assigned us another room (quite nice, but got slightly mouthy with me even though it was the hotel problem not to have any screens.) When we arrived in the second room, there were mosquitos all along the window and on the ceiling also. The window was closed. Due to being in the early morning hours and frustrated we just spent 10 minutes killing them. I'm assuming this is an ongoing problem in the rooms and not necessarily because of me leaving the window open. We had no problems after that with the mosquitos...but the hotel definitely needs to invest in pest control of some sort of in purchasing screens so the guests can open up the windows especially in the warmer months. 2. The bar area/restaurant was not ready yet. The hotel on Expedia posted they have free cocktails everynight; however, there was no food or drinks anywhere in the lobby. Alot of other hotels have adjacent places to eat/drink, but with Affinia we had to go out to other places. Not that it is horrible, but not as convenient as listed. 3. The flatscreen tv was wonderful, especially how it swiveled. The tv is set up so you cannot change to any aux channels. If you bring a video game system or dvd player, you will not be able to hook up to the tv. Overall, the staff was great with directions, suggestions, and advice. Rooms were comfortable with chic/modern. Location definitely makes this hotel one I will return to without looking at other hotels. Once the renovation is complete, it will definitely appear like a 4.5 star hotel. Would definitely recommend for young couples; you will be so close to shopping, food, and bars.

We heard that the hotel had undergone a renovation and read great reviews. Unfamiliar with Chicago, we trusted the reviews, crossed our fingers and hoped for the best. We were not let down. Upon arrival, the lobby was still undergoing renovations and preparing for the opening of their restaurant. Our room was ready, so check in was smooth and easy. There are complimentary bottles of water and snacks for you at the front desk...great after a 10 hour flight or a long day of walking around the city. Daniel, the bellman, helped with our bags and gave us a brief rundown of places to go. Such a great guy, it was southern hospitality at it's best. The room we booked was a Jr. Suite and it was fabulous!! (take a look at photos) The layout was great and it was nice to be able to spread out and lounge. The Affinia has some cool services. They offer several pillow options to choose from, walking tours to download, exercise videos for the room, etc. All of the toiletries in the room are from Aveda. I'm a huge couch potato at home, so I appreciated the flat screen that could swivel to face the bed or the couch. Location off the Magnificent Mile was terrific. One block off the mile, the hotel is located behind Neiman Marcus. Around the corner was a 24-hour Walgreens. If you are visiting for a conference at McCormick Place the Affinia does not have a shuttle service but don't worry, there are several hotels next to the Affinia that you can catch. The hotel was very quiet and elevators were fast. Very clean, with comfy beds, water pressure in bath is perfect . I recommend the Jr. Suite; it's spacious enough that I could sleep without being bothered while my husband worked on his laptop. We were sad to leave at the end of the week but needed to get back home for Easter...but our plans changed. There was a freak snowstorm that hit on Friday and our flight back home was cancelled! We couldn't get back home until the night of Easter Sunday! I immediately got on the phone at the airport and called the Affinia. Spoke with Milton, the Front Desk Manager. He was so helpful and friendly during that stressful moment. He was able to get us checked back into another suite with an even better rate! When we got there, the staff was great to us and were so sorry that we wouldn't be able to get home for Easter. Thank you so much to everyone there. We fell in love with Chicago and will return during the summer. The city is beautiful, so much to do and see, but most of all the people were so wonderful.

The entrance to the hotel IS a mess - there is scaffolding, uneven sidewalks, mud, wet paint in the lobby, etc., but this really didn't make any difference to my husband or me. The only annoying thing about the construction was that we were forced to use two separate sets of slooow elevators every time we went to our room. Otherwise, the price and the newly remodeled rooms were definitely worth the cost of walking through a little construction in the entrance. The rooms are all updated with a very clean and stylish feel to them. We stayed in the studio suite, which was very spacious and very comfortable. The flat panel TV that swivels around from bedroom to living room definitely kept my husband entertained for a while. The view from our room - on the 19th floor I think - was a great view right down a street that runs parallel to Mich Ave. The fact that the restaurant and bar aren't open made no difference to us whatsoever. There are tons of restaurants extremely close nearby, and if you want room service, they provide all the rooms with a menu from a delivery service for area restaurants. Also, the lobby was always stocked with complimentary bottles of water and snacks. The location cannot be beat - it is about a block away from Michigan Ave, and about 1/2 a block to Neiman-Marcus and Sak's. It's literally right in the middle of everything. Also, every single employee of the hotel was extremely friendly and helpful. We are not the typical guests because we were in town visiting several friends, and often visit Chicago, so we didn't need as many recommendations about getting to Navy Pier, etc., but if you do need that information, they are very knowledgeable and willing to offer tips.

We really appreciated the makeup station outside the bathroom, it even came equipped with a makeup mirror, nice touch. The beds were comfortable and housekeeping was perfect. They changed our sheets every day and we had no problem getting enough towels! The hotel staff was exceptionally friendly. Every single one made us feel welcome and important.

I felt as if I was the only one staying here despite the fact that the lobby was busy and I knew differently. Construction. I have to admit that the lobby construction did not inconvenience me in the slightest. That being said, I do have some suggestions to how it might have been better presented. I would have temporarily painted the area out side the elevators going to the lobby. The walls looked dingy and unimpressive; not at all compatible with the rooms. I would also have installed temporary baseboards to give the hotel a more polished look, even if just for a short time. Also, I would never have posted signs on computer paper, writen in marker and affixed to the walls with tape; it looked tacky. Instead, I would have custom made temporary signs to indicate directions to the lobby. These signs are inexpensive, easy to obtain, and they would have looked much more professional than the hand made signage. Finally, I would suggest that doors be shut to unfinished areas. It looked shabby to walk by. If I wasn't a guest, and was taking a quick peek, I would not be inclined to book a room. Finally, I have some suggestions regarding the lack of restaurant and the no weclome drink which was promised. It is completely understandable that give the construction, the hotel could not offer its daily breakfast spread. I do feel that some attempt should have been made to counteract that inconvenience. Muffins and juice somewhere? Also, a welcome 1/2 bottle of wine would be nice with a letter apologizing for any inconvenience. The in room information is old and refers to a now non-existant pool. I would update that information AS SOON as the rooms were completed. I would not have allowed the rooms to be used until everything in the room was finished.

At the time of booking the Hotel, I requested a queen/queen room on a high floor. We arrived at about 10:45 AM, and a room was already ready. The room they gave us was on the 4th floor ( out of about 22 ) or so. I'm not sure if they had people staying in the upper floors because of the construction, but I have a suspicion that had we checked in at the regular time, a room matching our preferences may have been given to us. If true, it would have been nice to give us the option to check in early or leave our bags and come back in a few hours when a higher room was available. However, this is of no consequence as our room was lovely. Had we asked to be moved, we probably would have been accommodated anyways. We had a queen/queen room along the front side of the hotel facing south, and we had a great view straight down St. Clair street. Our room did not have the steps down into the living area like so many reviews on this site talk about, which was a little disappointing, but the view made up for it. I'm not sure if only suites have the dual level rooms or what, but don't get your hopes up like I did and expect this, because not every room has this feature. The room decor was contemporary with the dark floors and furniture contrasting with the white linens and walls with orange and green bed accents. It had nice 32\" (?) LCD flat screen TV, as well as a reading chair, a desk with another rolling chair, and a separate cabinet with a mini fridge. The small window on the far left actually cranked open, which we enjoyed. However, we noticed that the window frames and caulk were definitely not part of the renovation as they were slightly disgusting. The bathroom was stunning! The red wallpaper was crazy, and there was a HUGE walk-in shower. The mirror with the circle of light surrounding was cool as well. Inside were Aveda products (which housekeeping did not restock for day 2) and a pair of dimming lights: one above the shower and one in the toilet area. In the closet was a couple of robes, an iron and board, and a safe, all of which we did not use. There was also an automatic motion sensor light that turned on when you walked past and the doors were closed, which was a neat feature. The staff was very friendly and helpful, but I don't feel like they lived up to the reputation from previous reviews. We had to carry our own bags up to our room because the doorman / bellman completely overlooked us as we arrived. Both doormen were pleasant, but neither greeted us by name like in other reviews. One did hail a cab for us with his whistle on the way out, which we got a kick out of. I don't think the bellman talked to us once our entire stay. The front desk was helpful, and one gentleman even printed a March Madness bracket off for me, but sometimes when we came back in, they wouldn't even say hello. For the last part of our trip, we stayed at the Hotel Monaco, and our experiences with the staff there offered a stark contrast. Not to say that the Affinia crew was bad because they were great, but they just didn't go that extra mile. This is something they should strive towards. One thing I must comment on is the pillow menu. Try the sound pillow, which connects to an MP3 player to softly lull you to sleep. We also tried the magnetic pillow, which I did not enjoy. We knew about the ongoing construction going into our stay, and for the price we paid, it was definitely NOT an issue.

We fell in love with the hotel--don't know if we'll be able to afford to stay here once the renovations are complete, so I'm glad that we chose it for this trip. The staff is wonderful. They were always friendly and concerned that we had everything we needed. If you had any questions, they were always helpful. The front lobby was still under construction, but no worries. They supplied bottled water and snacks because the restaurant is not yet finished. We didn't have to change elevators, as others mentioned, so that part of the renovation must be done. The room was terrific. When I booked it, I was told it was a junior suite--it was huge! An \"office area\" with a desk was located just inside the door. A few steps down from that was a large sitting area, with a couch, chair, refrigerator that was hidden inside a cabinet and a large tv that was swivelled so that you could either turn it towards the sitting area or the bed area. The king bed was soooo inviting and comfortable, with lamps on either side of the headboard. You could order several different kinds of pillows, including magnetic pillows and ones that would hook up to your i-Pod so that you could listen to music through your pillow. The couch pulled out for sleeping, but my daughter and I camped out on the king-sized bed since my husband couldn't make the trip with us. Therefore, I can't vouch for the comfort of the pull-out couch. The bathroom was small, but very comfortable. And the room just off the bathroom contained a lighted magnifying mirror. There was an ironing board and iron in the closet, along with a hair dryer and bathrobes. The closet also contained a safe. Every room was spotless. Our room was located next to the elevator, and you could hear it when you were in the bathroom. But we weren't bothered by it during the night. In fact, it was very quiet in the room we stayed in. We didn't hear any others coming or going. But the best part of the room were the windows, which ran along the entire wall of the room! We looked out onto N. St. Clair Street from the 21st floor. It was beautiful at night. The hotel is just a block from Michigan Avenue and an easy walk to lots of places to eat and shop. My daughter went to the Elephant and Castle Pub for a drink one night, so I was surprised when the hotel gave us a voucher to go there for breakfast. The menu was small, but the food was good. And I'll be back there for a drink the next time I'm in town. All in all, we had a great stay.

Everyone bent over backwards to make sure we had a great visit. They greeted us by name and asked if we needed anything everytime they saw us. We asked for ice, (there is no vending right now) and it was literally in our room in 2 minutes. The young lady at the front desk, whom we saw everyday, was extremely sweet and helpful.

It was only a minor detraction - the lobby was torn up and the elveators were under maintenance requiring guests to transfer to a different elevator if they were going higher than the 7th floor. The great discount was worth the construction hassle. We requested a room on a high floor when we reserved and again when we checked in and were told no guests were staying above the eighth floor. This was puzzling and bothersome as all week we saw people staying on the 12th, 19th and 25th floors - and ended up on the 10th floor ourselves. Our first room was on the 8th floor - a Studio Suite looking out at the Hancock building and a couple other skyscrapers. There was a section of roof right outside our window with gigantic generators that were unsightly...but seemed quiet enough at the time so we didn't worry too much about it. There was a construction office directly next to us which we also weren't too concerned about. The room was cold and after blasting the heat all night never warmed up. The thermostat said 75 but it was no warmer than the mid 60s. Our room was also lacking a refrigerator and the remote control didn't work. After waking up freezing the next morning to the sound of a 7am buzz saw from the construction office next door, we asked if we could move to another room. We ended up a couple doors down where we had the pleasure of a refrigerator and heat. This room was very similar but the added ammenities helped - even tho there was no view whatsoever this time - excpet the same generators we were facing last time without the hancock. We were happy...until we took an afternoon nap. Unfortunately...the generator outside our window kicked on as we laid down and was very loud to the point ear plugs and pillows over the head wouldn't deafen it. So we moved again...to the 10th floor. Finally, we had heat, a fridge, a remote, and quiet. The hotel uses a 3rd party internet provider that was a pain to get set up. After paying i lost my connection and couldn't get it back and had to call the 1 800 number. After the first night it worked perfectly for the next 3. They also use a 3rd party valet (with geno's?) and when we checked out it took nearly a half hour to get our car. The parking was free with the promotion...but it still took forever. So that was somewhat of a nightmare...we travel a lot and rarely switch rooms, and have never switched twice. There is a reason we request high floors and had we been put on a higher floor initially our stay would have probably been perfect. On to the positives... With the exception of the \"8th floor\" debacle, The desk staff and bellmen at the Affinia are top notch. They could not have been friendlier and more accommodationg. They were understanding throughout our moves and apologetic. The bellmen were friendly and prompt. I can't say enough about the staff. Secondly, the rooms themselves are really great. The studio suites are big and comfortable. Very modern ammenities and fixtures, very clean and spacious. We were very comfortable and satisfied with the room itself. Finally...the location is perfect. If you're looking for the Michigan Ave experience, the Affinia is perfect. So, in the end we just wish we could have been on a higher floor like we requested and still don't understand the double standard. The hotel and staff is really great and the rooms are wonderful.

The TV is conveniently located in the middle of the room and can be turned either towards the couch or bed. The bathroom amenities were very nice Aveda products, and soft, plush towels.

We called down, and they explained how to restart the furnace. Well, it was pretty obvious why it was not working, it was absolutely disgusting!! I do not think the filter has been changed in this century. Waking up freezing during the night to restart a furnace is in no way a plus. This hotel is also located next door to Northwestern hospital. The constant ambulance noise even on the 14 th floor, when not waking me up, had me dreaming I was in lots of accidents.

The room did not even have a mini bar, so there was no food available and the only drink available was a complimentary botle of mineral water in reception. This is not, by anyone's definition, a hotel. I question whether the \"hotel\" should be open when its facilites are so bare and so much work is being carried on.

The room's air conditioning is very noisy - too noisy to have on at night (which meant that the inside of the window was frozen over in the morning!).

We checked out after just one night, and moved to the InterContinental, to enjoy the normal facilities one would associate with a hotel. A most unsatisfactory situation, all in all. Guests will undoubtedly have a better time when the hotel facilities reopen later in 2008. Anyone planning to stay at the Affinia before then should recognise that the only facility consists of their room, and is advised to check with the hotel directly to see what facilities are, or are not, on offer. But I for one won't be going anywhere near the Affinia Chicago, or any Affinia hotel, again. And I'll be very wary when booking through a 3rd-party web-site, as clearly the information can be very inaccurate (and there is no recompense or help when things go wrong).", "Date": "January 30, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "minnesota", "Title": "\u201cWhere \"At Your Service\" is more than a slogan!\u201d", "Author": "Myinspiration", "ReviewID": "UR13082188", "Content": "From the moment that we arrived (at 6 a.m. and after a long COLD evening of travel), we were greeted and treated like royalty from the desk manager, Milton, and staff.

Booking on AAA for three weeknights (Dec. 26th - 29th) secured a room for a mere $108 per night (plus applicable taxes). Given the location and quality of the hotel, I was flabbergasted at my good fortune. The Affinia is located on Superior and St. Clair, a half block east of the Magnificent Mile, two blocks south of Water Tower Place and the Hancock Center, and approximately 4 and a half blocks from the red line subway stop at Chicago station (making trips from O'Hare -blue line - or Midway - orange line - very reasonable via public transportation. You can even order CTA passes ahead of time via the internet!). The Affinia staff is always ready and willing to help you secure ground transportation if you need a taxi or information regarding airport shuttle services (not directly provided by the hotel, but they can point you in the right direction). The staff bends over backwards to be welcoming and helpful. To illustrate further: One morning we decided to do a subway/Metra train combination to reach the Science and Industry Museum instead of the #10 bus (probably would have been more convenient, but I digress...) I did not have a Metra schedule with me and in the interest of getting away from work had not brought my laptop on the trip. The desk clerk (in the newly remodeled lobby - just completed during our stay!) pulled up a Metra schedule online and assisted us in catching the right train. Wonderful! Although the renovation is ongoing (the restaurant is next), it did not interfere with our stay. The rooms are all completed and an obvious upgrade in decor is evident. The bed is extraordinarily comfortable, and you can customize your pillow selection simply by calling hotel services. Flat screen LCD TV, fridge, digital combo safe, etc. in our room. Complimentary Aveda products in the bathroom and guest robes in the closet. Four-star amenities at a three-star price. The only issues we experienced... batteries in the remote control died (how picky am I??) - issue was fixed in less than 5 minutes after a call to the front desk. No mirror outside of the bathroom was a minor inconvenience. Also, the room renovation was a bit too evident behind one of the wall panels (the oldest and dirtiest Trane furnace ever made) and a loose panel under the sink in the bathroom. That being said (and again, I'm almost sorry to be that picky), this was the BEST hotel experience I've had in years and was within walking distance to almost everything we wanted to do in the River North / Mag. Mile area (Pops Jazz Club, the Signature Room, etc.) Only disappointment in the immediate area was Gino's East (right next door). Skip it during peak hours (definitely not worth waiting around the corner for). Call ahead and get the deep dish experience in your room - I think you'll be glad you did.

We found an inexpensive rate online and decided to go for it. I did understand that the hotel was under renovation, however, I was not prepared for what we saw when we arrived. The lobby (if you can call it that) is dismal and cramped and you must squeeze past the desk to get to the elevator. The hotel staff leaves much to be desired. They seemed to lack the confidence to even give directions or answer a simple question. We asked them about restaurants, directions, sight-seeing...basically the typical things you would assume the \"consierge\" would be able to help you with...but to no avail. We were answered with a \"deer in headlights\" look. One of the bellman (whom I won't name) was actually a little creepy. When I checked into the hotel he wouldn't get out of the room. He brought the bags in one by one, very slowly. He stayed for about 15 minutes talking to me about nonsense and asking me personal questions. It was very uncomfortable. While we were there for the weekend the elevator went out twice and no one seemed to know what to do or who to call. Luckily we were only on the 4th floor. The stairwell, however, looked like something in a horror film...filty, with grafitti and nasty drawings. There was a letter in the room that apologized for the construction and assured us that it would strictly be from 8am-4:30 pm, however, you can here the sound of hammers and power tools bright and early at 7 am...maybe 6:45 am if you're lucky. When we were ready to check out, the staff almost charged us with another family's room & charged our room & parking to the wrong credit card. Overall, the experience was lackluster.

We'd never been to Chicago before and we wanted a hotel that was right in the middle of the action. The Affinia's location is FANTASTIC! Right off Michigan Ave. (the Magnificent Mile as they call it) and within walking distance to so many things. We walked the majority of our trip and only took cabs late at night or to locations that were far away from where we stayed. They are doing construction at the Affinia which affects the look of the hotel on the outside as well as the lobby area (it is crammed right now) but other than that, the construction was NO bother. We never heard or saw anything. Our room had just been renovated and it was really cute. The beds and pillows are extremely comfortable!! We slept peacefully. The rooms are clean and have all the basics, including a mini fridge at no extra charge. The staff was fantastic. All of the bell hops (forgive me if that's not the right term!) were extremely friendly and helpful. They gave us directions, restaurant recommendations and were always around to hold the door for us and hail us a cab. The women who ran the front desk were just as lovely. They made all of our reservations for us, helped us find a boat tour, called places to get info and pricing, etc. They were always very eager to help and I thoroughly enjoyed talking to everyone who works at this hotel. I won't even get started on rating Chicago - it is an AMAZING city. A million things to do and it's just gorgeous! I highly recommend walking along lake Michigan in the early morning (weather permitting) as it's just beautiful. My sister and I got up at 6am just to go walking and watch the sunrise, it is only 2 blocks from the Affinia! All in all, the hotel was great. It was expensive but all hotels in that area of Chicago are. I'm sure once the renovations are finished, it will be just perfect. I highly recommend!

We were shown to our room on the 12th floor and shortly thereafter, given a call to see how we liked our room. There was a desk blocking one of the closet doors from opening which we thought sort of odd as they had just remodeled (maybe they will rethink the size of desk for that room?) Also I had asked for a room with a view, but the view was not all that great from this room. We were promptly moved to another room on the 14th floor with a better view (facing Superior St.) and full access to the closet. We soon found out the air conditioning was not working and the safe would not open. An engineer promptly came to fix both those problems and we had no more incidents the rest of the stay. The staff were very friendly and willing to help with reservations to restaurants or tours or shows. They didn't seem to have a separate concierge....the person that checked you in and out also helped with all of that. They had free bottled water and snacks available at the checkin desk. I must mention only one elevator was working and it was quite hot in the hallways and in the elevator(due to renovations being done I'm told). I was a little worried I might freak out if the elevator got stuck with a full load of people on it and the heat in there, but that never happened. The beds were super comfortable, but I am used to a softer pillow. I had read about the pillow menu and asked about trying a different pillow, but that is not available yet. We heard lots of sirens from the room and may have had a problem sleeping, but my husband had gotten a box fan from someone when the air conditioning wasn't working and we used that to drown out the outside noise which worked quite well. The bathroom was very clean and okay. It had a makeup mirror on a little counter, but no chair to sit in to be at the level to use it. Pretty much a standard bathroom, nothing fancy. The hotel renovations are not expected to be done until sometime in February 2008. I expect it will be better then and all the elevators should be working. Although I question some of the remodeling and how long it will stay nice. In our room we noticed a crooked plug in the bathroom and loose faucet handle in the shower. The caulking showed some wear for it being brand new. Surely hope not alot of stuff is being \"jimmy-rigged\". Overall, we were very comfortable and I am pretty picky about having nice surroundings on vacation. The maid did a fantastic job of cleaning the room and left us wine glasses for us to have a glass of wine. I must mention in our room upon entry there was a huge beautiful mirror on the wall and another huge long mirror on another wall (mirrors do help make a place feel roomier). Upon checkout, the doorman hailed us a cab ( I think he had to go to Michigan Ave. to get one....) The cabbie was supposed to take us to Union Station to catch the Amtrak train home, but dropped us off 3 blocks away which we didn't realize until we were standing there with our luggage. We had to walk 3 blocks hauling all of our luggage with us. The look on my husband's face was not good.....we were both breathing hard and sweating by time we got there. So if going to Union Station, make sure your great Chicago cabbie has you in front of Union Station on the right side to enter to your train before you let him go. The last time we left Chicago from the Talbott hotel we had our two grandkids with us. The cabbie dropped us off at Union station upon which an Amtrak porter was waiting to take us and all of our bags straight to our train. That was wonderful! Overall the stay was comfortable and the price was good. I would probably stay again, maybe after the renovations are complete and all of the elevators are working again.

Thanks to the staff at the Affinia, I can give them FIVE STARS. We stayed just this past weekend, Friday June 8-10. Checklist: Early check in request: accommodated Late check out: accommodated Two rooms close together: accommodated Store luggage after check out: accommodated Information about area attractions: accommodated Extra service to room: accommodated speedily Friendliness of all staff: accommodated ***** From the time the Affinia was assigned to us by Priceline, I had been nervous -- not because I knew anything of the Affinia personally but quite the contrary -- I'd never been to the Chicago or the older hotel being renovated; tripadvisor.com reviews; etc. No facility is going to be perfect regardless of whether it is newly-built, newly-renovated, well maintained -- nothing is going to be 100% perfect. While the newly-renovated rooms assigned to my party (two rooms) were well appointed, very nicely done (in my opinion) and the bed was so comfortable, I simply did not want to get up, what makes a stay perfect is the friendliness and willingness of a staff who will treat each and every patron as if they are happy to see you; happy to assist in any way possible, and the little touches that don't seem to be important but sure are noticed when done for you. My sister, niece, her two children and my step-daughter to be certainly experienced the exquisite care of the Affinia staff. From the bell staff , front office staff, and chef to the general manager, we couldn't have been treated better! After having mentioning the fact that we were going to be in Chicago to celebrate the birthdays of our three young girls at the American Girl Place, the Affinia staff went ABOVE and BEYOND to make sure our girls were treat especially well -- and even their dolls. They were so happy, and you know how that affects us adults!! Quentin, especially, and Daniel the bell staff treated us well, and remembered the girls' names; front desk staff were very helpful; Mr. Foley (front office manager) introduced himself upon check in. Chef Bell went over the top with her tasty design -- so much so, the girls wanted to save them and take them home, they were so pretty! The housekeeping staff with beds turned down, water at our bedsides -- touches that go a long way after a long day of being out on the town. My room was perfectly comfortable regarding air conditioning, while my niece\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s room set at the same temp was quite a bit warmer -- maintenance came in, fixed the problem, and we were left a message to that effect and if there were any problems, to please let the front desk know. Could there still be improvements? Sure \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the normal stuff: more water pressure for the shower, vents in bathroom so not so steam -- one light not working on headboard lamp (which are very nice, by the way) ... but these things will be noted, fixed, improved, I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m sure. While attention to outward appearances, maintenance and cleanliness of the facility are important to any property, more important than whether a mirror is at a proper height, the decor is not current or quality toiletries are supplied (all of which were not an issue at the Affinia as far as I could tell) are staff courteousness, attentiveness, eagerness -- these things are definitely present at the Affinia. MOST IMPORTANTLY: This shows that reviews are read, guests' comments are taken seriously and the Affinia is striving to take into consideration the needs as well as the desires of its guests. As long as it continues to care what guests are saying and staff are making us feel at home, I am sold on the Affinia! It is close to everything you want to experience while in Chicago, just one block east of Michigan Avenue (Magnificent Mile). When I'm in Chicago again, I'll be back to stay at the Affinia. My Advice: Book a stay at the Affinia if you find yourself heading to Chicago. If you've been reading past tripadvisor.com reviews, I know you will be overwhelmingly surprised by the changes taking place -- not just in the facilities themselves, but the transformation of the staff (at least based on past reviews). Thanks to all of the Staff at the AFFINIA CHICAGO for making our stay one that makes us ready to visit Chicago again soon!!

When I saw that the Fitzpatrick was being converted to an Affinia I was excited, as we often travel to Chicago, our former home.

After checking into our suite we noticed that the heat wasn't working. In fact, cold air was being blown out. When we left to go shopping I notified the front desk of the problem. They said that it would be fixed right away. Fast forward 2.5 hours. I came back from shopping and went up to my room, only to find that the \"heater\" was still blowing cold air. I went down to the front desk and was told that it would be fixed right away. The front desk appeared put out by my request. I killed some time in the Irish bar in the basement (which is great) and went up to the room an hour later. The heat was finally fixed. The next morning I was awaken by the sound of dripping in the bathroom. I went to check and noticed that the ceiling was leaking. Our entire counter was soaked, along with all of our towels and toiletries. I called down and they had someone come up to fix the problem. At the time of checkout there were no apologies for the inconveniences that we had to deal with. If I weren't a laid back person I probably would have been pretty upset. Later I sent an email to the management just to let them know of our dissatisfaction. I received a response several days later saying, essentially, sorry.

But all that work is being done in areas other than the lobby and guestrooms. I stayed one night, April 11. The reception staff was pleasant, but the doormen were apathetic and uninterested. In fact, I was not even sure they were hotel employees by their attitude or attire. I did not see them greet anyone. I did not see them rushing to help with luggage or cabs. Of course, I didn't see many other guests when I was there. I would not say anyone went out of their way to make me feel welcome. There was NO food service in the hotel. Even the pub/lounge was closed. I saw very few other guests and almost felt like I had the hotel to myself. My room, though large, and with the same decor as the last time I was there at the Fitzpatrick, was a little worse for the wear. It is as if the guestrooms have been let slide a little while attention is elsewhere in the project. On the positive side, Gino's East Pizza has returned to their former location next to the hotel.

I traveled with my father who is in a wheelchair and his caregiver. While we couldn't get rooms right next to eachother, (partially because the room across from his room was one of the penthouse suites,) they were able to put me in a room that was just one floor beneath. To make up for us not having rooms next to eachother, they gave me what I have to think is one of the best views you can find in downtown Chicago. You can see all the way down to Prudential II, not to mention the lovely buildings in the immediate area. I'll start with my room: the bed was unbelieveable, one of the most comfortable beds I've ever slept in in my life. There was a nice reading light in the massively vaulted ceiling above the bed with controls just next to the bed. The bathroom was fantastic. Beautiful granite counters with nice fixtures and a lovely hanging wall mirror. Aveda products. The shower, however, was my favorite part. It was HUGE, great pressure - really, really a pleasure. The brookstone cd player/stereo system was a nice touch. Now for the \"handicapped accessible\" room: While the handicapped accessible room itself was rather nice and the bathroom was very convenient and nicely decorated, getting to it was very difficult. There is, apparently, only one handicapped accessible room in the entire hotel. It's not placed very well, either. It's on the penthouse floor of the building, and in order to reach pretty much all the suites on the floor from the normal elevator, you must climb STAIRS. I don't know who the genius was who thought \"hey, why don't we put the handicapped accessible room there?\" But it doesnt seem like a very good move to me. So, in order for wheelchair bound guests to reach the room, they must go up the normal elevator to the seventh floor, walk through the kitchen and take the FREIGHT/ROOM SERVICE/GARBAGE elevator up to the room! I might mention that this elevator is.. well.. disgusting, worn down and smells horrible, and the elevator moves very, very slowly. Also, when garbage is being loaded, the staff has a tendancy to stop the elevator on whatever floor they're loading/unloading onto, so at bad times, it can take AGES for the elevator to come. Again, the room was nice, but the way to get to the room is probably the worst design for a disabled person POSSIBLE. Now, despite that, the staff, the fact that the rooms were so comfortable and the excellent location actually made the stay rather nice. Until a couple weeks later. My major warning about this hotel: DO NOT TRUST THE VALET!!! A few weeks after my stay at the affinia, I recieved a $90 parking ticket in the mail from the night I checked in, about an hour after I had given my car to the valet. Apparently, it had been parked in a taxi stand in front of the merchantile exchange, which is pretty much nowhere near the hotel. What the valet was doing with my car parking it in a taxi stand a ways away from the hotel, I do not know. The valet prices alone are already pretty outrageous, and then a $90 ticket on top of it? Come on. I've tried to contact the hotel's manager numerous times since I recieved that ticket and have recieved absolutely no response whatsoever.

Great location right off of miracle mile, near all major hotels, best shopping and theatres. Rooms very large. Hotel staff very friendly and helpful, and respond immediately. Problems: there frequently are homeless people (even during daylight) on Superior between St. Clair and Michigan Avenue (the main route you walk for or all activities, and just about everything is in walking distance from here). At night, the street on the north side of Superior is dark, and it usually smells strongly of several unpleasant odors. The street people do not approach you, although they may stare as you go by. Usually 2 or more along the way, where they sleep on the window sills of Neiman Marcus. I would not think a woman would feel safe by herself. (I am from a large city and do not have a street people phobia.) There are homeless up and down Michigan Street, but this is different as it's a lonely stretch and no open business is along either side of the street. The entire hotel needs a lot of cosmetic work, and apparently will soon undergo a major renovation. For now, expect two extremely small, warm, slow elevators with long waits serving 17 floors and warm, cramped hallways! All the walls throughout the hotel need painting, and the wallpaper is peeling in places. In the room, several electrical outlets were hanging out of the connection, the carpets were stained, the bathrooms needed new grout (some mold visible), the TV is very small (16 Inch?) and the windows very, very dirty. You won't get your room serviced unless you ask for it, sometimes more than once. The \"pub \" downstairs is run down, dark and kind of creepy. Food and room service are very expensive, as is parking ($34/day public and $38/day valet).

There is a small fridge and tea/coffee making facilities. The bathroom while not particularly large was clean, well laid out and had a decent shower. Room service was quick and the food very good. There are no ice machines but room service bring the ice up very quickly which was fine. The staff were very helpful and friendly, particularly Daniel the doorman. Fitzers, the Irish bar in the basement, sells a decent pint of Guinness :-) We had only one problem, it was quite a large problem and was the first thing that happened to us when we arrived - not a good introduction.

Also, how can you not have grape or strawberry jam? Orange marmelade and raspberry jam might be okay for adults, but not my kids!! The other issue was the way the room was set up. We selected a Queen suite. The virtual tour online is somewhat deceiving. On the web it looks as though the bedroom area is separate from the living room, but beware, it is all one room. If you want any privacy, don't go that route. I saw someone else's post on Trip Advisor, but took the virtual tour and thought that person was just picky. Believe me, she was right!

This hotel is 4 blocks from the Chicago Red Line CTA stop, walk 1 block south from Chicago to Superior, then 3 blocks east.

We liked breakfast at the Water Tower Center (2nd floor food court) two blocks north: full hot selection, fresh sticky buns in the pan, greatest strawberries, about $6 each, quick-easy-good. The Fitz is closer to the lake shore than any hotel we saw. Reach the boardwalk (across Lake Shore Drive) via pedestrian underpass near Chicago St. (1 block north).

Half the lamps in our room did not work.", "Date": "May 21, 2004"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "4.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Herne Bay, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cWell satisfied with the Fitzpatrick\u201d", "Author": "Le_Dap", "ReviewID": "UR2081931", "Content": "The Fitzpatrick is a very good hotel in a very good location. It deserves most of the accolades showered upon it by other reviewers. We stayed for five nights with friends in two one-bedroom suites on the eighth floor. We were slightly disappointed with our room compared to theirs. Ours was at the back of the hotel looking onto some quite noisy extractor fans and the carpet was somewhat soiled in places. The remote keyboard for internet access didn't work because the batteries were flat and the CD player wouldn't function. In contrast, our friends had a better view from the front of the hotel, more sensibly placed furniture and cleaner carpets. On the plus side, our bed was one of the most comfortable we have slept in, reception staff were wonderfully friendly and helpful, the breakfast buffet was excellent, Fitzers pub in the basement was comfortable and served tasty pub grub, and the location near the John Hancock building would be difficult to beat (dinner on the 95th floor of the Hancock was excellent but pricey and nearby Spiaggia served the best G&Ts of our US tour).

From the moment we arrived in the foyer of the Hotel we knew we had made the right choice. (Based on research through trip advisor). The Suite itself had \"wow\" factor,the minute you opened the door. It was clean, fresh, quiet, well appointed and spacious beyond our expectations. We even had a direct view of the Hancock building and a bit of lake Michigan. The staff were genuinely friendly,helpful and attentive and any faults(very minor) were dealt with immediately and without quibble. Breakfast at the hotel was plentiful and good value. The location was perfect for us,near the water tower and at the top end of Michigan Avenue where you could wander around quite safely night and day. My wife and I are experienced travellers and travel regularly to North America where we consider the hotels to be far superior to those in the U.K - But without a doubt this is the best we've stayed In and only wish it were the benchmark for all hotels. My only regret !, I didn't take home the complementary bath robe and slippers you find in the room when you arrive?

My wife and I are very demanding consumers and this was one of our best hotel experiences yet. We paid $109/nt plus taxes through Travelocity for room 1502 (the smallest room type).Here's what we liked: - Room design (unique layout with steps leading to the bed area, great intimate lighting) - Location (near the midpoint of the Magnificent Mile - the premium Chicago shopping district with a good italian restaurant and Benihana's downstairs) - Room view (all the rooms on the south side face down N St. Clair St, giving you a view 6 blocks long) - Full breakfast offered pancackes, sausages, scrambled eggs, muffins, danish, bacon, fresh fruit, cereals, coffee/tea, OJ, bagels, yogurt in a civilized dining room for $9.95/person (for cheaper options go to the McD's at the Chicago Place food court at the corner) - Other great things; staff, furnishings, window/bed treatments, bed linens, 3 internet jacks plus free MSNBC access via the LodgeNet TV, and a mini fridge that you can actually use.Slight room for improvement: - Bed was a little soft for my back (they use thick pillow-top mattresses, maybe I'm not used to this) - TV was a little small (19\"?) - No Vending machines (go to the bar downstairs or around the corner to Walgreens) - Valet parking is $32/day with in/out privs (you can self-park for less at 3 places on Chicago Ave for $20-26/day)FYI...Chicago tourist highlights: - The Chicago Architectural Foundation walking tours (http://www.architecture.org/) - The Hancock Observatory (94th floor, definitely splurge for the audio tour, for a cheaper experience order a drink at the lounge on 96) - The Marshall Fields flagship store (an amazing renovation, you could spend a whole day here, free audio tours)", "Date": "April 13, 2004"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "5.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "UK", "Title": "\u201cGreat hotel for Central Chicago\u201d", "Author": "Wideeyedandlegless", "ReviewID": "UR1765874", "Content": "Have stayed at this hotel on several occasions and have never failed to be anything but delighted.

It's like a second home to me, and since my first stay, I am frankly afraid to book with another hotel downtown. The service, the suites (I have only stayed in suites), and the extras.. such as the cd player,robes... were all great. It's the only hotel I know of that has not only a reasonably-priced, but also delicious room service menu, as well as the menus in the restaurants... including a good breakfast buffet. The only complaints I have ever had are... 1) A very small wading pool, 2) Ice delivery verses machines on every floor, and 3) small bathrooms in the suites. Although there could be improvements, I suspect that these lesser features add up to the great price. If you look, the Fitz has the largest, most elegantly understated, comfortable, and fair priced suites on Michigan Ave. I know I will never stay elsewhere in downtown Chicago.

The room was actually a small suite with a fridge and wet bar, two TV's, a CD player, trouser press, bathrobes and even an umbrella. The bathroom was really nicely appointed and spotless. Position of the hotel is in our opinion perfect for a tourist visiting Chicago and the staff are extremely helpful and friendly. We booked through Expedia which worked perfectly, but the same rates were also available through their own website fitzpatrickhotels.com. Our flight to Chicago was delayed by storms and by the time we arrived at the hotel we were tired, hungry and fed up.
