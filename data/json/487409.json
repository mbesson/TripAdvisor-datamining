Both the bathroom and bedroom were good sizes by Paris standards. The decor was excellent, warm and welcoming. The hotel is well positioned for access to the Opera area. There are many restaurants within a two or three block radius. This is a two star hotel so there are limited amenities in the rooms; no fridge, only one english langauage channel on the tv (repeating the same programming every day). This was not an issue for us as we were there only to rest and sleep. The man in the little bar next door sold us water each evening and we returned the glass bottles the next morning. It worked for us. A couple of minor issues I noted. The bathroom tiles in the shower area are getting decidely tatty and need the grout cleaning or replacing to remove mould. At night we had to keep the bathroom door closed as we could clearly hear people arguing in another room through the air/steam vent. Most staff were excellent although one had little knowledge of tourist info.

Spacious closet with a safe and a flat screen tv. The only downside is location - the Mogador is cheaper from most Parisian hotels because it's relatively isolated from any major spots and easy to get lost near.

It's a good 15 minute walk to the Opera House which is the nearest major site with tour bus pick up/easy access to other sites.

The rooms are what you expect from Paris: some 10 contorted square meters (estimated), including bathroom. While the bathroom was quite modernly styled and in perfect condition (positive surprise), the rest of the room was in some kind of mediterranean style but also very clean. This is with the exception of the bed sheets, which had some ugly stains. The matresses were not comfortabel, you could feel the springs. There is heating in the room and a controller for the - non-existent - AC. In July, it gets rather hot and humid in the room if you do not open the window. Ours looked into a very ugly small court. The reception guys are friendly but not overly eager to help. Nobody offered to bring the luggage to the third floor (no lift!), our promised wake up call never happened (thank God for smartphones) and to get a taxi in the morning proved to be impossible for the concierge. Considering it is Paris, the value for money (we paid 89\u20ac plus tax per night), might still be acceptable.

The rooms are small (some of them smaller than others) but not too small and even though the hotel is located at a quiet street we were happy to have rooms to the backyard. These rooms probably also get less hot in the summer time (no regular airconditioning, but in the closets there were either ventilators or air conditionings for hotter days, also no mini bar/fridge in the rooms). The only noise comes from inside the hotel. Walls are really thin. Accordingly I recommend earplugs for those with a light sleep. The rooms are quite clean (even though they should dust the cushions on the wall above the bed as well as the old mirrors). When I read the feedback at tripadvisor that one of the guests felt attacked by a toilet role holder, I was wondering how this could be a problem for anyone.

Good location, close by Boulevard Hausmann shops but far enough to be in quiet street. Most friendly and helpful staff on all counts. Still not that cheap, but I guess that this is Paris and it was peak time.

We looked for a budget hotel, but most of the really cheap hotels (< 80 Euro/ room) didn't seem very \"reliable\" (much nicer pictures than reality, so to speak). Some hotels didn't even reply to my reservation e-mail. This hotel was just above our budget, but it was worth it. My e-mails were replyed within 24 hours (in good english). On arrial there was no long check-in procedure. The room was nice and clean. The hotel seemed recently renovated. The breakfast area was very simple though, but when in Paris, there's plenty other places to go. Staff was also very friendly with 24/7 occupation of the front-desk. Good central, but quiet location with a metrostation within a 5-10 min walk. Loved it.

The plus side is that Hotel Saint-Louis Opera is conveniently located near Metro stops and is within walking distance of Montmartre; also, the room was exceptionally clean and of a decent size. But we didn't like lugging our bags up three flights of narrow stairs, which proved to be the only way to get to upper floors (even if fire is unlikely, I don't like the absence of a secondary egress). Our hotel room windows opened into a light shaft shared in common with adjoining buildings, limiting our privacy and from which we could smell somebody's evening meal being cooked. Also, while we were there, the toilet off the lobby backed up and the smell of sewer gas lingered, causing us to go out for our breakfast rather than eat in at the hotel's small dining area. At 105 Euros per night during the off-season I don't think we got our money's worth and will look elsewhere when next visiting Paris.", "Date": "October 25, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "2", "Service": "3", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "London", "Title": "\u201cCould be better, could be worse\u201d", "Author": "Seetheworld2007", "ReviewID": "UR5233657", "Content": "This hotel wasn't bad and I am sure there are worse hotels in Paris but I felt it could have been a little bit cheaper.

The bads: the noise factor - my room was on the first floor and I could hear everyone go up and down the wooden stairs speaking rather loudly; room was very hot at night as the fan didn't work and I didn't want to leave window open at night when windows in the adjacent building had bars a long way up; Internet access costs 10 euro for one hour, or about twenty five euro for twenty five hours.
