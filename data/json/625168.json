Take the metro from Ataturk Havaliman airport (its a single line there). One can interchange to the tram line at two places - Zeytinburnu or, Aksaray. Choose the former. Aksaray is a busy stop and if you have luggage it will be very difficult to get on the tram. Also, the Aksaray tram line is a decent walking distance from the metro station. Take the tram towards Kabatas and get down at the Beyazit station (10-odd stops away). Once you get down from the tram, exit, and move in the opposite direction of the tram (on the same side of the street); turn left on the second street (Ordu Caddesi / Ordu Street) and after a steep downhill walk, you will see the hotel on your left. Staff: Kemal \u00c3\u2021elik is the manager and was very helpful. We arrived early for check in. He asked us to go to the restaurant on the terrace and get some breakfast while he completes the formalities. Since we did not spend the previous night at the hotel, it was of course complimentary. A bellboy was also on hand to take our luggage up to our rooms (there are a couple of elevators). Kemal also helped us in figuring out our two day itinerary in Old Istanbul (ask for a map), including good suggestions for places to eat. Sami is the other manager and he was helpful too. Room: Standard double room. The room was a little small, but I guess that is because it is a boutique hotel. Some sort of cable was there will few English channels (true for even 4-star hotels in Turkey). Bathrooms were adequate and clean. Since we were going to be out the whole day the room served its functional purpose. The room faced the street in front of the hotel, so there was no view to speak of. The street itself is a quite one at all times of the day. View: The terrace restaurant had a great view of the Marmara sea. The hotel is a couple of miles away from the sea. Meals: We had the breakfast at the restaurant everyday (included in the tariff). It is standard fare that you will see most hotels in Turkey, but it was fresh and good. Bread rolls, jams, olives, eggs, salads, and fruits with tea/coffee. The terrace restaurant is a great place to relax before a day of walking and sightseeing. Things around: If you walk along the tram line for 10 minutes, you will hit Sultanmehmet area after one stop. The walk itself is a good one as the street is famous for its stores, eateries, old buildings, etc. Once at Sultanmehmet you can see the Hagia Sophia (cathedral turned mosque and now a museum) - 2 hours; Basilica Cistern (underground aquaduct) - 0.5 hour; Sultanmehmet/Blue mosque (0.5 hr). The Topkapi Palace and Museum is a half day activity as the complex is a huge one so best to do it early in the day before the crowds get in. Eminonu and Karakoy (on either side of the Galata bridge - can walk and take in views of both the European and Old Istanbul sides) are a couple of tram stops away from the Sultanmehmet. Eat & Shop: There quite a few good kofta (meat ball) shops near Sultanmehmet. There is one 'Meshur Kofte', which had a few choices in the menu, but was excellent (it is also pretty famous considering the number of locals that were there). You can always grap a doner (wrap) at one of the small eateries. Sirkeci has quite a few shops for local trinkets as such. While the Grand Bazaar is not too far from the hotel, we found the prices too inflate there (as well as the Egyptian Bazaar). It is better to buy from standalone shops than from those at the Bazaar (market). There is a small market behind the Blue mosque (Artasan Bazaar), which had 6-8 shops and better prices for exactly the same things. Tips: 1. Exchange currency near the hotel; Sultanmehmet area exchange shops will give you a worse rate; 2. Do not need a taxi if you are going to hang around near the hotel and Sultanmehmet area. 3. To take tickets on the metro/tram, you would need Jeton tokens (1 token = 2 Liras = 1 trip on Metro/Train). Machines are near the stops and take both paper and coins; 4. There is an Istanbul Museum pass that is valid for 48-72 hours that gets you cheaper entry into museums (we did not know about it until later).", "Date": "October 24, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Alstonville, Australia", "Title": "\u201cGreat location, helpful staff.\u201d", "Author": "Leonie H", "ReviewID": "UR119582742", "Content": "The helpful staff, central location and comfortable room at the Hotel Niles helped make our visit Istanbul a success.

Found the displayed room rate lower than we paid through expedia so shop around or check direct with the hotel. Laundry was immaculate but takes 36 hours turnaround. We ate at local eateries where we could see locals eating and the food was great.

Book online and agree to pay cash and you're paying one of the better rates I found for a decent Istanbul hotel. The staff is friendly enough and can generally help you find what you're looking for the city. That said, the place is just decent, nothing fancy. Our standard room was quite small with a window that looked out onto a building where people inside were making handbags all day. Small bathroom. The hotel also has newer, larger suites, which seem to be well liked by other reviewers. They're cheap by Istanbul standards, so if you can afford 50 or so Euros per night more than the standard room, you might wanna go for those. Our room was spotlessly clean. There's a small lift, which is good, 'cause the building is tall. We were on the fifth floor. The vaunted rooftop cafe area is quite nice, and serves (slightly overpriced) drinks until late, but I found the view wasn't quite as great as I was expecting. Still very pleasant up there, and it was cool to go up late at night and see small groups of people hanging out, all speaking different languages. Breakfast on the roof is also pleasant, but nothing fancy. First time I've seen cocoa puffs as a regular cereal offering at an international hotel! Free wifi worked the whole time, even in our room on the fifth floor. Warning, this area of Istanbul is a tourist haven -- think narrow mazelike streets with lots of shops selling cheap souvenirs and mosty so-so food. But you can walk to several amazing attractions, or even better -- take the cheap tram at the top of the hill. You're a stop or three away from Topkapi palace, Cemberlitas hamami, The Blue Mosque and the Hagia Sofia. Take the tram a bit further and you're in the Spice Market area. Grab a ferry from there to the Asian side -- super fun. Niles is also especially super close to the Grand Bazaar, which I ironically never checked out but my wife liked. There's also a surprisingly big tea room/hookah place hidden away down an alley next to a cemetary on the main drag at the top of the hill. We stumbled upon it so late at night that we were too tired to actually sit down and experience it, but it's a seriously cool thing to seek out for the more adventurous among you. Istanbul's an amazing place, and if the Niles isn't luxurious, it's perfectly decent and puts more money in your pocket with which to see the city.", "Date": "October 4, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Seattle, Washington", "Title": "\u201cMade rest of trip better\u201d", "Author": "burnsfam", "ReviewID": "UR118871273", "Content": "Everything you need in a good hotel:quiet, very clean, good bed, hot water...but made even better by an exceptionally friendly staff and a peaceful oasis of a location.

We have stayed in quite a few budget hotels, but would not recommend the standard rooms in this one - the double bedroom was two twin beds pushed together, with single blankets and a sheet which didn't quite fit. The bathroom was tiny and clinical, and overall the room was not ideal for a week's stay at all given the price of rooms. All standard rooms also face on to a bustling road (more people noise than traffic though), so worth bearing in mind if you are a light sleeper. As other reviews have suggested, the terrace and lobby are great, the hotel is close to the tramline (though the local area is lacking in good restaurants and any bars) - and staff are friendly.

It is also a two minute walk from the Beyazit tram station from which you can reach districts that are farther away (e.g. Eminonu, Karakoy, Taksim, etc..). The Niles Hotel is a boutique hotel that is family owned and operated. The staff are extremely friendly, helpful, and speak very good English. The regular rooms are a little bit small (think Paris) but are otherwise very clean and comfortable. The suites, on the other hand, are spacious, and are decorated in a beautiful Ottoman style, which, while classic, does not feel stuffy. The hotel also offers Maisonettes, which are small apartments for 4-5 people, but I did not have a chance to see these. Breakfast at the Niles Hotel is served on the roof-top terrace, which is surrounded with flower beds and green shrubs, and offers a beautiful view of the Bosphorus. The breakfast includes a nice selection of breads and cakes, hard-boiled and scrambled eggs, various cheeses, confectioneries, juices, tea, and coffee. If you enjoy Turkish style tea, you can also ask the waiter for a cup of \"demleme shay\" (steeped tea).

The suites are really just large rooms, and would be considered large single rooms in any North American hotel chain. Having said that, and getting over a little disappointment (expectations can do that) they are well appointed, spotless, artfully decorated and the bathrooms rival luxury hotels costing double or triple the price. The penthouse suite we stayed in had a balcony with a partial sea view and large windows. The restaurant which provided a full Turkish-style breakfast was friendy and their rooftop location is very enjoyable. The hotel is central to everything important for a first, superficial visit to Istanbul, the bazar, the key mosques and museums, and about 15 minutes from the southern seaside boardwalk - which is a must-do. The exercise room, while needing some minor design improvements (aka get a towel from housekeeping for that thing called sweat) is well appointed, quiet and clean. You might need a wrench for the upright stationary bike seat though. Apart from feeling a little B&S'ed over the \"suite\" thing, our only complaint/recommendation would be to ask to have the balcony banisters wiped down before visit to the penthouse.

The sights, history and energy of this city are just unbelievable. A big part of the enjoyment of this gorgeous vacation was because of Hotel Niles. It's not a large hotel, but that makes it all the more special. The staff is so welcoming and helpful, they've become like friends, and the hotel was like a home away from home. For our arrival, in response to a few e-mails, the front office arranged for a car to pick us up from the airport. As soon as I got settled into the room, I was offered apple tea while waiting for my mother in the open, small courtyard-like section of the lobby. The location is ideal. Being interested mainly in art and history, we were able to walk to just about anywhere, but if one was looking to get to a different part of the city, the tram station is right up the hill. There, in the direction of the Blue Mosque, you will also find one amazing restaurant after another. As for the rooms, if you are traveling with friends and looking to get some quality sleep, the standard rooms are fine. They are small, but very clean and have all you need. If you are looking for a romantic getaway or need a bit more comfort, I'd recommend spending a little more on a suite. The suites are gorgeous! Decorated with traditional ottoman details and featuring large all-marble bathrooms, they add a luxurious touch for the right price. The back of the hotel is probably a little more quiet, but the hotel is not on a busy street, so I don't think it makes much of a difference. In the mornings, breakfast is served on the roof where one can choose to sit in the covered part filled with plants and flowers or on the open terrace. With fresh and dried fruits, yogurt, cereal, as well as fresh-baked goods and platters of cheese, olives and fresh vegetables, the breakfast was the perfect start to our days. At the end of the day, you can wind down on the terrace by enjoying drinks while enjoying the beautiful view of the water. The staff always served cut-up fruit and other snacks. Walking the hilly city all day gave us enough of a workout, but the hotel does have a small gym that is clean and, with two treadmills, two stationary bikes and free weights, well equipped. Free WiFi is also available, although a bit slow when we stayed there. We were told that the internet was being worked on at the time. However, other than checking a few e-mails, there was not much need for it since the hotel staff had all recommendations we were looking for. Whatever excursion we were in the mood for, Kemal, the front office manager, was able to tell us all about it and let us know the best way to get there, be it historical sites, restaurants, or just where to find a good selection of Turkish music CDs.

The breakfast buffet (included in the price) that we have every morning on the rooftop terrace is delicious. All of the ingredients are fresh and some are even home baked. The rooms are quite simple, so do not be disappointed by the lack of bedroom decor, but they are very clean and well maintained. Although the twin rooms (suites are decorated differently) are lacking in visual interest, the rest of the hotel makes up for it.

They were particularly helpful in booking my side trip to Izmir, Selcuk, and Ephesus, and also sending my luggage back home via DHL. The breakfast on the roof terrace is compete and included. The roof is open 24/7. It is especially peaceful in the evening. Just be careful of a certain clever seagull that likes to steal food if you leave your table unattended. The standard room is perfectly clean and comfortable, but if you want to upgrade to a deluxe suite, they have those available too. The rates are truly reasonable. Internet access is free or free use of computer in lobby for checking emails. I would return in a heartbeat. Istanbul is the most extraordinary East meets West, old and new, fusion city of today.

One of the prettiest rooms I've stayed in anywhere in Europe. It's located just below the rooftop terrace, but noise was never an issue. In fact, the hotel is remarkably quiet, and the soundproofing must be good, because I never heard the morning call to prayer. Many of the reviews mention the helpful, friendly staff. All true -- from the front desk to the rooftop staff. You couldn't ask for a nicer, friendlier group. Location is a two-minute walk to the tram. Two short stops and you're at the \"main\" attractions (which you can also walk to in 15 or so minutes). I loved the location because while it's close to everything, it's tucked into a less touristy area of the city.

The shower and plumbing fixtures were top notch and well maintained. We could hear a bit of the city at night including pigeons in the morning but our current home is situated near a busier road so this was quieter for us. We did need think that the room was less functional than it could have been. There weren't too many places to unpack or hang clothes. The television was placed inconveniently on a mini fridge. The main room could use a few minor repairs (wall paper retouching and newer linens). The terrace upstairs is beautiful and we never had to wait for a seat at breakfast. The breakfast itself was just enough -- although we were a little disappointed at the yoghurt (thinner than usual) and there wasn't that much substantial food. Then again, my companion and I eat more breakfast than the average couple so we may not be fair on this point. The terrace is open 24 hours a day which makes it convenient for any wind-down drinks later at night or simply a nice conversation. Airport transfer was also quick and the drivers always very friendly. Never tried or sought out the gym room since we walked enough up and down inclines within Istanbul to not need further exercise!

They both have amazing hospitality and service, you would never find anything comparable in North America. They both have immaculately clean rooms, but the rooms at the Hotel Niles were larger for the same price. At the White House, we had 3 adults and 1 ten year old in a room with a double and two cots. A bit crowded! At the Hotel Niles, we had a Maissonette Suite, which was perfectly laid out for a family - two singles upstairs and a double down. Tons of room, and a huge beautiful bathroom. The White House was possibly better located to the major tourist attractions, but the Hotel Niles is close to the Grand Bazaar. Both are located right by the tram line, which makes it easy to get anywhere in the city. If I go back to Istanbul, I would choose the Hotel Niles only because the room was much larger for the same price. The rooftop breakfast terrace Hotel Niles also has a lovely view of the harbour, whereas at the White House, the breakfast was served in the basement. Both breakfasts were good. Our room at the Hotel Niles was lovely and dark, as well as quite soundproof and the bed was lovely and comfortable.

I knew something was up when the arranged taxi parked by the entrance and the concierge came out with a huge smile and a warm greeting welcoming me to the city. Beautiful property, location that can' be beat, great value... I'll get to all that. But it was the service that really impressed me. You just don't stay at many hotels where the concierge will walk out the door with you after checking out and stand at the doorstep and wave goodbye as the taxi whisks you away. That's something my mom does let alone the front desk staff at a hotel. Location-wise this hotel is perfect. I used arranged transportation to and from the airport but also had the option of public transportation since the Beyazit tram stop is a short walk away. All the major sites are nearby so I never felt the need to curtail exploration by taking the buses or tram. I was able to walk to Galata Tower and up most of Istiklal Avenue from the hotel. That's a lot of walking... and my legs felt it at the end of each day. For the closer sites it was nice to be able to easily reach the hotel if I needed to nap or take a break during the day. There's also a little store down the street where you can stock up on snacks and supplies. I booked one of the suites and the room was beautiful. Check out the pics. Now I gave five circles for value but take into consideration that I went during the off-season and there was a special rate for suites when I booked. (Little note for those not wanting to get lost - there are two separate staircases: one for the suites and one for regular rooms. Got lost the first day thinking my room had disappeared.) The marble bathroom had a heated floor. Traditional Turkish decor throughout. Tiny little TV but that's not what you're there for. There's a king bed and a twin that also acts as a couch if you're alone. I can say that after a long day of wandering the confusing streets I always looked forward to coming back to my room. There's a daily breakfast on the rooftop terrace every morning. I posted pics of the buffet spread so you can get an idea of what you're getting. Sometimes it's late at night and you don't want to walk somewhere to get food. The hotel has a menu from a local restaurant down the street... it's actually near the little convenience store. The doorman/bellhop would whip out the menu and make some great recommendations on what to order. They deliver it to your room on a plate and you can take it upstairs and have a nice little dinner with a view. If you actually had the energy after a full day of walking there are plenty of places to eat within walking distance. I was a big fan of Sar. You'll see this place on the right side of the main road that follows the tram when walking towards Hagia Sophia and the Blue Mosque. They have a place of the same name around the corner from that location... eat there instead since it's much nicer. Just turn right on the first side street that you see when you pass Sar and you'll see it about half a block down. Service-wise the staff was amazing. You get extra points when a new concierge whom I've never met knows your name when you go downstairs in the morning. When you venture out for the first time you get the orientation. They pull out a nice little map and teach you the basics of getting around, where to eat, where to go, you name it. They booked me for the Turkish Dance Night at Hodjapasha show on a Saturday night... I highly recommend this outing. It looks like I've written a short story here but I think you get the gist of what I'm saying. Hotel Niles is a fantastic hotel with staff that genuinely care about your stay and experience in this amazing city. I'd stay here again without question.

When arriving in the evening, after many hours of travel, my initial reaction was to wonder if I had made a mistake: the surrounding streets were dark, sketchy, and strewn with garbage. First impressions, arriving at night, were not positive. The hotel lobby, though, was inviting, and I received an enthusiastic welcome from the desk clerk. My room proved to be clean, comfortable, and well-maintained, if basic. Breakfast the next morning -- served in the rooftop cafe -- was an awesome way to start the day (even if the never-changing selection of items became pretty boring after a few days). As I learned my way around the area, I realized that the streets being strewn with garbage seems to be a nightly occurrence: rather than put things in bins or bags, local merchants pitch their refuse on the street. It is gone in the morning... but, if you arrive late at night be prepared to be unimpressed with the area, which is not particularly scenic to begin with, and is even less welcoming when covered with refuse. The great thing about the hotel's location is that it is within easy walking distance of the tram and all the major historic attractions in Sultanahmet. Restaurants are overpriced in this area, so my routine was this -- fill up on a hearty breakfast at the hotel, visit monuments in the morning, and then seek out another neighborhood off the tourist track for lunch and dinner. There are plenty of tasty and inexpensive options throughout the city, but finding non-touristy options in Sultanahmet requires some effort. If you are interested in nightlife, this may not be the best area for you, but there are some cool cafes and hookah bars that stay open late in the area. If I had it to do over again, I would probably split my stay between Sultanahmet and Beyoglu -- or consider staying in Beyoglu the entire time. (I particularly enjoyed my day trip to the Asian side, but staying there would be impractical.) The Hotel Niles proved to be a reliable, safe, and pleasant -- if slightly bland -- place to stay. I'd recommend it, unless you are intent on partying all night long on Istiklal Cadessi, in which case you should consider something nearer to Taksim, probably, since the trams don't run very late.", "Date": "November 28, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Moscow, Russia", "Title": "\u201cGreat Hotel with Friendly Very Helpful Staff\u201d", "Author": "BHillyard", "ReviewID": "UR88235067", "Content": "Our stay in Istanbul was recommended by some friends at work and they were spot on with all that they had said.

We had one of the 'new suite' rooms, so comments are all based on those rather than a standard room. The overall experience was superb. The room was exceptionally clean, comfortable, well-sized and decorated in a cute and welcoming way, exactly as described on the website. I particularly liked the bathroom: done completely in handsome striped marble, the layout and decor made what was a normally-sized bathroom feel enormous, and the addition of a Turkish bath style bowl was very welcome. Wireless internet was free and fast, a pleasant bonus. Housekeeping exceeded expectations - room left spotless, personal possessions carefully and neatly placed, truly excellent service, which was in keeping with the rest of the staff, who were all eager to be helpful without being oppressive. Breakfast in the adorable roof room/terrace was included in the room rate which meant that I considered this very good value for money. Terrace has a nice view of the Marmara in the distance, breakfast selection is good though not outstanding. However everything was fresh and appetizing and there was enough variety to have something different each morning we were here so can't complain really! Location was also wonderful for our purposes. We wanted somewhere close to the tourist action but not actually located right in the main tourist bit, and with good links to elsewhere in the city. The Niles fits the bill as it is right across from the Grand Bazaar (though in a quiet, normal neighbourhood side street), comfortable walking distance from the main attractions such as the Blue Mosque etc, and right next to a tram station from which the vast majority of locations can be reached. Some might prefer to be in a nicer area or right in the heart of the action, but for our purposes this was perfect.

The odd three foot span seagull drifts past in an arrogant but wasted show of self-appointed superiority. As the sun is setting the utterly clear, eggshell blue sky is becoming infused with ochre and crimson on the western horizon.

I was concerned about fake reviews of the Niles but stayed there anyway. I spent a lot of time trying to decide where to stay for a long weekend in Istanbul and was very pleased with the Niles. There are so many different neighborhoods to stay in Istanbul -- it's difficult to choose, but I think this is a good place for a first-time visitor. Most tourist hotels are in the Sultahmeht (sp?) so this is a nice mid-range option *away* from the touristy area but still very close by (2 tram stops or a 10-15 minute walk). This hotel is very close to the Grand Bazaar, which is helpful if you plan on doing a lot of shopping. The hotel is also very close to the handy transportation system -- only 2 stops to the major tourist attractions. For a first visit, it is in an ideal location. If you are going to Istanbul to go to the clubs, I would NOT stay here. All of the fancy waterfront clubs are on the other side of Istanbul, on the other side of the river. It would be difficult and expensive to find your way back to the Niles at 5 a.m. If you are a clubber, I would suggest staying at either the 4 seasons or the Radisson SAS in that area, both on the water. Alternatively, staying in the Taksim area would at least have you on the right side of the river. The rooftop cafe was nice -- I had a nice and cheap dinner from the cafeteria 2 blocks away on 2 different nights. They deliver to the hotel rooftop, and the food is good and cheap. They do serve booze. I had a room facing the street just 1 floor up -- and it was still very quiet. The area shuts down in the evenings. (If you like to be able to walk out your front door to a bar, stay elsewhere.) I thought the staff was quite nice. They were always very helpful and friendly... and they definitely took pride in their work, which I thought was quite nice, too. The free high speed internet worked quite well for me in my room -- I was able to use skype as well. There is a computer for free general use in the lobby. On the downside, I would say the following: My room was sort of run-down -- but I wasn't expecting the Taj Mahal for the price. The hotel is in the garment district -- you don't have to look to far to see/hear garment workers in the windows of the buildings on all sides of the cafe. Hence, the area immediately surrounding the hotel isn't great, either -- I made a point of being back before dark, as a solo female traveler. This would not be a good place to stay if you have difficulty walking or require a wheelchair. The hotel is located on a steep hill and the street going up to the main road is paved with very, very rough cobblestones -- I was worried about slipping and falling and made several wrong steps myself, tearing up the heels of my shoes.

The staff were very accommodating and always provided me with sound, honest, advice about site seeing, restaurants, short-distance travel plans, etc. The proximity of the hotel to the tram line was also very helpful. It makes travel that much easier, and I felt very comfortable traveling on my own at night because the distance between the tram stop and the hotel was only a few hundred meters.

Kemal, the manager, couldn't have been friendlier or more helpful. He even surprised us with a tray of birthday surprises for my husband: a delicious little cake, Turkish delight, nuts, wine and flowers. It was such a thoughtful thing to do for guests celebrating their birthdays in Istanbul. Kemal clearly puts a lot of thought into his guests' experience from the moment they walk in and are warmly welcomed until they sadly climb into a taxi for the airport. He is a master of customer service and it shows throughout the staff. Hakan, who also works at the front desk and just graduated from Istanbul University (congratulations, Hakan!), is a very warm and witty guy who generously shared his expertise about the city and helped us with our embarrassingly bad pronunciation of Turkish words. Onur and Ayse, two other university students, were delightful conversationalists at breakfast; we really enjoyed talking to them both (and wish them the best in their university program -- hope you get to do the study-abroad option in the Netherlands, Onur and Ayse!).

At our request staff arranged for a van to transport us to Ataturk airport at the end of our stay, at a rate of 20 Turkish lira (which was a good rate): the driver was prompt, courteous and helpful.

Its location is perfect, in the historical Istanbul, in Beyazit, with shops and the university, lively during the day and safe at night, 5 minutes walking from the Gran Bazaar and 10/15 minutes from the Blue Mosque. If you don't want to walk to the Blue Mosque or Hagya Sophia you can catch the tram which is 2 minutes far away, and brings you then whereever you want to go in Istanbul. The complete hotel staff is very friendly, professional, and helpful, the concierge Kemal was very nice and never \"tired\" of our thousand questions that we had: he helped us through the jungle of choices what to see, where to go, where to eat, and he always suggested places that met our tastes and his hints and tips led us right to where we wanted to go. Thank you Kemal! The hotel style is traditional and comfortable. We were 10 people had 5 rooms and were all very satisfied with our rooms. The rooms are nice and very clean, (the room service is flawless) I stayed in a suite and it was like living a honeymoon, very tasteful colours and furniture, spacy bathroom - the suites are beautiful! It is also suitable for business travellers - I found free wifi in every single corner! The breakfast room is on the roof top of the hotel where we could overlook the area of Beyzit and the Bosporus, a beautiful place which is open as bar during the day and at night, to meet your friends, to read a book or just to relax. The price/performance ratio is extremely good. They do offer a pick up and drop off service from/to the airport at a very reasonable price.

The taxi driver seemed a bit unsure of the location, but after making few phone calls to his friends (other drivers I assume), he seemed to be well on the way. The hotel is on a small side street, but not far from the main drag of Ordu Cadesi, and about a 10 minute walk from the major sights of the Blue Mosque, Hagia Sophia, etc. When we arrived, we were informed that the air conditioning in our room was not working (not good on a 90F/32C day), but that a repair man would be coming the next morning. They said they were full for that night, so they could not move us, but if the repair man wasn't able to fix the AC the next day, they would move us to an available room then after another guest checked out. At this point, we were nervous, expecting that we were going to get a constant barrage of excuses for why we had no AC and why they couldn't move us. We slept a rather uncomfortable night (they did provide a fan, but it really just blew the hot air around) before heading off for our first day of touristing. Upon our return around dinner time, we were informed that they had been unable to fix the AC and that they had already moved our belongings (except of course for those items in the safe) to the room next door to our original. The AC worked fine in this room and we stayed there quite comfortably for the rest of our stay. The rooms were smallish and basic, but we were there to be tourists, not to spend our time in the hotel. The rooms were very clean - if a bit worn - and contained a small refrigerator, which was nice. The bed was comfortable and adequate for two people. The hotel is well located, but you do have to walk 10 minutes or so for a decent restaurant, but no big deal in nice weather. The street that it is located on looks a bit sketchy after dark, but we were assured by the hotel staff that it is totally safe, and even when returning late at night we never felt unsafe. Some reviews here (and for other hotels) have complained about the sound of the call to prayer early in the morning, but I don't know why they would hold this against the hotel. You can hear the call EVERYWHERE in the city, so to expect you wouldn't hear it in your hotel is pretty stupid. The wireless internet was a bit testy, as some others have mentioned, but it worked well enough, and there is a PC in the lobby that you can use if the wireless isn't working or if you don't have a laptop with you. Breakfast is included in the room rate and is served on the rooftop terrace. The selection was good, including a few hot dishes, fruit, pastries, juice, coffee, tea, etc. The view from the rooftop terrace on a sunny morning is amazing too. The terrace is also open in the evenings. They serve drinks on the terrace, so you can eat dinner here if you get takeout, but they won't allow you to buy the drinks elsewhere and bring them to the terrace. The staff were extremely helpful, recommending several excellent restaurants, and helping us to order pizza from a local shop one evening when we were too worn out from touristing to venture back out for dinner. We paid \u00e2\u201a\u00ac57 per night, which is below the rack rate, by booking through third party site. We were not given any hassle about the price by the hotel staff. They did charge our credit card in Lira for the room, which I found a bit odd since they even quote rates on their website in \u00e2\u201a\u00ac, but no big deal, because the exchange rate that they gave was pretty much even with what I found when looking it up myself. All in all, I would give the hotel itself 3 stars, but the 5 star helpfulness of the staff averages out to a 4 star rating.

They provided me and my wife with maps of the local area as well as orientation to ensure you know your way round, recommendation on where to eat on the first night (Meshur Karideniz - which was delicious and excellent value at 17YTL for 2 people!) and they loaned me a free plug converter when I asked where I could buy one? On our 2nd day it happened to be my wife's birthday and they must have spotted this from the registration form we filled in at check in, when we returned from a day of sightseeing there was a bowl of fruit, nuts and turkish delight along with a birthday message waiting on the bed. It's a small gesture but one that had a very big impact. The location may seem a little off putting at first as you are surrounded by textile wholesalers however you are literally a 10 minute walk (15 min max) from all the main tourist sites like the Blue Mosque, Hagia Sophia and only across the road from the Grand Bazaar and Bayazid Mosque. If you don't feel like walking then Beyazit Tram station is 2 minutes away and is defnitely the best way of getting round all the main tourist sites for just 1.5 YTL per person per journey. My wife and I did not need to use a taxi during our stay. On most nights we walked back to the hotel and we felt completely safe walking down the streets. I generally felt safer in Istanbul more so than I would in London or Manchester. The view from the terrace is amazing, you can see the Marmara Sea on one side and the Dome and Minaret of the Beyazid Mosque on the other. The breakfast has all the items one would expect from any breakfast buffet and offers a good choice. Make sure you try the home made cakes and the spinach and cheese pastries which were very nice and moreish. Whilst the Hotel only offers breakfast on the roof terrace you can order in from the nearby restaurant and have your meal on the terrace. The rooms are clean, which is my main requirement, a lot of people here have complained that they're a bit on the small side but to be honest I didn't find them any smaller than some hotels I've stayed at in London so I guess they're of a typical European size. The Bathroom was very clean and the shower always had hot water at good water pressure. There's free wifi available in the rooms and you're provided a passcode on checking in. We booked the airport transfer on the way in which was expensive at 25 Euros but I would recommend this especially if you're unfamiliar with Istanbul as I would have found it near impossible to direct a taxi driver. We booked a return shuttle from the hotel to the airport which was cheaper at 16 Euros and we got a clean vehicle which arrived at the hotel on time. All in all, I would struggle to find a fault with Hotel Niles, on checking out Seda saw us off to the door and literally waved us goodbye, you really do feel that the staff all take pride in their job and really put in 100%. I have also stayed at the Atlantis in Dubai which was also very nice (but then it would be given it's a 5 star resort) however in terms of providing that personal touch Hotel Niles wins hands down in my opinion. I loved Istanbul and will definitely return and will have no qualms about staying at Hotel Niles again.", "Date": "November 17, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Toronto, Canada", "Title": "\u201cExceptional value, location and service\u201d", "Author": "ozcanuck", "ReviewID": "UR49189613", "Content": "Had a three night stay at the Niles in early October.

Wireless internet was available throughout the hotel (except on the rooftop restaurant). The room was exactly what you'd expect, slightly compact but clean, comfortable and functional. Perhaps my only complaint would have been a lack of a bathroom vanity, but that is just being picky and wasn't really a huge issue - typical european style. The breakfast was ok - nothing memorable but enough \"continental\" choices to fill one up before a day of sightseeing. Staff were great - always refilling coffee and replenishing the food. The staff were exceptional, every interaction with them was pleasant and helpful - they really do go out of their way to make your stay in Istanbul a nice one.

The staff are wonderful, from the friendly General Manager to the superb front-desk manager - the indispensible Seda, and the glorious roof-top cafe and lounge with dazzling views is simply hard to leave after the leisurely included breakfast. The rooms are basic, very clean, and we only slept there as we were busy shopping and shopping. No real room service, though food can be ordered in to eat on the terrace with drinks provided there. The rooms are not really big enough to eat in. All three of us - professors on the way to and from a conference in Bursa, Turkey - were previous visitors to Istanbul, just an endlessly fascinating city. So, we were not so interested in sightseeing. But the Niles is right off the Tram line (the Blue Mosque just three stops away, the Egyptian Spice Market just beyond that), across the street from Istanbul University and the Grand Bazaar right next door. Also, you quickly figure out, or hear, that as fascinating as the huge Bazaar is, the best deals are all around the Niles Hotel where the wholesalers and workshops are. Leather everything, both gaudy and exquisite, textiles, clothes, silks, jewelry, suitcases of all kinds ... just walk out the front door and start spending. It's worthwhile noting that the hotel arranges very reliable transportation to and from the Airport for only 25 Euros. Also, if you pay your bill in cash they offer a 10% discount. The above-mentioned Tram will also take you over to the Taksim area, which is the other main suggested area to base a visit to Istanbul and where we'd stayed before. But the perfect location and excellent service at the Hotel Niles is our preferred location.

We have never posted a review but our recent stay at the Hotel Niles truly deserve a word or two. Hotel Niles is a boutique hotel located in the Beyazit district - 5minutes from the Grand Bazaar, a short leisurely walk to theTopkapi Palace, Agia Sofia & the Blue Mosque. The tram stop is conveniently located at the end of the street where you'll also find a fantastic delicacy shop seeling all flavors of baklavas and trukish delights. On first arrival, you might get slightly disappointed with the location as the hotel is right smack in the center of business establishments and on a narrow street but don't let this mislead you. It is in fact conveniently located and a very safe place to be in. We once returned to the hotel around 1am after a Turkish dinner and show in a nearby restaurant and never felt any threat to our safety. Being a boutique hotel, please do not expect to find large sized rooms. However, the clealiness of the room, the bathroom and the hotel in general makes for a very pleasant stay. The attention to detail and the level of service is the real reason for this review. The impeccable service we received from Seda, the front office manager, Murat the rooftop terrace server and the hotel staff altogether made our stay very enjoyable. They were always so willing to help with suggestions and anything we needed were taken care of immediately. I think this is a great advantage to staying in smaller hotels. One night, we couldn't sleep because of the time difference and found ourselves in the 24hour rooftop terrace and Murat prepared sandwiches and served us the delicious apple tea - all complimentary! He even kept us entertained until it was time to say goodnight at 4am. Our short 4 night stay was really made enjoyable by Seda and her staff and we're looking forward to our next trip as there is still so much to see of this beautiful country.

As promised, via email, I was met at the airport by a driver whose English was limited but whose demeanor was friendly and willing to try and communicate as we struggled through rush hour traffic. The staff expected me and ushered me to my single room which was actually a double bed. As a 2 star hotel, the facilities were modest but more than adequate. Abundant hot water, crisp sheets, working AC and TV and even a small frig. Not luxurious for those who want pampering but in no sense uncomfortable or cramped. Like many European hotels, the room was smaller than US rooms, but it was spotless. An energy savings feature is that your key parks in a slot so that when you leave all the lights and appliances turn off within 15 seconds. But as you need the same key to unlock the door, timing the process can be tricky at night. Breakast on the roooftoip terrace was wonderful. Great food, from local bureks and cheeses and yogurt, to more western cereals and scrambled eggs and fresh vegetables. Juice and coffee and tea were always fresh and good. Staffers were eager to help and bused dishes quickly. The view from the roof was lovely, both inside and out. Desk staff had good English skills and were very eager to help me. They pointed me towar the Bosphoros tour pier, told me how much and how to buy it. My unusual trip to Iznik required them to look up sea-bus schedules and prices and minibus conenctions from Yalova to Iznik and back. Except for some momentary confusion at the IDO ticket window owing to my lack of Turkish and their lack of English everything went very smoothly. But without guidance from the hotel staff it would have been much harder. I observed the entire staff to be friendly, eager to help, and competent. The waiter on staff will call a nearby locanta and have dinner delievered to the hotel where you can eat it on the same rooftop terrace at night. They serve drinks then (additional cost) alo ng with other small foods. For someone traveling alone the nightly chance to relax and even converse with the staff was great. One could hardly feel more at ease or at home anywhere else. One staffer regretted I could not come home to meet his family.

Honestly, there are other hotels and bed and breakfasts elsewhere in Istanbul that are more conveniently located, with better service, better rooms, better food AND at a better price. I suppose if you are with a big group, and you cannot stay in a smaller location then consider this place, but otherwise look around. Also, I must confess: after a travelling in Turkey, we were a little stunned to find such a high concentration of American tourists in one hotel! If you like this, this is your place, if you want more local colour and international variety in the hotel guests, beware!! Your breakfast on the terrace will most likely include guys in baseball caps slurping up breakfast cereal and older retired American businessmen loudly telling other guests how they could run the economy better than Obama (this was my direct experience). The rooms were standard, and fairly simple when compared to other Turkish hotel rooms, with an ancient TV that did not work. The food was likewise standard, and had less than the usual Turkish selection (plus American fares such as omelets and cereal). The terrace view is also so-so as there is another terrace under construction between you and any view of the Marmara Sea, which is not that close to Beyazit in any case. Beyazit is a fine location for shopping at the grand bazaar, but you would be better off staying in Sultanahmet or Beyoglu.

The location is good with the hotel about a 5-15 minute walk from the central historical sites.

However, as it is not in the central historical area, there are limited late night options for food and it gets pretty quiet. During the day, there are lots of food places, ATMs, etc minutes away.

Also, my shower drained a little slowly. Bottom line: Despite its small size and modest price, the hotel is a classy affair.

Breakfast with a view is a great way to start the day. Our first room, 301, was nicely furnished, but without a writing table and single chair, plus the flat screen tv was oddly placed and didn't work well. So we moved to 403 which had an older tv, but BBC, CNN etc, plus a small table and chair. Because my husband and I both had computers and telephones that needed to be plugged in, we found that the 2 electrical outlets on only one side of the room were inadequate. The one multiple plug was already octopus-like with the tv, light, and fridge plugged into it. We did end up totally rearranging the furniture in our room just to make access to the outlets more convenient. The wifi connection had a good, strong signal, which was essential for us. The air conditioner was quiet and efficient. The view out our window was not so great, but the street wasn't a very loud street either, despite the great location (Beyazit). The bathrooms are small, with a shower, no bathtub, but with all that one needs. Our hook was broken off the back of the bathroom door and the area where the closet is needs a light. It was very hard to see inside the closet. They do provide a small safe, which we appreciated and used. We got a special limited offer that included airport pickup with the cost of the room, which was a luxury.

Look at the menu outside before entering and ask for a discount. Once inside ask the price before ordering anything - they have a habit of bumping up the bill. The food, however, is excellent. You should get a plate of Sea Bass, Sea Bream etc for around 12-20 Lira. The wine is drinkable for 30-40 Lira. Hamdi's is good but a little pricy and you get rushed. There's lots of smaller, cheaper restaurants - PIknic's is a good chain and there's one (go straight out of door, keep walking straight down street, first right, then first left, down on right hand side (name starts with a B).

What sets Niles off from most hotels I have seen around the world is their Ultra personal touch. The front office manager, a gentleman named Kemal, was so in tuned at making sure everything you need was taken care of or addressed. In my case it was restaurants. I would pick one or ask his advise... While I am getting ready for dinner, he would arrange the reservations, implore to the restaurants how important of a guest I was, and to take care of me.

Waking up a little later, I tried to turn the lights on. The card for the lights is on the keychain that he had with him. I had no lights, no clock and was locked in the room. There is no way out if you don't have a key! I phoned the front desk, but at that time of night, the person on duty didn't speak English.

I can agree with most of the reviews on this website of this hotel - basic, cheap, clean with very nice and informative personnel. The hotel is near the Grand Bazaar, etc. just two blocks off the Ordu Caddesi (the street with the tram) but the hotel is still (as others reviews have stated) very difficult to find. I took the subway and tram from the airport for only 2.80 lira (1.40 for the metro from the airport Havalimani station to Azytinburnu then the tram from there to the Beyazit station) in 60 minutes. The hotel does have a 25 Euro pickup service that would definitely be worth it if arriving after dark. Having a map or printout with the hotels location to show a cab driver is a good suggestion. I found the hotel to be basic, cheap and clean. It is not a 4 or 5 star experience as the rooms, while acceptable, are spartan to say the least. I was in room 403 and could still hear the elevator going up and down and there was another room between me and the elevator shaft. My suggestion, don't take rooms x01, x02 or x03 if you are a light sleeper. Also, I heard one guest complain and request a different room because he was on the top (5th) floor and the breakfast room was right above him and he could hear the employees walking around, moving chairs, etc. The hotel, while only 2 blocks from the main tourist street, is in a marginal area. There are several other hotels in the area and the Hotel Niles is definitely the best of the bunch. It is newly remodeled with small rooms, very small showers, thin walls and door jams that will hit your head if you're 6'2\" or taller as I am. The street is lively with vehicles and people so the hotel has double paned glass windows that keep out most of the noise. The beds were, for me, a little small and hard with flimsy blankets but I still slept very soundly as I spent my days walking and was very tired when I returned. I would definitely agree that the breakfast, while acceptable, was made more pleasant by the amazing views of the Sea of Marmara - definitely a very positive way to start the day. The rooms do have very small televisions that receive only 2 english language stations (CNN and BBC) but who goes to Istanbul to watch TV. As others have stated, the hotel staff is the most friendly I have ever encountered in my world travels. The were very knowledgeable and genuinely curious as to what I had seen and had suggestions for possible out-of-the-way sites to visit.

The rooms were spotless and had everything we needed including air-conditioning - a must at this time of year and great hot shower!

The next morning, we asked at the desk before breakfast, but nothing had turned up.

He provided us with a map, told us where to go and off we went. Check in itself was very painless and before we were allowed to go to our room, they proudly showed us the roof terrace, and introduced us to the owner. The terrace (where breakfast is served) has views of the Sea of Marmara (those seagulls were big!). Breakfast itself is more than adequate unless you are looking for a full cooked breakfast. During breakfast, Seda (the front office manager) would appear and greet every table of guests with 'Good Morning, how are you!' She then went on to enquire how our stay was going and seemed almost disappointed if we didn't have a question for her or require some assistance with our travel plans. The room was clean and very compact , if we weren't only using it as somewhere to sleep it wouldn't have been big enough. The TV was small and reception was poor and it was almost impossible to sit and watch it comfortably -but then, with so much to see and do in Istanbul, we didn't find this a problem. The bathroom was small but had everything we needed - lighting was not great for shaving! The A/C in our room was great; our room looked out onto the street but it was very quiet. However, there was some internal noise from neighbouring rooms but never too intrusive. The wi-fi in the room worked well and it was great to have free internet access in reception. Overall, this small and friendly hotel would be our choice every time. They try hard to make you feel welcome and succeed.

We stayed there for a total of 6 nights. I admit, I am rather picky and give tough (but hopefully fair)reviews. In summary: Pros: 1. Hotel is an excellent value. We paid 62 Euros (cash price) and took advantage of the airport pick up. Rooms were relatively modern and clean. 2. As previously written, the terrace on the roof of the building has a great view and is wonderful for breakfast or early evening drinks. 3. The staff (with specific compliments for Seda) are very friendly and try to accomodate all requests. 4. Location is excellent for sightseeing in wonderful Istanbul. 5. Definitely eat at the kabob house next door. To save money on any additional charges, order and prepay for the food yourself (very reasonable prices) and have it delivered to the roof top terrace. We ate there 3 times (sometimes for a late lunch) and it was always excellent. Cons: 1. The room we booked (upper floor) was not given to us by the evening check in clerk (a relatively new employee who said \"all the rooms are the same\"). The room was tiny and had many problems (AC, lamp, bathroom size) and luckily Seda helped us the next day in transferring us to one of the rooms on the 5th floor which had more space. 2. Due to the design of the rooms, there is only a very tiny closet, which accomodates only 5 hanging items, plus some small shelve space. Since we were a couple who had packed for a 14-day vacation, it was impossible to unpack our suitcases and to store or hang up much of our clothes. This was a problem, especially for my wife. Bottomline: this is an excellent hotel for those on a tight budget but are looking for a good value.

The negatives : 1- We booked an aiport pickup. NO one was at the airport despite us looking at all the boards for 30 mins. This was denied by Cemil (jamil??) at reception. We made our own way via a transfer booked at a private counter at the airport who took 2 hours to find the hotel as it is an obscure area off a main road close to the grand bazaar and Istanbul university. Also someone should tell Cemil to stop saying free of charge. i.e \"wireless internet is free of charge\". \"Breakfast is free of charge\". No its not , its included in your room rate. 2- We emailed the hotel asking for confirmation of the airport transfer and also a twin bed room. We got a double room wedged in the corner of the hotel all the way to to the top. The guy that showed us the room asked us with a dirty smirk 'You are sleeping in 1 bed'. Um no we asked for two beds. We are best mates .... 3- The room was very clean but it looked like it had been decorated at the time of Ataturk and not been changed since. The decor would apeal to ppl that loves parquet floors and wall paper. 4. When i checked out after being here for only 2 hours I was not even asked if there was anything they could do to help me change my mind. offering us a refund would have been great but hey..... 5 the bed was rock hard and could not have accomodated two adults confortably who aint in a relationship. Hence the request for twin beds. 6- The location is just naff, there are no retaurants close by at all bar the dodgy looking kebab shop next door. if you like cheap stylish clothes then i guess this is a good location. The positives 1 - Clean 2 - Nice service 3 - free wireless though it contsantly drops I unfortnately did not find this hotel great and checked out after two hours as the electricty constantly dropped in the room and i could not be bothered to complain about it as they had no other rooms available in any case. This also meant the room was bloody hot and the window had to be left open which meant that the street noise came in . I moved to a five star hotel which in hindsight is what i should have booked in the first place as istanbul is truly one of those places that u get what u pay for.

I was rather weary about booking the hotel as there were hardly any reviews on Trip and after spending several weeks searching for a moderately priced hotel (in S.A. Rands) i contacted some trip forum members and decided on the Niles (pronounced Neeless) not knowing where i was going and what i would find. We organised a shuttle to the hotel where we were welcomed by a cheerful young Seda - the front office manager. It was early evening when we got in and our room was ready - even the air conditioning had been turned on awaiting our arrival. Everyone at the hotel was extremely helpful from the little young lady who cleaned our room (no english) to the General Manager. The room was 15 sq. metres and had a double bed (or two twins), a fridge, little table and 2 chairs. Neat, clean and simple. The bathroom however was teeny. You could not bend down in the shower without hitting the back wall if you were to try and pick up a piece of soap. It consisted of a shower, basin and toilet - probably about 4 sq. metres.(the shower itself being less than a sq. metre) Cupboards in Istanbul from what i have been reading seems to be a problem and so it was at the hotel Niles too. Two shelves, a safety deposit box (very convenient) and about 4 hangers. If only they would turn the rod to hang up clothes the other way (horizontally) one could have space . The rod was placed across the depth as opposed to across the width. Fresh soaps, towels, shampoo every morning. Breakfast was included and served on the top terrace with a lovely view of the Bosphorus. Two cheeses, juice, 2-3 fruits, boiled eggs and scrambled eggs, oats, and 2 other cereals, cumber, tomato and olives. Some home made goodies and bread. Coffee, tea or apple tea. After 4 days it got a bit boring though. The fruit didnt always taste fresh and i think its something they could brush up upon. Again though excellent service and after the 3rd day without asking i was given hot milk for my coffee. There is a computer for hotel guests which didnt work some days but no problem - i was given either Seda's to check my mail or on one occassion the General Managers.

The location is brilliant. Ten minutes walk to The Blue Mosque and Haghia Sophia ( actually it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the Aya Sofya) and ten minutes by tram to The Galata bridge. The kebab place next door is very good value and the food is simple but we found it nice and safe. We used their airport pick up service which costs 25 euro to the hotel and 20 euro back. Well worth it. However the main downside is that there is no sound proofing in the rooms and if your neighbours (above you, below you or next next door to you) have an early flight their four am alarm call will also become yours. Doors bang all night long and the vibrations permeate the structure and in a city which is prone to earthquakes being rudely awoken at 3 in the morning with your mirrors shuddering is quite disconcerting.

This is a rare find. - breakfast was consistent; warm eggs, light meats, and breads. the fresh fruit was always welcome each Am and the view is outstanding. - the room was spotless, well maintained, and typical in Euro size; the bath met my expecttations while the water was HOT and with amazing pressure. Overall ... I would come here again if i stayed at Sultanahmet/Beyzet area Suggestions: The \"New district\" certainly is where i spent most of my time once I went through the usual monuments on the old town side. So I would probably be looking for a hotel in the Galata Tower area next time. As far as eating establishments: KONAK on strip in the New district .... excellent. Vegetarian, just off the strip near the Funicular, starts with a Ze ... and I must say, Turkish cuisine is often a bit lacking real gourmet qualities so the food was not up to par with france or italy on this trip. Also, GO to the PRINCES ISLANDS for a day trip! This is a great way t spend the afternoon following the hubbub of Istanbul. Also the ferry down the Bosphous was a nice respite with the bus trip back. Again ,,,,,,,,,, the hotel niles was excellent!!!", "Date": "February 23, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "London UK", "Title": "\u201cThis has to be the best Hotel in Istanbul!\u201d", "Author": "docvwLondon", "ReviewID": "UR13600390", "Content": "We chose this Hotel on the basis on reviews on this site.

Breakfast was plentiful, fresh and enjoyable - continental style - no hot breakfast options other than omlette, which suited us, but may be problematic if you need a fry up. No evening meals available but the Kebap shop next door is superb and they will bring plated meals up to the breakfast room in the hotel if you want to eat there.

The Hotel Niles is very near the university, close to the Grand Bazaar and within an easy stroll of all the Sultanahmet attractions. The only negatives I can think of are: The surrounding 50 metres or so are narrow streets that are, perhaps, a little run down. I didn't feel nervous walking down them at night, but perhaps some sole travellers might. The hotel han't got its own generator in the event of power cuts, which aren't at all unknown in Turkey. My first evening was in darkness, though I would have to say that the staff did everything possible to ensure guests were not inconvenienced. The positives have been covered before- I can only repeat and agree with them. The staff, especially Seda (front office manager) were superb, ensuring orientation and enjoyment.

We found this superb hotel on TripAdvsor and it certainly lived up to the promise of all the reviews we read. We arrived at Hotel Niles after a nightmare 12 hour coach journey from Fethiye, and the welcome at the hotel was amazing. Getting to the hotel was a slight problem (see directions at the end) but there were incredibly friendly and helpful people along the way from shop owners to stall holders who pointed us in the right direction. At the desk we were greeted by Seda - she is the front office manager, face of the hotel and worth her weight in gold. When I reserved a room at the hotel through its website she sent me speedy emails and answered all our questions. This excellent service was a pre-taste of what was to follow. As we arrived we were welcomed as valued guests, and were promised an orientation to help us along (it was our first trip to Istanbul). Our room was basic but very clean and comfortable, with an excellent AC unit ,and good shower. There is also a fridge which is useful and the tv has BBC World which kept my bloke happy! We also found it to be very quiet which is exactly what we wanted. As soon as we were ready to go out Seda gave us a map and suggested places to go - she was especially helpful in suggesting when to do things (we wanted to go on a trip down the Bosphorus and Seda explained it would be better to do it before the weekend as it would get busier then). The hotel is literally 2 minutes away from the covered baazar, with the tram station at Beyazit opposite, which is fantastic as you are right in the thick of the old Istanbul places of interest. Sultanahmet (the Blue Mosque) is two stops down on the tram (it costs 1.30TYL) but is also a very easy 10 minute walk away. That evening we were pretty tired so we spent part of the night drinking on the panoramic roofed terrace. It has beautiful views over the Marmara Sea and the service was faultless. The next morning we has breakfast on the same terrace - its a briliant way to wake up with the sun and view and the carrot cake was especially yummy. Breakfast is all healthy - fruit, museli, cheese and veal salami, and home made cakes that were brilliant (did I mention the carrot cake?). In a nut shell I'm not sure you could find better in this area. It is excellent value for money, clean and the friendliest staff you could ask for. We celebrated our 2nd wedding anniversary while we were there, and it was an incredibly special experience. If we return to Istanbul there is no question in our minds where we'd stay. Directions: (to avoid being riped off by a taxi driver!) Head for the Grand Baazar, main entrance opposite the Beyazit tram station. With your back to the baazar cross the road and turn right.

Its location is very good for the Old City and it's close to the tram (a short walk from Beyazit). The poorer features of the hotel are: i) Compact rooms & bathrooms ii) Size of TV and selection of channels in English (basically MTV equivalent and news - I never want to see Rhianna's \"Umbrella-ella-ella video again) But the hotel is in the Old City and space is at a premium. Also, who goes on holiday to watch TV all day? The Aya Sofia is 100s of years older than St Paul's - get out there! Now that those tiny issues are out of the way, let's get to the reasons why you should stay here. i) The free breakfast was basic, but excellent (and buffet-style). Salad stuff; haloumi, regular cheese, sliced processed meat; bread; omlette; melon & watermelon; coffee & cake. ii) The hotel staff really are the friendliest we have ever encountered. Seriously. iii) The rooms may be compact, but they are clean and the air conditioning works - a must during Istanbul's summer! iv) Seda on the front desk has her team well trained and all of them were happy to help us with the smallest detail or request or chat away if it wasn't busy. They also gave us an excellent orientation at the start. v) One of the biggest things for us was that when we put a \"do not disturb\" sign on the door, we weren't disturbed! Now, I've stayed at a fair few hotels in my time and this is literally the first time that this has happened. We were overjoyed at this simple respect shown to guests! So, there's my review.

My daughter and I stayed at the Niles from June 7 - June 26 - we currently hold the record for longest stay! My daughter was a Rotary Exchange student in Istanbul for a year in 2005-2006, so this was our last mom-daughter trip before she leaves for college. It's hard to be original after all the other reviews, but we can certainly reaffirm that the Niles is a great choice for location, cleanliness, friendliness and price. I call it an Oasis because after all the sensory overload of Istanbul, it was wonderful to retreat back to the Niles for a serene escape from the noise, traffic and crowds of a large, active city. The staff is exceptional and will do everything within their power to make your stay comfortable. If you have issues with firm beds, noise or anything else, then ask Seda about the options - they will likely have a solution or recommendation. If you are a light sleeper, as I am, I always travel with my own earplugs to dampen the sounds that come with staying in the heart of a city. The terrace is wonderful and has classical music or light jazz going to add to the atmosphere. It was my favorite place to hang out during the day or evening. The breakfast buffet is delightful and often had special items to add to the selection. Turkish breakfast is pretty consistent - you can expect tomatoes, cheeses, eggs, olives and yogurt, but the Niles offers more than the normal spread. The rooms are small by Western standards, but cleanliness tops size in my book. The room was bright, tasteful and comfortable - with working air conditioning! We felt safe, too. We made good use of the refrigerator by stocking with water from the grocer on the corner. Kemal and his father Osman are very nice, too. The Hotel is in the garment district which is great for clothing, shoe and purse shoppers, but you should also realize that you are in a business district - the grates go up in the morning as people prepare their shops. But you are also very close to the Tram and bus stops, 5 minute walk to Grand Bazaar (which is great sport!) and 10 - 15 minutes to all \"must-sees\" in Sultanahmet. There are no carpet sellers in the immediate area - which is a nice break, but you should also be prepared to be solicited by nearly every store and restaurant you walk past - it's part of the retail culture there. Usually a smile and a no thanks will do - some are more persistent than others. I could go on and on, but that would be beyond the review for this hotel! Overall, we loved our experience. It is clear that the management is striving to create a professional and classy environment without the high prices and the pretension. We certainly got great value for the budget we wanted to spend on lodging. More than that, we met the wonderful people that make up the staff at the NIles. XOX from the Alaskans! I'm happy to provide additional comments to anyone serious about staying here.

It's a small hotel well located in Beyazit district very close to Tram and the major attractions. It's not a luxury hotel but EXTREMLY clean. Yes that's true you hear some noise in the hallway especialy if you're close to the elevator but what you can do, it's human issue especially because of those coming drunk late at night. Anyway if you're looking for a nice, clean, well located and most of all great service and value, this is the one. Also no need to hire a guide in Istanbul. Just when you decide to go somewhere talk to anyone at the recepetion especially Seda, she will give an extremly detailed itinerary with routes, timing, prices and all the tips to make it easy for you.

The woman who works during the day goes above and beyond normal customer service to make sure you figure everything out. My only criticism is the wireless.

The hotel is small and intimate and we have never experienced such warm and hospitable service before. We loved our weeks tour of Istanbul, but it would not have been as memorable if we had not stayed at Hotel Niles. We stayed in a clearly adequate room that was very economical, clean and secure. We ate a lovely complimentary continental spread for breakfast each day with cheeses, fruit, pastries, hard boiled eggs and omelet, yogurt and cereals etc. What makes this hotel so out standing is not the building or the fixtures but the staff. It is run by a small family staff and each is dedicated to the well being of it guests. Seda welcomed us with a guide conversation of our stay. She covered everything a first time visitor to Istanbul might want: advice on where to eat, how to get around without a car, what we should not miss (marking a map of Istanbul with routes, and locations). The Hotel is not in a very pretty part of the city. It is crowded; the streets are narrow; the neighbors are hand labor shops and small stores for the most part. But, the location is very convenient in the heart of the city relatively close to the major downtown attractions of Istanbul and Seda showed us how to get around without taxi or car, by walking short secure routes using the Tram for most city attractions. Seda was available almost every day to answer our questions and make suggestions. The rest of the staff was very helpful as well. Overall I would say this is probably the best hotel staff we have ever encountered on holiday. Perhaps not the most luxurious hotel but, it was newly remodeled, clean, economical and comfortable and the staff made it so that we want to come again to Istanbul and stay at the Hotel Niles.", "Date": "July 4, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "3", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Salt Lake City", "Title": "\u201cGreat place to stay\u201d", "Author": "DaveMcCammon", "ReviewID": "UR8039171", "Content": "Just returned to USA from Turkey.

Seda and the staff really were fantistic. They were so helpful and when we had trouble with our AC they immediately moved us without question and in fact at their insistence. The breakfast on the roof overlooking the city is a great way to start the day. The rooms are just fine but do not expect fancy. The hotel is easy walking distance to just about everything. The only negative is not real close to restaurants but only 6 blocks or so away there are many. My wife and I travel quite a bit on business and use to live in Scotland. For us, Istanbul is at the top for places to visit and for that matter Turkey as a whole. If you go to Istanbul, you really need at least 3 full days to see it. We had 5 full days and were on the go quite a bit. Again, great hotel for value, location, and staff. A couple of unique things about Turkey and Istanbul - dress conservatively men and women, sellers can be very persistent in their efforts but we figured ways to deal with it (Spice Market especially persistent), Istanbul is easy to walk and follow the map but very few street signs, use the car service Seda can set up and not airport taxi, they really do appreciate your efforts to speak some key Turkish words, very friendly people. Favorite restauirants for us (and walking distance to hotel) - Mozaic Cafe, Cozy Terrace (view from roof is fantastic).

We had two rooms and stayed for 10 days. I have to say that the service we received from this hotel was top notch. Seda, who works the front desk most days of the week, speaks very good English and is incredibly helpful. She had excellent suggestions on places to go and things to see, and knows the ins and out of the city so well. She explained things you wouldn't always think of -- whether to take the red bus or the green bus, how to buy access to the tram, etc. She was such a fantastic host. The wait staff (all of whom function as bellboys and handymen, too!) were so nice and remembered what everyone liked. The rooftop deck is very nice, although it can get a bit hot in the middle of the day if you're there in the summer. Part of it is indoors and part outdoors. Breakfast is served there each morning -- breakfast consisted of some pre-made omelets, homemade breads (made by Seda's mom!), hardboiled eggs, some meats and cheeses, cereal, and a few other items. It was quite good. We often hung out there at night, too, for an after dinner drink or two. The first room we had was one with two twin beds. It was on the smaller side, a European type room, but it had a closet and a standup shower, as well as a small tv that got English BBC and CNN. The second room had one queen bed and it had a sitting area that was a bit larger, with a similar bathroom. The rooms are very clean, with a remote-controlled air conditioning unit that works very well. The beds are definitely very firm, so if you like a softer bed this might not be the hotel for you. Overall, I'd HIGHLY recommend the Hotel Niles. The people who run the hotel are wonderful, it's close to many sites and it's very clean and pleasant in the rooms. If you stay at this hotel, I highly recommend a restaurant called \"Sar\". It's at Gedikpaqa Cad. No:43, very close to the hotel. The restaurant has great meze (try the white beans!) and good kebap, and it's pretty inexpensive with great, fun service. Another good restaurant is \"Sahil\" in the Komkapi area -- it's a fish restaurant and has good food and really fun people running the restaurant.

In half an hour we were being warmly welcomed by Seda - one of the most impressive receptionists I have had the pleasure to come across.

Breakfast was well organised and although busy, the food was plentiful and there always seemed to be a table. The view of the Sea of Marmara was a joy and the street scenes from this rooftop endlessly fascinating. The hotel is usefully about 4 minutes from a tram stop. On the road with the trams, follow in the direction of Sultan Ahmet for about 100 metres and turn right down a pedestrianised shopping street. Here you will find the Sar restaurant. This is perfect for a quick salad lunch or more substantial kebabs. (Wine and beer served with a smile!) If you wish for shoes, handbags, leather jackets or briefcases, this is the area to shop.
