We loved the location close to the zocalo, fine arts museum, etc. We were interested in going to Lagunilla open air antique market, so that was a fair walk, but otherwise it was centrally located to most of the places we wanted to see on our short visit. The staff was friendly and helpful, so that made it easier for us to get wherever we wanted to go. The value was there, and there were no untoward surprises. Highly recommended!

The place is clean, if a little noisy (but that's Mexico City), and the staff are friendly and available all night for late arrivals. The staff's lack of English is not a problem, it's my lack of Spanish that causes the confusion, but everything that needed to be dealt with was, save for a small plumbing problem that I hope they dealt with when the room was vacated. The place also has a nice little lounge, a rather expensive and not so great restaurant (but there are lots of other options around) and a tourist service with a very helpful English speaking gentleman in the office. Once he knows you, he is very eager to help with details...he even chased us down the block to clarify things one morning.

Also when we arrived at the hotel Metrepol we did not have a booking, this was the fault of our travel agent. But even though we had no reservation the staff at the hotel gave us a room while they tried to figure out why our agent hadn't sent them an accommodation voucher. Eventually our room was sorted out by the staff at the Metropol, which is not something you'd get at every hotel. Only a couple of staff at the hotel speaks fluent English but this did not cause us any problems. The hotel was basic and slightly dated but clean and comfortable. The room had a TV with a few English channels, a safe ($10 USD deposit required), dressing area, bath and shower. The hotels restaurant was very nice and the prices were low. Although around the corner from the hotel there were quite a few restaurants and a 7/11. The hotel is around 10 minutes walk from Monumento a la Revoluci\u00c3\u00b3n. Located in the lobby of the hotel is a travel office where trips to local attractions can be purchased, we paid $70 USD for two people to go and see the teotihuacan ruins, along with a few stops on the way. I recommend this hotel due to the help we received with our problems and the location.", "Date": "October 28, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Sleep Quality": "1", "Rooms": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Vista, California", "Title": "\u201cAWFUL!!!

The employees are rude beyond belief, they ignore you, look at you like you are dirt. I speak fluent Sapnish and ti was a good thing. They speak no english but that is okay. It is Mexico. Our room was a triple. They advertise refrigerators, microwave, jacuzzi, etc., in all rooms. There is none of this. Our keyed door broke and we had to wait for the concierge to let us in our room when they felt like it. Said we could not change rooms. We changed hotels. I have been here in DF manyu times and this is the only hotel I found rude employees. They are not just rude they are freaks!! Wireless internet gets turned off at 10 PM just because they want too. They turn it back on if you yell but only after 8 in the morning when the chief grosero goes home. Kind of a bad neighborhood butt it is 2 blocks from Alameda.

The walls are paper thin but the accommodations are just fine. It is certainly a good bang for the buck. The hotel lobby is lovely, offering a lot of local marble and artwork. There are two elevators that service the 160 rooms, but they are TINY. Three of us with a suitcase each was too much! The rooms provided us with a king size bed, a beautifully large bathroom (GREAT WATER PRESSURE) and good lighting. There was NO airconditioning, and that was a little disturbing considering it was in the high 80's during the day and the high 70's at night. The restaurant was good, but not great. The food was simple, but they tried to make it elegant. The prices weren't bad, but the quality wasn't great. The breakfast buffet was a nice treat, (included with our room fee). The coffee was some of the best I've ever had in my life, and as a traveler through much of South and Central America, I know my coffee!!!! The staff was incredible. Very nice, they spoke a good broken english, and were always willing to smile and giggle!

Hovever, the service is great and the restaurant serves good food. The bar is ok - only one bartender - not many varieties, and imported liquor is very expensive as with all places in Mexico.
