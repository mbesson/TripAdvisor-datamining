{"Reviews": [{"Content": "A Surprisingly Nice Hotel I recently went on vacation to Seattle last week and stayed at the University Hotel, which I book on Expedia for $129/night. The University Hotel was surprisingly a lot nicer than I thought it was going to be and the hotel staff were very friendly and professional. We checked in at around 1 a.m. and the front desk staff was surprisingly very pleasant at such a late hour. The decor reminded me a lot of what you would find in a Kimpton Hotel and had a boutique feel. Unfortunately the location is not all that great if you do not have a car with you and want to be in downtown Seattle; although the drive is only about 5 minutes. There is however a bus stop a block away you can take downtown. Also another great thing about the University Hotel is that they have a binder filled with take-out menus, from which you can order from local eateries and have it delivered to your room to satisfy whatever cuisine you crave.I would definitely recommend the University Hotel for the great rate I got, which I think is a lot nicer than a hotel you would get at $129/night in downtown Seattle. The rooms were very comfortable and clean with a boutique feel; they also come with a refridgerator and microwave.", "Date": "May 24, 2006", "ReviewID": "UR607185920", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "4", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member"}], "HotelInfo": {"HotelURL": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g60878-d123013-r5207960-University_Hotel-Seattle_Washington.html", "HotelID": "123013", "Price": "$95"}}
