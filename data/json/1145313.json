I stayed there twice on my recent trip to Italy and it was an excellent experience. To begin, the hotel is located in the Trastevere area of Rome. The area felt very safe since we took long walks at night without feeling uncomfortable or threatened. It is located however a little far from the touristic attraction nevertheless it is easy to reach center city since the hotel provides a free shuttle and the bus stop in not too far away. I found it very convenient to ride the bus (line 170) because it takes you to the Trastevere train station and also goes thru the mayor attractions of the city. The final stop takes you to the central train station (TERMINI) and the ride is only 1 Euro. It also rides nonstop until mid-night which makes it even better. To reach the hotel you can ride the train from the airport to the Trastevere train station for 8 Euros or use one of the shuttle services that take you from the airport to the hotel doors for 10 Euros per person. We chose the second option since we had bags and didn\u2019t want to venture on the train. Also the hotel is about 15 min walk to the train station and a cab ride cost about 8 Euros so it makes sense to take the paid shuttles. Check in was quick and the facilities are incredible. Very comfortable rooms with WIFI and mini bar. It has a beautiful roof top pool that was closed during our stay but I imagine is extremely cool to use once it opens. We loved the breakfast because it had a lot of different options and it was an excellent source of fuel before the long walks in Rome. The staff is very attentive and friendly. They have a cool bar with late night snacks and a good selection of drinks. CLAUDIO, the hotel bartender was very personable and helpful; he remembered our choice of drinks even after a week after our first visit. He provided us with the best service by far in Rome. Overall I recommend this hotel to anyone who doesn\u2019t want to be in the middle of the city and inundated by tourists. It will certainly be my hotel of choice for my next trip to Rome.", "Date": "April 13, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Hemel Hempstead, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cReal Rome\u201d", "Author": "ILoveGoodCustServ", "ReviewID": "UR127766279", "Content": "Stayed here twice, the 2nd time was as part of honeymoon!..could just end the review there I suppose. Its not in the heart of the city, but as long as you are reasonably fit that's a good thing as a half hour walk to town you get a good feel for town, and there are plenty of other options for transport. I prefer being out of central Rome as although its fascinating it is the cliched part of the city and you won't see much in the way of real Italian life. Not so near the H10..its a pleasure to find local bars and restaurants nearby, eating al fresco with the locals, then rounding off with a trip to the gelateria with 100 ice cream flavours!

The hotel is located in a quiet neighborhood, away from public transportation, and outside the tourist area. We were told there is a bus stop several blocks away, but did not look for it b/c it seemed a waste of precious time to get directions, walk several blocks, wait for the bus, then figure out how to pay, get off at the correct stops, and find the correct bus to return. Taxis here are fairly inexpensive, and our eight people knew we could double up four to a car. Guests here ranged from honeymooners to senior citizens, all very friendly and quiet. The room was a $40.00 U.S. Dollar upgrade from the standard $100.00 room, for a total of $140.00. The upgrade cost was for a better bathroom and a larger room in a better location. The location on the fourth floor was nice, overlooking what I think was a soccer field, but very quiet and peaceful, even when there were people playing on the grassy field. Front desk personnel were attentive, smiling, friendly, talkative, generous with maps, willing to telephone tour operators at the places where the hotel gets a commission. They worked hard at upselling the hotel's amenities. The room was sparkling clean, pristine in fact! We had a nice large window that opened to catch the evening breeze. The room had decent size desktop- about four feet long, a combination safe in a cabinet with shelves, two tiny night stands with good reading lamps, and a sliding-door closet with room for a chest-level shelf for placing a large suitcase. There was a small chair in a corner, and a chair at the desk. The floors were spankin' clean hardwood. The bed covering and linens were fresh, crispy soft, and quite inviting. The room was tiny. The bathroom was beautifully appointed, very attractive to look at, all white and shiny clean pewter/aluminum; but just plain awful to use. Not one speck of countertop space for cosmetics. I'll never understand why hotels install the very inhospitable arrangement of pedestal sinks with zero user-friendly countertop space for personal belongings. I need space for makeup, cologne, special soaps, hair care items, pills, contact lens supplies, water bottle; and then there's my partner's stuff! The hair dryer hung on the wall, and there was no countertop to lay it on for easy pickup and put-down; I had to keep wrestling it back into its metal hanger in between brushing and drying my hair. The swinging glass half-door did not keep water in the tub, but it was nice looking and very clean. There was a mostly used roll of toilet paper and a very tiny wrapped spare; no tissues, and of course, in the European fashion, no face washcloths. Not happy with that arrangement, b/c who wants to pack up a semi-wet washcloth after showering on departure day? So very difficult to use this bathroom. The room had a window that opened & the breeze was wonderful, very pleasant in cool weather. This was a good room for relaxing after a long day, reading in the very comfortable bed with a good reading lamp. A couple with whom we were traveling had a suite, and it was huge by comparison; with a coffee maker, two televisions, and other amenities - worth considering. The restaurant and bar/snack area was enormously expensive for mundane food. $5.00 (over 3 Euros) for a tiny size glass bottle of cola, for example. That's simply gouging! However, the snack area was very comfortable, with an attractive bar, reasonably attentive service, and a good place for groups to meet casually to catch up on daily activities. Off to the side of the bar is a lobby lounge with large, comfortable chairs. The front desk person gives out free passwords to use the computers in this lobby area, but each time I used the computers the code was not even necessary. Internet was fast, computers were not in high demand, and the computer experience was good. The front desk staff - two different people at two different times for members of our party - told us there was no place to go nearby for coffee or breakfast other than the hotel restaurant which also serves full dinners. They even told two members of our group to wait 35 minutes until the restaurant opened, b/c there was no place nearby for coffee. Not true. Just 1 1/2 block away, around the corner behind the hotel, was a wonderful bakery and coffee shop. The coffee shop also served lunch and light dinners. The day we found the place they were serving delicious hot panini-like sandwiches; and of course delicious fresh pastries. The price was downright cheap, even by American standards. Breakfast at the hotel for our two unfortunate group members was $35.00 American - all b/c the front desk person told them there was no other option! Just a couple blocks more behind the hotel - a total of about three blocks - is Marconi, a fairly busy street, but definitely very far south of the interesting commercial area. And wonderfully --- there is a grocery market which is just three blocks from the hotel. It's a full market, like a small Kroger store, and groceries were reasonably priced. I suppose that's b/c it's away from the tourist area. For example, we bought an 8-pack of American Coca Cola for around $7.00 American. We also bought 8-packs of bottled water there, as the cost at the hotel was about $4.00 per small bottle. The free morning shuttle takes people into town, but fills up quickly and there seemed to be only one bus - by late morning we were told the shuttle had already left, and that there would not be another one. And... had we taken the shuttle, there was no option whatever for catching the shuttle back to the hotel. Once in town, you're on your own. So we called a taxi, and with four people per taxi, the cost was an inexpensive per-person cost, just under $20.00 American to the city. On our next rides to town we found that most destinations, such as the Collosseum, Vatican, and the main squares all were about the same cost. If wanting to use the hotel's free shuttle, I suppose it's best to inquire the evening prior, ask if it's possible to reserve seats, and if not... be early to get a seat. Bottom line: Spotlessly clean, bad location, tiny room, friendly front desk.", "Date": "March 6, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "London, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cLovely hotel, great price, out of town location.\u201d", "Author": "EmilyH25", "ReviewID": "UR125694144", "Content": "This is a lovely 4* hotel.

This service went at very convenient times and we never missed a bus! This hotel is a really great price compared to others of this quality in Rome due to the out of town location. We found the only downside of the location was in the evenings when we wanted to visit the lovely restaurants in central Trastevere. This was a 45 minute walk or a 12 euro taxi. The front desk were very informative and upon arrival provided us with maps, tour information and gave us tips on the best places to visit. All the staff were really helpful.

Every member of staff we encountered was more than pleasant and helpful. Our flight was not until evening, so we opted to leave our luggage in the hotels left luggage and return to the hotel and have a taxi take us from there to ciampino airport just what we needed. Nothing was a problem, so much so my daughters both said the hotel was just getting better and better!!! The area where the hotel is called Trastevere is an amazing town,no metro, however it has a train station, a good walk from the hotel. The restaurants locally were great. One called retro just around the corner from hotel and the other we found was rosa mosquita across the main road to the left of the hotel.

When we arrived (3 night stay) we were informed that the wifi was not working. I'd purposely not bothered with any guidebooks to Rome, as I was going to research everything on the web. By the following day, it was still not working. And only on the last day, in the afternoon, did they get the internet working. This was really disappointing, and we were offered no compensation. The breakfast was also not too great. I admit that there was a lot of choice, but nothing looked very appetising. Everything appeared to be dried out, or overcooked. The boiled eggs were boiled until blue. The bacon was undercooked and too thin. On one morning, the fruit looked like it was just too ripe, with grapes starting to turn brown. The meat cuts and cheese slices were OK but very ordinary. Cereals were OK. There were about 4 to choose from. As I said, there was a lot of choice, but some more effort could've been done with presentation and quality of the food. I know I'm being really picky, it's just that for the money, and for the rating it got on Trip Advisor, I was just a little bit disappointed. On two of the days, the lifts on our side of the building were not working. Not a disaster by any means.... but just giving the facts. The hotel was situated slightly further from the centre than i imagined... about a 12 minute walk from Roma Trastevere station. Now that I've done the moaning bit... I will also add that the staff were very welcoming and friendly, in the reception, in the breakfast hall, and the chamber staff. The room was quite large, and the bathroom was really perfect: Large, clean, bright, and white. Shower pressure was very good. The beds were comfy and there were extra pillows provided. Loads of wardrobe space, and a safe was provided. The mini bar was good, and the prices were reasonable, as far as hotel mini-bar prices go. Also, they had a free shuttle taking guests to the centre of town several times per morning, and a few times return in the afternoon, so the distance need not be a great problem.

The room was really nice and we found that room service was actually quite good value we got a big plate of chips, some pizza and pasta and some free bread buns (you do have to pay about \u20ac5 for the luxury though) There is also a fridge in the room (for the mini bar) - but if you find a cheapish shop and buy some water you might as well just store it in the fridge yourself. There is a shuttle bus that we caught that runs into Rome from the hotel - it only has 16 seats so if you can't get on there is a bus stop at the end of the road (turn right out of the hotel and walk about 100m and then turn right again until you get to the main street - about 250 meters away - then turn right again and walk until you see the bus stop ) i forget which bus you need to take but the hotel tell you this on arrival and give you maps etc. We also found a much cheaper way of getting back to Fiumicino Airport - we caught the bus to the train station and then just got the train right into the airport - we didn't have to buy train tickets before hand and no one asked us on the train so we basically got a free ride and saved about \u20ac50 on a taxi (that's what it cost us on the way down) - if we went again we would take a train and bus to get to the hotel in the first place as this would save lots of money. If you can get breakfast included then we would recommend this - it was so good! there was so much choice.

You can take the hotel shuttle, that runs four or five times a day (and returns four or five times), or go to the #170 bus stop at the top of the street, which will bring you into center Rome, or call a taxi. Having said that, I should also add that the hotel is in a wonderful neighborhood. All along Viale D. Marconi there are nice shops, patiserries, trattoria, banks, etc. and I enjoyed being centered in a non-tourist area. Tripadvisor's #9 rated restaurant in all of Rome is a block away (Osteria Mavi) and you are with walking distance to Piccolo Borgo, a great family-oriented trattoria that is well worth seeking out. If you can see advantages being off the beaten tourist track, try it. If you want to walk out the door and be in the center of things, look elsewhere. The hotel itself is great. We had a good sized room, very comfortAble bed and pillows, a terrific shower, in-room safe that was easy to use, a mini bar that you could put your own drinks in as well as those supplied. Nice flatscreen TV, with only 2 channels in English, but hey.... you get to watch old Clint Eastwood movies in Italian! I have travelled a lot, and this is one of the cleanest hotels I have ever visited. The entire place is spotless. The rooms themselves, bathrooms in-room and off the lobby, the dining room, even the elevators are spotless. Very nice. The front desk staff was very helpful. There is no separate concierge desk, so once or twice I had to wait til the desk staff finished checking someone in, but they were excellent. making dinner reservations and suggestions, calling taxis,making change, showing me the most efficient bus route to a museum, even calling to make a reservation for me at a museum. We ate one night in the hotel restaurant, which was certainly adequate for a night we didn't want to go out again- a good steak and nicely done duck, lots of seafood choices...but there are better and more interesting places to eat. I thought the breakfasts were great. A few kinds of eggs, cold cuts and cheeses, fresh fruit, juices, yogurts and cereals, just a nicely done breakfast buffet. We got breakfast as part of our conference room rate, and I suggest trying to get it included with your room. By itself, I think the charge was 17\u20ac per person, which seems a little high. There is a very good rooftop exercise room, massage spa and terrific rooftop swimming pool, which was excellent until yesterday (Sept. 28) when they closed it for the season til June. I was disappointed to find it closed, but glad I had gone for a swim earlier in the week, at least. In the lobby are several computers in a relaxing area for guest use. Wifi at the hotel worked very well. There is a bar area in the lobby where you can get drinks, coffee, salad or sandwiches during the day, though the dining room itself does not open for lunch. So as a functioning place to stay, I would call this an excellent hotel, if you are aware of its location and willing to be out of the center Rome area.

The hotel is located approx. 5km to the south of central Rome. A shuttle bus is provided however this only runs once per hour and is apparently quite small so gets full very quickly. We decided not to rely on it so used the normal bus service instead. This is cheap and takes around 30 mins to get to the centre. We also got a bus to the nearest Metro station which took us to the colosseum quite quickly. There is very little of interest in the local area. We found one restaurant which was pretty good - on the main road called Retro - but otherwise there was not much around so you are best advised to eat in the city centre. We drove to the hotel and used their onsite parking which was 12 EUR. There did seem to be a few free parking spaces on the streets nearby though. The hotel looks very nice and is very modern and stylish. There seem to be a few oversights in the design though. For example, the bathroom looks great and ours had 2 showers however there was nowhere to hang used bath towels. Also, there is an ADSL connection in the room which was great but there was nowhere near it to sit and use a laptop. Our standard double room was OK. It was a little small for the two of us but not too bad. The bed was very comfortable. The bathroom was large and had a great shower though some things in the bathroom seemed to have been installed by someone about 4 inches taller than me judging by the height that the mirror and toilet were installed at. Free wireless internet was provided in the room however this was very patchy with a reasonable signal only by the door to our room. Luckily, I had a laptop with me and managed to get the ADSL connection to work. To connect to the hotel network, you need to get a userid and password which is provided by reception and you need to login every time you use it which can get a bit annoying. There is a \"business centre\" on the ground floor however this seemed to consist of 4 old Dell computers with low res screens which when I was there were always being used by kids checking their Facebook status. I wanted to print out a couple of documents but there was no printer available. I was told that I would have to email the documents to reception and they would print them for me. Luckily, the documents were not confidential so this was OK for me however if I had been staying there on business, this would have been totally unacceptable. Breakfast is charged at 17EUR if it is not included in your room rate. For this price, we expected something pretty special. But it was just average.There was a reasonable selection of hot and cold food available but the quality was just average. We were also not keen on the room that breakfast was served in as it had the feeling of a canteen. As the breakfast was a bit of a disappointment, we decided not to try the restaurant in the evening. The pool on the roof is very nice to cool off in on a hot day however it is very small - less than 10m I think - so don't expect to be able to swim for a long time in it unless you want to know what a goldfish in a small bowl feels like. Service at the hotel was average at best. Most of the staff would say \"Buon giorno\" when seeing us however this had the feeling that they had been told to say it rather than of genuine warmth. This was also true when we checked in and the receptionist asked how our flight was but totally ignored the answer - we were driving not flying. When we tried the breakfast, the service was very brusque. The worst example of the service though was when we asked if it would be possible to get a kettle for our room. It was a little disappointing that the room didn't have one - but not too unusual for Italy - and we hoped that reception might be able to help us out. However they couldn't and rather than being told \"I am sorry, we cant provide one\" we were told \"You can't have one. It is a security risk.\". This particularly annoyed my partner who has a very low tolerance for BS and coloured her view of the hotel for the rest of the stay. The hotel is supposed to be a 4* hotel and for what we paid, we felt that it was very mediocre.

They do have wi-fi but we didn't bring a laptop, so were pleasantly surprised to find four computers with internet in the lobby for everyone to use. It is a little outside of the main part of the city, but getting to the sites wasn't an issue; we purchased a Roma Pass which included city transportation for 3 days and used both the city buses and metro, as well as the free shuttle to and from the hotel when possible. I actually really liked the neighbourhood that the hotel was in. It was neat to see a different part of Rome. There is a school, playground and several grocery stores nearby (rare in Rome!). There did seem to be some maintenance issues but I guess that is because much of the city is shut down for August. As others have mentioned - the revolving doors were broken (not really an issue because there were 2 others) and there was a large leak in the lobby which was weird. It was extremely hot this past week, so the air conditioning was a MUST! We only used the pool twice, but it is very nice. It was crowded once, but the second time we were the only people there. The breakfast is fantastic (as long as it's included for free). For lunch/dinner you are somewhat limited if you are at the hotel; I would recommend eating in the city centre. Room service was okay (but they add on a $4-5 charge each time so beware) and we did that a couple of times. The hotel restaurant only offers a buffet dinner beginning at 7:30pm, and this ranges in price from $20-30 per person. I found the staff extremely helpful.

Roberto. P was very helpful!\u201d", "Author": "Paulo_49", "ReviewID": "UR117027394", "Content": "After reading reviews on a number of hotels in Rome, I decided to choose the H10 Roma Citta for numerous reasons. We used the hotel for a 4 night stay in Rome, for a surprise trip for me and my girlfriend, on the dates 12th-16th August. The hotel is not in the centre of Rome itself, but is only a 10 minute bus journey from the centre. The 170 bus runs regularly from 5:30am until midnight, therefore there is no problem with getting back to the hotel, unless you are slightly unlucky to be in Rome when there are some diversions happening which causes the bus to miss a couple of the normal bus stops (which we discovered one night) , however, you- can simply go to the Termini, where you can catch the bus from, if this does happen. simple enough. The hotel does run a shuttle bus which ends at 7:30pm every day, so if you didnt want to use the public transport or a taxi, you would have to get back on this, and then enjoy the rest of your night in the hotel, or surrounding area, which when in Rome seems a bit of a silly thing to do. The hotel itself has a very modern and clean interior, which is very pleasing to the eye when you arrive, and throughout the duration of your stay. The only problem we had with our room was that our safe was not working, however someone did come to fix it but did not return, however, I think this may be because he said he would be back in 15 minutes but we had to leave, so he may not have been able to get back in, otherwise, the rooms were very nice, and the bath room was more of a wetroom than having a seperate shower, which me and my girlfriend thought was a nice touch, especially as it had two showers. The pool on the roof is slightly smaller than expected and is quite cold, but it is still a very nice addition to the hotel, as not many hotels near the centre of Rome have a swimming pool. The seating around the pool area can get a bit cramped, as there are a limited number of sun beds to say the least, but we always managed to find somewhere to set down our towels and sunbathe on the occasions that we did. The bar on the roof was also a nice addition and they do a selection of drinks, however it was a lot smaller than expected, and the downstairs bar seemed to be rarely open. I think this may have been due to the bar tender arriving at a certain time of day. Staff at Roma Citta, were always very willing to help, and would do there best to provide you with the best answer possible. Roberto P was particulary helpful with helping us find the quickest route to the Hydromaina waterpark, and for finding restaurants and cocktail bars in rome. He recommended us a cocktail bar in Trastevere called Express cocktail bar which was unfortunately closed. Breakfast was superb, there was a huge selection, and it set us up for each day to do whatever we had planned. However, the only flaw with the food at the hotel was that there was not as much choice at dinner. On our arrival we were hungry and went to the restaurant downstairs and discovered they only dfid a buffett. this is the only thing I would change, however, I would usually prefer to go find a local restuarant than eat in a hotel. The number of restaurants in the local area are quite few, unless you search around for them, or ask a member of hotel staff to point them out to you (which is what we did, and they were very willing to do so). The downfall is that most of the hotels in the local area only have italian menus or speak very little english (but I think this is part of the fun of going to a foreign country, to learn and do things like that) . However, we stumbled across a restaurant called AR VOLO, which although had everything in italian, did their best to get someone to translate the menu for us, and explain certain dishes. They also do an excellent seafood fettucini! All-in-all, the hotel was an excellent place to stay, and the transportation system into, and back from the centre was good enough to mean that the location of the hotel being slightly further out was not a problem at all.

When you exit the station you can catch either the 170 or 766 bus at a cost of 1 euro each (you buy this ticket from the machine by the bus bays or some buses have them on board) You stay on this bus for 3 stops and get off at the stop 'Marconi' walk along til you reach the music shop, then cross the road keep walking down the side street past the pizza place and news stand and then take a left and you are at the hotel. The breakfast was good and had a good choice. The rooms were very modern and clean. The pool is on the roof and is small and there are not many sunbeds. Remember the tourist tax is 3 euro per night per person! They do provide a free shuttle bus at certain times we never used this as the bus stop is close and is only 1 euro valid for 75 minutes. The Tram station is also near the bus station and this is also 1 euro! At times these were overly crowded and we could not reach the machines on the bus/tram to pay so we did have several free rides as no one seems to check your tickets anyway. Someone told us only catch white taxis but we are not sure why as we never used taxis. We did eat in 'Pizza Retro' near hotel which was nice, this is near the sweet stand on the main road, the entrance is located down the side. The cheapest store we found for water and groceries was 'Eurospin' located next on the side street on way to hotel next to the pizza place, its easy to miss.", "Date": "August 12, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Athens,Greece", "Title": "\u201cValue for Money\u201d", "Author": "Greek_sunseeker", "ReviewID": "UR116602709", "Content": "Nice hotel ,close to the center.We booked 4 standard double rooms between July 20-22 and we were very pleased.

Hotel also provides ice cubes for free (functioning machine not at every floor, I had to go to another floor...) which was nice in summertime. We also ate breakfast there and it was okey.

The bathroom was quite nice with plenty of room - nice mirror and there is a proper hair dryer. Nice fittings throughout.

We tried it and found it was very bland and not very good value - the waiter was very nice though - great service. We couldn't fault the service at any time at the hotel, by any of the staff. All are pleasant and attentive. Main draw back, as stated by others, is the distance from the centre of Rome. There was a shuttle bus and this was always full in the mornings, but the hotel was quite busy and there are only 16 seats. If staying for more than a couple of days the buses are very frequent and are nearby and although always packed they are easy to get on/off.

The cleanliness of the rooms is fantastic and all the staff work was much appreciated. The front desk employees were pleasant, friendly and multilingual, which is convenient for visitors who don't speak neither English or Italian. The area in which the hotel is located is not at all touristic, so if you don't speak any Italian, it's practically impossible to purchase even pizza.

It was a great hotel, very-very clean, with very polite staff and extremely helpful! When we reached the hotel by taxi from Fumicino(39 euros) we were given maps of the city, which we used a lot! The first morning, we used the hotel shuttle service and reached the centre of the city(near piazza Venezia). The other days we used bus no 170 which was very convenient, because was close enough to hotel and went to piazza venezia. If u get out of hotel, u turn right to the end of the road, then right again to the end of via pietro blaserna and the then right to viale marconi and outside the pizzeria Retro(nice food,good prices) is the stop of 170! (about 6-7 mins walk). After u get out in piazza venezia, if u like wallking u can reach on foot all major monuments(colosseo, fontana di trevi, piazza di spagna,piazza del popolo, pantheon). We did it but its important to know that u have to make small breaks because the heat is much in summer! IAt nights we liked a lot to visit Trastevere, a traditional neighborhood with lots of bars and restaurants! If u want to get there u have to take buses no 170 or 766 and get off in stagione trastevere(its only 5 mins away). Then u take the tram no 8 with same ticket(1 euro) and get off in trastevere. Most of people get off there so its easy to know your stop. The reservation we did was no breakfast because we dont like to be pressed by timetables, so we used cafe amadei in via pietro blaserna in your right hand(5 mins on foot by hotel). There, we ordered cappucino, pastries and sandwiches for 2 persons, only 7 euros!!! The clerck there is very polite! we recommend that! When we left we took bus no 170, got off in stagione trastevere and took the train to fiumicino for only 8 euros. The destination is about 30 mins from the train station. If u want to avoid expensive taxis, we recommend that. Its easy and cheap way. Overall, our trip was excellent, the hotel quiet and comfortable and location for us was not a problem.

Getting to the hotel from Trastervere Railway Station was a bit of a nightmare as we were directed on to the wrong bus and ended up heading back to the airport! Fortunately no one checks your tickets (we didn't have one) so we managed to get back and get the correct bus at no charge! When you come out of the station you must get the 170 heading to Marconi, 3 stops and then get off (by the large book/record shop). Hotel was a few minutes walk from the bus stop. Cross over the busy road (Footlocker on corner), past school and then left. Hotel is easily visible. Check-in was easy and pleasant and the staff were helpful with explaining the transport system. The room was very clean, modern, stylish bathroom with great shower, comfy bed, safe, etc. Very pleased. Buffet breakfast was included which had a great selection and all very tasty. We didn't eat in the restaurant or have a drink at the lobby bar because we were out and about for most of the days and evenings. Did get to use the roof top pool which again was clean with comfortable loungers and a great place to chill out. Would definitely recommend this hotel to others but here's a few tips to make getting about easier. The hotel provides a free shuttle bus several times to and from the city centre but the 170 bus is very frequent. We bought a Roma Pass which entitled us to get into 2 sites/attractions free and then discount on many others plus free travel on the buses, trams, subway and urban trains for 3 days. Worked out great value for money, especially if you pick 2 of the most expensive sites to visit FIRST (do read the small print). We did the Colosseum and Roman Forum and then found we also got into St Angelo's Castle free too (might have been a fluke). You can get the train from Trastervere to the St Peter's for the Vatican (1 stop) which is simple but be aware of last times for all modes of transport as bizarrely nothing seems to run overly late! Some of the buses have a electronic display on them so you can see where you are but a handy tip is that on the bus stops you will see the areas listed with a number next to them, the number dictates how many bus stops in that area. We found this quite useful on those that didn't have the screen as it gave us a good idea of where to get off by counting how many times we stopped. 170 bus pretty much got us everywhere and then it's good to walk between sites such as the Spanish Steps, Trevi Fountain, Pantheon, etc as the cobbled side streets are very quaint and sometimes have market stalls and great little shops and cafes. As for eating out, we tried Angelo's just down from the entrance to the Vatican Museum and it was awful. That's one to avoid. Hard Rock Cafe was really pricey for drinks but great atmosphere and food. Caught the subway home to Marconi but then it's a good 20 mins from the station but had no choice as it was late. Also ate near Piazza Venezia where the food was much nicer and the local street vendors do a nice slice of pizza and warm sandwiches in this area during the day. All in all we had a great time in Rome.

The local 170 bus was also a great alternative to getting back or going into the city in your own time frame.The local bus is only 1euro each way...very cheap!!!! The city is easy to get around and the sights are truly amazing.

The closest metro bus access is the 170 bus that takes you directly to the centre of Rome in about 20 minutes. The cost of bus is 1 euro but honestly, we saw absolutely no one pay the fare. I assume the 75 mins validation period is being used via the honour system but no one ever checked during my 3 nights there so don't buy the Roma Pass for 25 euros if you really don't need to as it does not include the Vatican Museum and only worth it for subway system use and the subway does not take you to everywhere. However, you should go on the city sightseeing tour on the red double decker bus as they hit up all major routes and runs until around 6pm. It's easier than you trying to find your own way around if you do not like being lost as the subway is not very intuitive and lacks signage. The hotel has shuttle buses going to the colosseum area every hour or so with last bus back to the hotel at 7pm. We used public transit and not the shuttle as the main road for bus is about 5 mins walk from the hotel and the buses were pretty frequent with the last bus towards the hotel around 12am. Note that the subway closes at 9pm until mid 2012 right now in Rome. Also note that the public buses do not have AC and seats are very minimal! We upgraded to the superior room upon arrival for 20 euros more a day for the 3 nights. We were hoping for free upgrade but did not bother arguing as we were exhausted. The only difference between the standard and superior seemed to be the size (roomier in superior) and some complicated expresso kit that can be uses with the expresso machine in the room. I say stick with standard and no need for upgrade as the modern decor is consistent on both rooms. The washroom was standard size and the bed was pretty comfortable. The curtains were very effective and the windows were very sound proof! There was a lot of music outside our room during our stay but we did not hear the music unless we opened the door! They have facilities such as a pool and fitness room and spa but we were in Rome to sightsee so we did not have to use the facilities. The housekeeping was mediocre as they did not properly replenish the toiletries for 3 days straight. We had to request for additional soap bc the maid did not replace it for our entire stay and since the soap was small, we used it ALL up on our second night! Other aspects of housekeeping was fine. I really appreciated the modern decor of the room and the hallways as I always looked forward to having a peaceful rest after a long day exploring Rome. There is also a supermarket on the main street right beside the bus stop if you want to pick up any snacks or water for the room. The area seemed very safe even late at night and there are some stores around if you want to have a stroll in the neighborhood. Overall, we really enjoyed the clean and modern room but the location was not the best.

Average cab fare was 15 Euros (with and, sometimes, without tip) from any attraction point to the hotel. I would recommend taking a business card with the hotel's address - from there cabbies are quick and savvy in getting you back. The only sticking point was the food service. Despite what the information sheet indicated, there is no breakfast room service. Breakfast buffet (30 Euros per person) was not worth it. As we were ill at this point on our trip, half baked bacon and runny eggs were not appealing. If planning to dine in the hotel, I would recommend the \"bed and breakfast\" package.

We previously thought about renting an apartment in the city for our time here, but after hours of searching we could not find anything that rivalled the excellent and modern facilities of this hotel! As people have said before the only downside is that the hotel is slightly out of the way (ten minutes on the bus) which we were fully aware of before we booked and decided that is was a compromise we were willing to make and can safely say that it was not a problem for us during our stay. The rooftop terrace and terrace bar is relatively small and only has a handful of loungers, but there is also some space to lay on the decking whilst waiting for them to become available. The swimming pool and hot tub were great (albeit they are remarkably cold - almost unbelievably cold!), however it is well worth braving the initial shock as you soon get used to it. The bar prices were very reasonable, the rooms stylish with extremely comfortable beds, the staff were very friendly and were more than happy to help with any local/tourist information you may need. Also the free wireless & wired internet was an excellent facility, it's a shame more places don't offer it as a standard.

Yes, it is a little way out of the city but for that you get less traffic noise and can retreat from Summer heat. Yes, it lacks the character of the traditional buildings closer to the city centre, but then you can have a modern air-conditioned room and the benefits of a rooftop pool. The bus ride to the city centre didn't take too long and the bus stop was only at the end of the road. If you like to see a bit of life beyond the tourist circuit, then travelling on buses is one way of doing it. The pool was a definite plus as the temperatures outside soared to 35C. It was lovely to have somewhere to cool off and relax. They could do with a few more chairs/loungers, but that's a minor detail. The staff were very helpful and spoke excellent English. I got a very good room rate after shopping around and it included breakfast, which we found to be pretty good. I don't know that I would have been prepared to pay an additional breakfast rate, especially with a Spar supermarket within 5 minutes' walk of the hotel, and other supermarkets not far away. I did have the evening buffet on the first evening because it was fairly late and I didn't feel like searching for somewhere. This is my only real criticism - I found it to be overpriced and not a great variety or quality of food. There are some excellent local restaurants in the road parallel to the hotel (Pepe Rosso and the one next to it, particularly; Glamour Cafe was ok but not quite so good) and a wonderful gelataria on the main road just a little further south (banana ice cream was amazing). Try those - the food is great, service attentive and plenty of people-watching opportunities. Much better than the touristy restaurants in the city. As other reviewers have said, the rooms are very comfortable. We did have one disrupted night when a coachload of over-excited German teenagers decided it was fun to run along the corridors shouting, but that was a one-off. In conclusion, if you want to stay somewhere reasonably-priced in Rome, you have to make some compromises. We thought this hotel was very good value and helped to make our stay relaxing as well as interesting.

There are a limited number of sun beds, but we never had a problem getting one. The hotel also offered a gym which I used a few times. The hotel offers free internet/wifi and has computers located in the bar/lounge area. We did not try the restaurant in the hotel as we ate in Santa Maria in Trastevere. This was a short taxi ride away and has plenty of lovely places to eat. Gino\u2019s in particular, was amazing, and reasonably priced. The only fault we could find with this hotel was that it was not right on top of the sights. However, this was not a problem for us, and it was nice to come away from the busy center. The free shuttle service, and good public transport links, made it easy to reach the sights. Top class hotel, will defiantly return.", "Date": "October 21, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Midwest", "Title": "\u201cDon't miss this one if you are staying in Rome\u201d", "Author": "MidwestTony1969", "ReviewID": "UR47162090", "Content": "I just got back from my 4 night stay at this hotel. Overall, I thought it was a good hotel. They did have a couple of issues that were a bit upsetting but not enough to ruin my trip. First, the hotel is in a residential area and not near the tourist attractions, but they are accesible via the hotel shuttle (which I used a couple of times) and also the #170 bus which is about a 5 minute walk from the hotel door. The hotel is off the main road and next to a school and outdoor sports complex. The area is a bit gritty but then again, I thought the whole city was...in other words, lots of graffiti, etc., but at no time did I feel unsafe walking to/from the hotel...and don't kid yourself, if you stay here, you will be doing lots of walking. The hotel was impeccably clean. I was very impressed with the size of the room and the cleanliness. You could literally eat off the floor, anywhere in the hotel. The bathrooms were like something out of a magazine. If you stay here, you'll know what what I mean. The downside - the advertised free wi-fi did not work. I complained several times but was told it happens, depending on where your room is. I personally think that is unacceptable. My room was at the end of the hallway but in today's technological age, they could easily fix this by boosting the signal throughout the hotel. They apparenlty chose not to. If you are staying here for leisure like I did, not a huge problem but it is inconvenient. I couldn't even get online in my room with a wired connection, but they do have free computer access on their lobby computers 24 hours a day...if you are staying for business, you may want to reconsider to a hotel that can guarantee internet. Again, I think they really need to fix this...it's something I read about in other reviews and prepared myself for before arriving. The next thing is the hotel gym...again, it was a disappointment. From day to day the 3 machines in the room (very small room) moved around from one room to another...they claim they were remodeling but with the amount of equipment and size of the room I failed to see what they were trying to accomplish. Luckily, I did so much walking with sightseeing that the gym didn't become much of an issue. The gym and the internet were about the only complaints I have for this hotel...the value is good. If arriving by the train from the airport it will take 25-30 minutes to get to Travestere station...warning, the station is not an eye pleaser...you will wonder what you've gotten yourself in to when you get off at the station but again, it's safe...just not easy on the eyes. The walk to the hotel is easy from the station but will take you 20 minutes...the good news is that you won't need the train station again until you leave...the bus and the hotel shuttle will provide ample transportation...again, the 170 bus will get you to the heart of Rome and you can go from there. As for local amenities...the side street to the hotel has a cute little shop with coffee and pastries which I used daily for breakfast...only a few Euros compared to the overpriced breakfast in the hotel...plus you experience the local life...and there were several pizzarias in the area for lunch/dinner. There is also a couple of small grocery stores for water, etc...(beware that they have fizzy and non fizzy water)...be careful to chose the correct one or you will be surpised when you take a big gulp. Finally, as you exit the hotel and walk to the end of Blaserna where you would normally take a right down to Marconi and the bus stops if you look to the left and across the street you will see a very unassuming building about 3-4 stories tall, with large metal pipes coming down the side (industrial looking)...well, there is a large supermarket in the basement and even a cinema in it...you would never know unless you go exploring like I did...it looked new to me so I hadn't heard about it before in any of the reviews...it's worth a few minutes to explore if for nothing else than the supermarket and snacks for the room. Overall, I would definitely stay here again...the locale gave you the Italian charm but the hotel was modern and comfortable...if you have any questions, don't hesitate to ask.", "Date": "October 18, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "WA", "Title": "\u201cWonderful - pleasantly surprised.

In fact the trains are all described with their stops in time order on posters in the station, so it is possible to find them, but after a sleepless night I gave up and took the Metro to Piramide armed with a detailed Michelin map. The walk was less than scenic, with a broken pavement, a metal industrial bridge to cross, graffiti everywhere, and a couple of scrapyards on the way down by the river. I have to admit, I'd wondered what I'd done in booking this hotel. My friend flew into Da Vinci airport from the US and had a totally different experience, easy train ride to Trastevere station, and followed the directions from an earlier review down a shopping street - coming from the other direction he wondered what I'd been talking about. Just saying, if you come in on the Metro, and take the shortest route, don't be put off by the surroundings, the hotel is in a reasonable residential neighbourhood, and we never felt threatened when walking back after dark. The hotel appears as a new building amongst a half built business park and highish apartment blocks, there is a church (with bells) and sports centre next door (with associated yelling and excitement), although there was no irritating noise and it was very quiet at night. Location is very good, it is far enough out of the city centre to be quiet, but it is easy to get to all the tourist spots. Trains and trams from Trastevere station, and the Metro from Piramide cover just about everything; if the worst happens (and we had a tram malfunction resulting in no trams one evening), it is walkable if you're reasonably fit. Figuring out the public transport can be a bit difficult because of the general lack of maps but http://www.atac.roma.it/ can be used to get a route from point a to point b. There is a very large supermarket at the top of the road, and a launderette next door (\u20ac4 for a wash, \u20ac4 for a dryer - which will need at least two cycles of 24 mins to dry things), there are many local restaurants. The room was spotlessly clean, large, the beds comfy, and the air conditioning worked very well throughout our stay. There is only BBC Worldwide (repeats articles constantly), and CNN English language channels on the tv (do they think we only watch news?), although watching English language films dubbed in Italian and German made for an interesting experience, as did the various sports channels. The curtains are of the blackout variety, so since the lights in the bathroom are very bright, not at all blocked by the glass door, and we didn't want total darkness, we ended up buying a night light to put into the bathroom socket; this gave us just enough illumination to not fall over furniture, and to use the bathroom if we had to get up during the night. The only quibble really with the room were privacy issues with the bathroom, as the door does not lock, is made of glass, and there is a 2cm gap all the way around it. We solved this by using the WCs on the ground floor if there was likely to be any anti-social results of a visit (how do I put that politely?) and by studiously looking the other way when the other person was in the shower if needing to leave the room. We never got up in time for breakfast, but ate two evening meals in the restaurant. These were rather disappointing as there is nothing whatever for vegetarians apart from one starter of pumpkin soup. This resulted in picking pieces of \"cattlefish\" out of a risotto for one meal, and worse, taking clams (still in their shells) out of a pasta dish in another, there was something crunchy in it (sand?) which was rather nasty and unfortunately it made me rather ill. My friend thought his meal was adequate (he is happy to eat shellfish). Luckily there are numerous restaurants serving extremely tasty and good value meals locally and all over the city, so the hotel restaurant can be reserved for emergency use only, if you don't want to go out again. Obviously I have no idea what the meat dishes were like, so I cannot say that it should be avoided, just don't plan on eating there if you are veggie. The best local restaurant we found, serving amazing wood oven pizzas was Retro, on the main road crossing the top of Pietro Blaserno, it had great service, and was very good value for money. The other gripe we had with the hotel was the lack of tea and coffee making facilities. Looking back we should have just bought a kettle and mugs locally when we found that there was nothing in the room, at the start of our two week stay. I made do with Cappuccinos from the hotel bar and what I could find during the day in Rome, my friend didn't get a cup of tea at all - especially as he brought herbal tea bags - because there was no hot water available anywhere. The staff all spoke excellent English, were unfailingly helpful and polite, and very friendly and welcoming. They even located and gave me access to the room early when I turned up in a bit of a state at 11am on the first day (see first paragraph), said that I could leave late (up to 1400) as my train didn't leave until 1840 on the last day and after that they'd allow me to leave my bags in their left luggage room, and directed me to the nearest pharmacy after I caught a cold in the second week. The chambermaids were very apologetic when they tried to clean the room mid-morning and before we located the door handle tag to let them know we didn't want to be disturbed. After we started using that, they never came to the room until it was removed. All the shampoo, soap and freebies in the bathroom were replenished daily, as were the towels. They were all stars.

From Da Vinci airport we took the train (NOT THE EXPRESS TO Termini!) to Trestevere. From there it was a 15 minute walk with our suitcase to the hotel. It's not a bad walk at all. I made the mistake of looking up directions on google maps, well google is wrong about which side of the train station you exit on. When walking to the hotel from Trestevere if you do not go under a bridge within 300 yards of the train station you are going in the wrong direction! Here are the super easy walking directions: 1) Exit Trestevere and go HARD right and follow the wall of the train station. That will lead you to a staircase. 2) Go down the staircase and turn right, this will take you under a bridge. 3) Continue on this road for a few blocks and take a left on Via Pietro Blasern 4) The hotel will be a couple blocks down on your left.

H10 boasts of modernity and a new Rome, and staying by the nice roof top swimming pool is almost surreal, since it displays the hotel's awkward location in a rather poor residential part of Rome. But H10 does not seem to be bothered by the surroundings. The H10 team seems determined to make an impression, and so they do. Fairly many Spanish tourists (is H10 a Spanish chain?) and the atmosphere is warm yet professional. Indeed a very very good deal in Rome right now and a welcome competition to typical Roman hotels.

It is a lovely, modern hotel, excellent rooms and the beds are lovely and huge. The pool on the roof top whilst small, is lovely after you have been sight seeing all day, you pay a deposit of 15 euros each for a towel which is returned to you as you leave and return the towel. Shame there is not a bar up there though! and there are no umbrellas. There is only 1 English channel on the tele, not that you will be in your room much i expect, but just letting you know. The breakfast is expensive as the last person stated 17 euros! but there is a bakery up the road and a Spar supermarket to get food if you want. The view around the hotel is not the best as there is some building work currently going on opposite the hotel, but it is not too bad at all in terms of noise. In fact the hotel is pretty peaceful. The bar shuts at 10pm which was a shame and was a suprise. They have a shuttle bus 4 times day but please note the last one back is at 5pm from the Centre. The 170 bus goes to and from near the hotel into the centre and does not cost much. A taxi into the centre costs around 10 euros plus, depending which part of rome you want to go to, generally 10 euros to the Coluseum. The hotel is very good value, just be prepared to use the buses etc into town. The only thing i would say is that as the hotel is pretty new, the ambience is yet to develop if that makes sense? if you get a taxi, make sure you have change as one of the drivers pretended he had none, so this forced us having to give him a fare sized tip! i would recommend this hotel for the price you pay. It cost 45 euros to Ciampino airport in a private taxi and is about half an hour away. Oh and try the Argentinian restaurant Bavira (i think) there are 2 of them one near Piazza Nirvona and the other near the Coluseum, great steaks! half a caraf of wine is only 3 euros! simple food though. but tasty and the restaurant facing the Pantheon has lovely staff and an amazing location at night.", "Date": "June 13, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Toronto, Canada", "Title": "\u201cCLEAN, MODERN, LARGE ROOMS, EXCELLENT LOCATION\u201d", "Author": "TERESAMARIA", "ReviewID": "UR31970547", "Content": "Hello fellow travellers I stayed at H10 Roma Citta for 10 days as a solo traveller in a double room.

The bus to take you into Rome is bus #170 or you can choose the shuttle @ the hotel which leaves at two different times in the morning and returns @ two different times in the evening. So, my suggestion, take the shuttle into town, and take the bus to return to hotel, if you are unsure how long you will stay in the city. Also, there are bank machines, pharmacy, banks, cafe & bakery shops, shopping stores(clothes/shoes), supermarkets, esthetics to get your hair and nails done all within walking distance and 5 mintues from the hotel.

A lovely pool and jacuzzi opened the Saturday we were there, on the fifth floor roof, and it was terrific to wallow an hour up there after a day of traipsing through the Vatican. We did not get the breakfast included, as there are several pastry shops up the street. It looks like two hotels are going up across the street so perhaps this area will one day be \"up and coming\". There is a hotel shuttle that goes to Rome center city four times a day, two in the morning, two in the afternoon, but the times did not work for us. We got a great tip from a front desk clerk -- walk (or take the 170 or 781 bus) to Trestavere Station, cross the street and catch the #8 tram that takes you to Trestavere itself (the last stop before crossing the river). You can also take it to the end and it will drop you off in city center Rome, within walking distance of all the tourist attractions. What no one told us was that ABSOLUTELY NO ONE PAYS TO RIDE THE TRAINS, BUSES OR TRAMS. We had a Roma Pass and when we used it the first time people looked at us like we were nuts. Consequently, we did not pay the 5.5 Euros when we returned to the airport; no one checks tickets. We walked from the train station late at night and never felt uneasy, but you are a good 20 minutes from the action in Trestavere and about 1/2 hour from Rome city center. The hotel itself is very Italian modern, with large rooms, a very large bathroom with excellent shower heads, a bidet, and lots of extras such as toothbrushes, combs, shampoo, lotion, shower gel, and sewing kits provided, along with soap. Nice think towels, but no washcloths, but two different hand towel sizes. The TV is a flat screen, with CNN, BBC and stations in french, spanish, italian and other languages. There is a small bar and the bartender (I think he was named Mauro) made the best Rossine (champagne and rasberries?) we had. the problem is there seemed to be only one bartender to make the drinks and to wait on people sitting in the lounge, as well as provide drinks and coffee for meeting areas and room service.

(Remember to validate the train ticket 5.50 Euros before getting on the train) But once there it was a comfortable and luxurious experience for the price. The 170 bus took about 20 minutes and the hotel lays on a free shuttle to the centre at 930, 11am and then twice in the afternoon, so all in all very easy to get around. The area the hotel is in is not that pretty, but then the cost and quality of the hotel make up for this as does the consistently helpful and friendly attitude of the staff. When we arrived the TV wasn't working, the safe would not lock and my adapter didnt fit!!! Each time I asked for help the 'technician' was sent and fixed things within 10 minutes. You cant get better. The bed was a 7ft by 7 ft 'king' size, the likes of which I have never seen before!!! Wonderful. The bathroom had a huge bath and a wonderful shower and bidet. Rome itself is beautiful and takes your breath away. It gets very hot and I wouldn't recommend the open top bus tours at all, they cover the same route that we walked. Once you get bearings, you can walk to the Vatican from the city centre (Piazza de Venizia/Via del Corso) within about 30 minutes, or the Coloseum in about 10 minutes. You can get a ticket for a few days or a week that covers the buses, trams and local trains (a week was 16 Euros). If you take a taxi it costs about 12 Euros to the hotel (once the find where it is as it was only built in December 2008). Wonderful, if you don't mind a little adventure getting there and a short trip on a sometimes crowded bus post-adventure!!!!!

It's 700 meters, which is the equivalent of a little over 6 football fields. When you walk out of the train station, you need to get your bearings. Make a right turn out of the entrance and go along the side of the building. At the end of the sidewalk in front of the building, about 10 yards away, there is a staircase that takes you down to the street level. Go down the stairs. Make another right turn, and go underneath a scary overpass (complete with various persons in a homeless state). Then you keep going for about 1/2 mile. You will pass a street called Via Albert Einstein. A few blocks up is the Via Pietro Blaserna, make a left. It doesn't look like there is a hotel anywhere around. You have to keep going about 3 blocks down, then make a left turn, and go down about another block to the actual hotel itself. After a long day of sightseeing, we took the #170 bus back, the stop is on the main street, few blocks from the hotel. It's the 12th stop but since the buses don't make every stop, ask the driver which one you want to get off at and the driver will let you know. Took about 20 minutes without traffic. Was nice to go back to a clean and comfortable room and take a hot shower with good water pressure. And the hotel has free wifi and 4 computers you can use, which is nice. Since we were staying there one night to catch an early morning flight home, we didn't mind it too much but it was an adventure getting there.

It was really hard to find anything, and even the expensive hotels had rather poor reviews. Finally I bumped into the H10. The hotel pictures, reviews, and modest prices stood out above everything else, so I decided to give it a try. It was a good choice. As other reviewers have remarked, the hotel is brand new and stylishly decorated: everything works and is clean and in good shape. The beds are very comfortable both for sitting and sleeping, with my only complaint that I found the duvet a bit too hot (but as there is no noise on the street you can leave the window open, or alternatively turn on the aircon or take off the duvet and use just the blanket). Bath and shower are modern and in good shape like the rest of the hotel, with good water pressure and temperature. Other pros of this hotel are the free wifi service throughout the building, 5 free computers in the lobby (alas no printers), and the cooked-to-order eggs and bacon for breakfast. The bar also looked stylish and cosy, but seems to close rather early at night. The only issue about this hotel is its location: it's in a residential area, about 4 km South of the city centre or 2 km South of the Trastevere area, which is popular for its bars and restaurants. It's too far to walk. There is a bus stop at 5 minutes walk from the hotel (bus 170), and it takes 15-20 minutes to reach the terminus at Piazza Venezia. A taxi costs around 15 euros. The hotel offers a complimentary shuttle to the city centre, but it only leaves 5 times per day at fixed hours so it's not very useful. I have to add that personally I found the travel no problem at all, and I even enjoyed seeing a non-touristy part of Rome. But it does make it less convenient to quickly pop by your hotel if you should forget something or want to take a short rest. If you're travelling to the hotel from Rome's main Airport (Fiumicino) then DO NOT take the Leonardo da Vinci Express to Roma Termini, but rather take the normal train to Roma Trastevere station. From there it's a 10-15 minute walk or a short bus/taxi ride to the hotel.

Very close is a shopping area with good prices at everything !
