The lady who I assume is the manager, Alexandra, was there to meet us when we arrived, and allocated us to our room-'Berlin'. The room was pleasant, clean , had two very comfortable beds. flat scren TV and shower room. It didn't have any wardrobes-which was a slight problem-however there are plenty of hooks to hang clothes on and the two of us managed fine for our four day stay, The following morning breakfast was waiting for us at 9 (we had been asked what time we would like to eat)-all freshly prepared. There was cereal, a fresh bread roll with ham, chees and salad, croissants with jam and fruit yogurt! After this we didn't need to eat until evening! The hotel is about 25 minutes walk from the memorial Chrch adn KaDeWe, and ten minutes from Charlottenburg S-Bahn station (3 euro fare from Schoenefeld!) I would definitely recommend this hotel-and Berlin was fab!", "Date": "December 1, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Sleep Quality": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Wiesbaden", "Title": "\u201cLocation nice, the \"hotel\" a shame\u201d", "Author": "Joey034", "ReviewID": "UR63449029", "Content": "This is not a hotel, but a collection of 4 or 5 tiny converted rooms on one ground floor within an apartment house, with a business model probably of just making a quick buck out of the booming Berlin tourist traffic. Rooms are quite new and clean, location fine (Charlottenburg, West Berlin city centre) with shopping, transport, bars and restaurants nearby, so much for the positives. And oh well, it is cheap yes - but as always: you get what you pay for. Add a few more euros and stay in a decent place! Rooms are minuscule and have a prison cell feel. TV and hairdryer are there, but no table, wardrobe, desktop or any other convenience items. They don't have room numbers, but room names (Rome, Paris etc.) which according to their website are \"directly related to the room's individual character\". If so, poor Rome and Paris - cities I would never-ever want to visit if these rooms were supposed to be the cities' ambassadors! You can hear every single sound from the adjacent rooms and bathrooms. Door banging, phone calls, conversations... all those things you ALWAYS HATED when staying in hotels. Service is non-existent, towels not changed, reception only sporadically staffed, and if staffed the receptionist keeps talking into his mobile phone glued to his ear while you try asking him for something. If you arrive late for checkin, you have to call and wait for someone to get you in and you will not be treated as a guest, but as a nuisance. Breakfast is ok - if it is served, that is - if it is not served although you paid extra for it, don't expect any apologies or even a refund. Statements on their website are ridiculous: \"Unser kundenorientierter Service erf\u00fcllt Ihnen jedweden m\u00f6glichen Wunsch rasch, kompetent und freundlich. - Our customer-oriented service will fulfil every imaginable wish of yours in a quick, competent and friendly manner.\" Psychiatrists call this state of mind a \"delusion\", it seems to occur quite frequently in the \"service\" industry. Some may argue \"it's ok if you just need a cheap place to sleep\". No it's not. Life is too short to waste your time in places like these.", "Date": "May 6, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Location": "1", "Rooms": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "london", "Title": "\u201cScummers, do not stay here\u201d", "Author": "graoutso", "ReviewID": "UR49623264", "Content": "Do not stay at this hotel. Its is not even a proper hotel. There is no one there even to pick up the phones which means that when you arive you have to call a number for someone to come and let you in. I had prepaid for this hotel arrived there at 10 o clock at night and could not get in. Called the number that they had outside and after 15 minutes a very dodgy guy came to take me in different hotel as this one was full. In the other hotel which was very old and terrible they were trying to make me pay more and would not stop until i threatened to call the police.
