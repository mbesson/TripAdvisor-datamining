{"Reviews": [{"Content": "bad first impression but give it a try Just returned from trip to Italy , Milan, Florence and Venice. Stayed at the Beatrice for two nights. Extremely close to train and bus station so very easy to find. When arriving at hotel the actual hotel is on the third floor of a building on a narrow street. It looks quite intimidating when you enter the lobby. The hotel it self is clean and efficient for a short stay. The desk staff a middle aged man was very helpful and friendly, spoke perfect english and made the stay very enjoyable. It is close to the open market which has great deals on leather and other items. Would return to Florence !", "Date": "Oct 25, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR258906226", "Ratings": {"Service": "-1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "-1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "2", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "-1", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "NewYorkStar18"}, {"Content": "Loved Hotel Beatrice  We have stayed in this delightful family run hotel three times  have always been treated warmly by everyone!! A wonderful experience for a simple and nice 3 star hotel ~ better than some more upscale 3 star hotels we have stayed in anywhere in Europe. Costantino, is a gem and has great command of English. Along with the way we have been treated, I heard him speaking with other guests ~ he and his wife are always kind and professional. I asked for restaurant ideas ~ Costantino is ripe with great suggestions, each of which we enjoyed very much. We've stayed in three different delightful rooms, some are bigger and some a bit smaller than others but all with very comfortable beds fitted with the softest linens, pleasant floral wallpaper, nice furniture, tile floors as we have had in many European hotels, and updated decent size bathrooms. The hotel is not on the ground floor therefore steps or the lift are necessary. The breakfast includes fresh made coffee, cappuccino, hot cocoa, juice, croissants, rolls, nutella, meats, yoghurt, cheese and plenty of fresh fruit of the season. Location is very convenient to the Duomo, San Lorenzo Market, Mercato Centrale, Medici Chapel, Church of Santa Maria Novella, San Lorenzo, plenty of great restaurants and the train station. We already plan to return as do friends who have stayed at Beatrice. You can be comfortable and well taken care of at Hotel Beatrice!!", "Date": "Apr 9, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR474743021", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "3", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "FloridaGinger"}, {"Content": "loved it!!!! We traveled througout Italy and this was our favorite hotel! the staff is really helpful and the rooms were simple but cute.

I called them to book the room in order to ensure that there was a 24 hour reception. The owner's wife, who seemed to be lovely on the phone, ensured me that there was. On arrival, I was told that the hotel closes at 10pm and if I wanted to stay out until 1130pm I would have to pay 30 euro extra. Given that I was going out for the evening and didn't want to adhere to a time limit, I told her that it didn't suit me. She screamed at me, threw my passport at me and walked away from the reception! I left and went to the nearby Hotel Baglioni where the staff were lovely. The situation of Hotel Beatrice is not ideal- down a dirty street where a lot of young guys were hanging out. I felt a bit threatened walking to the hotel from the station as I was on my own (a young woman)and the lady who works on reception is the rudest person that I have ever met. I never got as far as to see the rooms but I wouldn't recommend this hotel! There are many others in Florence that are really lovely-Hotel Baglioni is one of them. It is worth paying an extra few euro to stay in another hotel in my opinion.", "Date": "May 9, 2006", "ReviewID": "UR901906412", "Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "-1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "1", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "-1", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member"}, {"Content": "A Great Find This hotel was a great find after arriving in the evening and having no luck finding a room after trying about 6 hotels.

Requested a quiet room. The room was clean, the staff was accomodating, but the walls were paper thin. We expected the occasional vespa noise, but we did not expect all the noise from inside the hotel- including our neighbors walking, talking, showering and a baby crying. When we complained about the noise, the hotel staff stated that the room was quiet and if we wanted more quiet then we would need to stay in the country.

The best thing about this modest hotel is the wonderful staff. Constantino, the owner, went out of his way to provide good service. My husband and I stayed there in Sept 04 with another couple. Both rooms were good size and very comfortable.Not only did they give us great advice for local restaurants, but got us tickets for the sites, and booked a tour to Sienna for us.I was worried that close to the train station might be not be desirable but the convenience was worth it. You are also a block and a half from the market which was fun to shop in on your way to the museums. I would highly recommend this hotel.", "Date": "Oct 17, 2004", "ReviewID": "UR107686169", "Ratings": {"Service": "-1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "-1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "4", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "-1", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "sisflynn"}, {"Content": "Covenient location, decent rooms, friendly staff. My wife and I stayed at this hotel for 2 nights in September. We found the accomodations to be average for a European hotel. The immediate neighborhood that the hotel is in, a block from the train station, is very dirty and leaves a lot to be desired. The hotel itself, which is on the second floor of a 7 story building, is fine. The staff was very warm and helpful, offering information, maps, directions,etc.. Hotel Beatrice only has their lobby open from 7am to around 1am, so plan your time accordingly.

The 3 minute walk is doable even at the end of your trip :-)We had a bit of trouble with the staff/manager. When we informed her, a day in advance, that we would not take breakfast on the day of our departure, since we needed to leave at 6:15 am, we were told that breakfast could not be removed from our bill (which we know not to be true). When we pointed to our Rick Steve's guide we were told breakfast could have been removed if we had told them when we made our reservations.You are also literally locked in at night -- which is a bit scary from a fire saftey perspective -- and means that you have to make special arrangements if you want to leave early or come in late.Breakfasts were pretty good - we got fresh fruit in addition to the usuals (rolls, jam, yogurt, corn flakes). The capuccini were pretty aweful though -- go down the block for better coffee drinks.Rooms vary in quality quite a bit -- my husband and I were there for our anniversary and put into twin beds at opposite ends of a long, narrow, dark room (despite our reservation for a matrimonial bed). Our reservation was messed up and we were put in a triple with my mother-in-law the last day as the hotel was full.", "Date": "Jun 23, 2004", "ReviewID": "UR997205723", "Ratings": {"Service": "-1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "-1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "2", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "-1", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member"}, {"Content": "Bellissimo e comodissimo   showReview(19534380, 'full');", "Date": "Aug 30, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR266920906", "Ratings": {"Service": "-1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "cla83"}, {"Content": "L'albergo \u732b ben...   showReview(11408882, 'full');", "Date": "Jun 11, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR833040045", "Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "3", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "lass="}, {"Content": "Posizione strategica...   showReview(11408883, 'full');", "Date": "Oct 7, 2006", "ReviewID": "UR714396715", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "4", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "lass="}, {"Content": "Sarebbe molto meglio se la...   showReview(12649793, 'full');", "Date": "Nov 7, 2002", "ReviewID": "UR881877681", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "4", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "lass="}], "HotelInfo": {"HotelURL": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g187895-d258611-r21191336-Hotel_Beatrice-Florence_Tuscany.html", "HotelID": "258611", "Price": "$138"}}
