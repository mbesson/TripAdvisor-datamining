Not to far to walk to underground lines, and taxi from Toyko station is cheap and only a few minutes ride away. The rooms are small but very nice and stylish. Our bathroom had a window that looked into the bedroom which could be closed for privacy but was kinda quirky. The hotel has a nice bar with big cushy chairs where we relaxed after returning to our hotel after dinner. Its a close walk to the Shiodome - try the restaurants at the top of the Caretta building, as long as you don't mind heights take the glass elevators which go up the side of the building to the 45th floor restaurants.", "Date": "Dec 14, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR369377460", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "Jo_Wicky"}, {"Content": "Great Value for their lower cost rooms My first time to stay at the Mitsui Ginza, and I have to say that I am impressed. I took a room on the low end (under Y20000) and was very happy about the ammenities and the bathroom. The Mitsui is around Y5000 more than my usual stay in the area, the Villa Fontaine, but the extra cost is worth the bathroom alone for me. The shower and bath are seperate and large, and very comfortable. The room is small, even slightly smaller than the usual standard of Japanese rooms. This results in there being less storage than usual. The closet is very narrow, no wardrobe, and no wall hooks upon which to put a coat. You luggage is liable to fill up any of the existing floorspace, and you clothes piled on the coffee table and chair. My only other complaint was that the toilet smelled, the washlet spout needed a proper disinfecting, and was mildewed - sloppy cleaning staff. For a room at the hight end of cost +Y25000, I may choose to go back to my old favorite, The Park Hotel Shiodome, which is truly a class act, but for a room on the lower end I heartily recommend a stay here, and will be back for another go soon.", "Date": "Dec 5, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR511457643", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "4", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "4", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "3"}, "Author": "SfumatoPants"}, {"Content": "Small Rooms but good location and views Looking at the other reviews I guess people like these artsy types of hotels though I prefer getting more value for money and less of the artsy touches that this place had. We booked a double room with breakfast for 1 night and paid 29,400 yen or about \u62e2196 at the current exchange rates. This place was not worth more than a \u62e2100 in my opinion. The room was interesting with a nice view over downtown Tokyo and had various quirky things but again just give me a nice comfortable, decent size room at a good price and I'm happy. The breakfast buffet was rather sparse and included more lunch-type items like beef/pork mini hamburgers then traditional western or japanese foods. I would not go back to this place unless they drop the price. Location is very good though for Ginza and other areas.", "Date": "Nov 13, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR668895172", "Ratings": {"Service": "-1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "-1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "3", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "-1", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "LondonTravellertoo"}, {"Content": "A stylish gem in the heart of Ginza       Bed", "Date": "Sep 21, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR821056995", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "5", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "Liz8212"}, {"Content": "good location I selected this hotel for two reasons. Firstly, convenience, it is on the route of the airport limousine bus from Narita airport, in fact the bus stops immediatley outside the hotel. Secondly, the hotels location, a short walk into the heart of Ginza, a five minute walk to the fish markets and ease of access to other areas. The reception and staff were very helpful and friendly, all staff spoke English fluently. The hotels rooms were surpisingly spacious, extremely well equipped and immaculate. The bathrooms were also very well equipped and the room had good views from all windows. I stayed here for four nights in August and I used the hotel resteraunt for breakfast on most morinings, the quality of food was good, although there was not a wide international selection and therefore, unfortunately did not represent good value for money. Overall this hotel represents good value and is set in a good and convienent location.", "Date": "Sep 13, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR143635617", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "sandinmyshoe"}, {"Content": "Great Hotel in Ginza       View from the hall", "Date": "Aug 20, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR852305360", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "florindaReunion"}, {"Content": "\u6e1a\u57ae\u57c4\u9287\ue042\u5139\u9288\u4fbf\u5157\u9288\u67ab\u5133\u9289\u70bd\u20ac\u4f75\u4eb0\u9287\u693c\u5011\u9288\u5c7b\u4efe\u9350\u5470\ue5ca   showReview(23404531, 'full');", "Date": "Jan 9, 2009", "ReviewID": "UR738183872", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "PIYOSAMA"}, {"Content": "Bel hotel sur Ginza   showReview(23308402, 'full');", "Date": "Jan 6, 2009", "ReviewID": "UR761472175", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "Gracus"}, {"Content": "Good\u9286\u20acLocation   showReview(20819450, 'full');", "Date": "Oct 12, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR641300050", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "mujita"}], "HotelInfo": {"HotelURL": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1066444-d1082914-r22786579-Mitsui_Garden_Hotel_Ginza_Premier-Chuo_Tokyo_Tokyo_Prefecture_Kanto.html", "HotelID": "1082914", "Price": "$264"}}
