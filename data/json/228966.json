Staff was very friendly and helpful. The room was so nice and cleaned every day. The price was same like in the cheapest hostels (own double-bed room), but the service was on higher level! The breakfasts were absolutely great - original italiano espresso or cappuccino (or tea), delicious fresh croissants and other Italian sweets as many you can eat, butter, jam, orange juice and also packed hotel crispy toasts. Location is also good - not noisy, very close to Termini station - c. 300 meters to underground and also close to Colosseum (c. 15 minutes of walking). In spite of that in Rome was only about 4\u00b0C and our last day of stay was snowing (second time per last 26 years!) in the room was warm temperature enought - there is heating (what is not so usual in the Rome) and also air condition which can heat until 30\u00b0C.

It was extremely close to the Roma Termini (5 minute walk). The bathroom was clean and the sheets looked sanitary as well. The front desk was helpful, they gave us a map, restaurant advice, and free luggage storage after we had checked out. Breakfast was a nice thing to have as well, typical European breakfast consisting of croissants, rolls, jams, butter, and coffee to order. Nothing special, but a time saver in the morning. They also had wifi, but only in the lobby. The only thing i would warn people about is the fact that the hotel lobby is on one floor above the ground floor, so you have to ring the buzzer to be let in.

The Hotel itself was very handy for us, being only a two minute walk away from the train station. We were warmly welcolmed and showed where our room was. The room we had was very dated and dingy. Dark green, and only one tiny window that was in the side of the wall so hardly any light came in at all. In the early morning you could hear the bins being collected, but this wasn't a big negative for us, just one of those things. Overall, the room suited what we needed...a place to sleep at night! We really weren't using it for much more than that, and from the hotel we walked to every place we wanted to see, except the Vatican city were we got the train too. Breakfast is included in the price which is good, but when we were there it looked like either a large family group, or a small school group, were staying at the same time, and really the breakfast area was not big enough to accomodate everyone, so we only ate in the area once during our stay. Was alright, bread, pastries, tea coffee etc. However, out of everything, the service was great, with the owners doing all they can to accomodate you, even phoning us a taxi to take us to the airport.

Talk with Tony at the front desk who is there the major portion of the day. He'll treat you like family. Need a question answered, ask Tony. The hotel is very cozy and very close to the Bus Terminus. It includes a morning breakfast and great service. Book now and enjoy a super exciting trip in Rome. At least I did : ) OH tips in ROME: If you like walking and you'll be there at least 3 days, then don't buy the bus tour, just walk. Get the map from Tony and literally walk from the hotel to close to the Vatican in 30 min. We bought the bus tour then the next day we gave it up and walked. If you get tired just catch the city bus for 1e. Just see a popular site you want to go to and ask at the bus termini for the # bus that goes there. To get back to the hotel just ask what bus goes to the termini, then walk from the termini to the hotel (2min) OH, as for resto's ck trip advisor. Your'll see great recommendation, just choose Italian food, Dinning, $70 and under and you'll have excellent resto's at 14e a person. OH. To and from the hotel from airport is 4 euros each way eachperson. Take bus company called .... hmm i don't have the name with me, but the bus stops on the opposite side of the termini from Aquarium's side's hotel. I told Tony about it, just ask him. The info inside the termini don't even know about it or won't tell you cause they want you to use their train at 15 e each.

There are a few things that made our stay unpleasant: the neighbourhood feels a little dodgy, there is no soundproofing so expect to be awake at least half the night, the bathroom was tiny and not that clean (bins not emptied for 3 days) despite the very strong chemical smell, the shower was so small you can hardly move and it did not drain properly, so you end up standing in a few inches of water and after maybe about 2 minutes you actually have to turn the shower off to let it drain otherwise it would flood, then you can resume your shower for another few minutes....and repeat the process....

The decor of the room was nasty and migraine inducing (clearly not been re-decorated since the 1970s), the fabric wallcovering was filthy and smelt. The room only had a small window and was so dark it resembled a prison cell. The aircon did not cool the room, however made enough noise to rival a jumbo jet - if that's what you're after than great if you wish to sleep not so great. The bathroom was tiny and looked like it could fall apart any second, and hot water elusive. (when I told the oger at reception about this, I was barked at and told to go back to my room and wait- naturally as a guest I shouldn't expect hot water- I'm clearly far too demanding) The staff were unhelpful, did not attempt to communicate with the guests, they just grunted or alternatively barked. The towels and sheets looked like they had been through the war, actually the towel was more fray than towel. The bed was like concrete and the pillows flat as pancakes, but i presume they are very concerned about their guests backs. To top off the wonderful night I spent there, the tv in the hotel lounge was on until 2am and the receptionist on night duty was clearly hard of hearing, sadly I'm not. Oh and then there were the bins outside our windows which stank (a pretty amazing achievement to smell bins 2 floors up) and were emptied by a big loud truck at 4am, really gets you into the local atmosphere.

The staff were very friendly and helpful quite happy to give directions, advice and recommmendations for local restaurants etc. While on the subject of local restaurants turn right out of the hotel, proceed down the street a few hundred metres and on the opposite side is a restaurant (trattatoria Giovanni's) that serves the best homemade Italian food in the area at a excellent price that must be tried on your holiday in Rome!!! Tip: Save your money for the food dont feel obliged to buy roses or give money to every street musician that comes along during your meal, pay them once per group per meal and only buy a rose if you want to.
