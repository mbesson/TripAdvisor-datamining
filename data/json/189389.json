We booked the Junior Suite, but i am sure that we were upgraded to an apartment, with Butler service. The room was huge and was amazing. Loving the My Bed. Best nights sleep in a long time!! We chose this hotel for a special birthday celebration and we were treated wonderfully. It was quite overwhelming. To begin with we checked in early and shown to our room by our lovely butler, who was fantastic, so helpful. The hotel then sent up a birthday cake, which they organised. A total surprise. We asked our butler which Indonesian restaurant he could recommend, and he actually booked us one we had seen on the web prior to us coming to Amsterdam. But thought it was too late to book as booking is done well in advance, but he managed to get us a table, which was fantastic. It was called Tempo Doeloe, highly recommend it (thats another review). The breakfast, with complementary champagne was great and the staff new it was my husbands birthday, and brought him in a Dutch apple cake with candle (more like a flare) and the waitress, who was so lovely sang to him, amazing voice. We felt so spoilt. During our stay there were so many other things that the hotel did for us that made our stay spectacular. On our last day the hotel let us have a later check out time as they new we were getting a later flight and arranged a transfer to the airport. Overall, all the staff at the hotel made our stay so much more than what we were expecting, it was quite sad to leave. Since we have been back, we have recommended the hotel to all our friends and family. Thank you all so much.

The Sofitel is very comfortable, and although a larger luxury hotel it retains it dutch feeling. The area is lovely and central to everything. I was on my own a good deal as my husband was attending a conference and at no time did I worry about walking on my own or around the area of this hotel. The concierge has sent us to wonderful restaurants (not touristy ones - more where the dutch would eat). the staff are very friendly and always remember our names.

We've stayed at five and six star hotels, and this is, at best, a 3-4 star hotel. At a true five star, one would expect most things to be seamless and offer excellent service with a great attention to detail. Nothing was seamless except for when it was time to pay on checking out. Let's start with the reservation process which was a bit of a headache. I emailed with them back and forth and inquired about the Stay 4, Pay 3 nights. One person confirmed the promotion, and another person quoted me the full price. I don't think it's too much to ask for people to read the chain of prior emails. I also asked for a room with one bed (it was our 1 year wedding anniversary celebration, and we wanted to be in the same bed - go figure). We had inquired about early check in, and upon arrival, we were delighted to hear our room was ready. When we walked in, there were two double beds. Not awesome. So we asked for another room, presuming it'd be comparable. Nope, the second room we got was most likely their emergency back up room because it was probably the worst room in the entire hotel (room 360, by the way). There's a large pole in the middle of the room, and it's directly above the entrance so you get to hear people's conversations. The butler who walked us to our new room was a bit pretentious and lacked all sense of warmth. He asked why we chose Amsterdam when there are many other cities like Paris and Rome. Odd question, I thought. I told him that we've been to all of the other cities he named, which quieted him. It certainly felt like he was making a presumption that all tourists were there to smoke pot, watch sex shows, and trash the city. Thanks for the implication. One thing people should be aware of - there is NO WATER PRESSURE in the shower head. Not a wonderful job with renovations if you can't offer water pressure. The cleaning service was not of even a four star caliber hotel. For one thing, they are extremely FRUGAL with their little bottles of Hermes product. It'd be empty or near empty and they still would not replace it. DonI'm amazed that people rated this hotel so well. If you have the fortunate opportunity to compare, go stay at a hotel equivalent to the Raffles or any five or six star hotel in Asia and you'll see a remarkable difference.'t pretend to offer luxury by offering Hermes when you don't replenish it. And if you're lucky, you might get one bottle of water at turn down service. You might get two if you're really, really lucky. Sometimes, we got no bottles of water. We dined at Bridges, which was a nice restaurant and did provide good service. It wasn't impeccable like La Rive, however. I'm surprised about all of the rave reviews on here.

When I arrived I understood they choose one the best hotels in Amsterdam. The hotel is old dutch building,rooms with hign ceilings, but the best part it was all very modern, high tech and quiet. The bathrooms were amazing (because uncertain events I had to check out and re check in so I stayed in two different rooms.) the bed was all comfy I mean all was looking very new especially \u00c4\u00b1f you know the hotels in Amsterdam.

The building is the prinsenhof, which has longstanding roots with the house of Orange (Dutch Royal family). The current Queen of Holland actually got married in this building - Rooms look beautiful with walk in showers and closets, art deco interior, very comfortable beds and a free nespresso coffee machine, free newspaper in the morning) - staff is well trained and ver attentative (only mishap on my visit is that my complementary newspaper wasn't there in the morning) - food at the hotel is solid, but nothing extremely special (but if you are in the centre of Amsterdam, there's plenty of good restaurants close by) In general it's a great hotel to stay.

I did not like the low pressure shower head and the price ( circa EUR 30-35) of the breakfast. The restaurant is not well lighted and the food is ok but not worth EUR30. I liked the location and the pool.

So I thought I'd give this one a go. Overall, we liked it a lot. It's in a large, historic, very interesting building -- they have a guided tour that unfortunately we didn't have time to do. Our luxury room wasn't overly spacious but not oppressively small either. The bathroom, with tub and separate rainshower, was modern and sleek and looked like it had been recently renovated. We requested a canal-side room and that's what we got. Dinner at Bridges restaurant, which specializes in seafood, was outstanding (but I would have liked more vegetables please!) I wavered between giving this a 4 and a 5 for a number of (probably overly picky) reasons. But here goes. Breakfast was included in our rate. It's served buffet style, and there are also some cooked items that you can order separately. I've rarely found a hotel that does this well. Because guests serve themselves, and the staff are constantly having to clear tables, take orders, and replenish the buffet items, the result is chaos. I had to keep dodging staff who were walking briskly, loaded down with dishes. If you want to order something from the a la carte menu, you have to flag down one of the waiting staff, and this can be hard when the restaurant is busy. One morning, the main restaurant was full, so we were directed to the overflow room on the other side of the hotel. It was a nice room and actually quieter. But they ran out of some items that took a while to replenish. The hotel has a swimming pool as well as sauna and steam room, which is all very nice. But there's nowhere to lounge around the pool. So apparently the idea is that you swim, maybe go into the sauna or steam room, then leave. Which is not as relaxing as it could be. The hotel is on the border of the red light district, which is seedy in a safe sort of way. If you turn right when leaving the hotel, you're in the Amsterdam of a thousand bachelor parties; turn left and there isn't a single brothel in sight. I think this was okay for one night, but three nights of it was a bit much for me. The fact that you enter the hotel through a courtyard gives you the sense that you've left that all behind.

Rooms were normal size for European standards, with a nice bathroom and good range of Hermes ammenities (though for me, they felt more a scent men would prefer than women). Bed was softer than I am normally use to, but comfortable none the less. Use the free \"low speed\" internet in my room, which met all my needs e.g. could still do skype video chats etc. My room faced the inner courtyard, so was very quiet. Breakfast is very good, but you have to order hot food (so if you are in a rush, order it as soon as you step inside). Hotel is about a 10 minute walk from the main train station, and just on the edge of the red light district and shoppin area. So you are not in the middle of any, but only a stones throw away, which made the hotel very suitabel for me (ie all the convenience without the noise, but again I had a inner courtyard viewing room). lastly, there is a gym, but it is very small with just a few cardio machines and some weights and one other machine. Only 2 small negatives were , the room rate is not cheap for those on a budget, and the lift if you need it is al little slow.

When we first arrived it was all good and we were greeted by a very helpful guest relations manager and shown to our room. The experience turned for the worst the night morning when we went for breakfast the next morning. Understandably it was a Sunday morning at 9.30am so it was packed full. The restaurant is composed of mainly a few large square tables of 8 which means you have to share your breakfast table with 2-3 other groups of guests if the restaurant is full. Otherwise you wait until a table is free - could have been at least half hour. Not a very nice \"first thing in the morning experience\" to share a table with strangers, especially when breakfast costs \u00e2\u201a\u00ac33 per person. Service was slow at breakfast and we were not even served our coffees until we had almost finished breakfast. We also had to flag down staff to order our coffees and hot food. Again for \u00e2\u201a\u00ac66 this has to be the worst and most expensive breakfast ever. We were in our room getting ready to check out before 12pm and we had 2 staff ring our bell wanting to get in the room. It was really disruptive as we obviously had not checked out so room could not be cleaned yet. Not sure if this is their way of scooting guests out of the hotel. When we went down to the lobby to check out, there was one long queue of about 5 groups of people waiting to be served by 2 staff. I got in line but when I got to the front of the queue another line had formed behind the desk of the second staff - effectively pushing in. The staff paid no attention and just served whoever was in front of her desk. This has got to be the worst service on check-out I've ever had. I must have waited for 15 minutes but people who pushed in did not even had to wait 2 minutes. The arrangement at reception should be made more clear to avoid misunderstandings. Even though the hotel bill had a \u00e2\u201a\u00ac50 charge for overnight parking the front desk staff asked if I needed transport. Mmmm... There were some exceptional staff at this hotel but it's typical Sofitel which I have found really is a Novotel that is better designed and decorated with designer toiletries, better bedding and a fancy restaurant and bar. Attitude is the same as any other mass market hotel chain mentality. As we were dragging our bags out to the car, the front door staff just watched us and only offered to help when we were moving our last one, which was really funny. There is no bath in the superior rooms but shower only. The shower head had very poor low pressure even though it was about 20cm wide. The rooms facing the front can be noisy as well. Overall it's a nice hotel on the outside but they need to improve on the \"software\". They also opened a spa and swimming pool on the 1st floor since the first time we were there.", "Date": "July 28, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "London, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cWhat an amzing hotel\u201d", "Author": "londonha8", "ReviewID": "UR115819387", "Content": "We had the most amazing time in Amsterdam and the hotel was the best we have stayed in, everyone was so helpful with such comfortable room & beds, my wife loved the way when we came back from our evening out to find our curtains had been closed :-) . we would deffinatly stay again.

Everything is done to ensure that their guests feel comfortable. Breakfast is a sumptuous affair - probably one of the best I have had anywhere. So good in fact that we just lingered for much longer than we would normally do over breakfast. Ours was a ' superior ' room and whilst being very comfortable, was quite compact. The pool is calm and peaceful and very welcome after a busy sight seeing day. The location of the hotel is perfect as most important locations are within walking distance (or borrow/hire bicycles from the hotel). The only thing that would have made the stay perfect was if our bed could have been made properly, without any creases in the too large quilt cover for the quilt, & if the bottom sheet had been properly laid on the mattress so it could be firmly tucked in. I had to remake the bed on our first 2 nights & yes I could have called someone to do it, but we were ready for bed & had already got in to go to sleep, so it was just quicker & easier to do it myself. I told reception about it after the 2nd night & certainly it was better on the 3rd night, but I still had to readjust the (now better fitting) quilt cover to get rid of the creases on the underside of the quilt. It is really not difficult to make a bed and in a hotel like this it should be perfect. Once the bedding was properly in place, we slept really well as the beds are very comfortable.

They will say \"Bonjour\" wherever you are, reception, bar, restaurant and even housekeeping says it! I questioned this when I stayed at the Sofitel in Budapest last year and they explained that as Sofitel is the top brand within the Accor (French) hotel chain, this is therefore an instruction they receive from their head office in Paris to welcome all clients with the French Bonjour... But of course do it when you know a guest is French but when I stay at the NH Barbizon Palace I will not be greeted with a \"Buenos dias\" referring to their Spanish heritage. (I think it is clear from the above that France will never be my chosen holiday destination lol) But too many lines spend already on the the bad, back to the REALLY good: - Location = 10 minutes from Central Station - In red light district but as soon as you enter their courtyard, you honestly wouldn\u00c2\u00b4t know! (Red light district is traditionally one of the safest areas of Amsterdam due to huge police presence) - This hotel is pure luxury but at the same time VERY suitable for people that can afford luxury hotels but don\u00c2\u00b4t want the snobbish part of it. (eg Ritz London, Four Seasons George V Paris etc) This really does not mean though that this is not a top hotel, but it just feels naturally chilled. The staff have a uniform that does not involve ties but still look EXTREMELY smart so again not sure who came up with the idea but TOPCLASS. Upon arrival we were greeted by the doorman who took care of our luggage and brought us to reception where the very friendly Front desk staff checked us in quick and we were taken to our room by a member of staff. the luggage at that point had already arrived there. The rooms were immaculately clean and spacious and while it may seem strange, but I was travelling with a female colleague and the room she was given was really a feminine room with soft tones and just girly chairs etc, while mine was with open brick work, hence giving it a more masculine feeling. Really liked this touch but not sure if it was done on purpose or if this was pure coincidence but nevertheless nice. In the room there were 2 apples on a plate which were really juicy and nice. Also the turn down service is just nice but naturally is expected from a real 5 star but again the little chocolate was delicious. The bathrooms we had were with walk-in shower only but apparently this is with all the base rooms and from the luxury rooms onwards the rooms come with bath. For me this was not a problem and think most business people would not waste their time in a bath tub anyway. The room was also equipped with a Krupps coffee machine and a dvd player. The beds... oh the beds... Westin\u00c2\u00b4s heavenly and Marriott beds are nice and comfy but I never had a problem getting up, here however 3 mornings in a row I overslept!!! Eventhough I got my wake up calls and my phone alarm snoozed me twice I was almost late for my meetings 3 times... So due to the above I only managed breakfast once, which was a shame as it was really diverse and plentiful. Again the staff amazing with eye for detail, if my cup as not even half full it was topped up again so really really EXCELLENT! Large selection of cheeses, meats and juices and a large hot buffet too. Anyway, I have stayed in many hotels in Amsterdam but this by far tops them all. As for the people that call this hotel expensive, yes there are 5 star hotels in town that are cheaper (NH Grand Krasnapolsky, Marriott, Renaissance etc) but for me these hotels are not the real 5 star hotels of Amsterdam. (and comparing the rates of Sofitel to the Pulitzer, Dylan, De L\u00c2\u00b4Europe or the Amstel Intercontinental, I found their rates to generally either match or are better but maybe I have been lucky. lol) Anyway to finish off, if you have the chance: You cannot go wrong here, definitely recommend this place for a good night sleep and top class experience!", "Date": "May 22, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Hemel Hempstead, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cWell worth it...\u201d", "Author": "Boyds_TSB", "ReviewID": "UR107687062", "Content": "A beautiful Hotel from start to finish.

It is not an 'ordinary' Sofitel hotel, it is a so called Sofitel Legend hotel, which just a few Sofitel hotels get awarded with. The hotel was really nicely decorated over the X-mas session 2010. After a few discrepancies (expedia made an error concerning the room category), which were handled in a real professional way by the young receptionists, our butler Domingo showed us the way to our Imperial Suite. All in all, the check-in was fast, professional and moreover all A-Club Platinum benefits were given. They even went a step further than the published Platinum benefits (one room category upgrade) and did not walk us for the last days - many thanks to Mr. Hogetoorn for this pre-X-mas-present ;) Rating: 9.5/10 Location The location is exceptional - you are in the middle of Amsterdam when you step outside of the hotel. All main sightseeing attractions are close by. To compare it with their immediate competitor the IC Amstel, it is much more convenient and you really can feel the old charm of the city of Amsterdam when you stroll through the iconic canals just outside of the hotel. Rating: 9.5/10 Service The service is top-notch. First of all I really have to say a big thank you to Domingo. He was here for us whenever we needed something and w/o him we probably would have spent X-mas in Amsterdam due to the snow chaos. Compared to other properties, which offer butler service like the Burj al Arab, the Touessrok or the Townhouse Galleria, the butler service at the Sofitel The Grand was much more private and all in all much better than at the mentioned former properties. Also the guys at the reception greeted me every morning by name (but next time please not so formal :p) and also did a great job, as I already have mentioned. Service compared to the IC Amstel was also much better. Clear win for The Grand again. Rating: 10/10 Food Breakfast is compared to other hotels maybe a bit pricy but definitely worth it. You get champagne as well as nearly everything you could dream of. As far as I remember, I just missed a natural yoghurt there on one day. Room service is also efficient and tasty. We had dinner always outside at awesome restaurants due to the suggestions of Domingo. Rating: 8.5/10 Room I just say Imperial Suite. Well, the room was really cool. Big living room with working desk, 2 Nespresso machines, steam bath, awesome bed (I need such a bed at home too, so ship it over to me lol), 3 LCD TVs and so on and so on. The best thing is when you simply scroll through my pictures, then you will get the impression of this room ;) Compared to the IC Amstel, where we had an Executive Suite, the Imperial Suite was definitely bigger - around 110sqm - but still lacked a few things. I missed a bathroom scale and maybe some more amenities like a toothbrush. But I have to admit that you will get such things when you say it to your butler. Maybe a running map in pocket design could maybe also be provided in the room. But everything else, from the fine towels to the Hermes toiletries, was just outstanding.

I hope that person didn't have a problem getting their room. My room wasn't ready (not surprising since it was actually someone else's room) so they agreed to store my luggage. Beware that their luggage storage appears to be just leaving all of the luggage in the main reception. I sat in the reception for about an hour before leaving for a meeting, and my suitcase remained with the piles of others out in the open the whole time. The room was absolutely tiny. I was traveling on business and supposedly had a superior room. There was just enough space on either side of the bed for a useless bedside table (not actually large enough for placing anything there), and that was it. The bed was a double size bed, not a queen or king. In other words, the bed is only a bit bigger than a single size bed and certainly far too small for two people. There was barely enough room between the end of the bed and the desk to squeeze through. The bathroom was a good size, with a nice walk in shower, but no bath tub. There was no wireless internet service. Instead you had to buy (at a hefty charge) a little scratch off card from the front desk for a local wireless service, but after many attempts I still could not get this to work because the wireless signal did not reach the room. They sent someone to the room but he could not get it to work either. It is absolutely unacceptable for a hotel that pretends to be 5 star not to have internet access.

They didn't bother to order a cab until the last minute - even though we had to be punctual and had ordered the cabs with them at least a day in advance. They got the bike renting so wrong that it was just pathetic and ruined our last morning there. And just in case you think this was perhaps a \"one-off\", we ordered coffee in the lounge. They forgot to bring it. When they did bring it, it was wrong. And they forgot the cake to go with it. Frankly, and as I explained to them at the time, their hotel is let down by the management staff at every level. Interestingly, they agreed with me!

The Imperial Suite was enormous and extraordinarily luxurious -- one of the largest hotel rooms in which I've ever stayed, and the suite was replete with fresh flowers everywhere, free gifts of wine, fresh fruit and bottled water, 1.5 baths, monstrous living quarters, a glorious master bathroom, a changing room, a steam shower, butler service, modern electronics everywhere, and THE most comfortable bed and pillows I think I've ever experienced. All the furnishings in the suite were modern and very new ... so much so that we actually considered whether we were the very first people to stay in that particular suite since it was refurbished. The hotel is very nice generally, but this upgraded room (which retails for about 3 to 4 times what we paid for our \"Prestige Suite\") helped make our stay in Amsterdam unforgettable. If you can justify the splurge on the Imperial Suite, book it for a memorable experience. (In case there's more than one Imperial Suite, ask for the William the 5th Suite.) Aside from the remarkable room, the hotel extrance is an old-style very \"grand\" courtyard, which leads into a modernly furnished and attractive lobby. The staff was outstanding throughout the entire stay. Areas of the newly refurbished Spa were still under construction at the time we were there, but The Grand offers a good-sized indoor pool -- quite unusual in Europe -- which was open and wonderful. The only potentially negative we experienced was the corridors. While they look very clean, they are definitely old-style and had a slightly musty smell. This wasn't a problem for us because those same hallways led to our extremely clean and glorious suite. But the hallways did create a rather unusual dichotomy: Old-style architecture and entrance courtyard, very modern lobby, old-style corridors, very modern suite. Not a problem, just unusual.

I didnt realise the hotel was literally on the edge of the red light district, for many people that wouldnt be a problem but at a weekend especially the whole area is crawling with drunken stag party revellers, unfortunately many are British using foul language and flouting any drinking in the street laws etc etc. Not what I wanted from a romantic weekend away, I am sure that during the week this wouldnt be too much of an issue and anyway instead of turning right from the hotel just turn left, it is different again and you see the real Amsterdam.

If both ladies read this review, many thanks. we have both had treatments in many other places, but both agreed that these 2 were the tops I also went for a swim before my massage; nice pool, nice changing rooms; adequate to stretch off any jet lag. There is also a small reasonably equipped gym, and a couple of sauna cabins. the hotel is located just on the edge of the red light area, and you have to go through this area to get to Dam Sq, but its not threatening as it once was several years ago, and there were plenty of police in evidence. prostitution is clearly legal in Holland, and the site of scantily dressed women touting for business in the infamous Amsterdam glass doorways is not for the faint hearted.

We were directed upstairs to a comfortable lounge (the bar is apparently being refurbished) and we were well looked after by the pleasant barman 'til about 1.30, tho we were the only ones in the lounge.

Upon our arrival our taxi from the airport tried to overcharge us - a few guys from the hotel acted on our behalf and intervened (without us even asking!) and we ended up paying the correct amount. On the way back to the airport they made sure we got an honest taxi driver and a nice cab. That's service! My only gripe would be that the concierge was a bit inconsistent. They certainly tried hard but sometimes the advice on where to eat with our seven year old was a bit off (more bar like that we wanted) BUT when I asked for a list of toy and clothing stores for children he did some research and complied a list (some places which were great - others not so much). A for effort! When I asked for something to be brought to my room, they were there within 1 min of hanging up the phone.

So make sure you communicate the correct hotel name to your driver if you're going to stay there. The hotel itself was a historic and magnificent site.

The decor and furniture looked a bit old-fashioned at first (e.g. colorful / patterned draperies, tapestry sofa, oak table, etc.), but we actually quite liked them after a while as the ambience was cozy and very different from other contemporary / modern hotels we had previously stayed in. The most important thing was we felt comfortable in the suite. The courtyard (from our window) was nice - would be relaxing to have a walk around there. However, as the weather was rather cold and rainy, we did not spend time out there during our stay. The hotel offered turn-down service in the early evening. Some people might not like it but we were fine and appreciated it. We also enjoyed a complimentary welcome drink at the restaurant. Hotel staff were friendly and helpful. We bought our tickets to the Van Gogh Museum at the reception / concierge (to avoid line-up at the museum).

Great location, nice and central for everything, staff friendly and yes you can ask for more tea and coffee sachets, as mentioned in previous reviews on this forum. Top tips, if flying into schipol - get the 3.60 euro train ticket to centraal station - you can walk from there to hotel v.quickly. Also, although Amsterdam is very small and you can walk to most - the 24 or 48 hour tram tourer tickets are great value - the trams are so easier to pick up and clean and you can see a lot more. I think it was 6 euros ish for 24 hours and 10 euros for 48 hours - you need to get them stamped by conductor on first usage.

The apartment itself was nice - definitely a bit more on the antiquey, English style but no complaints about the decor. The living room overlooked the canal, so we got a bit of noise from revellers but the bedroom was very quiet. Ordered quite a bit from room service - not the cheapest option but not as outrageous as hotels in New York or London. Good location in Central Amsterdam, within easy walking distance to all the major sights. Only a couple of complaints: our room had an Ethernet connection but in a part of the apartment that had no desk or chairs, so not very easy to get any work done or check online for sights. The other was the disappointing water pressure in the shower. All in all, minor inconveniences, especially since I wasn't really there to work.

The room was elegant and stylish. The view of the small canal from the room was a nice bonus. The common areas of the hotel, particularly the courtyard, were gorgeous. The location is OK, not bad, not great. The air-conditioning was somewhat feeble in our room, bringing the temperature to about 72 degrees or so only when set at about 50 degrees. I wanted badly to think of this as the 5-star hotel that it attempts to be. BUT... The service was spotty. Everyone that we encountered was very pleasant, and the concierge was very useful, especially as they sold tickets to the Anne Frank House, the Van Gogh museum, and the Rijksmuseum, the 3 attractions in Amsterdam most likely to generate a line at the door for tickets. The ability to get the tickets from the concierge was a nice bonus. The front desk staff was pleasant enough as well; that was not the problem. Check-in, when we arrived, was OK, a little slow, but not enough so as to put up a fuss. When I attempted to exchange some currency at the desk, however, it took about 20 minutes to do so (and there was no line at the desk). The desk clerk seemed repeatedly distracted by doing other things, and was not really focusing on making the exchange for us. Even when he did it, for whatever reason, he was repeatedly shuffling papers, as if distracted. Regardless, I didn't think much of it. It was check-out that I found to be a fiasco. I called down to have our bags brought down and to have a taxi called to take us to the train station. I was assured that a taxi would be called and that it would be waiting for us after we checked out. We followed the bags down shortly. There was one person in front of me in line checking out already. I waited for about 10 minutes for this person to check out, as there appeared to be an endless amount of paper shuffling once again, by a different front desk clerk. When I arrived at the desk to check out, it took another 10 minutes or so to check me out as well, with the same paper shuffling routine as well as the desk clerk disappearing to the back for a few minutes for whatever reason. After finally getting checked out, we exited to the front, where no taxi was waiting, despite the fact that about 25 minutes had passed since I was assured on the phone that a cab would be called immediately. I asked the bellboy/doorman about the cab, and he replied that he knew that we were going to the train station and that a taxi had been called and would be there any minute. About 10 more minutes passed, and I asked him again about the taxi. He replied that he had just called for one, implying that he had not called earlier and had not been frank about it initially. We then waited another 10 minutes or so before the taxi arrived. Needless to say, we needed to hustle a little to catch our train when we got to the station. Now, I am not snobby or snooty about hotels, travel, or service. I am simply being frank about this, because I don't think that the process of checking out and getting a taxi for transportation should take the better part of an hour, not at a hotel that fancies itself a five star luxury hotel and not at $500 per night.

I had done a lot of internet research on hotels and prices, and this looked perfect - and it was. We have three teenage children and so needed two rooms, which really increases the cost of lodging -- but still wanted a four or five star experience. As noted by the other readers, this hotel is lovely, professional and comfortable, and treated our children with as much respect as they did adults. We had one courtyard room (junior suite, with room for a single bed in the small tv/changing room), which was wonderfully quiet, and a canal room which had minimal noise. The deciding factor for us in choosing this hotel was that it is air conditioned, and this proved to be important - it was quite hot the week we were there, and to come back to an air conditioned room after walking for hours, and look out over a beautiful, tree and flower filled courtyard, was lovely. Friends of ours stayed at one of the canal hotels, which they found quite charming but quite hot. We wanted to arrive in Africa well-rested, and air conditioning made sleeping much more comfortable. I found a very good rate on premierhotels.com, which included breakfast - breakfast is very expensive separately, and we would not have done it otherwise, but it turned out to be one of those experiences that really make a travel day. It is a comprehensive buffet with fresh orange juice and incredible hot chocolate, and was a wonderful way to start the day. It also allowed us to eat a light tea/snack in early afternoon, and then a more substantial dinner. We had both tea and lunch in the courtyard restaurant, and both were excellent - although a little pricey. Even though we booked through an internet website and I was anxious about every aspect of the reservation, we had absolutely no problems, including with the price. It's still a good idea to bring written confirmation, though, since it makes it easier for everyone when you're holding an actual document. As for location, the red light district literally began at the end of the block, but there was almost no spill-over of activity, and it was easy to avoid it. We did walk the edges a number of times, and it provided a great opportunity for our small-town kids to see another side of life and a very natural way for us to talk with them more about those kinds of activities.

The room was a fair size with a huge bathroom, free slippers and gowns (as you would expect). Tried the room service which was expensive but again well presented and the food was excellent. With regards to beakfast (26 euros) it wasn't the biggest breakfast I have seen but there was smoked salmon, eggs, mushrooms etc. Used the gym a few times but to be honest the gym was a left down, it only had a running machine, cross trainer and bike (but enough for a quick workout if you feel guilty afer all the food). Finally in summary expenisive but by far the smartest hotel in Amsterdam.", "Date": "November 2, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "2", "Service": "4", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Birmingham", "Title": "\u201cGood but overpriced\u201d", "Author": "cs0025", "ReviewID": "UR4017006", "Content": "I stayed at The Grand with my wife on a short break.

Our welcome was excellent making us feel as though we had definitely made the right choice. All the staff were friendly throughout the stay although we had a few blips with level of service which is a shame as the hotel has a lot of the ingredients to make it excellent. The location is interesting! In a beautiful building with a lot of history. Be warned though, it is VERY close to the red light district. We are certainly not prudes but the location of the hotel meant that, mainly in the evenings, the area was full of large groups of men on what seemed like 'lads nights out'! I also hate to say that a lot of them were English too who seemed to have had a sherry too many!! Hence lots of noise and lager drinking in the bars nearby the hotel!! Not conducive to a romantic night out!! On our last evening the gas in the hotel kitchens went out and therefore the menu in the restaurant was extremely limited. We had to revert to room service (again a restricted menu because of the problem) and no apology was made for this inconvenience. In our mind the hotel should have given notice that there was a problem so that we had time to make alterntiave arrangements (apparently it had been out all day). Not good for a 5 star hotel. We would return with a group of mates for fun weekend. We wouldn't return for a romantic weekend away with a partner!!", "Date": "September 26, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "San Francisco, CA", "Title": "\u201cHistoric, Charming, Central, and Worth the Stars\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR3844595", "Content": "My husband and I were in Amsterdam for several days. We got a good deal at this otherwise pricey hotel (stay 4 nights, 1 night is free). The rooms and service were really 5-star, especially by European standards. The room and bathroom had all the amenities. The staff was courteous and always helpful. The turndown service with hotel slippers and chocolates made us feel very special. They were helpful in confiming our flights and making reservations for us. Try to get breakfast included, as it is a very nice European spread in their upscale French restaurant, inclusive of cappuccinos or whatever you want. The hotel is quite historic and has been around more than 5 centuries, first as a convent, then as Town Hall. The Queen was married at this hotel. If you are looking for a place which is charming, does not feel like a large chain hotel, and is luxurious, stay here. Our friends who stayed at the more modern Dylan found it to be \"hip,\" but the rooms were dirtied (the white sofa was no longer white and the walls and furniture there were scuffed) and the staff there was not as helpful. The Grand is very central and we did not need to take a cab or public transportation anywhere.

I do not regret my choice as The Grand was truly grand! Everything; the hotel grounds, my room, the staff, the location could not have been any better. From the first moment I walked off the busy street into the beautiful quite courtyard I knew this place was special from top to bottom.Simply breathtaking. It was like walking into royalty, into history, my very own centuries old estate. Pleasant, finely dressed, prompt and professional staff greeted me at every turn with a smile and there was a lot of staff. One young man even gave me tour of the various old rooms used in history for weddings, meetings etc. etc. Another gave me an umbrella when it rained, arranged a massage, and recomfirmed my appointments. Treated like a guest should be treated. My room was spacious and comfortable. I remember reading other reviews criticizing the old wall paper and decor but to be honest after being in The Swiss Hotel in Berlin and the Hotel Joseph in Prague it was nice to be in a older classic setting so I had no problem with this at all. The bed was great and the bathroom very nice with all of the Roger and Gallet products I could possibly fit into my suitcase!! Add a canal view, fluffy bathrobe and slippers, and I was in heaven. Oh, and the turn down service every night with a yummy chocolate, and slippers placed on the floor by the head of my bed was just over the top. Stunning! Whenever I left my room be it a stroll in my bathrobe to the spa or for a day or night out on the town, I chose to walk down the marvelous stained glass staircase fantasizing about all famous people who too had descended those stairs. The sense of history was prevalent throught this hotel. The garden was very nice too. Nice extras: a business center with 4 computer terminals and free internet usage, unlike all the other hotels I was in that had only one terminal and a lot of waiting time to use them. Not here. Also this hotel never felt crowded or rushed or busy. (I had thought about staying in the Krasnapolsky and I'm so glad I did not choose that train station; they were so busy and crowded and full of people pushing and shoving and THEIR business center charged quite a fee for internet usage.) The location of the Grand was unbelievable; easy tram access, right near Dam Sqaure but totally away from all of the craziness, next to one the best coffeshops in town, across the canal from my favorite restaurant \"van Kerkwijk\", and short walks to all of the nicest parts of the center city, the red light area, as well as the Rembrandtplain, Leidisplain etc. In addition, the security at night was top notch... The Grand was truly grand in everyway, I had a magical stay, and I highly recommend it.", "Date": "August 24, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "5.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Augusta, GA", "Title": "\u201cGreat Hotel....Great Location\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR3768855", "Content": "My wife and I just got back from a post cruise 2-night stay at The Grand and could not have been happier.

The moment we entered the courtyard at the Sofitel (July 14, 2005) we knew that this was heaven - no matter where you turn on the property there is someone to meet your every need - you will be hard pressed to find that kind of hotel staff anywhere, even in North America. We stayed in a junior suite which was way more space then we needed but the bed is to die for. The best European bed you can get with great maid service. There is a pool which children love, (with lots of towels) as well as a dry sauna, steam, and a gym. The room amenities are top notch complete with slippers to wear whilst you make your way to the spa. The gym isn't top notch but if you need a work out it will do. A bonus is free internet access to a computer room what a great idea for a hotel and you meet the nicest people in there. Good way to make your way back to trip advisor! I am told the restuarant is the best - and although we did want to go, our 8 year cannot sit still for that amount of time to let others enjoy their food so we opted out. As books say it is only a block from the red light district and no worries about that - you would never know and security is it's finest in the evening as well as during the day. Amsteram is very much a walking city and we did not take a tram once - so even to get to Vondelpark, the Van Gogh, Anne Frank's House you can walk everywhere - there is a great variety of restaurants in the neighborhood - and I can tell you what a treat it was to come home to the Sofitel for 4 evenings with friendly staff - a fresh basket full of apples each day at reception and the beds to die for. If you are carrying hardly any luggage you can walk it from the train station. Also a good tip is to buy tickets to Anne Frank's House, the museums etc you can do that at the concierge at the Sofitel - will save time lining up somewhere else - and there is no surcharge for this service. You also meet the nicest guests right in the lobby - I am sure that is because of the staff - there is very much a relaxed feeling at the Sofitel. We will go back again and again when we return to Amsterdam - the stay wouldn't be complete without the Grand Demeure.
