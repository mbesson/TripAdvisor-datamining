Allocated room 329 on third floor overlooking the back of the hotel & Decathon store below. Room was a good size and plenty of storage space and fridge/minibar. I was handed an offers card on checkin which advertised the full minibar for 9.72 euro which is very good value if you wanted to empty it !!! There was also offers to upgrade room to superior for 16.20 euro or to a junior suite for 37.80 euro which seemed good value. Bed was lovely & big & long and very comfortable to sleep in. Blackout curtains were good & provided a good night's sleep. As rear facing there was absolutely no noise except from some kids in the morning going to breakfast from nearby rooms. There was 3 lifts to the 6 floors which seemed like a lot but we still had to wait for one on Sunday when checking out. Bathroom was up to the usual NH standard & pretty adequate, small amount of shampoo & shower gels which were replaced after use. Good sized tub & shower was fine too. Breakfast was not included in my rate but there are plenty of coffee shops & bars nearby for morning coffee & croissants both mornings ( less so on the Sunday) There is 30 minutes free wifi in the lobby but no free internet to print off boarding passes & reception did not seem to want to help only pointing to pay internet service which was 5 euro......did print off boarding passes at internet shop near Placa Reial for 25 cents... most hotels do now offer a free facility for this service nowadays, take note NH Hotels.

Lots of places to eat .. walk around 5-10 minutes to Picasso place, and still can walk until we reach La Musica de Palau and other market (not the one at the RA Lambra, forget the name already). Just 2-3 minutes walk to La Rambla and we can walk down to beach and also to the Maritime Museum. On our last day, we were rushing as we were looking for Caleum cafe around Barri Gothic.

Although rated a 3 star hotel, it has all the amenities you will need, including free wi-fi. Very safe, well lit area of downtown Barcelona. Reception desk staff speak good English and are very helpful. Next time we are going to Barcelona, NH Duc de la Victoria Hotel is definitely where we are going to stay. A walk on Passeo de Gracia to visit the Gaudi houses Casa Batllo and La Pedrera will take no more than 15 minutes. About half an hour walk to Gaudi's Sagrada Familia Cathedral. Quick tips: - if you are a smoker, ask for a smoking room WITH a balcony - there is a little food store just around the corner (on the street leading to the Cathedral) that has everything you need including cold beer, wine, liquor, etc. - open 8:30 am - 830 pm - for greater choice there is a Carrefour food store on La Rambla just 5 minutes away from the hotel - parking IS a problem but the hotel has an arrangement with the underground parking lot at the Cathedral (25 euro/day as opposed to the regular 45 euro/day)", "Date": "November 19, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "San Jose, California", "Title": "\u201cGreat location\u201d", "Author": "los4caracoles", "ReviewID": "UR120555379", "Content": "Walk to Las Ramblas and all kinds of little shops!

If you're considering a stay in Barcelona I can thoroughly recommend this hotel and we will certainly stay here again when we return to the city. Firstly, location. Set in a quiet area of the old town near to the cathedral, a 2 minutes walk from La Ramblas and 5 from Placa Catalunya, this hotel is ideally suited for visiting many of the local attractions and enjoying the night-life. Placa Catalunya is the terminus for the airport bus (Aerobus) and takes 25 minutes to reach this central city square at a cost of 8.30 euros one way. The hotel is away from roads and the only vehicles allowed near it are taxis, delivery lorries and bikes, so it is relatively quiet at night although there is always a chance of noise from revelers until the early hours. Don't be put off by pictures from Google Earth which at street level suggest a dark, deserted environment. I don't know when they took the footage but you'll find that the sides of the Carrer (passage way) are lined with shops behind those roller blinds and there is an exciting vibrancy to the whole area. Placa Catalunya is also the starting point for the two tour bus companies and we found it worth while investing in a two day pass that gave us free access to the buses which leave every 10 minutes and stop at numerous places around their routes to pick up and drop off. We used our first abd second morning to take north and south tours and then the afternoons to revisit places of interest we wanted to see. Hotel rooms: As your research will tell you, hotel rooms in Barcelona tend to be smaller than average. That said we found our room large enough to meet our needs. It was well cleaned and well appointed. The twin beds were larger than the British equivalent and speaking as an over six-footer, I was more than comfortable. The bathroom was well planned for the space and all we wanted. Breakfast: Wonderful - a great range of Spanish foods - mostly cold buffet but some hot. I was dismayed by some reviews I'd read about not being able to get a 'cooked breakfast'. Really, if you want a full English - stay in England or get yourself out to one of the Irish pubs and pay a bit extra. The breakfast hours are strictly adhered to which allows prices to be kept to a minimum. Not a problem for most but I did overhear one couple complaining because they'd booked a coach tour that left before breakfast started and were rather forcefully and repeatedly asking the receptionist what she was going to do about it. In the USA you might well expect some form of 'positive' response but not in Spain; and that's not an indication of rudeness - far from it, we found the people of Barcelona helpful and friendly. Safety: We read far too much in reviews about pick pockets. We felt as safe as in any other major European city. We always keep our eyes open especially in tight crowds but were perfectly safe. Just don't openly make yourself a target by having wallets bulgingly on display. Think! The hotel has free to use safes in every room. Make use of them and only take out what you need and a bit more. Leave your passport as well, you don't need it with you once you've checked in.", "Date": "November 7, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cFab hotel with great location\u201d", "Author": "CitybreakNiki", "ReviewID": "UR120224962", "Content": "A fabulous well located hotel!

We crossed the street from the Aerobus Placa Catalunya stop onto Avinguda del Porta de I'Angel (see a large thermometer on a building), walked the slightly down inclined Avinguda del Porta de I'Angel street (this was the longest part of the walk past small shops and musicians and an El Ingles Corte store), made the first right onto Carrer de la Canuda (the signage was not good for this street, but you will see the red awning of a Periodicos stand on your left which you can't miss and the lettering: Thomas Cookon the building on your right), then the first left onto the short street Carrer del Duc and the hotel is on your right. The staff were extremely helpful in giving us directions to the sights, Aerobus schedules, metro and bus lines and stops to use. There was a security guard in the lobby on Sunday when we checked in and every night he made rounds throughout the hotel. We did not take the breakfast option for 14 Euros each since we went to local pastry shops and the market for our breakfast which was about 1/3 of the cost. We used the small food store across from the hotel to buy fruit and water very reasonably too. A few things to know about the rooms are: 1) It is like other European hotels that are green. When you enter your room, your key needs to go in the slot next to the door/light switch; this turns the lights and water on. Remember to take it out when you exit the room. 2) There is no clock or alarm in the room, but the staff was great about doing wake-up calls for us. 3) There are no dressers to put clothing in. The closet has a hanging section on one side of it and shelves on the other side to place clothes. 4) There is a safe is in the closet. We would definitely stay here again. 5) The modern marble tiled bathroom was supplied with shampoo, shower gel, soap, facial sponge, toothbrush and pocket tissues. The supplies were replenished as needed. 6) The balcony was narrow and only large enough for 2 people to stand on it and overlooked the street.", "Date": "November 3, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Brighton, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cFriendly, helpful, fantastic location!\u201d", "Author": "K_B_49_11", "ReviewID": "UR120072466", "Content": "One of the most helpful reception desks I've been to!

Our (non smoking) room was not ready when we arrived late morning (not unexpected as check in/out is noon) but the desk staff stowed our bags so we could stroll around to get our bearings. The hotel, as many others have said is ideally located,just a couple of minutes walk off La Rambla and a short distance from Placa Catalunya, the central hub of the city. Having returned from a refreshing beer and some tapas in a nearby bar, we returned shortly after noon & our room was ready. It was on the first floor and overlooked the internal courtyard of the hotel. No view but we did not mind as this was also expected form other reviews. If you want a view, you may need to specify this in advance. Reception offer you breakfast at check in but we declined. You get 10% discount for booking the buffet breakfast at check in but the cost is quite high at nearly 15 euros. We found an alternative restaurant on La Rambla next to the Royal hotel and used by their guests at 12 euros per head which was a little better. Alternatively, La Bocqueria market has fruit, baguettes for much cheaper, lighter breakfast. The rooms are clean, modern and functional. Quite small but perfectly adequate for a couple just needing a comfortable bed and bathroom with good shower. Note, the shower gel bottle is small and doesn't go far if you like the lather up! You may wish to bring extra! The minibar in the room is available at a cost but a better option is to use the minimarket opposite the hotel. A large 1.5 L bottle of water is 80cents, not 2 euros for a 0.5L bottle in the minibar. Cold beers also available in the market for about a third of the cost in the minibar. Please note that Barcelona is an expensive city. You will need to expect to have open wallet surgery performed on you if you don't be careful! We did the open top, hop on/off bus tour at 30 euros per person for a 2 day pass (23 euros for a 1 day pass.) The bus tours start at Placa Catalunya, 5 min walk from the hotel.This was an excellent way to get around the city so we did the three different city loops on the first day to see the sights and then used the second day to get off at our selected stops. The tour ticket includes a booklet with various discounts at museums/restaurants and attractions so can save you quite a lot. A recommended restaurant is \"Les Quinze Nits\" in Placa Reial, halfway down La Rambla, turn left into this picturesque square surrounded by bars, restaurants and street entertainers performing. The food was very reasonable and good quality. It was the only restaurant on the square with a regular queue of diners. That has to say something! On checkout we left the bags in reception for later collection so we could explore on our last day. The hotel was ideal for us and we would not hesitate to return. For travel to and from the airport, use the aerobus which stops at Place Catalunya. One way ticket is 5.3 euros per person, return 9.20 (they don't advertise the return price, valid for 7 days on the price board at the airport so \"y buelta, por favor\" will get you the return price!

We were travelling with my mother who had a room a few doors down, same problem in there. I checked with reception for another room but was told the hotel was full and no other rooms were available. Clothes and bedding in the room always had a damp feeling too, so was glad to get into the sun of Barcelona in the mornings. Dont get me wrong, the hotel served its purpose.

I wasn\u2019t expecting too much from it (I got a reasonable rate and it was in a good location in the city in July\u2014Superior Room Advanced Purchase and it was in a central location). It was located near Placa Catalunya between Portal de l\u2019Angel and Ramblas (the 2 pedestrian boulevards). I will say, though, that at night I wouldn\u2019t have wanted to walk back to our hotel alone only because the area immediately around it was completely shut down and kind of deserted late, but it was fine. The hotel wished us a happy anniversary upon our arrival (had asked if we were celebrating anything when I booked and I guess they record that for check-in). Our room was very comfortable with a nice sized bathroom, hardwood floors, and we were on a corner, so we had 2 small balconies (they weren\u2019t really big enough to sit on with a chair or anything, but still nice), and the room was very clean. They had put some candies and a bottle of water in our room complementary, as well. The hotel also gave a password for 30 mins of free internet access (only worked in the lobby) every day, as well. My husband asked the desk for a recommendation for tapas, and the place the receptionist recommended was so good that we ended up eating there 4 times while we were there (and therefore didn\u2019t eat much else in all of Barcelona haha). We did look around other places, but this place definitely had the most appealing looking tapas. It was called Ciudad Condal If you follow Ramblas up (away from the water) a block past Placa Catalunya, then when it splits there, stay right for one more block, it is on the corner of Gran Via de les Cortes Catalanes--across both directions of traffic on the right on the corner next to the place called OBAMA (ironically). They had good small pitchers of sangria (makes about 3 glasses), cheap beers and wine, great tapas and specials, etc. The bar gets CROWDED, bu you can also sit, and still get tapas or a selection from the bar (or from the menu--can ask for an English menu if needed). To get bar items for your table, you simply push your way to the bar after getting your table, tell them your table # (get from your server), and point our what you want and they will send it over. In the morning, go down to La Boqueria (the market) on the Ramblas-- on your right if walking in the direction of the water. It is a lot cheaper than the hotel breakfast, and you can get anything you could possibly want from an omelet to fruit salad or juice, a cappuccino, breads, pastries, cheeses and meats, etc, and there was a little area with tables and chairs. We tried Jamon Iberico there (ham from Iberian black pigs that primarily eat acorns). It is delicious, the Spaniards love their ham, but that one is not cheap. 100 grams costs between 7 and 10 euros. We loved it, though. There was a place that had it pre-packaged in 100 gram packages\u2014when you walk into the market itself, go all the way to the wall along the left-hand side and there is a shop that had pretty much all pork, we got I there. We then just got some nice rolls from one of the bakery stands and some cheese from a cheese stand and had a great little picnic breakfast. (Can do the same with Serrano ham for about \u00bd the price, but if you like ham, try Jamon Iberico at least once.) Barcelona Tips in General (if interested): I found the main sights in Barcelona to be: Gaudi\u2019s sights (Sagrada Familia Church, Casa Mila aka La Pedrera, the Block of Discord, & Park Guell), the Ramblas/the Market, the Barri Gotic/Cathedral, the Picasso Museum, and the beaches. I would say you need a minimum of 2 days and 2 nights in Barcelona to appreciate it (3 would probably be even better). In terms of organizing time, if you stay here (and like to keep moving), on my first day, I would do a walk down the Ramblas in the morning\u2014it is much more enjoyable and less congested in the morning (stopping at the market for breakfast), then take the Drassanes metro stop up to Passeig de Gracia, see the block of discord and walk 3 blocks up to Casa Mila (it is worth the admission to get on the roof, really liked it, and the apartment is interesting, too), then walk back to the Passeig de Gracia Metro stop and take the metro to Sagrada Familia (have to change once, but only 3 stops overall). Then after seeing that, take a taxi to Park Guell and wander around (about 8 euros for the taxi, park is free). I booked Casa Mila ahead, but at least when we were there, there was no major line for it, so it would have been ok to just show up (not sure if that is always the case\u2014it is a bit pricey, but you will never see another roof like that for the rest of your life). I also booked Sagrada Familia ahead (thank God). That was 500% worth it. The line to get in was INSANE when we were there (like had to be 2+ hrs wait at least). There is no way we would have waited in that, no matter how badly we wanted to see it. We cut the entire line to collect our tickets and walk right in (amazing)\u2014if you book ahead, just proceed to the ticket booth (I had my confirmation printed out), we waved it to the person organizing the kiosks and they let us straight into the front. If you want to take an elevator up to the top of the church, though, book it when you pick up your tickets because there will be a wait for that, so you can tour the place and then go to the elevator at your appointed time\u2014it was too long until the next one for us, so we just skipped it. We had booked the audioguide, too, when I ordered our tickets online which I\u2019m glad we did because it helped us to appreciate the place (but you can also just pay for one inside after you collect your ticket if you want it). A taxi is by far the easiest way to get to Park Guell from there, and relatively inexpensive. We hiked all over the park (some great view of the city), and all sorts of interesting Gaudi-esque things staggered throughout the park. Then tapas for dinner (or paella). On Day 2 I would probably go back to the market on the Ramblas for breakfast (if you liked it), then I would walk around the Barri Gotic and visit the cathedral (free until 12:45pm, after 5 euros). And then probably spend some of my day at the beach. The sandy beaches were nice, and fine to relax on a towel. When we were there, for 2 chairs it was 5 euros each and a shared umbrella was 6 euros (all day use, no \u00bd day price). We just relaxed happily on our towels in the sand for free. You could visit the Picasso museum in the evening or if you had another day. We did not make it there, but it has the most extensive collection of his early, realistic works and an encompassing collection of his different time periods, so if you are a fan, it\u2019s probably a must-see.", "Date": "August 9, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "2", "Service": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Folsom, CA", "Title": "\u201cIn the middle of the action\u201d", "Author": "JHFIII", "ReviewID": "UR116323120", "Content": "Just off Las Ramblas.

Not to miss in Barcelona - a flamenco show and if possible see the one at the Palau de la Musica which is an incredible place. Other suggestions - 1. the musical fountain 2. either renting a car or taking the Sarfa bus to Tossa Del Mar (from Estacio du Nord) and spending a day there (it's about 2 hours each way). The beach there is so beautiful (wear good sandals as the beach sand is not soft). Walk around the medieval village and enjoy one of resturants on the boardwalk. 3.

So when I finally went back to Barcelona last another, I looked no further and booked this hotel straight away. The \"weekend extender\" rate made it especially tempting, as it included breakfast, a lazy Sunday checkout (until 17h), and a free fully stocked minibar, all for a very competitive rate. The hotel was pretty much as I remembered it, but taken very litterally: nothing seemed to have changed or been renewed in the past 5 years. Whereas the hotel came across to me as completely refurbished on my previous visit, this time I clearly spotted signs of age and usage. Nothing was broken or in bad shapen, but there were scratches on the furniture, worn spots in the corridor carpet, and more generally a remote feeling that the hotel needs freshing up a little. The other thing that struck me during my second stay was the size of the rooms. Some earlier reviewers mentioned that the rooms are spacious, but if you carefully study the pictures that earlier reviewers have posted you will see for yourself that this is not true, at least not for the standard rooms. I would estimate the size of the room to be 2,5 times the size of the bed. Not cramped, but certainly not spacious either. However, if you arrive early in the afternoon you may be able to upgrade to a junior suite upon check-in for a mere 35 euros extra per night. The suites were sold out by the time I got there, but I saw pictures of it in the reception and it definately seemed like a good deal to me. Other then these two remarks I would fully recommend this hotel for its excellent location, good breakfast, the wooden floors in the rooms, the small balconies, the quiet surroundings (no cars in the streets, and few pedestrians) and the NH style of furniture which - even if slightly ageing - is much nicer than what many other hotels have to offer.", "Date": "February 23, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "London, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cPerfect Location\u201d", "Author": "dollyCork_Ireland", "ReviewID": "UR95224642", "Content": "I stayed at this hotel for 3 nights.

About 3 short blocks. We'd just arrived from Paris staying at very efficient, but small Hotel Muguet. In comparison, the NH seemed large (more like a Marriott) with a fair sized lobby and very friendly, efficient staff. I was a little leary because I did not have a hotel confirmation to reflect my triple status. I had intially booked a double and called to upgrade to triple Since they do not have a triple category, they upgraded me to suite (with sofa pullout) for an extra 35 Euros a night. I was pleasantly surprised when they pulled up reservation which accurately reflected what I was told over the phone. My room was actually very large and included a sliding door separating the single sofabed and bedroom area. Room had 3 phones and was extremely clean and comfortable. Nice closet too. Hotel had restaurant but we did not eat there. We did order Pizza in which was easy. There are many dining selections near hotel. In terms of staff, they were great. Reception was friendly and efficient. Staff was accomodating and reacted quickly to opening safe when hubby forgot PIN; maid staff was attentive to cleaning our room despite the fact that we accidentally left 'do not disturb' sign. About 5 minutes after walking in and removing the doorsign, we received call asking if we wanted maid service! Nice toiletries which were refilled everyday. They even give you sanitizer! In terms of location, it is near Las Ramblas. I do not care for that particular street other than to visit La Boquetaria market. However, you can exit through the other main street and head out to Passeig de Gracia for a different type of ambiance (less cheesy). Shops galore all around this area. I'd recommend eateries off the side streets versus Las Ramblas. These alleyways are lined with great coffee shops, tapas, and shops, shops and more shops. In terms of sites, make sure you buy tix to Music Hall in advance. This is a fantastic piece of architecture nestled in the alleyways of Barcelona. Tickets for tours were sold out for 7 days and I was crushed I could not get in. The Hop On/Hop Off Bus great if your feet are weary from having walked Paris. Also visting the Gaudi designed homes is a must for folks who appreciate novelty and architecture. Did I mention shopping? Check out Pont & Roma for quality clothing at decent prices.

This hotel was well located in a quiet street just off la ramblas. We booked British Airways flights and hotel deal combined with Lastminute.com and overall we were pleased with the deal. We only had a standard room, and although quiet small, was clean and adequate with a good sized double bed. The bathroom was perfectly serviceable, although as you stepped out of the bath, there was a pillar stuck in the way, directly in front of the loo, which made it a bit awkward. We had a mini bar in our room, which we didn't use. The restaurant was only open Mon-Fri, which we were not told about at check in. We ate breakfast at a couple of local cafe's - I would recommend choosing a busy bustling cafe that the locals use - you'll get better service and food. We tried one of the restaurants towards the end of la ramblas that did a deal of 3 tapas, paella and sangria for ten euros - you get what you pay for! The food was ok and the sangria watered down but it was our first evening there and we were hungry! We also tried a pizza place on la ramblas - again fine - nothing special. Our most fun evening was dinner in Hard Rock Cafe - not very barcelonian - but at least you know what you're getting in there and it was a good atmosphere with friendly staff. We used the bus to Parc Guell and the metro quite a lot. We went to Camp Nou for a football match - a great experience - even I enjoyed it and I don't like football! We got the metro to Monjuic and after asking directions in the cable car place, we walked ten minutes along the road for the other cable car along the port only to find it closed for the winter! So that was a bit disappointing. We did the usual Gaudi attractions, the unfinished cathedral - which we thought was expensive 11 euros to get in plus another 2.50 if you wanted to take the lift up to the top of the spire - we didn't as there was a 90 minute queue. The Pedrera was probably my favourite gaudi building - that cost about 10 euro each but there was an extra exhibition which made it a bit better value. We also ate in an all you eat buffet, which wasn't very nice and wouldn't recommend. A good cup of tea was hard to come by, coffee is more popular but its very strong. We tried the hot chocolate - nice but very rich. We used the aerobus for airport transfers at 5 euros each, each way and we also brought a T10 travel card from the machines in the underground station which were about 7.70 euro for 10 journeys and you can share it. We also went to the magic fountains - this was good - with stunning views across the city at night. Unfortunately, it was quite cold and showery when we were there - we had a good time - but I think it would be a better place to visit in warmer months. Would recommend the hotel as its perfect for access to the entire city, close to all sorts of eating places and shops. The bouqueria market was good to look round.

I prefer walking the city, it is by far the best way to take in the atmosphere and the culture, as opposed to taking the taxi/bus from one tourist attraction to the next. I even walked to Parc Guell on the other side of the city, and it was only about 30-45 minutes. The staff at the front desk were great. Very helpful. They answered all of my questions perfectly and politely. The room was very simple, but very clean and neat. All of your basic amenities are there: decent bed, television with several international stations, bathroom with shower/tub. No frills, but all the basic necessities. If you're like me, the room is just a place to sleep, and that's it. And if that's all you need it for, it's perfect. There's staff at the front desk around the clock. So even if you come into the hotel in the middle of the night (after enjoying the wonderful Barcelona nightlife) there is someone there to let you in. All and all, it was a great stay.

It's really worth spending some time in the latter just soaking in the atmosphere on a Saturday afternoon.

There is also a little general store on Carrer de la Carruda around the corner where you can pick up drinks, snacks etc, which is a bit cheaper than the mini bar.

On the positive side: The hotel has a very good location. Near to Placa Catalunya and Ramblas. A lot of major attractions are within walking distance. All types of transportation are easily available. Though inside Barri Gotic, the area near to the hotel felt safe. Being in such a position everything is easily available near to the hotel. Lot of restaurants nearby and a big branch of El Corte Ingles is three minutes walk away. Also there is a small supermarket very near to the hotel but it stays close on Sundays. Staff behaviour and attitude were very helpful and friendly. Most of them spoke good English and even when some of them did not they remained very cooperative. Breakfast quality and variety was really nice. One of the best we enjoyed during our Spain tour of twenty days. Room size was good though not very big. Even after putting in an extra bed for my son we had room to move around. Quality of bed was also good. On the not so positive side: We were given a 1st floor room when we checked in. We found a cockroach after entering the room. After a long flight we did not want to make an issue out of it and got rid of it on our own. But on the second day after coming back to the room in the evening we found another big one moving around. Upon complaining to the reception people they promptly shifted us to a fifth floor room, where we did not have any problem for the rest of our stay. My suggestion is if you are staying in this hotel avoid the 1st floor as the hotel has its breakfast room on the same floor, which may have caused our problem. Lack of room service, particularly during the weekend caused us some problems but as there are lot of options nearby it should not be a problem until and unless you are very tired and do not want to leave the room.

The location was right around the corner from Las Ramblas, close to the main areas and touristy spots. We were a little wary of staying so close to Las Ramblas because there were quite a few comments on tripadvisor about the noise when you book a hotel in this area, however the NH Duc is about 1-2 blocks off of the main street, and we were never bothered from the noise at all. The room was very clean, and spacious. We had a superior room with a king sized bed, and found the room and the washroom to be a nice size, and recently renovated. While it wasnt a bargain to stay here, at approx $250 US per night, it was definitely a nice place. If you are looking to see a lot of sites within a couple of days, I would definitely recommend purchasing the 'hop on hop off' double decker bus tickets, we were able to see so much of Barcelona in a short time, and it was very easy and stree free. Narrated explanations of all the sites in a variety of languages make it very tourist-friendly. The main pick-up/drop-off area for these buses were only a couple blocks away. The only thing I would recommend against is purchasing breakfast from the hotel. It was 15 euros per person, and only provided a small buffet of cold dishes. Perhaps I am just not used to European breakfast tastes, but I did not find it was good value for the cost. About 3 minutes away there are many little cafes and restaurants along the Ramblas that offer much better value, and even a couple who served traditional hot English breakfasts with eggs, etc for half the price.

It is funny how some things will bother one person and not another. The church bells that we hear from the distance are driving my husband crazy. For me, why is it in a day and age of satelites I am stuck with CNN from London as my only english language TV choice? Silly I know but other than that, I agree that the rooms are small but they are immaculate. Apparently it has been unseasonably warm here so the air conditioning has not been turned on yet.

When we inquired about the warm temperature in the room, we were told the AC is going on next week. It is a drag to need another shower after your shower never mind your makeup melting before you finish putting it on. Another thing to be aware about is that don't discard the envelope that your room keys come in. You need it to gain entrance to the hotel restaurant despite what appears to be a list of guests and their corresponding room numbers.The restaurant staff are short of obsessive in seeing it to let you in in the morning. One morning, my husband showed his license with the room key and you could see them starting to stress about it. Needless to say I got another one (without an issue).

We paid 164 euros per night. Maybe a bit pricey for a 3 star hotel, but it was really a 3+. We felt that the hotel's many positives made it a very good value. The rooms and lobby are not very fancy, but neat, very functional, new and/or refurbished, very clean and well kept. The Location is the best in Barcelona. It is a very short walk to la Ramble and a five minute walk to Placa de Catalunya - the major square of the city, and not more than a 5 minute walk to 2 metro stops. It is located in the Old Town, minutes from major sights and museums, shopping, and restaurants. It is very quiet. It is located on a pedestrian street. Our room had double glazed windows. You hear very little, if any street noise. (and Barcelona has a lot of street noise.) Although small, (we had a standard room), the room was probably slightly larger than that of the average 3 star European hotel. The only negative was minimal space for clothes: a small closet and three shelves. However, there was enough floor space for suitcases, and we had ample space for our 6 day stay. The room had a safe and a minibar, which we used to store some juice and yougart. The twin beds were very comfortable. The bathroom was very modern, and spotless. It had a bidet. The shower was excellent. Lots of toiletries were supplied daily. The staff was very effiecient and helpful. We notified them of an early arrival, and a room was ready for us at 10:30 am. They called out airline twice for us at no extra charge. Other pluses include a security guard on duty 24 hours, elevators that worked very well - never had to wait very long, and free newspapers in the lobby. Barclona is a fabulous city with numerous fascinating sights. Our favaorite was the Park Guell - a must see. If you like gelato and waffles, we strongly recommend \"Sweet Gaufre\", a five minute walk from the hotel. It is located on la Ramble, about a block north of the Gran Teatre del Liceu, on the same side of the street. A large ice cream cone is very visible at the front end of the shop. We tried several ice cream shops/stands, and this was shop was absolutely the best. Everything is home made, from the waffle batter to the ice cream ingredients. The staff is very friendly, and on our last day they gave us free waffles. Do not use the change places to exchange money. The rate during our stay was about 1.59 US dollars for 1 euro. They charged almost 2 US dollars for 1 euro. Use ATMs or your credit card. The best way to get from the airport to the hotel , is the aerobus. It is about a 40 minute ride and the cost is about 4 euros. It drops you off at the Placa del Catalunya, about a 5 minute walk to the hotel.

They are generally 3+ or 4 star properties with modern, elegant quasi-minimalist interiors and slick bathrooms. I've stayed in a number both in Europe and Argentina, and have always found the service to be first-rate. The NH Duc de la Victoria is no exception. The building looks a little like a Florentine palazzo from the street. Its location is a great feature: in a quiet, pedestrian street between Las Ramblas and the cathedral, the hotel is within easy walking distance of the metro, buses, the downtown sights, as well as restaurants and the joys of Barcelona shopping. Rooms are comfortable though not large -- it is worth paying a little extra for a \"superior\" room -- and bathrooms have deep tubs and powerful showers. The restaurant serves reasonably-priced if unadventurous meals, although most guests will be eating out at the hundreds of restaurants in the area. Staff are multilingual, unfailingly polite and attentive. My only criticism of the hotel is the pricing of the lobby internet terminal, which after a \"free\" 15 minutes rockets up to \u20ac20/hour! In-room Wi-Fi is available on a daily tariff that is much more reasonable. If you haven't brought your lap-top and don't fancy paying through the nose for the lobby terminal, staff will direct you to a nearby \"locutorio\" where you pay \u20ac1.20/hour.

While there were several positive aspects for our stay, there was particularity one which was quite negative.. I will save this till later. The hotel does have a very nice location, as mentioned by several others. Also, I received timely responses to several e-mails concerning taxi directions, etc. The second room we had, 422 was fairly large, for Europe, and the bath excellent. We arrived at the hotel about noon on November 29. We had tickets for Aida at the Liceu Opera for that evening. I had e-mailed asking that, if possible, we be allowed in our room early so we could rest a bit prior to attending the opera. To the hotel's credit, we were given a room shortly after our arrival. We did indeed nap a bit that afternoon, and thus enjoyed the opera much more than we could have had we been dead tired from our overnight plane trip. The production was really outstanding. The problem was the room, number 420, size and layout. It was, as we saw on the posted floor plan, and later verified, only a bit more than one-half the size of other rooms. When the space taken by the twin beds is subtracted, that meant the remaining area was indeed minimal. The bath fixtures were fine, but here again the bathroom was tiny,. The door would open only about 90 degrees before hitting the toilet. I had to squeeze into the bathroom, and I am average size. I happened to see two young ladies checking out of room 422 the next morning, and immediately requested that we be changed to that room. My request was granted. I later spoke with the desk clerk, and then the manager, to inform them that I thought it ridiculous that both rooms had the same \u20ac140 rate,, that 420 should have had at least a bit less rate. Neither person seemed able to understand this. Since our final two nights were on a weekend, our rate for 422 was only \u20ac120. I am sure 420 was the same rate. So don't stay in 420, 320, or any other 20 if you want a decent size room for a decent price. Another minor irritation was that we were not allowed to purchase a morning cup of coffee in the dining room. We could buy coffee, but only if it were to be delivered to the hotel lobby. The Bagel Shop, turn left out the door, then left again at the street, is great for breakfast, but not open Sundays. It is across from the park in the middle of the block.

Clearly the advantage is that there is no Spanish traffic to cope with (often not so tame) and it\u2019s a quiet street too \u2013 I\u2019ll deal with the disadvantage later.

Breakfast (which was served until 12h) is a grand buffet, with all the standard foods, but you can order eggs/ sausages to be freshly done the way you want them for free. My only slightly negative point goes back to arriving at the hotel. It is in a pedestrianised area, and you can\u2019t reach it by car, meaning that once you find a parking place (difficult in such a busy area of Barcelona) you have to walk 5 min with your luggage to the hotel.

Like other reviewers, we'd recommend the Bus Touristic (you may as well go for the 2 day ticket as it costs barely more than a 1-day pass). We'd also suggest avoiding weekends in Barcelona as the city is markedly busier (I assume all the Spanish sightseers are around at weekends). We saw a couple of pickpockets at work but if you are sensible with your belongings (rucksacks held to the SIDE with a covering arm and use body belts for cash) they should pose no threat at all. Highlight of our stay was the magic fountain at the Placa d'Espana. The Happy Bar&Grill on the Rambla Di Catalunya which served a mixture of Spanish and non-Spanish food and the La Perla Nera (Italian) on Via Layetana were our restuarants of choice.

One of the major finds was the Barcelona guide book supplied in each room of the hotel. We managed to eat VERY well thanks to this book and I would really recommend a glance if only to avoid all the over priced places in The Ramblas. Well worth a try is the restaurant VISIT which is in the Pulitzer hotel c/Bergara just off of Plaza Catalunya - everything about this restaurant was excellent!

Las Ramblas is literally a 2 minute walk. The parc de catalunya is again 2 minutes away where you will find loads of taxis (the taxis are very reasonable).

The air conditioning was excellent and the bathroom was clean and the free products were excellent. Also, the hotel was either very quiet or the walls very thick - we were quite near the elevators and heard nothing! The staff were very helpful and most of them spoke perfect English (the others were near perfect!). We didn't try out the restaurant but we did notice the room service was quite reasonably priced and served until midnight. Just be wary of two things in Barcelona: 1. Impuesto (?) tax. The site we booked our hotel through said 99 euros a night but then this surcharge was added as we checked out. It was only about 7 euros a night but if you aren't prepared then you could be out of pocket - especially on a long stay! 2. People begging for money. Yes you have no doubt been warned about beggars, pick pockets but I haven't heard of the experience we went through. A young man starts walking with you, asking you questions, when you tell him you aren't giving him any money he starts hurling abuse. When he did this I decided to pay further attention to him - just in case he did try to rob us. His teeth were really rotted away and it was only when he began shouting I realised this. Furthermore, he was \"working\" with another girl. I feel this is definitely a way to get people to bring out wallets/purses and then rob them, pass it to the girl and escape. When I started shouting back he left - he didn't want any negative attention. My advice is if you feel something rather dodgy is going on shout, scream - make noise - people will notice. They might not do anything but these people do not want their faces recognised so that they can pull another \"job\" later. For a great meal - there is a restaurant on Mont Juic that looks out on to the whole of Barcelona - it even has a revolving floor. Outside it says Restaurant - nothing more, but it is absolutely wonderful. Montjuic el xalet - Tel. [--] to book.

The woman that checked us in wasn't exactly all smiles, but she wasn't what I would describe as rude either. The hotel is, as other members have mentioned, in an excellent location for traversing the city, but it is also right next to some busy shopping streets, and is joined to other residential/business properties, so don't expect to be in a quiet area if you book this hotel. On the Friday night that we were here, I heard a party going on through the walls (but this city has a busy nightlife so you can't really come here and then complain about noise!). Apart from that, the location is perfect for shopping and eating. There are many restaurants, bars and shops that you will come across if you simply wander around the narrow streets near the hotel, or on La Rambla. However, as with many cities, the busy areas can also be the dirtier parts to the city. The streets in this area are a bit grubbier than the historic parts of the city, so don't be surprised if you see rubbish, dog poo or men weeing in allyways! If you want a more luxury area, you may want to try another part of the city. The Gaudi sights such as Park Guell, Casa Mila and the Sagrada Familia are not within walking distance, but we took a tube to Park Guell which was only a few stops away, and managed to see the other two sights on the way back in the same morning, so nothing is too far away. The tube service offers the equivalent of a London tube one-day travelcard for zone 1, which covers all major sites(and it's cheaper than London). We enjoyed the area near the Picasso museum most of all. The area has cobbled streets and is very well kept. The food we ate in a cafe called 'Origen' served great local cuisine, but many other places looked equally nice. This area was also easy to get to from the hotel.

The hotel has an excellent central location in a quiet pedestrian street just off Las Ramblas, where we were dropped by our taxi, which resulted in a short walk to the hotel. It is possible to drive to the hotel entrance but not many drivers are willing to do so. On arrival, the staff were not particularly welcoming but were efficient and helpful whenever we had a query. We had requested a room on the 4th or 5th floors but despite this were allocated rooms on the 2nd floor. On inspection, all of our rooms were suitable being adequately sized and overlooked the street. They were clean, had laminate flooring and twin beds pushed together and included a safe, mini-bar, sliding door wardrobes and a good shower over the bath. The rooms were always well cleaned each day. The main downside of the hotel is the lack of a lounge area (there were some sofas in reception) and bar. On our first morning we had breakfast in the hotel, which was disappointing and not worth the 12.5 Euros price. The dining area was bright, clean and spacious and there was a reasonable selection of cereals, bread, pastries, fruit juice; cheese, yoghurts but the scrambled egg and bacon were cold. On the following mornings we walked up to Placa Catalunya (5 minutes walk) and had breakfast in the Beer and Coffee Caf\u00e9 (next to Cort del Ingles), which is much more welcoming and costs far less. Our recommendations for restaurants include La Fonda in Carrer dels Escudellers, which does not open until 2030 and frequently has long queues, as it is so popular. Fortunately it seats 240 on 3 floors and so the wait is usually short and worth it as the food is good and modestly priced. Another favourite was Trobador at the top of Carrer de Ferran, which is much smaller than La Fonda, a little more expensive but has great food and an excellent atmosphere. We ate here on 2 evenings as on our last night we were booked into the Attic on Las Ramblas but on arrival they had no knowledge of our reservation, despite it being made personally the day before and written down by reception. Despite the Trobador being full, they still managed to fit us in with a short wait, which gave us time to have an aperitif. The staff are very helpful and the service was always excellent. Another recommendation is a small intimate restaurant named Sedna along from Monument a Colom on Passeig de Colom, which we came across by accident on our way back to Las Ramblas from the Port area on a lunchtime. We had the 9 Euro menu of the day, which was very good with excellent paella.

He pointed in the direction of the hotel and we wandered around for at least 15 minutes (with our bags) before stumbling upon the hotel. Later that day we helped a couple who had had the same thing happen. Not the hotel's fault ... but I'm not sure how anyone could preclude this happening to them. The hotel is located on a short narrow street without a lot of foot traffic -- we were a little uncomfortable with being out late at night. I wouldn't recommend this hotel for a woman traveling alone just because of the isolated alley that it's located on. Otherwise, the location was excellent -- close to all of the action but quiet because it wasn't right on the main drags.

After two remarks (each morning) to the desk it got fixed. It's true that they are just doing their job, but for me that's ok. The location can't hardly be beaten. Right in the centre off where you want to be: close to sights & shopping. And all this in a quite sidestreet! A real plus. We loved on day one: The Ramblas and the fish-restaurants of Barcelonetta. On day two: the guided tour to Barri Gotic and the shopping line (notably shopping centre L'Illa Diagonal). On day three: the Bus Turistic (we stopped at Segrada Familia, Parc Guell, FC Barcelona)and a part of La Routa Modernista on foot (with a visit to La Padrera, with fine audio tour).

We took the airport shuttle to a drop off point near the hotel, but carrying 7 suitcases, we looked desperately for a cab to take us the rest of the way, even if it were for just a few blocks. This was my first experience in Europe at which time I quickly realized our culture in the U.S. is completely different. We heard 3 responses to our plea for a cab, one telling us the hotel was in the opposite direction it actually was in, another telling us it was \"that way\" giving ambiguous directions and two more cabbies who said vehicles were not allowed on the street and that we needed to walk. After about an hour of total frustration, exhausted from the 11 hr flight, jet lag, and toting our heavy luggage around in heat and humidity we weren't used to, I sat on our luggage in the plaza and almost started to cry while my son took directions from people and walked around in circles only to return to me shaking his head. Each person we talked to pointed in a different direction to our hotel. Finally, I found one lovely woman who drew me a map with street names and arrows. We followed the map and found we were actually only 5 min. away the entire time, but the Gothic Quarter is a maze of narrow cobblestone alleyways that don't seem to go in any logical pattern. When we finally collapsed into the hotel lobby, I told the desk clerk how difficult it had been for us to find it and how happy we were to finally arrive. She asked for my booking info and proceeded to, very efficiently, book me into our room. No comments whatsoever about my dilemma. Very professional, that was all and no help getting the luggage to our room. This was the way we were treated by all staff there. The hotel was lovely, the breakfast buffet was one of the best I've ever had, but the staff were cold and distant. I realize this is their culture and that Spaniards aren\u2019t the \"Hey, how ya doin'?\" type; no, \"Have a nice day,\" here. In fact, that was the way it was all over Europe. Very to the point, very professional, but if you were to drop dead, they'd sweep you aside to make space for the next person. I found this attitude, along with being ripped off by high-priced merchants, (10.00 Euro for a glass of ice tea, 17.50 for a cappuccino which included a \"sitting fee\", 154.00 for a water taxi to the airport in Venice) and cabbies enough to end my fascination with Europe. As far as the hotel, though, if I were ever to go back to Barcelona, which I really did find fascinating and the women beautiful, I would definitely stay at this hotel. The room safe wasn't working when we arrived and they repaired it within a few hours. We needed to store our luggage after checkout and before the ship arrived and there was absolutely no question that they would keep it in their safe. They treated us very well, the hotel room was beautiful and fabulously clean. The buffet was amazing. I will pass on their name and recommend them to anyone. Just beware, you can get very lost if you don't know your way around. Also note: taxi's are allowed onto the streets to deliver you to your hotel, I just think there isn't enough money in it for them because it's a short distance. Also note that if you're from the states, the hotel staff are going to seem unfriendly to the point of rudeness, but I think that is just their way. That attitude continued all throughout Europe.

The only negatives: Internet access wasn't free (we brought our laptop, but for wireless access, you had to pay 6 euros an hour or 12 euros for a day), and then there was the twin beds theme that seems to prevail in Spain: instead of a full or queen or king sized bed, we got two twins pushed together. Since they were on rollers or something, they moved around quite a bit, so we ended up sleeping just on one of the twin beds. If they could fix this situation, this hotel would be near-perfect.

Children aged 4-12 charged 10 Euros & 13 Euros respectively, under 4 are free. Once bought, you can get on & off the bus as many times as you like within the day, or two days.

You can buy tickets at the respective bus stops and although there may be lots of people queuing, its very well organised and the buses are very frequent. Its great to walk up & down Les Rambles - lots of human statues, artists, bird sellers, flower stalls, restaurants. Better still, visit the Attic restaurant for dinner (120 Les Rambles). Arrive early 6.45pm - 7.15pm and have a window seat overlooking Les Rambles and watch the world go by. If you prefer eating later would advise booking. Food is very good & extremely well presented, although don't expect it to be piled up on your plate. Cost approx 16 Euros per person for a main meal & dessert.

Also cab driver insisted he could not drive on the street here (This was not true.) and dropped us off a few blocks away. Location is excelllent however for walking and being near the Gothic Qtr. and Ramblas. For the price I would NOT stay again just because of front desk.", "Date": "July 10, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Palermo", "Title": "\u201cBest Hotel in Barcelona\u201d", "Author": "enzo_bisconti", "ReviewID": "UR3639355", "Content": "I was in Barcelona with my wife from 25 to 29 june and we have had a big surprise living in the Hotel NH Duc de la Victoria.

We wanted to have a couple of days in Barcelona to do the open deck bus tours and the Ramblas. With the help of the Aquamarina Hotel reception staff, we booked the NH Duc de la Victoria. It took us about an hour by train to get to Barcelona, Placa de Catalunya station. Unlike the person that was ripped off by one taxi driver, we went for a taxi because it was raining but the guy in the taxi gave us directions and said just to walk it, it would only take 5 minutes. He was right, so they're not all bad guys. The Hotel and staff were first class, the location could not be better. On our second day, although checked out, the staff kept our luggage until approx 20.00hrs when we were organising to go back to Santa Susanna. Again, because we knew our way about a bit (almost natives by now) we walked to the train station in approx 5 minutes. NH Duc de la Victoria...Brilliant. Barcelona...Fantastic.

After we checked in, my girlfriend and I noticed that we had 2 single beds, so she checked with the clerk and we were upgraded (along with a wink from the clerk) to the top floor, with a balcony with views of the Cathedral and Montjuic. Definately great service! I agree with another reviewer about the taxis taking advantage of tourists. We were a bit tired getting into Barcelona and did not realize how close the hotel was to Placa Catalyuna, so we grabbed a taxi that took us for a 10 euro circular ride and then dropped us off and pointed out how to walk to the hotel! Unless you have a lot of luggage, it's very easy to get around Barcelona by walking and taking the metro. I also recommend \"Set De Born\" for great Catalan & Castillan tapas (try the combination meat and cheese plates!), and Origins...both of these are in the Born and about a 15 walk from the hotel.

The room was a bit small for 3 - but manageable. We paid 114EU and went to the previously mentioned bagel shop for breakfast which was just what we wanted (try their fresh fruit salad with yogurt and honey!). Staff was fine with good English - but we did not interact with them that much. Took the bus from the airport which worked out really well. Also used the subway - very easy. Recommend Egipte (Las Ramblas, 79) for a tapas lunch close by (but don't eat at the italian place next to it) and Xampanayet in La Ribera. Barcelona is great!

The hotel was everything we were looking for. It is absolutely central, meaning you can drop shopping bags/get a change of clothing/get some suncream/have a nap inbetween your activities in Barcelona. This was wonderful for us. Being so central also means you can get there rather easily: Take the airport bus stopping directly in front of the terminals (3,6\u20ac per person) to the Placa de Catalunya. You can't miss the place: it's HUGE and likely most other passengers will also depart there. The bus drops you in front of a big department store (Corte Ingles). Turn right and head into the pedestrian street Portal de l'Angel. After 300m the street narrows down a bit and you turn right into the Av. Canuda. After 50m the Av. Duc de la Victoria (and your hotel) is dirctly to your left. Total walking time: 3-5 min. Our room was furbished in a very modern and elegant way and was sqeaky clean, the bed was comfortable (if a bit soft for my taste), and the room was very quite during the night. All technical facilities (TV, safe, minibar, shower etc.) were in perfect working order. We booked the breakfast and found it to be excellent. From the complete cooked english stuff (bacon, eggs, fried tomatos, mushrooms, sausages etc.) over cheeses, sausages, fresh fruits, various cereals to a wide variety of local cakes there was everything to get you started in the day (and to slow you down again if you didn't stop eating in time). We did skip lunch because the breakfast was so rich. Talking of eating: If you don't mind walking a few steps before dinner, I'd like to recommed the El Mussol (Aragon, corner with Passeig de Gracia). They have a menu in English/German/Italian, excellent food, and *very* nice and helpful staff.

It is really worth the extra charge. - my twin bedroom was large and had a tea/coffee making facility, which wasn't the case for the other bedroom we were using . A problem could occur in the bathroom, which wasn't too small but where you literally had to climb over the toilet to access the bath : can be quite akward for anyone disabled or overweighted . - the reception staff was very helpfull and the booked all the restaurants for us (it is quite difficult to find a table in a good restaurant even one day ahead during week-ends) We really loved this hotel, which is worth much more than 3 stars . A few tips about Barcelona : - one must be aware that the Gaudi buildings are very expensive to visit : more than 15 euros for the Casa Batllo, 8 euros for the Sagrada Familia where there is actually nothing to see because the inside is totally covered with scaffoldings... - we soon realised that most taxi drivers were actually going very long ways round with us .

The rooms are lovely, wood interior, with a television (only English channel is CNN), a lovely little bathroom and a wonderful power shower. The cleaners naturally clean your room everyday and leave you some sweets at the end. The staff at the front desk were very very very helpful, spoke English (and if they didn't they bloddy tried hard) and when we had to check out, they were more than pleased to hold onto our bags till later in the evening.
