The hotel even had an aperitif hour ( champagne, red and white wine on the house)...My only negative comment was about the toiletries.

Based on the reviews, I opted for this hotel and it turned out to be the perfect choice! It's located in a lovely little cobbled street just a few yards from the Spanish Steps, Via da Condotti (designer street) and Metro station. Upon arrival the staff couldn't have been more helpful. There was six in our party so we had two doubles and one twin room all located in the main hotel building. One of the doubles was a little small but still very nice. The decor was excellent and the room was perfectly clean. The view from our windows was just the back of other buildings but that was the area it was in and you couldn't expect anything else unless you had one of the very few rooms that overlooked the cobbled street in front. The hotel has a lovely reception area with luxurious chairs to sit and read papers or tourist material they had in a folder. There was also a computer with internet on that you were free to use. Every 2nd evening they would have a table,in reception, with refreshments for you as you were on your way out or on your way in to the hotel. There was champagne style white wine, red wine, orange juice and various nibbles, all served by a member of staff. It made a very relaxing start to your night to have a few glasses of wine and a lovely chat to staff that were always interested to know what you had done that day and where you were off to that night. If I had any critisim at all it would be breakfast. This was served between 7.30am - 10.15am and was of a continental sytle.You had a choice of meats, cheese, salad, cold chopped omelete, croisants, pastries, cereal, tinned fruit, yoghurt, fruit juices and tea/coffee. This sounds great but the hot water for tea was from a flask so obviously not hot enough to make tea with and the food didn't seem to get refilled throughout the breakfast time, once it was gone, it was gone. It also wasn't all ready out for 7.30. So we found that if you wanted a full choice of everything, the best time to go down to breakfast was between 8am - 9am. There was only one member of staffon breakfast duty who wasn't very friendly. A special mention for the cleaning staff who were lovely and friendly and did a supberb job. Also when I had my purse stolen in Rome the staff immediately gave me their phone to phone my bank back in the UK and didn't charge it to our room and let us use it as long as we needed. Even with the slight critisim of breakfast I still give this hotel 5 stars and would highly recommended it to anyone for any occasion. We fully intend to go back to Rome and to this hotel. I've already recommended it to several friends.", "Date": "April 13, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Saginaw, Michigan", "Title": "\u201cExpensive hotel for the quality, room, and breakfast\u201d", "Author": "twoods13", "ReviewID": "UR127378190", "Content": "I expected the rooms to be small however linens were not great quality, room was clean, breakfast is terrible quality for the price 10 euros equal to a Days INN- I am meaning can fruit contail, back of hotel overlooks back yards, kitchens of restaurants, and kids toys in the yard, and car service to airport when leaving was a joke, our driver appeared to have slept in his suit with stains on his clothes, seat of car, cost was 60 euros; however,hotel location is perfect!

The only time we took transportation was for arrival and departure; otherwise, we walked everywhere. We were in Rome for 3 nights and had booked a standard room in the annex. In the photos other travelers had posted on Trip Advisor, these rooms looked more spacious and had good light . We were given a room in the building on Via delle Carrozze, and it was awful. The walls, baseboards, & door frames are in great need of repair; the only window is a small one on a door looking out to a stairwell & another building. The room felt dirty, and there was a spider in the bed. The only good thing was the bathroom. I immediately went back to the lobby and asked to be changed. Unfortunately, they were not able to change us that night but said they could for the remaining 2 nights. It was hard to believe that both buildings are part of the same hotel. The annex on Via della Croce is clean & updated; you notice the difference the minute you walk in the building. The only negatives to this annex are: 1) We were on the street side, and it's on a noisy, lively street (cafes below). They have good windows that block out most of the noise, and it was fun to look down on the action below. 2) a new shower head is desperately needed. The front desk staff was nice, and it was very helpful to have the computer in the lobby. We did not have their breakfast, as we prefer to find a local place for coffee & breakfast pastries. It's usually a much better breakfast, you get to mingle with the locals on their way to work, and it costs much less. We went to a good place on Via della Croce - corner of Via Bocca di Leone or Via Belsiana, same side of Via della Croce as the annex.

The room was small, but immaculately clean with a brand new bathroom and wonderful air conditioning, which was a complete necessity at this time of year. There was a small restaurant at lower ground level which served an adequate breakfast of cereal, pastries, cold meats an omlettes along with juices and freshly made coffee and cappucino. The staff were probably the most helpful people in Rome and could advise in all tourist matters. Now the best bit.... LOCATION.... This hotel is right in the heart of old Rome. Just a few feet away from the Spanish Steps, a five minute walk from the Trevi Fountain, ten from the Pantheonand slightly further afield the Vatican and Colloseum at about 25 minutes walk. We did not have to use public transport once. To sum up, the rooms are small but quaintand full of character. The location is a fantastic base for seeing all of Rome.

We arrived before the normal check in time but the staff was helpful and after only a minimal wait they had our room ready and the porter helped us with our luggage. After reading other reviews I was expecting to be placed in the annex and we were (there was no information on the reservations stating that we were not in the main building). This is both good and bad. The annex was like having our own private apartment in Rome, we didn't have to walk through a hotel lobby and the door lead right into the street across from a decent little restaurant. The downside is that breakfast is served in the main hotel around the corner so it is not easy to just run downstairs and grab something to eat and the rooms are smaller in the annex I think (the hotel\u2019s website do not show how small the rooms are). The room and bathroom were both tiny but similar to most hotel rooms in Italy. It was clean and well maintained. The shower was notably tiny though a little over 2 feet square. The breakfast was ok but not really worth the extra money, there are plenty of little cafes that are available for breakfast around. The rooms also had free WiFi access that was good enough for Skype. The TV is very small but has a few English channels. Also as a note to travelers the room does not have an iron or ironing board due to the fire hazard. During the stay we used the coffee pot and cups and they were never replaced through the three nights we stayed. Also the walls are paper thin. Not normally a problem because most tourists are quiet and go to sleep at decent times. Unfortunately we had two teenage girls staying next to us that came in at around one in the morning and proceeded to talk on their phones and to each other loudly for over an hour and would not get the hint when we knocked on their door and the wall. The walls are also so thin we could hear one of the girls talking quietly with her boyfriend and later even hear their phone vibrating. I never noticed any noise from the streets during the entire stay. Overall a decent hotel with friendly and helpful staff. The location is great; near a metro, the Spanish Steps and the shopping district. But for the price I would have hoped for a better breakfast, accommodations and knowledge of where the room was going to be located.

Breakfast was fine with fresh cappucino and a variety of bakery, cereals and meat&cheese. I would definitely recommend the hotel to young groups and couples who are in for sightseeing or shopping.

I regret that we didn't say anything because I'm sure they would have tried to correct it, but it just wasn't that big of an issue for us. But the room is not the best part of the Condotti, it is the location. You are just a short walk from the Spanish Steps, a metro stop, and many shops and restaurants. We walked to every site we went to in Rome, the Vatican (the longest walk at 35 minutes), the Borghese, the Pantheon, the Trevi Fountain, the Colosseum, and other destinations. It is true that there is no parking at the hotel, but you won't need a car because everything is so accessible. The staff was also very helpful and friendly. Angelo, was particularly helpful and recommended the best restaurant we ate at during our week in Italy (il Margutta, just a few blocks from the hotel). Everyone was kind from the cleaning staff to the front desk. The hotel will gladly take your bags if you show up early from a red-eye flight before your room is ready.

According to the fire plan the other rooms were more spacious. However small, the room was kept very clean; even towels were changed every day (which is a unnecessary, really). No noice from the streets could be heard inside the apart hotel room which was great for sleeping - only the beds, at least in our room, were rock hard so it took a bit of getting used to, also walls are very thin so you could hear everything from the neighbouring rooms. Breakfast was not included as we were in the so-called apartment hotel -although without any facilities for self-catering- but it was very good value for the eur10 cost.

Please note that there are no facilities to boil your own water in the room! Breakfast is part of the deal, served at the basement in a rather cramp space. The menu are the same everyday. Since, we stayed there for 7 days, we wish to have more varieties. The best part of this hotel is the location. If you are into shopping, nothing beats this location. Just a few meters away from the hotel is the famous Via Condotti where you will find your Gucci, LV, Prada, Burberry, Jimmy Choo, etc., etc. If you are not into high end and branded stuffs, there are still many, many shops and boutiques around the hotel. There's also a supermarket and a pharmacy nearby if you need to get any stuff. The hotel does not have F&B outlets but that is not a problem because there are many restaurants around the hotel. The italian restaurant just next to the hotel serve authentic italian dishes with very reasonable price. We had dinner 4 times at the same restaurant and very happy with the food and prices. As for tourist attractions, Spanish Steps is just 3 minutes away by walking. Other attractions such as Pantheon, Trevi Fountains, and many others are also very much within walking distance. As for the rate, since we stayed for 7 nights, we got one night free of charge. Also, the hotel provide one-way airport transfer (airport to hotel) free of charge if you stay longer. The driver was very promt and he waited for us at 6.30am at the arrival hall. We were driven in a Mercedes to the hotel. We asked the hotel to arrange for our airport transfer (from hotel to airport) which cost us 60euro. We were driven to the airport with a Jaguar!!! Not bad at all since if you take the normal cab, it will still cost you at least Euro45 to go to the airport but you may be driven in a very compact car which cannot fit your big luggages.

Our room overlooked the back of the hotel into other hotels and apartments airconditioning equipment and yards. The negatives were:- The hotel's management decision to paint and redecorate the stairwells during peak season made it a bit difficult to walk up or down the stairs around paint cans and tradesmen. Not normally a big issue but it was here because the small 3 person elevator didn't work for a day and we normally would use the stairs as we were only on the 2nd floor. We had no hot water for a day. I believe the communication to guests could have been better, regarding the renovations and the hot water issue.

One is the Palace and one is the Hotel. Although located near each other, they are vastly different. The hotel is nice, the Palace is not. The first red flag was when I recieved a stingy confirmation from the Hotel for my booking in February that stated that since I received a good price for my stay, that it would not include breakfast. I was paying around 85 Euro for off season. So, I promtly cancelled my reservation sensing that I already didn't like the way they greedily conducted business. It's not like European breakfasts are austere and usually consist of a croissant and coffee so I couldn't figure out what the big deal was. However, I booked the hotel again a few days later to see if I would get the same response since it clearly stated on the website from which I booked that breakfast was included at this rate (venere.com). I know the breakfast thing sounds kind of trivial, but it can be expensive to eat out in Rome and having the convenience of eating and getting out early is nice when on vacation. I did not get the no breakfast response so I kept the reservation. I arrived late in the evening around 10:30. They informed me I was not staying at the Hotel but rather their annex which is called Condotti Palace (not Condotti Hotel) instead of the Hotel. I was very tired and wanted to get to my room asap We left the hotel and walked outside around the corner to the Palace annex, The person who helped us with our bags then commenced a 5 minute conversation with a restaurant owner in the street on our way to their \"annex\", which is really another B&B called Condotti Palace. This may not sound like a big deal, but we were clearly very tired and had all our luggage and had to just stand there in the street while he chatted. away to his friend. I had tointerrupt and ask the luggage man to please get us to our room, it was almost 11:00 p.m. by this time. The room has gross blue carpet and was very dark. The breakfast was not served in the room that you see on the website but rather in a narrow hallway leading to the room. We didn't eat breakfast there. There was a bunch of cracker like snacks on the dresser in the room but no signs as to whether they were complimentary or to purchase. No price list. We didn't touch them, but when we checked out they inquired if we ate anything from the cracker stas. The only nice thing I have to say about the hotel is that it is close to the subway which is not necessary since Rome's sites are all within walking distance. I have read of others who had this bait and switch happen to them too and were sorely disappointed by their scheme. I stayed at the Santiquttro B&B near the Colloseum and had a much better experience. I guess if I had stayed at the actual Condotti hotel, it may have been a nicer experience, but I can't trust them now. It was also obvious the front desk buy doens't really like Americans too.

We're very surprised at reading some of the recent reviews of the property in that we actually found it to be quite lovely, and the staff (especially Cezary) attentive and eager to lend assistance. The staff's command of the English language was just fine and considerably better than our feeble attempt at conversing in Italian, and every attempt was made by the staff to address any concerns or requests we made of them. After all, we were in THEIR country and frankly the world should not be required to be fluent in English just because we speak it at home -- we weren't at HOME! We definitely made every attempt not to come across as the \"Ugly Americans\" and perhaps our positive experience was a result of not trying to be heavy handed or insistent upon having all things as they are back home. Our room on the 3rd floor was lovely and the air conditioning was fine (in fact, sometimes it bordered on v-e-r-y cool but the guest can control the air conditioning). While it took some getting used to squeezing our American girths into the very small shower stall, we simply viewed it as one more difference between life in the U.S. and that in Italy to be embraced and enjoyed. After all, we traveled to Rome to experience something different, not life as we know it back home! The exterior and lobby areas of the hotel are absolutely charming (the hotel is located on a picturesque cobblestone side street right off the Via Condotti), and if you're in luck, Arthur and Nike (2 very well behaved miniature Schnauzers who I believe are pets of the owner) will greet you at the door. While an elevator is at your disposal when transporting your luggage to your room, you will need to walk up a short flight of stairs to reach it. A bellperson is available to assist in bringing your luggage to your room if needed. The breakfast bar is located in the basement of the hotel and serves a nice assortment of cheeses, salami, croissants, breads, cereals, fruit, yogurt, coffee and juice. A lovely little lady is in constant but discreet attendance and oftentimes will be softly singing, which added to the experience. While some may find the menu somewhat limited, again -- YOU'RE IN ROME and that is how the Romans do breakfast. And if you look carefully at the people you will see in Rome, the locals are quite discernable from the tourists in that the Romans are almost all svelte and in wonderful physical condition (light breakfasts and all that walking, I'm sure), while the tourists (ourselves included) looked positively gigantic -- a very HUMBLING experience, I can assure you, and one that inspires non-Romans to hit the gym at their earliest opportunity! Please do not let any recent negative reviews sour you or dissuade you from staying at the Hotel Condotti.

Guests had to wait in the lobby one floor up and keep going downstairs to check for a free table. Breakfast offerings were minimal. Cereal, bread, fruit, yogurt capuccino and tea etc. Nothing hot was offered. Although rooms are supposed to be non smoking there were ashtrays right beside the non smoking sign on the table and the bell boy said to ignore the sign if I wanted to smoke. (I smoked outside).

Location is excellent - near the Spanish Steps and great shopping and dining. It's on a side street with little car traffic. The staff was extremely friendly and helpful. The rooms are quite small (typical of many European hotels) with barely enough room for anything but the bed and a bureau. Has a tiny elevator big enough only for one person with a bag. Nice breakfast in a basement breakfast room. We paid only about 180 Euros per night, breakfast included. There are probably many other hotels in Rome that are as good at this price. No reason not to stay here, but shopping around may provide a better deal elsewhere.", "Date": "April 14, 2003"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "4.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Tacoma, WA", "Title": "\u201cGreat Value\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR906796", "Content": "The hotel is very clean, with a friendly staff and great location - very close to the Pantheon.", "Date": "March 2, 2003"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Condotti Hotel", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g187791-d203181-Reviews-Condotti_Hotel-Rome_Lazio.html", "Price": "$113 - $1,317*", "Address": "<address><span rel=\"v:address\"><span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">Via Mario de' Fiori 37</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:postal-code\">00187</span> <span property=\"v:locality\">Rome</span></span>, <span class=\"country-name\" property=\"v:country-name\">Italy</span> </span></span></address>", "HotelID": "203181", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/01/e3/e2/31/lobby.jpg"}}
