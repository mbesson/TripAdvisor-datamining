Handed over to Grand Pacific 4 months ago by Le Meridien.I can't recall a Hotel anywhere where there were so many eager young staff members in the lobby at all times ready to help you with anything at all, always with poise, politeness and a smile. Check in/ out and concierge were very good. The latter even sent a new Kabuki brochure under my door as soon as she got details about show times !Grand and very spacious....public areas and the room too. Was upgraded twice to a luxury room having booked a terrific rate I caught on Travelzoo. The decor is very classic....lots of cut crystal sconces, chandelier in the room (!). The door separating a roomy foyer/ makeup table closet and bathroom from the rest of the room gives extra sound insulation ...not that that mattered. Very roomy bath with separate shower, lots of counter space and a Toto washlet toilet seat! Tons of bathroom amenities, I still haven't figured some of them out ! Comfy beds and pillow, good blackout drapes. The hot water dispenser in the room was nice for making coffee and tea.Free Internet in the business center but no wireless (found virtually no wireless in Tokyo to my surprise).The Monorail to Odaiba Island is about $3 US per person/ trip but the Hotel runs a shuttle ever hour on the 1/2 hour starting at 930AM to the sister hotel in Shingawa, The Grand Pacific, where you can catch the rail line that makes a big loop around Tokyo. It seems anywhere you stay in Tokyo you have to commute to sightsee since things are spread out. I found Hotel restaurant's breakfast and menu very pricey but we did have the buffet one night at Le Bouquet but the quantity/ quality was excellent for the $39 per person (no extra tax/tip).There's a 24 hour convenience store just outside the hotel and plenty of mall type restaurants at Aqua City or Venus Fort.Note the last Airport Limousine bus from Narita to Odaiba is around 630 PM. We got in later than that so you wind up taking the bus to Shingawa at $28 each and then hoping a cab for another $35.

The hotel is beautifully decorated. The Concierge desk is very helpful but some of the staff do not know a lot of English they still try and help though, or they find someone who can help you.The only bad thing I can say about this hotel is that the mattresses are extremely hard, I did read this in other reviews but thought how bad can it be, believe me they are extremely hard. Apart from that the hotel provided us with interconnecting rooms, as we travelled as a family of 4, my advice is to confirm that this is what you want about a week before you travel, they are very prompt at answering emails.Some of the restaurants have very small portion sizes, you get a much larger amount of food at a much cheaper price in the underground mall opposite the hotel. This hotel does have a bus to disneyland/sea but book it early, probably even before you get there! as it books up very fast. Disneyland/sea is all in japanese the only thing in English is the guide/map. The airport bus does come to this hotel but book that as soon as you arrive as well.", "Date": "Jun 15, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR594410986", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "austrip"}, {"Content": "Great Refuge from Tokyo Bustle       the Aqua City Mall nearby", "Date": "Apr 13, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR743127742", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "giulieta"}, {"Content": "Simple Elegance I really enjoyed the Grand Pacific.

My husband and I stayed at the beautiful hotel for 3 nights. The room more than met our needs. Larger than normal hotel rooms. I cannot say enough good about them. The view was fantastic. Our only real problem was the front desk. As we did not have any Yen I tried to convert Aussie dollars to yen but they would not accept them only US or Euro. The bank hours did not open till 9am so we could not get cash out from our credit card either or use our credit card at the exchange counter. As we had an early morning tour we had to go the whole day without any cash. Only when we got back to our hotel in the evening would they accept my credit card to give us cash. The staff were very friendly and the room was made up as soon as we left it.

That said, the rooms were nice and comfortable - an important thing for me is the beds having Duvets - which were very nice and comfortable.The bathroom again was clean and nice - one thing the Meridien does very well is the range of things in the bathroom - you really neednt take anything. There was a headband, cotton wool, moisturiser, toner, shampoo, conditioner, body wash, cotton buds, bath salts, toothbrush, toothpaste ....even pjamas ..you could have just turned up and it was all there.The toilets in Japan are just a hoot ..and its great to have one in the privacy of your own room as you can fiddle about with it and get to know it which you cant really do in the public version. There is a nice heated seat, a water spray at two diferent angles, a flushing noise and a nice little air jet ...if you are a westerner, expect to be very suprised by your first experience!Room service at the hotel was very good and I would reccomend the hotel in general. For me, I needed to be in and out of the city quitefrequently - and the hotel is definately too far away for that - it took me 40 minutes to get to places like Roppongi and Harajuku from there and cost between 3,000 and 5,000 yen each way. It's much more spacious and airy than the rest of Yokyo but lacks the vibrancy of the city.
