I had used Trip Advisor to identify this hotel as a top romantic hotel, and was not disappointed. The most impressive part of our stay were the employees. The British receptionist was extremely helpful and attentive to our needs, assisting with dinner reservations, water taxi reservations, and help with sightseeing. Dindo, the night receptionist, morning chef, and much more, was very warm and engaging .... we always looked forward to interacting with him. Nani, the housekeeper, always had out room impeccable following a day of sightseeing. Room 106 was large and comfortable, and the bathroom relatively large by European standards. The bed and pillows could have been a bit softer, but this is an issue of personal taste. The hotel is conveniently located to many places of interest, particularly the Accademia and Guggheim museums. The little morning breakfast room is light and airy, has a flat screen TV for watching a bit of news, and Dindo puts out a delicious spread each and every monining. The hotel is also very secure, as everyone who enters must ring a little doorbell, and be admitted by the receptionist.

Instead ill just list a few: *Lorna - the perfect hostess - this hotel would not be the same without her. Nothing is too much trouble and she goes out of her way, consistently, with every guest. *We stayed in the Cassanova room - beautiful and romantic. Good size for Venice and the most gorgeous double shower with lots of hot water!!! *Location is perfect - 2 min walk to the water taxiis and we walk everywhere in Venice. Nothing more than a 15min walk away. And Lorna maps it all out for you, very easy to follow. *My now finance actually booked this hotel as he proposed to me in the middle of San Marco square on sunset, He had arranged for a bottle of champagne to be in our room when we return from dinner. And there is was on ice waiting for us when we got back, *My final words.... the most quiet hotel room i have EVER stayed in. I was a flight attendant for 10 years and have stayed in my fair share of hotels around the world but this room bets them all..... i literally couldn't hear anyone the entire time i was in the room, not even in the hallway!

The location is great, not too far from a taxi stop and in easy walking distance with your luggage. We easily walked to all the sights of Venice from our hotel. It was in a less congested area of Venice and that made it nice and quiet, which my husband and I really enjoyed. We also found a local murano jeweler (husband and wife team) right down the street from the hotel and you can find some wonderful pieces of jewelry in there!

So convenient and such a welcoming sight in what can be a very confusing city. The front desk woman (man, I feel bad that I forgot her name, but I remember she was British) was super welcoming. She pulled out a map and gave a lot of great recommendations for restaurants and sights to see in the neighborhood. She highlighted all these great spots and we went to 2 of the restaurants she recommended and they were both excellent (Da Fiore and a beccafico). This is when we realized how convenient our hotel was. After this, she asked me to walk around for about an hour and return to the room so she could bring some prosecco on ice for us. It was our honeymoon and this was such a great touch. The room was small, but clean and comfortable. Service, as stated, was very good. We had some coffee in the morning and a pastry as well.
