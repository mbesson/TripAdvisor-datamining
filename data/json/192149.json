We had problems with the location of a previous hotel at south ealing and decided that residing at a hotel nearer to the city centre would be better. However, this decision would cost us painfully in time to come. Let me begin with what's good about the hotel. The owner's hospitality and the location. Located a short 3-4 mins walk away from Russell Tube Station, which itself is on the piccadilly line, the location of the hotel was really good. Costa's Coffee, a cheap and reasonably good chinese restaurant and the supermarket are all just a couple of mins walk away. If u're up for it, the walk to King's Cross (with a map of course) isn't too bad either. Now... for the reasons why I wouldn't recommend the place to a friend traveling there. The bed bug infestation. The reviews about the bed bug infestation on this place is pretty accurate. By the end of the second night my sis and I were covered with bite bugs. My sis and I had just arrived from the Scandinavian states and we have been traveling for approximately 3 weeks prior to our arrival in London so his claim that the bed bugs were brought in by us wasn't accurate at all. The mites and bugs weren't hidden and I killed a couple myself on my skin at night. By the end of the 4th night, and a room change, we realized that the bugs were not only on the bed but on the carpeted floor as well as our clothes which we had just purchased had a couple on them too. The lack of internet access and proper breakfast added to negative impression. But having already shifted hotel once, we decided to just put up with the hotel till the end of our trip. I'd recommend not staying at this hotel during ur stay in London. There are a couple of other hotels along this same stretch of road (Goodwood Hotel etc...) which I strongly suggest u check out before committing to this hotel at all.", "Date": "June 19, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Sleep Quality": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Amsterdam, The Netherlands", "Title": "\u201cbed bugs\u201d", "Author": "Hooft", "ReviewID": "UR63141697", "Content": "Ok, the location is fine.

We were all treated for the critter infestation and it eventually subsided. We contacted the hotel to alert them of our troubles. After having faxed them all of our medical bills and prescription receipts, they refunded all of our money for our stay and reimbursed us for our medical expenses. They were very apologetic and explained that sometimes people check into the hotel after staying in hostels and drop off the bugs in their beds during their stay. Even though they were cooperative about refunding and reimbursments, we will never stay there again.

Would have left if i could have afforded to. The hotel was recently renovated they said. The brochure talked about \"chinese antiques\" The room was terrible and the beds were awful. Was not pleased with the accommodations at all....and no one really cared. Went back again to london in Sept. 2002 and stayed at the Jury's great russell street hotel.

We didn't use breakfast, so nothing to say about that...The main thing that was really bad: the showers..In the hotel were 3 showers: the first one gave only cold water, the second one changed every second from too hot, till ok, till too cold and the waterpressure was really, really low... after a few minutes the shower didn't want to shower anymore.. The third shower was \"the best\":the temperature was just warm enough and the waterpressure was good enough to get al the soap out of your hair, after ten minutes...

I just spent a week there and I am totally not satisfied. The location is quite good, and it is true that it's close to the tube station, but it is not at all \"above average\" as stated on this page ********. A friend of mine recommended me to go there because he went there a couple of years ago, and it was a quite good budget place. But I guess the management changed a year and a half ago. There's totally no maintenance, and the place looks really creepy. Only the hall looks quite decent, but as soon as you go up or downstairs, everything's different. The carpets are very old, smelly, visibly dusty and even ragged, especially on the stair steps. The elevator was out of order, so not only I had to drag my heavy bags, but I bet there would be no access to disabled people at all. And no need to say that it is not true that the rooms are cleaned on a daily basis. On the first night I was given a creepy room, very dusty, with dirty bed sheets, broken window (could not close it), and no fridge as I paid for. (There were phones inside the rooms, for outgoing calls only, but they were not working, as the main phone of the hotel was not working as well. In fact for three days in a row before my departure I had been trying to give them a call but no one ever answered the phone, and then I learnt why.) I asked for more clean sheets, and the incompetent german receptionist led me to the store room, and told me to pick the ones that \"looked\" clean to me. And some weren't, with visible stains on them. And of course they were not ironed, but not even clean. I asked for another room, and he told me there was no other room available. All he could do was get the fridge the next day from another room. I slept with my clothes and coat on, not to have any contact with the filthy bed linen, and did not unpack my bags, as I wanted to run away and ask for a refund. The morning later, there was a quite nicer lady at the desk, who told me that the german guy should have given me another room, even if it was a double one. We agreed that I could decide to stay if I had a clean room. She told me there were two, on the fourth floor, the highest. I picked one. The following day -it had been raining- in the evening when I got back to my room I realised that it was raining inside as well, and specifically on the bedside table, where there were all the switches for the room lights, so I was worried a short circuit could occur. All they did was give me a cloth, and promise they would have repaired the roof in the morning. Last but not least, one night I could not sleep because there were noises in my room, in particular a plastic bag seemed to be touched or moved my something, and I found out that it was some rat trying to pull a biscuit out of it (which meant the rat was under the bed!!!). That was the end of my \"happy\" budget holiday. The morning later, the same lady at the desk told me that she thought the mice might come from another room that probably has never been cleaned for two months, and in which a very messy and dirty guy who used to work there had been living. The only reason why I did not check-out as soon as possible is because they told me that what I paid through credit card (?44, the 35% of the weekly rate) did not count for them as it all goes to the site, and so they had to charge me 2 nights from the ?80 I paid there in cash. Which meant I would have lost ?60 with no reason. I really hope they're going to do something about it.", "Date": "March 21, 2004"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Service": "1", "Rooms": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "berlin", "Title": "\u201cStay Away of this Cheaters' Hotel!\u201d", "Author": "lylou", "ReviewID": "UR1620744", "Content": "We booked there through the Internet.

It is one of those things, that if you cleaned, you would have seen immidiately. Because we are not suckers, we did not agree to pay extra price (as he wanted), since he gave us 3 bed bedroom instead of 2-bed one.
