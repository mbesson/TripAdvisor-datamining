I have a very sensative nose and I did not smell anything except some kind of room deordorizer which my wife and I both liked. The price was great for what we paid!

The first problem with the hotel is they said we could check in at noon after standing in front of the counter while the employees talked to their friends on the desk phone for five minutes. When calling back at noon they said what they meant to say was one. We came back at one and waited another fifteen minutes for the same employees to stop conversating between each other, one being the operations manager. When finally getting into the room the smell was terrible and there were more problems. The shower curtain was missing, the screen to the window was broken so the window would not open, and the lamp above the table was broken and hanging upside down. Since we were in a hurry we called down to make sure we would not be charged for the damage. We showered then looked a little more into the room. Pulling back the blanket to the bed pubic hair was found covering the bed. That was enough so we called back down and asked for a refund. The lady said yes so we booked another room next door. When turning in the keys they then informed us the shower was used so there would be no refund. Nasty, disgusting, and unprofessional.

Problems: 1) In other studio 6's, you can park your car next to door of room to unpack/repack your car. Here you must enter with all your stuff thru the lobby and down the hall to room. Lots of work when you have a cooler/dog etc. 2) The rooms smell. Not their fault, mostly from Katrina flooding. Smells strongly of must/mildew, or cigarette smoke (even nonsmoking rooms)....and I tried a bunch of rooms. The smell was so bad I didn't want to touch anything, everything seems dirty although it looked OK. They even have nice new granite counter tops. 3) Lots of large groups of construction crews stay here, not very conducive to a wholesome,homey feel. 4) I have a dog, I sympathize with how difficult it must be to keep things smelling good, but I swore the hallways smelled like dog duty. 5) I was traveling with my dog and the areas to allow her to go to the bathroom in were awful, so full of dog poop you couldn't walk into them. And the smell, forget about it! I realize some people don't pick up after their pets but the staff should make an attempt to clean the grounds up every once in a while. The staff were all very friendly and helpful. I feel bad for their situation, with the flooding and all what can they do. I would recommend ripping out all the carpeting! I ended up leaving early and renting a condo in the city, immaculately clean and odor free.
