The first night we were assigned room no. 2, the room was far below average but worst of all we were bitten by bedbugs. In the morning a girl from Spain which acts as cook and cleaning staff took also the receptionist role and switched us to room no. 3. Room 3 greeted us with a worn down carpet and hole in the floor where you could step into broken wood and a couple of rusty nails, the bathroom was so tiny I could not shower without hitting the shower valve and inevitably changing from freezing to scalding water, also the faucet was outside of the tiny bathroom. We thought we had left the bedbugs behind but on the third night we found many lying around on one of the beds. Again staff was unavailable apart from the cook/cleaner/part-time receptionist who, of course, in spite of her best efforts could not offer us a valid solution. We had paid for a fourth night but decided to leave and paid about half the rate for a far cleaner and better room on the Easy Hotel just accross the street. In summary: paid for 4 nights, stayed 3, slept just one night. The manager a guy that goes by the name of Raphael took two weeks to answer his mobile, offered me a refund for the fourth night but I still haven't got it. Believe me, the only good thing about this hotel is the location and I am certain this is the only thing that keeps it alive, but within a 2-block range from the Alexander Hotel there are about 10 more hotels and at least 3 of them with comparable rates.

It was a trip I had organized for my boyfriends birthday as we had not been away for over 2 years due to financial problems, we chose London as we had never been before. What was supposed to be a romantic break turned into the trip from hell and this hotel is totally responsible for this. On the outside the place looks great however your heart will sink the moment you set foot inside. Peeling wall paper, dirty carpets and very dingy and dated.....it gets worse. We were checked in by a rude and sultry receptionist who didn't show us to our room, didn't tell us breakfast times or check out time. It took several attempts to get into the room as the lock was faulty, not safe or reliable as it was hanging off. Once inside I wanted to cry (and actually did). We were greeted by the most disgusting smell that can only be compared to a sewer. There was black mold everywhere, more peeling wall paper, a window that would not shut properly, dirty bathroom (pubic hair on a glass) a horrible view of the tiny back yard which was also filthy and the carpet was wet constantly. I immediately complained and asked to be moved rooms however I was told we could not as they were full. We would have checked out there and then if it wasn't for the fact that we had already paid \u00a370.00 deposit and they therefore had our credit card details and would charge us the other \u00a370.00 for loss of room revenue if we walked out. We got no sleep what so ever during our trip, the walls are paper thin and we could hear next doors activities and snoring. Being on the ground floor with a dodgy door lock and a window that wouldn't close left us feeling incredibly unsafe and anxious. Breakfast was awful, cold toast, coffee like tar, no milk, microwave scrambled eggs and green bacon that was part raw. Service terrible This gave us food poisoning. Needless to say we skipped breakfast the next morning and just checked out. That was after an embarrassing incident where the housekeeper let herself in when we were getting dressed despite us shouting very clearly that we were still in the room! We complained again on check out and were told the manager would contact us, he did not. After sending daily emails and placing daily phone calls I have still not heard anything from the manager. They have given me his mobile number which he ignores and doesn't answer the messages me and my mother have left him. This hotel is by far the most disgusting place ever and should be condemned.

I normally check things out with Tripadvisor first but we were pushed for time so I took a chance and made a booking then felt very worried when I read the reviews. So what was our experience? Well, on the positive side, it is very close to Victoria Station thus making London very accessible. We did not have any problem with the booking - we were late arriving but the nice woman on reception buzzed us in and was very polite and competent. The staff are mostly young European women and they were all helpful and charming. We were a bit early for breakfast but the young lady let us into the dining room and promptly took our order. The brekafast is not going to win awards but we had cereal followed by toast and scrambled egg along with a cup of tea. All perfectly adequate. On the downside, the rooms are small and although we had quite a nice tv in our room, the tiny one in our daughter's single room did not work. That said, we were out all day so that was not really an issue for us. The showers are ok but hot water is still hit and miss. The rooms are cleanish but they certainly are not particularly modern. My daughter thought her room was a joke when we opened the door to be faced with a doorless hanging wardrobe to the side and 2 white fire doors in front of us. In fact, the tiny single room was hidden behind these very springy doors. Hmm. Not sure that would impress anyone! Overall, they seem to have improved on the meet and greet front and the rooms are ok if you just want somewhere to dump your stuff and go off round London.

Based on my research, hotels in London can be pretty expensive, so when I found a decent deal on the Alexander Hotel, I took it. We stayed there for two days, and the location was decent, but the accomodations were nothing to write home about. The room we stayed in was tiny with pretty much just enough room for the bed and a small table. The bed itself was comfortable. The bathroom was very small and the shower was a problem. The shower had warm water but sprayed in a strange pattern, and no matter what you do, the floor becomes thoroughly soaked. I believe I read this in another trip advisor review and thought that wouldn't be a big deal, but an inch of water covering the floor in cold London is really uncomfortable. If you take a shower in the evening, the water is waiting for you in the morning. God help you if you are wearing socks. We had a first floor room, but there is no elevator which may make it difficult for guests who have difficulty lifting their luggage. The breakfast was unremarkable but also unoffensive. I do have to say that the location was pretty nice. It was only a 5 minute walk from Victoria Station, and we actually rolled our luggage from the station to the hotel. We were also not far from the meeting point of our tour to Stonehenge.

Breakfast was very average- but it did the job. I believe that this is a low-cost B&B- so the other occupants tended to be young travellers like us. The best thing about the small dining area was that you basically had to share space with the other travellers- which turned out to be a good thing- why travel if you don't intend on meeting people from other walks of life?

If you go--make sure you stay on the 1st or 2nd (which in america would be called the 2nd and 3rd) floors.", "Date": "October 6, 2004"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "4.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "santa barbara, ca", "Title": "\u201cGood place to stay\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR2185906", "Content": "Despite reading some mixed reviews we decided to stay last minute when a friend came back from a trip to London to say she had left another hotel on the same road (Holiday Inn) and moved to the Alexander hotel for a better price. Staff were helpful (the girl on reception found an indian restaurant on the internet for us) and the room was clean and bright, a bit tight around the edges but the shower in the bathroom had a fabulous extra large head which was just great! Price is right (65 pounds) and the place is close enough to the station to walk (which saved a cab fare). Bad points: breakfast is only to 9\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 we arrived just before 10 on our first day (but they gave us toast and coffee still). The weather was in a heatwave so without air conditioning we had to leave the window wide open all night but it wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t too bad. There was no hairdryer but again the receptionist gave us one to keep in the room when we asked. Summary: excellent website (our room WAS as shown on the site) with directions and information, genuine staff, location in a good spot, a few bits here and there but nothing major and nothing you wouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t expect in this price range anyway.

It is certainly what one would call a budget hotel, and travelers should expect to get what they pay for, as it is a relatively cheap option for London. The carpet may not have been exceptionally clean, but everything else was wonderful. We stayed on the first floor (second floor in the U.S.) and although our room was very small, it was comfortable and even had a balcony! It was very nice to sit out there in the evenings. Our room got street noise during the night, especially with the windows open for ventilation, but it was not a problem. I'm not sure if they have air conditioning in the hotter summer months; should check. We very much enjoyed the English breakfasts, finding the eggs not at all hard. There was a good selection of food. One of the best parts was the en suite bathroom, which is a rarity in London B&Bs in this price range. Ours was great except without a shower curtain. All in all, a very good option for someone on a budget and very acceptable. Also in an excellent location for sights and Victoria Station.

Not only our room doesn't look far from what is represented on their website -- it was almost a time warp experience! My girlfriend couldn't stop laughing when I had a photo made with me pointing at their '70's looking but not hip curtains and carpets. There is nothing chic nor tasteful about our tiny room #2. Either you requested not to stay at the ground floor or just go for their twin bedrooms. Ours was very disappointing, it was dark and the furniture is very old.

The staff, especially the wait staff, are very friendly and helpful. The free breakfast was good: eggs, bacon, toast, cereal, fruit, etc. The location is good, 5 minute walk from Victoria Station and other tourist sites, such as Westminster Abbey, were about a 15 minute walk. Best bar around was The Elusive Camel. The location was quiet and the bed was comfortable. Negatives: My room did not have a heater or radiator when I arrived, fortunately when I asked the front office the manager immediately grabbed a temporary radiator from his office and took it up to my room and plugged it in. The last night I stayed a radiator had been installed in my room, but it covered the cable outlet, and therefore I had no TV, and I could not get the new radiator to come on. There was a weird smell in the hallway and in my room. Opening the window during the day helped, but not quite enough. The bathroom had some mildew and the air vent was clogged with dust bunnies. Other than that, the room was clean.

The downside of the hotel is, as with most hotels in the UK, the rooms are REALLY small. If you are traveling with more than 2 people, it will be a real tight fit.
