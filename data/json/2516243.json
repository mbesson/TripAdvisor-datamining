Very nice in most respects, with one big BUT ... my room apparently used to be a smoking room and smelled terrible. Never did get used to it. Had a pretty decent looking breakfast bar that also served something up at dinner time. I had company functions so didn't try the dinner food, but I think it was lasagna one night and meatloaf the other. Couldn't sample much of the breakfast food either since I'm a vegetarian and they mixed ham into the quiche they were serving up. I'm sure most people would like it. Staff was friendly.

I needed a split suite for my family of four and we landed at this Homewood Suites. The room was clean and I well kept by the housekeeping staff. Front desk staff was very helpful. My chief complaint was noise at night. We got a room in the far west side and there is a major intersection and cars and big truck are going through all night long. I would imagine the north side of this hotel might be bad also. If you get a room here request one on the south side. I don't think the east side is an option as that is where the office is located. This would be a great spot for two types of travelers - business and shoppers. There is a major shopping mall and business district nearby and this hotel would serve them well. The pool is small and we never did use it. The work out area is also small but this Homewood Suites has a great deal with the LA Fitness across the street. For $2/day/person you have access to a very up-to-date facility. The LA Fitness has a bunch of machines and free weight and even raquettball courts. Great shooing nearby. Since we were here several days, we took advantage of the local groceries store. Access to and from the hotel was super easy with highway 51 close. We found getting around Phoenix from this spit very easy. We were about 20 to 30 minutes from everything. End on a positive - on our last day they let us extend our checkout time to 2:00 pm.

It provided the peace & quiet we needed as well as being away from other guest rooms (I'm sure they didn't want to hear our grandson crying at 4:30 am!). The hotel provided a suitable crib for us both times. Each unit has a small kitchen with a decent size refrigerator, which we needed for the baby's milk and other supplies we purchased at the nearby Trader Joes and Frys Superstore. The kitchen has the basic amenities (microwave, coffee maker, 2 burner stove, dishes, and a few pots and pans. There is also a laundry room on the first floor, which we used a few times. The washer and dryer cost was quite reasonable. The maid service was good and we didn't lack for emptied wastebaskets or clean towels. The curtains in the bedroom and living room are sun blocking, so it keeps the room darker for an extra few winks in the morning, which we appreciated after getting up so early to feed the baby. We liked this place so much we came back the following month and stayed there over Thanksgiving. It was a different room, but very similar to the other one. Staff and service personnel were friendly and courteous. An extra bonus is a very decent complimentary breakfast served daily and an evening appetizer served Monday-Friday in the downstairs dining near the front desk. I should also mention they have 24 hours coffee, hot chocolate and tea downstairs in the lobby, as well as cool drinking water, While this place has a small indoor gym and outside swimming pool, we didn't have time to use them, but it is something to look forward to in the future.

The in-suite full kitchen is a must for hotels these days IMHO, and I usually select Homewood Suites or Residence Inns for that reason. Nice light suppers provided at their \u201cWelcome Home Reception\u201d Monday through Thursday. Chicken fajitas with rice, refried beans and green salad were on the menu for Monday night. I was a bit surprised that beer and wine were not offered as at other locations I have been to in Las Vegas, Dallas, and Orlando, but I ended up eating there the rest of my Monday thru Friday stay for the convenience after working long days, even though I could have expensed meals elsewhere to my company. Menu items the rest of the week included meat loaf and mashed potatoes, marinara sauce and meatballs, and always included a salad bar. The evening suppers at Homewood are certainly several notches above the snack-type evening offerings at any Residence Inn where I\u2019ve stayed. Wonderful daily breakfasts are also a plus, with rotating menu items including bacon, scrambled eggs, sausage, biscuits and gravy, waffles, cold and hot cereal, fruits, yogurt, and a variety of beverages. I purposely chose a suite opposite the sports bar that another reviewer mentioned as being rather noisy using the online advance check-in system through the Hilton web site.

The location is great. Lots of restaurants, shopping and groceries within walking distance. The area felt safe and was relatively quiet. Only a few minutes from downtown and the airport, and easy access to most major thru ways (51, I-10, 101, 202, I-17). On my first stay they told me they only had one room left, a queen smoking. I asked to be moved at the first available opening, don't think they even tried. The coworker whom I was commuting with, who already had a room here had checked in a week earlier and they told him all they had was smoking then too. Those beds were not queen but double and the smell of smoke was almost intollerable. I had to keep my windows open constantly and even used a whole bottle of odor nutralizing spray. On my next stay (4 days between stays) I was given a king non-smoking, MUCH BETTER. [I do have to say that the suite with 2 dbls was more spacious than the king] I really enjoyed the evening receptions 4 days a week. However they would only put out a few things at a time and it would run out quickly and they were not being replaced quickly enough. The food area did not have good flow and would quickly get cluttered with people. The access to the Business center was difficult as people would \"camp-out\" on the computers for long periods of time. Wireless in the rooms was pretty hit and miss too. Overall I would stay here again.", "Date": "April 8, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Arizona", "Title": "\u201cComfortable and Clean Perfectly Located\u201d", "Author": "SpicynShellie", "ReviewID": "UR25116609", "Content": "I had a corporate extended stay at this hotel and it was delightful. Nice sized suite with a very comfortable bed, plentiful pillows, and comfy duvet cover. 2 plasma screen TV's with one in the bedroom and one on the living area. Fully equipped kitchen with full size refrigerator, 2 burner stove top, microwave oven, dishwasher, and coffee pot. Dishes, flatware, and cookware included. Daily breakfast offering as well as an Evening Welcome Home light meal that was substantial enough for dinner. To save on your food budget, go to Trader Joe's and Fry's across the street in the shopping center. If you don't have a car with you, there is a complimentary shuttle that will take you within 5 miles of the hotel. Adam, one of the drivers was delightful and concerned that I called him to get a ride back to the hotel. Front Desk check in was not very informative but I quickly found my way on my own, thanks to Tripadvisor. As is my usual complaint, the coffee was dreadful and did not even give an ounce of a caffeine kick. I recommend bringing your own coffee or doubling up on the packets in the room and brewing your own. Housekeeping was super efficient and they run the dishwasher for you even if you just have a fork in it. Not very green thinking on their part but they cared to make sure the suite was just perfect every day. My room was quiet and comfortable and the neighborhood is excellent. Plenty of towels and Neutrogena amenities for the bath that are replenished every day.

The room itself was adequate, if nothing special. It was on the first floor, but not noisy, nor did it give the impression of being unsafe. Within walking distance are a Trader Joes, a Fry's supermarket, a Mervyn's and a host of other stores (so I can only surmise that when the other reviewer said that it is not pedestrian friendly that he or she would be unable to walk two blocks). The next morning, the hotel's shuttle took me to the rental car place a half mile or so down the street (Tip: when in Phoenix, never, NEVER rent a car at the airport, the fees are insane. Instead, book your rental at one of the Hertz or Enterprise locations in town, then return your car to the airport; you don't pay the airport taxes that way. Even better, if you can swing it, cab both ways to your hotel, and rent just while in town ... if you are there for any length of time, you will definitely save your cab fare, and will have less hassle than waiting for the stupid rental car shuttle at Sky Harbor).
