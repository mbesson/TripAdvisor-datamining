Yes this is a stunning hotel in a stunning location but the service we've experienced here has not been great. Lots of staff but problems at the bar and at breakfast where the service is slow and disorganised. Standards of housekeeping have also been rather hit and miss. Prior to our arrival we stayed at the Boca Beach Club (also Waldorf Astoria) and the two places are like chalk and cheese. Here at the Casa Marina the staff appear inadequately trained and poorly supervised. Overall the hotel has a feel of absentee management with largely well meaning kids seemingly running the show. Whilst in Florida we've also stayed at three Westin hotels. I have to say that we had far more engaging service at the Westins. That's a shame because the Casa Marina was to be the highlight of our holiday (and certainly the most expensive). We are coming to the end of our stay in the US and we've enjoyed every minute of it. We've had a fantastic time and we've met so many truly hospitable and wonderful people. I've been genuinely overwhelmed.

They really should consider closing a least part of the resort and doing a re-build or makeover. The common grounds are quite nice (though strangely the resort lacks an actual real restaurant!), but again, some of the older rooms are so bad as to make it an unpleasant experience. Also, while we always feel ripped off by \"daily resort fees\", it is especially grating when you really do get nothing for it. Casa Marina charges $25/day resort fee. For that, we got one poolside popsicle, one cold towel poolside, and terrible internet service. The wireless was slow, and the 2 computers provided in the lobby were woefully outdated and not up-to-date with software. It took me 10 minutes to print out a boarding pass!

This continues all around the resort even after you come inside. The grounds are all well maintained and are just as beautiful as in the pictures you'll see on the site. The building really fits in well with the scenery and from the outside is very well maintained and beautiful. Once inside, the lobby is an open inviting space. It gets pretty crowded and the lines for check-in tend to back up. Similar to most people our room was not ready upon arrival. We ended up using our welcome drinks and snack, given to us by Hiltton HHonors Gold status, but I would have rather gotten into our room and made our way down to enjoy the beverage on our own time. Luckily it was just over under an hour and a half wait. Arriving at check-in time this is a very poor welcome, especially as a Gold member, but would be annoying for anyone. The rooms are pretty nice for what they are. We were in an Ocean Vista King room and the view was very nice. On the first night it was actually really nice to be able to sit on the balcony and just listen to the ocean. It's also a great view to wake up to in the morning. The rooms are not too large, but are comfortable for the few hours a day you aren't sleeping there. The bed is comfortable and the shower has good pressure and plenty of hot water. In our room there was a small sitting area both inside and out on the balcony. These were great to enjoy a quick snack or eat lunch at. The room seems to be well insulated. The only noise we heard came from the connecting door or through the balcony door, when very loud things were going on. Overall though it was a very quiet stay and we were able to sleep well. The rooms seem worn in many places. The bed is clearly getting a bit worn out and might improve from a replacement soon. Chromed fixtures are chipping. There were a couple holes in the drapes, easily visible early in the morning. The shower has some dark spots in the caulk. The room was clean and kept clean during our stay very well. But, over time things get worn out and it's clear that's happening here. Most people we interacted with during our stay were very friendly and really tried to make our stay a pleasant one. The beach and pool attendants were fun and were always quick with towels, drinks or a chair. The bartenders were attentive and gave us a few good laughs. The waitresses at the restaurant were quick and provided good service at breakfast. The valet and bellmen were friendly and quick with our bags. The only place I felt like I was being hurried out and not really appreciated as much was a couple interactions at the front desk. Activities at the resort are really nice. There is the beach to lay out on. You can't just walk out into the ocean, so don't expect that. The beach also isn't typical sand and is a bit rocky. But it's big enough for everyone and the attendants help make it a great afternoon. Next door is Barefoot Billy's where we had an excellent jet ski tour. For a morning workout there is also an excellent fitness center. It's definitely one of the best centers I've seen in quite a while. It's clean, has plenty of high quality equipment and bottled water and towels to help you out. Overall it was a very pleasant, relaxing stay. I've definitely had a better overall experience for less, but the grounds and activities around the resort are included in the cost and add a lot of value.

From the front of the hotel it is a short walk to an excellent restaurant/bar called Louie's Backyard with different menus upstairs and down, and a relatively short walk to Duvall Street and many of Key West's attractions and restaurants. The view out back is dramatic and beautiful. When one exits the central lobby, one sees a wide strait path with reflecting pools along the sides and beach, palm trees, and ocean beyond. There are swimming pools on either side and a restaurant in between. There are hammocks and lounge chairs on the beach and plenty of lounge chairs and umbrellas around the pool. The very helpful pool conceirges will arrange towels in chairs and your umbrella for you. If you stay by the pool long enough, you may be surprised by a Jolly Rancher popsickle or a frozen Eucalyptus towel to cool you off. The concierges inside are also quite helpful and busy. The hotel itself is quite attractive, and an elegant but comfortable mix of the traditional and the modern. The room my friend and I shared (a traditional with garden view) was simple and spacious but very nice. The only complaint about it was that the bathroom was quite small and did not have adequate towel racks, and there was only one drawer in the bedroom furniture. Although the service was a bit slow, the waitstaff were very friendly and helpful. Food in the outdoor restaurant and that served in the breakfast buffet ranged from good to excellent. I was on the bed and breakfast plan, and did wish the hotel had self-serve coffee available before I was actually seated for breakfast. There is a boutique which serves Starbucks coffee, but I did not want to pay extra for this or deal with it first thing in the morning. The waitstaff was good about getting me a \"to-go\" cup of coffee when I asked, but it took a long time, they were very busy, and I hated to ask the next morning. My friend and I each had a massage and thought the massage therapists did an excellent job. We were a bit disappointed that there was no waiting room for the \"spa\", a converted room suite, and that there was only one chair outside the door into it. Only one of us could sit while we waited for our appointment. The \"spa\" itself was very small and had no showers, steam-shower or sauna--facilities one usually expects in a spa.

The beach, while small (they all are on Key West, I'm told) gets the vibe right with hammocks swaying underneath the palms, complimentary chaises, outdoor spa tables under thatched roof huts, and beach games such as ladder ball and sand volleyball on the lawn area behind the beach. The weather when we were there was 80 degrees and sunny...wonderful! Many activities can be enjoyed from the hotel: water excursions as well as the trolley tour. The gym is good, location of hotel is good - on the south side of the island near the southernmost point. Now, the negatives...the execution. We have stayed at other Waldorf Astoria properties and this one does not achieve the level of service that brand brings to mind. When we checked in, we were given a room that, while facing the ocean, also fronted the street (noisy!). The 2nd room we were given was more \"pool front\" than oceanfront, yet no incentives or price breaks were offered. We were told, \"this is the only room we have available - take it or leave it.\" Disappointing. The food was mediocre and overpriced and the service was slow and not excellent. \"Toes in the Sand,\" a beachfront dining experience, is a great idea with a great setup, but again, poor execution (overcooked steak, rubbery shrimp, although the desserts were very good). We expected much better for the price. There is a thin paperback publication in the room on the history of the Casa Marina. It was informative, but full of typographical errors. And if I want to keep it, it's $10. Really? I'll pass. The coffeemaker in our room was so loud, my husband had to go out for coffee so he wouldn't wake me. Overall, we were pleased with the weather, the design and layout of the room and the convenience of the hotel (3 miles from the airport). but it was not in line with the excellence we have come to expect from Waldorf hotels.

My overall rating for this property is 3.5 out of 5. Please read entire review to understand why this property fell short of 4.5/5... The \"Great\": The service of the staff-- the gentlemen at the pool were amazing!! Every day they had a spot for us reserved (at the pool or the beach) with toys for my twin 2 year olds along with champagne for the adults. Cold towels, popsicles, water, free samples of the drink of the day, etc. We never asked for any of the items provided, which made this experience that much better!! These guys never disappointed and we made sure that we took care of them as well. Shontel (Blonde hair server from Rhode Island) was amazing with our family and took care of anything we needed. She was very attentive in regards to making sure that all our requests for drinks/food were taken care of in a timely manner. She made our family feel like we were at home... Thank you!! Cathie at the Concierge desk-- she took care of us with arranging a wonderful sunset cruise on the Schooner Western Union. She also gave us coupons to great restaurants which we saved a bit of $$$ (the other concierges did not). That was a very pleasant surprise... The Resort-- beautiful in every aspect with the \"best\" beach available in all of Key West (which is only for resort guest). Very family friendly and plenty of space which made our family feel like we were not crowded (the hotel was at full capacity). The \"Good\": The food and drink were good, however, a bit pricy... but that's what you get at a resort, so plan accordingly. Housekeeping was good for the most part, but we did have to call a few times to make sure our room was cleaned by the appropriate time as we needed naps for our 2 year old twins by mid-afternoon. The bellmen were good as well, however, with a full hotel, you would think that you would have more folks on staff to help with the guests.. The \"Bad\": I am a very experienced traveler (67 countries and counting)... The number one item I am most concerned about is \"safety\" for my family and I. We had an incident on our first evening at the resort that needed the attention of the Key West Police Department. Needless to say, everyone is ok, but we almost had an \"missing persons\" experience. My major concern is when asking the management staff multiple times to provide updates regarding the investigation on the issue at hand, not one individual updated us during our stay (and we stayed for 7 days). I even tried to contact the managing director (Kevin Speidel) of the Casa Marina multiple times with no response (even though he mentioned to other individuals at the resort that he came to our room and left us a voicemail-- no voicemail was left as I checked every day for a message). As an executive of a Fortune \"50\" company and Hilton Honors member (Diamond, Platinum, Gold, and Silver status over the years), I expect much better of the Waldorf Astoria and the Hilton Hotels Brand Name. There are multiple reasons why I have let my status with the Hilton Hotels lapse over the last 24 months, but this tops the list. If my experience is any indication of how this property is managed going forward, then I am quite concerned for future guests. With the above said, I am rating the \"service\" category as 1 out of 5. In my mind, management needs to be accountable for it's actions... and the above example clearly defines that action they chose to take. So this is why I have rated this property a \"3.5\" out of 5.

As HHonors Diamond members we were not upgraded upon check-in and had to speak with a manager to even get a room with a balcony. Rooms are small with good amenities, although our room was not serviced one day during our stay so we asked for clean towels which were delivered immediately. The breakfast is extremely expensive ($26 for buffet) and we had to wait at least 5-10 minutes to be seated even though there were empty tables. Rent bikes and take a 2 minute bike ride to the Southernmost Cafe or Camille's for a reasonably priced and delicious breakfast. A quick walk or bike ride to El Siboney for lunch or dinner is a MUST! The guys who service the Pool and beach are phenomenal; from misting and cleaning your sunglasses, to cool eucalyptus towels; Jake, Jason, Julian, and Mark are the most attentive pool staff we've ever experienced. Surprisingly we saw very few people tip these guys and made sure to compensate for that by giving them a little extra. The pool bar staff also works very hard and we received great service from them as well. The BIGGEST problem we had, however, was the screaming children at the pools. As a mother myself I am always aware of other guests at a hotel and make sure my child is repsectful while having a good time. Most of the kids were well-behaved and having a great time but without exception there was always 2 -3 kids screaming (not yelling or talking loud, but screaming) everyday at the pools while the parents (and in most cases au-pairs) lounged about and ignored them.

The service at the front desk by Patrick was very pleasant and he was extremely helpful during our 7 night stay. The room, we stayed in a Flagler Ocean Vista and it was adequate but truly not what you would expect from a Waldorf Astoria luxury collection. The sheets were horrible, but I am a linen snob. My husband and I are very well travelled and have stayed at many luxury resorts, Pebble Beach, Sea Island, The American Club and several Ritz Carlton's throughout the world, in relation to these properties as well as other Hilton properties, in particular, the Hilton Los Cabos, the property nor the rooms are up to par with the aforementioned properties. That being said, the resort was very acceptable and probably the nicest that Key West has to offer. The pool and beach service was far above the other places that I have stayed. Steven, Graham and Jason were especially helpful, cordial and very fun. There was never a worry of not having a perfect place to enjoy the sun. We did not have issues like other posts regarding the housekeeping, they were always prompt and the room was maintained very well throughout our stay. I do agree that the service at the outdoor restaurant was lacking, it seems as if they need to change or add additional staff. We were seated at a table near the bar, the waiter walked by us several times in a 15-20 minute timeframe and kept stating that he would be right back, we didn't wait and ended up going to the bar. The service is much better at the bar but they have their hands full as the 2 people are also making all of the drinks for people at the bar, restaurant, the pool and the beach so I can see why service would be slow and the servers have to cross the walkway to pick up drinks from the bar and take them to the other restaurant seating area. It would seem that something that simple could be resolved. We would most certainly return to the resort and we enjoyed our stay greatly but it would be nice if the resort was truly up to par with other 5 star resorts.", "Date": "February 27, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Bloomington, Indiana", "Title": "\u201cloved this place!\u201d", "Author": "jordy96", "ReviewID": "UR125287499", "Content": "This is the best hotel that we have ever stayed at.

We never wanted to go outside the hotel because the beach, pool, staff, and food were outstanding. The Casa Marina offers great activities right from the hotel which really made my family have fun while getting closer together. The hotel also allows you to rent bikes and kayaks for a couple hours or a whole day. One of my favorite parts of the trip was our family's snorkeling trip (booked through the hotel). For two hours we got to experience the beauties of Key West through this hotel. Our room had a gorgeous view of the water, which most of the rooms do. Although we couldn't see a sunset, the colors in the sky were still phenomenal. We also had a great view of the public beach... which was not as pretty. Also parked right outside the gates of the hotel were a couple of men living in their trucks. That scared some of the younger kids with us. That prevented my family from going to a restaurant nearby, but you learn how to deal. Luckily there is no need to ever go to a different beach. The Casa Marina offers a small but beautiful beach. It was so relaxing. The hotel and staff really went out of their way to make everyone\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s stay more enjoyable, and my family definitely felt like that! There were many good things and some bad parts of our trip to Key West, but staying at the Casa Marina was by far my family\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s best decision. The hotel really made our vacation better, especially having younger children with us. I would highly recommend this hotel to anyone thinking about going.", "Date": "February 9, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Mount Zion, Illinois", "Title": "\u201cOutstanding location, impeccable service\u201d", "Author": "rpodeschi", "ReviewID": "UR124339778", "Content": "My wife and I traveled to Key West for the first time in November, 2011.

The room was always kept in clean order as you would expect. The best part about the resort was the service beach side. Mark and his crew of cabana boys would not let you lift a finger to arrange your lounge chair. They would often come by with drink samples, Popsicles, cold washclothes, and other fun surprises. These guys worked hard to make sure you didn't have to do anything but soak up the sun. There was plenty of sunscreen available if you left yours in the room or ran out. The food at the beach side restaurant was great as well (mahi mahi dip and fish tacos were great). One morning, they had our chairs reserved with our names, some fresh fruit and granola bars along with an arrangement of smaller conch shells. It was true relaxation. There is plenty to do around the resort as well. We reserved a sunset cruise from their dock that was spectacular. There are also games like volleyball, \"bags\", and such on the beach. A ping pong table or some other games would be nice to add in the future to get you out of the lounge chair a little.

That is the good news. The other good news is that the staff is excellent - particularly the pool/beach staff. The management, on the other hand, is shockingly bad. We reserved through Fine Hotel and Resorts, an American Express platinum card 'extra' and have never been treated so badly. Although our room was fine with an excellent ocean view on the top floor - we felt that we were sharing a room with the adjoining room as the door between the two rooms must not have had any sound proofing - or the noise came from the terrace. In any event, when we asked to have a change of rooms the next day we were offered a much worse room on a lower floor with no bath and an obvious down-grade. We choose to stay where we were when we were told nothing else was available (tho the hotel was not full as it was during the week) and the management never had the decency to check back with us to see if the situation improved (we wound up blasting the fan to drown out noise). We were also encouraged to pay for parking which was totally unnecessary as there were plenty of spots around the hotel. Breakfast was plentiful but staff insufficient and had to endure long waits for a table which seemed unnecessary as there were plenty of tables and they just seemed to make everyone wait as they were short staffed instead of letting people sit down and explain that it might be a bit of a wait - although most of the breakfast people were using the buffet, so it really didn't seem to make sense. They also had a grass cutting machine using smelly fuel being used alongside the breakfast area - again - obviously a sign of poor management.

The building is impressive to drive up to. It's not a gleaming 5* but a really high quality beach front property that is a teeny bit shabby cheek but working hard to keep it looking nice.

The first room we were given smelt of smoke so we requested to move. This was handled efficiently and we were happy with the second room. The second room we liked but the safe was locked. We contacted the front desk who sent up security. Sadly someone had left some cash in there but they were very professional about how they handled this. The whole thing was dealt with well and we were happy enough. The room we had (Flaggler Ocean View) was lovely. 3rd (top) floor in the main building. We overlooked the pool and seating area, and yes, had a small ocean view. It was lovely. Windows do not open though. There are two bottles of water a day which are free and a nightly turn down service with chocolates. A nice touch. Bathroom smellies were quite nice too. We had drinks on the terrace which was lovely. Service was poor though and we ended up getting them ourselves from the bar. All these little things stop you from totally loving the place despite what a gorgeous building it is. It's so nice that we noticed it was even included on sight seeing tours. Finally, we booked a Sunset Cruise which rather perfectly departed from the Casa Marinas own dock. How convenient is that.

But the service at the beach and pool were annoyingly slow! It took over an hour the one day to receive the Mediterranean salad. But the service at the actual sun sun bar was impeccable! We did the jet ski tour, captain Matt did an amazing job, we also went snorkeling, even though the weather did not cooperate, chalis did a great job! And then we did the sunset cruise, again the weather did not cooperate, the sun set somewhere behind all the clouds, but the crew on the sebago boat was great! We also got a couples massage in the tiki hut on the beach, my masseuse was apparently a smoker and was hacking during my entire massage. I get massages on a regular basis because I'm a runner..... For the cost of this massage, I expected a much better experience. Not very good at all. The room was meh. Not very clean, we had a patio with a view of the neighborhood/tennis coourts, the maid put a used bottle of body wash on the shelf, I threw it out so that I'd get a fresh one the next day, she dug it out of the trash and put it back on the shelf! Gross! I had to ask for a fresh bottle at the front desk. Our last night there, 8:00 AM flight the next morning...... We had a crazy situation in the hallway with our neighbors from 1230 until 200 in the morning. Apparently, they were both drunk out of their minds, one passed out inside the room and the other wanted to beat down the door to get in.

So much about checking in into paradise in a five star hotel. Not bad, but could have handled much, much better. Breakfast is ok, almost everything you are looking for, eggs, omelet station, cereals, etc. it makes you happy and full.

Housekeeping is slow and not so accurate, don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be surprised, if there is still hair in the shower or the floor isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t swept after you return from the pool, at least you do have fresh towels and the bed sheets are changed \u00e2\u20ac\u201c or worse the room isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t even made and you have to hunt down the manager on duty to complain and beg for someone to come along. My tip for housekeeping, reception, and service would be to have a meeting with the guys from the pool area. They are fantastic and make your stay a five star experience.

I must say that this hotel has all of the beauty and location that would rival any world-class resort. The grounds were immaculately kept, the swimming pools were sparkling and refreshing, the beach area was as good as anything you'll find in Key West. The view across the pools, the manicured lawn area, and the coconut palms elicited memories of Hawai'i. The pool/beach staff was attentive and friendly. The Bad: The service was not at all what I have come to expect from the Waldorf. We stay at the Waldorf Astoria in Orlando about once a month and have become accustomed to their incredible service and gracious hospitalilty. When we checked in, the desk attendant seemed indifferent. I am Hilton Gold and am used to just a little more courtesy at check in. One evening, we called down for room service around 10 p.m.. The person who answered the phone seemed annoyed that we called and, after I ordered, she told me \"All we can do is pizza\". There is no excuse for that in a high-end resort. The maid service was equally bad. The maid would be knocking on the door at 8:00 am to clean the room. If you weren't willing to be up and out of the room by that time, they didn't return until close to 5:00. The Ugly: The rooms are definitely old and certainly nothing special. We were in the \"historic\" part of the hotel. Our room was supposed to be an \"Ocean Vista\" room but the view was right into the leaves of a cluster of palm trees. No ocean to be seen without bending. The rooms were small and the walls were paper thin. You could hear things going on three rooms down. There was no DVD player or in-room movies. There was a big, long, black hair on one of our bath towels and it just didn't have a really \"clean feeling\". The carpet in the hallways, the elevator floors, doors, walls were all dirty and hadn't been maintained. If this were a Holiday Inn, I wouldn't have thought anything about it, but once again this is supposed to be a Waldorf property. Overall, the positives (the location and outdoor facilities) outweighed the negatives for us and we will return to this hotel.

As I did my research on where to stay I was not sure if it would be best to stay on the north side where most of the shopping, restaurants and night life is located or stay on the more quiet south side. We chose the south side and the Casa Marina and it was the best option. Key west is only 2 miles wide so even though we were on the other side of the action it was a short cab ride or nice walk to get there. In fact as I toured Key West and some other hotels during our trip it was clear to me that the Casa Marina was the best hotel to stay. It has the best beach and pools in Key West and all the water activities you would want are right at the hotel. The hotel has a long rich history and has that historical charm but has been recently updated so the facilities were in great shape. I am a tough critic when it comes to cusomer service and I have to say the service from all the staff was exceptional. A special call out to Bill and Jason at the beach and pool. They were always right there to make sure we were comfortable and were always asking us what they could do for us. Cheers to the mgmt there...they hire the right folks and train their people well. We loved it and will be back for sure. Not sure I would bring young children there because the crowd is a bit older and quieter and I know my kids would have been bored.

Trust me here - we are far from picky and travel a lot, so we know issues can come up. All I am highlighting is how they handled the issue. There was an \"I don't care attitude\" from many at the front desk.

When traveling to a new destination, the challenge of selecting an appropriate property can be daunting. Often times, you have to put a little trust in past experiences and the reputation of a particular brand or concept. In the case of Casa Marina, that rule of thumb does not apply. I go to great lengths to insure that my reviews do not evolve into a ranting or venting session. However, with this particular property my level of disappointment is so great that a neutral list of pros and cons is difficult. The natural setting of the property is simply stunning. The pool/ beach area is well manicured and a perfect place to relax and catch an amazing sunset. The rooms, on the other hand are very sterile/cold; creating an institutional feeling. The furnishings are modest and pseudo-modern (Ikea like), giving off a \"cheap\" impression. The absence of carpet (ceramic tile) lends to an acoustical nightmare. Sound carries terribly from room to room and from hallway traffic. Simple telephone conversations, running water and snoring can be easily heard from adjoining rooms. Footsteps from the rooms and hallways above create a bass-sounding thump that can awaken the most sound sleepers. The wireless Internet is painfully slow, which is compounded by the poor 3G mobile service on this part of the island. Overall, there is a severe lack of attention to detail. There is no \"wow\" factor. Staff is pleasant, but not responsive. On two occasions, there was no follow through from the front desk on requests. Common areas need cleaning and general operational maintenance. Windows in corridors were so smudged that guests had begun writing their names on them. General (somewhat minor) in room housekeeping oversights were experienced daily. In an effort to be as fair as possible, I revisited the Waldorf Astoria website to gauge the appropriateness of my expectations... \"The spirit of each extraordinary experience is inspired by the history and heritage of the destination, and executed with the elegant amenities that grow the Waldorf Astoria legacy.\" This quote could not be further from the actual on-site experience with this property.

Things are done slower here and if you have that frame of mind you will have a great time. The Sunset Bar was great - Nathan and Suzanne were wonderful bartenders who handled the large crowd as well as could be expected given the busiest week of the year in Key West. Anna and Judith provided massages on the beach - which if you haven't tried it, is worth the investment. Prices are up a little from a year ago ($130 for a one hour table Swedish massage), but you will leave relaxed after zoning out listening to the palm trees sway and the ocean waves come ashore only 30 feet from your table. Greg also is on hand to help, as there are up to three table available (under tents) to get your massage. Maria at the front desk was as pleasant and helpful as usual. She is a manager there now and always seems to have things under control. I went by the front desk a few times and no one seemed to be out of sort... Pool service by a young lady who's name I forgot was a little disappointing, but a quick trip to the bar to see Nathan or Suzanne took care of things quickly.

After no help from the front desk, we managed to get the manager to agree to move us. The next room seemed fine- until we realized we couldn't really sit on the balcony as people were smoking outside all around us. We asked if there was a non-smoking area but were told there was nothing. Wrong again! First, you could absolutely her everything from the next room and from upstairs. The alls seemed so thin (if a hurricane hit I worry it would just blow away!) Next, all the furniture seemed pretty scuffed- I'm not sure when they remodeled but it is certainly time again! The bed made horrible rattling and squeaking sounds if you even moved a little on it. Neither of us got any sleep- and not for any reason other than the bed made such a horrible racket. Lastly, while I know it was the holidays, the room was never made up - after being out all day we had to call the front desk to ask for the room to be serviced! I will give a couple of pluses- their private beach and pool areas were lovely. The staff at the restaurant and bar was very gracious. And it is a relatively good location with easy access to the heart of Key West. But other that hat- I would advise staying away. I should add we love kids and the other people we met at the resort were quite nice ... But for the rates they charge the quality should be on a different level.

Secondly, there isn't much to do near the hotel so be prepared to cough up for taxi / pedicab / parking etc. (Neither of these are the hotel's fault of course). Last the bad. The room rate is very expensive and the incidental charges are eye-popping. Try $12 for a pot of coffee at breakfast, $18/day for self-parking, $16/day for WiFi for starters. Drinkable wine is 10 bucks a glass, and breakfast for a family of four will run you over a hundred - that's assuming you are prepared to wait 20 minutes for a table, as I was gleefully advised by quite the rudest greeter I've ever met.

Our room wasn't up to scratch, with broken tiles and slap-dash decor. With the sofa bed up, you can't get in and out of the main bedroom. And the toilet blocked constantly. The constant noise from weddings and conventions was a pain. New Year's night was a wash-out - the bar staff closed up and fled at 12:10. Service was appalling. Our room wasn't ready after our four hour drive and we were just told to naff off somewhere and come back in an hour. Lunch would take 30 minutes to arrive poolside.

We read many of the hotels reviews before our trip, and I would say most of the comments were right on. We've also stayed at their sister property, The Reach, and it can't hold a candle to Casa Marina, so don't get fooled into staying there....it's really like a glorified Courtyard or Hampton. Come on Hilton....isn't it time to lift that \"Waldorf\" moniker off The Reach? Really? Most of the positive comments we read gushed about the pool staff at the Casa Marina, and for the most part they didn't disappoint. \"Scuba Steve\" comes around and offers cucumber slices for your eyes, which we didn't partake in, and offers great popcicles, which we did. We did set by the pool for three hours the first day and never had one waiter offer to bring us drinks or food.....which was odd. I finally went to the restaurant and ordered a bucket of Coronas, and it took twenty minutes for them to bring it to us! They have two pools, one chlorine and one salt water. Lots of chairs around each, and we were always able to find three chairs by moving some around. They have lots of chairs and hammocks on the beach as well. The pools are refreshing....not too hot or cold. We did find it strange that they don't have any type of hot tub on the property. The maid service DOES happen at different times of the day, but it is very good and the rooms are cleaned very well and the staff does a great job. Our room was always cleaned and straightened by the time we came back in the afternoon..usually around 4:00. The maids bring bottled water each day and provide fresh espresso refills for the coffee makers. We were concerned that we would miss being on the more \"happening\" end of Duval Street, but this turned out not to be the case. We rented bicycles for the entire five day stay, and they served us well, and we rode them to breakfast and dinner each day, usually skipping lunch to snack by the pool. There are many quiet side streets in Key West and it's easy to ride to most destinations on the island and bypass heavy traffic. It seems like there are more people on bicycles in Key West than people in cars, but Truman Avenue, Duval St. and others can be busy and congested. Try to avoid those if you aren't real comfortable on a bike. We rented our bikes from A & M on nearby South Street. Their bikes aren't as nice or new as some other rental places, but they provide flashing lights for the front and rear of the bikes, and were willing to work with us on a weekly rate. There are many restaurants within a mile of the hotel, and you can easily walk or ride bikes or scooters to most of them. We went to Blue Heaven for breakfast and dinner, Santiago's Bodega, Seven Fish, Flaming Buoy Filet Co. Columbian Grace for dinner....all were great, but Columbian Grace wasn't as good as last year. We also went to Sarabeth's, Pepe's, Banana Cafe and Camille's for breakfast...and they were all great as well. Pepe's would probably be my favorite. It doesn't look like much from outside, but they've been there since 1909, so they must be doing something right. There is one thing that bugs me about Casa Marina. Anybody can access the pool and beach at the hotel....you can walk in off the street and grab a chair at the pool and have yourself a fine time. I really think they should provide guests with wristbands or some other form of identification to keep non-guests from accessing the property....for securities sake if nothing else. There are gates on the end of the resort where they rent jet skis and other water activity equipment....but sometimes they're open and sometimes they're locked and you need a key to enter. Since ours was a points stay, the \"resort fee\" of 25 bucks a day was waived for us, which is nice. I'm not sure what that fee covers, but it seems stiff to me, and we were grateful we didn't have to pay it. All in all a great, historic hotel that pretty much lives up to the hype.

The rooms are tastefully decorated and spacious - our ground floor room had a porch from which we had an unobstructed sea view. Wifi is available in the room and there were no problems connecting. The biggest plus was the resort's private serviced beach - although swimming is difficult due to a rocky and uneven sea bed the beach itself is a beautiful palm tree lined sandy strip. Breakfast was excellent. Evenings are for going out and the peaceful resort appears to go to bed early ensuring a perfect night's sleep. If you are in the mood to party I would suggest nearby Duval Street (too far to walk but an ideal bicycle or short cab ride away) where you will find plenty of bars.

That means that you can't take your dog with you to sit on the beach, have a meal outside, or even walk around at the beach or pool area.

Even worse, I had been in frequent email contact with Caroline [--], concierge at Casa Marina, about bringing my dog. She had assured me the resort was dog friendly. She sent me a list of dog friendly restaurants, which included SunSun at Casa Marina, and made a dinner reservation for us. It is on the beach with tables widely spaced. As it turned out, dogs are not allowed. For non-dog owners, this hotel is in a beautiful oceanfront setting and the service is generally good. However, our oceanfront rooms were not up to par; they were small and bare bones.

The Staff is always extremely courteous and helpful 2. The rooms are very clean and comfortable 3. The food is delicious no matter where you dine on the property 4. The grounds of the property, including the beach and pool, are superbly groomed 5. The Gift Shop has wonderful property themed items, Starbucks, snacks and drinks (including beer and wine) This review is to make suggestions in two areas to improve my favorite resort. In fact, the people at Casa encouraged me to provide a review so here it goes. Regarding attire policy, for the beach ONLY, I would recommend that the property have a clear policy regarding topless sunbathing. During the week of this year's Fantasy Fest, there was a conflicting policy that caused confusion and frustration.. While my wife and I were on the beach we were informed that topless sunbathing was allowed and my wife was very excited to be able to work on her tan. Shortly thereafter, there was another communication that the policy did not allow topless sunbathing. The ladies on the beach were disappointed and voiced their displeasure. Shortly after that, we were notified that topless sunbathing was allowed. I understand that children are also at the resort and believe that the beach should be established as adults only, if only during Fantasy Fest week and that it be communicated to all who register that this is the resort policy. My only other suggestion would be for Casa to enable more resort-owned transportation. It was fantastic that they had a van waiting at the airport for guests upon our arrival and also had transportation available for our departure-talk about convenience! It might be worth it to increase that coverage for guests during Fantasy Fest. We tipped our driver upon arrival and again when departing so it would seem like a positive thing for everyone. In closing I want to make it clear that we have stayed several times at Casa Marina and will continue to do so in the future.

We had a really nice meal at a table on the beach. The food was great and we wished we had done that sooner. Next time! I do have one complaint.

On our first night we could not miss hearing the 40 minute arguement from the couple next door with distasteful bad language. I would have like to have seen what they looked like. Windows could not be opened. Drawer space was very limited and there was only one comfy chair in the room, with a tiny television. A resort fee of $25 per couple is charged whether you use the beach and pool areas or not. Staff in the hotel were not very friendly apart from the pool area.

First off, the staff is great, especially everyone that worked in the lobby (concierge, front desk and bellman). Our room was really comfortable, especially the bed. We really enjoyed the amount of natural light the room provided. The inroom amenities were also great...I never used my own shampoo/conditioner because I really liked their stuff. The pools were great but I didn't like feeling like I should need to tip the \"pool concierge\" after paying $25 resort fee per day. Now for the downside...we were really disappointed that our room didn't have a balcony or even windows that opened, if this is important to you, be sure to ask at booking. The beach is really small and once you are in the water, it is mostly rock. Also, they say that you can use the facilities at The Reach (the sister Waldorf Resort), however it was probably a 1/2 mile walk and they charged to give you a ride over. We also asked for a cab to the airport so we could take the seaplane and the shuttle the bellman called for us cost $8/person but on the way back, we grabbed our own cab an it was only $12. On a final note, and this does not have to do with the hotel...DO NOT take the pedicab home at night. They charge $1.60/minute and our trip came to a whopping $38 when a regular cab would have only cost about $5. It seemed like such a nice idea at the time since we were tired. Normally we just walked home because it's only about 20-30 minute walk depending on where you are at on Duval. Overall, we had a tremendous trip.

First, we got a terrible room facing the parking lot with a lot of noise. One person could barely fir in the tiny and awkwardly set up bathroom. When we asked for another room or an upgrade, we were told none were available that day, but we could pay $125 per night to upgrade. Curiously, that would me our rate above what we could book on the Internet at the same time. Then, in te middle of the night at 2am or so, the fire alarm went off for several minutes blasting through the whole hotel. Then again at 7am. This was pretty annoying, but particularly problematic since we had a 2-year old who was startled and had trouble going back to bed. Stuff happens but the hotel's handling of the situation and total disregard for need for accommodation was amazing and totally inconsistent with the Waldorf name. Instead of moving us to another room, of which plenty were available, the manager again insisted on charging us despite the inconvenience but $25 less. As an alternative we were offered an hour of late check out. Manager Mariya was not only unaccomadating but cold and rude.

Knowing it was a Waldorf Hotel my expectations increased. Arrived at hotel before 10 AM which I had told them. I was heading toward front desks and Patrick flagged me down, even though he was on the phone, saying he could help me. I wouldn't talk to him until he got off the phone so I waited a few minutes. I thought Patrick behavior was rude. Room was not ready, but he said he would make sure housekeeping would start cleaning as soon as it was vacant and checkout was 11 AM. He took my cell number and said he would call when room was ready. I checked back with Patrick at 11:30 AM he looked on computer and said they were cleaning it right now. We didn't get our room until 1:30 PM so I figure he was lying to me about what was going on. We had a Flagler room at $209. I paid $10 more than regular room which was $199 first part of November. The $10 got us a fairly small window facing the pools and ocean partly blocked by palm trees. The room room was also small with a nice closet, but no other storage space except for one shelf. We had to live out of our suitcases. The bathroom was really small 4\" x 5', plus shower. Double doors to bathroom because they opened in and a regular door would have hit the toilet. Very large sink that took away from limited counterspace. Shower only and small curtain that did keep the water from the bathroom floor. We had problems with our room keys the first night and went to desk twice getting lectures both times on how to use them, keep them away from phones, etc. They finally sent a service man to room and ended up changing the whole lock. Clock was 8 hours off and had to have service man fix it. Service at the pool restaurant was so the first day and a little better after that. Very limited menu. Seemed like they could of had more people working. The hotel grounds are very nice with two pools and a beach. The beach is part and part rock. The hotel has a resort fee $25 per day not including parking. We did get late checkout at 1 PM per my request before we arrived.

He should lead a class there in customer care for employees and management. When he is promoted and heading up management...then we will be back. This is an expensive resort and not worth it with the exception of the view. A $250 plus room (with several add on fees after) is not any bigger or better than a $70 room at a Marriot. The basic ammenities that are usually included in most places are extra here. Housekeeping comes when they feel like it and dont do all that great of a job. I had to call down at 3:30 when my room still hadnt been cleaned. They said they'd send someone right up. I went to kill more time (which I told them would be an inconvenience because I needed to get ready for rehersal dinner. At 4:15, still noone had been there. I called again and explained that at this point I just wanted towels and they could clean later while I was out. I then headed back up to my room where I had found that they sent housekeeping anyway and had to wait an additional 25 mins for them to leave. I had to ask housekeeping to actually take the trash with them. A server poolside spilled something on my daughter's jacket, said sorry and walked away. I had to go up to the bar to ask for assistance. Patrick came by and tried to assist with soda water. Graham also tried to help remove the stain. Patrick Morgan and Graham were both great, but was this their responsibility? I watched Patrick go over and tell Candace (who I was told later was an outside manager) what happened. She NEVER apologized and couldnt even be bothered to come talk to me or take the jacket to be cleaned. I went to inside management Maria (who was kind and handled the situation). I just thought the pool manager should handle issues by the pool especially when she was made aware of them. The hotel was at 100% occupancy and yet only one server was assigned to an entire pool and portion of beach. Needless to say there went the convenience of poolside service...you had to walk up to the bar or restaurant anyway. Hotel security was unprofessional, rude and disrepectful. Can we say power trip??

At 12:15 (45 mins later) we walked back to the check in point to ask the hold up. We were told the trip was cancelled because there were not enough people. When were they going to inform us? Oh wait it gets better...we then proceeded to the concierge (where we purchased the snorkle tour) to advise them of the mishap.

Our arrival date was the last day of fantasy fest and the place was buzzing with participants. The front desk staff were very helpful in orientating us on our first night and the room was good if not a bit 'cold' with tiled floors etc but applicable to the climate. bed was comfy, room amenities were good and we had no issue with the housekeeping as other reviews. We were very late leaving the room one day and upon return it was noted and turned down which exceeded our expectations. Staff were always approachable and helpful. Pool was good with all the expected extras for the $25/day resort fee. This also included use of beach furniture and games with water and ice pops offered on a regular basis. The setting and grounds are perfect and it was an enjoyable place to be. Unfortunately the sheen came off on the final days of our trip. The resort became part of our daily routine to escape the hustle and bustle of the town and relax. The final days of the stay were 'hijacked' by the expected Parrot Heads convention which converged on the island. Now i want to be clear that this isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t pure snobbery. Anyone who pays the money is entitled to their ideal stay but the hotel put on a musical stage in the middle of the bar/beach area and a Parrot Head tribute band played a limited set throughout the day and into the evening. Things deteriorated on our last day when the hotel hosted a convention for the Parrot Heads. The hotel was swarmed with people and I resented being accosted by the event security who had taken over the door who insisted I show my Parrot Head pass. I lost count of the number of time i had to explain to disbelieving security that I had no interest in the meeting and was just a paying guest. I felt that the Casa Maria 'sold out' their guests during this time in favour of the masses descending on the hotel - the menus were changed and cheapened, the music obliterated any idea of relaxing on the beach and it made us both feel like WE were intruding on THEIR event. it made for an uncomfortable end to an otherwise good stay. We sensed that the staff were sensing the divide between guests and visitors and were doing their best to smooth over the gaps, so credit to them for that. I would stay again but i would definitely check what events were planned to avoid the disappointment of having the relaxing atmosphere that the hotel markets itself as having, being potentially compromised again.", "Date": "November 9, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Amsterdam, The Netherlands", "Title": "\u201cBest way to visit the Keys\u201d", "Author": "BAPost", "ReviewID": "UR120391370", "Content": "Spacious place, very well suited for kids.

Was very impressed with property and how it is ran. Like my other reviews, I will try and point out the good and bad although hard pressed for anything bad here. Arrival: Check in was a breeze, plenty of staff to help and very pleasant. Parking options are valet at $20.00 day or self park at $12.00 day. The self parking is immediatley across the street in well lit area. Unless it was raining, I can't think of any reason to valet park as the lot is literally across the street. Room: We stayed in 263 which was a great room as it is just off the staircase and elevator (no noise from elevator though). The room is a handicap room and thus was larger and had more windows at it is on a corner angle. The room has the nepresso coffee maker, a refrigerator, room safe, ipod dock clock radio, and flat panel tv. The remote for the tv was a simplified remote that looked designed for hotel rooms which was nice as you didn't have to figure out which buttons to push to turn the thing on or get to the tv part. Also, the only way to tell the decaf from the non decaf coffee is to look at the foil on the end and it is imprinted on very lightly. Would be nice if the little box containing the coffee and tea had a little label saying which is which. The first full day we were there, we did not get maid service. Went by that evening when we got in about 10 pm and ask the front desk to make sure we got it the next day. The front desk immediately asked if we needed anything like towels and that they would note it in their log. They explained that they were switching their housekeeping management tracking system and for some reason, our room indicated that it was not occupied. The next day when we came back to the room, the room was clean and their was a hand written note from the housekeeping manager apologizing for the missed day and a bottle of nice red wine, glasses, and a corkscrew for our enjoyment. Very well handled. Property: Very well maintained. Had an issue with our door sticking and hopefully will get addressed. The grounds are very clean and well taken care of. There is a starbucks in the lobby. Pools were great looking. Only ate at property once and was late night at pool. Food was decent. Resort fees: Price does not include the $20.00 day resort fee which covers internet and some other stuff that should be included in the price anyway. Includes newspaper but we never got one. Discovered last day that apparently instead of putting at your door, they are available in lobby and on a little table on the floors. We never saw them on the table until the last day. Between self parking, taxes, and the resort fee, our $200.00 night rate was approimately $255 night. No big deal but posted on here so everyone is aware of it when making their decision on where to stay.

However the rooms were nothing special nor were any of the common areas such as reception, restaurant or bar reflective of the Waldorf name. The main thing going for the hotel was its beachfront location and it was a nice touch to have hammocks strung from the palm trees as they were very relaxing. Eating at the outside breakfast area or by the pool was an interesting experience as the brazen local birds would on accassion dive bomb the guests and grab food from plates or even on one occassion from one screaming young girl at poolside. Perhaps this is just a feature of beachside hotels. The local lizards roaming the pool are oversize (at least 12-18 inches) so recommend to those who like local wildlife. Staff were of mixed quality. Generally anyone poolside was very attentive (as is normally the case where service charges are a factor) and hotel side from good to poor. Again not what Waldorf stands for I suspect.

Exiting the lobby into the beach front courtyard is wonderful! There is a contemporary layout with pools to the left and right, and dining/bars to accompany each pool. The beach sets the horizon in the background. The service quality is a bit 'manic.' The lobby staff was pretty good. The housekeeping was poor. For instance, every day the housekeeper came to our room, she would ask my wife if she wanted a dish to replace the dirty one, or a new bottle of toiletry to replace the used one... very odd. She didn't close the open sofa bed either. Bottom line: the housekeeping was never a complete service. Another example: We were on the beach with a few friends, along with a few other groups of guests. The beach service attendant came by to tell us that although he had protested to his boss, he was leaving early for the day on boss's orders and this meant he needed to take the umbrella, chairs, and towels we were using. I was pretty shocked that he was told to leave early and then took our things. The bed squeaked with any slight movement whatsoever. However, the furniture in our suite was decent and it had plenty of room. We dined at the beachfront restaurant one evening, which was a nice experience. The wait staff was good and the food was great as well. The Bouillabaisse was excellent!

My husband has been a HH Diamond member for 15+ years, we have stayed at many WA hotels for vacations so keep that in mind when deciding if my review is helpful to you... At baggage claim, there is a phone to call for van service directly to the Casa marina, $8 p/p, no private car service from the hotel-that would be nice and would be willing to pay $50 each way for personalized service in a Towncar/MB, etc...The bellmen were fast and helpful, every time we were leaving/coming back they held the door open, asked if we need a taxi, even when busy-there were plenty of workers to help. The front desk check-in was ok, no one at the HHonors desk so we checked-in with everyone else. We paid for a basic room, usually get an Diamon upgrade and we did after 2 days. The first room was nicely appointed but very small with tiny,tiny,tiny bathroom and not enough space to hang/fold clothes for 2 people for a week but tall ceilings, large window, faux walnut floors and new bath. After 2 days they moved us to a MUCH larger room with large balcony over-looking the beach. This room was not in as good condition as the first but the trade off of large room w/ sitting area, huge bath and balcony w/ tons of storage was very welcome. I have to say that everyone we met at this hotel (workers) were very helpful, friendly, and seemed to like their jobs! Scuba Steve is one of the best assets that this hotel has. He is friendly to all, helps give suggestions of sun position for max. tanning or not, restaurant advice, tour advice and he is truely a happy, friendly employee and helped make out stay better. We tipped him $5/day and he always had our \"area\" set up with tons of towels and we didn't have to rush to get a chair/umbrella every day, so sleep-in! We did the jetski tour, 2 hours, 27 miles around the island, fun and cheap tour, only 4 othe couples went on the tour, we never wee on a jetski before and learning in 2 minutes. We did an 80 min. couples massage with Ellen and Lucy, one of the best massages I ever had (Diamond members get 10% off). We chose to have them done in the SPA vs. oceanfront for 2 reasons, 1) the beach smells like rotting seaweed and 2) not very private with vacationers walking by or can see you from their balconies, I think they should put up a trellis with vines or more landscaping on the hotel side of the massage area. We did the Sand Sculpting with MayAnn $49 p/p, It was fun, cheap, 2.5 hours, oceanfront and we had no experience and built a motorcycle out of sand! Mo-peds, we rented a mo-ped for 24hrs during an overcast day, we had fun (10% Diamond discount), went up and down ever street taking photos, we never rode a mo-ped and learned fast. The food/drink at the hotel- we only ate lunch everyday and breakfast 1 day, every dinner we ate out (I will do reviews on 7 restaurants that were all fabulous!), anyways, lunch was always great, good quality and hot, we like the blackened snapper or mahi sandwiches the best. The breakfast was ok, we had the buffet on the last day, $20 p/p ish which was fine but the food choice/quality was okay, but we are not breakfast people so... The drinks, everyday they had a drink of the day that they passed around at the beach/pool which was nice. My husband stuck to beer, in the hot sun he likes any light beer (colder) and they delivered. He drank Coors light, it was freezing cold, with little ice chips in it, he loved it. I had Prosecca (sp?) which was cold and they gave my own little bottle each time so it was like 1.5 glasses, very good. The negatives for us were: the mattress need flipped/rotated- very saggy, we tried to move out of the hole but always woke up in the hole and we like a soft pillow-top, I can't imagine people who like a firm mattress. The maid service was less then average, we tipped the maid $5 everyday and asked for more towels, she did leave more towels but I don't think ever mopped the floor, half-fast cleaned the toilet, never cleaned the balcony, just did the minimum, management should \"spot check\" the rooms and fire bad maid service. The beach smell, I guess I don't know what you do about that...everyday they did rake the seaweed into a pile, but the pile just got larger-we never saw them remove it, it stinks like sewer. Some people may like to be closer to the \"action\" of Key West but we loved the location. We walked everywhere day or night and felt safe. Its level so the walking is easy. You are removed from the action but can join in with a short walk! P.S. Stacy the conceirge was fabulous. She helped arrange every tour, dinners and gave ideas. She was very friendly, knowledgable and helpful.", "Date": "October 30, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Cedar Rapids, Iowa", "Title": "\u201cManagement is a joke!\u201d", "Author": "Pam B", "ReviewID": "UR119813128", "Content": "This is a very nice outdoor property & the employees that work outside \"the walls\" are awesome!

It reminded me of a 1970's Ramada Inn with a beautiful outside. The management was the worst part. On our first morning as we sat for coffee by the ocean a guy who was obviously in management just got in the face of one the beach boys and YELLED at him while we where 10 feet away. This lasted for 5 minutes. My husband called him Napoleon when he saw him again because he was so small. Two days later we had lunch by one of the pools and sat a couple tables from 3 people that in their words were the \"management team\", we later learned from the server that one was the general manager. I couldn't believe how open they were to discuss employee problems right in the cafe. Then when we checked out the man we now knew as the general manager walked right past us as we were having a billing question and the desk guy had a tough time explaining the $25 resort fee. He glanced at my husband and just got the heck out of dodge.

This hotel on first glance looks amazing. Private beach, grand surroundings and the Waldorf Astoria brand. However as a frequent traveller I can tell you this hotel is at best AVERAGE. The first thing is the rooms are standard fare that you can expect to find in any Hilton hotel. Nothing exceptional. Service is bad to average. Staff are clueless and don't offer that little extra you would expect for the price and class of hotel. The beach is nice but rocky. It's a busy hotel with around 330 guests and it can be a bit noisy. My biggest issues with the hotel are as a Diamond member you get nothing. No room upgrade, no free breakfast. Just a welcome drink and free Internet. You feel second class at this hotel especially if you booked a reward stay as I did. You will be hit with a daily parking charge of 15 dollars and a resort fee of 15 dollars which essentially gets you nothing. If you are a frequent traveller or a gold or diamond member I would say you will be terribly disappointed with this hotel. It's not a bad hotel but it is not special. It offers nothing you wouldn't get at a standard Hilton. If you don't travel so often you will likely find the hotel good. I would recommend the sister hotel \"The Reach\". It's an older hotel close by that has better rooms with balconies. Nicer furnishings and amenities, better sandy beach and friendlier more switched on staff. Note to Hilton, diamond travelllers deserve far better service and treatment at your top hotels regardless of if this is a reward stay or not.

We decided to have dinner the second night at the hotel. It was served in the fabulous candlelit setting of the beach front. Though the prices and menu appeared to be for sophisticated resort dining, the actual meal was produced in the tiny beach bar grill. The main dining room was not open, as I guess October is off season. Though the fish was fresh and well prepared, the sauce was dull, the salad was ordinary and the vegetables miserably overcooked. Dessert tasted as though it had come from the supermarket. Service was just OK. There also was a dopey selection of tired music on the speakers. The music at one point conflicted with other music from an event on an adjacent area of the resort, and we asked that it be turned off. There didn't seem to be anyone around who could handle that. So our dinner experience didn't live up to the superb setting. The breakfasts and lunch were more or less ok, though the service was slow.

Most hotels have no (or very small) beach areas. The Casa Marina (and sister property the Reach Resort where we have also stayed) have good beach areas by Key West standards. The Casa Marina is an older property, with a large variance in rooms. Some rooms are pretty bad (think no balcony, musty, ground floor parking lot view with headlights coming in your room at night). And some rooms are great-- large balcony wide open views. If you like to relax outdoors, it's worth the money to upgrade to a grand ocean vista (largest balcony available), or at the very least, an ocean vista (smaller, but more private balcony) to ensure a view. We were able to call ahead and talk with one of the managers to get the room we wanted. The location is nice. If you're used to walking a lot, we found it pretty easy to walk pretty much anywhere on Duval. We had our 7 week old baby with us, so were limited to walking with a stroller, but if you rent bikes, you can really cover a lot of ground. The dining options are endless in Key West. One of my favorites has always been Louie's Backyard for dinner (particularly the ahi tuna, always good). Latitudes Restaurant (at the Westin on Sunset Key) is also good, and a fun little excursion as you take the 10 min ferry to the island. If you like to go to the spa, definitely check out the Spa at Sunset Key (you can use facilities if you get a treatment even when not staying there), and also Little Palm Island (private island resort, amazing spa, you can be a guest if you spend a certain amount on the island). If you like boating & snorkeling, rent a boat and head out to Sand Key, one of the coolest snorkeling spots anywhere. The sea plane to the Dry Tortugas is also a really neat excursion. The Casa Marina has 2 nice pools, and the ocean is nice and calm and perfect for swimming, especially if you don't mind a little seaweed (have to enter from the wooden dock due to rocks).

We'd stayed at Casa before and had flawlessly wonderful experiences, but for some reason this time around (of all times!) they stuck us in an awful little room with a tiny window you had to stand on your toes to see out. The front desk seemed way less than interested in helping find us a nicer room--even for subsequent nights. So we headed out to the pool, a little dejected, and set ourselves up on two lounges under a sea grape tree. That's when Mark Gray came by and asked us how we were doing. We said we were doing fine, of course, and added almost as a footnote that it was our honeymoon. \"Did the hotel fix ya up?\" he said--to which we replied well, funny you should ask, but actually no. \"What's your room?\" he asked, and we told him, and he laughed and told us how those rooms were built by Henry Flagler as \"safe\" rooms for guests in case of hurricanes. \"I'll see what I can do,\" he said, and wrote our room number on the palm of his hand. Apparently, the room situation was dire--the place was sold out, and there was no place else for us to go (by the way we'd made our reservations months earlier, with the notation that it was our honeymoon). But that afternoon Mark returned with a \"Just Married\" balloon to tie to our lounges, and he sat down and filled us in, in great detail, about the most romantic places to eat on the island. He turned us on to the funky/friendly breakfast at Blue Heaven, the charming waterfall grotto at Michael's (where he called ahead and had them greet us with a complimentary split of champagne), the nice-and-easy lunch setting at Louie's Back Yard. Our second morning, we walked out to the beach and found our lounge chairs set up for us, again under the sea grape, again with a \"Just Married\" balloon and with bottled water and nuts and newspapers set out for us. What's more, when noon rolled around and it was time for me to see if a better room had become available, Mark came all the way in to the front desk with me (they ended up giving us a delightful little room just off the pool).

I was drawn to the hotel because of the package they offered (free upgrade, $75 food/beverage credit, and 10% off spa service). You will use up your $75 credit with 4 breakfast buffets ($20 per person/per day + tax). I wish I could say its worth it, but its not. You don't get a large variety of foods to choose from. We didn't get the free upgrade because the \"fine print\" said \"based on availability upon check-in.\" We were told the hotel was booked and they couldn't offer us the upgrade. Just book a beach front room and don't buy in to the package deals. Beware of the water bottles in the room. You have to pay for those too. There's no sign around them saying you will charged for them, but you'll see it on your bill when you check out. I don't think you want to pay $5 for a bottle of water. I suggest you go to a local store and buy water and canned beer. There is a small fridge in your room. Pool entertainment - NONE.

We were back last night and already booked another stay for Dec. 10-14, this hotel made this one of our most enjoyable vacations in a very long time.Derin, hope I spelled his name correctly, at the pool bar was a true mixologist he was great to talk to and went out of his way to make sure we enjoyed our stay.The coladas were the bomb. I wish I could remember the other bartenders names but for some reason I cant but they were good as well.Now on to the infamous SCUBA STEVE at the pool, this dude was awsome also he was full of energy and really enjoyed making people comfortable, he was there by himself our first day and we could tell everyone loved him. On the second day Steven was there with Steve and he was very good also, he knew how to perform his tasks flawlessly. The entire staff from check in to check out bent over backwards to make sure everybody was doing well.

The staff at the front desk were helpful, friendly, and went out of their way to accomodate our every need. If you need a taxi, the bell hops and valets will have one for you within 10 minutes.

He's witty, friendly, and takes the time to get to know your needs. The bartenders at the Sun Sun were wonderful! Darren was my favorite. He would personally deliver your food, drinks, etc. Very friendly and funny. And --- they ask your first name and remember it! Made us all feel special and appreciated. The wedding coordinator was fabulous! It rained all day on our son's wedding day. He had planned an outdoor beach wedding at 6 PM. The coordinator had the ball room set up and readyjust in case we needed it. At 5:45, my son made the decision that his fiance was going to have her beach wedding even if we had to stand in the rain. The coordinator and the hotel staff scurried to set up everything outdoors and were waiting with umbrellas to hold over everyone. The wedding started on time, the rain stopped immediately, the sun came out, and we had a beautiful rainbow during the entire ceremony! Gorgeous....

It has a private beach and you can go snorkling right off of their property. Great poolside service and food & drinks are delicious.

I would say this could be a really nice resort overall, but choose your room carefully. Ours, described as a suite with a balcony, was dark and dingy and the smallest \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcbalcony\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 I had ever seen. The balcony wouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have been any good anyway as the \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcview\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 was completely blocked by trees that the hotel have planted right next to the side of the hotel. \u00e2\u20ac\u02dca small dark outside area - ideal for growing mushrooms\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 would have been a better description. The \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcsuite\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 was very sparsely and cheaply furnished and the bathroom distinctly unimpressive. The bedroom would have won an award however for the loudest Air Con Unit \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the intake was so loud we had to switch it off overnight and bearing in mind we were on the top floor and one side was an inside courtyard and the other penned in by trees, there was no movement of air, so it was very uncomfortable. The small mini bar was empty. Another disappointing feature was car parking. Most people who arrive in Key West do so by car so I expect the hotels have decided it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a good easy opportunity to earn a bit more. We were there mid September but arrived in the dark. We were told we could park the car ourselves (there would be a $15 overnight charge) or valet park it for $20.00 per night. As we had just driven down from Ft Lauderdale I let the attendant park the car. When I got up the next day I realised the car had gone about 50 feet and was in an almost deserted car park with free street parking apparently available everywhere (The Casa Marina is further away from the \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcaction\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 than most hotels as its in a predominantly residential area) There were of course some good things about this resort \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the pool areas were nice and the staff were attentive and water freely available. The beach was nice and clean. The public rooms were large but very sparsely furnished and it looked like it needed updating. The hot part of the breakfast wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t the best - the ingredients (bacon, sausage) seemed low budget. The fruit and cereals were good. The outside eating areas were nice and lunch was very good. The highlight of our trip was the Jet Ski Tour which leaves from right next to the Casa Marina Beach but can be booked by anyone. It lasts two hours and goes right round the island with plenty of time to open the throttle and have a play \u00e2\u20ac\u201c great fun. Overall I would say very disappointing and way overpriced for the location and time of year. If I was forced to go again I would choose the best (most expensive?) room I could with a sea view. If you can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t do that I would choose another resort off trip advisor as there are plenty in better position (closer to the action) \u00e2\u20ac\u201c we would have expected more for $460 a night (including $20 parking) and I think it can easily be achieved elsewhere in Key West.", "Date": "September 24, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "2", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "UK", "Title": "\u201cOverall - average.\u201d", "Author": "Janet176", "ReviewID": "UR118505284", "Content": "We don't normally stay in \"resort\" type hotels - but we chose this one as my husband loves jetbiking and the hotel has bikes to rent directly on the beach. Arrival was a bit chaotic. We were in Florida for 10 days but our 2 nights happened to co-incide with Friday and Saturday nights when it seemed many people headed down to Key West for the weekend. The check-in staff seemed a bit flustered and the lady who checked us in seemed to be on \"automatic\" asking us 3 times if we'd had a good trip down. Our room wasn't ready so she took my mobile number and said they'd call us when it was. So we headed off to the bar for a couple of drinks. 2 hours later, still no phone call so we headed back to reception to be told that our room was ready and no reason given for not ringing. Our room was a fair size - but quite dark and dingy being down the side of the hotel. The bathroom was small and the water in the shower was tepid at best. The best part has to be the beach and pool - and the guys that work out there. They were really nice and very helpful, organising towels and loungers and bringing round ice lollies, iced cucumbers and frozen towels. My husband went out on a 2 hour jetski trip and had the time of his life. We didn't eat at the restaurant - but no-one else seemed to either.

When we arrived they check us in and gave us our keys. When we went up to our room, it was not the one-bedroom ocean view that we had paid for. It was a tiny room with a view of the roof below (#271). When we go downstairs to tell them there must be a mistake, they tell us they have nothing else and we have to stay there or in a room that is missing a wall!! Really?! They lied to us and didn't tell us that our room wasn't available from the beginning. They tried to accommodate us by charging us 119 for the room instead of the 369 that we had already paid for and that they could move us the next day to the suite. At this point our vacation was ruined. To us the hotel we stay in is a big part of our vacation and that is why we book ocean view at a Waldorf property. They next day when we go to the front desk we are given the worst customer service I have ever received. Maria Bennett has no idea how to deal with people. She said she could not give us the suite for the same price as the other room and that we would have to pay the regular price. Then she said she would take off $14. Big deal...its not the money, I was planning on spending it anyways when I booked this location. Then she tells us that we can either, stay in our current room for the current price, move to the suite for a discount of $14 off the suite price or CHECK OUT!! She said we had to hurry and make our decision because she had other customers to help. I think that if we had to spend the day before and that morning trying to get the correct room she could at least given us her time with a smile. So we took an offer we couldn't refuse and checked out to another hotel (Ocean Key) for the night. We were basically offered nothing for their mistake. Yea they \"knocked off\" 200 for the horrible room we stayed in, but we paid what it was worth. They charged us one night ahead of time so that they could guarantee that we would show up. What guarantee do we get that we are going to get the room we PAID for?? On a side note, the room we received had a welcome platter of chocolates and a card addressed to another guest, who by coincidence, we know. He says that when he got there he requested an upgrade. Did he get our room? I must also mention the Evelyn Summers was the girl trying to help us before Maria took over and she was very pleasant and understanding of our situation. I only wish she would have been able to help us instead of Maria Bennett. As for the hotel property and amenities, I can not comment because unfortunately we did not get to enjoy them.

The food, although nothing is wrong with it, is pretty unremarkable. The room was very small and the bathroom in particular needed some modernisation. The bed had a cheap base and made a lot of noise. The hotel has different wings to it and the main central section seemed far superior to the other wings so bear this in mind when booking. Although we enjoyed our time there, it is not what I expected for the chain or the money and I would not go back. The watersports department on the other hand were superb and I will review them separately as they made our stay in Key West memorable.

The hotel has probably the best location on the beach. This beach is much better than the beach at the sister property, The Reach. If lounging on the beach is your main priority, then this is the right place for you. Scubba Steve and Rob will hook you up with fresh, clean towels, hammock and a lounge chair, cold cucumbers for your eyes, plenty of ice water to keep you cool, popsicles and ice cold scented towels in the late afternoon. Those guys are great. However, the hammocks are filthy and should be cleaned/disinfected more often. The bar staff is also pretty cool. Rooms are nothing really special but who spends time in their hotel room when on the beach anyway? My biggest complaint about this place is the food. We ordered the mahi mahi tacos for lunch and after about 30 minutes they finally arrived and were under cooked and just thrown together. We also opted to have dinner at the hotel on the beach and, while the setting is nice, the food is terrible and extremely over priced for the quality. I ordered the sea scallop appetizer to start and indicated to our waiter that we'd be sharing it (there were two of us) and you'd think he'd mention that they serve ONLY one sea scallop at a price of $16! The sea scallop they served was too small to share. I also ordered the steak frites which is basically strips of steak served with french fries for like $28. NOT worth the price. I ordered my steak medium well but it came out over cooked and tough. The french fries were soggy with grease. Almost like they cooked them earlier in the day, let them sit out for a period of time, and then tried to recook them. I mentioned to our waiter that I was unhappy with my meal and that the french fries were soggy and he basically dismissed my complaint and brought out yet another plate of equally greasy french fries. Casa Marina is a nice resort and management should take pride in the food they serve. To the Management at the Casa Marina - your kitchen needs help. The food is poor quality. Your resort is very nice but you need to bring your kitchen staff up to par with the rest of the resort. The menu prices for dinner are ridiculously overpriced for the quality of food coming out of your kitchen. You are best to advise your guests to walk around the corner and enjoy a dinner that is both quality, and affordable, at Salute.

However the staff did move us to another room - with a amazing view of the ocean. First impression was WOW! It really is an icon in Key West. It is just lacking or a little off in many areas that you would expect from a 5star hotel. Keep in mind that Key West is a long haul for services like linen etc ... so sometimes this can mean the pool towels are late, but overall the staff do what they can to accommodate all guests. Rooms: Our room was beautiful, everything was clean and well presented and the King Bed was to die for! The upstairs room was also very nice - the sofa bed - it was not good, perhaps upgrade the mattress, but as we had young kids sleeping on there it was OK. Just would HATE to be an adult and have to try to sleep on the sofa bed. Nespresso machine - we love a espesso (not this Starbucks dirty water! Yuck!) So imagine our surprise when there was no cups, no caps, no sugar, no spoons ... nothing but the machine? How exactly are you suppose to make a coffee when there is noting to do it with? We called Housekeeping several times and NOTHING! Finally on the 3rd day we received 2 cups - but no caps, no sugar ... we were 4 adults?? REALLY if you are going to have a machine at least give people the necessities so they can use it. Internet: Was OK, speed was slow and dropped out regularly, but when you are on holidays this is not a huge deal. Breakfast: The buffet is good, though we are not big eaters - so we don't get value for money with any buffet. The menu breakfast is very good, but lacking in creativity. The service is VERY slow, there is many staff to a section and they really struggle with the couple of tables they have. The orange juice is wonderful! But at $5.00 a glass so it should be. Restaurants: Hmmm ... again ... VERY slow service. We went to sit down for a meal at 8.30pm and whilst we did not have a booking there were at least 9 tables free. Being 6 people, we understand that sometimes it can take a couple of minutes to put some tables together - however the VERY rude greeter, gave a huge sigh!! and said just sit at the bar it will take about 20 minutes to get your table arranged?? I am sorry. WTF? The 'manager' was no better, when we asked the reason for the delay, he simply replied - we are busy ... Busy are you serious? They had 4 or 5 tables with guests and 5 staff standing around doing nothing. Hence we left and went into town for dinner. Really the service staff here need to go work at a busy restaurant to see how it is done. Pool and Beach: The two pools are nice - not fantastic, in need of some TLC and there and overdue for modernization - but nice and they do the job. It was awful that you could not relax in the pool though - 20+ kids jumping up and down on a huge blue floating thing in the pool ... Really?? Not necessary and certainly not welcome, as there were a few too many ignorant parents not concerned with their children's behavior - where was the adults relaxing pool?? There isn't one! Seriously - I am not kidding, NO adults only pool. I would think that we are not the only adults that would have like to be able to relax, without getting 'bombed' or hit in the back of the head by the huge floating island. The beach - well ... its a nice beach - as good as you get in Key West and at least it is quiet and you can lounge back and relax there. You can try your hand at a little snorkeling - which our kids loved. Overall: The hotel was certainly beautiful, a true Key West icon. I wouldn't want to stay here if you are looking for a quiet romantic holiday. As there is not really anywhere on grounds that you can escape the chaos of kids and there are one too many ignorant parents, who seem to care little about others. The hotel staff are all very friendly and accommodating where possible. However the service staff are far too slow for a 5star hotel. Would I stay here again? It wouldn't be me first choice, Key West is for me highly over-rated and the 2br value for money at $800 a night ... is not really there. But there are few luxury properties with beach frontage in Key West. Personally - travel to a nice island in the Caribbean or Mexico with a nice beach.

We didnt spend a lot of time in the room watching TV, but when we did, the small size of the TV was annoying. It is about 1-1.5miles from Mallory Square and the main part of Duval Street. So, be prepared for a long walk or a $10 cab ride each way. If you want to be within easy walking distance of everything on Duval Street, stay at the Westin or the Hyatt. However, if you want a nice beach and pools, stay at the Casa Marina. The food by the pool/beach area was somewhat over-priced, but in line with what you would expect to pay at a higher-end hotel. Most of the ocean where you are swimming at is covered with some kind of seaweed on the ocean floor and is not the beautiful white sand that you might expect. The hotel staff was constantly cleaning, sweeping, vaccuming, etc. They did a very good job of keeping the place clean. Of course, they had to because of the large number of barefooted, wet, people walking directly from the pool all the through the very nice lobby. Overall, it was an amazing hotel, just pricey.

Barefoot Billy's beach/water acitivites Kiosk was the best!! We took their round-the-island jet ski tour which was fabulous-exciting-- Chris, our guide was engaging and fun - it was a blast!!! The highlight of our visit and highly recommended. This is a Wladorf Astoria Collection hotel and it needed to tweak a couple issues to raise it to that standard--First the hotel only had two guest internet computers and one printer --which was broked for three days- couldn't they find a repair man or get another printer. In addition, the Concierge desk is a standup desk at which staff have to stand all day and which can only acommoodate two persons at one time--- despite the fact that it is constantly busy - Move it to a sit down desk acorss the lobby (there's rooom) with at least three attendants to cover all the business--the hotel would make more money!!! . Three- the bed pillows suck- At a Waldorf level hotel most other chains have a selctions of pillows- here no--just the standard flimsy soft or foam pillows- I had to use four to get the height of normal firm one. In addition our bed leaned to the right and I slept in a groove-must have been a very old matress-- uncomfortable- Buy new quality matresses!!!

Tons of activities to do all week long, especially on the weekends. The hotel staff was extraordinarily obsequious and could not do enough for all of us. People kept coming up to me during meeting breaks and complimenting the Staff, the rooms, and the overall ambiance--many wishing they had brought along their spouses to enjoy all the resort had to offere and the after hours night life in Key West. Our Point of Contact for the second year in a row was Rebecca Atkins and she is the ultimate! I cannot say enough about how well-pleased we all were with the Conference Room, our rooms, and the provided amenities. She was there to greet us and she was available to ensure each and every day we were therethat all was moving along as intended, without any hassles, and that we were all pleased. Needless to say, all forty-plus of us were very well-pleased with what Rebecca had provided for us. Also, I would like to pass along my personal thanks and appreciation for a gentleman named Brandon. His wonderful demeanor, selfless attitude, his obvious devotion to his customers, and his penchant to not only help, but his seemingly innate ability to actually rectify on the spot all problems brought to his attention impressed numerous conference attendees throughout the entire week, especially those with room concerns, missing items, and personal issues in general. Brandon would actively and reflectively listen until the guest had finished, never once interrupting, and then would provide a viable solution to the guest's benefit. He assiduously provided only the absolute best service that the Casa Marina's professional staff had to offer! I can sum up his performance in the eight days I was there in just one word, supererogatory -- above and beyond the call of duty! Several of my conference attendees (and my wife and I) watched him over the course of a week and he treated each and every customer as if they were the ONLY ones there and that they were his ONLY concern! We were all more than thoroughly impressed. I'd like to point out several noteworthy situations. My room wasn't ready when I arrived and he helped out while Evelyn checked us in. He had our bags brought to our room for us and constantly checked on our room's availability. My wife and I had several issues with Housekeeping and he personally had each and every one of them immediately rectified. He ameliorated one family's perceived exiguous circumstances: late one evening a Danish gentleman explained how he and his wife had to be separated, each one having to take either one or two children, since they were separated from each other by not having adjacent rooms. Brandon explained to them that they would have adjacent rooms the very next day and for the rest of their entire sojourn (one for him and his wife and the adjacent one for the three children); he and his wife were ecstatic to hear that! I don't know HOW many times he was re-coding cards for people for their rooms and/or their parking. He diligently worked the Front Desk all week and many of us saw him fervently working outside assisting people with the loading and unloading of their bags. Our entire Team was completely satisfied (and then some) by everything that Rebecca had set up for us to make our stay and our work week memorable. Also, I just HAD to bring up Brandon's name as a true consummate professional within teh hotel's organization and I would be proud to have someone of his caliber on MY team, too.", "Date": "September 2, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "New York City, New York", "Title": "\u201cFamily Time\u201d", "Author": "Tracy P", "ReviewID": "UR117507477", "Content": "My husband, 4 year daughter and I spent 3 wonderful nights @ the Casa Marina!

I had high expectations for this property before we arrived and I was not disappointed at all! We stayed for 5 nights and wish we could have stayed longer! From the moment we checked in to the moment we left we were taken care of and the staff here made us feel welcome! The day we arrived they were busy and didn't have our room ready (we arrived before the 4 o'clock check in time) so they took my cell number and sent us out to the bar. It was worth the wait! We stayed in a 1 bedroom suite that overlooked the pool and ocean with a nice balcony. The room was really nice and the furnishings/decor was right on track for a resort in the Keys. Bathroom was well lit with premium bath products and soft fluffy towels (a bit disappointed with the size of the tub and the faucet (fixture) in the sink). The king sized bed in the bedroom was nice and the sheets/pillows were (above) what you would expect. We had water replenished each night and a espresso machine that made an excellent cup of joe. The only negative really is the noise level from the room next door (our neighbors had a dog that liked to howl when they were not in the room but only lasted one night). Room service was good and delivered on time. The best part of this was the gratuity was NOT automatically added on the check. I'm a good tipper, but I don't like to be forced to tip. I've never stayed anywhere that it was not pre-calculated on the check. The beach was awesome! Just steps from our room we could enjoy the sun and palm trees! The chair guys and wait staff made sure we had everything we needed! By the second day the guys setting up chairs on the beach knew our spot and would get us all ready! Drinks, food, cold towels and the wonderful ice cream treats were always welcome! Wish I would have remembered the names of the guys, but the guy with the goatee will take care of you. We had dinner only one night in the hotel out at the sun-sun. Service was great and the food was good. It was a little pricey but it is what you would expect. The grounds are well kept. The beach is really nice, but keep in mind it is a rocky beach and you can take the dock out to go swimming. We snorkeled right at the hotel and saw several tropical fish. If you want a more traditional beach just go next door to the public beach - We took the water way around the gate and just swam over. All in all I would stay at this property again! We booked our vacation early and got really good deals (plus booking during hurricane season gets you some good prices too).

This was our first visit to Key West and considered several locations before settling on the Casa Marina. I poured through several reviews on TripAdvisor and made our decision based on overall reviews, the appearance/feel of the resort and the fact that it's one of the few hotels on the island to offer a beach. Upon arrival at EYW, we only had to wait about 10 minutes for the shuttle which runs every 1/2 hour ($8/pp, same as cab fare). We arrived at the hotel well ahead of check-in but our friend's room was available. We requested and received an upgrade so therefore had to wait longer for our rooms. We checked our bags with the bellman and contemplated our next move. Unfortunately there was a considerable downpour outside so we used the time to explore the hotel. Not too much to see however the original structure built by Henry Flagler has a nice, elegant feel to it and the layout and landscaping of the grounds on the water side is done very well. A pleasing space to be in. We managed to make it to the poolside cafe during a brief letup in the rain and had lunch. We all enjoyed our food (wings, fish tacos, cheeseburger) and later discovered that the prices on the property were not too different from the places we ate at off property. This was a pleasant surprise. Our upgraded room was ready and we were afforded a pool/ocean view room in the original building with a large, uncovered balcony. The balcony accommodated 2 chairs, cocktail table, 2 chaise lounges and an umbrella. While this was considerably nicer than the island vista (parking lot view) room we originally booked, we discovered that we did not use the balcony very much. It's not that we didn't want to, but more often than not the air was very stagnant as whatever breeze there was coming off the Straits of Florida was being blocked by the beautiful palm trees. The room (276) was nicely appointed, the bath small but it was not an issue. Small refrigerator, safe, nespresso machine (never used), flat panel TV. An iron and ironing board as well as an umbrella were in the closet. A hair dryer was in the bath. A \"welcome dish\" was delivered to our room just as we were heading out. A couple of waters, petit fours, perhaps some fruit. We left it for our return however some unwanted guests, small ants, discovered it before we returned. This was the only problem with our room and was a constant throughout the week. If you have any food items, make sure they are in a resealable container or are kept in the fridge. Our friends' safe was not operating properly but it was fixed promptly. We spent some time with the concierge who was very helpful. I cannot recall his name however I know it was not Don with whom in had been communicating with via email prior to arriving. Don was also very helpful. The grounds/feel/vibe of the property was exactly what we were looking and hoping for. Nicely landscaped, somewhat formal, with two nice, equally sized pools. There is no hot tub/jacuzzi in case you are looking for one. The beach, albeit small, was a nice amenity to be able to lay in a lounge chair with the sounds of the water lapping ashore. The water is very shallow, lots of seaweed (I guess) and fish to swim with you. There's a pier with steps down into the water as well. The pool/beach staff were very accommodating and engaging. We enjoyed our drink of the day samples, Popsicles and frozen towels with eucalyptus oil. Additional notes/comments: Wi-fi: Free wi-fi on the property including the pool areas. If the breeze was blowing thebright direction, you can just barely ge a signal on the beach. Suggestion: 1 adult pool and 1 family pool, please. Internet Station: What's up with the internet connection for the concierge and at the 2 stations near the shop? Our payment couldn't be processed for a tour at the concierge due to a poor connection. I thought in heard the term \"dial-up\". Really?! Additionally, when trying to check-in online for my flight, it took an extremely long amount of time for the data to finally reach the printer next to me. The poor woman next to me had to wait about 10 minutes for her 10 boarding passes. Can this be addressed? Ants: Are these just a fact of being in the Keys or can this be addressed better? Location: Great location we thought as it was away from all the crowds of Duval Street and Mallory Square. Staff of Note: Front Desk - Jafre Concierge - Entire staff. We had dealings with Don via email, another gentleman (sorry, forgot name) as well as 2 female staffers. Pool/Beach Staff - Kyle, Steve & John Pool Bar/Restaurant Wait Staff - Darrin and a kind female staffer that was willing to locate a microwave and reheat one of our companion's leftovers from her previous day's lunch. Again, I apologize for not remembering her name. Just an example of going beyond to provide great service. Summary: Excellent stay, great staff, great location.

My sister and I are in our mid-twenties and my parents are in their sixties so it was a unique family trip. The resort is beautiful and well maintained, rooms were large and nice. We've traveled to many different resorts and do expect a lot as far as customer service and were sadly disappointed in our experience, it seems that either the staff is amazing and outstanding or terrible. We had a WONDERFUL experience with the pool/beach staff, especially Jake and Tyler who were great! The pools are both nice and not too crowded and we enjoyed the beach and swimming pier. There really is no other resort with beach access like Casa Marina which was what we wanted (and got!) We enjoyed the pool/beach amenities, but it should be known that the frozen towels/popsicles/etc are on schedule so if you miss the distribution you may be out of luck. Additionally, we learned that the pool staff are not hired through the resort and are not included in any type of tipping through the $25 daily resort fee. They did outstanding service for our family, if you have the same experience you need to individually tip the pool/beach staff. The restaurant was also very nice, especially for eating lunch on the beach. Daniel was especially excellent as our server multiple times. Additionally, my sister caught fish on a charter and was able to bring back the filets and the chef prepared them for us for dinner with a table right on the beach which was an amazing experience. As stated, the resort is beautiful, pools and beach are wonderful, and restaurant is good. We would not visit again in August because it was SO HOT we couldn't walk around anywhere....we spent a lot on cabs (also you should know that in cooler weather you can walk to Duval St. but that in the heat, or otherwise, cabs are by zone or if more than 4 people a flat rate of $3/person to cab most places). We were glad to use cabs and not have to worry about a car/parking. All that said, beyond the superb individuals mentioned, service was lacking. Specifically, we had lots of issues with housekeeping. Some days we were left without towels, others without shampoo/conditioner/etc, and housekeeping was SO NOISY that we often had to leave the room because they were screaming up and down the hallways. Timing was also unpredictable, most hotels/resorts I have experienced the room is cleaned at roughly the same time each day, here it was typically very late in the day and caused issues with showering after the pool/beach before dinner time. Additionally, our final day I booked our planes late to leave Key West in hopes of an additional pool/beach day but we had to check out at 1pm (they wanted to charge $50 for each additional hour we kept the room!) and they have no showers available beyond the rooms so we were unable to have an extra beach day. I think this resort will be great a few years but the staff may not, in your experience, live up to the Waldorf experience, though after looking and walking all around Key West I still think it will be the absolute best resort experience on the island for your vacation. The resort will also be much improved when they have their own separate spa building which is under construction. The building itself is breathtaking, the views are great, and if you luck into dealing with great staff like we did you should have a very good experience!

Rooms We had a basic bedroom w/ king bed. The bedroom area is very open and spacious, with a small armchair to the side and a bench at the foot of the bed. Full size closet with robes off to the side of the room, which is nice so you don't see your luggage mess when you walk into the room. Bathroom was surprisingly small - contained only a shower stall (no tub), and little sink space. Bathroom definitely felt that design was valued above functionality. The sink faucet is off to the side so it's easy to spill water out. The shower stall is half glass and half shower curtain so you have to keep the water aimed to one side to avoid water from spilling out (this angle would suck if you were taller). Aside from these nitpicky things, no other complaints on the rooms - the look was nice and most importantly, everything was clean. There's also a nespresso machine and a small fridge that had enough empty space to put fruit, water bottles, etc inside. Location Casa Marina is on the south side of Key West, while Mallory Square is on the opposite side to the north. You do need to cab everywhere (around $8-11) if you want to avoid walking in the sun/heat. It's about a 20 min walk to Duval street, and you can slowly go up that street to Mallory Square, but it is quite a bit to walk. The activities we were doing all left from the north side of the island, so we had to keep cabbing over to areas near Mallory Square. The hotel is a bit aways from most of the nightlife, shopping activity. El Siboney (great cuban restaurant) is about a 10 min walk away. The Reach resort, also a hilton property, is close by. Airport transportation is best via taxi, $8 per person. Resort The resort has its own little manmade beach, and is beautiful to look at. I also have to warn you that the beach has shallow water when you enter, but there's a lot of grass growing which creeped me out as I waded through. Sunning chairs and hammocks abound and you can have them help you place chairs wherever you want. There's also two large pools. The resort fee covers the following: wireless internet on property, gym, use of beach volleyball, bocce, pool table, pool toys, hammocks, pool concierge service (popsicles, drinkOTD samples, frozen face cloth that smells like benzocaine), free phone for local and w/in the US calls, newspaper. There's dining by the pool/beach at the Sun Sun grill (typical fare, questionable service from here), there's a lobby bar that services absinthe, and a small gift/supplies shop. The Reach resort nearby has a steakhouse and terrace dining. What would make this place great is if it had its own quality restaurant for dinner on the property - i would just stay right on the resort all day if they had this. We also got two free bottles of water a day, which is a nice touch. Service Housekeeping was great at keeping the place clean the days we spent here. We did call for extra shampoo, but the person gave us ONE bottle of body wash. Not the same. I got a spider bite, and the front desk staff were great. This was late at night, and they called for someone to apply some gel for the bite, and gave me a free bottle of benadryl to help with the itching/swelling. Was a very nice surprise, and was very much appreciated. The concierge for booking activities was a bit different though. They were very helpful and nice but it took me 30 minutes to book a snorkel/sailing trip. I asked about the snorkel and sail trip on the list of activities and how it differed from Danger Charters since the price and description sounded the same (Danger Charters I had separately found on tripadvisor). The guy was like, yeah the two things are pretty similar. Another person there, then told me that the pamplet of activities was very outdated and that the location to meet didn't exist anymore. She then looked through her series of pamphlets and figured out what snorkel/sail the activity was now booked through (ended up being Danger Charters). Everything turned out great but it was just a bit disorganized and confusing to book with them.", "Date": "August 5, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Milford, Delaware", "Title": "\u201cFabulous break from reality!!!

If there's something you need, he will find a way to get it for you. He's a fine young man and his parents should be proud of him. We took the jet ski tour around the island from Casa Marina. For three people who never were on jet skis before, they made it very easy for us! (Recommendation by Max and Mark). We went on the Ghost Trolley Tour which provided a lot of history about the island along with a lot of laughs! (Recommendation by Max and Mark) One excursion you should not miss is the half day (4 1/2 hours) sailing, snorkeling, and kayaking by Danger Cruises. For $75 each, you sail, snorkel, and kayak. They provide soft drinks, beer, wine, water, fresh fruit, chips, etc. during the cruise. Awesome cruise - would do it again! Another recommendation by Max! The only recommendation I would make at the Casa Marina is the pools need a cooling system. This past week it was extremely hot and the pools get extremely warm - it's not really refreshing after sitting in the sun for awhile. Remember to have your flip flops at the pool - otherwise your feet will burn. The food and drinks at the pool are great. You might want to consider splitting 2 meals among three of you because they give you plenty to eat.

This was our first trip to Key West and we were not sure what to expect. We were blown away! The hotel is beautiful. I am a Diamond member with Hilton Honors and we stayed on points. However, we upgraded to a one bedroom oceanview suite for a small additional nightly fee. Thanks Brandon!. The room was perfect for my family of 4 and had an outstanding view. As I read the other reviews, the housekeeping staff did get some negative comments. I must say, we did not experience any of this. Our room was cleaned promptly and when we requested additional towels and sheets and they were right on it. I do have to say that the service throughout the hotel was great. Especially the beach and pool staff. We met Max on our first day and to be honest, we give him credit for making out trip fantastic. He spent quite a bit of time each day giving us suggestions on excursions and restaurants and getting our chairs on the beach or the pool. Max made all of our reservations for us. The waverunner tour of the island, the sunset cruise, the sailboat/snorkeling/kayaking 1/2 day excursion and our scooters for the day. He is truely an asset to the Casa and anyone going to the Casa should find Max on the beach and let him help you make your trip the best! Thanks Max! Hopefully we will see you on our next trip to the Casa! As the excursions go, we were extremely happy with Barefoot Billys which is located on the Casa's beach. Not having to travel to get to the excursions was a huge plus. The waverunner tour is a must do! Don't leave the island without doing this! One other must do is having dinner at Latitudes on Sunset Key. It is well worth the cost! We had the 7:45pm seating so we got to enjoy the sunset from our table outside. The dinner and view of the sunset was amazing and not to be missed. Thanks to the Casa and Max for one of our best trips!

Although there are many wonderful places to stay in Key West, we wanted to stay where we could soak in the \"flavor\" of Key West, but also someplace that offered a more resort-like experience...truly, the Casa Marina had both. It is one of the most historic and well-known properties on the entire island, as it was financed by Flagler in the early 1900's. The lobby is beautiful, with the original circa early 1900's hardwood floors and staircase. The pools and grounds are very beautiful and well-maintained, reminding us a bit of the Grand Wailiea in Maui, which is also a Waldorf Astoria Resort. Our room was quite spacious and the bed was VERY comfortable. We LOVED the extremely large balcony we had (that had wooden plank flooring, 2 chaise lounges, 2 chairs, a small table and large umbrella - I joked that we could have easily entertained guests on it). My husband was not crazy about the fact that although we had an \"ocean front\" room, there were so many palm trees on the property that we could barely see the ocean! (Personally, I liked the palm trees!) The resort beach is small, but one should not go to Key West expecting expansive sandy beaches. The beach was well equipped with comfortable lounge chairs and several hammocks tied between palm trees. Honestly, to me, there was nothing better than lying in the hammock and listening to the palms rustle in the breeze! Another highlight was eating breakfast each morning literally only steps away from the beach and the ocean. (The food quality was also quite good.) Bike rentals are available at the resort, and we enjoyed riding to several places in town and along a path that runs along Smather's Beach to the airport. We only had two complaints about our room: the bathroom was quite small (but that is to be expected in a historic resort, as I have experienced in other fine historic hotels such as the Don Cesar in St. Petersburg, FL and Hotel Hershey, Hershey, PA), and noise easily tranferred through a connecting room door...or maybe the gentleman in the room next to us was just very loud while talking on his phone. The only other downside is that the resort is a bit further from Duvall Street and many of the prime attractions than other smaller Inns or B& B's...but the upside to that is that it is much more quiet and peaceful not being in the middle of all the action. Honestly, we were able to walk or take an inexpensive cab ride to wherever we wanted to go. The Old Town Trolley also stops right at the resort, so that makes sight-seeing a bit easier if you don't have a car. Would I stay at the Casa Marina again? Absolutely.

I began using this site a few months ago when trying to decide where to vacation in the Keys - what a great website. So, I felt since many people use this when deciding on vacation, I should include my review: First let me say the resort property is very nice - pools and beach are beautiful. The lobby is very comfy but the couches and pillows could use a cleaning. Our room was not ready when we arrived at 2pm so we went out to Sun Sun for lunch - very nice place to have lunch. Our room was ready at 4pm. Our ocean vista suite was clean and very comfortable. After the first night I requested a room change - the noise from Higgs Beach and the street was unbelievable. The Casa changed our suite that day and put us in a very nice, quiet suite. When booking, request a room/suite not street side. I had read (and still do) about the excellent pool/beach service. I must say, I was not that impressed. We stayed during the week of July 4th. We paid $25 a day for a resort fee which includes \"complimentary beach/pool chairs and umbrellas.\" Well not on July 4th. If you wanted a beach chair the beach/pool guys were charging you $10 extra per chair. Note to yourself - if you're staying over a holiday, be prepared to pay extra for the beach. We made use of Barefoot Billy's for a waverunner 2 hour tour (right on Casa's property.) The tour guide Kris was exceptional. As it was a mixed group of experienced and new riders, he found the perfect balance - would highly recommend doing this. A couple of meal suggestions - best wings we ever ate are in the Rum Barrel - you have to try them! Prime 951 - EXCELLENT Steahouse! Was recommended by a cab driver and was a wonderful way to end our vaction in Key West. Abit pricey but worth it.

The hotel was special to me since I have stayed at this hotel since it was the Flagler. Although we were not asked for our Hilton Honor card we stay at Hilton's and Hilton family hotels a considerable amount of time throughout the year. First, the great things about the hotel... the grounds/location of the hotel are very well kept, Elaina- at the pool service was very attentive, Jesse- the Bellman was so very helpful, the beach/pool area and the bar girls who made an effort to make my birthday very memorable, Judith- at the Spa did a great job and the gym was well appointed. Now, the trip could have been ruined if we had let it by a very confrontational front desk attendant named Brandon who insisted we housed our 13 pound King Charles Spaniel illegally in our room and could not help us with house keeping. My husband DID inform the hotel about our pet when making the reservations and again when checking in. We are used to the additional pet fee and gladly pay the fee so that we can travel with our pet. Both times my husband was told there were no problems- the Casa was a \"pet friendly\" hotel- until Brandon decided to make an issue with our pet. My small dog has traveled extensively her whole life and is very quiet and calm. In fact, on this trip I am 100 percent sure that she acted better than the locals that laid out next to us on the beach the first day and were too intoxicated to walk, the wedding party that kept us up until 3:00 a.m. on Sunday morning and the child in the swimming pool with a regular diaper, not a swim diaper, just to name a few incidents that ensure she behaved. We asked Brandon for our room to be cleaned not once, not twice but three times, yet it was NEVER serviced and after the fact we were told that it was because of our dog, yet we had not been informed that all we needed to do was be in the room with our pet while the cleaning ladies did their work. After the fact, we were also told that house keeping was scared to DEATH of dogs. Realizing our room was NOT going to be serviced probably from the laziness of house keeping, not my dog in her kennel, we simply asked for towels, yet we never saw fresh towels, wash clothes, toliet paper or tissues. The front desk did offer a peace offering of a bottle of wine yet at this point all we wanted were clean towels. If the hotel claims \"pet friendly\" the entire staff should be just that. Brandon obviously has more on his mind than being hospitable and welcoming.

Our kids are 20 and 18 so we have the freedom of adult like experiences while we are away. We tried to book Hilton at Key Largo Grand Vacation hotel but were unable to apply my points to that property for our entire vacation. This led to a Hilton advisor to suggest a Waldorf property in Key West, Same points and a higher class hotel. Interesting that with my Gold Hilton status, I take for granted a free breakfast buffet daily. My family is good with cereal, yogurt, oatmeal, fresh fruit and on occasion scrambled eggs and bacon. All included. At Casa Marina, breakfast is $26 pp. A bit over the top I would say especially since we are staying 5 days. That's over $500 just for breakfast, ouch. Challenge to be in Florida in the summer is that it is hot. Not just that the sun is hot, but the sun will crisp you up like a nice piece of applewood smoked bacon. Go for a dip in the pool to cool off.....nice try. Pool is 80 degrees! Let's walk down to ocean and jump in....oh my, equally as hot. No place to cool off. Our room is okay. Not much space to put clothes for 4 people. I decide to work out of my suitcase and the girls fight for limited drawer space. This room is smaller than a Hampton Inn room I get traveling on the road for business for $99 a night. And that room does come with a very decent breakfast and warm cookies at night. Okay, enough trashing the place, there are a few highlights. The gym or fitness center is across the street in an old house but is freezing cold and has enough equipment for at least 10 or so to be there at once. We had no problems finding an elyptical and a tread mlll. Free towels and small cold water bottles. Very nice. Also, the outside bar was very good for my daughter and me to watch the US Women's World Cup and the American team beat France 3-1! Daniela was very attentive and nice to us. No attitude when we just wanted cold water. I did have a few beers and ordered the fried conch and it was warm, crunchy and filling. Also, the boys at the pool and beach were terrific. Tyler and Jake in particular were funny, entertaining and extremely attentive. They set us up on the beach with 2 umbrellas as I do not do full sun. They frequently checked in on us, delivered ice pops and frozen wash cloths with eucalyptus. Refreshing! Also Deon was always there when we needed her.

Probably what sets it apart from the other hotels is that it is situated on a private beach on the Atlantic. Absolutely beautiful. I loved combing the rocky beach for shells. Then if we wanted to swim in the ocean, all we had to do was walk out onto the pier where a set of steps takes you down into about four feet of water for swimming. Smaller kids enjoyed exploring the rocks for shells and snails. And there is also soft sand where beach chairs and hammocks await. Next, they have two lovely swimming pools which face the ocean before you get to the beach. Well sized. Comfortable water temp. We really enjoyed the pool. There are two stations where you can ask a towel attendant for towels and assistance with beach chairs. The attendants were super friendly and helpful. Waiters come around for drink orders. There is also a bar and poolside dining area. The drinks were delicious and the food was also good. Have the pina colada. A great perk of Casa Marina is the concierge. See Don. He knows where all the good restaurants and site seeing trips are. We're not kidding! He directed us to the best dining and to the two side trips we took. A Sea Plane to Fort Jefferson and a relaxing Catamaran trip. We used the valet service often. The valets were really great. They also like to recommend dining places, and they too know what they're talking about. The grounds are lovely. The lobby is historic and stunning yet comfortable. It is important to note that in the gift shop, they have coffee and muffins and fruit in the morning as well as ice cream throughout the day. This is handy if you don't feel like having a full morning meal. There is not a full service-type restaurant on the premises, but they do have a large room and outdoor seating for a morning meal. This can include an all you can eat buffet. I can't recommend this as it was very expensive. They do also have items to order such as bagel, fruit plate, oatmeal etc. We found those to be a better bargain. Sit outside, the view is stunning. Our room was serviceable and comfortable, but not large or decorative. We had two adults and two kids in a room with two qeen beds. It did get a little tight with suitcases and swimsuits. Don't bother bringing beach towels. The hotel offers them at the pool and we were told we could bring them on the sea plane outing we booked through the hotel. Also, there was no place to dry the towels. The bathroom was clean and serviceable. Large shower, no tub, which I preferred. The room might have benefitted from towel bars, a little more storage space and more colorful artwork. However, we spent much of our time out of the room. And I do recall we were able to sleep comfortably and that is really all that matters. No noisy air conditioning and the beds were very comfortable. We also took advantage of their bike rental service. The bikes are well maintianed and fun to ride, although I would recommend riding to the beach path to the east rather than in the more congested areas of Duvall street, et al. We also used the jet skis. I have mixed reviews here. As we were inexperienced and went out on a very choppy day. The group leader rides very fast and well ahead of the group. I think this is intentional so people do not ride too close to one another causing wakes and waves. However, it was difficult to keep up and an adult member of our party did fall off. She was helped back onto the jetski by the leader and we were given the option of being dropped off at a sister hotel and bussed back to the Casa. All ended well. But if you're not adventurous, I'm not sure we can recommend beginning to ride a jetski in salt water and on the ocean. It was definitely a rigorous adventure.", "Date": "July 10, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Chatom, Alabama", "Title": "\u201cGreat hotel!\u201d", "Author": "KBDonald", "ReviewID": "UR115217115", "Content": "Beautiful hotel.

Food was good but we only ate there for lunch a time or two. I didn't find it extremely over priced but you can really get more for your money by eating downtown key west (especially if you're having a drink or two) Room was cleaned and turned down daily and we could easily walk anywhere we wanted to go in Key West from the hotel.

What was most dissappointing about this one is we came from the Mandarin in Miami Brickel Island and paid less the same as this Waldorf. The Mandarin I didn't feel so bad about spending 6.00 for a cup of coffee, they made me feel like it was worth 6.00. Ever time I spent money at Casa Marina (i refuse to refer to it as a Waldorf Astoria - it doesnt do the brand justice) I felt like I was being reamed and I was over paying. At dinner offisite after one item that broke the camels back I actually had to write down all the issues I had with the hotel to speak to them when I got back. 1. Drove up with my rental after a nice peaceful ride down - took me 10 minutes to get out of my car and get someone to help me with my luggage. 2. Checking in I was standing with a 4 year old for 20 minutes since they had only 1 person checking people in at 4:00 in the afernoon!. 3. It took almost 30 minutes to get our luggage to the room. 4. Carpet on the 4th floor was stained and maintenance room that was in serious dissaray was left open as soon as I got back into the building ( guests don't need to see this) 5. Me and my wife got food poisoning from the fish taco's by the pool BOTH OF US 2 hours later just as we were going to the Weston's Island Restaurant which we couldn't enjoy we since we threw up earlier and had the runs the entire first 1hr of the meal and had no appetite. PLUS everything everyone says about service by the pool totally dead on, NO ONE was there, there were no one to hand out towels, I had to wait around for 20 minutes for someone to get them and they brought 2, one for my wife and me to share and one for my sone I guess there was a towel shortage in the keys. 6. THIS WAS THE KICKER - concierge liseth or something from south africa, told us to go to a restaurant, would be perfect. We arrived at the place and asked the hostess for her honest opinion, where we should eat as a family that is kid friendly, (no one was really at the restaurant and that kinda worried me) she gave her nice honest opinion and said that the owner of the restaurant also owned another restaurant around the corner, that is more kid friendly. We went there and had a great dinner. We saw the concierge the next day and she asked how the dinner was, we stated we went to one of the other restaurants from the owner recommened by the concierge..... 3 hours later my wife gets a call in the hotel room, person has my room number and my last name... we are considering firing the hostes..... we want to know exactly what she said to you???? We downplayed the whole thing, how dare the concierge get us involved in this, she must have been soooo worried about her kickback from the restaurant she tried to get the girl fired, and also gave our information out so the manager of the restaurant called us directly. ARE YOU KIDDING ME????????. after our dinner at the westin ( I HAD SUCH HOTEL ENVY ) i went up to management, where they removed my resort fee ( thanks soo much I didn't realize i had to pay that 30.00 plus parking 25.00 and the room 330 or 360.00 for the night. and then removed half of one nights stay. thank you for that, however I will NEVER ever stay at this hotel again even if they paid me too, and I will always remember it as the worst hotel experience ever. Now I remember having 8 points on that paper I wrote down so I'm sure I'm missing a couple of important factors, but hopefully you spend your money elsewhere in the Keys. Also Thank you in advance Brandon Kuhn for your boiler plate \"i'm sorry, we'll learn from this experience\", my advice to you, is start over with the staff and for God's sake don't call this place a Waldorf, because if you are going to charge these prices and have that name, you better darn well live up to it.", "Date": "July 7, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Mesa, Arizona", "Title": "\u201cLOVE THIS PLACE!!\u201d", "Author": "honeymooners_2011_2", "ReviewID": "UR115103850", "Content": "My new husband and I traveled to Key West 4th of July weekend for our honeymoon and stayed at the Casa Marina and it was beautiful!

I ordered a salad from the pool bar (which is the only restaurant on-site) and it took ten minutes for a server to come up to us just so I could order. There were 4 pool servers standing by the bar chatting the whole time we was waiting for service. After finally being able to order, the waiter (her name was Deon) brought me the wrong salad and then tried to tell my boyfriend and I that I ordered chicken salad (which I do not eat chicken). She said I would have to wait longer if my order changed and I did wait, and the pool server staff started making rude comments as they walked by our table....absolutely ridiculous. This is just one example. Another example is the service at the concierge (or lack thereof). We called down to the concierge to have a cab called for us so we could make it to our dinner reservations. The concierge attendant said \"Oh, you just have to come down and wait. We're not really the type of place to call ahead for you.\" EXCUSE ME??? This hotel is $300 a night!? What the heck is wrong with these people? Another example of this horrible service is when we went downstairs to speak to someone at the concierge about our party's wedding plans (which were at the Casa Marina). We waited 30 MINUTES for a concierge attendant to come down, but no one was available and the front desk said they couldn't help. We left without getting results from anyone. The whole 3 days we stayed at the Casa Marina our experience was like this...the maid wouldn't come to the room unless we called down to the front to remind them we needed maid service.

The staff was not friendly from entering the front doors which most of the time I opened myself and waited while other rude guest filed in. Not one housekeeper said so much as \"Hello\" in the hall. The valet brought my car and asked if there were others coming and then vanished without helping anyone with the luggage. The elevator to the 4th floor was stuck on the first and when I told the desk they could not have cared less even though my two friends were at the top with luggage waiting. I carried mine down the staircase. But they were happy to take the $25 resort fee a night that I didn't know anything about until I got the bill. Room service did not answer so pizza was ordered at a late hour and then we were called from the front desk to come get it. Even though I realize Key West does not hold up to the standards of New York or other large cities I really thought (and bragged) about how good the service would be since I have stayed at the real Waldorf Astoria. They should just stick to calling themselves a Hilton owned property and not trying to just the Waldorf name.

Having said that, I slept well in the room, it was comfortable and very quiet at night. The A/C worked great. There was a free espresso coffee maker in the room and a pull out sofa bed in addition to the separate king size bed in the bedroom with door. I noticed in some reviews that people were surprised there was a resort fee and that parking was not free. My only comment is that they must not have done one iota of research before booking at the Casa Marina. I knew about both the fees before I went and it was simply because I had reviewed the Casa Marina website. It's not like they're trying to hide anything. All the hotels in Vegas now charge a resort fee which includes things they would separately charge for in the past like internet, newspapers, etc. Free parking is almost never found anymore... Getting back to my review: The entire staff of the hotel was great. The concierge desk was extremely helpful with helping us get setup with activities and dinner reservations. I never felt rushed speaking with them and felt I got 100% of their attention. The beach staff was also excellent (Mark, Tyler, and Jon). I would disagree completely with a comment I just read that staying at the Casa Marina was like staying at a Fairfield. There's no comparison! If you like a nice beach and beautiful swimming pools and the extra special touches like having your sunglasses cleaned, receiving a frozen towel in the afternoon after a hot day of sunning and swimming. Fruit flavoured water...It was generally just very laid back and yet elegant. The location is good. It's on the Atlantic side of KW. We walked everywhere - I believe it's about a 2 mi walk to the Gulf side for the fabulous sunsets. If you don't wish to walk there are bike rentals available and lots of Taxi's. We did the Parasailing adventure (my first time) and it was AWESOME!!!! We also did a bike tour of the island which was also awesome and very interesting. It's an easy place to walk and/or ride b/c it's so flat. Don't miss the Hemingway House and the Butterfly museum (if you so inclined). All in all KW is a great place to unwind.

The staff were at best unfriendly at worst surly apart from the beach/pool staff who were extremely helpful to please, especially one young Irish man. The buffet breakfast was not up to the standard of a truck stop with lack of selection of 'cold/hot food'. The rooms were disappointing with lack of view (over the car park) and no balcony.

There was so much that i loved! First off, 90% of the excursions were offered right at the resort. They made it extremely easy to sign up, and it was, literally, a one minute walk to the pier where the excursions left. Second, the staff was amazing. They treated you like kings and queens. I loved the \"free\" sample alcoholic drinks, popsicles, fresh fruit, and even sun glasses cleaning at poolside! (which really ended up being included in a $25 fee you prepay when you book the room, but it was nice to get it without shelling out cash or handing them your credit card). Dont fret about getting a taxi! They call one for you that comes in less then 5 minutes, or they are waiting across the street. The staff really go out of their way to make sure you are comfortable and have everything you need. They were really nice and always served you with a smile. I especially felt compelled to right this review when I lost my cell phone at the pool, and the staff took time out of their schedules to search through over 30 bins of towels to find it!!! And, they DID find it! Amazing! Third, the resort was within walking distance of Duval Street which was basically the night life of Key West; it included lots of stores for shopping and restaurants such as Margaritaville, their famous Sloppy Joes, HardRock Cafe, and lots of bars with live bands. Now I must say, probably the only thing that could have been better were the rooms. What I mean by that is they were not very convenient for \"settling\" in. We had a standard ocean-side room with double queen beds and a balcony facing the pool/ocean (which was amazingly beautiful!), but, with a family of four, the bathroom and the room had NO space for storage! It was really inconvenient to pack up my toothbrush, facewash, and other necessities EVERY time I went into and out of the bathroom. The shower had no space to put anything and no place to sit down (if us ladies wanted to shave our legs). There was no tub, so small children couldnt take baths. Granted, the other rooms may have been different, so make sure to check that out when you book! The room had two large chairs in the corners which could have been replaced with some units with drawers for storage. I know Im on vacation but I dont want to dig through my suitcase, everytime, to find anything. And everything seemed to end up on the floor or the bed because there was no place to put things. Anyway, with the bad aside -----which isnt sooo terrible---- I really would recommend this Resort to anyone.

The hotel is a very nice and historic place and we absolutely loved the island of Key West. We chose this hotel because we are Hilton Honors Gold members and we had enough points to use for both nights we were there. It was a little bit of a walk to the sights on Key West but one that we always enjoyed. We had a little bit of an issue when we checked in because the first room that they placed us in constantly shook. When we called the front desk they immediately knew of the problem and after initially telling us that we could switch rooms the next day, we were able to switch rooms to one that didn't have a constant reverberation. It's kind of strange that they would put us there in the first place. It was actually bad enough that the glasses in both the bathroom and on a tray table in the main room were \"pinging\" like crazy. I initially thought there was a big rig outside the window but when I went around and outside there was nothing but vents and what looked like AC units making a bunch of noise outside as well. Very strange indeed. Once we got all that taken care of we were able to enjoy the pools and the beach area. The pool staff went out of their way to set us up. The pools were pretty warm which felt nice at first but then after a day of walking around the island in 90 degree heat, I personally wished they were a bit cooler. My wife thought the temp was perfect. The room was renovated and nice. The bed was a little too soft for me and not the best on my back but some prefer them a bit softer. There was a flat screen TV and a desk and the bathroom was well stocked. The highlight of our stay was a wave runner tour of the island that we booked through Barefoot Billy's at the hotel. It was a 2 hour tour that covered around 30 miles around the island that was very fun and informative. There were a couple weddings at the hotel when we were there and it was a great setting for special events. The renovations of this historic hotel were impressive and the place sparkled. We were impressed. Overall, we really liked how this hotel gave us a \"resort\" feel that we wouldn't have gotten at a lot of the other hotels on the island.

There were a few rude staff members (one towel guy and one bartender in particular). I hate saying that because several staff members were very helpful and accommodating but one bad apple ruins the bushel! Drinks were small and watered down--definitely not worth the price. When I checked out, they tried to charge me $10.00 for a \"Casa Marina History book.\" I asked what in the world that was, and the guy was very vague and said it was a book in the room and if we took it we got charged for it, adn that housekeeping had reported it missing on the third day of our stay. I told him I had no idea what he was talking about, had never seen it, and if I went to the room and found it would he remove the charge? He removed it right then anyway, which makes me think there was no such book and they were trying to see how much they could get away with.

Mallory Square needs a cab, but who cares.... The property itself is first-rate. The common areas, the pools, the private beach, the outdoor restaurant and bar areas, the pier - there is just not one negative thing I could even dream to say about the resort overall. The beach service was excellent, with touches that make you know that you're @ a Waldorf property - fruit in the morning, drink of the day at noon, popsicles at 2pm, cold eucalyptus towels at 4pm. Simply first rate. Seriously. We were there June 11-17, super hot, amazing, hot, super sunny 100% of the time, and we could always could find a place on the beach, watch the boats go by, read, tan, stroll up to get lunch or fruit soaked water, and just enjoy the scenery. We made day trips to Islamorada for deep sea fishing (Seahorse Charters - 2 thumbs way up for any level novice to expert - we caught a ton of mahi and it was a fantastic experience with Cpt. Rick Rodriguez) and Marathon to the Dolphin Research Center, also super amazing to do the interactive swim with Pax our dolphin buddy. Otherwise spent all our time in and around the Casa and in town. The only reason that this stay didn't get 5 stars was the room. We had a standard room, #429, and it was just so-so. It was motel style, opening to the public outdoor area.

The service is great, but their attitude is even better. Every staff member greets you, which is amazing, since for years I was GM at a large resort and know how difficult that is to accomplish. My son called one day as I was lounging on the beach drinking a pina colada, and he said if I sounded any more relaxed, I'd need to be resuscitated. And while there, do yourself a favor and book a massage on the beach with Livia. It's expensive, but WOW, totally worth it.

The nicest beach and pool area in Key West \u00e2\u20ac\u201can island which has almost no beach except on Atlantic side. While not on top of Duval Street, it is walkable to it. A shout out to Mark, Will and Patrick at the pool. We have never had better attention or more pampering at a beach resort. All day, they keep on bringing out to everyone surprise \u00e2\u20ac\u0153treats\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd: ice water, drink of the day, popsicles, cool cucumbers for your eyes, chilled lotion, frozen scented wash cloths, cleaning your glasses and on and on! Amazing. Beautiful water and fabulous beach setting, very good food \u00e2\u20ac\u201c dine at Sun Sun with your feet in the sand and very nice breakfast. Beautiful lobby and beach, azure warm ocean - no waves due to coral reef. I was however, very disappointed with the room. I have no idea how they could have a four diamond rating from anyone \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the rooms are simply sub-par. Old bathroom with, weird stall shower with half glass (spotted and never cleaned), and half beige shower-curtain and sloppily patched broken tile floor , Everything looks shabby, beat, and soiled\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6..grimy swich plates, stains on the ceramic floor and furniture, they change the linens and mop the tile floor but not much else. I doubt the room is ever thoroughly cleaned and the d\u00c3\u00a9cor is light \u00e2\u20ac\u201c yes, but dismal and dull. I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t get how a cardboard box wrapped in dirty beige muslin is an attractive piece of wall art or lighting fixture. We paid quite a bit for an upgraded ocean view and saw nothing but the top of a palm tree \u00e2\u20ac\u201c so don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t bother. Also, skip the fourth floor \u00e2\u20ac\u201c third or second probably better \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the top floor has a higher cement barrier and obscures the view even more from your balcony. Separating our balcony from neighbors was more of the soiled beige muslin/canvas stuff they love in this place. Also \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the rooms do not all have interior corridors and your entry overlooks a roof and what looks like a prison courtyard. No effort at all made to obscure or dress this up even a little bit. The hallways in the rooms that do have interior corridors are dark, soiled carpet, and smell moldy, damp and musty. You do have to realize that this is an older historic property as the front desk explained \u00e2\u20ac\u201c but that has nothing to do with housekeeping or decorating. The elevator leading to our room always had dirt, food and spills on the floor and stained and rusted stainless steel doors. No one at the hotel seems to stay on top of this. They seem too busy doing other things. It seems that hotel management stresses the services at the pool which are stellar \u00e2\u20ac\u201c but no one pays attention to running a tight ship with housekeeping \u00e2\u20ac\u201c no one suggests tips to these people \u00e2\u20ac\u201c whereas tip suggestions to all the other staff are quite evident. Therefore, housekeeping people have no real incentive to do anything extra and have no role-models or standards to keep as I have come to expect in a four diamond property. We had just come from the Conrad hotel in Miami which is also a four diamond Waldorf Astoria property by Hilton \u00e2\u20ac\u201c that had a spotless and beautiful room and new marble baths plus shower. Two hotels, same chain, same rating, worlds of difference. We were told that the Casa Marina recently completed an 80 million renovation \u00e2\u20ac\u201c not sure where they spent it \u00e2\u20ac\u201c if it was on the hotel rooms , d\u00c3\u00a9cor \u00e2\u20ac\u201c they sure got ripped off. The status of the room condition and housekeeping is not likely to change much since they seem to be 100% occupied per the gentleman at the desk I complained to when I wanted a room change. They average seven weddings a week and have loads of business meetings and events hosted there which we observed. I am sure they make quite a bit of money from this. These events can actually feel a bit intrusive and even annoying,. On Sunday, when we were relaxing on the beach they started setting up buffet tables right in front of us at the ocean edge around the middle of the day. However, bottom line, if you want to stay in Key West and also want a beautiful and expansive ocean front and beach setting with lots of amenities \u00e2\u20ac\u201c this is really your only choice. The one other option might be to stay at the Reach \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the sister property about a block away (separated by another property). That is newer and PERHAPS rooms are nicer (you'd have to check that out)\u00e2\u20ac\u201c the guests of each property have priveleges at the other resort. In spite of my gripes about the room, I would likely return and overlook much because we loved the overall Key West experience\u00e2\u20ac\u201c it is a fun vacation and destination with lots of water sports, great snorkeling and many good restaurants. Oh look, there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a chicken! I did my own cleaning. Hopefully the management will hear these complaints and get someone in charge of housekeeping who CARES about it and add in a bit more sparkle and clean and elbow grease, scrub that floor and clean the shower glass daily and put in new baths, etc etc. One more thing - high speed or low speed internet did not work most of the time in our room.

There is no one thing that ruined our vacation and generally speaking, we had a nice time. I am not going to be one of these people that dings a hotel because the toilet paper wasn't folded into a triangle each morning. I am a Hilton Diamond member. I have traveled the world staying in hotels that range from hostels in Europe to bungalows in Tahiti. I know what to expect and I hold hotels to the standard that their brand and rates command. I don't expect a Motel 6 to have turndown service and I don't expect the Ritz to give me sandpaper towels. I think that is fair. I don't rate hotels poorly who don't upgrade me due to my status when their occupancy is at 100%. I am reasonable. That being said, there were several issues at this property that made our stay mediocre given the cost and branding of the property. Let's start with the good. Mick and Max at the pool were excellent. If I were a bean counter, I would continue to enhance your offerings with the pool concierge. It is the one service that is truly 4, almost 5 star. Also, the rooms and decor, while small, are quite functional and pleasant. The showers were luxurious while not large and the lotions and potions were spot on for a 4 star experience. Now for the not so good. 1) Bar and food service at the pool is AWFUL. It was nearly impossible to flag down a waitress. During the one occasion we did, the waitress completely forgot my wife's order. When she finally came back, she brought a virgin. When she went back again, she brout the wrong drink. On the fourth attempt, the drink was correct, however, the alcohol was nearly absent. I have absolutely no problem paying $9 for a drink on the beach at a nice resort; however, at least serve it correctly, with a smile, and the appropriate amount of alcohol. 2) Housekeeping was completely sporadic. While rooms were always clean, during turndown service, towels were seldom replaced and the shower gel and shampoo were never replaced despite having empty bottles. When towels were replaced, we received pool towels and we were able to get shower gel the one night we bumped into housekeeping during turndown. THIS IS UNACCEPTABLE for even a 3 star resort. If you are going to offer a turndown service and freshen the room, then do that. Don't skimp on stupid items like fresh toiletries and towels. I would rather reuse the nicer bathroom towels than use a lotion filled pool towel that resembles sandpaper. This is either cheap, lazy, or both and management should take note. Remember, this is a beach hotel and guest will take showers twice a day. The hotel should be able to accommodate. 3) Concierge and front desk staff were indifferent. No one was particularly helpful or caring and service was often cold. One morning, I approached the concierge to pre purchase a ticket to the Hemingway house. She indicated that the hotel did not sell these. When I asked if she could assist me with booking through their site and printing the tickets, she directed me to the business center. At the business center, the cost to use the Internet for ten minutes and print two tickets to the Hemingway house would have run $10.50. Am I missing something here? A concierge should be able to provide this service free of charge. It is almost an insualt to send a guest to the business lounge at a resort of this caliber when a full service concierge is on staff. In closing, I hope I have provided some meaningful feedback to others who may be looking at this resort. It is a wonderful building with comfortable rooms and decor. However, this resort falls way short of its reputation as a Waldorf property. I cannot point to the actual cause of the problem, but I would start with resort management. Whether misguided by accountants counting pennies in a back office or poor training for the workforce there is room for improvement. They may be able to charge $300 a night in the short term, but the long term success of this property will require some leadership.", "Date": "June 6, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Key West, Florida", "Title": "\u201ccustomer service at pool site\u201d", "Author": "Aubrey34345", "ReviewID": "UR111893011", "Content": "I want to think Mark, Jake, Max, they gave us the best custmer serve to me and my family.

Concierge , valet parking and bell boy service excellent . Incidentally valet parking was $20 and self parking across the street in a secure lot was $15. There are 2 large pools in the lush gardens and the wide ,palm tree lined beach is at the end of the white marble deck . Between the crystal clear waves and the cream coloured sand is a small flat rocky area ,typical of Key West but access to the water is provided by a large wooden jetty and steps . We swam alot in the ocean and the jetty was well used . Service around the pool area is efficient and the pool bar made great cocktails and served cold beer . Although the hotel is 5 star and in the Waldorf chain, prices on drinks,snacks and rooms were reasonable .Some of the beach and pool services were ,to say the least indulgent . The pool attendants would bring you drinks,food, lay your beach towels on your bed for you ,along with cleaning your sunglasses and spraying you with cool water . Popsicles and cool water drinks every hour . On the edge of the sandy beach is a large hut with waverunners ,small sail boats & scooters for hire . We rented bicycles & $15 a day as Key West is very cycle friendly . We thoroughly enjoyed our stay at the Casa , the town of Key west is only 10 minutes walk through leafy ,palm tree lined avenues .It has fabulous nightlife , restaurants ,architecture and scenery .Most of the entertainment is on Duval Street. For great gourmet food try Mangoes & New York Pasta Garden . For cold beer ,fries ,big burgers & great live music go to Sloppy Joes Cowboy Bills & Jack Flats .

The walls are quite thin, therefore, sleeping wasn't great as you could hear every little noise. A few other areas of opportunity were the times at which they cleaned the facilities. I understand they need to stay on top of cleaning for obvious reasons but we were constantly having to get out of the way of housekeeping. From sweeping the lobby floors to vacuuming the halls, I've just never seen so much going on under the guests feet before when traveling. I also felt there should always be complimentary tea/coffee for guests in the hotel lobby like most other hotels offer....having to pay for Starbucks coffee every morning in their gift shop was beyond crazy to me when you are already paying such high rates for a nice hotel. They had these small espresso/keurig type of pots in the rooms but the coffee out of them was awful so we had to pay for Starbucks coffee which we don't even like. The last thing which was quite upsetting was the number of outsiders coming in to use the facilities when they weren't even staying at the hotel. They came by the carloads and when we were the ones paying the high prices to stay at this luxury resort, we somedays couldn't even get seats by the pool, drink service, towel service. There should be some sort of security to minimize this abuse and it would have been quite easy to take care of it as those people were loudly bragging about what they had done to everyone around them. This happened on multiple occasions throughout our 5 day stay. Now, with all of those suggestions, the one thing I can't say enough positive things about was the pool side service...most especially, our pool side concierge, Max. He went out of his way to make us comfortable and meet our every need and ALWAYS with a huge smile!

Overall we found it to be an excellent resort. The Awesome: -The grounds. It looks like something out of a movie. Just beautiful. Palm trees, sand, outdoor dining, really makes you feel like you're on vacation. -The staff. Everyone was very friendly while getting you what you need ASAP, be it beach chairs, a cab, a drink or an excursion. -The pools. They have two medium sized pools that never got crowded and were kept very warm, probably 85 degrees or more. -On site dining and bar. They had good, sweet, tropical drinks. In particular, my girlfriend thought her Key Lime Pina Colada was the best Pina Colada she had. The dinner there was very good and the lunch was fantastic (yellowtail fish n' chips). The Good: -Location. Very close to Southernmost point and a couple of restaurants. It's a 30 minute walk to the bustling parts of Duval street and closer to 45 to get to the marina area where you'll catch most snorkel/scuba/sailing trips. That was not a problem for us but it might be a bit far for some people. Cabs are almost always waiting outside the hotel and it was $11, including tip, to get to the marina. -The beach. It's not huge but it's private to the resort and felt pretty spacious. There is a strip of coral rock in between the sand and the ocean so don't expect to be in and out of the water very much. Really, if you are looking for a purely beach-centric vacation Key West is not the best place. It doesn't have the massive strip of sand you get in Miami beach or Virginia Beach and main part of town is on the opposite side of the island from the public beaches. The so-so: -Our room. We stayed in a Flagler Ocean Vista room. It was spacious and nicely appointed. It did have a wide ocean view but you couldn't see out the window from most of the room, there was no deck, and the window itself was painted shut. If you are dead set on an ocean view it is worth getting one of the rooms in the newer part of the hotel (NOT the Flagler building). A couple quirks included no bathroom fan or rack for a hand towel. The TV was small relative to the size of the room but it never got turned on so that wasn't a big deal. -The hallways have dated, mustard yellow and brown carpet. It might look good at a southwestern themed hotel in Taos or Santa Fe but it was a noticeable downgrade from both the room and lobby appointments.

Off to a rocky start, the first room we were assigned was an implausible journey ( one of us is disabled) that didn't make any sense at all. The second, assigned by a friendly young woman at the front desk, had a view of a generator and a rooftop and was unfathomably miniscule for 2 people. The third, assigned by an apologetic man, was facing the front of the hotel parking circle, not a bad location, actually, as it was peaceful and the vegetation is lovely. My main complaint about the room is the teeny-tiny bathroom that does not have a door that seals. It has a double door arrangement, like window shutters, which, if you are traveling with anyone, affords no privacy whatsoever and if you don't want to have to listen to the private ablutions of your tripmate, you are stuck. I don't know about you, but bathroom privacy, especially when you are traveling with a friend is important. I mean you are not in a bathroom-intimacy relationship type of thing, so a double bedded room with virtually non-existent door is undesirable. For that reason I would not return to Casa Marina with a friend.It's not an appealing setup. And I would even ask if in a kingbedded room ( if traveling with a significant other) whether there is a real door to the bathroom.) Speaking of doors, I could not open the door from the inside due to the intensity of the hydraulic seal combined with the heaviness of the door. If you are a petite woman who is not buff, or has some sort of physical challenge, this would be challenging. They sent a workman to adjust it. which then made it requisite that we ensure the door would shut fully behind us, and that whole process ate up at least 30 minutes. Combined with the room assignments being initially problematic, check in was a time bandit. On the bright side, the grounds are beautiful. 2 pools. If one is filled with noisy kids, you can go to the other one.As usual, smoking around the pool is irritating if you are allergic or asthmatic,and it may be a workable idea for them to designate one pool a smoking area and the other pool smokefree. But the smoking issue is a serious factor in a trip to Key West , we discovered. This is \"land of smokers\", evidently and at every Key West location, it is almost shocking to see the ashtrays in the 21st century. We got into a taxi that REEKED of cig smoke. The driver was a smoker and everyone is seemingly indifferent to secondhand smoke. The resort on the inside, however, is smokefree.But in a location where tie dye never went out of style, it makes sense that smoking is still the norm. You might want to consider this before planning a trip to Key West, especially if you want to go into the town. It's worse than NYC, smokewise. The staff at Casa Marina were mostly very friendly, with the exception of a disinterested breakfast waiter. Which raises the topic of food. This is not a resort that you want to eat meals at----as has previously been mentioned in other reviews. The food is absolutely awful. After one inedible lunch only eaten because we had eaten all day, and that breakfast, we passed on dinners , or repeating the experience. The food is slung unto a plate of some sort, boring, tasteless, go someplace else. Surprisingly good is their miniature Spa. Heather is a phenomenal Reflexologist. You have to at least try the short appt. Amazing! A very no-nonsense facialist did extractions that , while taking a week to recover fully from the work, has restored the problem area on my skin. Their lobby is exquisite at this resort and just walking through it lends an air of a bygone era of stately elegance and spacious beauty that is worth the stay. Take the Hemingway house tour. ( By the way--- to the review who criticized the property for not \"draining the pool\" after an incident with a toddler. You do not \"drain\" a pool for that. You \" shock\" it with chlorine. You would not know when and whether they had done so, but I feel certain they must have because it is standard practice and a regulation.)", "Date": "May 24, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Dallas, Texas", "Title": "\u201cOutstanding service in an idyllic setting.\u201d", "Author": "PecosBill21", "ReviewID": "UR109636057", "Content": "this was an unplanned trip with no reservations.

The Casa is a restored hotel and in it is a lot of history. The rooms are clean and elegant and the housekeeping staff very good. The Jet Ski tour with Thomas was a highlight. Highly recommend making sure this is on your to do list. The only draw back or a plus depending on your view point is that you have a bit of a walk to get to Duval and the more action packed activities. We ventured out each morning for a brisk walk of about a 1-2 miles before selecting our location for breakfast. That is something we enjoy so not being in the middle of the Duval scene was a plus for us.

Water was calm as usual (there are no waves because of the reefs 7 miles outside of Key West). Pools and beach are perfect. The service was excellent.

But Brandon was very concerned that the only rooms he had available had double queen beds, and not king beds (my wife and I were traveling over our anniversary). Not only was the room he gave us in the main building lovely, it had a good sized outdoor balcony overlooking the grounds and ocean. The next morning a larger room became available, but because of our balcony and view my wife and I elected to stay put. Brandon was so generous and gracious in a most unnecessary way feeling we somehow needed to be compensated for our inconvenience. During our stay, we were so impressed with the staff. Friendly, courteous, caring, and most importantly treating us like valued guests truly impressed us. We had such a delightful time and much of it was a direct result of the high standards held by the staff. In my job, I am on the road 186 days a year. Nothing insults me more as a Diamond Member than being treated like some schlub off the street, and unfortunately it happens more often than it should.

The rooms are not lavishly appointed, but are that Euro-clean aesthetic look. It's not everyone's cup of tea, I know. The beach has a small area that is directly into the water from the sand, otherwise, it's over the coral-rock or off the pier. This is not unusual in the Key's. When booking a room, the resort fees are clearly outlined. The prices may not be cheap, but good God - you're at a resort in an expensive vacation place to begin with! BTW, the cold buffet which included an array of smoked salmon, sliced cold meats and cheeses, berry tarts, and yogurt parfaits in addition to the usual fruits, cereals, breads, and danish was only $15.00 per per person which included juice and coffee.

I know things like this happened but it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the staff\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s job to make sure the correct charges are being made to the correct rooms. We made the fatal mistake of leaving an opened Capri Sun on the counter in the ice bucket over night. We woke up to ants covering the entire corner of the TV table. We couldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t throw anything with left over food residue in the trash cans inside the room because ants would swarm it within an hour. Even when food wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t around we still had the ant problem the entire stay. The food at this place was very mediocre for a 5star place. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve went to buffets that served better quality of food than this resort. I ordered Calamari that taste like I was chewing on rubber bands. The breakfast buffet was just ok but the price turned us off. $52 every morning for both of us to eat breakfast is just ridicules. I ordered Fish and Chips from their over priced, very limited menu on Sunday the 8th . As I was eating it, I noticed the fish was halfway un-cooked in the middle. I got very sick on Monday morning the 7th and had to sleep the entire day. Now I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m reading different reviews and thinking back on the dates. I see another review said that some one pooped in the pool on Saturday the 7th and the staff didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t drain the pool. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s nasty!!! Now, I can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t tell if my sickness came from the un-cooked fish that I ate on Sunday the 8th OR from the possibility of contracting E-Coli due to the hotel staff not draining the contaminated pool on Saturday the 7th. In which I did get into that same west pool on both days, not knowing about the poop incident before hand. Again \u00e2\u20ac\u0153That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s some nasty ish\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. I feel sick to my stomach just thinking about it again! Drinks were very expensive and some of the bartender had sucky attitudes. They charge $9 for a Pina Colada and had nerve to put it in a little plastic cup. You would think that a $9 drink would be served in a high glass for that price. Service Walls are very thin and hollow and the hotel hall way carpet was dingy. It has a very bad beach location. I mean I know it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a man made beach but geesh, the beach had slimy rocks at the edge and you couldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t walk directly into the water. You had to walk onto a pier to get into the water. They only had one little section of the water that didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have rocks and that was on the end where the Jet ski rentals were. We had a 1 bedroom partial ocean view suite with a balcony. I can surely tell you that the view sucked, it was all covered up by palm trees as we were on the 3rd floor. I had to peak around the banister to see the ocean. Was suppose to get free breakfast on Friday for the rest of our stay due to the ants but the guy who promised us had left didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t leave a note in compensation of our ant problem. He didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t come back until Sunday and the other hotel staff would not honor his promise unless they first talked to him as if we were lying. Every day when we left the resort I would become happy and content with my surroundings. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s how much negative energy this resort gave off to me. Every bad experience we had during our entire honeymoon was on this hotel premises.

Graham at the pool was helpful, friendly and delightful! The other concierges, including Adam, Max and John, were also great. Robin, the bartender at the pool bar, was fabulous! We really enjoyed the grounds and pool. The hotel- not so much. First off, we were staying here on Hilton Honors points. Generally Hilton treats their guests that are using points very well when providing rooms. I have been a diamond member for years. Not the case here. When we checked in they tried to give us a terrible handicap-accessible room that looked worn-down and dirty. It was terribly shaped with no way to even watch the TV (not that you're there to watch TV, but come on!) and had a shower that was basically just a drain in the floor with a shower seat and a flimsy curtain. If I was in need of a handicap room and I was put in that I would be offended. I do not appreciate being treated like a bother when I use the points that I have literally spent tens of thousands of dollars at Hilton-brand hotels to acquire. When we requested a new room they did move us, but to a barely better room, overlooking a parking lot and street with no balcony. Not impressive at all and certainly not Waldorf quality. The rooms are bland and worn-out feeling. Do not expect luxury. In addition, the walls are paper thin and you can hear absolutely everything, particularly from the hall-way. Do not expect to sleep past 7:00ish when loud people and kids hit the hallways. Other than the pool area and breakfast one morning, I was not impressed with the overall service. It just seems like a factory. Not at all personal, helpful or enthusiastic. Food was OK- we only had breakfast and one lunch. Breakfast service on the terrace was lovely thanks to our fabulous server Jozef. Bottom-line- the grounds and beach/pool are great, hotel not so great. There are so many great places in Key West to stay, don't think I would waste my money here, especially if you end up in a sub-par room like we received.

Our 2 bedroom suite was so run down, the furniture looked 30 years old and the couch in the main sitting room was old and and uncomfortable and extremely dirty. There were marks of some sort on the cushions as well as the arm rests. IT WAS DISGUSTING!!! The bathrooms had no counter space and terrible water pressure. Also there is no turn down service, the maid only services the room once per day. Our cable tv upstairs in our bedroom did not work when we arrived and only fixed it our second day there. The worst part of the trip was the room service. It was one of the worst I've ever experienced and we tried to order different things over our 5 days.

They brought me 3 full breakfasts, charged me extra $10.00 for an english muffin which hadn't been toasted. They tried correcting the bill twice, finally to charge me for 2 breakfasts and the english muffin because each additional egg is $5.00 !!!! I think they've lost their mind! The buffalo wings and salads had so much dressing they were inedible. Oh and the best part is the delivery guy who brought our room service on Friday night looked like he crawled out from working on the air conditioning unit.

We had a pool/ocean view suite on the 2nd floor. The room was large and well appointed. We like having a mini fridge in the room for our sodas and snacks. We had no issues with the housekeeping. Our room was designed to be an adjoining room, and as such, we could hear everything going on in the room next to us. Including the spat the couple was having late into the night. A quick phone call to their room number explaining that we could hear the was the end of that issue. This is grand old dam of a hotel. The architecture and surroundings are magnificent. You will not get a huge bathroom, but you will get mature landscaping with palm trees and quiet, serene surroundings. If you're looking for a 'state of the art' modern hotel - then you need to look elsewhere and let someone who enjoys quiet, stately sophistication have the room. As others have noted here, the beach staff is phenomenal. Kudos and a shout out to Max on the beach. Couldn't ask for a nicer guy - anywhere. Mark - who is large and in charge - is great as well. They truly made our stay at the Casa Marina an outstanding experience. Unfortunately, I can't say the same thing for the guys at the bike rental shack - even though they are managed by Mark and are part of the same group as those on the beach, these guys all seem to have a terrible, \"can't be bothered if you're not going on a wave runner tour\" attitude. The word 'snotty' comes to mind. Rent your bikes off-site. There are PLENTY of bike rental companies that will deliver your bikes to the resort, and charge you LESS than the Casa Marina. More problems with renting our bikes than I can detail here. Tip - Get the best price you can on Priceline for the hotel (4 star Key West) and then upgrade to the Ocean Vista suite for $40/night when you get there. Tip - Ditch your car and rent a bike. The Old Town area of Key West is an EASY 10 minute bike ride from Casa Marina. The whole island of Key West is one big bike path. Parking in old town and anywhere close to Mallory Square is a nightmare - but there are bike racks everywhere. I am almost 50 years old, out of shape and have bad knees, and I thoroughly enjoyed the bike.

Probably not and overall we had a great time.\u201d", "Author": "SusieBella", "ReviewID": "UR106559898", "Content": "I have to say I was a bit disappointed in the hotel, wanted to love it. Yes, this is a great location (removed but not remote ) with lovely grounds and a nice beach but overall the staff is just not that friendly. I read the reviews ahead of time and this seemed to be a pretty common refrain. I figured we are self sufficient adults and we don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t need or seek to be fawned over, so I was not deterred. Pleasant should be the baseline personality to work at a resort, sadly, I would give this property a 50/50 ratio of nice to surly. As to the room, we loved our ocean front suite. The rooms are a bit austere, restyled modern is accurate. Note the shutters from the bedroom into the courtyard let in a surprising amount of light if you are a light sleeper this will be bothersome. While we were very happy to have an early arrival accommodated by Patrick (he was pleasant), unfortunately the room hadn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t been fully serviced by housekeeping. By that I mean a dirty robe hanging in the closet obviously inside out and the first two towels I reached for had long black streaks on them. Not a good start, then somewhere during our stay the bath mat went missing, not a big deal. This was all remedied promptly but it did leave me with a very uneasy feeling and it is definitely not appropriate for a Waldorf property. Irritation was quickly dispelled by the very accommodating and cheerful beach side service from the fellas at H2O. Graham was outstanding over the course of our 5 day stay, as were Adam and Jon... very helpful with or without cash on hand to tip. We actually moved several times one particular day to avoid cigarettes and then naughty children and there wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t a bit of resistance just that cheerful service while we got resituated on the beach at the far, far, far end. As others have mentioned the drink of the day, ice pops and frozen towelettes are a nice touch. Unfortunately this service was not uniform. The wait staff at the beach are pretty inept \u00e2\u20ac\u201c we didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t really expect prompt service on the beach since it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s our choice not to amble up to the bar but we do expect napkins, utensils and condiments when we finally get our lunch, otherwise we are taking our lazy butts up to the restaurant to fetch them (2nd trip since the 1st was usually in search of a server). Did my husband chide me for tipping anyway \u00e2\u20ac\u201c of course! At breakfast the wait staff, Darren and Eloise our hostess, were lovely. The rest of them I could do without -the woman at the sundries shop was downright surly, anyone can have a bad day \u00e2\u20ac\u201c she had several. The folks at the concierge were fine, not pleasant, but not rude \u00e2\u20ac\u201c interestingly neutral. Maybe they are not all suited for a job that entails answering dumb tourist questions over and over, day in, day out \u00e2\u20ac\u201c I wouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t want to do it either. Lastly, at checkout our bill didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t accurately reflect the resort credits we were due with our package or the breakfast option we purchased for a variance of about $300. Check your bill carefully! Nit picking you may say - I think not when it comes to housekeeping or billing errors but I will grant you the rest. However, when you are staying 5 nights in a suite that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s quite pricey you expect standards to be met consistently as befitting the Waldorf flag. Is there a better property on Key West? Probably not and overall we had a great time. Room for improvement for a hotel that advertises timeless luxury and service? Most definitely.

The ceilings are so low that my husband, who is under 6 ft, hit his hand on it when changing. And to top it all off, there is mildew in the shower. The floors in the bedroom itself just look dirty and worn as does the patio furniture. The walls are paper thin so you can hear everything going on in the rooms next to you and in the hallway. Having said all that, the common spaces of the hotel are beautiful and poolside service is okay. The lunch served poolside was disgusting ( how do you mess up a blt and Cobb salad?).

The Casa Marina is a property that has it all -- and thats not always a good thing. First lets start with the location -- its a decent but not great location -- the sister property \"The Reach\" seems to have a much better location for quick walks off property to eat and explore. The views from the lobby to the pools and beach is nearly perfect at the Casa. The Casa Marina has two pretty decent sized pools -- and while the property was a capacity during our stay, the pool areas were full but not crowded as most people did a pretty good job of spreading around the property. A word of caution about the beach -- it is a coral and grass beach which means that for the most part if you want to swim in the ocean you need to use the pier that is built out over the coral to get to deeper water to swim. This is the only real downside about the beach and had we known this (or had a done a better job reading the reviews) I would have stayed at \"The Reach\" Onto the rooms. We were upgraded to an ocean view suite in the main (read older) building. We had a corner room with an ocean \"view' (the palm trees at the Casa are mature and tall -- so they obstruct some of the view). The room was large with wooden floors -- and more than a little dirty. Now that we travel with a toddler its a little more important to have clean floors :-) We asked and the housekeeping staff cleaned the floors again and we didn't have to ever ask again. No problems with towels and such. The Carpets in the main building are a little worn -- but at a hotel that sits on the beach with no foot wash coming off the sand -- dirty worn carpet will happen. I'd like to see them take some time to re-think the furniture in these rooms... luckily the suite had more floor space but in a regular room it looked cramped. The service was either fantastic (front desk, concierge, H20 concierge) or HORRIBLE (Sun Sun wait staff, breakfast wait staff) since we were traveling with our little guy, we decided to eat our Breakfast and Lunch on property (we don't normally do this at hotels). Once you get past the fact that you are going to be robbed (which is the norm at most hotel settings) you at least hope that your going to 1) get good service or 2) get good food On both accounts the Casa pretty much failed us. Waits for food (after ordering) were sometimes as long as an hour -- once it took me 60 minutes just to pay the bill -- yeah the thought crossed my mind too -- just leave. Breakfast buffet is average -- but drinks are handled by the wait staff -- getting an OJ or water refill was nearly impossible. I admit that my wife and I are spoiled by our stays at truly high-end properties where they get 99% of everything right 99% of the time.

A monotone, can I get you anything else? Is really more of the Lurch tone from the Addams family. The housekeeping is astoundingly poor: sometimes I get a bathroom rug and other days they take it. I'm not sure what they do with it, give it to someone else for awhile, or maybe I left too many towels on the floor and now I am penalized. I actually sat in the room while it was being cleaned when the housekeeper said she had no more pillowcases....my response? You can get more, right? She said she wasn't sure. I asked her to check, and voil\u00c3\u00a0, they had more. I have had an empty Kleenex box for 3 days. They actually left a plate of food, that was clearly done being consumed, and penalized me by giving me no washcloths...I still have the bath rug today, not sure what gives there.

I studied Waldorf in school for Hospitality business and this property goes against every standard they have. There are 2 exceptions, the beach/pool staff and the valet staff.

We repeatedly asked for an upgraded room but none were made available to us. 5. The room itself was minimal at best and not worth the price paid wether in $$ or 60,000 HHonors points per night.

The 2 Zacks and Niko were attentive and engaging . The only negative is that the pools were not heated...They were a little on the chilly side for early March. We had a basic island view room which was fine. A little on the small side but nicely appointed. Service was good, not great. Housekeeping was good, not great. My biggest complaint was that room service dishes were in the hallway from late at night until mid afternoon the next day. Maybe this is a little ticky tack but it is something that shouldn't happen at a nice resort. The workout room was really good.. nice equipment and very clean. This is a really good resort. However, this is not a 4 seasons, ritz carlton, or the Breakers kind of hotel. It is really a Key West resort... kind of casual but very nice. While on the island this trip we spent time at the Hyatt and Westin on the other side of the island...

It had unmuffled Harley Davison motorcycle parking next to the window and shared a wall with the pool's women's restroom. I shudder to think what room we would have been given without my Diamond status.... The property needs a lot of work, both physical and mental. The hall carpet needs to be replaced; the shower curtain in our room was moldy; the tv was tiny and ancient. There was a major disconnect between between the front desk staff and the housekeepers on several issues. On most days room service \"remains\" were visible throughout the hotel for hours. Curiously, although the room had stationary, it did not have either a pen or pad for notes! The pluses- The location is great. We did not rent a car and walked everywhere. It was an easy 30 minute walk to the end of Duval and Simonton. Next, Mark and his staff at the pool and beach were phenomenal! Jon, Matt and the two Zacks provided excellent,personalized customer service. These guys are an great source of local info and we found their advice on point. We dined at Salute, El Siboney, Louies, Alonzo's and The Conch Republic based on their insights. This team is a gem and would be the only reason we might return.

Let me start by saying that the pools, beaches and facilities were on point. The staff was friendly extremely friendly and helpful. We liked that the hotel wasn't right on the main drag (we stayed during spring break and are past our college days) so we had a reprieve from the madness that is Duval Street. You are definitely walking distance to Old Town which was nice but be aware that they do charge you to park at the hotel ($15/ day self park, $20/day for valet). The best part of our stay was our Waverunner Tour with Kris from Barefoot Billy's which is right on the grounds. He was FANTASTIC! This was one of the best parts about our stay at Casa Marina so if you stay there be sure not to miss it. If you mention the barefootbillys.com discount you will get $10 off too. The only downside to this hotel was that the rooms were a major letdown. For $400/night at a Waldorf Hotel you expect luxury and extravagance, but that is not how I would describe the wing of the hotel we stayed in. When you walk into the main lobby the rooms in that portion of the hotel look like they are really nice, but since that is not where our room was I can only assume. We had to hike around to a side wing of the hotel which is serviced by a separate elevator. The exterior looked like it needed a really good powerwashing and once we got to our actual room there was dingy carpeting that smelled musty in the hallway. Our room was decently clean looking, the beds were immaculate - which is the most important thing to me - but the furniture and fixtures looked like they had seen better days. The shower curtain was icky and needed to be replaced. We called and complained and they removed the resort tax for the first night (about $25) and offered to send up the housekeeping director. This was an improvement but still frustrating for the amount of $ we were paying to stay there. I cannot however reiterate how amazing the staff was at this hotel. Everyone was incredibly friendly and helpful. We particularly liked Joe from the bellhop service and Patrick from the pool bar. Everyone at barefoot billy's was really great too. All in all, the Casa Marina would have gotten an A+ in my book if it had been a $200/night hotel but since it was so costly, I can only give it a C-. If you are used to staying in luxury resorts, you will have to readjust your expectations or this is not the place for you.", "Date": "March 11, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cKey West Best Resort and Service\u201d", "Author": "Bjluther52", "ReviewID": "UR99715146", "Content": "One word \"AWESOME\" Great location with a great private beach.

There are two nice sized pools, and a great beach with hammocks, beach games and plenty of attentive concierge staff to set up umbrellas and chaise lounges. The service is excellent.

I didn't complain even though the bathroom was musty smelling because the suite was large and a number of reviews complained about size. The bellboy was very friendly. Breakfast was eaten outdoors overlooking the ocean. It's the view you're paying for definitely - just gorgeous. We had the breakfast buffet which was delicious and varied. The waitstaff was unexceptional though - a little slow and one girl even snapped at us when we asked about the status of our pancakes. I think they are interns for thte most part and still learning customer service. We didn't spend much time in the room or even on the beach or at the pool. We spent our time taking in all the sites of Key West. The one time my daughter asked someone to set up a chair and an umbrella for her (she's 16) she was told you have to make a reservation for that service. What??! With the money we paid for a resort fee?? We didn't eat lunch or dinner at the hotel. We did lay on the beach for an hour one afternoon. Matt was extremely accomodating - the only staff member who was notable. The concierges were helpful but as to be expected for a \"five star hotel\". Overall, the Casa Marina is nice. It's upscale and classy - no screaming , wild kids or barrage of explatives which I heard on the streets. If you're looking for a private beach with hammocks and lawn chair service, this is the place for you. I didn't swim because the water was too cold but the pools were clean and beautiful.

The grounds of the property are fantastic and the jet ski trip around the island organized by hotel was great. Now let me list a few of the things that all seemed little at the time, but added up during the week. 1. I had sent e-mail prior to our arrival advising of an early arrival, when we arrived the room was not ready. This was ok because we needed lunch. We ate at the pool bar and waited for the room, over the next few hours we went back to the desk to inquire and were told they would call when the room was ready. Finally after returning to the desk we were advised the room was ready. (the NEXT day a message was left on my phone advising me that my room was ready) 2. Arrival to the room found minimal space for storage, no dressers so if you want to hang everything or live out of a suitcase this will not be an issue. 3. Issue with the toilet overflowing once and also running with a slow drip that lasted the week was corrected by keeping bathroom door closed. We were told by hotel staff that some of the toilets since the remodel have had issues they cannot figure out the cause. 4. Water and shampoo were not stocked daily and at one point we called down for replacement shampoo which arrived one hour later, water was requested one evening at 10:00PM and arrived at 1115AM the next day. 5. In accurate billing of room charges is still in the progress of correction. If you like tennis the PUBLIC courts are a one minute walk from entrance. If you want to rent a scooter for the week, as we did use a local company A&M charges were about 200.00 per week versus 80.00 per day at hotel. The Casa Marina just missed on what we expected from a Waldorf property. There were very little diamond privliges as seen at other hotels. ie: Breakfast coupons. Executive lounge. Diamond check in with staff willing to pass along property information. Even a request for late checkout or access to shower prior to leaving for airport was denied due to no spa or fitness center with shower's. Turn down service was hit and miss maybe 50% and some of the times a treat was left sometimes not. We had one room from 2/3/2011-2/10/2011 and one room with friends from 2/4/2011-2/7/2011.

Physically it is absolutely gorgeous, located on a beautiful beach,two swimming pools and a beach staff that doesn't go the extra mile, it goes about 3 miles. But, we made two moves to get the right room. When we arrived the room we requested was not available. This was at 5pm. At 11pm two rooms later(both unacceptable), my original request was granted and I had a large choice of rooms. Don't get it. The rooms are quirky, with no bureaus and one of the rooms had the closet in the bathroom. There were several complaints about dirty rooms altho ours was not. Many of us noted the showers flooded the bathroom, including our room. But sitting on the balcony and watching the sunset made it worthwhile. Only ate one breakfast at the hotel and chose the buffet. It was fine and I thought reasonably priced. I found the wait staff to be on Caribbean time. Getting coffee at breakfast a challenge. The bar was beautifully located but I had a difficult time getting a drink. Not just one night but every night. But then along comes Mark and the beach staff. Literally perfection. They were always there to help you and make the hotel look like the luxury hotel it was supposed to be. Not only were they there with popsicles, frozen towels, drinks and water sprays but they constantly watched the pool to take care of all needs. Mark discovered it was my wife's birthday. After determining my wife enjoyed the recognition of her birthday, Mark alerted everyone at the pool there would be a rendition of Happy Birthday. Mark slipped a balloon on her carry bag and then led the singing. he put balloons on her chair and bought her a round of drinks. In short they made her feel special (which she is). They heard people say \"i wish...\" and they went out of their way to do it. If the entire staff was like the beach staff I could recommend the hotel, even with their flawed rooms, but at their prices I just can't do it.

Elegantly renovated to chic standards, there is a lovely style standard being upkept, however, in our suite there was a strong and lingering musty odor that was not \"freshened\" until the day we departed and it did detract. Food service was average for a hotel of this category. We did some outdoor dining and were quite cold due to the failure of the staff to keep adequate space heaters running continuously. We enjoyed the breakfast buffet and the snack bar and found the food nicely prepared. The waiters were a little slower than one would hope, displaying a little too much \"island time\" mentality. This was a girls retreat weekend, and OVERALL, we had an amazing time. The highlights were certainly to be found on the sand. Especially HIGH MARKS to the towel attendants, Jon & Matthew. These awesome gentlemen were not only helpful, gracious and gregarious, they were able to overcome what some of their counterparts overlooked. Matthew went the extra mile by climbing a tree to raise a fallen hammock for one of us, while Jon chased away gulls and generally entertained us at every turn. There can be a fine line between overly solicitous even flirtatious attention, but these guys were purely and genuinely friendly without agenda. They made our two days of beach time fun, lively and memorable as well as comfortable. We enjoyed the free tastings offered as \"Drink of the Day\" but later found the bar service on the beach to be erratic at best. Concierge went the extra mile to get us great reservations at a local restaurant in town. Maid service was wholly unpredictable and had to be managed, which is not something we had expected at such a highly rated resort. We unfoturnately had occasion to interact with the Security Staff, and while the incident was unsettling, loud, violent argument between men in a nearby room, we found the Security Team to be of the utmost in professionalism and courtesy and they calmed our fears to mild trepidation. Sadly, there was no way around the disrupted sleep and that was a precious commodity for these moms on vacation from obligations for whom beauty rest is golden. Would we try again...? Certainly.

However, having read those reviews made me pay particular attention to the condition of the hotel, the cleanliness of our room, the service provided by the staff, etc.. I am writing my own review to emphasize that my husband and I could not have been more impressed with the Casa marina. We got to the hotel a bit early on our arrival date, and the staff quickly made sure that they found us an ocean view room, as we had been promised. The room was in excellent condition, extremely clean and well-appointed, and we had a lovely view of the pool area and the beach. Immediately after our arrival one of the staff came to our room, checking to make sure that everything was satisfactory, which it definitely was. Later on, before dinner, I was trying to check out the available in-room movies. I noticed that there was a problem accessing them. On our way to dinner I mentioned to a staff member at the front desk about the problem. A little while later, when we returned to our room, there were already two technicians there addressing the issue. They couldn't have been nicer! They even helped me to get on-line with my laptop. We ate breakfast and lunch at the hotel several times. Our food was very well prepared, and the service was great. In addition, the service at the pool and on the beach was amazing! Daily complimentary drinks of the day, ice water, and popsicles, as well as anything else we asked for were delivered to our chairs almost immediately. The entire bar / pool / beach area staff was fabulous, especially Matthew and Jon, who were absolutely terrific. Thanks so much, you two!

My husband and I absolutely love Key West...we got engaged there 4 years ago and decided to take a second honeymoon back to the island. My husband did quite a bit a research and since we are Gold VIP Hilton Honors members - we ended up at the Casa Marina Waldorf Astoria. We had put in our request for an ocean front upon booking and also reminded them when we checked in. Once we got into the room, we quickly realized that we actually had a view of the roof and giant fans directly outside each of our windows. We called down to the front desk and let them know that this is not what we had requested and to change our room...this was at 2pm on Day 1. I had to call back 3x\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s times to find out if they were able to find us another room. Maria (the hotel Manager) finally told us that there was no way they could move our room until the next morning. She asked me to call at that time for an update. We were a little disappointed, but we thought it would be worth the wait. The next morning, I called at 9am and they did not have a room for us. I called again at noon and then again at 3pm - nothing. It was not until 5pm that they were able to find another room for us. We had dinner reservations at 6pm, so we were in a rush to get ready. As soon as we moved rooms, my husband jumped in the shower to start getting ready. Within 10 minutes, I noticed water gushing out of the bathroom door into the main area of the room. The drain was backing up and our room was flooding. I quickly called the front desk and they waited about an hour to transfer us to another room - needless to say we cancelled our dinner reservations. Our vacation was half over and this was the 3rd room we had visited. This room, which was on the 3rd floor, had an extremely loud fan that was almost directly over the bed. It pretty much kept us up all night! We did not want to change rooms again, so we just dealt with it. We got up the next morning and decided to go over to Barefoot Billy's (which is the water activities part of the Casa Marina) \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the first person that we met was Nick.

Having worn ourselves out in Orlando in the first week followed by some serious mileage through the Everglades we were looking forward to a few days to relax. Key West did not disappoint!! We loved the drive across the Overseas Highway with the amazing ocean views from our convertible and the hotel was easy to find with plenty of parking available on a lot opposite. The hotel, lobby & it's grounds are amazing with great character - the style reminded me a little of the Ahwahnee in Yosemite perhaps reflecting the era of construction. The pool area is beautiful with a grand facade leading to the white sandy tropical beach complete with palm trees & hammocks. There is a pretty pier extending into the sea - perfect for watching the famous Key West sunset! Our room had been nicely modernised - I liked the Nespresso machine so much I am now the proud owner of a similar model. It was clean & comfortable - more than meeting our needs for the stay. We thought the location was great - it is a fair walk to Mallory square & you have to travel the full length of Duval street to get there but we found this pleasant stroll to be a great way to soak up the laidback atmosphere of the place. They are also on a stop for the trolley bus tour which makes a fun introduction. We loved our stay in Key West - there is loads to do & see. The restaurants were great & we ate some fabulous seafood around the Marina - typically followed by a slice of the delicious Key Lime Pie. Of course the famous Mallory square is a must for the daily sunset party. Unfortunately, throughout our trip the weather had conspired to cheat us of a full senset - each evening a cloud would drift from the horizon blocking the last few rays of the sun. As luck would have it, on our final day we took the Jolly II Rover schooner sunset sail & were rewarded with a flawless romantic sunset. Having had such an amazing trip this seemed the perfect time to propose so I made my declarations on bended knee to my unsuspecting partner. Happily she said yes! What more can I say?

Myself and my extended family, including 4 teenagers had the pleasure to stay at the Casa Marina over New Years. The property is beautiful and relaxing. It is one of the few properties in Key West to be located on a sandy beach. The property is located about a 15-20 minute walk from Duval Street where all the restraurants and shops are located. The property offers 2 pools and located in the middle of both pools are a restraurant and bar. The conceraige Don made many wonderful recomendations for dinner and water sport activities. Fin was our favorite restraurant! If you get a chance stop by for a spectacular \"tapas\" dinner. Another favorite for breakfast was Sara Beth's (try their homemade juice). We used the fitness center (located across the street). The facility was huge and offered plenty of equipment with no wait, fresh towels and water. We also ate breakfast (buffet) outside and lunch outside at the hotel both were excellant, wait service was very accommodating. Water, samples of the drink of the day and popsicles where brought around the beach and pool daily. The popsicles where a welcome sight midday (a great way to cool off)!

There was not a single unpleasant person on staff. They were quick to take care of our needs, knew our names and even knew our circumstances.

If you plan on doing water sports while vacationing at the Casa Marina, be sure to have the front desk arrange it for you. They are experts and really have great connections. The room accommodations are incredible also. I cannot emphasize enough how fantastic this hotel is. You may pay a bit of a premium to stay here, but you DO NOT get what you pay for at the Casa Marina....you get more than expected!

The grounds and public spaces are beautiful and meticulously maintained and the beach/pool staff terriic. The rest of the stay was pretty awful. I booked a King room with the usual understanding that we we have either a King bed or 2 doubles based on availalbity. When we checked in we were advised that we were \"UPGRADED\" to a suite. What a joke! There were 2 rooms but it there was a single Queen bed in the bedroom when I called to expalin that this was not what I ordered, I was told that since the couch pulled out to a bed there was nothing to be done. Somehow a 5 Star resort thinks that 6 nights on pullout is the norm. The bedroom had only one night stand, a pole lamp on the other side of the bed hung so far over the bed that you hit your head on the light. The cover was missing so you looked into a bare light bulb. The TV was kind of small and set TO THE SIDE OF THE BED. Why would anyone place a TV on the side of the bed? You can't just sit in bed and watch TV without twisting your neck. There were no drawers for clothing. There was an entertainment unit for the TV but it had shelves and was open in the back so our attempt at putting our clothes away resulted in things falling out the back. We kept our things in our suitcases the entire time. The faucet in the sink was broken and the table wabbled so badly it was unusable. It was like staying with friends who set up a cot in the den. The bed was made every day, but I don't think the bathroom was cleaned until Sunday (5th day) and we were never sure what linens they would decide to leave. Some days bath towels, some days hand towels occassionally a wash cloth. We learned to snag a few towels before leaving the beach to ensure there would be something with which to shower. The food has always been just OK. Not great but perfectly accepatble hotal fare, so we usually had breakfast on site. This time, there was a large covention holding private functions in the hotel restaurant and dining patio, so the only option for breafast was an overpriced buffet crammed into the pool bar area.

My husband and I stayed at the Casa Marina for 5 nights at the over Christmas. We came from New York and have stayed at Waldorf in New York many times, so we were expecting the same class of service. I should have know we were in trouble when I walked into a room that looked like it had not been dusted in weeks. The morning after I asked the front desk to have someone clean up the dust on all the surfaces, the floor and clear the spider webs in the bathroom. We came back to our room later that day and surprise it was not done. Again I complained the next day to have the room cleaned, again they failed to clean the floors properly. I finally ended up pulling the maid into our room, cleaning the floor myself and then showing her the filth on the floor. Another issue with the rooms are that the windows on the island view rooms do not open. This is a serious issue for there is no fan in the bathroom, so the moisture collects in the sheets, so by the time your ready for bed, you feel like your jumping into a pool, its a disgusting feeling. I had to wear my sweatshirt and sweat pants to feel dry while sleeping. Room service is hard to order with no menu. When we asked for a menu they said they would bring it right up. It didn't arrive and we waited like idiots for 40 minutes. We then just ordered a generic lunch for we had no idea what what they offered for lunch, for we never received a menu. The gym, gross!! The treadmill was not cleaned in the 5 days we were there. The smell was so bad, my husband propped open the back door so we can get through our work out. Another issue, the bartenders and service people around the pool are on some other time schedule that I am not aware of. No one walked up to take our order for 15 minutes. They have absolutely no customer service skills. On the final day we had a person ask us if we needed a drink. When we ordered a coffee, they brought us Starbucks paper cups, not a proper service, with no sugar or milk. Its very interesting that the prices of the rooms and resort fees are that of a five star hotel, but the service is that of a 3 star holiday inn. All the staff are super polite and welcoming when you walk into the hotel, but what is the point of that when they disappear, don't clean your room, and don't serve. The GM of this hotel really needs to spend time with his people and get them on the same page and turn around the service component that is needed for a hotel that charges over $300 a night.

The Trip Advisor reviews were mixed, and it was clear that the \"Waldorf Collection\" is a misnomer, so I was prepared for an experience unlike the famous NYC Waldorf Astoria. Granted, I'm here on HHonors points, and I am well aware of the fact that I therefore take second priority to paying guests (this is dumb, but I understand how the world works). Even still, I've been incredibly disappointed by virtually every element of my stay. But in the spirit of starting the new year on a positive note, I'll first identify the plusses of this hotel: * the setting, on a private beach, is lovely, with great old-world architecture (in the main building), a grand walkway to the beach (lined with mini-reflecting pools), a grand veranda overlooking the pools/ocean * staff set up lounge chairs w/ample towels upon request * this is the most dog-friendly hotel I've seen in America--a deal-breaker for some, no doubt, but as a dog-lover extraordinaire, I love it * the (comped) self-parking lot is just across the street, so it's easy to check in, drop off your bags, and park in just a few moments * the gym, while in a separate building, is quite well equipped, with not only a lot of cardio machines, but a rack of free weights, a universal rack, numerous exercise balls, jump ropes, and a number of Nautilus-esque (I didn't note the brand) weight machines * the decor of the lobby and rooms is a nice blend of old-world and modern * the concierge called to let me know I'd left my credit card with him Ok, upon reflection, that's a long list of positives. But the overall experience has been very disappointing: * our first room was small and extremely far from the lobby, with a view of a parking lot * this room had a tub so filthy I wasn't eager to stand in it to shower * the a/c dripped water (internally, but it was LOUD) all night The front desk was somewhat surly in informing me that New Year's Eve is a very busy week, and an ocean-front room simply wasn't available. But six hours later, the front desk did call my cell to let me know my bags had been moved to a 2nd room in the original (1920s vintage) part of the hotel. This room is much larger. But the noise from the hallway is EXTREMELY LOUD, whether guests walking by or, more common, housekeeping staff gabbing incessantly. I wouldn't put up with this noise level in a $80/night Hampton Inn, so here it's especially egregious. Ok, so the rooms leave a lot to be desired, though if I had an ocean-facing view, I'm sure I'd be less annoyed. Other criticisms: * ALL of the staff have been surly except for the guy who set up lounge chairs/towels on the beach * the breakfast was terrible--overpriced, of course--but skimpy in portion, weak in execution, and overall completely dissatisfying * my friend left a t-shirt in the first room by mistake; 36 hours later, despite a call and a voicemail with housekeeping, he's not heard a word about its whereabouts * the gift shop serves fake (i.e., \"brewed by\") Starbucks @ $4.50 for just a basic coffee (nothing fancy) * the flat-screen television (24\" at best) is so small I can't see it from the bed and therefore haven't even bothered to turn it on * the modern bathroom sink has a contemporary faucet mounted on the left side; while aesthetically appealing, it's virtually impossible to wash your hands with this setup * the windows don't open Overall, I am just totally disappointed by this hotel and especially the surly and unhelpful staff.

I encountered nothing that concerned me, other than the musty, strange smell that was always present in the lobby. Everything seemed clean, in good repair, and the bed was comfy. I got good service at the pool and beach, and they did have \"drink of the day\" samples and free popsicles. The gym is spacious and has nice new equipment. The beach was clean and pleasant, and it's not the resort's fault that Key West doesn't have sandy beaches where you can just walk out into the water. But there was nothing really special or exciting about the property either. There's nothing in particular that makes you feel at home or that you'd really like to come back. The service is fine but not outstanding, there are not really any special touches or things they do to make you feel like they really value you. If you eat at the resort, the food is fine, but not that interesting, and it is definitely overpriced. I was fine with the location - it is at the far South end of the island, a few blocks from Duval Street, but not the end of Duval where the action is. That was fine with me because it was quiet, and I felt like I was burning plenty of calories with a brisk 1/2 hour walk down to the other end where all the bars are, but if you want to be right in the middle of things you should probably choose somewhere else. Also, Key West wasn't really what I hoped it would be. Unlike the reviewer below, I was prepared for it to be full of non-conservative people who like to drink a lot, but I guess I was also thinking it would be like a big fun party with some good shopping. In reality, it's actually kind of lame. I did love the Happy Hour specials with half-price or BOGO drinks and apps, since I'm from MA where we don't have happy hour drink specials. But other than that, blah. It's just kind of tacky, and I feel like it's catering to a certain kind of person that isn't me. Someone with some money but no taste, maybe, who's a hard-core alcoholic and wants to be surrounded by people who won't judge them for that? The shopping was either low-quality / no-style T-shirt shops, or trendy designer stuff at high price points. I was hoping there would be boutiques that had fun, cool, and unique clothes and accessories at moderate price points, but there was really nothing like that. Evan and Elle is the kind of store I was looking for, but just too expensive. And the galleries were full of pretentious salespeople and a lot of tasteless art in garish colors. Ok, not all of them, but a lot. And Mallory Square - stay away! Gross. We liked Venice Beach in L.A. and thought this would be a similar scene, but it's just way too creepy and weird. The \"entertainers\" all seemed like people you'd encounter in a psychiatric hospital, and you felt like your pocket was going to be picked at any moment. We walked in and walked back out. Sunset Pier was a much nicer place to watch the sunset with a drink in hand. Overall, we were looking for somewhere warm but within the continental US to relax for a few days and completely chill out. I thought this would be it, but it wasn't. Something is just \"off\" about the whole place, that I can't put my finger on. I did encounter exactly that in Fort Meyers at the Sanibel Resort a couple of years ago, but without as much night life as I would have liked. It didn't help that they were having a cold snap down there and we brought the wrong clothes and ended up wearing jeans and a sweatshirt every night, but neither the location nor the hotel did anything for me that counteracted the disappointing weather. This is my honest opinion, and I do want to state that I like to party, ride a motorcycle, and enjoy any occasion where I can have a few cocktails and dress up in crazy costumes or what have you. I love the beach and warm weather. I would have thought Key West would be my kind of scene, but it just wasn't.

Our room was clean and bright but lacked a homely feel. We ate breakfast a la carte but it was always delivered cold to the table - we complained once but when it recurred we just stopped mentioning it. We took lunch at the Sun Sun restaurant which was ok in taste but over-priced (as was all food at the resort). Dinner menu was ok, nothing special, but the after dinner decaf coffee delivered to the table was so strong as to be completely undrinkable. Pricing for the bicycles and mopeds at the resort was simply ridiculous, and stopped us hiring completely. Staff at the resort were variable in manner - the central European staff were not particularly friendly and in some cases almost surly, whilst the US and Carribean staff were fine. Key West: A strong word of caution. Neither I nor my partner are particularly conservative, but we both felt very (very!) uncomfortable in Key West. I believe Lonely Planet describes it thus - \"it's as if someone has shaken the US and all the nuts fell to the bottom\" (we read this after arrival). We found Key West to be a place frequented by (what appeared to us to be) misfits and/or alcoholics. Walking Key West at night, we did not feel secure. We found Duval Street to be sleazy and seedy, and indeed found Key West as a whole to be very down market. We are a normal couple, earning average salaries and with average tastes, and we have vowed never to return to Key West because of it's weirdness and downbeat feel. If you are looking for a relaxed, upmarket island feel, go to a nice Carribean island, NOT key West.

We spent a lot of time researching all of the accommodation in Key West and chose Casa Marina because it is part of The Waldorf Astoria group, which is a name you associate with luxury and quality, but also because of the good reviews the hotel has received. The hotel itself is fabulous, with a stunning entrance way. Our room was spotless, air conditioned and had an uninterrupted view over the pool and out to sea. In general, you will find that the prices in Key West for \u00e2\u20ac\u0153quality\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd(4 or 5 star equivalent) accommodation are extremely high. There is no real justification for this, apart from not having a choice once you have arrived and many tourists wanting to make Key West a vacation stop(often having to drive for 4-5 hours from Miami). We paid 378 dollars for the room for the night(including breakfast), which is on a par with the price you might pay for an extremely nice hotel in New York or Miami. However, I would not consider the attractions or amenities in Key West anywhere near in comparison with either city destination. Sure, it's a holiday destination, but we were expecting more from the Keys, in terms of expectations and other people's recommendations. The main issue that we had with the hotel was that unknown to us, they were hosting the annual \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Parrot head\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd conference. This is a charitable organisation with positive intentions, but we did not feel this hotel was a suitable venue for this event. After having driven 5 hours from Miami to get to Key West, we were tired and were looking forward to chilling out by the pool, in a luxury hotel(one of the most, if not the most, expensive hotels in Key West). We have stayed at equivalent luxury beach resort hotels around the world so we were expecting a relaxing atmosphere. Strangely, the pool area had loud, live music in the afternoon with people shouting, clapping and jeering. Don't get me wrong , live music can be great, in the right setting and context. This was neither. The singer could best be decribed as country and Western and was singing songs with lyrics including; \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I caught my wife on another man's lap\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd and \u00e2\u20ac\u0153beer-run, I love drinking beer\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. This music did not seem fitting to the venue and we were unsure whether this was typical hotel entertainment(no mention of this on hotel website) or if it was part of the entertainment for the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153parrot heads\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd conference. The next day we went down to breakfast. Due to the volume of people arriving and staying at the hotel, the breakfast area felt like something from a Las Vegas buffet(although with much less choice and less quality) \u00e2\u20ac\u201c People were scrambling to pile as much food on their plates as possible and this was not what we were expecting. People were starting to arrive from other locations in the area for the event, so the foyer and pool area were becoming extremely busy. It appeared to be a dress down occassion with people wearing multi-coloured t-shirts saying 'gypsy palace' (which I found to be offensive). After breakfast, we checked out, put our luggage in the car and went for a walk around Key West. When we came back there were literally hundreds of people milling around the front of the hotel. We walked back into the hotel, to use the toilet, through the main foyer and were asked by a member ofparrot head security if we had a 'pass'? We said \u00e2\u20ac\u0153no\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd and were told we were not allowed in the hotel! This instantly made us somewhat surprised and outraged. We had just spent shy of 400 dollars and were not allowed back in the hotel. We were not the only hotel guests party to this treatment, as another guest whose luggage was in his room was also not allowed back in. By this point, I was very angry and depite my explanations about staying at the hotel, was not allowed in. We ignored the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153parrot head's\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd security and walked on in. We were then told; \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I'm calling hotel security\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, which we urged him to do, to hopefully get the situation resolved. My partner was almost manhandled out the hotel. We eventually got hold of a member of hotel staff, who agreed that the current situation was ridiculous. She told us that a member of their own staff had not been allowed in! The long and short of our stay is this- 1. It's a beautiful hotel in a fabulous setting. 2. It's overpriced. You don't get what you pay for \u00e2\u20ac\u201c however, if you want to visit Key West, this is the norm. I had a good look at other hotels and feel the Casa Marina was the best quality hotel in the area. 3. In my opinion, we should have been told about the Parrot head event. If this was the case, we WOULDN'T have booked this hotel. I also do not feel this hotel was the sort of hotel that should have been hosting this event. Good cause, wrong venue. 4. I personally don't blame the Parrot head security for not allowing us in. It was the hotel who had organised this. However, this should NEVER have been agreed in the first place, so I blame poor hotel management. I have never been at a luxury hotel before and made to feel like a 'criminal' for entering back into the hotel that an hour before you had just handed over 378 dollars to. It has left a bitter taste in my mouth and I will think twice about booking into a Waldorf Astoria collection hotel in the future, if this is their approach to running an event at the same time as claiming to provide a pleasant guest experience. A good tip would be to check if an event/conference is taking place at the same time as your stay. Your hotel will be unlikely to let you know.", "Date": "November 13, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "North Bethesda, Maryland", "Title": "\u201cGreat Hotel\u201d", "Author": "shlak", "ReviewID": "UR86905251", "Content": "We Stayed at the Casa Marina for 5 nights.

To preface, I am a frequent traveller and have stayed at all levels of hotels both independents and branded so I have seen it done all different ways. I can assure you that you will not get the level of service at the beach and pool for a better price anywhere else. While it would be very nice to not have this at all most other locations simply charge extra for the additional services/amenities and it will typically add up to a higher cost. Using only my experiences in Florida I have typically had to pay at least $20-$30 to have chairs and umbrella set up on the beach. This can usually be charged to the room but in some cases I have had to pay directly at time of service. At this property they rake the sand each morning on the substantial private beach and as you arrive you are greeted by the team and they set everything up for you wherever you would like on the beach, next to the pool, in a hammock between palm trees or in the shady grass area. They set up the chairs and umbrella's, bring fresh towels and anything else needed to start you off (followed of course by the waitstaff with refreshments). On hot days they will even pass out popsicles in the afternoon. Another benefit is that they have snorkel gear, sand toys for kids and many other 'extras' to loan you (as opposed to 'rent'), they even loaned us a fishing pole for my son to use off of one of their two piers. The fee also provides free internet which is usually a separate charge at upscale hotels. To sum this up, the set $25 resort fee was a much greater value than the a la carte format. Key West is a tropical paradise, however, if you are looking for 'beach' front location be aware that most properties do not offer this or if so not very well. This hotel is from what I have seen the single exception to this. They offer a substantial beach area with a small pier in the middle that takes you out to where it is deep enough to swim/snorkel (about 15 yards or so), there are no waves in this area and it is only about 2 1/2 feet deep 10 feet into the water. This offers the best of both worlds. We travelled with 2 small children (twin toddlers) and our 7 year old son and this allowed all of us to enjoy the beach and warm water of the ocean without concern of waves, undercurrents, riptides or dropoffs. There is also plenty of sea life all around the island and it can be experienced without leaving the resort with only a snorkel. In addition to the on-site activities director who had wonderful things for the kids (Merideth), the beach/pool staff (Tom and Niko (sp?)) took my son around the beach/pool area to show him the wildlife they would stumble upon throughout our stay (hermit crabs, the resident iquanas, the fish easily visible from the pier, sea urchins when the tide is right and much more). The team at the front desk was phenomenal help. They took great care to make sure we had a room that would fit our families needs needs and had excellent advice/reccomendations throughout our stay, they really made our stay (Thanks to Ruth, Evelyn & Patrick) Our rooms were cleaned thoroughly daily and they would refresh our towells again when providing turn down service in the evenings. The food at the hotel was good but we ended up eating out for most of the stay, they did offer dining right on the beach at night and you get a great sunset at this location. The main area of town in walkable but it is a good distance, cabs are plentiful and it is only a three to five minute drive. All of the public beaches are on the side of the island beginning right next door to the hotel (though you will not need them with all of their private beach). Also directly next to the hotel, right on the beach, is a restaraunt Salute. We had another guest reccomend this to us that went as a couple and we found it to be one of the best places we have run across to have dinner with children. They offer a great and inexpensive childrens menu but the highlight is that it is literally separated from the sandy beach by only a walkway. Children were running all around the beach and playing on the volleyball courts allowing adults to enjoy and adult meal without worry. We left feeling like we really knew many of the guests and the hotel staff, it is great to be around friends.

Being Hilton Diamond, we picked this hotel in Key West. We contacted the hotel twice after we made our reservation to request early check in, late check out, shuttle service and we also mentioned the reasons we were coming. Never got a reply. So when we showed up at the airport, we took a cab (8$/ pers) (in the end, we learned that the shuttle or cab is the same price when we left) and of course our room wasn't ready ( afterwards, we received a call while out for lunch to let us know it was). I can't complain because it's not fair to expect a gesture, but we unlike other reviewers didn't get a special gift in our room even though we had said it was for a couple of special occasions. As Elite Hilton Honors, you will not get anything for breakfast, only a discount on the resort fee. In some way, our gesture was to be upgraded to an ocean view room. I should be appreciative, but it's almost a given as Elite (if not full)... There is a N*spresso machine in the room with a few doses that were replenished every day. A not so funny thing: toilet paper was running low, and there were no spare rolls in the room. Wasn't changed at next service. We actually really ran out and had to use tissue for 2 days until they finally realized it... Bathroom is poorly designed. Shower is narrow. There is no room around the sink to put your stuff. I ranked the \"sleep quality\" quite low for a couple of reasons. Mattress itself wasn't bad, but the box was making noises. We joked about it at first and then it became really unpleasant when I had my frequent nightly bathroom trips. Also, they vacuum the hallways at 8am and will bang at your door even if you have the privacy sign. And the maids don't understand english when you yell \"no\" or \"later\" or simply open the door and show them the sign. Let me now talk about the pools/ beach. 2 pools, I didn't see a hottub. Pretty disgusting: I know you have to expect sand in the pool, but not necessarily hair, fibers, oil and other gross things that were in suspension. I think they could clean it more, or better. Resort fee includes free popsicle ice creams and drink of the day samples. Never saw their \"drink of the day samples\". Pool boy #1 showed up on day 1 and I told him to give the ice cream on his way back so that my husband would be back (he was just getting out of the water). Never came back. Pool boy #2 comes 1h after and asks me if he can get me anything. I mention that I am still waiting for the popsicles, he says he would take care of it. Well, I am still waiting. Next day, I wanted to get a glass of water at the tanks available at the pools. It was empty, so I ask pool boy #1. The guy complains that he has already filled it twice. I don't care. The beach is not nice white sand: there is glass which is not being removed even if they rake the beach everyday. You should wear flipflops or be careful and I would be worried with kids unless they were the plastic water shoes. There is a small pier to go into the water. It's slippery because they do not take care of the algae. I actually slipped one day and fell even though I was being careful (adult, aware, pregnant). I would be very concerned with children. You can swin to an isolated deck which has a little bit of nice sealife to see (you can rent snorkeling for 8$/h, 20$/ day, or buy at the hotel shop or even walk to C*S and buy for less). Snorkeling gets much better if you are not afraid to swim a little more to a bigger pier on the left. It separates the hotel area and a public beach but the sealife that surrounds it is great. There is a corner and some of the pier is collapsed so you can go to the other side. We saw a stingray, numerous colorful fish (I have no clue of their names), conches (they were alive, we were just diving, picking them up and looking, not taking them out of the water), starfish,... It's one of the best snorkeling place in KeyWest unless you do a boat trip. Actually, a few years back, we took a boat trip and we didn't see anything (streams were strong and sand was in suspension). But don't expect it to be DryTortugas either, this is worth the trip. We had lunch at the beach restaurant one day. It was ok. Breakfast: only buffet while we were there, 20$/pers. Buffet is ok, but really not impressive at all. Some basics were not there like waffles, pancakes, or french toast. There were pastries, muffins, bread, omelette station, potatoes, ham, oatmeal, cereal and fruits. Unpleasant surprise as they charged us different amounts on different days for the same things (buffet!) and they forced an 18% tip on the bill. I am sorry, but if this is buffet and I get up and get my food and someone comes once to get me my drink and not even remove my plate, that's not 18%. I complained and this got fixed. We were going out for dinners and most lunches. There are a couple of nice places if you don't mind walking a little or taking a cab. Mallory square is 30/45 min walk. That's good if you want a quiet family resort, not so good if you plan to party all night. Overall: It's a nice place (nice resort facility, nice snorkeling, room comfort is ok), but service is clearly not up to the Waldorf Astoria name. I guess it's fine if you are aware of it.

I made a joke how great it would be to have one sent up to my room & provided my room number. About a half hour later a staff member knocked on my door & presented me with the most unbelievable crustless & strawberry pb&j sandwich accompanied by huge berries and a cold glass of milk. It really doesn't get much better than that and I cannot recall ever in any of my trips, and there have been ALOT, a staff member to ever pay so much attention to detail and then to go above and beyond like that to actually accommodate a silly half serious request. It was one the highlights of our trip. Every door was opened for us and greeted with warm friendly staff everywhere we went on the grounds. Poolside service was incomparable to any other....it included towel service (as well as outstanding food & beverage service), mid-day mistings for those really hot days, free popsicles and sample drinks of the day.

The one plus to the rooms is that the bed is very soft & comfy! The other downfall to the resort is the distance from Duval Street & Mallory Square. It took us around 15-20 minutes to get to Duval. If you want to make it to the far end of Duval or Mallory Square I would guess that it would take 30+ minutes. We took a cab when we needed to go to the opposite end of the Duval strip. On the plus side, the pool & pool bar were nice to hang out at. The hotel also offers a great sunset catamaran trip on Wednesday and Saturday nights for $55 per person.

You have a choice of sitting by two pools or on the beach. We swam in the ocean just about everyday. The best way to get into the ocean is via the pier which takes you out over the coral and on to some sand and grassy areas which are not uncomfortable for us. The fitness center was one of the best i've found in a hotel in a very long time. I didn't give the resort 5 stars for one reason. when we checked in i was told we'd get an upgrade to a ocean front suite at no extra charge.

They quoted us the wrong rate, but thankfully the kind manager at the hotel agreed to honor the original verbal quoted rate. We arrived after a long drive from the Miami area and were please with the look and feel of the lobby, but it is rather small and dark. Our room for the stay was an Ocean View King with a separate living area (with roll out sofa). The room looked tired and worn. You could tell they used very cheap drywall when remodeling the room and it was peeling in many places and you can easily hear into the next room. The AC worked very well, but the drywall was wet all around the vents and mold was evident. We had a very nice view from the room and enjoyed it as much as we could. The room does have HD TVs in all rooms, but no HD channels are available sadly. Pros: 1) VERY FRIENDLY STAFF - most all of the staff we met were very helpful and genuinely happy to talk with you (this made up for the hotels faults in other areas). Darrin at the pool restaurant was the best! 2) COMFORTABLE BEDS - better than Westin heavenly beds and the linens were of good quality! 3) NICE VIEWS - especially from the outdoor breakfast area and pool CONS: 1) LACK OF A REAL BEACH AND DANGEROUS STEPS INTO OCEAN - this hotel does NOT have a sandy beach. It is very rocky and you have to walk out onto a pier and down a VERY SLIPPERY set of metal steps (encrusted with seaweed) to get to the water. My mother slipped and fell on the steps and hurt herself while at the hotel. The hotel needs to fix this liability ASAP... it's a lawsuit waiting to happen. Also, why was the lack of a real beach never mentioned on the website? 2) LIMITED DINNER MENU - don't even think of eating at the hotel for dinner. There's barely any entrees to choose from and they are all mediocre at best and far overpriced. We were quoted $55 if we wanted twin lobster tails! The hotel should really have thought of adding an FAMILY restaurant that is reasonably priced to keep the guests at the hotel at night to generate more profit. Hardly any guests at the hotel every evening.

My points would be: Very nice grounds, two good pools, beach is articficial, but is very large for the keys, you can not really walk in to the sea due to rocks, which are needed, otherwise the beach would wash away as it is not natural. We found the staff very good, free drink and iced popsicle at lunch time around the pool, very good service on the pool chairs etc.., loved the hammocks. Casa is at the other end of Key West to Mallorey Square and the busy end of Duval St. I do not see this is a negative, indeed a positive. Other good quality hotels in Key West are right on the docks, with little privacy. Key West is less than 2 miles wide, it's not far to Duval, and a taxi is US$10. We found a number of decent restaurants within walking distance. We have stayed at a number of other Waldorf collection hotels (Naples Grande and the Waldorf Astoria) the rooms at Casa are by far the worst. We upgraded to a Ocean View Balcony. Be aware standard rooms over look the road, and have no balcony. Even in our upgraded room, the bathroom was very small, tiny bath for kids only, and one small sink. This compared to the Naples Grande, which has a huge bath, walk in shower, and two large sinks. The rooms are more 3* standard, unless you pay for a top end suite.

Normally, I would not devote my time to this endeavor. In short, there are far better places to stay in Key West. That is the bottom line. Here are a list of reasons not to stay at this hotel. They are in no particular order. 1. The location is awful. This place is far away from the center of town and there is nothing to see or do near this hotel. You can't even find a place to eat near here. This is perfect for the hotel, since you will be forced to eat their average food and pay gourmet prices. Also, when nightfall arrives (assuming you don't have a car and why would you?), be prepared to pay inflated cab prices to get to and from the center of town. These costs pile up and you will feel cheated. 2. The private beach is awful. If you like rocky, smelly beaches without a shoreline, then this private beach is for you. Don't be sold by the lure of a private beach. In general, beaches in Key West are sub-standard. This place is no different. As a aside, if you are looking to lay on a nice beach on your vacation, do not go to Key West. Save some money and go to Miami instead. 3. The service is not very good for the money. The people at the front desk are borderline incompetent. When I arrived, I was given a room that was already occupied. (Luckily, I heard rustling through the door, which stopped me from walking in on this stranger.) The woman at the front desk apologized saying \"I don't know how she got in there\" and assigned me to another room. (What a terrible excuse! Great way to shift blame on to the woman in the room. Assuming the woman did not belong in there, what does this say about hotel security?) All in all, we wasted our time here. Don't make the same mistake.

The hotel is very nice (albeit a stretch for the \"Waldorf\" classification) and the location/beachfront cannot be matched. However what blew me away and has galavanized me as a permanent patron is a horrible day we encountered. Through a complete cluster-F snaffoo with the front desk, we had an recurring issue with maid service scheduling due to the fact that we had 2 Chihuahuas with us. These snaffoos set off a series of other blunders with trying to schedule our day and enjoy KW. After our day was shot, I asked for the Manager on duty at the time. Turns out the Manager on duty (Cindy A.) was actually the night manager filling in. To make a long story short, this Manager received my numerous compaints with complete professionalism and immediately jumped into action with a series of offerings to make good on the blunders. IN short, her attitude of \"we're going to do what ever it takes to make this right\" was beyond exraordinary -- an attitude that is almost extinct in the realm of customer service today. My wife and I were both so impressed and validated on our complaints, that suddenly Casa Marina was the best resort we had ever visited. A little over embellished, perhaps, however Cindy definitely understood the platform that positive customer service can reverse a negative experience all day every day. The net loss to the hotel was probably $50 in F&B charges, but what they gained was at least 10k in future guest profits from our stays to come. Not a bad ROI. In this day and age, sales people are glorified for the \"acquisitional\" sales home runs all the time.

This was our last stop at the end of our long road trip and we were booking somewhere that we thought would be really luxurious and somewhere where we could feel well looked after and hence were willing to pay a for it. Having stayed there we didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t feel looked after and considering the price you were paying for it you really felt short changed for what you got. The overall feeling you got from the hotel was that they tried to provide you with the minimum service/facilties for the maximum charge that they could get away with. On arrival we found that there was a $25 compulsory resort fee per day that you had to pay for staying there and using their pool/beach and other resort facilities. And yes, it was compulsory, so why would you not include it in the initial room price? We were not aware of this till we arrived and we were surprised we had an extra charge for staying there when we had already paid for the rooms. If the room price was $25 per day extra we would have still booked here as that was a small cost compared to the overall price we paid but to come here and find out that there were other non-transparent costs really annoyed us. We do not expect that kind of approach when you pay that much for somewhere, and that generally reflected the overall approach of the hotel. They were not interested in making you feel good or in you having a good experience during your stay, they were more interested in maximising their profit for the least effort. The service was pretty poor. We often had to wait a long time to get through to the front desk on the phone. Once I got through and the guy put me on hold, I waited ages before it went onto voicemail and then cut me off. The guy didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t even have the courtesy to call back after that.

They didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have a problem moving us but they kept us waiting a long time while they sorted it all out and I didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t feel like they made any effort in trying to do it quicker as were just in limbo mode waiting to get on with our day. The one positive thing was that the resort pool and beach area was pretty. However, the pools themselves were quite small for the amount of guests there and were always busy. If you wanted to swim you had to wait till the evening to get the space. The beach itself was fake. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s good enough if all you want to do is sit around on it but if you want to go swimming in the sea then you had to go onto a pier that takes you into the sea but the water is still murky there with lots of seaweed that I would not recommend swimming there. The restaurant had extremely limited choice of food, and you quickly get very bored of it. First time we went the waiter forgot our order so we waited an hour to be served. Although you are meant to have waiter service in the beach area (as part of your \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcresort fee\u00e2\u20ac\u2122), they were always too busy that you had to go and order at the bar or restaurant. Most hotels we stayed at had free wifi and a free printer connected to a common computer. Although wifi was \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcfree\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 (meaning included in the resort fee), it didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t work by the pool area and any printing had to be done at the business centre which had excessive charges associated with it. Generally speaking we got the impression that the management wouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t go out of their way to help you and were not interested in you having a good experience. After we checked out and got to the airport my husband realised that he had left his hat in the room by mistake. We called and asked if they could send it on the shuttle bus or to put it in a taxi to the airport. It was only a 10 minute journey from the airport and we said we would pay for it so we thought it wouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be a big deal for them but it would have been really helpful for us as it would have saved us time from going back to collect it. In their usual unhelpful way they refused. They said that their shuttle was busy for the next couple of hours and they wouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t ask a taxi. My husband then went back to collect it himself and found out that it was a lie that the shuttle was busy, it hadn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t been used since our last trip to the airport and it no further bookings on it either. We got better service and facilities at much cheaper places we stayed at in our trip. It was a total waste of money and we will not be going back there again.", "Date": "July 23, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Ft.

Our room was not ready. The front desk girl said she would call me when the room was available. She never called and I waited, sitting right in front of her desk in the lobby. Luckily they had a nice lime refreshment in the lobby to take the edge off the afternoon heat and rehydrate while waiting for our room to be ready. About an hour later I went to the girl and she said she called me and my room was all ready. Anyway I had no missed calls and no messages. Not my favorite way to start a long weekend. For sure, I did not like the dishonesty! Good thing I didn't need her for anything else during my stay. FIRST TIP:There is a ton of street parking. Do NOT pay $15 a day to park. You can park on the street. It was my first time at the hotel so I Was expecting updated rooms given the millions spent on the renovation. Housekeeping was under par for what I expected, like leaving dirty glasses in room, trash cans just tossed into the room. The rooms were more Westin. We had no view but we didnt pay for the ocean room suite either. The hotel grounds are just lovely. The pool areas are beautifully laid out with fountains, plenty of towels and chairs and properly staffed. Lots of places to sit outside enjoy the weather and the stars in the sky. The property boosts a large private beach. Although true, Key West is not known for amazing beaches. I wouldn't even go into the water due to the preservation of wild life, i.e. massive amounts of sea weed and giant fish. NEXT TIP: do not go to key west for the beach unless you like seaweed. I had a gelato that was delicious from the hotel store but the counter girl was not friendly. The hotel is about a 15 minute walk to Duval street. It's a great idea to rent bikes. We rented bikes from the hotel..they were a little more expensive (LIke $5 more for the day rate, maybe?) than the other places around but convenience is worth it. Not sure if I would stay again at this hotel. This was my 3rd time to Key West. Better values elsewhere. At checkout I mentioned to the front desk guy and the concierge that we were checking out early because of a reality show on motorcycles leaving the island at 11:00 a.m. They had no idea about the \"massive traffic jam road race\" on the islands going from the key through Miami.

They would set up your beach chairs, install and umbrella for you, and even put a little table next to you. There were hammocks on the beach, 2 pools, and a good restaurant for lunch. The hotel store which sold sundries was way overpriced, but what can you expect from a hotel store. Although they didn't have a free shuttle to/from the airport, they did offer a van ($8/pp) to take you there. Taxis were plentiful, Duval street was walkable if you are reasonably fit (20-30 minutes), and the whole experience was great. Beware of the pedi-cabs that roam Duval.

The Casa Marina is a beautiful resort. Overall we received great service from all of the staff and bartenders. The Flagler Ocean View rooms are pretty much your basic old style hotel room with a tiny bathroom and NO balcony. We highly recommend avoiding these rooms as they are just above the Ocean View suites that have wooden deck balconies. So when our downstairs neighbors decided to come back from partying until 4 AM they headed to their balcony, slid the chairs all over the place and continued their partying. It sounded like they were in our room with us. After a couple of early morning wakeups, we contacted the front desk and security was sent to quiet things down. We believe that they checked out the following day and our night's sleep went undisturbed from then on. The next time we decide to go to Key West we will be sure to book an ocean view room with a balcony in the newer part of the facility, which is pretty much a modern hotel construction with concrete walls and floors. The facility is very well maintained and the private beach, pool decks and public areas are always clean. We never had difficulty finding a chair by the pool or a seat at the outdoor bar.Although there are several hammocks, they were sometimes difficult to find available. Drinks and meals are very expensive at this resort. The breakfast buffet is $20 per person and ala carte will still run approximately $20 each. Tropical drinks are $8 each and need a bit more alcohol to make them worth the costs. They always offer drink specials so keep on the look out from them.

We arrived fairly late in the evening, with several bags, but there was no one at the door, and therefore no one offered to take our luggage to our room. The sole desk clerk seemed bored and annoyed to be checking us in, and when asked about the location of the SCUBA shop the on-site watersports facility had booked early morning dives for us the next morning, proclaimed ignorance and said \"I'm not from here, I don't know.\" Great, off to a good start. We booked a one-bedroom Island Vista suite, and found our way there--to a first floor room, next to the elevator (DING!!! all night long) and ice machine. On top of it, we were inexplicably given a handicapped room. While I am very happy such rooms exist for folks who need them, my husband and I do not need such facilities, and would prefer they remain available for those who do. Ordinarily I would have asked for a different room, but it was late, we were tired and just wanted to crash (somehow I suspect the indifferent desk clerk would have claimed unavailability anyway). The room turned out to be quite inconvenient for us, however--the bar in the closet was at half height--obviously necessary for guests who are in a wheelchair, but meant that our clothes were dragging on the floor, and some ended up needing to be hung on the shower rod. There was a dearth of shelf space, and only a single towel rack in the bathroom. The room itself was spacious and fairly clean, but the furniture (particularly the living room sofa) was beat up, cheap and uncomfortable, and there was fairly constant noise from the road, hallway, elevator and ice machine. The next day, however, we saw how beautiful the grounds were--the beach was lovely, there were two nice pools (though these were party central all weekend), the fitness room was completely unattended, but there were plenty of machines (unlike fitness centers at higher end hotels, however, no water for those working out). We liked the beach bar and the beachside restaurant, service was generally pretty good (though maid service was spotty--wet towels left on the floor for replacement were still there, in a heap, after cleaning). We were generally able to find chairs poolside, and the attendants were friendly and eager to please. During the day, we were also able to see that the small balcony off our room, while primarily an underwhelming view of the road, also caught the edge of the public beach around the corner. The topper, however, came on our third day there--I came face to face with a huge cockroach in the shower. Now, I know that the beauty of FL comes with a price, and that roaches are just a simple fact of life in Florida--but not necessarily at a supposed four-star hotel. When we checked out the next day, I mentioned this to the front desk clerk who just shrugged and smirked, but did not offer any sort of apology. As we had a late afternoon flight, I had asked for late check-out, but the desk agent snorted as said \"check out is ALREADY noon!\" but then said they could extend to 1pm. Gee, thanks. So while we absolutely loved Key West, and will definitely be back, I don't know that we'd return to Casa Marina.", "Date": "June 19, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Roscoe, Illinois", "Title": "\u201cGreat Ocean Views!!!\u201d", "Author": "pam692003", "ReviewID": "UR67941583", "Content": "We went to the Casa Marina for our honeymoon.

Every staff person we encountered was professional, efficient and friendly. The location was far enough away from Duval to give me the laid back I needed, but close enough that we could easily walk when we wanted a night out. Beach services were a lovely touch - assistance with chairs, tables and umbrellas, cold towels late in the afternoon, complimentary drink of the day samples and popsicles. I'd say the Beach Services staff were the highlights of the \"resort\" experience, and probably the only part that really merited that category. The pools were lovely, waterfront easy. My big disappointment is that when I think \"Waldorf Astoria\" and \"resort\" - I've got some higher expectations. Concierge service was intermittent - there's not a manned station, and the timing for when you could catch the concierge was hard for me to figure out. If we played it right, either Chrissy or Don was there with menu and restaurant options and willingness to assist. But when no one was there - which was often - we winged it on our own, and didn't have near the results. There's basically one restaurant/menu in the entire property. So if you're staying there for a week like we did, the same core menu grew tired quickly. We were there over a holiday weekend, and really expected to spend most of that weekend there at the hotel, to keep away from the chaos of Duval Street over the holiday, but the menu choices had us spending time and money off property much earlier than expected. Even though there is a sister property, The Reach, nearby, which has a high end steakhouse, it meant a good walk, so if we were walking we weren't going to waste the evening on a hotel restaurant. Beds comfortable, hot water aplenty, all the basics covered. The room was underwhelming in every detail, efficient, but underwhelming, especially in the bathroom. Felt only slightly larger than a cruise ship's - but no counter space to speak of, and really no place to even hang a towel, much less 2 or 3 of them. I'd stay there again and would recommend it - much was good about it, but I would definitely be very aggressive in looking for a real deal on the room rate. And i would just reset my expectations that I would be staying at a hotel, not a resort, and at a Hilton, not a Waldorf Astoria. And I'd plan on not dining much at the hotel at all, which is great for Key West and its restaurants and bars, but sure seems a missed opportunity for the Casa Marina.", "Date": "June 4, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Bolton, CT", "Title": "\u201cExcellent stay at Casa Marina\u201d", "Author": "dash1_98", "ReviewID": "UR66245488", "Content": "My wife and I stayed at Casa Marina Memorial Day Weekend. Thoroughly enjoyed the visit. CM is a quality hotel with very good service. Really enjoyed Key West -- but dont really recommend it for kids -- too many adult-oriented themes, sites; a lot of drunken partyers and really seems targeted to open-minded adults (even more-so than Vegas, which has a lot of kids activities). Here are my pros and cons (obviously subjective, but we travel a lot and are fairly picky): Room was very nice and spacious, but needs a dresser (just a few shelves in the bureau and a closet for clothes). The cleaning service was spotty (they forgot to come one day). Bed turn down 2 out of 4 nights. I thought the bed was way too soft, but my wife liked it. It was one of the moderate rooms and I give it a B+ -- like a Westin. Grounds were very nice; pools were nice, but very crowded. I was impressed that the staff actually removed some towels off the pool chairs when it was obvious that guests were just reserving them all day. I was also impressed that the staff actually checked room i.d.s and caught \"pool crashers!\" The staff needs to pick up garbage around the pool more. Staff were attentive for food, drinks, towels, chairs (and umbrellas when available). My wife and i enjoyed playing some of the pool-side games (but they are in need of repair). Pool bar was good, but service was spotty. A resort fee of $25/day includes wifi (but they charged me $15 on top of that and I had to have them remove it at check out??) and a very good fitness center, as well as good pool service, plenty of towels, but not enough umbrellas. Concierage(s) and front desk staff were good and steered us correctly to : Hot Tin Roof\" for sunset romantic dinner (pricey but perfect an A+ experience; A&B Lobster House (excellent); a local Cuban place (El Sinoway???); Blue Heaven for breakfast (great but a 1 hour wait -- hint: put your name down and then go do the Hemingway house tour and come back!). Nachos at the touristy Margaritaville were awesome (and we are not into touristy places!! We rented bikes for a day and I scuba dived the USS Vandenberg, booked through the resort's water sports shop (biggest complaint, the water sports folks changed my scuba charge after the event without ever telling me; had i not checked my bill at check-out I would have paid an extra $40. I caught it and the front desk took it off without an argument, but I was peeved.) The resort is located in the \"quiet\" south part of the island so you will need to bike or cab it everywhere ($12 to Mallory Square -- but if you share a cab 1/2 that amount).

The physical property is nice, and the hotel has no doubt spent tons of money on this place, but service falls short.

My reply was, \"we'll take anything at this point.\" We left 2 hours later and did not eat at the hotel again. I was also disappointed that the hotel had no inside dining, although it really didnt matter since we were not eating there again. The advertised indoor dining room, we were informed, was only open for \"special occasions.\" Apparently Memorial Day is not a special occasion to this place. The main bar is also permanently closed, only allowing a small afterthought of a \"bar\" aside the overpriced sundry shop. Our suite was full of termites. We were told we could not move because the hotel was full - full of termites, full of themselves, full of what? This was an unacceptable explanation. A gesture of perhaps spraying would have sufficed, but this is, apparently, too much to ask for a $600 room. Expensive? You bet it is. Worth even half the price; don't even think about it.

If you want to just go back forth from your room to the pool or beach and have everything taken care of for you, this is the place. But it will cost you! Pros: -Service was great and attentive. It takes some getting used to that staff will carry your beach chairs, bring you towels, an umbrella, or a tasty frozen drink if desired. You can even have your lunch brought to you beachside or poolside. The $25 resort fee covers all this, except your food and drinks, which are extra. -Quiet. There were families with kids and even some type of corporate event going on when we were there, but our room was totally quiet, and we never felt bothered by anything else that was going on when we were outside. This place is nowhere near the bustle of downtown, and the beach is private, so it's very relaxed. -Everything is available from the hotel. They serve breakfast, lunch and dinner, or you can have room service. You can have a beachside massage. You can also rent a scooter, bike or Jet Ski, as well as sign up for fishing excursions from a kiosk on the property. Cons: -Meals and drinks are expensive on site. $10/drink if you want to sip a pina coloda by the pool, as I did. Room service and restaurant service are both equally expensive. Food is good, as are drinks. But we never had a meal that was under $40, for breakfast lunch or dinner. -Scooter/bike rentals, same as above. There was a place in town that would rent scooters for $25/day, it was $60/day from the resort, I believe. But then you have to somehow get back to the resort after you turn in your scooter, so I suppose you would spend what you saved on a cab anyway. -If you will be going into town a lot, this is probably not the best place for you to stay. I saw posting that you could walk back and forth from Duval, but it is a long walk, and not one that I wanted to attempt on days when it was 90 degrees. We would sometimes walk back in the evening, that was bearable. But once you include tip, most cab rides ended up being around $20, so you end up spending a lot on transportation. To Sum Up: My husband and I wanted to sit on the beach for a few days and not do much else, so Casa Marina was perfect for that, they catered to our every need.

Here are some of the key points I must emphasize: 1) The hotel staff was the most polished, professional and customer service that I have experienced. They blew the staff at the Ritz away, and they left a lasting impression. From the minor details of calling you, and pronouncing it correctly, by your last name to making sure that every detail was addressed, they were on top of it. Unfortunately, we were only able to stay two nights, but they were extremely helpful in making sure that our stay was perfect. In addition to being great, they did go above and beyond. I misplaced my BlackBerry and digital camera late Saturday night, and within 12 hours of noticing that it was missing, someone on their staff had located it and turned it into security's lost and found. They called that afternoon, and they arranged for shipping and both were back in my possession within 2 days. I was astonished by the integrity and honor of their staff to do this, and in this day and age it is unfortunately rare. This alone saved me decades of grief from my wife because our pictures would have been lost forever. 2) The whole experience of the property was wonderful. They had two pools that were well serviced by the staff. They were walking around all day providing drinks and food all day long. We didn't move for hours on Saturday, and they even walked through with free 'drinks of the day' (must try every one!) and also free popsicles to help stave off the 90 degree day. This was one of the few resorts that I saw with two pools, full service bars, and a beach. The whole place had a feel of Havana in the 20s, and they even had tons of hammocks between well matured palm trees. The rooms were perfect, but who really stays inside at Key West? 3) Food and drinks - absolutely the best mojito I have ever had. We got in at 4pm on Friday (drove from Miami) and all I wanted was a drink. We checked in, they took our bags to the room, and we headed to the bar. We got some apps and both had a mojito (handmade) and kicked back and looked at the aqua blue of the Atlantic and watched the sun start to set. We had some of their peel and eat shrimp, and they were some of the best that I have had. The next day we had breakfast served to the room, and were able to sit on our patio and take in the morning. Food was just good (not the best heuvos rancheros), but all in all not bad. Now lunch was a whole different story, we had a beer and I had the fish n chips, and she had the blackened sandwich. First the portions were ridiculously big, and the fish was hands down the best that I have ever had. I need the recipe for their breading as it was almost funnel cake like, and the fish was cooked to the perfect temperature. 4) Spa services - can you say couples massage on the beach??!?!? We didn't check out the rest of the spa, but what we got was perfect. The masseuse I had helped get rid of every knot in my body, and she took away every piece of stress that had been building for the past two years (two kids and a profession will do that!). My wife hadn't had a massage since she was pregnant, and said this was the best that she had ever had. 5) Romance - this place was so very quiet and the scenery was perfect for a romantic getaway. When we got back from Duval on Friday night there were flower petals throughout our room - I never ordered nor did my wife, so they were on their a-game to know this was a special weekend for us. Overall this was one of the best, if not the best, weekend getaway we have had. I can't think of a better place, with better service, with better amenities, or a better location than Casa Marina. Only thing that I would recommend is staying 5+ nights to enjoy everything that Key West and the Casa Marina has to offer!", "Date": "May 18, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "connecticut", "Title": "\u201cPerfect vacation spot\u201d", "Author": "wjsmks", "ReviewID": "UR63687545", "Content": "My husband and I stayed at the Casa May 6-8.

The room (island vista one bedroom suite) was very roomy and clean. Tthere was plenty of room to store clothing in the bedroom and personal items in the bathroom. Although the view was not the greatest, we enjoyed sitting out on the small balcony. The bed was very comfortable and we did not have any trouble with the housekeeping service. The room was made up promptly each day. All in all, for the money paid, this was a very nice resort in a very nice location.

The hotel was very nice, and perfect for our trip plan of a relaxing vacation. We relaxed by the pool or on the beach during the day. Most staff were very friendly and helpful. We were able to book excursions from the hotel, and were even picked up at the hotel for our snorkeling cruise. The pools were great, very clean, plenty of sun or shade (depending on your preference, and we adjusted often). The food at the breakfast buffet was really good (although we only had it one day as it was a bit pricey). The lunch menu was limited and pricey (as expected at a hotel), but allowed us to be lazy during the day. If you like massages, ask for John - he was fantastic! Only two complaints. One - the room walls were a little thin, so we could hear quite a bit going on in the room next to us. Two - it was at least a 20 minute walk to Mallory Square. We like to walk, but it was a little far (especially in the heat). We were able to easily (10 minute) walk to the conch or to the end of Duval Street (where we would eat breakfast). However, we had a car, so we just drove downtown each night, which worked out fine as there is plenty of parking (but bring plenty of quarters). Check the hotel's website for deals.

The only thing they need is a hot tub, how can they not have a hot tub? They have 2 pools and an awesome beach with 2 piers. Stayed in an ocean front ground level room that was very nice. Modern decor and walking out the patio to the ocean was a plus. Wish they had a way to lock the patio doors if you leave the room that way, but no biggie. Our room number was 110. They have a little store and a coffee shop. The breakfast and lunch was good at the beach bar and they have beach service to bring you food and drinks which was nice. They also have cabana boys that carry your lounge chair to your area on the beach. The food was good, priced like any other upper end hotel but not crazy. Bartenders were nice, there was one young lady at the bar that was awesome, however I forgot her name. If you are interested in renting any water sports, bikes or mopeds they have a place on site, however they are more expensive than other place in and around Key West. Their mopeds for the day were $70 and we found then a few blocks from the hotel for $40. All depends if you want the convenience of renting right at your door. Hotel staff was nice other than one assistant manager/ manager don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t remember his name either, however he acted and sounded like one of those annoying rich dimwits in the movies with the sweater tied around his neck. The best thing about staying here is the beach and the view, not good for sunsets or sunrises, however very pretty during the day. It is only a 5 min cab ride to Duval was $7 or $8 bucks.

We had such a great trip, from beginning to end! The staff was so friendly, accommodating and far from stuffy. The rooms were well appointed and very clean. The bed was comfortable, the closet was a good size. I have only good things to say! The resort grounds were maintained beautifully, with green grass, mature palm trees, and swept walk ways, which was a great thing when you walked through with flip flops on. The beach is one of the best, if not the best in Key West. The cabana guys were great! At noon they bring you the drink of the day and at 2:00 they bring you popsicles. What's better then that? Oh, and don't forget to tip them, they absolutely earn their tips! As far as the hotel restaurant goes, we did not have breakfast or dinner at the resort, but we did have lunch on the beach a few days. Everything we ordered was good. Oh, and don't miss out on the Key Lime Colada! Do yourself a favor and order one! Before I Forget, the location was great too! If you are someone who doesn't mind a walk to the main attraction (Duval Street), then you will love the location. It's far enough away that you don't have any disruptions at night, but close enough to take a great walk in the morning for breakfast! I think we took 3-4 mile walks every day. It was about a mile to Duval Street. At night, we would take a short cab ride to wherever we went to dinner, and we always ended up walking home. Probably because of the alcohol we consumed during the course of the night, but that's besides the point. The walking was a great way to come back from vacation and still fit in all of our clothes! Overall, we had a great time at Casa Marina and cannot wait for our next trip! This was our first time to Key West and we LOVED it! What an awesome town! One last thing...my husband was not entirely enthused about going to Key West, especially, since we drove from Miami. However, he has since changed his tune. The drive was SO much fun! I'm not sure I'd want to do the drive with kids, but as a couple, we had a blast. It's beautiful! And as for Key West, if you are having reservations, don't. The town is so awesome! There's so much to see, do, drink and eat! There are some outrageously AMAZING restaurants. If you are going and would like some of our favorites, I will be happy to give you recommendations!

We stayed at the Casa Marina which was a beautiful, clean and friendly resort. When we arrived our rooms were not ready so they told us to go sit outside at the bar and they took our cell phone number and would call us when the room was ready. It was just about 4:00 when we received the call. We went to the room and it was just beautiful. It was on a corner on the 3rd floor and was a Ocean View Junior Suite which had views of the Ocean and Pool. The balcony was really big and had a huge plant, table and 4 chairs. Our room had a sitting room with table and chairs, couch and coffee table and a longer buffet style table that held the TV, espresso machine, refrigerator and safe. We had a separate bedroom with another TV and huge closet to hang or clothes. The bathroom was a decent size and supplied all the toiletries we needed and plenty of towels. We ate breakfast at the resort twice. It was very good but I thought a bit pricey. I would suggest taking a walk up the street to the Deli or Duval where you can get a buffet breakfast for $8.00 instead of $21.00 a person. You could also order off a menu but even that was pricey as I got steel cut oatmeal with fruit for 9.00 a bowl. We always ate dinner in town so never tried the resort restaurant. Our first night we walked to Duval and just grabbed snack food at Sloppy Joes. It is about a 2 mile walk from the Casa but we never minded the walk or the sites. Sloppy Joes was a really fun place and when we were done grabbing a bite to eat we headed out and hit all the other favorite spots on Duval such as Irish Kevin\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s, Hogs Breath, Aqua (fun transvestite show) and had a blast at all! Our Second night we walked up to Duval Street to have dinner at Black Fin. We ate outside in the back area which is outside and the owner Michael was so nice and accommodating. He really went out of his way to please all of us. I had the pink shrimp and they were delicious. Everyone raved about their meal and all of them had a beautiful presentation. I would definitely suggest Black Fin to all who visit the Keys. We hit Willie T\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s after dinner and what a fun spot it was. Marcus the guitar player had us all up dancing and he played for 3 hours straight without a break. If you every go to Willie T\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s and Marcus is playing you are in for the time of your life. On Tuesday night we headed over to Latitudes to have dinner. This is another place you MUST do. It was such a beautiful place and the food was outstanding. You go to the Westin and get a boat pass which brings you over to a private island. The new Latitudes just opened a week before we arrived. It was simply beautiful and breathtaking. We had a table for 6 out on the beach and it was such a beautiful night. I would say do not go to the Keys and not have dinner at Latitudes. They even greeted us at the dock when we arrived. We spent most of Wednesday out on the water fishing for 6 hours. Captain Rob was an excellent captain and the 6 hours flew by. We caught a ton of groper, a shark and two 100-150 pound Tarpins. This was my first time fishing and I really had a great time and was happy I went. Captain Rob told us of a nice dinner place called Michaels where we can bring the fish and they will cook it up. It was off the beaten path of Duval but an excellent place to dine. We had a wonderful night at Michaels and apparently it is a place that many locals frequent but we were happy we found it and were able to enjoy the great food and atmosphere. Our last day we rented a golf cart and traveled around to see all the sights such as the southernmost point, Hemmingway\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s house, Key West Light house and Mallory Square. It was a fun day and we loved driving around in our 4 person golf cart. We rented it from Tropical rentals and we found they had the best prices if you wanted a moped or golf cart rental. I was sad to leave when the time came but certainly left knowing I would be back. The Casa Marina was absolutely beautiful and everyone who worked there was so nice. We enjoyed sitting at their bar and getting a drink before and after dinner. We would have a quick snack or lunch each day and enjoyed it very much. They made the best pina coladas and I really over did it. I would definately return to the Keys and the Casa Marina as well. I had a wonderful vacation but not sure if I returned well rested.

Plenty of parking. 2. Stay away from the island view suites, or rooms, it just overlooks parking and hvac units. Go for the ocean front, but make sure it faces ocean, not the pool with a peek at the ocean, that just isn't fair. 3. Breakfast albeit easy, wasn't worth it, go to Sarabeth's in town. Worth every penny. 4. if you are noise sensitive, ask for a room at the top level, and not an adjoining room if one exists. Trust me. REVIEW Waldorf Astoria? Aren't they built on \"creating customers for life\" they need a serious reality check. All staff members, including management, need to go back to hospitality school and retrain, and then train some more. Here are some examples of our stay. Check in: No one there at front door to assist. Because it was pouring, and the front walkway of tile was like stepping on ice. I went down a couple of times, no staff anywhere. Check in desk; Was supposed to get \"high floor away from elevator\" called the front desk twice to confirm this request before arrival, and was given ground floor right next to elevator/ice machine. Instead of suggesting something else, the woman at the front desk merely stated \"there were no more rooms she could give me\". So I politely suggested \"even if I upgrade?\" and then she, completely bothered, had to check, and found a semi-oceanfront room on the top floor albeit next to the elevator, but with a $50 a day increase in price. SOLD. I also booked the \"winter escape\" package, which she claimed was not so, and she never suggested that she assist me in finding out what happened, she just told me that I needed to show her in writing (which I eventually did) where I booked it. No apology. No one including reception asked to assit with bags, or suggested where our room might be. Which was out the door, to the left, through a cocktail paty wedding reception, elbow to elbow asking them to 'excuse me\" as I trudge to my room. Which was in the third building on the left. Room: One bedroom Ocean Suite- I have seen Ikea furniture look better than this. The furniture is clearly low quality and not comfortable, it was, badly beaten, and not very clean. No window opens except the slider to the balcony, so you were forced to have the a/c on regardless. Which was located in the bedroom which faced the pool and the reception of the wedding. Bathroom had one tissue left, very little toilet paper, and mold in the shower. No big deal. The lighting was terrible over the mirror, and there weren't any special touches, like a close up mirror, lighting over the mirror. Bedroom was just a bed and a tv with closet, nothing special, no personal touches or anything to make it feel cozy. Biggest downfall of the room was that if you had a neighbor, you could hear EVERYTHING through the double doors. This was not nice. Ask for a room without this feature if it is even possible. All four days we were here were clearly catered to large parties (wedding/business travel parties) and it showed. It was very noisy until at least 11:30 at night with party goers enjoying themselves, which is fine with me, as long as it isn't disturbing. Food: I had to send back two breakfast entrees. But we generally stayed away for food, too much to eat/see in town. Pool: At least during our stay....the other guests were pigs, who were here to drink and leave their crap blowing into the pool. The cabana boy was pleasant and couldn't be more eager to please you, which was refreshing. He was clearly overworked and was running a lot. The free drink of the day was pink lemonade and vodka, in a small sip cup. C'mon.......And the free popsicle at 2pm, was a joke as the staff had to fish out most of the wrappers from the pool 10 minutes later. Spa: I didn't partake, but it is oceanside in open cabanas, there is no spa here, so you are in plain view, and most likely a volleyball game is going on right next to you. Sounds relaxing right? Staff: Most seemed foreign. Nothing wrong with that, but they never greeted you, most looked down as you passed. All in all, this hotel has SO MUCH potential. They clearly need a better GM of this hotel to manage it properly. If they could upgrade furniture, standards of cleaning, and train staff to address issues with grace and poise they would have my repeat business. But for $400 a night, not including the \"resort fee\" with the \"Waldorf Astoria\" name, it just isn't worth it. I would rather stay at a Sheraton and pay half the price.

The Casa Marina was awesome! It's so beautiful. We probably wouldn't spend this much on a hotel on a normal vacation but we splurged for our honeymoon. It's one of the few hotels on the island that actually has a beach which was a big plus for us. It has two pools & neither were that crowded during the day. The beach was pretty large, very well kept, and the \"beach butlers\" were very helpful. Although the hotel is 100% smoke free our room smelt like smoke (because you can smoke on the patio) when we arrived but after keeping the patio door open with the AC on full blast it seemed to go away. The hotel is located on the South side of Key West so you'll do a fair amount of walking to get to the busy end of Duval, Mallory Square, or the harbor where most excursions leave from. So make sure to bring comfy shoes or plan on renting a bike or scooter (which is how most people get around Key West). We rented bikes from the resort which were $20/day per bike. You can probably get a bike cheaper from one of the many bike rental places on the island but it was jus easier for us to use the Casa Marina's. They pretty much don't have the internet. There are two computers for public use in the lobby but they are so slow after 10 min of not getting very far most people gave up. We heard other people at the hotel that had laptops with them that say they couldn't get a connection either. The Casa Marina is one of the Old Town Trolley stops which is nice. Neither parking or breakfast is included in the cost of the room. $15/day to self park, $20 for valet (plus tip of course), & $20/person for the breakfast ~ we never tried it so we don't know what it was like. The concierge was kind of a joke. He's only there Thur - Sun, but don't use him anyway. When we first arrived, we asked for his (Don) advice for food, we just wanted some appetizers for a mid-day snack. After being there for a while and trying all sorts of places, we realized his reccomendations were probably the last places I would tell somebody to go because there are so many other better restaurants. During the week, we used the \"Guest Services\" button on the phone, which is free, several times to make reservations and they were great, every reservation was made at the exact time and place we wanted. The people at the front desk also made reservations for us and were very helpful throughout our trip. If you're looking for coffee in the room, there is a Keurig style machine.

The bartenders know how to make an awesome Painkiller, and they have the nutmeg to do it. When I asked for after-dinner coffee to go, our server went to the Starbucks coffee shop in the main building (we were dining outside near the beach) and brought it back to order in a to-go cup.

The waiter checked on us once; we got our own food and drinks. Chef and wait staff at the pool cafe, friendly and accommodating; waitress at bar rude. Patrick and the rest of the front desk staff excellent. Housekeeping was rude. The first day we left the room at 7:30 and returned at 3:45 to shower and leave again. The housekeeping staff was socializing in the hall way. They watched us enter our room. At 4:00 they tried to enter. I asked that they give us 20 mins. we would be leaving soon. At 4:20 they knocked again. I asked for a few more minutes. At 4:25 she tried to enter again. I allowed them in the room and told them that we were early risers and they could clean our room early. She informed me that was not how their schedule worked. Needless to say their $5 tip went to $3. The next day they cleaned the room with my husband in it. For the first time I left no tip. The people at the watersports rental were rude. In fact we walked all the way to Moped Hospital to rent a scooter from friendly people. We did call Barefoot Billy's at the Reef Resort about jet ski rental and they were very friendly. Cosmetics The beach, pool and public areas amazing!!!!!!! Room, I have stayed at nicer Hampton Inns. The first day I went to put on the robe. It was stained and worn to the point of needing to be thrown away. I asked for a fresh robe and received two similar looking robes. I quickly discovered that the bath towels were in the same condition. This place has great possibilities. Someone needs to come in and over haul the rooms with contemporary chic not cheap chic and order fresh bath linens. They need to hire staff that is consistently service oriented.

No wonder it is so highly rated. Everything that was in its website came true, from the black and silver cypress ceiling in the airy and yet sophisticated lobby, to the pristine beach and our room. Upon entering the resort there was a relaxing aroma (would my guess of lemongrass be correct?), memorable view of the pool and ocean. I'm not sure what the combination is on your bedding, but I would bet Egyptian cotton? The history of Flagler dream was clearly relayed in the in-room book about the resort. We have returned to busy, and often stressful jobs and I find myself thinking back to our stay and feeling better - even though I'm not there!! There was only hesitation I have as to whether we would return and take family with us. This could hopefully be passed onto the Key West Chamber Of Commerce as it was pervasive through all the places we visited during our 4 day stay - 99% of the front line staff were caucasian. So very rarely did we see anyone of colour unless they were cleaning or maintenance staff. The Casa Marina have the very engaging, and professional Jafre-Paul as a bell-hop/front doorman and it is our hope that people like him are given a chance to advance if they so desire. I am caucasian and my husband is black. We found it very interesting that less than a mile away from the resort there is a great memorial to blacks rescued from slave ships in 1860, yet there is very little representation of equity in everyday life after 150 years.

On the other side of the room, in the living room area, was a window & sliding glass door that faced onto the somewhat dingy street---not a nice view!

Chocolates given at turn down service, and an expresso maker which was easy to use (unlike many other upscale coffee machines we've come across in other hotels). We dined in the hotel restaurant and food and service was lovely. The grounds are beautiful, very high end with access to the nicest beach in Key West. We only stayed for the one night, but I would come back for a longer stay. Only disappointment was the weather! It was unseasonable chilly, but that's not the hotel's fault!

Like almost everybody we spoke with, our stay was thanks to our HHonors program and associated points. Normally, the rooms are $300 and up. The views of the water, sun, and beach were breathtaking. The fashion in which the resort was laid out was very open and spacious. Customer service, cleanliness, and staff attentiveness were A-1 - I don't think I had to open a door the entire time I was there! There were plenty of poolside chairs, as well as chairs and air loungers on the beach. The fitness room had state-of-the-art equipment and had plenty of weights, machines, and treadmills. In my opinion, this is not a place you want to take your little kids - it's more of a quiet, relaxed atmosphere with limited kids' activities. Also, the prices of food and drink are a little high...$11 for a mixed drink, $13 for a burger, but hey, you are on vacation and are paying for the convenience. Self-parking in the lot was $15 per day, or you could valet for $20 per day. Or, you could find a spot on the street (user assumes all risks). We chose to go with the $15 per day. The resort is on the opposite end of Mallory Square, in a quieter neighborhood (sorrounded by $1.5M homes). It's about 2 miles that is easily (and safely) walkable. I do recommend you make a stop at \"touristy\" places like Sloppy Joe's, Hog's Breath, and A&B Seafood. There are two places that have exceptional Key Lime Pie...Kermit's Key Lime Pie Factory (across from the Conch Republic Seafood restaurant) and Kimberly's (on South street). If you put your pants on one leg at a time like most people, you HAVE to stop by B.O.'s for some great local seafood. It is near Elizabeth and Caroline. You will not be impressed with the \"curb appeal\", but you will love the food and \"character\" of the hole-in-the-wall shack. Make sure to stop by Mallory Square and watch the street entertainers (specifically, the Cat Man named Dominique).

The amazing view that could have been possible, were completely covered by the Palm Trees in the court yards.

The TV was so far from the bed in the smallest room I have ever paid $380.00 plus dollars on that there was no point in watching TV. Not to mention that shower head was so low in the shower that I had to bend over to use it.

From the moment I checked in, the staff treated me as if they did not need my business- and it was not what they did or did not do- it was how they did it. Upon check in I requested a king room instead of 2 doubles. The request was denied, but instead of saying I am sorry we don't have a king, I go a \"this is all we have.\" Then we were taken down a hallway with no lights to our room. It was a nice room, but my island view was a parking lot with broken curtains. I wanted to then go to take a dip in the hot tub- only to find out that the resort does not have one- again when I inquired no apology that this supposedly great resort lacks a basic ammenity. When I wanted to check out, I requested a late check out. The phone rang about 20 times before it was answered and then I was put on hold and forgoten. When I called back to make the request,.... yep you guessed it....I was denied again. The wording was, \" we have so many checkin in and out I can't do that, but you can use the resort,\" in a condescending tone. Finally- the worst was that I left a few shirts in the room that were nicely pressed on hangers. A couple hours after I checked out I realized that I did that and called the lost and found to report the issue. No one answered. The message is.\" leave a message and we will get back to you within a few to 24 hours.\" What if I had a plane to catch? Not wanting to wait for this process, I returned to the hotel to collect my shirts and they were wadded up in a bag. I expressed frustration and the employee ( again with the tone) says, \" you did leave them in the room right?\" None of this is 4 star service. In fairness, the hotel is beautiful.

The resort is an historic landmark with accommodations that are modern and comfortable. I also agree with reviewers who said that the housekeeping schedule is inconvenient. After a morning of exploring or relaxing by the pool or the beach, I sometimes wanted to come back to my room for a nap. I put the Privacy sign on my door, but housekeeping would call at about 4:30 to ask about cleaning the room. This should be done in the morning, or at least by 1p. I also think that the resort fee is ridiculous. It does not provide much of value except internet access and the fitness center. Who needs free phone calls when they have unlimited cell phone minutes? In-room coffee, refrigerator, beach activities, newspaper, pool chairs, etc., should just be expected in a Waldorf property that charges the rate it does. If anything should be included in the fee that isn't, it's the use of bikes. It cost twice as much to rent a bike at the resort as it did from Moped Hospital a few blocks away.

This is a lovely property that feels miles away from the all night parties of Duval. The main hotel building was a little smaller than I expected, but has been recently renovated with lovely furnishings. I was a little disappointed with front desk staff and the bellman. They were all very young, and although they were pleasant, they did not have the level of customer service as you would expect from a Waldorf property. We stayed in a king room with an ocean view. The room was lovely, but small. The bathroom was just ok (no bathtub and the shower tiles seemed dated). The balcony had a nice sliding door from the room and a great view of the property and the palms along the beach. The balcony is one long balcony the runs the length of the building, but they have made the individual terraces relatively private with screens. From our second floor room we could not see much of the water, even though we were facing it, as they have large palms lining the beach, but it was a beauiful view. The property became quiet earlier into the evening than I expected, even with 2 weddings going on at the hotel that evening. We spent hours on that balcony, as the property is lit at night, and with the sound of the water.... ahhh. The walkway to the water, with the ponds lining it is out of a magazine. This property has a dock, and a very nice beach - but those who have never been to the keys needs to be aware - this is not a \"sandy beach.\" They have put out sand, so it is easy to lay out, but the waters edge is very rocky. But the resort built entrances to the water for those who really need to get into the ocean, and they have 2 pools (but sadly - no hot tubs). One odd thing was that we had to walk outside the main building to get to the building that our room was in. Not a big deal, as it was a short walk - but no one offered to talk our bags for us. Then, when we got to the elevator, it was so slow (It was ALWAYS slow) and the second elevator was broken. Not a \"five star\" feeling. The morning when we left, it was pouring rain, so we again had to take our bags back to the main building to check out, and there was no way to escape getting a little wet.

My husband and I enjoyed a \"babymoon\" 1/8-1/12, I am 7 months pregnant. It's my 5th trip to Key West. Our room was huge and well appointed, room 1013 East Wing Island Vista One BR suite. We were on the first floor, and had views of the public beach and tennis courts and a nice balcony. The bathrooms were very spacious, though it only had a shower not a tub. Loved the espresso machine, and the two flat screen TV's, in the living room and in the bedroom. The bedroom had a comfy king sized bed, and was in a separate room with its own door for privacy. The main room also had a large L-shaped sofa and even a dine-in area. The only negative about the room is that it needed a fresh coat of paint, furniture needed scratch repair and the draperies/rugs needed drycleaning, surprising for a Waldorf Astoria. In spite of this, the room was super clean, the housekeeper did a great job keeping the room spotless and refreshing our towels. I was also disappointed that the spa did not offer mani/pedis. The hotel breakfast buffet was yummy, we enjoyed it every day. We had dinner at the resort once and it was excellent, one of the best dinners on the island. Service was good but slow (typical Key West). The resort had everything you could imagine, two grand pools, pool service, a beach, a nice pier, amazing views, watersports, spa, etc. Frequent travelers to Key West know that the beach space is limited. This hotel actually had a nice sized private beach and pier, a rare find at most KW hotels. Keep in mind the hotel charges an extra $20 a day resort fee. The weather became so cool during our stay, we could only used the resort on one of the days but still had to pay the pool fee every day. My husband loved the hotel but prefers to stay on Duvall Street, because the walk downtown was long for a pregnant lady (30 minutes each way) but we just grabbed a cab if we needed to. We have stayed at the Ocean Key in the past but I wanted a more of a resort experience this time. The resort is so beautiful, I thought it would be a great place for a destination wedding!! I would definitely stay there again or recommend it to a friend. PS: Make sure to leave time in your schedule for a visit to the Audubon House.

We wanted to relax in the sun by day and shop/dine in the evening. The temperatures reached record lows during our stay but we were fortunate to have booked a Grand Ocean room with a huge protected balcony. Truly, the balcony was as big as our room. We spent every day on the balcony lounging on the two chaise lounge chairs and managed to be warm and content with a fabulous view. Our room was not ready when we checked in so we stored our luggage and headed to Duval Street. The hotel notified us by cell phone by mid afternoon that our room was ready. After getting our keys at the front desk, we retrieved our luggage from storage. No one offered to help us with our many groceries and luggage which I thought was odd but we made our way to our room. I was not happy with our room as it was on the end and had a smaller balcony but we were quickly moved to the room next door which was great. This is an old hotel so they have to work with what they have so expect a room no bigger than 350 square feet and a bathroom that holds only one person....barely. I was pleased with the empty fridge for our groceries and the nespresso machine. i was surprised that there were absolutely no drawers for storage. We didn't bring much so it was fine. Ron, the concierge, was fabulous. There is no question he cannot answer. The staff at the restaurant where I picked up lunch daily (very good) to take to the balcony was wonderful. Absolutely no complaints about the staff other than the initial bell hops. There were numerous employees constantly cleaning the hallways, lobby, stairs, bannister, hedges, etc. I have never seen such care taken to the common areas both inside and outside. What surprised me, however, was the inconsistent housekeeping. There was a notice in the room that you could schedule housekeeping to come at a specific time so I called and requested noon since my daughter is a late sleeper. I had to call every day by 1:00 to request service. One day they forgot to leave a floor mat in the shower (a necessity I assure you) and another day they did not refill the coffee. On another occasion I was asked if I wanted the sheets changed. i asked when they were changed last and she had no clue. Housekeeping was truly the only shortcoming. It is a beautiful property and I would return and book this type of room only. Half the rooms are on the back of the hotel and many facing the ocean only have a window or very sheltered tiny balcony.

We initially liked the king-size bed in our suite, but during the first night we realized that every time one of us turned over, we were both woken by a loud clanging noise. We concluded that the bed was defective and the next morning, we reported it and were assured that Engineering would take care of it. We suspected that it had not been repaired, and sure enough we couldn't sleep on the second night either. When we asked at the front desk on the second morning, they admitted that they had done NOTHING the previous day!!! After we kicked up a bit of a fuss, they again assured us it would be repaired. This time, Engineering did come in, and were supposedly coming back. We don't know if they did because we went out for the rest of the day, but we do know they failed again. When we came back later and tested the bed, we quickly determined that it was still defective. I decided to take matters into my own hands and removed the mattress and box springs. I discovered that this bed is supported by a metal frame similar to the cheap ones you get for free when you buy a mattress set. The legs in the center were about half an inch off the floor, so they banged on the floor every time someone moved on the bed. Being surrounded by a hollow metal box, this generated the terrible noises we had been suffering. There were a few wooden shims lying around the legs, so apparently this is not the first time this has happened. (I presume they are dislodged by the housekeepers, although judging by the dust, they don't clean under there very often!) In five minutes, I had replaced the shims, and we think the bed is fixed.

The room was very nice and very very clean. (The \"view\" left much to be desired-dumpy houses, but again, no complaints because we didn't pay extra for an oceanview.) There is a mini-fridge in the room, which was nice to keep stocked for breakfast and snacks. Don't even bother going into the little store in the lobby- it's beyond overpriced. We went to a little convienence store a couple of blocks away. We spent time on the beach and at the pool, both of which were nice. There's a beach volleyball court, but we didn't see it being used at all while we were there. The hammocks on the beach were fantastic! It wasn't crowded at all while we were there, but early December is a pretty slow travel time. If you're a \"beach person\", then Key West might not be the best option. The beach at the resort was ok, but it's not a picture perfect, white sandy beach. It's manmade and there are alot of rocks and seagrass. The pool was nice though, and the beach is still very pretty and nice to relax and enjoy the view. There was a little watersports center right at the resort. We rented bikes, which was a fun way to see the island. You could also rent scooters, kayaks, wave runners, etc. The Casa Marina was about a mile walk from the busy part of Duval Street. We walked down for dinner each night, which took about 20 min or so, depending on how far down we went. I would definitely recommend all the places we had dinner- The Blackfin Bistro, Blue Heaven, and Mangoes. They were all really good, but Blue Heaven was my favorite! Food in Key West is quite expensive though. The highlight of our trip was going to Dry Tortugas National Park. It was so gorgeous!! We booked our trip through the hotel for $160/person.

We went snorkeling and walked around the fort. There's a very pretty beach too. Make sure you walk up to the very top of the fort- the view is amazing! The trip was expensive, but worth it. It was our favorite day of our vacation. If you are prone to motion sickness, invest in some less-drowsy Dramamine!! I still didn't feel very good, but there were some people that were in pretty bad shape. It helped to be sitting outside and looking at the horizon. Keep in mind that it's a long boat ride- 2.5 hours. If you are thinking about going to Key West, you won't be disappointed with the Casa Marina! It was beautiful and the service was great! We probably won't return to Key West because there's other places we want to visit, but we're glad we went and loved the Casa Marina.", "Date": "December 27, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "2", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "1", "Location": "3", "Rooms": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Grayton Beach, FL", "Title": "\u201cDon't waste your money\u201d", "Author": "jennaplum2", "ReviewID": "UR51580757", "Content": "I was extremely disappointed, booked a suite and had to be transferred to a room in the historic building, the suite was so sub-par.

The staff was accommodating in switching our rooms and letting us drop a night off our stay due to our unhappiness. The most upsetting part is that I feel the photos on their website are extremely deceptive in representing the rooms, espically the suites. Everything is several notches less luxurious than it appears on thier site, and yet you have the high price tag associated with a classier, more exclusive boutique hotel. Casa Marina Resort is NOT a boutique hotel. Other than this deceptive portrayal, it's fine, but not special. Other noted complaints: bathrooms are beyond tiny and definitely not updated (again, deceptive website photos) and their is a sickening smell of peppermint air freshener that permeates the rooms and halls. In the case of the \"suite\" it smelled as if it had been shut up with no ventilation for months.

We were in the Suites wing, staying in a one-bedroom suite with a pull out sofa (if I had to do it over again, we'd have picked the two-bedroom, two-bath suites in the same wing. Sharing one bathroom with 3 women was insane.) Although the rooms are on the smaller side, they are nice and adequately furnished. I was told the hotel was built around 1920 with a communal toilet down the hall. Adding bathrooms to each room drastically cut down the size of the rooms. Seems plausible. The built-in mini-fridge is almost a joke, so don't plan on keeping anything cold more than a few soda cans. Although the maid service was very friendly and serviced the rooms twice a day, I would recommend you ask in advance that they not knock any earlier than 10:00 am on rooms not checking out that day. Ours consistently woke us up at 9:00 am (we like to sleep in - this is a resort after all, right?) The resort itself is breathtakingly beautiful and well maintained. We rarely had to open a door ourselves and were always greeted with a genuine smile. I'd have to say that the friendliness of the staff was top notch, and all seemed very well educated, intelligent, and well dressed. Where we consistently felt the staff needed better training was in the wait service. Morning breakfast outside on the main porch under the palm trees could have been a dream. The view is spectacular, the air warm, the food excellent, and friendly smiles greet you from the wait staff. Enjoy that smile, because it will be the last time you see your waiter after s/he sits you for at least 30 minutes. Order an a la cart menu item instead of the self-serve buffet, and you may wait up to an hour to get your meal. It was this way every morning, whether it was Desmond serving you, or Ian, or John, or any one of the friendly staff members who come to work there from all over the world. There did not appear to be any shortage of wait staff for the relatively small number of people being served, so we could only assume it is a training issue. We never had lunch or dinner on the property, but I can assume the same issue would exist then as well. Unfortunately, it only got worse if you were waiting to be served by the pool or on the beach. From a business point of view, I shudder at the $$$ they're losing by not better training their wait staff. My family would have easily spent three times the dollars we actually spent on food and drinks (especially the latter) had someone regularly come by and asked us if we needed anything. Also, be forewarned, as I was, that you will pay $20/day as an amenities fee, and a minimum of $12/day for self- parking, or $20/day for valet parking. Self parking is a 30 second walk across the street from the front door, so being a vibrant 50+ year old, I chose that. On the whole, I would still recommend this resort to anyone thinking of a stay in Key West. The upsides outweigh any negatives. If you order the $19 breakfast buffet (highly recommend), you don't really need a waiter anyway. I learned quickly where the coffee decanter was located and really did not find it terribly inconvenient to get up and refill my own when needed. It also wasn't any more inconvenient to walk to the outside bar from the pool or beach to get a new drink. Sure, I shouldn't have had to do that in a resort like this, but I also was not going to let a minor inconvenience ruin an otherwise perfect vacation.", "Date": "November 27, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Waukee, IA", "Title": "\u201cNice stay at the Casa ~ will come back\u201d", "Author": "jawemer", "ReviewID": "UR50065122", "Content": "We took this trip just to get away and relax. Arrived Friday afternoon on November 20th, for a 4 night stay. We flew in to the Key West airport (EYW). I had called ahead and asked if there was a shuttle from the airport to the hotel - 'yes, of course' was the reply. We get our luggage and there is Caroline holding up a Casa and Reach Resort (another Waldorf/Hilton property just down the beach) sign. She mentions that the fee is $8/person. Uh... that was a disappointment - I'm paying $2200+ for four nights (+flight) and they're charging us for a 5 minute ride?? That didn't feel right. The shuttle is some \"... Transportation\" so not the hotel's vehicles but some company they outsource to. Anyway, we arrived at the hotel and we were greeted warmly by the valets and the door was opened for us. The lobby is nice and inviting (see first pic) - check-in was a breeze and we were directed to our room. I had selected a \"1 bedroom Ocean Vista Suite\" - when I paid for it I had requested a 1 King bed suite with an ocean view. Our room, #2004, had two double beds (they looked like doubles, at least - did not strike me as queens) and we had a great view of the pool but not so much the ocean (if you looked out and to the left you could see the ocean about 20-25m away - close but you could not be sitting on a chair and gaze out on the ocean. So, disappointment #2 (& #3 depending on how you look at it). Called down to the front desk and said they would look for another room for us. The room we were in was very clean, nice small balcony (smelled of cigarettes, though so that was gross), bath had a large glass shower (no tub) - there is a living area and separate bedroom - each with a LG LCD - they appeared to be 720p in 30\"-32\" range. Small fridge and a Nespresso espresso maker - this was nice (my wife preferred the Starbucks in the lobby area, though). None of the rooms at the hotel have any sort of kitchenette. Ron Casa did find another room for us while we were on the phone and said that he would have someone come up with the keys to the new room (#2010). After waiting for about 20 minutes no one had come up. I went down to the front desk to ask for the keys - Ron was helping someone else but the girl that was helping me did see that he had made the change and promptly made the keys for me. I went back to our new room and got in - King size bed (comfy) and a little better view of the ocean (still had to look out to the left, though) - so I considered those issues resolved. This room was not quite as clean but just in the living area and didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t see anything else - the two glass top tables in the living area had some sand/debris between the glass tops and the wood table underneath. There was also a piece of caramel corn visible underneath a cushion on the section of sofa closest to the balcony. This balcony did not stink of cigarettes but where was an ashtray out there. Rooms are non-smoking and no hint of smoke in either of the rooms we were in. Bathroom had a tub with a curved shower rod, one toilet, shelves to the left of the toilet that are lit from behind (kinda cool), and one wide sink with the faucet on the side. In room #2004 the closet was in the bathroom but in our newer #2010 the closet was accessible from the bedroom. Floors are tile and there is a bamboo-type floor covering in living room area. What is really nice about this room (and hotel) is that it is so close to the beach! (It is one of the few hotels that has any sort of beach - the Hyatt and Ocean Key on the north side, for example, have absolutely nothing). If we walk out our room and down roughly 10 steps you're on the beach! Beach is nice - a little rocky as you go out but plenty of sand to sun yourself and play on. There are PLENTY of lounge chairs and there was never a shortage. They don't lie all the way flat, though - didn't really bother me but to the hardcore sunbather this may be an annoyance. Small tables are also available. There are also several hammocks strung up between the palm trees. Water was a little cool but fine once you are in for a little bit (that time of year\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6). Lots of fish! By the piers you will see schools of fish and larger tarpon, as well. There is a bean bag toss (the game you see at tailgaters), bocce ball set, sand volley ball, and the Spa al Mare is on the beach, as well. From Casa Marina's beach you have access to two (2) piers - great for taking pictures on and viewing either the sun rise or sunsets. Small waves and not much of a tide (while we were there). During the summer you would not be able to see the sunset, though, and would have to go to the Mallory Square/North Duval area to view. Could still hear the waves breaking from our room - sounded very nice. Jim and Bob the Parrot \u00e2\u20ac\u201c Jim will be walking around with Bob. Bob is very tame. He\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll ask for a minimum $5 donation but says it goes to some wildlife fund. Pools (2) - I didn't get into the pool on the west side - the one on the east tasted a little salty but was refreshing. Again, plenty of lounge chairs were available when we were there and they do lay all the way flat. Sun Sun Bar - drinks are weak and expensive. A Pi\u00c3\u00b1a Colada or Rum Runner is going to set you back $9. Add a shot to the colada and it adds $3 (standard). But a $12 drink? Needless to say I never felt inebriated while imbibing at the resort. There are 4 ~20\" LCDs at the corners of the bar and Nate was happy to change the channel to the Iowa vs. Minnesota game for us on Saturday so don't hesitate to ask. On Friday night there was live music right next to the bar and that guy, playing an acoustic guitar, was pretty good. Also - this is not a \"party\" resort so it tends to be on the quiet side - lots of families/kids - there will be some music playing softly at the bar but you will not hear it at the pools or the beach. We ate at the bar as well as the Sun Sun Restaurant just across from the bar and the food came out quickly (it's made right there) - pricey but good (e.g., a Casa Club is $12 or Flagler Burger is $14 at the bar and the Tortellini at the restaurant was $26). A local recommended the Sunday brunch at the Casa Marina ($30) but we didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t get up in time of thatl. Watersports - we didn't do any of these and there didn't seem to be time for them anyway as we were doing a lot of site seeing. I did call about the jet skiing as we thought it would be nice to go around the island. It was $70 for a HALF hour and $110 for ONE hour. They had a 1.5 - 2 hour tour that was $120. It's been a while since I've rented a jet ski but that seemed a little exorbitant. You can also rent scooters, electric cars (those are everywhere down there!), and bikes. Room Service - ordered some food on our last night as we'd had an early dinner. Wife ordered a Flagler Burger and I had a sausage and mushroom pizza. Wife ordered her burger medium-rare and it came back a little too rare (the room service kitchen is different than the Sun Sun kitchen). Called about this and they took the burger off of our bill and offered to bring another one but declined. The pizza was good. The food came quickly, too (in about 20 minutes). There is a 20% room service charge + a $3.00 delivery charge (standard...). Maid service - heard a knocking at around 10am the first morning we were there and it was the maid. Not used to having them come that early and had forgotten to put the \"Do not disturb\" sign out. They did a good job and didn't worry about belongings (left a laptop, iPod, and cameras out). Cabs are cheap \u00e2\u20ac\u201c should only cost around$8.75 - $9.00 to get from the Casa Marina to the north side of Duval, Conk Republic Seafood Company, or Pepe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s (HIGHLY recommend Pepe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s for breakfast, at least!). Also had dinner at Blue Heaven and their key lime pie is homemade and delicious. I would *not * recommend taking one of the bike cab-things. They charge $1.50/minute and they pedal on their slowest (they pedal fast while getting nowher) gear possible. What would have been a $3.50 cab ride from the bottom of Duval to our hotel was a $15 bike cab-thing ride \u00e2\u20ac\u201c robbery. ALSO, I only took cabs with the wife \u00e2\u20ac\u201c I walked everywhere else and walking to the north side of Duval from the Casa Marina only took 25 minutes. They may say, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Oh, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 14 blocks!\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd but those are Key West blocks \u00e2\u20ac\u201c quite a bit shorter than a city block. We also took a cab back to the airport although it is the same price as the hotel\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s \u00e2\u20ac\u0153shuttle.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd We felt better about spreading the wealth than giving the hotel another $16 for a ride to the airport! There are several convenience stores nearby and towards Duval so can get wine, beer, pop, fruit & food quite a bit cheaper than at the resort. Fauston\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s grocery is on Fleming and can take out cash without a $2.00-$3.50 bank ATM fee. The Casa Marina\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s ATM will charge you $3.50 per withdrawal. The southernmost *public* point in the continental U.S. is just past the Reach Resort so only about 4 blocks to the west of the Casa Marina. The actual southernmost point (besides the piers at the Casa Marina) is on the Navy Station to which the public does not have access \u00e2\u20ac\u201c didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t know that before I went down there so kind of makes that southernmost point marker an embellishment.

The first time we fell in love with the views and the accessibility of everything. Very family friendly resort. I gave it 5 stars the first time. This time we left the baby at home and were looking for a nice relaxing get away, complete with massages. I contacted the hotel earlier asking if they had an indoor spa as we enjoy our massages in air conditioning along with the amenities that usually come from such a spa - particularly one that bills itself a Waldorf Astoria. I was told that they had a couples suite for massage and I should contact the front desk once we checked in to get directions to the spa. This is not a spa. It is literally a hotel room that they took the bed out of and replaced with two spa tables and candles. It is right on the road, so you could hear the cars traveling down the street. People were coming in and out of the room. The only thing that separated us from the main door was a curtain. At one point, someone came in and took a shower. There was no sauna, no whirlpool. I should have known that it was going to be a mistake when they told us to arrive 5 minutes before the appointment. The therapists were very good, however it was impossible to relax in that environment. After the massages I asked the therapists if they worked directly for the hotel and was told they were sub-contractors for a sub-contractor. Ran into the manager of the \"spa\" on our way back to our room and told her of our experience and she basically said that's why everyone chooses to do them outside.

You don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t expect a gang of thugs (two or more + uniformed police), not hotel staff, to stop you at the hotel entrance and demand identification. After some time explaining that you are not a part of the private group that the ruffians are representing, you are grudgingly allowed to pass, only to repeat the process at the other end of the lobby where you need to exit to go to your room. After complaining to the hotel management, they were powerless, and cowed by this organization that had rented out a portion of the hotel. No one said anything about this group function on reservation or on check in or offered any explanation on check in that would have at least alerted me, a full paying guest, of potential issues. I did find a printed notice in my room that informed me that parts of the grounds and facility were rented out to a private party and would not be available. When you rent a hotel room, you don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t expect to waste time coming and going, having to deal with non-hotel elements that treat you like you don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t belong since you are not one of their group and you don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t deserve to be poked, although inadvertently, with 2-way radio antennae, as you enter an exit a hotel.

After some thought, we wondered if the private function included individuals that needed such crowd control and a cadre of uniformed officers and were a little concerned for our safety. The hotel staff seemed to not be in control of their establishment. I can understand, and would support having a security detail for a private function to control access, but not to the hotel itself. I have, been to many private functions, where the function access was controlled. In fact, I attended one last month in Anaheim, at a Hilton property, where a former presidential candidate was behind me in line top check in. I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t think he would have suffered this indignation that was going on at the Casa, simply because he was not a part of the same function that I was attending. The property is very good for a beach resort, the secluded beach, pool and hammocks are delightful. The food was good, and by Key West standards, in line as far as price. We went for relaxation that we achieved, between the hassles of leaving and entering the hotel. The AC thermostat did not function, it was either ice cold or off. However, we would stay again, the property is that good, if we had assurance that the access, entrance and egress would not be an issue.

We were suppose to go to an all inclusive, but long story short, it didn't work out. We booked this on a Saturday and arrived on Sunday. Very short notice! They allowed us to check out the ocean front room first to see if we liked that room or if we preferred the pool view room. Well, as it turned out, the pool view room is the best!!! It has a little terrace with two lawn chairs and two other chairs that you can relax on and watch the pool. This proved to be excellent when our daughter was napping - we had her in the room, the monitor on, and we stayed out on our terrace and layed in the sun. When either of us got hot, we could walk 5 steps to the pool and take a dip. There was a crowd of people there for a wedding on the last two days of our trip, so it got to be very loud. This wasn't too much of an issue, but I could see it would get old if you had to put up with it all week long. The grounds were beautiful, the beach was a little to be desired but I only ever swim in the pool anyway (unless in bora bora!ha!). It was EXTREMELY HOT! Beware of that if traveling in August. It was a bit miseralbe to walk into town because you would just be dripping wet. But, we did the walk everyday. Because of the heat the pools were VERY warm. Not refreshing at all, which is a little disapointing. My husband and I were trying to think of something to invent and sell to the hotel so they could have a cold pool - but we came to the conclusion they just need to run new water into the pool each morning. We took our daughter to dinner almost every night. We also did hire a babysitter from an agency the hotel recommended. It was the best thing we ever did!!! I was a bit nervous - but the lady that came was a nurse at a local hospital and is the same lady they always use. She was perfect. That allowed my husband and I to have an evening out at the bars - which was SO fun!! The hotel restaurant wasn't that great - the food was ok (we just ordered at the restaurant and went and picked it up and ate at our table in the room), just very expensive. Everything seemed expensive. We typically shared lunch and then went out to dinner. For breakfast I would walk into town and pick us up some bfast sandwiches and fruit. Oh, they do a lot of nice things during the day by the pool, which was a nice touch. Drink of the day, ice washcloths, popcycles (the best I've ever had). All in all it was a great trip. Our daughter was very happy in her crib and even though her schedule was completely off, she did very well. If anyone is thinking of traveling with their child, the pool room set up worked very well for us. We also brought a litle float with a canopy for her to float in the pool. This worked like a charm b/c she loved it and she would fall asleep in it from the motion in the pool, so we would take her out and let her take a nap. We enjoyed our stay - however, would have probably only stayed 5 nights instead of 7. Just too hot! Oh, one last tip. There was a bit of construction the week we were there as well as constant trimming of shrubs (why didn't they use hand clippers instead of electical??).

Booked through Alpharooms.com & paid \u00c2\u00a3370 (not including Resort Fee of $20+tax per night). First off, can i just say how hard it was to find decent accomodation in Key West for less than \u00c2\u00a3100 per night. It was really, really hard! So when i came across this hotel for this price i jumped at the chance. Turns out we were in town at one of the busiest times of the year in Key West, the annual Key West Poker Run, where around 10,000 bikers from all over the country descend on Key West for a weekend of fun & raising money for charity. It certainly wasnt the quiet, relaxing time we had envisioned, but we went with the flow & had a great time anyway! Self-parking or valet parking was available at the hotel, but i had read on previous reviews that parking was available on the street, due to the hotel being in a residential area. So we parked on the street, no problems at all. The hotel itself was lovely. Big, spacious, clean & elegant. There was always staff cleaning mirrors & buffing the floors & keeping the place spotless. The concierge introduced himself & was friendly. The room itself was really nice. It looked exactly like the pictures on the hotel website & was clean & comfortable. The shower had good water pressure & there was plenty of fluffy towels & nice products in the bathroom. We had a large flatscreen TV with plenty of channels to watch, which was ideal for us, as the weather was so hot, we had to sit indoors with the A/C on watching a film until it cooled down outside! The outdoor areas is where the hotel truly shines. There is two identical swimming pools with plenty of seating available. I had read on previous reviews that ice-lollies & cold towels were given out at the pool, but i never saw this. Maybe i was watching a film at the time! The pool guy saw that i had brought my own beach towel to the pool & told me not to bother next time as there is plenty of towels available for guests to use. There is also a bar area outside & a dining area. I had the mango chicken sandwich & fries (around $13) & it was delicious. Our server, i think his name was Darran?, was really friendly & polite. The hotel is in a quiet location in Key West, away from the hustle & bustle of Duval Street. It was a good 15-20 minute walk to the main strip, which suited me just fine.

As a previous reviewer noted it's a young, hip hotel that has a wonderful history. I won't bore you with too many details about a good choice for Key West. If you're a student, party animal or looking for a low-key guest house this is not the place for you. But if you're a couple, or in my case a solo dad traveling with a 7-year-old, you've got a nice hotel to use as a base while exploring what there is to explore in Key West. It has two identical, wonderful pools, set amid beautiful palm trees. It's on the beach, or what passes for a beach in Key West, which is a little sand and a rocky access point. The hotel has a nice pier which goes a way out, with stairs, for access to the water. You'll find a fair amount of seaweed, but hey, that's the Florida Keys. The staff is warm, accomodating, friendly and highly professional. It's a hip place but that doesn't mean pounding discos and a party atmosphere. I was very pleased by the lack of music poolside. Sometimes I just want to totally relax, listen to the beach and not have to listen to Caribbean music, Jimmy Buffett or other resort-themed music. The hotel reeks of history and why it's been renovated into a modern hotel is another topic for another time. I'm sure historians are freaking out at the modernization of this hotel and I'll leave it for the architects and history buffs to debate whether they've done the best thing for the public spaces of this classic hotel. Our room was modern, the beach views wonderful and had absolutely no complaints about anything at this hotel. There's a bike, boat and moped rental place at the hotel and there is also a paid shuttle service to the airport. The taxi ride, all of five minutes, will cost you a shocking $16 (two passengers @ $8.00 each) from the airport. I'm from NYC and a lengthy car service or cab ride to or from the airport, as of this writing, will cost you about $40. A metered cab ride in NYC for an equivalent journey would have cost $5.00 tops. If you're a newlywed, a couple or traveling with kids this is a great choice for Key West. Just wish I'd been able to afford it a lot earlier in life, although certainly can't complain at the roughly $150 a night rate that we got shortly after Labor Day. As others have pointed out, and the Hilton website makes abundantly clear, there is a $20 per room \"resort fee\" attached to your stay. Why they just don't jack up the room rates by $20.00 and skip the \"resort fee\" is beyond me. All in all a memorable holiday, my kid loved the beach, the boce ball, the volleyball and the pools. I'd definitely recommend this place.", "Date": "September 13, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "New York", "Title": "\u201cMost relaxing and enjoyable vacation.....\u201d", "Author": "angel193", "ReviewID": "UR41378846", "Content": "We found the staff to be friendly and most helpful with everything we needed.

The resort is located in a residential area, so surrounding noise and congestion is virtually nonexistent. Although it requires at least a moderate walk to get to the best restaurants and the popular areas of Duval Street, it seems to one of the few resorts on the island with beachfront access. With two spacious pools, an outside bar and food service, large sections of beach that are well shaded by palm trees, and a small dock from which you can enter/exit the ocean with ease, you will be hard pressed to find another location in Key West that will allow you to enjoy the naturally relaxing aspects of the island as well as this one. On the final day of our trip, we never once left the resort and instead opted to enjoy the sunshine, alternating between the pool and the beach. This added an aspect of enjoyment to our vacation that we would not have had had we stayed in a B&B or in a hotel with no beach access. SMALL ANNOYANCES BEYOND THE HOTEL STAFF'S CONTROL: The beach itself is relatively small and very rocky, so if you expect plentiful beach sand, wide open spaces, and swimmer friendly shoreline, you will probably be disappointed. There is a dock that extends past the rocks with stairs down into the water, so the hotel does make the best attempt it can to overcome this. But still, it's just not quite the same. In addition to a rocky shoreline and ocean floor, there is an incredibly high amount of seaweed in the water. The staff clears the seaweed that washes ashore, but you will still find the ocean floor literally covered with it should you decide to take a swim in the ocean. Also, the beach area as well as all the other common areas tend to get quite crowded, especially on the weekends. CONS: By far my biggest complaint is the rooms. While they are perfectly clean and tastefully appointed, they are simply too small and offer insufficent ammenities. Before it was part of the Waldorf brand, the Casa Marina was owned by the Blackstone Corporation under their luxury hotel brand LXR. After Blackstone purchased Hilton (which owned the Waldorf brand), they moved all of their LXR resorts to the Waldorf platform. And as far as the rooms go, they unfortunately just fall a little short of the Waldorf brand standard. While larger suites are available, the standard rooms are certainly no bigger (and perhaps smaller) than rooms of the same category at budget hotels. And although the decor and fixtures are very appealing, there are no more comforts than you would find elsehwere in less \"luxurious\" brands. Inland facing rooms have absolutely no blacony, and none have a coffee makers unless you specifically request one. Presumably, this is to encourage patronage of their sundry store, which just so happens to sell brand name coffee. But when a resort of this caliber sacrifices customer convenience for the obvious purpose of trying to make an extra buck, it leaves a pretty sour taste in one's mouth. Additionally, the resort adds a mandatory $20 per night fee to their advertised rate for things like poolside wait service, towels, hammocks, beach chairs, weekday newspapers (which we never received), etc. I readily admit that having these ammenities is invaluable, and I would most definitely not be pleased with having to pay for the extra services a la carte. But since all guests are forced to pay this extra fee, it seems that charging it as an \"add on\" instead of simply including it in the base price serves only to allow them to advertise a lower room rate than what is actually charged. My last point of contention: parking. The Casa Marina charges $20 per day for valet parking and $12 per day for self parking. Being located in a residential district means that there is ample street parking that is perfectly convenient, and charging for parking just seems like yet another attempt to milk as much money from you as they can. Bottom line, if you're looking for a place where you have the option of simply enjoying the abundant sunshine and relaxing in the views and sounds of the ocean without ever having to leave your hotel while still being close enough to the heart of Key West, you won't find a better property or a more professional staff.

Also there are free coolers with iced water at the poolbars, which was a nice touch not having to constantly run to the bar buying expensive beverages to the children. The rooms are also great - we ordered an ocean view room and had one with exactly the most beautiful view at the beach and ocean.

The prices are quite reasonable keep in mind you are staying at these beautiful surrondings \u00e2\u20ac\u201c we were having dinner at the beach actually tabled in the sand, watching the moon rise above the ocean, with nice and observant waiters and paid only above $ 100 for 2 adults and 2 kids.

When you take all the free stuff you are treated with at the pools into account, the self-parking etc. this is definitely reasonable. Coming directly from Miami beach with extreme prices on average hotels, drinks and valet parking we were certainly very pleasently surpriced.

We had been to the Boca Raton Resort from the Waldorf Astoria Collection the year before and simply loved it but boy, what a difference! For starters, there\u00c2\u00b4s a $20 daily fee to cover for ammenities as the hammocks (the most expensive in the world, I guess) and other stuff. If you don\u00c2\u00b4t get to the hammocks early in the morning, forget it. There are not enough for all guests! I suppose, then, that the $20 only allows your presence in the swimming pool, because all other activities were paid. They even charged $5 dollars - yes, FIVE dollars, for a wine tasting. The website says it covers refreshments, which is a blatant lie, since we had to pay for every single thing we had. And you had to go to the swimming pool simply because the beach has no sand in it, only rocks. They built a pier so that guests could reach the water, but frankly, it was disappointing. Lots of people confined in one spot in the sea. Parking costs $12 if you park it yourself across the street, and we decided to pay $20 for the valet in the hopes they would park it under a kind of shelter, since the summer in Key West hits high on the 90\u00c2\u00b4s. No way Jose - for 20 bucks your car is roasted under the sun, day in, day out and you simmer in it while waiting for the AC to take effect. Service is non-existent. They charge you and that\u00c2\u00b4s it. When we arrived, I took hold of a map and asked the valet where we were in the map. After 3 minutes of not so funny jokes, he confessed he couldn\u00c2\u00b4t read a map!!!!!! Breakfast is a joke - even though there were eggs cooked any style you wanted, bread was not fresh and there was not a variety of choices. There were 3 kinds of fruit, and not so many choices of jelly or cold cuts. Obvioulsy, breakfast also costs $15. Not to mention they don\u00c2\u00b4t have a restaurant. The only meals they serve are in the slim pool menu. I had a BLT and a beer and my partner also had a sandwich and a beer. The check? 56 dollars. FIFTY-SIX DOLLARS for 2 SANDWICHES AND 2 BEERS! Oh, yes! And they charge you for wi-fi in the room!!!!!!!! I don\u00c2\u00b4t remember how much but it was kind of 11 dollars.

However, the customer service at Casa Marina is far below what should be expected at a luxury hotel. Everyday room service would not clean our room until late afternoon (2pm or later). When I called to ask housekeeping when they would be able to clean my room they responded by saying they \"do not provide guarantees when rooms would be cleaned\" and could not provide any timeframe. We were staying in the all suites building and paying top dollar for our room. I can only imagine the lack of customer service received in the non-suites building. Additionally, we had an issue with an amenity arranged by the concierge. When we spoke with hotel management about the issue they were rude, incompetent, and unforgiving. After speaking with several managers over the incident, the hotel rooms manager finally agreed to provide us with a resort credit comparable to the amenity. When we went to check out the resort credit had not been applied to our bill and the front desk manager said no notes were made on our account about any credits. Eventually, we were able to get the credit, but it was only after much aggravation. The hotel management made us beg and fight to receive something promised to us as a result of their error. By far this was the least enjoyable experience I have ever had with hotel management. Overall the picturesque views and food made this a great trip.

The company decided to treat all 27 managers, avps, and vps of the Florida region and their wives/girlfriends to the keys, and for some reason, chose these accommodations. To make the drive and stay more enjoyable, my boyfriend and I checked in a night earlier than the rest of the group. Check-in went smoothly until we arrived at our room. Right away I was very disappointed by the room size. The room was very tiny, had no coffee maker, a very small refrigerator, and did not have a dresser to put folded clothes in to. In any case, I did my once over check to find an absolutely disgusting bathroom. There were used towels on the sink and the trash contained tissues and used feminine products from the previous guest. My boyfriend went to the front desk immediately to get a room change. After seeing that the room change would provide us with an even smaller room, we requested that the staff come clean the room we had originally checked into. The two female staff members that I encountered were beyond rude. One asked \"What's wrong with the bathroom?\" I told her it was dirty, showed her the towels, and explained the trash can issue. She then responds, \"Well, what do you want me to do?\" I thought I had made that blatantly obvious that her purpose for that room was to clean it, but I guess not. The following day, the rest of the couples with the company checked in. I spoke to other couples about our problems with the room and found that 7 other couples out of the 27 that had arrived found their rooms dirty and asked for a room change. One couple opened up their room to find two unmade beds and a baby's pack-n-play. Another couple found their room to have unmade beds as well. One couple encountered so many bugs in their room that they almost left the function all together. Some couples had dirty towels, dirty bathtubs with hair stuck to the side, and even used hotel shampoos in their rooms. Every time someone tried to change their room, they heard the same thing I had heard...\"We are sorry... This never happens.\" I get the feeling that is not the truth. Upon check-out the following day, my boyfriend and I had more issues with the \"resort.\" The staff at the front desk was beyond incompetent. They tried charging the company for the extra night that we had stayed which we had to pay for. My boyfriend explained that the extra night was to be charged to his credit card and not the company account. The woman behind the counter said there was nothing she could do. She went to get another woman to help solve the situation and came back to say \"This is your lucky day. We should be able to take care of this.\" This is your lucky day?!?! These people must be kidding me!!! It was our lucky day that they could correct a mistake that they made? Ridiculous. For the inconvenience, the hotel did give us a discounted rate for the extra night. No number of discounts could make up for the horrible experience we had.

The lobby is extremely nice and reminded me of the Ritz Carlton at Reynolds Plantation with rich dark woods and soft white textiles. The staff was nice and check in was a breeze. The hotel is a lot smaller than the other Hilton resorts we have stayed at and had a quaint, upscale feel. When we got to our room, it smelled like smoke. I went to the front desk and they said all the rooms were supposed to be non-smoking. They moved us to a different room and it smelled fine- really not a big deal. The rooms themselves are large and comfortable. We liked the hardwood floors and furnishings. The flat screen TV was nice as were the beds and linens. The bathrooms were really neat with ultra modern fixtures and a frosted window in the shower that opened to the outside normal window. If you want a tub, you're out of luck. Also, there were some stray ants crawling around, but it wasn't a major infestation. The hotel is on the water, but as with most of Key West the beach at the hotel isn't like a Florida beach. It is a rock coast with a pier that sticks into the water for swimming. The pools look small for a resort hotel, but it is all very nice. There are multiple hammocks along the water front that are great! We loved laying in one and could have almost slept outside that night. The stars were beautiful. The location of the hotel is average. It's on the southern edge of Key West. We walked all the way up and down Duval Street and it's a bit of a hike. We didn't mind, but depending on the breeze and temperature, you might want to consider a cab. The hotel charges a \"resort fee\", which is a load of crap. I think it's a way to make hotel prices look more competitive when price shopping then they stick you with additional fees. Along the same lines, there is no reason to pay $20/ night for parking. The streets around the hotel have plenty of free parking (at least for the Friday night we were there). Overall, I would say this is an excellent hotel, but only an average value. The rate for our stay would have been almost $400/ night if I did not use points, and this is not a $400/night hotel. It's more like a $250/night. If you get a rate for $250, I think you'll be very happy, any more than that and the appeal diminishes.", "Date": "June 3, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "2", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "boston", "Title": "\u201cBeautiful but disapointing\u201d", "Author": "drjeff", "ReviewID": "UR31441059", "Content": "I recently stayed here for 4 days for a meeting.

What sealed it was the size of their \"beach\" and the beauty of the property. I considered the Pier House, The Hyatt and few other top properties but it was the beachfront atmosphere that sealed it for the Casa Marina (being a little cheaper than the Pier House didn't hurt). Overall, the resort delivered on my expectations. First, the positives: - The grounds are beautiful. I have to say this is one of the few hotels whose pictures on their website are incredibly accurate. No pics from funny angles to hide potential eyesores or the like. I'm not going to bother with posting my pics since the other reviewers have done an exceptional job covering the resort. - The Beach: while not beaing a classic Florida/Caribbean beach, is excellent by Key West standards and runs the length of the hotel. The beach attendants are top notch and certainly do their best to make everyone comfortable & happy. BTW, ask these guys to send a waitress over rather than wait for one to come around. Tip these guys well! - The Pool: The two pools are nicely furbished with the added advantage of having one of the better poolside dining establishments I have experienced. Yes, getting a waitress poolside can be iffy at times but the dining area is so close it's not a big bother to walk up and ask for someone to come over. - The Beds: Pretty damn comfortable! - The Location - Being on the south side of the island made for a much quieter and peaceful experience (which admittedly was what we were after) and Duval was only a short walk/bike ride/taxi ride away. - Spa Services: We only opted for massages during our stay but the staff they had was excellent. Notice though that I say \"services\" as the resort does not have a Spa per se. the \"Spa\" is a renovated 1 bedroom suite with a limited number of options available. It is not a full service operation like that at the Pier House. If you are looking for a spa-type vacation you might be disappointed here. - Activity Center: Located right on the property they had just about every watersport available (for an extra fee) and bike and scooter rentals. Very convenient. I can't say there was anything about the Casa Marina that was a disappointment. More like minor quibbles that prevent me from giving it a five star review. They are: - The Ocean Vista rooms have an armoire rather than a closet. It's in the entranceway and it's proximity to the bathroom door makes opening both at the same time difficult. It also blocks the doorway when open. A questionable layout to say the least. - The service: I had both very attentive service and some slow service. A bit inconsistent but nothing I would guage as terrible. - Ocean Vista Rooms numbered 24 through 28 on any of the four floors have a balcony barely big enough for two regular chairs. Nowhere near as big as the other oceanview rooms. We were able to move but others may not be as lucky. Be aware that rooms on the 3rd and 4th floor stand a very good chnce of looking out at Palm trees! Shoot for a room on the first or second floor. - Concierge service: Nothing overly fancy. The concierge can give recommendations for dining and sightseeing options but they only seem to be at the desk from 9-5p. No hours are posted. All-in-all I would recommed the Casa Marina with little hesitation.", "Date": "June 1, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "3", "Location": "3", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "brooklyn", "Title": "\u201ceverything and everyone were top shelf\u201d", "Author": "jolynkitch", "ReviewID": "UR31236555", "Content": "the rooms and the views were great, but the staff were the best. aboslutely a wonderfull experience", "Date": "May 31, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Bath, ME", "Title": "\u201cjust right\u201d", "Author": "swimvacation", "ReviewID": "UR31120637", "Content": "Nice place.

The place had the old world charm with modern amenities. This was our first time in Key West and just loved the history, architecture and vibe. We could stay there forever. The hotel is flawless in regards to location, history and the architecture. We pretty much stayed on grounds except to dine out. More on that later... The pool is very clean and has the perfect view of the Ocean. It's very family friendly. We have a one year old daughter and one of her highlights were the pool. There were also many families there with their children... But we saw couples, older and young, group of singles, weddings galore (saw 4 this weekend) and it all blended in together. Hammocks were probably my favorite part... I literally swung in one for at least an hour. The beach chairs are nice. could be more cushy but it comes with towels. The service at the pool and the beach was scarce. I think one server had both area, so it was a bit slow... so definitely have patience. The pool does offer resort-like activities like cocktail social, ice cream social, and offers services like popsicle and drink of the day. A definite perk in my eyes. Their attention to service is top notch. The staff was incredibly helpful and kind throughout our entire stay. The only drawback is the food. For a Waldorf-Astoria, I had hoped for a better restaurant than the one they had. Being a foodie and having eaten at many top restaurants in NYC; it was a bit disappointing. I hope that in the future, Casa Marina will build upon their food and beverage dept because I found that sorely lacking. We dined out most of the time except a snack at the beach and breakfast buffet the day we left. However, all the wait staff were wonderful and hospitable. Another drawback I saw was the internet usage charge and parking charge. Since they have a resort fee of $20; I would hope that it would be included. And they don't offer childcare service like it is stated on their website. Overall, this is an amazing place to stay. We are looking forward to coming back every year and even thinking about having our wedding at the Casa Marina. This is how much we loved our stay. I can't say enough good things about this place.

I called ahead to let them know that we would be arriving before the 4 p.m. check in time, and they offered to have our room ready earlier. We were able to check in around 2:30, instead of the usual 4:00. We reserved the most inexpensive room, the Island Vista Room, which was more than fine for us since we were only in Key West for a short visit, and we didnt plan on spending our vacation in our hotel room! the room was very clean, the bed and sheets were very comfortable, and there was plenty of space for the two of us. We did not have a bathtub, only a shower, and we did not have a balcony, but that was okay with us, due to the short amount of time that we spent there. The hotel is within walking distance to Duval Street. It took us about 10-15 minutes to get there. I liked the quiet location of this resort. It is tucked away from the hustle and bustle of Duval St., yet just a short walk from all of the action. We did not spend a lot of time using the hotel amenities, so the $20 resort fee seemed a bit unnecessary, but for those travelers who used the pool and beach daily, I think it was more than reasonable. The pools were in good condition, there were always plenty of lounge chairs with umbrellas to go around. We had lunch at the poolside restaurant which was reasonably priced and very good. We went to the liquor store upon our arrival, and made our own drinks to take out to the pool. The drinks were overpriced at the poolside bar, so I'm glad that we made the stop and got our own. We are not picky travelers, and for the most part are easy to please. The only recommendation that I have for this resort is to seperate the pools to have one of them be adults only. We went on Mother's day weekend and so there were a lot of families with children around the resort. It tended to get loud around the pool area with large groups of children everywhere. Overall, I would recommend this resort. Feel free to contact me with any specific questions you may have.

As previous reviews mentioned, at times the service was a little questionable (the hotel was very busy when we stayed) and the daily, planned activities seemed somewhat hit-or-miss. I especially noticed this with the activities planned for my very young children. The timing was either off or the activity never occurred. Also, if you are expecting a huge room you probably won't find it here; however, the hotel was built in the 1920s so you would expect that. That being said, the resort is so nice you probably won't spend much time in your room except to sleep. Having had a chance to see the island for the week, this is the best \"resort\" on Key West. The pools, the beach, the activities, and the amenities make this the place to stay. Everything you need is at your disposal. It is especially good for families with small children. Every employee of the hotel was very accomodating and the fellow guests were extremely kind. My two boys (three years old and sixteen months) had a blast in the pool and enjoyed the daily popsicles. They had no problem meeting other children and played all day long. The hotel also caters to couples on romantic getaways. Having multiple pools and the beach allowed these guests to have some alone time away from the children if they wanted. On another note, some reviews mentioned the excessive fees. It is true that they charge for parking, internet usage, a resort fee, etc. However, I did feel that I got my money's worth with the daily paper, the popsicles, free cocktail and water at the pool, access to a nice gym, etc. No one likes to pay more than they have to, but I didn't feel ripped off. Another point, eating at the hotel can be expensive, but before you go elsewhere realize that it is expensive to eat anywhere on the island. Some previous reviewers mentioned the $20/per person breakfast buffet not being worth it. After my experience, I'm not sure this is true. The second morning of our visit we decided to go out for breakfast. It cost me more to eat at IHOP ($45.00 for basic breakfast for four) than to eat at the hotel and the food wasn't nearly as good. The hotel was very flexible and allowed my children to eat off my platter since they don't eat very much and just wanted to get into the pool anyways. What I also missed at IHOP was the variety and the view. Finally, that's what I liked the most about the hotel; they were very flexible. They pretty much let you do what you wanted. We had friends staying at a different place who came to see us for the day and were allowed to enjoy the amenities of the resort with no hassles. While the bar by the beach was high-priced, you could just as easily go to a liquor store and stock up for the week and drink at your leisure by the pool or beach. To me, the attitude of the hotel exemplifies what Key West is all about: laid back and chilled. I will never stay anywhere else in Key West and there is no way this resort should be ranked #12 on this website. I'm guessing people are looking for perfection while all I want is relaxation and a good time.", "Date": "April 30, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Rochester, Minnesota", "Title": "\u201cNice Hotel\u201d", "Author": "C_Adventure", "ReviewID": "UR29020241", "Content": "When we arrived at 4pm - check-in time, we were told our room was not ready.

The resort itself is beautiful. It has a nice beach, two pools and a breezy, modern lovely decor. The service was better than we expected - everyone was very nice and exceedingly helpful with suggestions for dining, walking directions, etc. There are some problems with the resort, however, which should be addressed by the mangement of the hotel. First - our room was supposed to be an upgrade from a standard room (our travel agent booked it and told us about the upgrade). The room was small, overlooking the parking lot and had almost no space for clothing, personal belongings. The safe (which didn't work) and mini-fridge took up nearly all the cabinet space (no drawers anywhere) that should have been available for clothing. My boyfriend basically lived out of his suitcase as there was no place to put his clothes. And sadly, not only did the room have no terrace (which we were not surprised about) BUT the windows do NOT even open. We did ask to change our room and were told that they were fully booked and it wouldn't be possible. Much to our chagrin, the \"tennis on premises\" is a total construction sight. When we asked where the courts were located (we chose this hotel because of the purported tennis on premises), we were told that the courts were \"under repair\" (not true - we were later told that would probably never be reopened) and we would have to use the public courts next door. Two out the five courts next door were missing their nets and because the public courts are right on the beach the wind was way too fierce to play an enjoyable game. Upon check out - we complained about this and received a credit of the daily resort fee of $20. We did appreciate this, but it didn't make up for the fact that we weren't able to play. We had the buffet breakfast one morning and sat outside to dine. While we (and several other tables) were enjoying our breakfast (food ok - overpriced) a maintenance man was mopping the entire area (with a huge, stringy mop). While he didn't literally ask us to lift our feet to get under our tables, he did get mighty close! And one day the maid came and woke us at 9 AM to clean the room. We asked her to come back later and she never came back! We finally asked the front desk to have our room made up in the mid-afternoon and then were left with NO TOWELS. It took THREE phone calls to actually get someone to bring up towels nearly an hour later! And the computers in the lobby that are for the use of guests are so slow that they are virutally unusable. Anyone we saw using them walked away frustrated that they were unable to check their email, etc. In spite of the problems we did have a good time (the weather was wonderful, after all!) and I feel obligated to mention some of the good things. We were able to walk nearly everywhere (about 15 minutes to Duvall Street) and barely used our car (to park here is an extra $20 per day) We went to some incredible restaurants and had many amazing meals (all outside) - don't miss Blue Heaven (breakfast AND dinner), Sarabeth's (on Sunday night for their fried chicken!), Cafe Sole (hogfish), Azur (mozzarella/tomato/basil salad to DIE for), Nine One Five in the middle of Duvall Street. The snorkeling and kayaking with Danger Charters was terrific.

Also eat at Blue Heaven in town and be sure to save room for their key lime pie. A few minor complaints....there is only an instant espresso machine in the room. If you want coffee you have to go the lobby and shell out $3.25 + tax. And there is a daily $12 charge if you want internet in your room....you can get free internet at far less expensive motels everywhere....this is just wrong!! There are 2 computers you can use for free in the lobby, but people are always waiting to use them, so first you wait, then you feel rushed because others are waiting for you to finish. There really isn't tennis, as stated on the site, it's a public court down the street. The resort fee $20 daily added to your bill was supposed to include fresh fruit....I never saw any. Usually, if you are staying at a resort this nice and paying this much, the staff comes around in the evening and brings fresh towels and chocolates, or at least has cookies in the lobby. Here if you have a sweet tooth in the evening, open your wallet, again.... Don't get me wrong, we had a great time...I would recommend the place and I would stay there again....just little annoyances that would class the place up a little more.", "Date": "March 23, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "2", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "SD", "Title": "\u201cNice facility\u201d", "Author": "augievikings1992", "ReviewID": "UR26598651", "Content": "We enjoyed our stay at the Casa Marina.

We had three people staying in one room, and while the king size bed was comfortable, the pull out sofa bed was horrendous. However, the TV worked well, the coffee machine was a delight, and the shower and bathroom amenties were perfect. On top of this, we had a delightful balcony with a sliding glass door and a perfect view of the ocean and Key West's beautiful sunsets.

So we chose the Casa Marina for its great location. The beach really is beautiful and the hammocks are wonderful, but certainly not worth $300 a night. We checked in and our room was TINY, I would estimate it was half the size of your average hotel room. They say ocean view but what they really mean is an ocean peek. The small window in the room didn't even open, so you couldn't even get fresh air. We had no tub and no patio. So we called to be upgraded to a room with a tub and patio and the man was very helpful. He upgraded us to a one bedroom suite. We checked into that room and once again were disappointed. Our patio was nestled between the stairwell, the hallway and the parking lot, we had a flat screen tv with a blurry in and out picture. On top of all that, you would think for $300 a night (and that was a discounted rate too!) the coffee and shampoo and conditioner would have to be included. Nope, they charge you a 23.00 \"room fee\" for the coffee and the other amenities in your room. They even charge you to park!!! What exactly is the $300 dollars for if you still have to pay for every other convenience you should naturally be offered at any hotel! Also, definitely make a stop at the liquor store before you check in if you plan on having a few cocktails. We were hanging out on the hammock and decided to get a beer from the bar. Draft miller lite and bottled coronas were our only option and after paying our $16.oo tab for one beer each we decided to go sit in the hot tub, only to find out they don't have one! To end on a positive note, the one great thing about this place is the pool guy Steve. We hung out at the pool the next day and he was so helpful.

Upon booking, I was told that I would recieve a $50 credit for booking early. When I called later on to add my Hilton honors number, somehow that $50 disappeared. I requested an upgrade on \"My Way\" account. When we arrived, my heart sank as there was a huge conference for Urology. The hotel was all set up for all of these doctors to enjoy the conference here. Check in was harried. The fellow at the desk was very pleasant but apologized for not seeing the $50 credit, and informed us that there was no upgrade available, even if we wanted to pay for it. Upon checking the website later on, that was not true. Off we went to our room, and it was tiny. No problem, we are staying in Key West. We have this beaufitul hotel to enjoy swimming in the pool and the beach as well. I went to wash my face and there were no facecloths. I found a housekeeper that brought me some. I went back to the room and found a pubic hair on my bed. Now I am starting to cry. I went into the bathroom to wash my face and as I look around the floor is filled with hair. It was surface cleaned only. Gross. I called the front desk to ask what kind of amenities do I get for being a Gold member. I was told I get water and cookies. I got the water, no cookies. Why bother? I was not informed of any breakfast on the beach, or any free breakfast, or any dining in the hotel at all. We walked Duvall Street and ate at Blue Heaven....LOVED it...the food is well worth the price, you get what you pay for here. In the morning, we woke up to an alarm blaringat 6 a.m..

The hotel is beautiful, and the grounds are lovely. Here's what we really liked: Hotel location was great; not too close to Duval, but not far either, 10 minute walk. Beach was nice, pool was great, loved the hammocks. Steve, one of the pool/beach staff guys, was terrific. He was friendly, and always right there with our towels. Quality bed linens were nice too. What we didn't like: When we checked in, the front desk folks were really busy. The lady who helped us was nice enough, but as she checked us in, she kept stopping to take phone calls (guests calling about where to make dinner reservations, etc. etc.). After about the fourth call, I felt myself getting a little irritated. We'd been traveling all day and wanted to get to our room. For what we paid, we expected a little more. We were disappointed that we did not have a balcony/patio (not really the hotel's fault; we assumed the island view rooms had balconies) . The window in the room was not made to open, so we were also bummed that we couldn't even get fresh air. We requested a king size bed, but instead got a room with two double beds. When we called guest services to ask why we didn't get the king, we were told that when we made the reservation we could ony request a king, that there was no guarantee we'd get one. No sweat, we made due with the doubles. The room was quite small, and I was disappointed that there was not a closet or a dresser. There was only a wardrobe, and that was the only place we had to hang our clothes and store our suitcases. The sink faucet in the bathroom made a horrible thumping noise when the hot water was turned on. The litte counter area which housed the coffee maker and cups/glasses was dusty. We had a couple bags of snacks on the counter and when we got up the next day there were tiny ants crawling all over the bags. One major reason we chose this hotel is because it allows pets. We brought our small dog (she's 4 lbs), and we paid $125.00 non refundable pet fee, which was seemed reasonable. Our room was a few doors up from an exit to the outside stairwell, and while we were out of the room, our dog must've barked when she heard people coming in from outside, because on our last night there, we came back from dinner (around 10:30PM) and found a nasty note posted on our door. Not from the hotel staff, from our \"neighbor.\" The next morning we get a call (6:20AM) from the front desk, telling us they'd received a complaint about a dog barking. We check out that morning around 9:00AM, and we again find another nasty note on our door (from the same person). I'm sorry our dog disturbed a hotel guest, but it wasn't necessary to leave the ugly notes on our door. So, something to keep in mind if you're contemplating bringing your dog. This was our 5th trip to Key West. Previously we'd stayed at the Galleon, Eden House, and twice at The Southermost Motel. I'd always wanted to stay at the Casa Marina, and now that I have, I don't think I'd stay there again. The resort fees ($22.00 daily), the parking fees ($12.00 daily).... not happy about those either.

It was a little bit more expensive than some of the other advertised tours that I saw in brochures and along Duval Street, but the tour left from the Casa Marina dock, rather than the other side of the island where the rest of the tours docked and the boat was clean and spacious. I think it was worth the extra cost for the convenience of not taking a cab to the other dock and the crew of the boat was friendly and I felt safe during the entire trip. On the boat, there were sodas, beer, bottled water and chips for a snack after snorkeling. I needed a haircut while I was in Key West and went to Headlines Hair. CherylAnn was awesome. Great cut for a reasonable price and she recommended some great activities and shops. A few doors down from Headlines was the Red Chandelier where the owner, Eve, finds great clothes at amazing prices. She carried clothes that I would find at boutique shops in San Francisco, but at half the price. She mentioned that her rent is lower because she\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s just off of Duval Street, which helps keep her prices down. Eve also gave me some great suggestions on things to do in Key West. Overall, we had a nice stay and the location was relaxing and convenient. Again, if the Casa Marina can improve their quality of service, I would consider staying there again.", "Date": "February 18, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "washington d.c.", "Title": "\u201ca perfect 3 day getaway\u201d", "Author": "tuckerfore", "ReviewID": "UR24688912", "Content": "The staff, and Patrick at the front desk, in particular made this a wonderful stay.

First and foremost, what is impressive about the Casa is its setting. It's a stunnng paradise. The grand, imposing main building oozes class and tranquility with wonderful symmetry falling away to the pools, bar and grill, and then to the beach just 20 yards away. Classical paradise palm trees interspersed with hammocks and more than enough sun loungers etc. As you look out to the horizon there are beautiful old wooden piers to your far left and right and catch both the sunrise and sunset. We would definitely recommend an ocean view...spectacular every morning and night. Better still get a ground floor ocean view room. As you open your terrace doors you have your own sun loungers and table and chairs. Past these there are the grasses and 20 yards away, the sandy beach. From what we saw Casa Marina has the best beach on the island. We were very happy with our room which had a king bed but was still very spacious. Everything seemed pretty new and in very good order, including ipod docking. In terms of service, nothing was too much trouble. We were regularly asked if everything was OK with our stay and we have to say it sounded genuine rather than the usual soundbytes you get in some places. The staff really did seem to care and we have to mention Maria on Front Desk who is just lovely. They weren't just very professional and helpful but they would always stop and pass the time with you if that was your want. One didn't get any impression of a great hurry which added to the really relaxing experience. Re location, well we thought it was perfect. Far enough away from the craziness of the top end of Duval and Mallory ( which was chaotic) but walkable after a fun night out. If you don't fancy the walk, a cab takes minutes and costs circa 12 dollars. Absolutely the best of both worlds. Re prices and value, we found Key West on the whole very expensive ( don't go anywhere near LaTeDa Bar 23 dollars for2 glasses of wine!). But Casa was surprisingly reasonable. The breakfast buffet was 19 dollars each plus tip but was very extensive and delicious and you could have your eggs or omelette cooked before your eyes as you wanted. No need for lunch afterwards ! Otherwise you really do get what you pay for. Tips............The Reach up the road is a sister hotel and has a fantastic restaurant ..The Striphouse...gorgeous food if a bit pricey. But they have a fantastic gazebo for romantic evening strolls. Cut through to Duval by leaving the Casa complex out of the Watersports exit. Walk straight on and then 1st left into the Reach resort and cut through to Simonton (where the Cuban deli is)and then Duval..believe us it cuts out a lot. Also check out the 5th Floor observation deck at The Reach which also has some chairs etc where you can see across the whole island and get another view of the sunset and the cruise ships going in and out.

When we arrived at the hotel, we were really impressed. The hotel is without a doubt one of the most beautiful I have stayed at, and I have stayed in many beach resorts all over the world including the Caribbean, Hawaii, and Thailand. There were plenty of hammocks and beach chairs and the palm trees just made the scene perfect. Check-in was smooth and quick and the bell staff was nice. We drove our car here and self-parked for $12/night instead of $20 for valet. There are 2 computers in the lobby for guests to use for free internet. It was a 5-10 minute walk to get to Duval Street but there were plenty of taxies also. The room was nicely decorated with a tropical and luxurious theme. We had 2 queen beds which were very soft and comfortable. Our room was on the first floor with direct access to the beach from our balcony. I would recommend getting this kind of room if you decide to stay here. The expresso machine and iHome dock were nice touches to the room. The TV was flat screen. The bathroom was very small with only a shower, no tub. The shower got really annoying because the water would spray onto the floor because there is no door for the shower. There is a watersports company on the property that offers snorkeling trips, sunset cruises, kayaks, jet skies, and other rentals. I used it because of its convenience. The beach on the hotel is calm an very few people are in the water. If you have seen the hotel picture with the little diving platform in the middle of the ocean, it is impossible to get on because they have blocked it off. Our first problem occured when we found a trail for beach ants on the floor and sink area. We told management and they sent a mechanic with cleaner spray, which is a joke. The management then gave us the option of either switching floors immediately or waiting the next day to switch rooms on the same floor. We figured that this would be too much trouble for us since their options were pretty weak. This is a four star hotel and I payed good money! They should have offered better compensation(at the least a free bottle of wine or something) since we found the room to be infested with ants. Our next problem occured with their activity sheet, which by the way is a total joke. The hotel gave us a schedule of activities that they would have during our stay. One of the activities was a kayak tour to the Southernmost Point at 9 in the morning. I woke up early to prepare to go but when I arrived at the meeting location they gave us, no one was there. I went up to the front desk and they were pretty much clueless and didn't seem to care at all. They sent me to the pool director but he wasn't anywhere. Later, I went to another activity scheduled and again, no one was there. I then gave up on the activity sheet. It seemed to me like they made the sheet to make themselves look impressive. Our last major problem occured when we needed pool towels. Half of the time when I went to get beach towels, there were none left. One time, I went up to one of the pool guys who was standing right beside the EMPTY pool towel cart to ask for some towels. He told me that someone would be out with some in a minute so I stood there waiting. I think he thought that I would leave and come back later but I didn't so he and his buddy left to fetch towels. Do I smell liars? I think so I would hesitate to stay at this hotel again. I have stayed at many four star beach resorts around the world and this service is the worst. I would only recommend this hotel if you want a nice beach scene because that is really all you get.

For those of you that don't know, Key West only has a few beaches, and they are mainly on the south side of the island. Casa's beach is beautiful. You could swim in it if you want but with many Atlantic beaches (aside from the Bahamas and Miami beach), they are a little rougher and rockier. It is large as is the resort. There are many palm trees and many piers to go out on. A great way to see the sun rise and sun set. This is the type of place you see post cards made from. There are free hammocks and lounge chairs for those who just want to sit on the beach and soak up the sun. Great for those notherners who come here in December. Like many places in Key West, it is a potpourri of different ethnic groups which is nice and refreshing. The hotel itself is an old hotel but very modern and pretty. The rooms are a decent size with very modern decor, even in the bathroom. I highly suggest a ocean view as it is perfect (other then the palm trees which seem to be in the way of many good pictures). There is a boat (jet ski, paddle boat, etc) rental right on site. There is a spa here as well which we did not use. Many ballrooms for those who want to have private functions here (seems like a very nice place for a wedding). The staff was very nice and always were opening doors for you and greeting you. Also the restaurant here served pretty good food be be forewarned, it is outside dining only, so it can get chilly. On to the complaints, and there weren't too many. FEES!!! $20 resort fee, $12/day parking, $12 internet (and don't think about using one of the two free internet computers in the lobby, not only are they 56k modem slow, but people will sit there and stare at you until you get off. And then general high priced items that you find at any hotel/resort. Lunch was a decent price, dinner seemed way too high for the options (which we didn't eat). Also, between 6:30am - 7:30am, the grounds crew was cleaning up the beach. While this may sound good, it was VERY VERY LOUD waking both of us. We like to sleep with the door open to hear the ocean but that still didn't matter. They had a guy driving a tractor around combing the beach (something that could be done by hand or with something electric that is not so loud. Also, a guy was trying to clean off the sand on the walkways with a leaf blower. Again, very loud, right outside our window, and something a broom would have done a much better job at. However, the good definitely out weighed the bad and then some. Many have said that Duval street is still walkable, but I'd stay its at least a mile to the south end, then another .5 mi to get to where the action is so a cab would be a better idea cause parking isn't really realistic on Duval. And there are cabs waiting outside the hotel 24/7. We booked on the hotel website which had a special of $50 credit for each two days you stayed which was nice as was our stay! Could have been closer to the action but with two pools and a nice beach, this is the place you come to relax at as the action of Duval is not too far away.", "Date": "December 21, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Chicago, Il", "Title": "\u201cPhenominal Resort\u201d", "Author": "Sunshinegirl0509", "ReviewID": "UR22817193", "Content": "I had the pleasure of staying at the Casa Marina Resort in early December.

I booked an Ocean Vista Suite and carefully read what that means. This is from their website: \"Ocean View Suites feature your own private balcony, either directly on the beach, or overlooking the tropical pools with the beach just beyond.\" I also booked the bread and breakfast package. We arrived and you cannot see the ocean from the room. If you go out on the balcony and take turns peering around the corner through the trees you can see the ocean. When I asked the bellman about this he said \"Our policy is to describe the view from the balconies\" This in my opinion is deceptive and I told him so. We requested a crib when we made the reservation and I am happy to report that they don't charge extra. Internet is $12 per day which annoys me. Why is it that if you stay in a Motel 6 for $39 you get free internet but you stay at a $300 hotel in it is extra? (I'm not criticizing just Casa Marina here...the George V did it to me in Paris) When I checked in, I asked if the crib was in the room and they said no but we see it here on the request. So why wasn't it in the room? They said it would be up in 5 minutes. I had a tired baby and said so. Thirty minutes later and after requesting to come and get it myself and being told rudely by an operator named \"Alexis\" that I wasn't allowed to go where they kept them, it arrived. The hotel website doesn't market itself to families with toddlers and justifiably as the pools are too deep for a toddler to go in so think about that if you have small children. There is however, a delightful little paddle area in the ocean that my 2 year old loved. The worst part was the food. DO NOT EAT HERE! Have I made myself clear? We had been specifically warned that the food was bad but we aren't particularly picky if we aren't out for a nice meal. I had mussels and my wife had gnochhi our first night. I was actually worried I was going to get sick from mine and so ate less than half. the sauce they came in was bland. The gnocchi was just tasteless. The next morning we had breakfast. My wife liked her omelette from the buffet well enough. I had Huevos Rancheros which Ihtought was impossible to screw up...the tortilla must have been found in an old pirate stash it ws so dry and hard. The next day I had eggs sunnyside and they were cooked hard. The third day I decided to have the omelette guy cook them and still had to demand he stopped cooking them when he thought they were not ready...they were just over cooked. And the toast was cold and the butter frozen...yuck. The grounds are very nice and it has its own beach which is the reason we may possibly stay there again. We certainly won't get the breakfast package and we won't pay extra for an \"ocean view\" suite.

We took a couple of beers down to the beach and enjoyed the privacy and 2 piers they have. The grounds are very nice and you always feel like you're staying somewhere special. However, a few niggles. We tipped the cleaner but the conditoner was not replaced, nor was the coffee or milk. We had to call down for this, and only the coffee and milk turned up. Usually when we tip in hotels, we get these things in abundance. Also, one day we were walking upto the main entrance, and a luggage cart came rolling towards us pretty quickly. The bellman had let go of it at a car he was loading. Instead of coming after it, he just stood there and watched as the cart came hurtling towards my partner who had to grab it in order to avert it hitting a car, and was pulled a few metres by it. No-one seemed particular grateful or apologetic, which irriated me a bit. The in room book which usually gives details on facilitieshad nothing and just said 'call XXXX' which wasn;t much help.

Good points first: The hotel (particularly the old building) is lovely, although the newer building looks from the back like a block of flats. Not particularly great. The beach was great (by Key West standards) and is cleaned every morning; and we had no problems getting sun beds. They also serve complimentary drinks mid-morning, and cold towels in the afternoon, which is a nice touch. Staff generally very professional and friendly, although non memorable. Room (Ocean Vista Room) was of generous size with perfect ocean views. The room had windows/patio doors to two aspects and although the room was decorated in muted colours, it worked well for the hotel and location. Things they need to work on: We arrvied at the hotel after 14 hours travelling. Tired and slightly disorientated, the least I expected was to be shown to my room. The receptionist was more interested in \"processing\" us than ensuring we were welcomed. We took directions from her... got lost and then eventually found the room. A poor start, I thought. The room was not serviced daily to an acceptable standard. From what I could see, the bed was made and towels changed, but no real dusting, floor cleaning, etc. Such that by the last day, the room was dirty. And one day they just \"forgot\" to even make the beds. The power to Key West went off on our last day. The hotel had back-up generators which powered key lights. To their credit, they kept the kitchen open and served food from the outside restaurant. The chef needs a medel for working in the dark! No, to start with, they had some lights on at the restaurant, but then decided to turn them off, with about 40 people eating. Luckily for the two people on reception, the ENTIRE reception was illuminated. Now, I get that power sometimes goes off, but I don't accept that management cannot be organised enough to ensure a supply of candels and keeping lights on in areas where most guest reside. Thankfully, immediately after dinner the lights came back on so we went into town! They seem to have surcharges for EVERYTHING, which turns what, on the surface, look like a reasonable hotel, into something more expensive. To contrast, after KW we headed for Miami and stayed at the 5* The Raliegh. The cost was the same. Be careful, as they add on charges for use of the beach, parking, etc, etc...

But, first the positives, the hotels common areas were lovely and the pool was great. Had a small, but descent beach and a bar/grill next to the pool for convenience. The food and drinks were extremely pricey, but thats to be expected and its helpful to pickup a few snacks before arriving. Now the negatives - This is not a resort by any real defintion - the $20 resort fee is just a way to extract extra money for nothing. For all they say was included in the resort fee, we never saw - Never offerred cool towels, never saw any additional activities other than fee rental for motorized water equipment (not a \"resort\" fee type amenitiy). Next, the walls are paper thin and the hotel is extremely noisy all night long. Ask for a room in the newer addition or the center of the hotel. We were placed at the end of the hotel next to the stairwell and were awakened every 30 minutes or so with loud slamming noises until we asked to be moved at 4:00 am. The staff were not helpful, nor empathetic to the situation. Once moved, we finally went to sleep only to be woken very early with the noise of coversations in the next room. We could hear them all morning (and I don't think they were being that loud). As others have stated, there isn't much around for meals - Only one restuarant we found a block or so away. You'll need to walk a few blocks or more for anything other than the hotel grill or room service and it's a good 2 mile walk from the pier at Duvall Street. Be wary of parking if you drive and look for off street parking. The hotel did not tell us this, but we found it on our own. It's an additional $20 per day for valet or $12 to self-park across the street, but we parked on the street, next to the hotel for no charge. Look for this if you choose to come. With the alleged \"resort\" fee of $20 + parking if you drive (and the added taxes to both) that can add quite a bit extra to your hotel bill. The Concerige was little help in giving us information on sight-seeing and various attractions. After getting little information at the hotel, we struck up a conversation at a restuarant for breakfast and found out everything we wanted to know from the waitress there - Thank you IHOP for the great service and staff!

It was remedied but I thiink the overall total would have been less if I had taken the original room option \"I\" had chosen. The hotel is ABSOLUTELY beautiful....on the ocean and the physical property itself. The check-in process, although quick, did leave me with some concerns. I have stayed at MANY hotels and if arriving early the check-in staff has always worked with me to provide a place to freshen up, shower, and change OR get me into a room that was available, not the original room placed on my reservation. This hotel did not get me in early so I had to check every 30 minutes to assess availability. I acknowledged the fact the hotel does stipulate a 4p check-in but it only has a changing room, not a shower. This is also an inconvenience when checking out because you need to check out by 11a and without a shower, even in the health club facilities, you cannot utilize the property unless you want to get on the plane sticky, smelly from sun tan lotion...etc. I suggest the site look into all of the check-in practices/ \"other than room\" shower facilities. PROs: 1) Property, bell staff, doorman, waitresses, concierge, complimentary computer access in lobby only if you need to take a quick look as MANY people are awaiting to use some times. 2) Pool staff periodic walking around with complimentary watermelon, popscicles, and \"small \" drink samples. CONs: 1. Check-In process and willing to work with guests that arrive earier than check-in or want later check-out. 2. NO COMPLIMENTARY WIRELESS ACCESS. I have not stayed in a hotel or guest house in quite a few years that does not offer. 3. Onsite restaurant/pool bar is EXTREMELY expensive and drinks are watered down. NOT worth the price. 3) Location is a bit remote if you are looking to be in life of it all down on DUVAL. It's a 35-40 minute walk to get from hotel to Mallory Square area. My family did it daily, however, needed to take a taxi a few times...especially if dressing up nicely for dinner. 4) No whirlpool/hot tub on property. Overall- I would stay again if had family with me due to the property being right on ocean. This is a rarity for Key West and people do like the ocean. However, when traveling alone or if being on the ocean is NOT a requirement there are MANY MANY MANY other Guest Houses on Key West that do offer all the conveniences and luxuries I require and it's a more personable experience.

My wife and I enjoyed our anniversary by taking a trip down to Palm Beach and Key West. Luckily, we had perfect weather (with the exception of one day) despite the evacuation of the Keys due to Hurricane Fay; our trip to Key West started the day the evacuation was lifted. We have stayed at several Key West resorts, and this hotel is the nicest in Key West. It sports the only true beachfront experience in Key West, and has amazing views from oceanfront rooms as well as the common areas. Sitting at the outdoor bar was certainly our favorite experience. Jan the bartender was phenomenal... what a kind and fun woman, and she makes a mean cocktail! If you face the ocean from the bar, it reminds you of the commercials for Coronna.... you know the ones. I noted that on my stay, and when I showed a colleague some of the photos from the bar, she said the same thing without my coaxing. Absolutely wonderful. The food is casual, reasonably priced and tasty. We enjoyed our lunch there each day of the trip. Overall the hotel had excellent service. It was clean and enjoyable. While outside at the beach, cabana persons will set up umbrellas for you, get you towels, provide cool wet hand towels to refresh and cool off with as well as complimentary fresh cut fruit. While I would normally give it a top rating, I did have two slight complaints. The children at the pool can be a bit much. I do wish they would enforce some rules at times. My biggest complaint did not affect my rating though as it was not necessarily the fault of the Casa Marina. The hotel has a sister hotel called the Reach (a few blocks away), which my wife and I have stayed at in the past. We dined there one night at a relatively pricey (not outrageous but not cheap either) restaurant called the Strip House. I am aware this is a small and growing chain and do not know the exact relationship with the two hotels (they might lease the space, but might also split profits in some way with the hotel operators). I have to tell you, the food was exceptional and the service from the busboys was very good as well; however, our waitress was abysmal. Her name was Carol. I cannot tell you how angry we were as she ignored our table for lengthy periods. Most of our service came from the busboys (we'd call them over). The meal started with her attempting to upsell our wine, which she noted was only a few dollars more. When I looked at the price, I laughed becuase it was 66% higher in price. After declining, she seemed to become cold and rarely checked on us. This represented the worst table service I have had in years. I worked for tips when I was younger, and am very tolerant; but this woman really was horrible. Of course we got the typical bright smiling Carol as she presented the check in that typical pathetic bad waitron fashion attempting to garner a better tip. I left a reasonable tip only because I figured they might pool their tips and those poor busboys were working hard. Worst of all, I stepped out for a cigarette between courses and noticed this gem of a waitress chewing out one of the busboys that was actually working hard. Really disgusting. I rarely write complaints, but I couldn't help myself on this one. When we return to the Keys (we usually go once a year), I will walk out of that establishment if she is working. If she is, I promise I'll never eat in any Strip House again. Very sad, as the restaurant was fantastic but for good ol' Carol.", "Date": "September 3, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "4", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Blue Bell, PA", "Title": "\u201cLoved the Casa\u201d", "Author": "heidibluebell", "ReviewID": "UR19516520", "Content": "My family of 8 and I just returned from 6 days at the Casa Marina.

The hotel was very accommodating to our request for an oceanview room with two double beds (as opposed to one king) and later than expected arrival due to flight delays. Had a minor issue with the room not having been properly vacuumed upon our arrival, but the front desk handled promptly and satisfactorily, including compensation of the resort fee for that night (and then an additional night when the resort fee removal was not reflected on our bill at checkout). Housekeeping throughout the rest of the stay was without problems. In the end, these few minor bumps were far surpassed by the beautiful surroundings, private beach, two pools, beach/pool concierge extras (ice water, sample drinks, popsicles, watermelon slices, and cold towels), and in-house dining at the Sun Sun Bar & Grill. We enjoyed several meals at the Sun Sun--lunch every day of our stay and dinner three nights of our stay (one at a private table set up on the beach). Everything that we ate was excellent and far exceeded other meals that we ate outside the resort. But, what stood out the most was the service provided by all of the Sun Sun staff and, in particular, by Joshua.

We were down for the weekend to check out venues for our wedding next May. I will start with the likes: We loved the grounds-minus the seaweed, but this is the time when they do have a lot of seaweed. We liked that we could chill out on the beach in a hammock or a chaise. We also liked the large pool floats that we both could float on, which was relaxing and with all of the kids and adults playing around in the pool. We liked our ocean view from the room, especially at night. I liked the mp3 player/alarm radio (I don't say IPOD because I have a zen and mine worked just fine). The bed was comfy. The service was decent. The staff was helpful when you asked for help. I liked that I could be at a more quiet end of the island without having too far of a ride to get to the action of Duval. Now, the dislikes: The seaweed, which is not their fault it is a naturally occurance, but I thought the upkeep could have been better. The poor service on the beach and poolside. I'm a small woman, and I can take care of myself. My fi would usually gather our chaises to lounge on the beach, since the beach staff never came over to offer help. One day, I had to get a chaise by myself, which I have no problem doing, except they were stacked a little high for me and I struggled a bit to release one..again, not a problem until I turned around a saw the hotel's beach attendant sitting down and looking at me as I was dragging the chair to my location without ever offering to assist me. He then gets up to remove empty chairs. Apparently, you have to go up to him and ask him for assistance. This would be an example of lacking that special something. Also, we never once had anyone take our drink order at the pool or on the beach. So, I never witnessed any of the staff going that extra step to provide excellent hospitality. The drinks at the bar....SKIP THE BAR if you want a decent mixed drink. We're used to paying a lot of money for drinks and is not a problem when they have alcohol in them. The drinks seemed watered down and after two days I decided to watch them make the drinks and if they didn't give me the right pour (I've bartended before) I would ask for a remake. Which they would do, so not a problem except I shouldn't have to eagle eye the making of my drinks. We did not like the shower stall in the rooms. I'm short so not a problem for me to push the shower head all the way back so water doesn't land all over the bathroom floor. But my fi is 6ft and this was not an option for him, so we ended up with wet floors, and having to ask for bathmats (which were not replenished) to clean it up. Room service was ok. I ordered huevos rancheros with avocados, and the avocados arrived brown and mushy. The thin walls. I could hear my neighbors. So I know they could hear us...Sorry to my neighbors :-). We are not loud people, but normal bedroom activities can be heard. I also heard a neighbor urinating in the toilet and then flushing. Some other comments: Saw two weddings at the same time. Which seems like a factory to me. The beach area was not cleaned up for the ceremony. I had checked out Casa Marina prior to my trip for wedding info, and I know that it is not an inexpensive venture to host a wedding there. So they could at least have made the area nicer. I decided when we arrived Friday, that I would give the Casa a chance as my venue, so I called and left a message with the wedding coordinator at the resort. 6 days later and still no phone call. I've chosen the Hyatt and I love the location, and as another reviewer stated the water is clearer. So Casa definitely lost out on business with me. All this to say, we would probably stay again, but in the off season when the rates are less, as it's not worth it to pay more than what we paid. The view is fantastic, but I wasn't wowed. And if you drink alcohol, bring your own liquor and mixers and some plastic cups and enjoy them at the pool or beach. You'll save money and disappointment. On a positive note, my fi left his running shoes, and called back yesterday and they said they would mail them back to us for free.

I stayed at their sister resort a few years back, the Reach Resort (it costs less, but was much better in my opinion) We travel often for business and pleasure, so I'll give you the good, bad and the ugly about the Casa. The Good: beautiful architecture from the early 1900's, has a private beach, but it's covered in smelly sea weed (most of the island is.... there is a small private beach next to the Hyatt that is all gulf of Mexico water and you can see the bottom, no seaweed), Nice big gym across the street, decent food even though it's overpriced (but all hotels are), Ipod clock radio in room, wave runner and other water sport rentals on site. The Bad: No bathtub in ocean view suites, Our first room smelled of thick mold and we got moved to a smaller room, Wedding guests get first priority, Staff with thick accents or non-english speaking which was very frustrating, they do not clean your room every day unless you remember to leave the \"service please\" tag in your door, modern upgrades to room were inconvenient (for example, no glass door on shower or shower curtain, only one exposed socket for electronics), Pool has no deep end, so the water was actually hot, giving no relief (you have to walk out on the pier into the ocean to cool off), the staff puts large rafts in the pool and allows paddle ball and other sports in the pool leaving very little room to swim (not to mention it's obnoxious having balls flying past your head in the pool, one almost hit us) The Ugly: There is a resort fee of $20 per day on top of the parking fee (self-park is $12 per night or valet is $20 per night), Valet is not always outside to fetch your car either! The breakfast staff is super slow - better off going to IHop on Truman/Rt 1 or going to the Banana Crepe Cafe on Duval St. for breakfast, also the hotel is not in walking distance to any nightlife or restaurants. Our next trip to Key West is next summer, we will probably stay at the Hyatt Resort and try that one out. We will not return to the Casa and I would not recommend it to my friends. Key West is a great, fun place with many options. Don't get sold on the pictures from the Casa web site, the entire island is gorgeous no matter where you stay. Also, if you're thinking of a wedding there beware, we saw one take place on the beach - they didn't even move the beach chairs or trash cans and there was smelly seaweed in the backdrop (you'd think they would rake it up!) Also, the best restaurant to visit it A&B Lobster house -- it's dressy and a pricier meal, but I can guarantee you won't find a better seafood meal anywhere in the country.

Since this place is not cheap, I kind of thought we would get that for free since we paid $300 per night! The morning breakfast was pretty crummy as well- another $20 and service was horrible.

We absolutely loved it and will definitely be back. This was our second time in Key West (1st time was 8 yrs ago) and although many things have changed there, this little island continues to amaze me. This time, my sister and future brother-in-law joined us and we had an amazing time!!! There so many things that we enjoyed at the Casa and I'm afraid I'll run out of room to review all of them, so here's a \"short\" list: 1. The BREAKFAST BUFFET is soooo worth it ($20pp)- it's a buffet people-you can eat as much or as little-this includes coffee and juice that your server will refill and refill and refill to your heart's content! There is a hot and cold station, complete with an\"egg station\" where Ivan will whip up eggs made to order. Look for Erik, our server, he is FUNNY and he loves his job! 2. The two POOLS do not have a diving board (future brother-in- law and husband not so happy about this) and the deepest part is only 4'6\" (my sis was happy about this, hubby and b-i-l were not). I didn't care either way because the ocean was only a few feet away if I wanted to do some \"real\" swimming. But, once again, the service is outstanding: towels are arranged for you and, if desired, they will also set up an umbrella for you (there aren't that many so try to get a spot early). There is also waiter service poolside - have the pina colada w/a Myer's rum floater- DELICIOUS! And may I add that they do not skimp on the alcohol whatsoever. And oh yeah, the FREE popsicles and watermelon are also a nice touch. Mike, the pool guy, is great and yes, \"service with a smile\" exists here. WOW! 3. The BEACH- yes-it's rocky and the \"dirt\" is called seaweed and that \"smell\" is the ocean. Let's not forget that Key West sits on fossilized coral which makes for rocky beaches (but in the modern world we have what's called \"aqua shoes\" to solve this problem). The Casa is very diligent about combing the beach and removing the seaweed every morning. Here, the staff will also set up chairs and umbrellas for you and YES- there is also waiter service along with the FREE popsicles and fruit and lemon water. There is alot of seaweed at this time of year but one tends to overlook this when the water is so warm and inviting. There are so many seagulls flying about (pretty), but mysteriously, there is no bird POOP. 4. Our ROOM was a one bedroom ocean vista suite. We arrived an hour and a half early and to our surprise, both rooms were ready. I requested to be right on the ocean and I was literally steps from it. The suite was on the 1st floor and the balcony faced the water. Every morning, I sat on the balcony to watch the sunrise and the guy combing the beach, as well. My only pet peeve was the cigarrette butts that people would toss from the higher balconies, but I believe this was cleaned up throughout the day. The suite is very clean and very new and the bed is COMFORTABLE. The bathroom is HUGE and we had a shower door. My sis and her fiance had the Flagler room and there was no shower door (as reviewed by previous guests, the wet floor was a problem for them). Our rooms were cleaned everyday and the New York Times was delivered every morning. No complaints here. Note: The only minor distraction from my relaxing experience at the Casa Marina was the amount of children at this hotel. Now, I like kids, don't get me wrong, but 30 kids splashing and carrying on by the pool will eventually become annoying. So, if you are looking for that ultra romantic, secluded and \"adults only\" feel to a resort, the Casa is not for you. Maybe, during school season, there won't be that many kids. Also, we did NOT encounter the non-English speaking staff here at the Casa, only the very pleasant and \"could not do enough for you\" staff. And by the way, everyone says \"good morning\" here. I'm from NYC, so this is a WOW factor for me! For you non-walkers, the Casa is about a 15-20 min. walk to Mallory square, but there are cabs and the hotel has bikes, mopeds and electric cars for rent. We walked all over the island and explored \"outside\" of Duval street.

The lobby is beautifully furnished with modern funiture and deep dark hard wood floors and pillars.

After checking in with a very capable front desk staff I walked to the room with the dissapointment that my room was located on the first floor. My dissapointment was shortly changed as I walked in to the room, walked to the curtains, pulled them back to see the awe inspiring ocean view where we could literally walk off of our patio on to the private beach of the resort. Not just the view was amazing but so was the room. Once again beautifully furnished and modern design. The pool and the beach are gorgeous with staff stopping by your lounge chair periodically offering a frozen washcloth to cool off with or fresh watermelon. Definatly first class service.

The bed was heavenly! Only complaint would be we could hear noise from the other rooms. Pool area was magnificent. Mike, the pool attendant, was very attentive - setting up towels on the chair for you immediately, and periodically going around with ice waters, popsicles and fruit juices. Spent little to no time on the beach, but you can swim in the ocean via steps off the pier. Breakfast buffet in the morning was nice and they have THE BEST yogurt parfait. We had one every morning for breakfast (can also buy them in the gift shop). Location is a little off the beaten path, but within walking distance to Duvall. If it wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t so hot, we would\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve done more walking, but opted to take a cab more often (between $8-$12). If you have a car, park in the lot across the street. It is $12 a day, but you can come and go as you please without paying additional. Other minor complaints would be prices at the bar ($6 per beer) and for food. Very expensive, but in line with lots of other prices we encountered. I would suggest stopping by the store for beer, water, etc. and storing it in the fridge in your room. Mahi sandwich we had at the restaurant outside for lunch wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t edible.

The absence of a proper restaurant becomes a major inconvenience when staying for more than a few days. 2. For many people, umbrellas are needed to provide sunshades on the beach. The umbrellas that were weighted down have been replaced by umbrellas that are spiked at the bottom and as the beach is fossilised coral beneath the shallow sand, the spike is not able to penetrate the ground, despite strenuous efforts of the beach attendants. Result is umbrellas not able to be used and stressed guests hoping that one of the limited areas of shade beneath the palm trees will be available when they want to relax on the beach. Please bring back the beach umbrellas that are weighted down at the bottom. 3. Radios without personal earpieces are permitted on the beach so the peace and relaxation sometimes becomes difficult.

As soon as we walked into Casa Marina we were absolutely delighted with the building, interiors and atmosphere. There's a real Old World charm to the place and all the furniture and decor are extremely tasteful. It really feels like a tropical setting in colonial times. We arrived early and our room wasn't ready yet, but they made us feel welcome by inviting us to relax at the pool while they kept our luggage for us. The international staff were friendly, courteous and efficient, contrary to what other reviews have stated. As soon as we got to our room, they brought our bags up without delay. The pool areas were picture perfect and extremely clean. In fact, maintenance and cleaning started like clockwork early every morning. Towels were always available and the waitstaff very attentive. The resort might have recently replaced some of their earlier staff because there was no evidence of employees who couldn't speak English, as mentioned in other reviews. Food and drinks were very good, and no more expensive than in any other luxury hotel. If you're shocked by such prices, you have to realize that this is standard for a place like this. Our bedroom was clean and very stylishly decorated. Our balcony was large - with a perfect view of the pool and ocean. We were lucky to have gotten an Ocean Vista room, actually in the main historic building. (Balconies in the new building aren't as large as the one we got.) Overall, Casa Marina was perfect for a couples getaway - quiet and relaxing - not too close to the downtown action. We walked to Duval Street everyday with no problems at all. It's about a 15-minute walk. We also rented bikes, which were available right at the hotel. This isn't a place where you'll see guests who are loud partyers. In general, it seemed like the clientele were more like my husband and myself - professional couples on a getaway, as well as families. The doorman was gracious almost to a fault.

My two granddaughters and I spent a magical week at the Casa Marina Resort in Key West, Florida. Our every wish and whim was attended to with a professional but personal attitude. We went out on the Tiki boat, arranged through Key West Sports onsite, and the girls swam and snorkeled. Captain Duck and First Mate Dave went above and beyond anything necessary. My youngest granddaughter had a panic attack in the water and Dave dove in without hesitation and rescued her. NOT ONLY did he rescue her, but he calmed her and offered to stay with her or swim with her to the reef. She has asthama and I was truly afraid she might have an attack brought on by her panic. I simply find it difficult to convey in words my gratitude toward Dave and his instant response to her situation which I think could have become a serious problem without his immediate action. Both Captain Duck and Dave treated all of the passengers as if they were each a very special person, which made the entire event just amazing. We found the resort food delicious and well prepared with ample servings. (We could never finish all of the food on our plates.) The amenities were perfect. The staff was more than accomodating and very kind. Any inquiry was immediately addressed with a satisfactory result. We will surely return to this lovely resort because of the outstanding staff and the breathtaking views, beach and pools as well as the convenience of having everything close at hand. We enjoyed riding bikes around Key West and delving into the true flavor of the island. The girls are already planning another trip next summer!!!! (I hope they are also planning to get jobs!) When I asked them their favorite and least favorite parts of the trip their response was, favorite was \"everything\", least favorite, \"having to leave\".

Casa Marina was running a great deal and we hadn't heard anything substantially disappointing about the hotel other than some construction issues so we decided to stay here. We arrived early and decided to see if our room was ready. Surprisingly, it was ready and we had our room keys within minutes. NOTE: we thought we had a king room, but little did we know that it wasn't guaranteed, so we ended up with a double room. Not the biggest ordeal and the hotel provided us with $50 resort credit (which was originally free breakfast the next morning a $44 value, but we spoke with the manager and got it changed to general credit since we weren't interested in a breakfast buffet). We stayed Monday thru Wednesday, everything was great! There was no construction going on. Everything was new, clean and very luxurious. We hung out by the pool both days and chairs were easy to come by but umbrellas were not. Given the Key West heat, they were in high demand. Servers came by on the hour with either a free drink of the day or popsicles to help keep us cool. Also, in the afternoon, they serve free \"key lime coolers\", basically a virgin mojito, in the lobby. Those were awesome! We were not familiar with the area before heading down there and we were told that Casa marina was further away from duval street which keeps it quiet. Personally, Casa marina has an awesome location. You can be on duval street (the opposite end of the partying) within 2 minutes via scooter. BTW, rent a scooter from Tropical Rentals on duval (very reasonable, if not cheap, prices). A solo scooter for 24 hours ran $35 and a double runs $75 a day, and cheaper for extra days. If you want to travel to Mallory Square at sunset, it will take you about 10 minutes with all the traffic lights. Key West isn't a big place, so everything is relative. To complete your stay, here are some recommendations that were given to us before we went down: 1. Blue Heaven (brunch on the weekends, breakfast-lunch-dinner throughout the week) 2. Ambrosia (sushi, very close to casa marina, excellent food) 3. Salsa Loca (mexican, excellent!, closed on mondays) 4. Better than sex (dessert restaurant, very good and intimate, closed on mondays) 5. Ana's cafe (walk-up window, cuban food...great breakfast!) 6.

We had a fabulous time. This was my first trip since the renovation, yet we have stayed with the Casa on several other occasions. Here are some observations and highlights: - The coffee and danish bar in the hotel lobby store is a great alternative to the expensive hotel buffet. If you are a small eater for breakfast or watching the budget, check this out. Chocolate Danish is awesome! - Cab fare downtown is $2.50 now per person (when you have 4 or more in the car. Slightly higher for a couple, but maybe only a buck more.) This is very reasonable and convenient. - Onsite activities offer lots of water sports incl., jet skiing, parasailing, fishing, hobie cats, etc. w/o ever leaving the property. We rented bikes one day from here - $15.00 pp for the whole day - was fantastic. - the pools and beach are wonderful. No complaints and Mike our pool attendant was friendly and always accomodating. The cool towels, popsicles, watermelon, and water w/ lime poolside is a much appreciated treat during sunbathing or pool time. - a few negatives - I would think if one is going to spend 40-some million on renovations that insulation in the walls would be on that list. Due to the buildings age there are some issues with noise and sounds from the hallway and street. Its really no big deal - but just an observation. A friendly rooster in the parking lot woke us every morning around 5:30 am : ) Ocean side may not have that issue. And the new designs and furniture are beautiful but some of it doesnt make a lot of sense in the real world - like the astetically pleasing shower w/ a 1/2 glass door, looks fantastic but doesnt quite contain all the water from the shower leaving the door and floor wet. And be aware that in the new bathroom behind the solid french doors, your room mate can see into the bath. Just and FYI for the modest among us. Overall the Casa is wonderful and its very hard for me to find anything at all negative. Oh - one other surprise - the shuttle from the airport used to be a free service, this is no longer the case. the shuttle will do airport service, but its $7.50 pp. Just for those that have been here before - its a surprise. A new find for me on this trip and a must do next time --- Smather's Beach. I've been to Key West probably 10 times, and have driven by Smather's many times, but never walked out there until this trip. We had seen a month or so ago on the Travel Channel that this beach was highly rated and its easy to see why - absolutely stunning. check it out!

The european design is beautiful and elegant; the grounds are stunning and clean. Upon check-in, we were upgraded to an ocean-view room, with a walk-out balcony. The balcony was huge, shaded and had 6 chairs and a small table! our room had high ceilings, wood floors, plenty of room to move around and a modern bathroom. The in-room ammenities, like the bathrobes, shampoo, towels and especially the bedding were nice. The mattress was very comfortable. We would have liked the option of regular coffee, either in our room or the lobby, because the standard espresso machine in every room was impressive, but we don't like espresso. Also, a restaurant would have been useful because we aren't morning people and we had to go into town to search for breakfast (room service was available, but was pricey). The service and guest communication still needs to be upgraded, however. For example, on the day of our arrival, there were complimentary, non-alcoholic mojitos in the lobby. However, we never saw them again, even though we looked. Perhaps they are served at a certain time each day or only on certain days? Is there a happy hour where drinks or snack are served half-off, for example? If there are organized events for the guests, we were not informed of them. We saw beach buffets, but had to inquire about them because we were not informed of them at check-in. And, the in-room hotel literature and TV station information need to be updated to match the renovation. For example, both advertisements state that there is a whirlpool on the premises, but when we couldn't find it and asked at the front desk, we were simply (and impassively) told that there wasn't one anymore. The only services that were \"perfect\" were the valet and the pool attendant. The valets were helpful, kind, funny and quick.

I was a little apprehensive since some of the reviews were not as good as I would have liked, but my insecurities were gone as soon as we set foot on the property. The Casa was the most beautifully decorated (IMO) property in Key West, being that Key West is an older city, a lot of the properties there look a little run down (at least on the outside) but the Casa is luxury from the parking lot to the beach. The service was good from the moment we got there too. I guess we are just not picky people and we weren't expecting much form the hotel to begin with since we were mainly going to the Keys to relax and get away, not to act like little divas. We just slept there and chilled at the pool area, nobody bothered us and we really weren't looking to bother anybody either. They did pass out popsicles and towels which was nice, there are two pools and neither are ever really crowded which is a plus, there were always plenty of chairs for everyone, there was always someone asking if we needed something, but they weren't pushy about it so that was good, we enjoyed ourselves and will definitely be going back to the Casa next year. They had a nice Mother's Day brunch, but we did not try it since it was way over priced for our taste, but we weren't bothered by it, it was just expected, we simply went to town for food. Our room was clean every day after breakfast but we had to make sure we put the sign on our door in order for the staff to do it, which makes sense, imagine being on your honeymoon and having the cleaning people walk into your room to clean it. LOL! The only thing that we didn't like was the fact that the casa was not as close to duval street as we thought, which can be a good thing since it makes the casa a quiet get away, but also a bummer if you didn't plan on driving or taking a taxi, so plan ahead for transporation. The staff was always 2 steps ahead of us when we needed a taxi, which was nice, they would arrange for anything, we were very well treated at this hotel but as I previously mentioned, we weren't there to bother anybody or to nit pick over small details like fingerprints on a glass door.

We have been visiting Key West annually for 8 years and love the relative peace of the Atlantic side of the island. So, unlike some of the previous reviews of this property which comment on its location, this review will discuss only the property itself. We arrived at the resort as the third leg of a week-long, multi-stop vacation and had two fairly large suitcases, with which no one offered to help us when we checked in (no bellman on the curb when we arrived by taxi from the airport), but that was fine. The very first thing I noticed about the property when I walked into the lobby was a ballroom door to the left whose glass panes were absolutely covered with fingerprints (the light was hitting the glass at such an angle that you couldn't miss them). The lovely dark wood floor was also streaked with visible grime. I don't usually look for these things in hotels, and maybe if it the Florida sunlight hadn't been streaming in, I would have missed it completely. But it looked like they had simply neglected to assign a staff member to \"lobby duty.\" I then spotted a welcoming glass jar of icy lime spritzer that was empty (save for a few melty ice cubes and lime wedges) and surrounded by so many used glasses they were covering the entire surface of the small table. I had hoped that this amenity would be refreshed before the check-in process was completed, but it was not. The first room we were given was so small, it was impossible for two people to move around in it at the same time. We were told this was because it was the last available room in the property and we would be moved the next day when another room became available. If possible, I would advise guests to try to steer clear of the tiny, angular \"Flagler Ocean Vista\" rooms the website describes as having \"unique shapes.\" This may have just been the tiniest room in the hotel, but it was so overcrowded with furniture that there was literally no room for our suitcases (there were also no dressers or luggage racks). It also had just one full-size window (and one tiny shuttered one) that looked directly at the side of the hotel. If one bent around the opposite way and stretched to see it, a tiny piece of ocean was just visible beyond the pool area. This lack of natural light made the room very dark. I was disappointed to find a sticky substance on the tiled bathroom floor, to which my rubber-soled flip-flops became stuck. We asked to have this cleaned while we were out, but it was not done. We visited the outdoor bar for a pre-dinner cocktail and were, again, disappointed by the lack of cleanliness. The bar was not particularly busy but the bar surface where we sat was covered with crumbs, which our bartender ignored. He was not particularly friendly and allowed another couple to sit in our stools while we went for a short walk around the pool. The next day, we moved into a much larger, cleaner, and brighter Flagler Ocean Vista Room which faced the ocean directly. While it did not have a dresser or bureau (apparently the designers decided to forgo clothes storage for a \"credenza\" that houses an empty mini-fridge, a wide variety of barware, and some useless shelving), at least there was room to set up 2 luggage racks and move around our suitcases. Adjacent to the bed was a sitting area with a comfortable chair and reading lamp. There was also a wicker settee, which looked sharp and fit nicely into an oddly-configured corner of our room but was in no way a practical piece of furniture (its creamy white upholstered cushion will soon be filthy as guests choose to use it as a suitcase rack). A small dresser would have been a much more practical choice for this space (guests in KW aren't spending much time wearing clothes that need to be hung up in a closet: it's a laid-back town and shorts and T-shirts are the norm). We loved the grounds of the resort. The first day we sat by the water, we were greeted by a friendly staff member who set up our chairs and towels for us. We also had excellent food and beverage service on the beach, with staff checking on us often. The cool watermelon slices and popsicles were a very nice touch that put this property on par with luxury resorts we have visited. On our last day at the property, we decided to try the breakfast. We were seated at a table and directed to the buffet, which was very good. When we returned to our table, however, we had no silverware. After hunting around the buffet and searching for a serving station, none was to be found. We sat, hot food on plates in front of us, for at least five minutes as several servers disappeared to attempt to locate some utensils. This seemed very odd and was quite frustrating, but eventually the issue was resolved and the food was tasty. It may be worthwhile to note that there are many employees of this property who do not speak English. There were several times during our stay (including this breakfast) when we attempted to ask a question of a staff member who did not have even the most basic grasp of the language; this made for some awkward and frustrating moments when we could not get the information we needed. During our last swim in the pool, an attendant came by and removed our towels from our chairs. When we explained that we had planned to use the towels upon exiting the pool, he told us towel service was ending and rudely refused to bring us new towels. We then watched as other attendants brought handfuls of fresh towels out and happily obliged when guests came over to help themselves. This was rather maddening, but not surprising given the highly inconsistent level of service we had received during our stay. In short: the outdoor grounds are top-notch, the rooms are stylishly appointed but lack some practical amenities and come in a wide variety of sizes, the common spaces need much more attention to cleanliness, and the service is very spotty and inconsistent. The Casa Marina has great potential to be a top-notch resort property but it has a ways to go.", "Date": "May 4, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Howell, New Jersey", "Title": "\u201cBeautiful setting\u201d", "Author": "DrAProco", "ReviewID": "UR15553406", "Content": "Key West is lively, outrageous, loud, and fun, so this property a bit of a distance from Duvall Street turned out to be the absolute perfect spot to catch your breath.

Pros: - most important thing was the view of the beach and pool (I wondered how disappointed the people facing the back must have been. on the website the back room are called \"garden view\", but rest assured that there is nothing resembling a garden in the back) - room clean, confortable and spacious - room service pretty efficient - and my feeling going around key west was that there were not many resorts with a private beach, so I guess this is a unique feature of the place. Cons: - the feeling at the end of the holiday is that you are being charged for a luxury resort, but this place, while it is nice, it's nothing near luxury. - The main house, which is the old and charachteristic building is a bit run down (they did say it was going to be renovated...) and when you walk in you can see the glass on the main entrance doors is all dirty with fingerprints. Sorry but this you would never see in a real luxury resort. Fortunately the rooms are much better, but most of them are in the new big concrete building which has no character at all (metal doors etc..). - you are being charged for a tons of little things on top of the room, which is already quite expensive. One thing for example is access to the beach for what they call \"towel service\", regardless of weather you actually went to beach or not and of course you find out only when you check out, which is always unpleasant. Luxury to me means that beach and sunbeds are included in the price. - restaurant food service is extremely slow and totally unprofessional: just to get a table to sit for morning breakfast it takes three people to coordinate. and for lunch you have to wait AGES to be served. - they have a bar on the beach (concrete structure, not the really the typical caribbean palm tree bar), but anyways, if you try to have a drink around 7PM, you find one barman all sweaty and tired beacuse he is working there alone since noon, vomit and alcohol stink all around...I mean I was disgusted!!

The property is beautiful and the staff was wonderful. We were supposed to checkout on the 10th but we extended our stay one extra night because we were unable to book a trip to Ft Jefferson until the 10th (definitely worth one trip to the Ft but book with Yankee Freedom; which you can do online before your trip - we booked through one of the Key West Info huts along Duval St and they failed to mention a fuel surcharge for an additional charge). The Casa is not located in the heart of the action and that was perfect as it afforded us peace and quiet with just a short walk to the heart of Duval. My recommendation is if you plan to shop then I would drive to one of the parking lots (Mallory Square is $4.00 per hour with a max of $32 per day) or bring LOTS of quarters as you only get 10 minutes for each quarter at a parking meter. Otherwise, you should just grab a cab (there is one designated just for the Reach/Casa resorts but it is not complimentary) or walk the short distance with the rest of the crowd. I will admit that I was quite concerned based on all the 2 star ratings I saw prior to my trip and was seriously considering other options. I am so glad that I decided to stick with the Casa. While we were there we bought two seats (called a Split) on the Captain Conch charter boat (which was booked via the hotel's water sports personnel). Captain Jason and First Mate Daryl were great and the 4 hour trip was definitely worth the $149 per person (you also need to tip the First Mate 15-20% so bring cash for that additional charge which the booking agent failed to mention). My son caught a 12 lb Bonita and a 20lb Amberjack - he's hooked (I know, I know) on fishing now and can't wait until he can go again. You take turns with others (kids go first then its everyone for themselves on a rotation that you decide) for each \"downrigger\" that's called and one gentlemen had his dream come true when he caught (& released) a 7ft sailfish. You can keep some of your catches and have a local restaurant cook it up for a fee or you can (and in some cases must) release - which we did with the Amberjack (they kept the Bonita for bait). You can even have a replica or your catch mounted via Gray's at a cost of $200 per ft ( and you must provide a significant depost). Camille's was great for breakfast (and they have whole Key Lime Pies wrapped to go for $20). I wasn't impressed with the Conch Republic's idea of a Filet steak but they had a great gift shop. Lobo's for lunch was good and they have a great bartender who is funny, charming and handsome (he paid me to say those things - just kidding) and indicated he gets a lot of customers based on Trip Advisor's recommendations. Caroline's (Duval St) was good and Sandy's Cafe (on White St) serves Media Noche sandwiches that are as big as the deli sandwiches at Katz's in Manhattan - not the usual thin Media Noche's - you could make two sandwiches from their one. The locals all know and love the place. The Ghost Tour is also a must for a Key West trip (there were people with/without kids).

Overall, the place is nice. They upgraded us to an Ocean View room because they didn't have any lower level rooms left, so that was lucky. The rooms are completely adequate, but I'm not sure that they are completely 'renovated' because there were definitely spots in the shower, the furniture and on the floor that made it seem a bit dated. The walkways have peeling paint and so the rooms in some spots. Maybe we just weren't in the right wing. The cleaning staff is great- they even change the sheets every day! The Nespresso machine in the room is great and so are the ameneties. The view is amazing, as is the pool, the beach and the snack area by the pool. There are plenty of lounge chairs on the beach as well as hammocks. The staff was okay, we never had any problems with them, but they all seemed kind of uninterested in what they were doing. There is really nothing going on at this resort. We wanted to get a drink at the bar at 11pm one night, and the TV was on but no one was home. There were other people with the same idea, but there was no bartender there each night. The place is without a doubt strange and expensive. The small brunch they offer is over $22 per person. Go to Camille's for breakfast and your entire check for two people will be less than that, and you will get much better food. All of the drinks at the Casa are $9 and up, all of the time. Room service is outrageous. We finally bought beer and wine at the circle K and stocked our refrigerator because after a while, $9 drinks add up! We weren't even sure if they offered dinner or not because there were no advertisements or anything. It's almost like no one knows what is going on there, or they aren't interested in sharing it with you for some reason. We just went into town every night for dinner. The elevators were almost always out of order during the day, which made getting around the property kind of a pain. It would also be impossible for an elderly or disabled person to stay here because of this. Overall I would say that we were satisfied with the Casa Marina, but there was nothing that made us want stay there again next year. We ended up spending a lot more money than we would have liked. There are a couple of places down the street that are probably less expensive with more charm and service, and are a bit closer to Duval street as well. The cab rides from the Casa to Duval street varied with cab drivers, which was pretty annoying. It could cost anywhere from $7.00 to $12.50. I say rent a scooter. Definitely stay on this side of the island, though!! We ran the entire island and the other side isn't anywhere near as cute and interesting as the side with the Casa and Duval street. If it's the beach you want and the other places don't offer it, you could just walk up to the beach at the Casa and use it anyway. You could sit there and buy drinks, food, use the chairs, all without being a guest.

The resort has all the watersports that you could want with friendly assistance, but is not inexpensive at all. A jetski rental for a half hour is $70.

It was Easter week, so I expected it to be vvery crowded, but we had a very positive experience. We had 2 adjoining rooms overlooking the ocean and pool. Unlike other reviewers we had great service, whether it was front desk, housekeeping, towel service, lunch, room service, baggage help, consierge - you name it. I even had to call maintanence to borrow a hammer after our stroller broke and the guy came right up. I could always find a chair in the shade, a hammock, a beach chair away from other people. The pools wqere surprisingly uncrowded - the most I ever saw was 15 people in it and 4 were my kids! Usually it was 10 or fewer. The staff cleaned up cups and towels constantly - very clean. They brought around ice pops, lemon water and watermellon. One day when my son missed the pops the guy went back to the freezor and brought one out for him. The breakfast buffet was good - pricey of course. I stuck with the Starbucks - whcih isn't cheap of course, but for a muffin and coffee it's not $21 and that's all I needed. We never waited in line for anything - food, drinks, water sports, bikes etc. The one exception was computers, of which there are only 2 and no free WIFI. We walked to restaurants each night (Blue Heaven was good) and a few sites (Butterfly Conservatory), but mostly just lounged on the beach and pool - we were escaping the snow and cold in Chicago. The beds were comfortable and quiet - I was only bothered once by late night voices in the hall - it was not a spring break party place. I slept great! There were conventions, but they had their own set ups for lucn and dinner and never interfered with our getting chairs or service. Some resortts you can only eat lunch at 11 or 2 to really get seated and served - but we ate with our 4 kids at noon every day - no delay. You seat yourselves too- again no waiting.The mango chicken sandwich was tasty. Not gourmet, but good. You could eat at the tables, on the beach or at the pool. I appreciated the lack or rules - I've been to places where you have to sign out towels, pay for umbrellas on the beach, can't sit in certain reserved chairs etc - there was none of that. I felt very relaxed. It was child friendly too - they had the Easter Bunny and a movie night with popcorn by the pool. It was not overrun with kids, however, so the noise level was fine. There were no lifeguards, which I appreciate b/c I can watch my own kids and don't want to hear whistles or \"WALK please,\" every 5 minutes. There are rafts that the resorts has and the kids loved balancing standing on them - I'm sure lifeguards would have discouraged that. We swam off the pier and over where we rented the boats - the coral was not a concern, although I was glad I'd read about it. And, yes the sand is a bit rocky, but it looks nice and they kept it clean. We were on the 2nd floor and used the stairs (the elevators were slow) and from room to beach chair was all of 60 seconds - very convenient layout. I could watch kids in the pool and on the beach at the same time by sitting in a chair on the boundary of both. One day I had one kid on the room balcony, 2 in the pool and one in a hammock and did not feel overwhelmed - I could see them all! (My hubby went back to a meeting in Chicago for the day). Kudos to Mike at the pool and Patrick at the front desk - always seemed genuinely helpful. The only negatives were: the balconies were separated by canvas dividers - you might as well been sitting with your neighbors if you were out there at the same time. The lack of shower doors did result in some floods with the kids.

And while they did \u00e2\u20ac\u0153fix\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd my problem, they really didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t seem to be too concerned\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6and that seems to be one of the problems with Casa Marina. Casa Marina wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t a horrible hotel but I was disappointed in several aspects including this initial problem with the room. Some of the other problems include: \u00e2\u20ac\u00a2 Elevators with broken plastic buttons, scarred walls, chunks of the floor missing \u00e2\u20ac\u00a2 Dirty scuffed walls in the halls \u00e2\u20ac\u00a2 Very little space for clothing \u00e2\u20ac\u201c a few cubby holes and a small armoire \u00e2\u20ac\u00a2 Scuffed wooden soap holders in the bathroom \u00e2\u20ac\u00a2 The worst is the indifferent customer service. Casa Marina\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s pools were very nice and the beach was serviceable, as long as you understand that Key West really doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have great swimming beaches. The beach bar was nice and\u00e2\u20ac\u201dnot too expensive but once again, not the best customer service. It took at least 5 minutes to be acknowledged. I understand being busy but at least say \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be with you in a minute\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd with a smile. We didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t eat the breakfast buffet or any other food, but lots of people looked like they were enjoying it. There were two weddings going on at the same time. Neither bride seemed upset but I would have been furious. It's not a large hotel, so they seemed to run together. I think if we had paid $250 a night, I wouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have been as frustrated and disappointed but for almost $400 a night, you should get a little more of just about everything!", "Date": "March 26, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "1", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "1", "Check in / front desk": "2", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Delaware", "Title": "\u201cSo much promise.

This property has a lot of promise and under the right management, could be an exceptional property. The staff are very courteous and generally aim to please. The management and execution are another matter. My wife and I arrived with two young children in a rental car. The arrival area was a scene of complete chaos, with nobody directing anything. We had to get our own bags out of the car. The front desk was pleasant and assigned us our room. I double checked to make sure we got the one bedroom suite we had reserved. I was informed that they didn't have any, but would give us two rooms instead. I asked if they were adjoining and was told no they weren't . We worked through this issue and finally got a one bedroom suite after all. The room was nice, except the floors were dirty, one of the tv remotes did not work, multiple lights were burned out, the iron did not work, there was no coffee for the coffee maker...... you get the point. I made a call and all of this was fixed, except for the iron and the tv remote. Multiple requests but neither was fixed. I just gave up. The bed was one of the worst I have ever slept on. Checked with multiple guests and they concurred. Not a good thing to skimp on cost. Service in the hotel was generally good, but spoiled by the apparent lack of management oversight to prevent bad experiences. For instance, we and another family went to breakfast together (party of 9). The hostess area was completely disorganized. A party of 13 came after us, yet they set up a table for the party of 13 and prepared to seat them. I was then approached by another staff member and asked how many in our party. I told them we had already registered as a party of 9. She apologized that it would be impossible to accommodate us outside, but that we would be able to get a table inside with a 15 minute wait. The person with the party of 13 stepped in and told them he had come after us and he said we should be seated first. To make a long story short, myself and the other guy were able to work with the staff to have both large parties seated outside by moving around a few tables (which we did ourselves). BTW, no apologies from any of the staff. Nothing. The waiter was great. We will be coming back to the Keys but we will not be staying at the Casa Marina again.

Gorgeous facility. However, BEWARE of unsanitary glassware (drinking glasses, wine glasses and ceramic mugs) in guest rooms. One morning while my husband was at a meeting, I decided to stay in our room and do some work on our laptop. Hearing the chambermaid out in the hall, I asked that she simply switch our dirty towels with clean towels, as well as replace our dirty drinkware with clean, from the kitchen; she politely obliged. She came into our room as I worked on the computer, but I was soon distracted by the continuous running of water from the bathroom sink: I found her rinsing our dirty glasses in the (dirty) bathroom sink and wiping them dry with a towel. Appalled, and remembering an ABC undercover investigation, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Are Hotel Drinking Glasses Clean?\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd (Feb 12, 2008), I asked her what she was doing; she said she was washing our glasses and mugs. When asked whether or not dirty drinkware from guest rooms are run through the kitchen dishwasher, she said no. When asked why she wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t at least using dishsoap, she said they don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t use any \u00e2\u20ac\u201c just rinse the glasses under hot water. I asked her stop what she was doing and to please bring me clean drinkware from the kitchen dishwasher. She said I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d have to go through the front desk, which I did, but not before I used my computer and googled the Florida Health Dept, called them, inquired of their health code for hotel drinkware (which they have), and filed a complaint. I was told an investigator would soon be paying a visit to the Casa Marina. I shared this information with the hotel manager when I went down to the front desk to request clean glasses. Back at the room, I received a call from the head of housekeeping; he heard we had problem. I informed him of my findings and he assured me that clean glasses are delivered daily to all guest rooms, in exchange for the dirty. Let\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s just say that I was in our room all morning and not once did I hear the clinking sound of glassware exchanging hands from bus boy to chambermaid. Clean glasses were finally delivered to our room from the kitchen (yeah!) but only after a couple more encounters of unsanitary utensils onsite.
