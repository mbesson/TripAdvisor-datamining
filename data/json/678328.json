The first being in March whereby the service and food was fabulous beyond description! The service staffs are polite and the service was as smooth and delightful as the experience the hotel is giving me throughout the night. I totally left with craving for a second time. The second however, just last Saturday, was not as desireable. There was this constant yapping at the side of my table from one particular specy grey suited man. This yapping totally destroyed my evening with old friends and killed off my evening straightaway. There was so many occasion we signalled for service but all the staffs seemed destracted by the guy to notice us. This was not all as I noticed the same guy taking photos around during the dinner! This is invasion of privacy! I thanked the service staff for their hospitality after the dinner knowing that I will not come again in the near future.

But we like to try out new hotels and stayed 3 nights at Fullerton Bay and 1 night at St regis. In 2009 the hotel was shiny and brand new,service was excellent. Our room was made every time we left and a tray of fruit and chocolate was brought everyday at 2pm. Also when we were showed to our room the butler asked if we would like our luggage unpack and when we leave he will pack it for us. Mr. Yngvar Stray,the general manager, was constantly seen on premises and making everything run smoothly and accordingly. We met him and he gave us breakfast everyday comped. Buffet breakfast was wonderful but selections were on the lighter side compare to what they offer today. So now its March 2012,things have changed since then. They have a new GM and we did not see him once. But that wasn't the problem. Checking in process needs to be revamped. There was so no line when we checked in but when we went out later I saw a rope was put up and people waited online to check-in. I would have been displeased that we had to stand to wait on line while people checking in were sitting. They should do away with those desks and put a large check-in area where everyone checking-in had to stand. The 3 years since we've been there,the rooms has taken a beating and it looks as they do not maintain them. The pillows on the chair and sofa were stained and ripped. There was a massive stain on the sofa's red upholstery,the bathroom which is made up beautiful marble of needs a good polishing. The butler service has changed,room was not made up every time we left,no fruit and chocolate plate was brought to our. I asked them about it and the butler made me feel like I had 2 heads and then proceeded to say,\"Oh yeah! I guess they forgot\". The two butlers we met never offered to unpack or pack our suitcase when arriving. This property is still a beautiful and stunning but it has lost some its excellent qualities that made it quite memorable for us. The breakfast buffet is more extensive with a lot to offer then 3 years ago so that was a plus. The staff & service in the dining room is still excellent.", "Date": "April 21, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Seoul, South Korea", "Title": "\u201cA marvellous stay but service can improve\u201d", "Author": "jaejaez", "ReviewID": "UR128271624", "Content": "St Regis Singapore (hereafter SRS) is a luxurious property where they have done a great job of implementing the legacy of Lady Astor of New York with an oriental interpretation. The hardware of the hotel is dotted with ample luxury and refinement and it goes a long way to making your stay special. There are still little misses in terms of service levels, but nothing major to deter the lavish experience that SRS stands to provide. I was at the SRS when it was at its busiest since its birth \u2013 The receptionist actually confirmed this; that they were indeed at their busiest time ever. Carla who checked me in was very friendly and professional but was in such a hurry that she forgot to mention the elite amenities with her radio-earphone ringing into her ear with non-stop calls. I think she wanted to escort me to my room but decided not to when we reached the elevators \u2013 she wished us a good stay from the lift doors and assured us that our butler would greet us in the room shortly. Well, the butler never came until that same evening, some 6 hours later. This brief check-in encounter was actually symbolic to the entire service experience at the SRS for our entire stay. The staff are friendly and genuine but are not as \u2018polished\u2019 in their delivery of the actual service. The door-men, for example, were helpful and charming when we engaged them but when we didn\u2019t they were busy in their private chatters whilst the guests walked right by them. Not a big deal \u2013 I do not need to be greeted with a \u201cwelcome back\u201d like they do at the Shangri-la - but certainly a sight unfit for the name of a St Regis. The breakfast service was equally friendly but lacking in efficiency. We had our breakfast at the ballroom since the restaurant closed. I ordered eggs at the egg-station and was told to wait in my seat and that the eggs would be delivered but they never arrived. When I went back to check some 5 mins later, my eggs were already cooked and placed on the side and\u2026 forgotten about. The lady apologized and offered to make new ones but I politely declined and brought back my not-so-hot eggs. Friendly? Yes. Efficient? Not really. The same was seen at the drawing room during the platinum happy-hour. The lady who seemed to be a manager was evidently \u2018training\u2019 one of the gentlemen in handling the electronic register, that it was extremely difficult to get either of their attention. When I did get their attention, they were attentive but it got frustrating after a while in having to wave our arms so much that I found myself getting up to walk up to them to make my orders. Friendly? Yes. Delivery? A B- grade at best. Perhaps the only saving grace in terms of service was the butler service which I found to be quite prompt and service-oriented. Wilbur, in particular, was evidently more seasoned than the other butlers at the SRS and he made me feel at ease with the requests. Unfortunately, this butler service alone was not enough to salvage the general unpolished service levels at the SRS. Having said that, the service levels were not bad per se, just a tad under-whelming for a property carrying the St Regis flag. Aside from these service-level misses, everything else was fit for a St Regis brand. Many have concerns over the design aspect of the rooms at the SRS but I actually found it charming. Bathrooms are made of marble with great showers and a wonderful deep-soak tub. The pool & spa was a welcoming space and I did enjoy the artworks around the property very much. Do not pass by all the paintings mindlessly but take time to check the artists\u2019 names\u2026 you may be in for a pleasant surprise! (Here is a challenge, look out for originals by Picasso and Miro!) Location-wise, the hotel is perfect if you are looking for proximity to the shopping haven of Orchard Road whilst being far enough to be in a quiet location. Next to the SRS is the Tanglin mall where you can find restaurants as well. The ION Orchard (center of gravity for shopping in Singapore) is about a 15 min walk \u2013 and given it is a walk along the Orchard road it is a pleasant one. It is also a stone throw away from the American/Australian/UK embassies and the royal botanic gardens is also within walking distance. Although not as \u2018central\u2019 as say, the Hilton or the Marriot (both of which are in the middle of Orchard Road), I did find the location \u2018right\u2019 for me. I should also mention the Astor Bar at the SRS. It is worth mentioning for two things, the jazz musicians that play at night and its very impressive wine collection. Whether you are looking to share a casual glass of Chardonnay with SGD 100/bottle or a lavish night of splurge with a 1996 Chateau Rothschild Lafite (five digits SGD) and everything in between, you will find them here with a smooth live band under a luxurious setting. I would highly recommend that you stop by for at least one night, pour yourself a red, admire the artwork from your luxurious furniture with soulful jazz surrounding you and\u2026 a service level from the bar staff that is friendly but very slow (again\u2026 the service issue).", "Date": "April 21, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "New York", "Title": "\u201cGreat hotel, ok location.\u201d", "Author": "Jennyp622", "ReviewID": "UR128233212", "Content": "if your plan in Singapore is to only shop-this is the place for you. we were a group of friends traveling so it was far from the marina/casino and restaurants Excellent mix of luxury and art though.

The overriding impression that I've taken away from my stay is the hotel's lack of consistency that abounds in every area and customer touch point. If a hotel is going to bill itself as a luxury 5 star property and commensurately charge room rates and F&B prices in line with a luxury experience then it must perform. Sadly this hotel failed to provide a price/value relationship or a memorable positive impression. High Points: 1. Steve and George at the Remede Spa were highly professional and provided an amazing experience and a very high level of service. Low Points: 1. Upon my arrival two of the three check in desks were manned and I stood in what felt like the middle of the lobby waiting for someone to check me in. No one offered me a drink or a seat. At lesser hotels I've been escorted directly to my room and the check in process handled out of the view of public inspection. 2. The overall quality of the F&B at breakfast, dinner and room service was mediocre. Add to the average food less then average service. Not once in the 5 mornings that I had breakfast in the hotel did anyone remember that I drink a flat white and offer to bring me my coffee, nor did anyone every come back to ask if I wanted a second cup of coffee. 3. The wall sconce light fixture over the night table on the right side of the bed was missing the decorative crystal base and was a mismatch to the light fixture on the left side of the bed. 4. The door on the decorative wood cupboard that housed the small frig and in room bar was broken and did not close properly and remainder ajar during my entire stay. Points 3 and 4 may seem petty, if i was staying at a 3 star hotel i would not bother to mention them but this is a 5 star property and the lack of attention to detail is not acceptable. 5. Breakfast on Saturday and Sunday was not served in the restaurant, instead it was served in one of the Ball Rooms and was a 3 ring circus disaster. I was not given any prior warning that the venue had moved. As a courtesy to guests I would have at least expected a note from the general manager delivered to my room informing me of the change and offering me the option of room service. 6. Very young inexperienced staff. The highly touted butler service that the St. Regis is supposed to be know for was less then stellar. I don't think I had the same butler more then once. When I stayed at the Alvear Palace I had the same 3 butlers on a rotation who sat at a desk on my floor in the lift lobby and greeted me every time I went in and out of my room.

As we are residenced in Singapore and did not have time to take a trip abroad for the long- weekend, we decided a night at this luxuirous hotel would be a nice getaway for a comfortable stay. Check- in and the butler service were in-line with a quality 5- star hotel. The room was very spacious while the bathroom was amazing. The stand-alone tub, the ample space, and modern shower made it the best bath I have ever had. There was a complimentary wine- tasting in the Decanter bar that was a nice touch though, we were limited to three glasses that needed to be picked on the spot. Also, the cheese selection was okay but I suspect this was down to one of the other parties taking heaping plates of whatever was on offer. The Astor Bar is a cool place to have a cocktail and a chat. Good mix of old & modern ambiance. The staff were superb including the butler that was very professional and seemed to be very proud of his the service he offered. My main gripe about all of this was the food- the breakfast buffet and the dinner - a combination of room service and food sent up from the French bistro located in the lobby. The breakfast buffet was good but, it was clear that during the facade cleaning and other maintenance, the rate was lowered per night for the weekends and the breakfast moved to one of the conference or ballrooms. While this was still more than sufficient (the food quality was good), the choices were quite low in quantity and very generic for Singapore 5-star hotels. This was not even close to Shangri- La's \"The Line\" even though the St. Regis has much better cosmetic appeal. The room-rate I was charged indicated breakfast would be at the Brasserie Les Saveurs restaurant or the Italian restaurant. While I was aware of the Italian restaurant being under renovation, at check-in we were nonchalantly told breakfast would be in a large general area. I had heard pretty good things about the buffet breakfast and was disapppointed to find that the experience would be downgraded. Also, we ordered dinner in our room from Brasserie Les Saveurs. While it was fantastic for the butler to have this arranged, the food quality was not good. Yes, hotels tend to charge more for food services (as evidenced by our SGD 29.00 paneer makhani from room service that was passable), but the dinner from Brasserie Les Saveurs was totally unacceptable. There are at least 4-5 similar type of restaurants scattered throughout Singapore that charge less for the same or specific items AND provide better quantity and quality. It's not even close. I assumed this would be the case but, my partner convinced me that a hotel of the quality that St. Regis posses would provide good good as compared to say a four- star hotel or even some of the so-called 5- star hotels in town. This assumption made total sense but in hindsight, I feel as though we should have went along with my original plan of buying the similar food at one of the other French restaurants/bistros in town + Indian food from near our residence in Singapore and packing it up for dinner. Everything was fantastic apart from the food. While this may seem trivial to some, this is a 5 start hotel and every aspect of the stay evidenced this apart from the dining. I was looking forward to a good meal for dinner and at breakfast but, I was disappointed as I only had one day to use for my holiday and was misinformed when I booked the room about the breakfast offering. The breakfast buffet was loud (service was good- but eggs took 20 minutes for over-easy) and had a feel of a huge cafeteria with carpeting. Overall, this was a unique and comfortable stay but it could have been better. We seemed to be warned on number of occassions that the hotel was full. Understandable, but not an excuse to scrimp on some services such as dining.

The suite had a living room with a seating area to hold 7-8 guests. i had some guests (family of my fiancee, party of five) who came to celebrate the special occasion with us , and I wanted to get them some hot beverages. As such, I followed the instructions that came along at the wet bar and contacted the In Room Dining to proceed ordering. I was informed by the staff that attended to me that we were only entitled to two orders, that of the registered guests plus one. He added that the policy states that the other drinks ordered will be chargeable. However, this was not what I understood based on the instructions at the wet bar (no instructions that said we could not order beyond 2 guests, and nothing about being chargeable). Given that the hotel gave free flow of cold beverages from the mini bar, I was perplexed why this did not apply to the hot beverages as well. At the spur of my frustration, I questioned the staff: if I had wanted to try a variety of drinks, would the same policy apply. He said that if that was the case, I would \"only be allowed to order once every few hours\". I was appalled at his reply, and did not expect such a service level from a six-star hotel. I then requested to talk to the director of hotel rooms, Mr Ian Tan. The staff mentioned that he would get Ian to call me.After 15 minutes, I did not hear from Ian, and as such, I gave them a call again. Another staff picked up the call, and when I told him that I was waiting for Ian's call, he asked for the reason behind that. I quickly recapped what happened, and was given a similar reply. Frustrated, I ended the call after hearing the same reasoning.A few moments later, our butler came into the room with the original orders that they allowed. I explained our situation to him, and he said he could waive the charges for us. I was pleased with his attempt at service recovery, and I thanked him for his good service.Shortly after, the manager-on-duty called and reiterated the hotel's policy. He also mentioned that other hotels would have done the same by providing drinks for registered guests plus one. That was not what I experienced in other hotels though. He later added that since it was my big day, he would make an exception by waiving the charges of the additional beverages.Paying for the additional charges was not the bulk of the problem. I was upset that after paying so much for the room and the flower arrangements in St Regis, this was the service I had received from the In Room Dining team.Thankfully, our butler came in with all our orders, and included a box of chocolates, which was thoughtful. The butler really helped turned the situation around. We were initially considering having our wedding at the St Regis, but after such an unpleasant encounter, I think I would have no choice but to choose another hotel. There were two things that really upset me. The manager on duty said that I would be receiving the same treatment at other hotels. However the reason why i choose this hotel to have my engagement was because I strongly felt St Regis wouldn\u2019t be like any other hotel but offer superior service as compared to its competitors. I was disappointed. Secondly, after emailing them about this and waiting a week for a reply, I have received none.

U gonna be all sweaty by the time u reach ION. I would love to suggest creating a shuttle to and fro or just one way to ION or anywhere along the shopping strip. St. Regis should know what type of clientele that they are expecting, and I bet they often see their guests coming back in with many shopping bags along (me). W Hong Kong, for example provide shuttle service to Tsim Sha Shui for their guest. I think most guests in SR would definitely love SR more if there's such service :) Service, as expected from the SR name. I won't say the best, but improvements are always there. Most staffs are helpful and gracious. Doormen are always cheerful, and receptionists are always smiley. Rooms are large, and the butler service are quite fast. However the housekeeping seems to be on the 'stingy' side replenishing.

Generally i do not have many things to complain, if it would be a standard hotel. But for this price class, i expected much more and was disappointed. Even if they are small things, but in a luxury hotel this should not happen. Sheraton is much better and has much lower prices and better services. Room: nice and functional, except the Air Conditioning, which is never had the set temperature and was always to cold. Set 23 degree and actual 20 degree. So a few minutes on and then need to switch off manually. Perfect lightening, even a little complicated with the control panel and also the master switch, is not switching off the bathroom so need to be switched off separately. Service: generally good to perfect with many details: The entrance door needs to be opened by your own, as there is nobody at the night. When i had a problem with the electric curtain, the first day, nobody repaired until i was home in the evening and the second day the room maid, said that it needs to be repaired and somebody will come immediately. After 2 hours i went sleep and put the sign Do not disturb, as nobody was coming, Even if the sign was there the door bell was ringing, i guess from the maintenance stuff. Food: There was a canap\u00e9 for platinum members and the choice of food is very poor compared with another hotel from SPG. Breakfast: We need to queue for getting a seated as the restaurant was overcrowded and this should not happen in such a hotel. If i am in vacation, that is not a problem, but in a luxury hotel, you need to guess 30 minutes, this is not expected at all. Further (it was 30 minutes before closing time) some kind of food was not anymore available or needed to be waited for a long time. (egg app. 10 minutes, Bacon was not available, butter was not available) I think, for this price and for the name St, Regis this should not happen and disappointed me totally, especially as i came too late to my appointment due to this reason. Also i was seated to a small table and when i came back, the table was occupied from somebody else and i needed to wait for another table, with the food in my hand. The selection and quality of the food is average. Finally i am platinum member and not had the choice for the wanted amenity at check inn, nor was upgraded, even if there, according to the hotel site, there was all rooms categories available. (or maybe i did not recognized, that the room was upgraded, as i am not used to this hotel and only has the feeling) Finally: it is a good hotel with nice rooms, but not worth the money for a luxury hotel. If it would be a 3 star hotel I would rate the hotel as \u201cperfect\u201d, but not a higher standard.

The lobby is impressive and the quality of furnishing throughout is top notch. As a platinum member I was expecting a special check-in desk but there was none. However I did not need to wait much. I asked for the Butler service as it is advertised and they make such a fuss about this, however, and despite my platinum status I got no Butler. The front desk personnel were lost as nobody was answering their calls. It was Saturday afternoon and there was no Butler to be seen. Eventually he appeared unexpectedly in my room one hour later and I was already unpacked so I sent him packing (if you pardon the pun!). So I cannot comment on this service other than I have the feeling that not getting this service is quite normal. It feels like they are under-staffed and for such an expensive hotel this is not good. In the evening while I was going back to my room and was alone in the elevator, a porter entered with a huge trolley packed with over 10 suitcases. He almost crushed me in the elevator and I felt this was completely wrong. Why would they send trolleys with guests as opposed to using a service elevator? I noticed they were hogging 2 elevators with trolleys and they were not paying any attention to all other guests trying to get into them. It felt like a 3 star hotel at an airport and for over $500 for a standard room this is unacceptable. I brought this to the attention of the Duty Manager who, besides saying how sorry they were, she did not give any explanation regarding why they are using guests elevators instead of service elevators for luggage. She looked puzzled like this was the norm and natural to squeeze guests and trolleys in an elevator and at the same time (not even waiting for the next one) I noticed that all the Staff were very young and they looked also very inexperienced which would explain part of this, but it does not explain that a luxury brand like St. Regis would treat guests like this. The double room was very nice with a superb bathroom full of marble and luxury furnishings. Great looking classic lamps throughout and all in all looking expensive. Only issue that I can say about the room is that you need an engineering degree and loads of patience to manage the control panel for the lights, curtains and the rest. I could not turn off the lights at night. and finally had to go to the entrance and switch off the master control. Reading other reviews at Tripadvisor I can see other people experienced the same. They should have someone coming with you to your room to explain it all, but as explained before no Butler and not even a porter helped me with this.

This time I wasn't so sure. On the positive side, the hotel is well located with large comfortable rooms and impressive public spaces. The standard of fittings in the rooms is extremely high. The brasserie (in fact more like a smart French restaurant than a brasserie) is excellent and the wine list especially good. But the experience of staying there as a guest was very mixed. Check in was chaotic. As the electronics in the rooms are surprisingly complicated to operate (I still had not mastered the lights after two days staying in the hotel and despite the help of three pages of notes on \"Technology and Telephone\" in the directory of services), it would be better to show guests to the rooms rather than just directing them from the lobby. A request for a soft feather pillow was followed by a long wait and then the delivery of a hard foam pillow. The restaurant was full at breakfast this morning and so I was asked to sit in \"the Drawing Room\" (part of the lobby) to eat breakfast. The breakfast buffet was crowded and poorly laid out.

I believe they commissioned an American architect and the decor is very nice. They use a lot of deeper and richer colors and it gives off a sense of class. Unfortunately, St. Regis' service is unable to live up to the expectation that St. Regis' pricing and decor set. My wife and I stayed one night in a suite, but we encountered the following difficulties: - My father wasn't able to check-in to his own room until after 4:30pm (with an inflexible check-out time of 12pm, this is crazy) - I asked for a butler to come move several bags from my father's room to my suite (St. Regis touts 24 hour dedicated butler service. As my dad joked - it takes 24 hours for the butler to come), he comes almost half an hour later, and offers the following explanation for the tardiness: The hotel is at full occupancy, also, the St. Regis hosts many VIP guests, such as a lot of royalty from Dubai. This infuriated me for two reasons: Firstly, I don't know how a high class hotel such as the St. Regis is going to tell me that they don't have the manpower to deal with full occupancy. It's obvious they don't have the manpower because their housekeeping is unable to turnover the rooms until almost 5pm on a weekday. In another tripadvisor review, I saw one of the manager responses quote \"full occupancy\" as a source of their problems. Hey St. Regis - You're a premier hotel, and you need to start filling out your staff to be able to meet the demands of a fully occupied hotel. I imagine that's business 101. Secondly, I don't need to be told there are more important people than myself staying at the hotel. Please don't insinuate that my time is worth less than someone else's time because of their pedigree or wealth. If you expect royalty to be highly resource intensive, you need to hire new staff rather than take away staff that would otherwise be serving me. I pay way too much for that sort of treatment. - I called the front desk to send up a transformer because I needed it urgently. They called me back 20 minutes later saying they don't have one available. If I need one \"urgently\", please at least check to see if you have one so you can let me know asap that there is none available. I would have found other ways of solving my problem. This one ended up being a massive pain in the neck and cost me 20 minutes that I didn't have. - And here's the worst story of the night: It was actually my wedding night and my wife and I retired to our suite at 12:30am after spending the end of our wedding night out with family. We wanted a nice bottle of wine to just settle down and and relax. The room service menu had a few selections of wine but stated that it has a more extensive list upon request. I called downstairs to have the list sent up, and 10 minutes later, f&b calls me to say that I have the menu in the room. I ask, \"is it the one in the room service menu?\" She responds, \"Yes that's the one.\" I inform her that it says there's a more extensive list available. She says she will get it to me right away. Another 10 minutes pass and I call again, they said it's coming up. Half an hour after the initial call, the menu still has not arrived. Infuriated, my wife and I just walk out, and the only option we find is 7-11. So rather than a nice meal and some nice wine to end the night, we end up with 7-11's finest, as well as a bag of Lay's Sour Cream & Onion. It wasn't exactly the way we wanted to end our wedding night, and really it was all due to St. Regis' ineptitude. - There were a few minor technical problems as well including running out of tissue, faulty light (that the technician actually took out the entire bedside console to try and fix, and ended up resetting electricity to our entire room for). - To end on a bright note, the shower was pretty amazing. I wouldn't recommend this hotel to anybody. Not just because of a bad personal experience, but because the service received fell so short of what you expect at the price point. I've stayed in motels with much snappier service than the St. Regis.

The positive. This is an imposing & immaculate hotel in a good (not great) location on Tanglin Road. Walking to the Orchard MRT station takes about 15 minutes. However, taxis are cheap and plentiful and the hotel doorman are very efficient and helpful. The public areas were very impressive, and the pool area is very inviting with a long but relatively narrow pool surrounded by jacuzzi jets and wet beds. We were not upgraded as the hotel was full, but the \"standard\" room was a good size and extremely well appointed & luxurious. The bathroom was particularly impressive with the best shower I have ever had, the Remede soaps and gels are my favourite from any hotel brand too. The in room butler service was excellent, prompt and professional. We took advantage of the on-demand teas and the St Regis bubble bath. It is also worth mentioning the benefits if you are a Starwood Platinum Guest - cocktails and canapes by the pool, wine appreciation, breakfast & the usual free internet. We were also extended a 5.30pm check out. So, what wasn't up to scratch for a six star hotel? In short, some of the service was well short of the best hotels I have stayed in. Three examples: On check in I would expect to be taken up to the room & shown the various controls - this happens at hotels such as The Peninsular & Savoy. Here we were shown the lift, but had to ring for the butler to show us around the room. Only a small point, but at this level one that makes a difference. We had a problem with the air conditioning in the room & not only did it take four phone calls before it was properly sorted, but promised calls back to me to tell me what was happening didn't happen - something I would expect in a four star hotel. The service at the pool was poor, people were gesturing at staff in the italian restaurant for service, and the towels weren't frequently put out on the beds, or dirty ones removed. Shame, because this is a great pool. The staff in the restaurant didn't seem to know about the Platinum Starwood canapes and on both days I had to go and find someone to explain why I was waiting.

As Starwood Preferred Guest Gold Member, we expected an upgrade but did not get one; however, we did not notice any separate Starwood Preferred Guest floors so it is possible that no upgrades are available to Starwood Preferred Guests. Here's a breakdown of what we thought about our stay: 1. Room: Beautiful. Spacious bathroom and convenient automatic shades and lighting system. The king-sized bed was extremely comfortable as were the gorgeous bedsheets. Two complimentary water bottles were provided along with a small box of St. Regis chocolates. The shower was amazing. Perfect water pressure. 2. Butler service: Convenient and easy. We were greeted after checking into our room by a butler which was a nice personal touch. We used the service twice to order freshly brewed coffee and tea to our room. It was delivered promptly with impeccable customer service. 3. Wi-fi: No free wi-fi available even in the lobby. We were a bit surprised about this as we have never been to a Starwood property in Asia without any free-wifi in public areas. If I remember correctly, each hour of internet usage in the rooms was about $10 but daily packages were also available. We used the Business Center to access the internet but found this lack of free wi-fi service in public areas to be inconvenient and below expectations of a luxury hotel. 4. Business Center: Located to the left of the check-in desks, the Business Center is equipped with one Apple computer and two PCs. Printing was fairly easy and we did not have any trouble using a computer as there was never more than one other person using the Business Center. 5. Location: Convenient but not as convenient as other hotels such as the Hilton and the Marriott (both are located on Orchard Road). The hotel is about a 5-minute walk to Orchard Road and about 10 minutes from Ion. 6. Concierge: Memorable but for all the wrong reasons. We asked the concierge (one of whom is a Clef d'Or) for two things: (i) the nearest place to do yoga; and (ii) the nearest HSBC Premier Banking Branch. For the yoga request, the concierge told us that he would have to check around to see which yoga places allow drop-ins, which made me raise an eyebrow since most yoga places all allow for drop-ins unless it is a boutique yoga place. The concierge told us that he would leave us a detailed message to our room re: yoga. As for our second request, the concierge took out a map and circled the place where he said we can find a HSBC Premier Banking Branch. When we arrived back to the hotel room 5 hours later, there was no message from the Concierge re: yoga places nearby. I had to go downstairs again to speak to the same Concierge to inquire about whether or not he could tell me the nearest place to do yoga. When I asked him, he stated that one yoga place he found had a waiting list and that the earliest time I would be able to do yoga was in 3 days. I asked him for the name of the yoga place as I did my research online about places to do yoga in and around St. Regis. He replied \"Pure Yoga\" and I looked at him in disbelief and stated that Pure Yoga has classes almost every hour and that it doesn't make sense that I would have to wait 3 days to do one yoga class. He then quickly picked up the phone and said he would check Absolute Yoga which was located right next door. After speaking on the phone, he found out that I would be able to do a drop-in class the next day at 12:15 pm at Absolute Yoga. I thanked him but felt quite annoyed at his lack of professionalism, knowledge and service. In addition, my husband went for a walk to find the HSBC Premier Banking Branch using the map that the Concierge provided and came back only after finding out that the place that the Concierge circled on the map was not a HSBC but the British Council building. He then went down to speak to the Clef d'Or about this error and was instructed to go across the street from the British Council building. My husband made a second trip based on the Clef d'Or's instructions but again he returned in frustration because he did not find a HSBC Premier Banking Branch but a HSBC ATM machine. Later that evening, my husband and I went for a stroll and discovered that the HSBC Premier Banking Branch is located near the Shaw Center which is nowhere near the two places that the Concierge and the Clef d'Or mentioned. We returned to inform the Clef d'Or the whereabouts of the HSBC Premier Banking Branch. He did not seem apologetic at all which was annoying given the amount of time my husband spent on looking for the Banking Branch. We were surprised and deeply disappointed by this lack of knowledge and service from the St. Regis Concierge and its Clef d'Or!!! As avid travelers, we've come to rely on and trust all Clef d'Ors in luxury hotels for their knowledge, customer service and experience in assisting travelers with their needs. Perhaps St. Regis should consider educating its Concierge about the whereabouts of certain key places that guests frequent so that they stay up-to-date with the exact locations of such places. Overall, the experience was not all worth the hype of a St. Regis hotel. This is our first time staying at St. Regis and we likely will not be choosing St. Regis over other luxury hotel brands as we felt that the customer service was lacking and the overall experience was not entirely pleasant.", "Date": "February 10, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Gaborone, Botswana", "Title": "\u201cFine\u201d", "Author": "Adam_in_Africa", "ReviewID": "UR123906213", "Content": "Stayed here for one night as part of a 2-week honeymoon.

The first time I checked in to this hotel, the doorman greeted me politely, asked for my name, discreetly informed his other colleagues via the wireless and everyone was addressing me by my last name throughout my stay. SPG Plat members could order any one drink off the menu at the very chic Astor Bar. The butler service was professional and prompt. Those things, and other attention to fine details, brought me back time and again, on both business and personal account. I believe in good service and willingly pay for it out of my wallet. Service has dropped steadily over the year as the hotel started to fill out and I presume with staff turnover. To their credit, St Regis has always tried to improve and given time, rectify the situation (seasoned guests: Remember how long the breakfast line at La Brasserie was in the early years). But this has to be the worse service I have encountered. The reception was cold and scripted. There was no more the warmth and friendliness from the previous year. \"The best room\" they can offer me, which is an SPG Plat upgrade as I am informed, is on the 4th floor, just above and facing the swimming pool. Nothing else is available for the duration of my stay (2 nights). After pressing a little, a higher floor room was offered, but was made to wait for more than an hour, with no offer of coffee or tea. The SPG Plat drinks are now at the poolside bar and now restricted to house pours. Look - If you are lucky to get an experienced reception staff to check you in or can stomach the average service of a newbie, the rooms are pretty new and pretty nice.

We had breakfast at the hotel and the standard of food and service was again top class. For anyone capable of walking this hotel is not far from Orchard Rd shopping malls including the large ION complex which was an 8 minute walk for us. That also brings you to the MTR. On check out we asked the staff whether they could package and post an item that was too long for our luggage. Kelly went to a great deal to check with the airline and verify that we would be able to take the item on board at no cost.

The good: Great location, very nice pool area, very friendly door people, helpful concierge (assuming you are not calling), good food selection, great vibe bar (albeit expensive), nice spa, free wine tastings every night at 530 pm, quiet rooms (or being a top notch hotel if you are beside screaming kids you can get moved most likely as I had to do once). The bad: Calling your butler can be an exercise in futility, calling room service can be an exercise in futility, getting what you ordered for breakfast can be a problem and require sending someone back for what they didn't get, something always seems to be wrong in the room (this trip for instance its a leaky something in the bathroom by the sink as well as a sink stopper that required reattachment to work). I wouldn't hesitate to come assuming you are getting a good rate but if you are paying rack (I am currently getting corporate), I am not sure its worth the premium to other alternatives. I really like it, I just wish that they would get their butlers to be around to answer phones (same with the in room dining) and maybe do a bit more checking for faults in the rooms.

The hotel was obviously a big change from the Value Hotel and that alone may have accentuated its luxurious aspects because I definitely had the feeling that this hotel was a very nice luxury property throughout my stay here. Arrival Experience I arrived quite early by taxi, at around 10am and my room was not yet available, nor should that be expected at that hour and in any case, I had not informed the hotel of my early arrival time. However, my room was still ready by 11:30am, which was much earlier than the official check-in time. The doormen here were not the best, they didn\u2019t appear to be all that friendly. Check-in was friendly and I was basically checked-in even though my room was not available. The process took a while and although the attendant was amicable and the general idea was to have a relaxed and informal process, I thought that the process just took a little too long. The Room Upon entering the room, an immediate impression was created of quality, which applied to the materials and to the overall fit and finish in the room. There was a heavy bathroom door, all of the furniture was of a good quality. The wardrobes had solid and thick quality doors. The coffee table was also solid and of a good quality. The chandeliers in both the main living room and also the bathroom were also noteworthy in terms of their quality. Even the room directory and notepads were presented in thick and quality covers, which was generally the theme throughout the room. The hotel is located close to the busy Orchard Road, it\u2019s actually on Tanglin Road but very close to Orchard Road and there was traffic directly opposite my room but the soundproofing was excellent and I could barely hear a thing from outside my room. The view outside of the park opposite was also quite nice and there were also a few interesting apartments and condominiums as part of that view. The bed in the room was very comfortable and I found it to be quite firm. The pillow was quite soft and the linens were very comfortable on the skin. I thought the bed was just right for me and better than the heavenly beds from the Westins which I had experienced previously in both Sydney and Kuala Lumpur. The only bed that I can definitely recall which really bettered this one so far was at the Peninsula in Shanghai, although there may been other beds which were just as good or very slightly more comfortable. The lounge sofa in the room was very nice, soft and comfortable. The TV provided was very large and offered good visual and sound quality. The sound was actually a Bose surround-sound system. The curtains were automated but there seemed to be a problem here, as they were not completely blackout and unfortunately let in a little bit of light during the day. The bathroom was of an outstanding quality, with excellent and pleasing marble being used throughout. There was a TV in the bathroom with good sound quality as well. Materials used throughout the bathroom were impressive, everything from the taps to the showerheads and the freestanding bath itself were of excellent quality in terms of presentation and also function. The work-desk area used a comfortable and soft chair but it was not the usual ergonomic mesh chair that is usually found in this area in many hotels, probably because such a chair would not have suited the character of the room. The room deployed auto-lighting functions with various preset options. The buttons were all soft touch and the progressively dimming and brightening functions were good. I have included videos of the hotel room on my hotels page, the link is within my profile section. Location and Public Areas The location of the hotel was quite convenient, being quite near the main part of Orchard Road with its various shopping malls and also the MRT station in that area. However, it was not actually in that great a location relative to the many other hotels on Orchard Road for those inclined to do shopping or wanting to be near the Orchard MRT station. The St. Regis was a bit further away from the action compared to the other big names in the immediate area. The public areas of the hotel were generally opulent and nicely decorated, with a very nice lobby and lifts. There were also numerous quality artworks on display and the general impression of luxury was definitely present. Service Generally, the service at this hotel was very good, including from the butler service, the room service personnel, the sauna and staff facilities staff members and most of the staff who answered the phone. There was just one occasion where the phone to the butler line took a while to answer and the attendant didn\u2019t seem too pleased upon answering, perhaps a shortage of staff at that point in time. Another issue, if it could be called that, concerned delivery of my requested newspapers, which I actually asked for quite late in the evening and it took some time to deliver those, about thirty minutes. However, I suppose it was an odd request at that time of the day. Other requests such as for the complimentary welcome kit were met quite quickly and I requested additional chocolates. I was able to try out the Jacuzzi and steam/sauna facilities which were all very nice and new. The attendants were helpful and the general quality of these facilities was probably second in my experience only to those at the Landmark Mandarin Oriental in Hong Kong and were slightly better than the W in either Hong Kong or Taipei. Even the robes provided were of a nice and fluffy quality. The spa products used were generally the same Remede products provided in the rooms themselves, which were of very good quality. Breakfast was held in a large and opulent dining area on the ground floor with a very high atrium and generally the food quality was very good but there wasn\u2019t a huge selection available. Some of the buffet containers were quite difficult to operate. The seating in the area was very comfortable, the area was spacious and it felt much more like a spacious lounge than a dining area. I tried in-room dining twice and the food was excellent on both occasions with friendly attendants bringing the food and setting up the table. Conclusion Overall, in considering the various components of this hotel, it seemed to offer a very good combination of excellent rooms and public areas together with solid staff service. The location was also quite good and the rates at the time were also competitive for a hotel of this calibre. Perhaps having just stayed at the Value Hotel Thomson, the St. Regis may have seemed more outstanding but I still think it would be very good in any situation or environment and helped to continue to affirm the quality or luxury hotel proposition in my mind.

This time let's just say all Goodwill has run out. We booked the St Regis Suite with an infant and small child in tow for a short getaway...moving on from the Fullerton Bay Hotel. This is a USD600 a night one bedroom suite. I have never given a hotel a 1-star rating but this one takes the cake. It is shocking. First we were told to check in at 3pm, which by hotel standards is already pretty late. We showed up at 330pm, and were told, after standing in queue to check in, that (surprise surprise) that the \"room was not ready\". Instead of offering us the next available category room, we were told to go to a \"resting room\" and wait. Annoyed we asked why check out is at noon, and at 330pm the room was still not ready- three and a half hours is a long time, is it not, to clean a room? We asked how long the room would take and whether they could offer us another room so that we wouldn't have to move twice. The lady serving at check in kept disappearing for long periods of time behind a door to \"go and check what she could do\", leaving us sitting dumbly at the counter with a long line piling up behind us. What's worse, during her disappearance, with us still sitting at the desk, the receptionist at the next counter hopped over to our counter to serve a different guest. Our receptionist finally re-appeared to firmly repeat that she could only offer a \" rest room\" which was of a lower category and she would \"send us some tea\" while we waited until 5pm for our room. We then lugged our bags ourselves with the help of another lady receptionist to the elevator to go to the \"resting room\". We waited until 450pm, essentially wasting the entire afternoon sitting there waiting... And finally called the reception (waiting a long time for the operator to get through front desk for us), to check on the room. We were told they would \"go and check\"!- no one was pro actively looking out for us. Finally, at 5 a man appeared to help us with our bags... But he couldnt get his key card to make the elevator work.... We entered the lift, tried the card, let him try his card, tried again, then quickly rushed out with stroller, bags, baby, child etc because of the frantic beeping of the elevator... Only to find the same lift was the only one that would come....finally tumbling back in when the bell hop's key worked.... And after much fuss, we finally arrived at our room....to find housekeeping still inside with trash and trolleys and cleaners.... and the rollaway bed which we had requested a day in advance completely forgotten. We went to the pool... Or rather tried to. With no indication in the elevator of what floor the spa/ pool was on, it was up to us to make random guesses as to what likely floor to get off on. Finally, we went to the first floor to enquire and came back up, The deck chairs were all occupied... If not with guests, then with the leftover glasses and towels of guests who had vacated their deck chairs but had not been cleaned up after. We then gave up and returned to our room. We proceeded to the wine tasting and canap\u00e9s which I think are the redeeming features of this hotel- but seriously, we are not reviewing restaurant or wine bars here but a hotel and as a hotel, the failings as a luxury hotel are astounding. The video player was not working, much to my child's disappointment, and the repairman could not fix it... The next couldn't either... Nor the next...and an hour later they all gave up and left. Moving on to the turn down service- what turn down? No one showed up to even replace towels or offer drinking water! The suite itself is nothing to write home about- the bedroom was ok, but the living room was cramped and dim as was the bathroom and the tiny powder-room is best avoided. The dim lighting gave everything a sort of 3 star hotel seedy quality. Where was the body moisturizer? Housekeeping seems to randomly leave some bottles of amenities and forget others, We asked for some money off the room and a late check out in view of the disastrous check in process, which was granted (not pro-actively offered, mind you), but all I could think was \"oh dear, what about the next guest who shows up and finds his room is not ready because we were granted a late check out which overlaps with his check in time...?!", "Date": "January 1, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Danville, California", "Title": "\u201cMy father would only stay here.......\u201d", "Author": "Yew-Joo", "ReviewID": "UR122321593", "Content": "This is the place we would stay every time we go to Singapore.

The St Regis on first impression is that of discreet and understated elegance rather than ostentatious opulence and luxury. Check in is very personalised rather than lining up in front of a desk in most other hotels. Our check in was however somewhat messy and we sat in front of the lady for almost 20 minutes as she tapped away on her computer apparently trying to locate a room even though we had confirmed reservations. We were reassured that the room was available and she was just heckling if the final inspection was done, though at one point we were asked if we had a very strong non- smoking room policy, to which I replied there was absolutely no compromise on that count! We were then ushered to the drawing room for complimentary coffee while she took some more time to get our room which was finally sorted in another ten minutes. Whatever misgivings I had up to this point was instantly forgotten once we got into the room. Wow. It was a large room , with two large double beds and a sedan. There was also a mini alcove with your minibar. The adjoining bathroom was stunning, with a free standing traditional bath tub facing a second flat screen television set, with a His and Hers washbasins, and a separate WC and shower cubicle. The room was equipped with a fantastic Bose surround sound system which could be linked up to your iPod or iPhone . There is no free wifi or internet unfortunately. We took advantage of the complimentary butler service to order afternoon and morning coffee. Yu could also get your clothes pressed and shoes shined if you wanted. There is a complimentary wine and cheese tasting evening session at the Decanter bar which was a very nice prelude to venturing outside the hotel. The hotel is within walking distance to orchard road in one direction and the botanic gardens to the other, but we preferred to avoid the crowds and went instead to the closer Tanglin shopping mall. There is a turn down service in the evening and a selection of Bernard Laurent chocolates left by the bedside . Breakfast was served in a different ballroom as we were there during the Christmas season . I wood rate the breakfast selection as fair and not fantastic, as I have had better in other five and even four star hotels elsewhere. They have an Asian selection and I was disappointed with the porridge which was somewhat tepid as well as the coffee which tastes rather flat. Likewise the gym was very average in my opinion, which left me longing for the one at the Taipei Gand Hyatt. The pool was also somewhat small but nice, with lounge deck chairs partially immersed in very shallow water bordering the main pool.

I had been concerned about some reviewers reporting that the St Regis Butler service was slow and unreliable so I emailed Ian Tan directly and passed on details of my situation. Mr Tan responded and reassured me that the St Regis would be happy to ensure my needs were met and looked forward to my brief stay with them (I was only in the hotel for 14 hours - arrived 5pm and departed 7am). While my original plans had included an evening walk around the Botanic Gardens and maybe Ion in Orchard Road, I was now confined to my room for the duration of my stay and I could not have asked for a better room to convalesce in. I loved the decor (I was in an Executive Deluxe Room that I had got at a special weekend rate - it included breakfast) and the photos on the website are very accurate so if you don't like this kind of Regency decor then don't stay here - I loved the space, the hugely comfortable bed, the couch and window seat, the plasma, the desk, the huge bathroom which most importantly for me boasted a flat walk-in shower, and the walk in robe. The lovely lady who checked me in (at a sit down table in the lobby) showed me to my room (being very patient as I hopped along with my crutches) where I was then met by the floor's senior Butler, Narinda, who gave me his business card and then personally took my order for a much-needed tea, which was delivered, piping hot, only a few minutes later. At check-in I had been offered breakfast delivered to my room the next morning to save me having to negotiate the buffet - it was explained that this would only be the continental breakfast option (ie. not full a la carte choices) but I was very happy with this as I had been worried as to how I would manage a buffet breakfast particularly since I needed to be checked out by 7am. I didn't want to pay for internet so just sent of a few texts to let my family know I'd arrived safely, and then turned on the TV and enjoyed the plush opulence of my room. I ordered a simple tosted sandwich and fries plus dessert from room service (Narinder had organised this for me) and felt very special when he wheeled it in on a beautiful trolley and all meticulously displayed. I never order room service so this was a real treat for me! (BTW - he even knew that this was the start of my special 50th birthday holiday so wished me a happy birthday and a great holiday ahead). I had a wonderful sleep and woke on time and enjoyed some quality time in the fabulous shower (spa jets as well as overhead) and slowly prepared for the next leg of my journey. My wake up call and breakfast were all on time. Check out was simple and pleasant and the staff member who took my small on board case down for me had also organised a taxi - yes it was a Merc, and yes, it cost double the amount my standard taxi had cost from the airport the previous afternoon, but it was so clean and comfortable and I was excited to be off to visit Bali for the first time. I have stayed in 4 different 5 star Singapore hotels and they all had their good points, but for my needs on this occasion - I'm very happy to have chosen the St Regis and wouldn't hesitate to stay there again (Narinder - I still have your business card!).

Still a nice property with very nice rooms and generally friendly staff but all pretty mediocre in that category. The so called 'butler service' is not worth the name and really no different from any other hotel service. In the past they would come and intoduce themselves and offer tea or coffee on your arrival and unpacking service - not anymore. Plus, do not count on being recognized or greeted as a returning guest. When I mentioned to the receptionist that I had stayed there before on sevderal occasions she could only say - oh, we can't see this kind of thing on the system - stone age? No welcome card in the room either. This is all pretty much standard procedure and it just shows lack of attention to basic details when it does not work. When I arrived from a pretty long flight at 6.00 am and had booked from the day before especially just to make sure I could get to my room straight, I was made to wait for over half an hour as the room I had booked was not ready - what if I had checked in the day before as I had payed for?

Stepping into the lobby, we felt like we have arrived on a luxurious destination. The doorman greeted us politely and it was brightly lit and beautifully decorated. Suitably impressed, we proceeded to check in. Hiccup number 1 - no one asked if they may be of assistance. We had to approach the staff. Wasn't it suppose to be the other way round? At check in, we were told our room was not yet ready and to enjoy a drink at the lounge while waiting. Unfortunately, there was no room for us at the lounge and we were ushered to a pair of armchairs at the other end of the lobby, where we were promptly forgottened unti l i went wandering to look for my check in staff. Hiccup number 2! When we got to the room, the Butler very professionally and cordially taught us how to operate the electronic panel and what not. When she departed, we decided to try the lights. Hiccup number 3 - one of the light bulb above the bed blew and was resolutely dark. Never mind, we said. We'll call up Housekeeping. Then, while indulging in the freestanding bathtub, we discovered the TV in the bathroom wouldn't work with controller. Again Housekeeping. Getting out of the tub, we decided to try watching a DVD we brought. Yet again, an issue - the TV went into black-and-white mode! Meanwhile, the electrician still hasn't arrived in all that time we took! Another call to the operator. Finally the technician came and rectified all the issues. Thank God, iwas beginning to think i must have forgotten to slip some money to grease the palms, so to speak. Then came another hiccup. I asked for ice to be in the room as i enjoy chilled water in the evenings. When i got to the room, the ice bucket had not been refilled the entire afternoon and now stood with a lot of water. Was this something very difficult to achieve or am i being unreasonable here? Now came the annoying part. The Butler clearly expects me to tip her even when it was only to ask her to send an electrician over to check the bulb (it blew. Again.) She refused to leave the room until my partner got up and opened the door, all the while staring at my wallet with the notes spilling out. That wasn't very subtle. It was our intention to tip at the end of our stay in addition to instances when we have been satisfied by their services. At this point in time, i was NOT only unsatisfied, i was beginning to lose my patience! The breakfast was lovely, as were the evening wine tasting. We were very impressed with both. The breakfast spread was commendable and our hostess was lovely. Again, the ice bucket was sadly neglected. However, we did enjoy the tea service which arrived promptly and warm,and finally gave a tip to the Butler. Yet at check out the next day, we once again experienced a hiccup. In fact, the entire affair made me adverse to booking another visit for my birthday. We were presented with a bill for a dinner we never ate at the hotel's restaurant. We balked. Thankfully, we had receipts with time stamps showing us at outlets miles down Orchard road at the time the dinner supposedly took place and cannot possibly be at the hotel. The staff was apologetic and, after making copies of our receipts, informed us the charges were waived. Not exactly a wise choice of words there. We requested for notification when the hotel has concluded its investigation but sadly the call never came. We wrote to the hotel weeks after the stay asking for the outcome and were told the staff did try contacting me via mobile. However, i could not be reached. If that were so, shouldn't a followup call have been made, or an email sent? None of these were done. Surely a hotel of such repute ought to be able to do this much without needing prooding from the guest! All in all, a rather bitter-sweet experience with the St.Regis.

Just to stay in St. Regis, even without going out of the hotel, is worth my trip to Singapore. I travel frequently, and once in a while have the privilege of staying in a super luxury hotel, like Burj in Dubai or Peninsula in HK; but non of them give me the effortless perfection and friendly willingness to serve atmosphere that this ST REGIS impressed me with. Let me start from arrival: I arrived extremely early, my flight landed at 6AM, so I get to the hotel around 8AM ( oh, not that airport is SO FAR, I just grab a Starbucks at the arrival ~~ ) I wasn't hoping that they will give me a room since one normally checked in afternoon; besides my husband who booked the room's not traveling with me, he would only arrive much later. But I was warmly greeted and lead to the check-in desk. Instead of the standing up check-in counter, it's much nicer and intimate personal check-in desk like Des Indes in Den Haag. Jude, the receptionist checked me in with all the efficiency and friendliness, our assigned room wasn't ready yet, but he deftly checked other available room and changed the room for me immediately. He didn't question me or insist by rules that I must wait for my husband to arrive before check me in, this I am extremely grateful to him because I was exhausted from the night flight and a bad coughing flu I am experiencing. His assistance and compassion had made the beginning of my Singapore warm and welcoming. Always with a smile, he lead me to the elevator. Once I step into the room, I was over joyed, tastefully decorated classic room, though not as HUGE as the suites in Burj; but it's a very comfortable spacious room. And the free standing bath looks so enticing!!! within 10 mins my door bell rang; and the personal Butler - Sean came to greet me. He \" toured \" the room with me, introduced me to all the facilities in room, checked if every thing is in good order/functional and explained all the offered personal service that I can order through the Butler, such as FRESH TEA & COFFEE on demand, preparing BUBBLE BATH, and other special activities offered by the hotel; WINE APPRECIATION hour at the bar, free DRINK & CANAPE by the pool bar...etc. He was courteous and thorough. He left with my order for fresh tea, and soon the room service lady came back with a silver tray ladened with cups and silver wares and the fresh brewed tea. As soon as she realized that I have a terrible cough, she complied generously to my request with lemon slices and Honey, and brought me many bottle of water for me within 3 mins. Amazing service & speed. We were further impressed at the pool side bar where we were offered selection of drinks and canapes, open & airy, lovely spot to relax; and the waitress were so genuinely motivated at work, when we're leaving, she invited us to return next day for Sunday Brunch with such sincerity. Well done, Rosemarie, your smile is so lovely~ And one must try the bubble bath on demand, yes, of course we can prepare our own, but to have some one pampering you, setting up the bath while you relax on your sofa looking out of the window to the sparkling night view of Singapore; and when informed of the prepared bath in no time and step into the perfect-temperature bath ( I wonder if they carry a thermometer to test the temperature of the water?! ) I really had a feeling of being a PRINCESS ~~ ha ha!!! Well, not to get this review getting to long as it already is. The conclusion is that I had never thought a CHAIN hotel could never be able to offer personal services at this kind of level and apparently I was wrong. I can believe that how much hard work this whole team, from management down to the waiter or house keepers, every one has put in their maximum effort and willing to achieve. Congratulations the team of St. Regis. IF there's anything to complain, I would say only one thing, there's no \"NO CHANGE TOWEL/SHEETS\" cards available. I understand that your hotel opt to provide the immaculate cleanliness room grooming and would spare nothing to change towels and linens even it just have a crease on it. But for the environment, maybe it would be nice to give THE OPTION TO THE GUEST TO CHOOSE TO CHANGE TOWELS DAILY OR TO KEEP THE USED ONES DURING OUR STAY!!! I tried to explained to the house keeping but I don't think they understood, because I still come back to my room every time to see fresh linen and towels every time. Oh, and I didn't get my chocolate again on the second night turn-down service ;) Besides these, every thing's perfect, if I come back to Singapore, there's no other hotel besides St. Regis that I would stay!!!", "Date": "September 15, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Location": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Paris, France", "Title": "\u201cMy favourite hotel without exception!\u201d", "Author": "nikkiq", "ReviewID": "UR118137913", "Content": "This is a wonderful hotel, in a great location, with rock-star service.

This is because I'm such a fan of the hotel. Unfortunately, over the years, the service standard and product offerings at St Regis Singapore had deteriorated so much that I really don't think this hotel deserved all the praises. The feeling I get these days at the St Regis is like opening a Cartier box but only to find a silver ring in it. I have to stress that my review is based on my observation and five stays over a period of time from late 2008 till now. It's Cost Cutting Everywhere Nothing is more atrocious than implementing all the cost cutting measures (especially at the service and product offering) at the expense of the guests. St Regis guests do not pay peanuts to stay at the hotel. Most are discerning guests who do not mind the hefty price but in return would expect immaculate service and good value. Downgraded Bottled Drinking Water One of the things that I\u2019ve noticed is that the hotel has replaced its drinking water in the room from the previous San Benedetto, an Italian mineral water, to a St Regis labeled drinking water. You might ask what\u2019s the fuss over drinking water\u2026 Isn\u2019t it just water? I wouldn\u2019t even bothered about it if not because the hotel is St Regis. You do not expect such standard at a luxurious accommodation. St Regis just lowered its standard. The hotel needs to maintain or even surpass the other premium names. The other compromise is that the in-room selection of complimentary beverages has been reduced quite drastically. What a shame! Where's my Butler? When I first checked into the hotel two years ago, you could feel that you are an important guest and you are well taken care off. But these days, the staff at the check-in desk just checks you into the hotel, gives you the room number and points you to the lift. You can forget the \u201cfamous\u201d butler service. During my last stay, the butler was nowhere to be found. The message is \u201cGo figure it yourself\u201d. Finding the room is not difficult but wait till get into the room\u2026 you will need a manual to understand all the switches. I thought I was the only one who got the service but I noticed that another couple got the same sub-standard service. Boo! So-so Food... cost cutting again?? The restaurants do not fare any better. Okay, maybe with the Chinese restaurant being the only exception. The selection of food has decreased yet I can\u2019t say much about the price. It seems that they are inversely correlated. The Sunday brunch at the Les Saveurs used to have a good selection of food from all the three restaurants in the hotel but the management has removed the selection from the Italian and Chinese restaurants. Frankly, you can get better value food just next door at the Regent Hotel. Their Sunday brunch is about half the price of St Regis but the food selection and quality will impress you. Don\u2019t expect much from the St Regis breakfast as well. To me, it\u2019s just does not live up to the St Regis standard. Let me check! Staff I always remember hotel staff who have rendered good service. I try to do my best to compliment them as and when possible. But I do notice that over the last two years, most of the good staff have left the hotel. These days, you can count using one hand to count the number of excellent staff. Many are just not detailed and attentive. Imagine having to ask the waiter/ waitress to fill your glasses with water during the dinner\u2026 You have to remind them constantly\u2026 it\u2019s either they are too busy or just not concerned. One more thing that really irritates me. In the past, you would get \u201ccertainly\u201d whenever you have a request unfortunately now, you get a \u201clet me check\u201d. What do you need to check? I know you have it in the hotel so just served! Excellent Spa but has its weaknesses The only consolation about the hotel is that they still have an excellent spa (I wonder when the standard is going to fall). The therapists are excellent and their treatments are of first class\u2026 thank goodness for that. Despite the hefty price tag, the mani and pedi cure treatment by the famous Pedi:Mani:Cure Studio by Bastien Gonzalez is to die for. The only drawback is that the male spa and pool attendants are not detailed and attentive. It\u2019s not uncommon that you find empty bottles of shampoo, conditioner, and shower gel in the cubicles, used drinking glasses in the spa, unfilled water jar, etc. I\u2019ve noticed that the spa attendants would just walked pass those items and do nothing about it. Maybe they thought they have some super power to make those items disappear when they walked pass them. Are they not trained? But why the previous attendants did such a fantastic job and the current ones are not able to do them? High Staff Turnover I finally reaffirmed my view when I overheard an overseas guest complaining loudly to the hotel staff about the St Regis\u2019 falling standard recently. He said the hotel just couldn\u2019t get things right and everytime he complained, he will get a bottle of champagne as apology and things still not rectified. Apparently, he\u2019s a repeated guest (but I guess he will not be anymore). He continued to say that he\u2019s better off at another luxurious hotel just round the corner. I\u2019ve talked to some of the regular hotel guests, they too complained about the cost cutting measures and falling standard. If you ask me whether I still patronize the hotel, my answer is yes but only when it\u2019s really necessary. And I will definitely not recommend to my overseas guests. For now, it\u2019s just a rip off!", "Date": "September 6, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Pune, India", "Title": "\u201cmemorable stay in Singapore\u201d", "Author": "adityapune38", "ReviewID": "UR117683543", "Content": "The St Regis is easily the best hotel in Singapore.

Yan Ting - I had dim sum buffet lunch. The food was great. It was a bit hard to get the attention of the service stuff when I wanted to place my orders and some of my orders came very slow (the staff even thought all my food has been served).

We stayed at a suite on 30 Aug 2011, and the check-in time was supposed to be 2pm. We arrived at 2.40pm, to be checked-in by a surly front desk officer by the name of Katarine who told us that the room is not ready, and to return in 15-20mins time. We waited around the lobby, while she served the rest of the customers. We returned 20mins later, to be served by another front desk officer who again informed us to wait a little while longer. We had to return for the third time before we could be issued the access cards to our suite (1010). We went up to the suite, and the cleaning crew was still in the room. Upon seeing us, the cleaning crew left (which left us wondering if the room was really ready for our use). The butler service was equally patchy. When we checked into the hotel, we were issued a welcome letter from the guests relations manager (Fiona Zeng) that stated \"We have outlined the following Suite entitlements which you will be able to enjoy during stay with us... Daily cocktails and canapes served in-room or Astor Bar at 6-8pm\". Since we are travelling with a young child, we thought it might be inappropriate to bring the child to the Astor Bar. Hence we called the butler service at 730pm to request for the cocktail to be served in room. The butler said that he needed to check whether this request can be entertained and will get back to us. 10mins later, we called again, and the butler said this time round that due to safety (???) considerations, he would suggest that we proceed to Astor Bar to enjoy the cocktail and canapes, though he will check and let us know if it can be served in-room. I called the third time to check (a different butler answered this time round), only to be told with condescension that St Regis would \"make an exception this time round to serve the cocktail and canapes in-room\". I was aghast at the response. The guest was given a welcome letter with a choice. Apparently the option to choose became an exception which the hotel had to make for the guest on the grounds of safety concerns? If so, why offer such a choice to the guest then?

I would definitely not hesitate to say at the St Regis again. My ONLY complaint (and I hate to make it because it's an amazing hotel) is that the Internet appears to cost $10 an hour, a price which is really quite incredible when you consider that $50-a-night hotels offer speedy WIFI for free elsewhere in Singapore. Still, Starbucks and Chilis round the corner offer free WIFI (Chilis is best as it's faster and runs its own network) and you shouldn't waste your time on the net here anyway, not when you could be up in the spa experience the wet room which is free to all guests.

We had booked two adjacent bedrooms but only one was ready. With hindsight, I should have made a fuss there and then and I deeply regret not to have done it.

Then we went out for dinner. When we came back, we were told that the adjacent room was defective (a leak apparently) and we needed to move to a different set of bedrooms. The hotel staff were just looking at us packing our stuff in a hurry and didn't lift a finger to help. I would have appreciated them to move my things but it simply didn't cross their mind. I made my discontent known and from that moment on we kept receiving apology letters (from the receptionist, from the manager -who wanted to meet us and was calling us every 5 minutes -for god's sake we are on holidays,...). The bedrooms were fantastic (I especially liked the power shower) but you need to pay a hefty amount for wi-fi. It was unclear whether the breakfast was included (it was, in the end). When we checked out, they removed a little bit of our bill but it won't make me come back. On a more positive side, I highly recommend the Italian restaurant next to the swimming pool.

Some of the other St. Regis hotels are just branded \"St. Regis\" but do not live up the level of service and quality that is supposed to come with the brand (like the one in Beijing. It's awful. Don't stay there). Everything about THIS hotel, however, lives up the St. Regis brand - from the decor, the amenities, to service and even the toiletries (they use Remede products) and the famous Red Snapper cocktail. Pros: - Super location. Right around the corner from Orchard Road. - Impecable service. - Luxe rooms with terrific amenities. Fluffy beds, thick towels, great sized bathroom with 2 sinks, seperate shower and soak tub (with TV). - The rooms are set up well for people who need to do work. Built in coverter plugs, large desk, etc. Cons: - Room service food is so-so. - Room rate is absolutely absurd now if you do not have a corporate rate - S$620 when I stayed! I stayed here when it first opened 3 years ago and it was only ~S$200 then. - They're getting cheap on the products. No lotion in the room this time and they used to provide the Remede body gel in both the shower and the tub but now just in the shower. - They charge for internet access. I know lots of hotels do this but it's annoying when you are already paying a high room rate. - The gym is just okay. Small-ish and not a ton of equipment, though all of it is very new and it is very clean. Tips: - This is one of the best values for your Starwood points - only 12,000 points to stay here!! - Take all the Remede products in your room with you.

The executive rooms are longer in shape than the grand deluxe and look over the pool. The Grand Deluxe Room The hand painted wallpaper accents in the Grand deluxe rooms and the view of the botanical gardens are what makes these rooms that little bit more special. They have gloss wooden doors and accents, the bathrooms are beautiful with in wall tv's above the free standing claw foot baths and fabulous amenities.

They will offer you fresh tea or fresh made coffee in the morning at any time delivered to your room,a real treat to wake up to and a hand delivered newspaper. Over all I rate this hotel 6 stars as it truly is an experience.

Once outside the driver took our bags, opened the doors for us and within minutes of landing we were reclining into the sumptuous leather of the Bentley. Arriving at the St. Regis the service didn't let up. The moment we stepped out of the Bentley we were greeted by a staff member who took us straight up to our room and did an in room check-in. Our bags arrived shortly after and then the butler knocked on our door offering tea and coffee. The room was spacious with all the amenities one would expect but the real stand out was the bathroom. With fixtures and fittings reminiscent of a 16th Century French palace, it included two sinks, a bathtub with TV and a shower with multi-directional jets. The toiletries provided were also of the finest quality. What we liked... Service: Impeccable.

The staff were more than happy to remove the charge once we explained the above. Having later checked our reservation we realised that breakfast had not in fact been part of our booking. Butler: The butler service was a fantastic extra and we ordered many cups of tea, coffee and hot chocolate. Quality: All aspects of the hotel are of the highest standard. Location: Being at the end of the shopping madness that is Orchard Road and close to the Botanical Gardens this was an ideal location for exploring Singapore. Transfer: The Bentley transfer upon arrival is well worth it. We liked it so much that we booked it on the way back as well. What we didn\u2019t like...

Wifi, non-alcoholic drinks at the mini-bar, pay-movies etc were all thrown in with the suite which resides at the corner of the hotel floor.The windows of the lounge/sitting area open up to a great view of Tudor Court, and the Tanglin area, which was much better than the executive deluxe rooms facing the back of the hotel in my previous stays. I love St Regis for its highly comfy and classy settings/furnishings, where sleep quality is ensured with the nicely-sized King size bed, soft and comfortable bedding. I have no problems settling in each time, and this is coming from one who usually takes a while to get comfortable with hotel beds and getting a good night's sleep. Due to the partiioning, the bathroom area appears less spacious as it does not quite open up to a good space unlike experiences in the executive deluxe room. I love the double basin concept (no need to share and re-organise the toiletry space with your partner!), though the window of the bathroom at the tub area looking into the bedroom did not quite give the intended effect. I would rather opt for the rain shower, which has good jet power and relaxing feel. I was disappointed however for the fact that complimentary cocktails/canapes were served in the Drawing Room, which did not give a sense of distinction and serenity, as it was on the ground floor. Likewise, I would rather have the hotel extending an offer to serve breakfast/cocktails at the comfort of the suite for those who desire a quieter respite over the weekend. Altogether the hotel is worthy of its status, and I like the slightly quieter location just at the border of Orchard Road area to escape from the buzz of town, yet it is a short hop away from your needed (retail) therapy and other indulgences. Luxurious comfort can be tagged with the hotel name, though there should be finer touches to make guests feel more welcomed and recognised. It also seems that the hotel suffers slightly from a high volume of residents, which can be seen from crowds during breakfast time. (By the way, Sunday breakfasts are served at Brasserie Les Saveurs till 10am only, so those who wish for a lie-in on Sundays should opt for La Brezza on Level 2 which serves breakfast till 11am.)

We have also stayed in the Grand Hyatt, Fullerton, Four Seasons, Conrad and Ritz Carlton in Singapore. Checked in for just a short stay as a get away. Aside from the usual posh lobby, well appointed rooms (kudos for keeping the furnishings in mint condition still) and great breakfast buffet expected of a top 5 star hotel, we also enjoyed attentive check-in (he proactively offered us a higher-floor to give us a better view), generous waiver of our child's breakfast buffet, and friendly valet services (they even went and got the car for us just to retrieve something we had left in it...and we only found out later that the car park is easily accessible from the lobby and we could've easily retrieved the item ourselves). Unfortunately, our stay was marred a little by the following, which I feel was highly unacceptable for a 5 to 6 star rated hotel and a brand name like the St Regis: 1) Poor and late housekeeping- First, when we got to the room, the toilet smelled like someone had just used it...it smelt really bad. Then, we found stains on the hand towel. We called for turn down service at about 6PM, went for dinner, and returned to find that nothing had been done. We had to call about 3x before Housekeeping appeared, by which time my child was tucked into bed and we had to simply ask for fresh towels and emptying of the trash. We requested a child's bathrobe, which didn't appear, and had to request it again the next day, only to receive it one hour before check-out. In the morning, we activated the Make Up Room light, left the room for almost 3 hours, and returned to find nothing had been done. (It is actually interesting, we wanted so much to love the hotel we held our breath when we opened the door...). Housekeeping then showed up close to noon, when we were watching an in-house video-movie, and we almost thought about forfeiting the movie just to let him clean in case he didn't return....He did eventually return, after we activated the button when the movie was done, had no service for another hour or so, then called again. By then, even though we needed to use the room, we decided to simply huddle on the sofa and let Housekeeping do his cleaning because it was Now or Never. 2) Poor pool-side experience The pool was small, which was OK with us, since it was beautiful and clean. However, there was ZERO pool-side service- no one at the towel stand, no water offered, nothing. The deck chairs were grubby. Given that this was a very small area, it was not acceptable that people were allowed to smoke close to the pool area as we all had to put up with the second hand smoking. In fact, 2 of these smokers were hotel staff girls, huddling in a corner by the trash can! 3) Erratic Room Service Room service took almost an hour to whip up 3 simple dishes the first evening, and ice water was served instead of warm as requested (a minor infraction perhaps)... But after that, the butler with a second pot of tea and the table clearing took an inestimably long time to arrive. The meal we ordered the next day appeared more promptly, but this might be because we were so hungry we decided to speed things up by ordering only 1 dish. 4) Too Soft Mattresses This might be a matter of personal preference, but I could not sleep a wink as the mattress sagged and provided no support. For a 3 or 4 year hotel, I want to say that this was because they had deliberated chosen a soft mattress, but this mattress problem was not my experience in my previous stay (or I would not have returned). For a short stay, we overall had a good time, but a long term guest might want to re-consider his options as these inconveniences could build up quite a bit of frustration over time.", "Date": "May 21, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia", "Title": "\u201cVery much pleased\u201d", "Author": "Shahhfield", "ReviewID": "UR107890527", "Content": "I was really pleased with this hotel during the time staying here.

After a 13 hour flight from London, I decided to treat myself to the St Regis Bentley transfer, so I arrived at the hotel in supreme comfort. This transfer might cost many multiples of a taxi transfer, but to step off of a long flight, be escorted off of the plane to a completely separate area by electric buggy, and then be told that one\u2019s luggage is waiting for them in the car outside, it is (relatively) priceless. Check-in (both times around, and I only had the Bentley transfer for my first stay) was smooth, and very painless \u2013 certainly no queues as others have noted. One thing I will say about some of the check-in staff is that their English, and general friendliness is not on a par with the standards in virtually every other area of the property. This is probably the weakest area of the hotel, front desk staff should all be extremely friendly and absolutely fluent in English (and other major languages). I experienced two grades of room, the Grand Deluxe, and Lady Astor. Whilst the Lady Astor grade has a slightly larger bathroom with a window, the room has smaller windows and overlooks the city, and not an especially good view of the city either, the Grand Deluxe definitely has an airier, lighter feel and enjoys views over the greenery of the Botanical Gardens. The lighting panel is not complex as others have implied, far from it, one button to switch off all the lights and a few \u201cmood\u201d settings, that\u2019s it. The Bose sound system and large television complete the overall high quality feel of the room. Dimensions are generous, and decor is very attractive, with white wooden panelling, lots of marble, Murano glass chandeliers, and rich fabrics and textiles. On general maintenance, the Lady Astor room had a tear to the sheer curtain \u2013 something which should have been replaced almost immediately in an hotel of this calibre; very disappointing that no remedial work had been carried out. The TWG tea service \u2013 for me \u2013 made the butler service special; it was very pleasant to receive one\u2019s chosen tea after a morning alarm call. The TWG tea is a really lovely touch and is served in TWG\u2019s own brand teapots which are very stylish; far easier to call down for a drink than to start messing around with making it oneself. I never had to wait more than ten minutes (and often it was far faster) for a cup of tea to be brought to my room. The garment pressing service was speedy, and perfectly executed. Whilst not essential, butler service to all rooms certainly differentiates this property from others in the city. The concierge were very helpful (and patient!) in making restaurant reservations, and sorting out flights for me. The service throughout this property is of such an high standard, that when I walked up to a concierge who I had never dealt with previously, he knew my name \u2013 I am still unsure as to how he managed this trick, and even though they wear earpieces, the person at the other end still had to have known my name! However, I do note that it was impossible to call the concierge directly from one\u2019s room, the phone always rang and rang and ended up being diverted to the central guest services number who would take a message to relay to the concierge. Whilst not ideal, the concierge did always return my call in a very short space of time. The doormen deserve a special mention for being so friendly, courteous, and also real characters who would share amusing anecdotes with you. The outdoor pool is a very pleasant \u2013 and largely underused \u2013 area; service is a little minimal, cold waters are brought over to you every so often, but there should be a sorbet/iced fruit service as this level of property too. The spa is delightful, and comprises a small indoor wet area with heated marble slabs, Jacuzzi, sauna, and steam room and an even smaller outdoor Jacuzzi area. One thing I will point out is that the spa areas are entirely separate for men and women which is absolutely fine, but it would have been nice for there to be a communal area where one can spend time with one\u2019s partner. As with the rest of the hotel, the spa staff are superb. The breakfast is fantastic, and standards were consistent throughout my stays; I am genuinely puzzled as to how anyone can complain about this. There is an excellent selection of fruit, including fresh berries, a wide range of high quality cereals, and granola. All the usual cold cuts, about half a dozen European cheeses (something which needs to be taken in context i.e. the hotel is in the middle of Asia), American hot selection (quite why anyone would want a \u201cfull English/American\u201d when there are so many other more interesting options baffles me, but the choice is there nevertheless), Oriental hot selection, Indian hot selection, made to order omelettes, selection of breads, and really good quality French style pastries. If the buffet selection is still not enough, there is an a la carte available with classics such as eggs Benedict, French toast, and waffles. Service is perfect; napkins were neatly folded each time one left the table to go to the buffet, glasses of fresh orange juice were continuously topped up, and the staff even replaced my tea with a fresh one so that I wouldn\u2019t be drinking lukewarm liquid. The breakfast really sets one up for the day in a very positive frame of mind! The Italian restaurant was probably my least favourite, whilst the service was good, the food was just a little ordinary. The pizzas were fine, but they were certainly not one of the best pizzas I have ever had, and for the prices charged, and the fact that the rest of the property really excels, the food just needs to be a little more special. Decor is pleasant though, and one could \u2013 with a bit of imagination \u2013 be sat by an hotel pool in Capri. The complimentary wine presentation each evening is a very thoughtful touch; only a few guests took advantage of this, so it was never crowded. It comprised a flight of three wines and a selection of cheddar and biscuits to accompany it. I hadn\u2019t intended having dinner in the Brasserie Les Saveurs (the menu seemed a little conventional compared to some of the cities other French restaurants), but circumstances resulted in my dining there, and I could not have had a more enjoyable dinner. Whilst all the tables could be described as comfortable, I was seated at an alcove (although it is so large and private it could almost be described as a room) which was especially pleasant. The level of service was ultra-attentive yet unobtrusive, throughout my two hours it was absolutely faultless. The waiter took note of our dietary requirements and the amuse bouches were tailored accordingly \u2013 again, a thoughtful touch. The food itself was superb, and married contemporary and classical techniques resulting in dishes that really were a triumph \u2013 they were not too traditional to be dull, nor too avant garde to become challenging. One must have the flamb\u00e9ed mango for pudding, it is done tableside, and is a really exotic tasting dish. Neither my partner nor myself had coffee, yet we were still offered petit fours. We dined there on an early weekday evening, and the restaurant was very quiet, it is a shame more people do not discover what fabulous food is on offer. I would love to find a restaurant that offers this style of food and service (although I can\u2019t imagine anywhere in Europe offering such high standards yet being so relaxed and unstarchy) in London. Even if you may not ordinarily consider an hotel restaurant, this is an exception that you must make. During my stay I had one issue \u2013 which was largely out of the hotel\u2019s control \u2013 and this was dealt with, with the utmost professionalism and discretion. Things do go wrong \u2013 even in seemingly perfect properties such as this \u2013 but if handled correctly they become a non-issue. The Platinum level reviewer seems to be largely whinging about not being offered something for nothing simply by having a platinum level SPG status (which is not actually that difficult to come by). Now, whenever I am in Singapore I will not consider staying at another property as my experience of this one has been virtually perfect. The location is also a pleasure, away from the more commercial areas (Boat & Clarke Quay, Marine Bay), near to the shops, trendy (and excellent) Dempsey Rd. Restaurants, and close to the greenest parts of the city. Quite why the St Regis is not leading the various CN Gold and other lists for Singapore hotels is a mystery as the other leading hotels seem so ordinary by comparison!", "Date": "May 11, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Scotland", "Title": "\u201cGood hotel but some limitations\u201d", "Author": "ellysian", "ReviewID": "UR107764157", "Content": "We stayed at St Regis for a week and got to know the hotel well.

I really had no fault with the room at all. The service here was impeccable, as is the standard in Singapore.

Despite the fact that I was not buying any spa services, I was given a warm welcome, helped with my bags, etc. Very good service all around. The only slight downside to the hotel in my opinion is the somewhat out of the way location if commuting to the city center. It's very convenient for shopping and there's lots of good restaurants around, but about a 10-minute walk to the MRT. Maybe I'm a bit strange compared to most St. Regis guests in that I prefer to ride the MRT than take taxis, but the problem is that it's difficult to find taxis at rush hour in Singapore. In fact, one morning there were about 12 people waiting in line for taxis. That said, this is a minor inconvenience compared with all that's in the area.

The rooms are furnished to St Regis's usual high standard of quality, comfort and taste. But the place trips up on so many small points which a 5-star shouldn't. - The lighting system is far too complex, which you really don't need when you're stumbling around a strange room at night. The so-called reading light is a direct down-lighter from the ceiling, so you have to read sitting up in bed (many hotels of this standard give you an adjustable lamp). - The TV and sound system didn't quite work together, even after a repairman came round. We never managed to get surround sound for the TV, and there a weird vestigial trailing-off of sound after the TV was switched off. - The water pressure in the shower was poor, a problem I've never encountered elsewhere in Singapore. - When I booked in advance, I was asked to select a type of pillow and any treats I would like in my room. I chose foam pillows - I got down pillows. I requested some local fruit - I got two Granny Smith apples and a Chinese pear (perhaps these really were grown in Singapore). Like the earlier reviewer, I found the staff very willing to help but rather uncertain and in need of more training.

The staff seem to lack leadership, and whilst they try hard,they do not deliver the service and standards of a 5 star hotel. This can only be put down as lack of direction and training.

Response was friendly and courteous, almost too real for Singapore style. \"certainly sir. thank you!\" Room was spacious, with DVD player and Bose system. Bathroom was marble top to toe with TV enjoyment and a standalone bathtub, not always seen in most major hotel chains. Toiletries were from the Remede Spa which are excellent. Can't get enough of smelling good that day. There is also a wine tasting session at 5.30 to 6.30 every evening for guests with cheese assortment and grapes to go along with. Definitely a must go! Oh, did I also say that a complimentary birthday cake was given to me that came together with my tea. And my butler even apologized for sending the tea late because she was preparing my cake. Just too courteous. Breakfast was great too as there is none the usual busy breakfast crowd. Service was attentive and definitely an enjoyable one especially on a Sunday morning.

The Location - the hotel is situated a block away from Orchard Road. This puts you in the middle of the famous upscale shopping district and also a 10 minute walk to the MRT station which can take you anywhere on the island. This is a very nice area with plenty of posh dining and shopping options as well as hawker stalls for those who want to get a more \"authentic\" experience. The Room - we broke up our trip in southeast asia and ended up with two seperate stays at the St. Regis. The first was in a Grand Deluxe room which was spectacular. The second was in an Executive Deluxe room which was also great, but a little smaller. Both had great bathrooms with seperate shower and soaking tubs. The bathroom also has a television, so you can keep watching while you soak in the tub. The other great amenity was the power outlets are universal and can accomodate any type of power input. Either room would be great for a couple. The Service - As advertized, the St. Regis service is over-the-top great. Not only does the staff take care of any request and the butler service is there 24/7 if you need anything, but they are very friendly - something that we found you don't always get at other places. The Extras - Wine tasting, drinks & canapes, breakfast, and spa access were our favorites. Every morning the staff puts out a huge buffet-style breakfast with a mix of both western and asian foods. There is a chef there to prepare eggs or waffles and almost anything you could imagine or desire is available. It is a great way to start the day. After a long day of exploring we would come back to the hotel in time for the 5:30 wine tasting. The hotel has an amazing wine-cellar and tasting room and the somilier serves up some of his favorites each day. With finger foods and wine insights, it is a great way to start the evening. After that we liked to head over to La Brezza (one of the hotel restaraunts) for a complimentary drinks and canapes. The hotel offers any drink on the menu and the chef prepares a different light-snack each day. It is the perfect, relaxing way to start off the evening. The last point to note is the hotel spa - it is a beautiful facility with both free access to the wet lounge and pay-for services (as desired). We didn't get massages here, but did find the wet lounge a great way to relax after a long day of walking the city. The only \"negative\" comment about the hotel is that because of its popularity and status there were a lot of private events taking place in the hotel lobby and bar (wedding receptions, christmas parties, etc.). It doesn't keep you awake at night or disrupt services, but it was a little awkward at times to try and squeeze through the lobby in the middle of an elegant event.

A fantastic selection of hot and cold and in a very pretty restaurant \u2022 Staff - all round great. We found them to be very friendly with excellent english. In particular the doormen and the concierge went above and beyond for us \u2022 Location - excellent. The hotel is literally located around the corner from the top of Orchard The only small complaint I have is the room service I ordered late one night. It was an in-house burger and it was probably the worst I have had. It was tasteless (it seemed like just meat with no seasoning) and very little salad which was presented on the side - quite odd. But this is such a minor issue. All up, highly recommended and will definately go back!", "Date": "December 2, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Mumbai, India", "Title": "\u201cFabulous Pampering and Luxury\u201d", "Author": "gunjan67", "ReviewID": "UR88606732", "Content": "The St.Regis is located fantastically close to Orchard Road and offers the ultimate standards of luxury and pampering.

This wasn't garden-variety complaining - it was a well-traveled guest lending serious feedback on the most basic aspects of hotel service. With so many other fabulous hotels to choose from in Singapore, and with the St. Regis holding itself out as something above and beyond, they really need to step it up.

The difference hits you when you enter the lobby via the main entrance, greeted by a few chorus of \u2018good afternoon\u2019s. The check-in counters are not typical \u2013 it\u2019s a few sit down counters for one-to-one service instead of standing front desks. Check in was quick and efficient; we were also escorted to the lift which I felt was a nice touch. I appreciated the complimentary upgrade to a Lady Astor room too. The distinction with St Regis is its butler service. Coffee and tea are ordered with the butler and they bring it to your room. There are almost 10 choices of tea, along with coffee, cappuccino, hot chocolate, as well as an extensive pillow menu to pick from, although the bed itself comes with plenty of them already. The Lady Astor room itself is big \u2013 56sqm: 2 oversized single beds, a huge bathroom with a bathtub, 2 separate sinks, a makeup table, a shower, and a toilet. Plus a C-shaped couch and a coffee table. Cleanliness is excellent; nothing to fault. Some of the spa facilities are complimentary for in-house guests: steam chambers, Jacuzzi, hydro massage pool, and sauna (non in-house guests have to pay SGD85 to use them) \u2013 they were all quite good. The variety at breakfast was not as extensive as I thought, and quality honestly was just average for me. There\u2019s also a complimentary daily wine appreciation for all in-house guests from 5:30pm \u2013 6:30pm at the Decanter on level 1, which was a unique touch. There was indeed a difference throughout my stay because its St Regis \u2013 there were more smiley faces and plenty of good mornings and afternoons. We felt more looked after and very welcomed anywhere in the hotel. But as with all things, there are things to be improved: 1. Butler service \u2013 when we checked in, we were told that the butler will be at the room soon, so we waited. After half an hour, we called and the operator sounded a bit confused and asked what we need the butler for. We were in fact waiting for the butler to start our stay by telling us what his / her services are! The butler services was listed in a book set on the table, but I thought what they should have done is to get the butler to inform the guests what is available upon check in; otherwise the people who missed the book will not know that there is complimentary pressing of items upon arrival etc. There were also 2 occasions where 2 different butlers came into the room without pressing the doorbell \u2013 they probably used the master key and entered while we were still in the room. It is unacceptable, especially so for St Regis \u2013 it is only basic courtesy to ring the doorbell when entering an occupied room. Admittedly they were delivering tea etc on the 2 occassions but if their hands were fully occupied, what they should have done is to place the tray on the floor to free their hands for pressing the doorbell. It would have been a disaster if we were in the middle of changing our clothes or worse, a couple engaging in some acts of affection. 2. Turn down service \u2013 the 1st night I was there, a lady rang my doorbell and tried to explain in English what she was there for - the turn down service. But she couldn\u2019t, and eventually had to explain in Mandarin instead which I understood. But I thought the staff should be trained to at least be able to inform in English the purpose of them appearing at the door \u2013 what happened if it was a hotel guest who could not understand Mandarin (and given the clientele of the hotel; very likely). The turn down service also included a bar of chocolates \u2013 nice touch. 3. Breakfast \u2013 during one of my 2 breakfasts, I encountered a very strange aftertaste in my orange juice \u2013 suspiciously like soap. I alerted one of the staff who nodded her head and took it back into the kitchen, but the issue was never addressed thereafter. 4. Spa garden \u2013 The spa garden is a outdoor Jacuzzi in the spa which I tried for both days \u2013 but on the 2nd day, the water looked obviously more murky than previously, which made me wonder if the water needs to be changed / cleaned more frequently. Outside of the above issues, my staycation was excellent.

(Even the ones in Singapore which are generally excellent.) I stayed at the St Regis Singapore for a week at the end of August. I was impressed from the minute I walked in to the minute I left. Their service was amazing. I also had customers I was hosting throughout the week which stayed and also commented how great the hotel was. When I arrived on a late flight I was checked in and then shown around my room. Whilst I thought at the time it wasn't necessary, I soon realised I would not have worked out how to work all the hidden features in the room.

Like some others have mentioned, they remembered which juice I like and how I like my coffee and they greeted me each morning. The rooms were fantastic and very comfortable. I was most impressed by the butler leaving me a personal note when I went out to dinner one night, to see if I would like a cup of tea when I came home. Then another night I had rung up to check how to use the internet, but I had gone out before I used it. I came back to a handwritten note of instructions placed on my PC to show me how to connect. Some might argue this was intrusive but they were always discreet and always surprised me with the service level. Another example is that you get 3 items ironed for free when you check in. But I rang to get an iron to press some other clothes (late at night). They didnt have one available as it was late but they came straight away and collected the ironing and offered to do it for me. They even asked which piece I wanted to wear the next day and what time I needed it to get dressed. (by 7am and I asked at 11:30pm) Wow. Oh and the gym was quite good also, not huge but adequate. Nice cool aircon and lots of cold bottled water. The only time I had trouble was when checking out. I had 6 accounts to pay and it was a little time consuming to sort it out but that is to be expected with so many bills.

We spent two nights here on our way home to Australia after being overseas for almost nine weeks. We had booked a Lady Astore Suite and alerted the hotel that our flight got in from LA at approximatley 5.45am. Whilst we did not expect to have our room ready we certainly did not expect the service we received. We actually arrived earlier at 5.30am and our bags were brought in and we where checked in by Mr Timmy Tao (Assistant Manager) who advised that as our suite was not ready the hotel had put a smaller room aside for us to use that morning to have a sleep and freshen up in and when we had woken up they would transfer our bags to our suite later in the day. We had also asked if possible for a late check out ont he day we were to depart as our flight did not depart until 9.00 pm. This was also accomodated and in fact when we got back into the room that afternoon to shower and change before leaving for the airport, housekeeping had been in and done the room, even thought we were checking out (we had had late checkouts in other hotels before, mostly Sofitels but in all cases Housekeeping had not done the room - another luxury touch - but to be honest I had had a bet with my husband that the service at the hotel was so exceptional that I would not have been suprised to find that housekeeping would have been in). But back to our check in. Mr Tao personally escorted us up to a lovely room and showed us all features (this room was impressive in itself and we thought wow if this is what we get for a smaller room just to use for a few hours - the suite must be very impressive. Within half an hour of arriving at the hotel we had checked in and were in bed. A few hours later our wake up call came quickly followed by tea and newspapers served by the Butler. We then showered and changed and headed out to Singapore refreshed and recharged by a few additional hours sleep. This was wonderful. Upon arriving back at the hotel at 5.00pm that afternoon we collected the keys to our Suite and found our bags had been moved and we settled in. The Suite was a corner suite and had its separate entry, separate lounge, large plasma TV, separate bathroom and toilet, with sliding doors into the entry and then into the main bathroo and then out the other side into the large walk in robe and then another lsiding door inthe the large main bedroom, with another large plasma screen. The bathroom was incredible, huge free standing tub with a small plasma screen at the end, a massive shower that was warm when you entered (full size heated mirror on one of the walls in the shower), Double sinks and huge fluffy towels, robes, slippers and wonderful bath products. Yes the light switches and blind switches were a little confusing and hard to operate as other trip advisers have started and by the time we were ready to leave we had figured them out. The butler service was a little slow, again commented on by other reviewers but I think there was only one per floor so we were not overly concerned. Free water and chocolates at turndown, free tea and coffee from the Butler service 24/7, free newspapers to your room and a lovely little tray of fresh fruit each day delivered to your room. All lovely touches. A special highlight was the wonderful Concerge Eric - We had been told how good he was by a business associate and they were right. We introduced ourselves with a note from our business associate who stays at the hotel frequently and nothing was an issue for him, He gave us some valuable tips for restaurants and lots of other dos and donts, he was also honest with us when we asked about certain things we had been told were worth doing, based on what we told him our style and preferences were he made alternative suggestions to things he felt were probalby more suited to our lifestyle. Also would like to compliment the staff each morning at Breakfast (which was included in our suite rate). Leila in particulary, the second morning at breakfast she greeted us by name and then asked if we wanted our juices (remembered that I liked half orange and half grapefruit) and also remembered that we liked our coffee and tea at the end of the meal not at the start without being reminded. She also remembered that I liked hot milk in a jug beside my coffee. Also asked me if I wanted Eggs Benedict again - This was very impressive for her to remember this and certainly made us feel very special. The food was well presented and the buffet selection more than satisfactory then you could have our eggs etc cooked to order. We also ate in the main restaurant one night, expensive ($31.00Singapore for the lobster bisque - but well worth it). The restaurant has a wonderful feel and is very impressive in its decor. The night we ate we were seated at a table two over from a family of four or five with three small children, we asked if we could move and it was no bother. Shortly after this the children at the table were quite noisy and in fact it was not pleasant, when one of them threw a major tantrum and ran through the restaurant. The staff came over to apologise and advised they would be moving the other guests down to the other end of the restaurant which was far removed from all the other guests. This was greatly appreciated as when you are eating in a fine dining restaurant at high prices the last thing you really want is other peoples badly behaved children spoiling your meal and its rare that a restaurant actually cares if other guests children are behaving badly. The staff overall are exceptional, prime example was we were in the business centre one day and June assisted us with the computer, for less then five minutes. The next day she was in the elevator with us and said \"Good Morning Mr & Mrs Dobson\" - amazing memory. Overall this was a wonderful hotel and an excellent introduction to Singapore, we are already planning to head back to Singapore for a long weekend to enjoy the hotel and shopping again. A nice touch upon check out was that there was a message from Mr Tao wishing us a safe trip home (he was not working that day), also Eric and one of the other staff members coming out to the front door and waving us off. This hotel is certainly now a favourite with us and based on this experience we will be keen to try other St Regis hotels throughout the world. In fact joined their loyalty club before we left.

Really nothing serious, especially when compared to the rest of the experience.

We travel to Spore at least 6 times in a year. Because of the SPG program, we chose to stay at St Regis as it's newer and more comfortable than the only other SPG hotel, The Sheraton. On our 1st stay in 2007, the main TV was faulty. On our 2nd stay, the room lights were faulty. At about 4am, the lights came on, shortly after, the curtains were automatically withdrawn. Then the lights came on again.... Imagine having to frantically search for the room lights and figure out the high tech control panel at 4am in the morning! On our next visit, the toilet TV was faulty! There was even a tattered hole in the bathe towel and rust stains on 1 pillowsheet! The following visit was diastrous. We checked in at 11.30PM, after a long and very tiring day, Lo and behold! Our door key couldnt work! A minute later, the bellhop arrives with our luggage. After an unsuccessfully attempt, he leaves and says he'll inform reception. After 10minutes, the bellhop returns alone but with a new set of key cards....again they dont work! He leaves us again and says he'll inform the butler as only the butler has a master key! After yet another 15mins, the butler FINALLY arrives! We were already standing outside our room door for almost half an hour! After offering his apologies, he informs us that the room door lock is faulty and the hotel security staff has to fix it. So at 12midnite, our door bell rings and the security staff 'fixes' our door. The next morning, I called the butler for a cup of coffee and hot chocolate. After 45mins later, still no drinks. I call the butler again and this time I was informed that the drinks were already 'served' and sent to room 2006. Problem was, MY room no was 2007! The butler then tells me that my call was reflected as a call made from 2006! Can you believe that!!!! ???? My last stay was in Dec 2009. As a Platinum cardmember, we were upgraded to a suite. We then had to extend our stay but were advised that we had to move to a normal room as 'all their suites' were fully booked. After having stayed in that room for 1 whole week, moving rooms was definitely not a welcome idea esp with all the additional xmas presents and lots of shopping. A check on their hotel website showed there were suite rooms available for booking! After pointing this out and making a verbal complaint, the htl manager finally relented and said we could keep our room. This was 2 days later! So that was it! My final straw with St Regis. All our subsequent stays were either at Sheraton Hotel, InterCon and most recently, we tried Grand Hyatt. Service at any of these hotels far far surpasses St Regis. The best service would be InterCon, where I found the staff very warm, friendly, cheerful and always ready to offer their service. After half a year later (ie today 30 June 2010), I eventually decided to give St Regis another chance. No suites upgrade this time, but only a level up to their Lady Astor room. Upon entering our room, we were greeted with nice 'welcome msgs', a fruit platter and a welcome note from our butler introducing herself and informing us to call her anytime for anything. I thought 'ok, so maybe their service has finally improved'. With 2 adults and 1 kid, we definitely needed more than 1 set of toilteries, shower gels esp. So hubby gives butler a call... no answer. 15mins later, he calls and again no answer. He needed to meet someone at the lobby so just before he came back, he informs the reception of our req for an additional set of toiletries. 1 hr later, nothing arrives. This time I tried my luck and call the butler, unfortunately, stil no answer! 15mins later I try again and this time I left a voice message and also asked for a bucket of ice. 30mins later, still NO call or service. I call the operator and enquired if the butler svc was 24hrs? 'Yes' was the reply...'Then how was it that we have not been able to reach the butler for the past 2hours???? And also, What ever happened to the add toiletries request we made thru the recep 1hour ago???? After apologising, he assures me the butler wil be sent to our room immediately. Within 5mins, our butler arrives, we thought, ok, so finally our toiletries and ice! NOoooooo.... he came only to get the ice bucket from our room! Imagine a 6star hotel not having a spare ice bucket??? TOTALLY RIDICULOUS!!!! At this point, I really didnt know whether to laugh or scream..... Conclusion? Beyond redemption! Bad service, TOTALLY no 'service recovery' or genuine attempts to 'win back their customer'. For the price you pay here, you'll be much much better off at the InterContinental hotel with better service, location, food (inside and outside hotel), shopping, convenience etc etc. Even the Grand Hyatt would be a much better option and cheaper too!

Normally the shampoo etc does not concern me but this brand was really lovley. The bath tub was great and had a TV screen and remote control so you cold lie in the bath and watch TV. The flat screen in the main area was huge and there was also a DVD system with lots of CD's. More could be obtained by calling the butler. Yes each floor has their own butler! The butler is very helpful and will arrange such things as reseravation, pressing of garments and serving tea. we asked for tea making facilities to be set up in our room and this was done. we found our body clocks a little out so when we were wide awake at 4 in the morning we decided it would be better to make our own tea rather than have the butler serve us. The amenities in the hotel are great SPA and swimming pools and lots of bars and resteraunts. We used the Astor Bar and the Italian resteraunt by the pool. The latter being great. The Astor Bar had the world cup on TV so it was not a quiet place to have a drink. Breakfast was very good and lots of choice. Unfortunatley the staff of which there were any did not leave us alone. The minute you put a fork down they were trying to clear up or they were asking you if they could do anything for you. The same happens when you walk in the front door - someone wants to carry your bag. This hotel is great if you like attention. I found it very wearing after a while. The hotel staff do not appear to understand the word privacy. E.g I decided to put the do not disturb on the door and have a bath. whilst I was in the bath the phone rang so I ignored it. when I had finsished my bath I noted the message lights on the phone plus there was a note under the door. It appeared the butler had forgotten to return a clean tea cup to the room and was frantic that we would not survive without it. It is not the butlers fault - the hotel trains them to be so efficient they are not sensitive to people needing space. I did not one of the supervisors chastising a staff member in the resteraunt for not folding a napkin properley and I felt this was really bad mangement practice. I don't need to see this when I am eating breakfast and I was surprised that this should happen.

Neither we tried the hotel restaurants, there are so many around! Service was was good, everyone was polite and courteous, but in some ways it was not on a par with the stellar one of our August stay in St. Regis Beijing.

Property \u2013 5 Stars \u2013 Opulent lobby and rooms. In the rooms: Floor to celing windows with niceview of the green area, high end condos and embassies etc. However, the bottom half of the windows have some white design spoiling the view and I wish they did not have that; Check-in \u2013 3 Stars \u2013 We checked-in at 5 PM on the 7th April. Check-in was okay (the lady who checked us in had an attitude that was not friendly). Walked us to the elevator but did not explain anything about the hotel or features. Contrast this to our other stays at HongKong, Sheraton Grande in Bangkok and Sheraton in Pattaya, they walk you to the room and explain the property and features of the room and facilities. Butler/Front desk \u2013 3 Stars. Decent overall. However, Capuccino and Cup of Milk was barely luke warm one morning when I requested for hot. They replaced it. The worse was the TV in the bathroom was not working and it took 3 calls to the Butler over 24 hours and one with Front desk manager before it was fixed. For each time, they would come and either switch it on or off without the remote working. There was hardly an apology from the Front desk manager when I said it has already taken 3 calls and 24 hours and it has not been fixed when (a) the problem should not have existed and (b) it should have been properly attended to after the 1st call Breakfast \u2013 5 stars \u2013 High quality and good service Concierge \u2013 5 Stars \u2013 Very polite and helpful Chinese restaurant for lunch (I think the name was Yan Ting) \u2013 5 Star - Good food and service. We had lunch twice here. Housekeeping \u2013 3 Stars \u2013 Fine overall but did not replenish toiletries even though they were more than half empty. Pool side \u2013 2 stars \u2013 Servers were busy chatting. I had to walk to them so I could order a drink. When she did bring my drink, she put it in a table which was quite far from the lounging chair (which is in a quarter feet of water in the pool) and could not be reached unless you got up and took a few steps. This was very inconvenient but may be they do this to avoid spillage in the pool. I have seen similar set-ups at other hotels but they generally put a table next to you for drink (and do not serve food). Also, they had cold towels but I was not offered one \u2013 I had to ask for one. Check out: 5 stars \u2013 Smooth, Polite and Courteous Overall, I think unless you are on expense account, you can get much better service for lower rates. Like you can see above, the service is not consistent between departments or individuals. Many times it is top-notch and at other times it is disappointing. For how much you pay, I think it ought to be top-notch each time.

The location is just around the corner from Orchard Road. It's close enough to walk to all the shopping and eats you could ever want!

The gym is medium sized and well appointed and faces the pool. The spa is great (& we're not normally spa people) and if you want one of the best deep-tissue/sports massages in the world, ask for George. He is truly amazing and very professional. The tea service is great with a nice menu of various types of tea. You can call and have it brought up to your room any time of day. The breakfast buffet is varied and all good, lots of different kinds of fresh fruits, and an omelet stand where you can customize your omelet to order. The service can be a bit uneven -- partly due to a problem you find everywhere in Singapore -- staff tend to move from job to job quite often. But when I say uneven, it varies from good to excellent.

Unfortunately, we were hugely disappointed. To start with at check in, while the staff was courteous, she didn't impress me as the confident type. She came across as a new hire junior person who just graduated from a hospitality school. I mentioned that my booking could be under two different last names (my married or maiden names). She said she couldn't find my reservations. After a panic attack, I found out that she was looking only for one name and not the other. She then took me to my room and said that the butler would show me the room's amenities. I waited for about half hour but the butler never came and I had to dash off to a meeting. While having a 24/7 butler seems like an intriquing idea that sets the hotel apart from all other luxurious hotels, at the end we didn't find the butler particularly useful. If anything, it actually became a nuisance. We ordered tea at night, and only tea came... no sugar, no cream. In the morning when we ordered coffee, again only coffee came... no sugar, no cream. Considering that sugar and cream were not made available in the room, the butler should have been better trained to serve the complete set. Probably we would have gotten better service by calling room service. To top it off, the coffee pot was badly chipped... and the lacquer on the milk-serving cup was already fading. You don\u2019t even expect that in a three-star establishment! When we needed some tape to pack some boxes, we specifically asked for packing tape and not masking tape. The butler came back to us with masking tape. When we told him that what we wanted was packing tape, he said the hotel didn\u2019t have any. We then called the concierge, who promptly gave us the correct packing tape. The concierge ended up being very helpful. They were also friendly and always smiling. We thought highly of the people at the concierge and the front door. The electronics in the room were also a bit screwy. When we turned on the TV in the bathroom, the TV in the bedroom got completely messed up. After a battle with the remote(s), we called the butler (again!) and found out we needed to reset the system by pulling out the power cable from one of the controllers in the cabinet. It was definitely not easily accessible, and once we pulled the power cable out we had a tough time inserting it back in because we couldn\u2019t see the back of the controller. We also found that the light system in the room was complicated and we never quite figured it out (maybe because we never got that butler to show us around?). It seems that the lights are set up by mood type: bright (for reading), cozy (for when watching TV), and sleep. We couldn\u2019t figure out how to setup the lights if one person wanted to sleep while the other one wanted to read. I must say though that the bed and the pillows were very comfortable and I slept well. I also couldn\u2019t connect to the wifi at the hotel. I went down to the business office and was informed that the wifi at the hotel is so fast that it is not really compatible with the blackberries. The person at the business office was nice enough to take the blackberry from my hand and navigated through it with the help of the hotel IT department to finally get the wifi to work. While many people may have their laptops with them, the blackberries are quite a common gadget now that I find it strange the hotel is using a wifi system that is not automatically blackberry compatible. We found it a little strange too that there was no mirror at all in the bedroom (maybe it\u2019s a feng shui thing?), but plenty of them in the luxurious bathroom, including the mirrored wall by the free standing bathtub and a full-length mirror inside the shower. The closet arrrangement in the bedroom seems awkward because there is not enough drawers/shelve space. If your main interest is Orchard Road, then this hotel is not too conveniently located as it is at the end of Orchard by the Tanglin Road.

Since we stayed over for the New Year's eve, we decided not to join the hassle at the Marina Bay for the fireworks show since we have kids with us.

Away from the shopping it is not too far if you do want to shop, but far away so you can have a chilled out time in Singapore. This is a POSH hotel from the moment you enter. The Bentley's parked out the front are a dead give away. From the moment you arrive you really feel like royalty. The lobby is grand, the check in homely with couches. The lift has a very cute bench in it which comes in handy when you have had a long day and want to rest while going up 14 floors. Rooms are modern glamour. Cream and walnut paneling, hand painted bed heads and a free standing tube welcome you in. Current society mags (which I LOVE) posh fruit (peaches!) and Harry Connick Junior playing on the cd player (VERY COOL!!!!) are some of my reasons why I always stay here when I'm in Singapore. Butlers come with the room and you can call on them whenever you want tea or coffee. I mean who likes making it themselves really? I only have 2 complaints. the lighting is rather random. it is really hard to just turn the light on as their are all these settings with different themes. In the middle of the night it can be a problem. 2nd complaint is the lack of a power socket next to a mirror. GIRLS need this for blow drying ones hair.

I was on Level 3 (which is the lowest level for rooms) and the view was of tree tops. In hindsight, I should have booked a standard room - not a deluxe. I understand that the standard roms are on the other side of the hotel with no view at all (and obviously cheaper). I used the dvd library a few times - some good classics and a change from the standard hotel tv menu. Also used the JetQuay service from the airport. Was picked up at the gate and taken by buggy to a special customs, seated in a lounge for a short wait while my suitcase was collected. Then straight into a car bound for the hotel. A great service (SGD295). If you stay here, make sure you go to the fish spa a few doors down from the hotel (towards Orchard Road).

Another five minutes takes you to the junction of Scott Road where Takashimaya, Shaw Centre, Ion and many other large monuments to consumerism reside. So, good location. The hotel is \"relatively\" inexpensive for a St. Regis - I saw a number of special deals - and certainly it wasn't full when we were there over Christmas. However, like other top end hotels in big cities, the restaurant, bar and room service are pricey: SGD$19 for an orange juice by the pool. There is a complimentary wine tasting each evening to which I brought a few guests. Wine being so costly in Singapore, it was a nice treat, but the wines I tasted on two nights were decidedly average. There is a pool which I enjoyed despite the water being on the cool side and the pool itself being located in a shadowy wind tunnel created by many tall buildings. The fitness room was modern, clean, good, uncrowded. You can request a Herald Tribune every morning - yes! - along with your Straits Times. The rooms are spacious enough to put an extra bed and the sheets, pillows and bathroom are fantastic. (There's pillow menu with 13, or is it 30, pillow choices). There's a flat screen TV with lots of channels (and one in the bathroom which constantly malfunctions), a DVD player, and also audio inputs for your iPod/iPhone which output your music on great speakers. Your butler can bring you a choice of DVDs from their library (though when we were there, most of the choices were already taken since you can request as many as you want) and he can also bring you complimentary tea or coffee twice a day - a habit I could really get into. My only complaint, which seemed to sort itself out over a few days, was the temperature control which kept our rooms too cold. We stayed in an Executive Deluxe Room (actually their lowest end room - don't you love hotel room nomenclature) and also a Lady Astor room (about the same as an Executive Deluxe but with pastel colours and more ladylike furnishings). Bottom line, you'll be happy and if you got a good rate or points deal, you'll be really happy.

We were especially impressed with the manager of the bar.

So she started digging in and guess what she found? BROKEN PIECES OF GLASS. Not just several pieces but many many tiny pieces. so we called the butler up and showed him the problem. The butler's response was a total letdown to a hotel that pride itself of its butler service. He just offered to bring us another pillow and left, acting as if there's no big deal with the broken glass. But we kept our cool. After a while i rang up butler service again. another butler came up and this time we complained about the broken glass pieces. Sensing that we were not happy he apologized and went out to fetch the housekeeping manager who can only manage to apologize too. They didn't even bother to try to explain how the hell the broken glass pieces got into the pillowcase and how the housekeeper totally missed it. That only means something! They never change the pillowcase even after the guest leave!!! YUCKS, this is 5 star hotel, my goodness!!! They scrimped and save on soap and water. ZERO hygiene level. On the same day we checked out. At the lobby we were greater by some manager who's quite senior, probably just under the general manager. This manager's apology didn't even sound sincere. they offered the 4 of us a free ride to the airport in a crammed mercedes. Come on, i could have paid sin $50 for a maxi cab that could provide us much more comfort given the no of people and the amount of luggages we had. Do they think they could appease us just like that after such a close encounter that my daughter had with the broken glass? I hate their mentality that they think they could fix everything just by offering a free little something. We are not cheap!!! We are nice people who decided not to pursue the matter, that's all.

Had a brilliant room on the 18th floor, very large with a huge comfortable bed full of pillows, high backed chair and stool, pillow strewn sofa, huge TV and a good sized desk, plus a huge range of well lit cupboard and drawer space. The fridge was a pain as it didn't have any room for our private purchases and the mini bar was prohibitively expensive, but then it is a 6 star hotel. It took us 2 days to work out the light system is it very comprehensive! The bathroom is marble and gorgeous. Lovely stand alone bath tub facing a mirrored wall with a TV inset. His n hers sinks, although a major draw back was there were no drawers to put your toiletries so everything has to fit onto the vanity top, odd for such a well thought out hotel room, designer must have been male! Great shower with extra jets and rainfall attachment. Toiletries are high end and everything is provided, right down to a loofah and dental floss. Good soft large towels and plenty of them. A nice touch is free use of CDs and DVDs and you can plug your iPod into their sound system. Housekeeping put a jazz CD on for us at turndown so we always returned to the room with dimmed lights and music and a little box of chocolates, really nice touch. Along with the papers delivered every morning in a little bag, and a pillow menu. Our room came with a Butler 24/7 which we used on a regular basis as there are no tea/coffee making facilities in the room. You call the butler service and pick from a menu of teas and coffees which are free. Nice touch, fantastic at first having your morning coffee from china cups on a tray, but as they delivered it by the cup only I think the butler thought he was in a revolving door to our room as we are avid coffee drinkers in the morning. Our last day the coffee being delivered was burnt, strong and tepid. The butler changed it twice but it didn't improve so we ended up making a run to the Starbucks just around the corner for a decent latte. It was the only time we felt the 6 star service let them down. We used room service which was quick, delicious and well presented. They bring a table in with a white tablecloth beautifully set up with an orchid, etc, and the hot food is underneath in a warming drawer so no cold breakfast! We had a drink in the bar beside the entrance, good service, champagne and macaroons were delightful. Didn't use any of the other restaurants as we were busy going out to local restaurants instead. I used the large outdoor pool one morning. I was the only person there and obviously provided amusement for the surrounding office buildings! The pool is cool and good for laps. I didn't use the spa as it was too expensive and never found the steam rooms so can't comment. The staff were excellent, from the greeters at the door who refuse to let you open a door yourself, to the check in receptionist who walked us up to our room at 2.30am and ordered coffee from the butler (thank you Fiona), to the concierge staff for whom nothing was too much. I would like to give a special mention to Ian Tan, Chief Concierge, who was amazing. He went the extra mile, not just the usual restaurant recommendations and bookings, but being an absolute gentleman and walking me to the Fish Spa down the road in the evening when I was on my own. A special person who makes the hotel a 6 star experience. If we ever get the chance, we will definitely stay at the St Regis again.

Immigration procedures took 30 seconds to complete and we were seated in an elegant lounge with drinks and snacks while our luggage was being retrieved . Within 25 minutes of landing, we were seated in the hotel's Bentley on our way to the hotel. As a Platinum SPG member, I was upgraded to a deluxe corner room and we enjoyed in room check-in. The room was extremly classy, elegant, luxuriously appointed (hand painted silk pannels, lacquered wood veneer lobby with an elegant wet bar, marble floors, the usual electronics gizmos, electric drapes, etc..). The bed was very comfortable and dressed in beautiful, luxurious high quality linen. But the highlights of the room, was the amazing bathroom, with its free standing bath tub, separate wet room, and separate WC. An avalanche of marble combined with wood and expensive lighting made for a unique experience. The heating was cleverly hidden behind the various mirrors gracing the bathroom. Obviously, high quality robes, fluffy towels and top toiletries were complementing the scene. We were introduced to one of the many butlers who looked after us during our stay. I have to say that they all have proved to be extremly efficient, courteous and always there. The longest we had to wait for them to appear was 7 minutes (and that was on a very busy day). Overall, the service across the hotel was impeccable, the employees extremly polite and helpful. The breakfast in Les Saveurs is a unique, high quality experience (as a Platinum SPG, it was offered to us for free throughout our stay). In comparison, I attended a business breakfast at the Fullerton during my stay and it did not compare at all with the spread laid out at the St Regis, the variety and quality of the food on offer is superb. Please note that at peak time, you will have to wait for a table, especially at week ends. The Astor bar is a great location for well mixed, fancy and classic cocktails or a glass of delicious champagne. We also used the Spa and the Pool during our stay and they both receive very high marks indeed. Although the hotel was full, the pool was a haven of privacy and peace and quiet every time we visited. During our stay in Singapore, we visited the Fullerton, Raffles and The Mandarin Oriental. There is absolutely no question that the St Regis is the ultimate luxury hotel in Singapore at the moment.

The lobby area already looks a little dated. I'm not sure about the designer choices. Perhaps they were going for old-style luxury but some of the carpeting and light choices makes it look dated even tho the hotel is only 2y old. The suite was great, one of the best I've stayed in. It was luxurious and with all the mod-cons even if the numerous lighting controls took the full three days to decipher. Bed was comfy. Butler service was friendly and efficient and nothing was too much hassle. We would have liked to have the option of making our own tea in the room but it was nice that we could get the butler to custom make a ginger honey lemon tea since I had a sore throat. You get two tea servings a day for free. My wife told me the massage (done by a guy in this instance) at the remede spa was great and the facilities looked good with rain shower room, wet and dry saunas, jacuzzi etc.. The gym and lap pool (at least 20m, maybe 25m) also looked very good altho I was not feeling well enough to try them out. It's about a 5-10min stroll to the start of the main Orchard Rd shops so the location is pretty good and there is a small mall with a supermarket 2min walk away in the opposite direction for anything small or urgent. The only negative thing I can say about the hotel is the breakfast and unfortunately it's a big negative. The food quality and selection was poor, even for a 3 star hotel, and the service was of a similar standard. It's as if they subcontracted out the breakfast room to a cheap third party caterer. Very few of the fruit on offer was ripe (mostly sour) and the hot foods area was almost inedible (scrambled eggs was like yellow soup one day, the sausages tasted like cardboard). I am not surprised about the previous reviewer saying the afternoon tea is poor if it's done by the same kitchen and staff. If breakfast was not included in my package I would have definitely eaten at the cafe in the mall which is quite popular with expat wives doing their grocery shopping. Despite this gripe, the hotel is now definitely high on my list of hotels to stay in Singapore as long as they keep offering these deals. I don't mind paying a bit of a premium over nearby 5 star hotels for what is a better hotel, in my opinion, but the normal rack rate is a bit much.

I sat down and it was immediately obvious that the champage flutes on the table were dirty - I picked mine up and saw both lip-stick marks and water stains. I asked the waiter to replace both glasses. We placed our order and asked for some iced water (which I could see was close-at-hand on the waiter's table). After maybe 5 minutes, none had been provided. The restaurant was starting to fill up and it became clear that there were just not enough staff on duty to provide attentive service. Eventually I had to walk over to the same waiter (head waiter?) and ask again for the water. We order the quiche and satay savouries. Maybe ten minutes later, quiche and dim sum arrived instead. That was sent back and next our requested quiche and satay appeared. Later in the meal another waiter appeared to bring us the quiche and satay which we had already been served. Later still, yet another waiter appeared with - you've guessed it! - the same dishes again. After the second of the four deliveries, the head waiter came over, apologised for the error with the first, and offered us a complimentary extra glass of champagne. We enjoyed most of the food, except for the rock-hard, stale scones and one sponge cake which must have been several days old. But absolutely nowhere was there any 6-star \"wow\" factor. Instead there was a bill of SGD 125 (about USD 90) for 2 people. I would have been happy to pay that steep price for afternoon tea if it truly was a 6-star, excellent food and wonderful service offering, but it very much was not. On the way out, we happened to be greeted by the hotel's general manager. I gave him our feedback which he accepted graciously. What surprised me, overall, is how a hotel of this notional 6-star rating can get away with disorganised, untrained and insufficient waiting staff; with food that is no more than good and in some cases awful; dirty furniture and filthy glasses; and sky-high prices?", "Date": "October 24, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "shivanip29", "Title": "\u201cProbably the best hotel I've ever stayed at\u201d", "Author": "shivanip29", "ReviewID": "UR46588515", "Content": "We booked using Starwood points, and were at the St Regis for part of our honeymoon.

The checkin was underpar, the reception was cold and not personable unlike at Pan Pacific where they engaged in a light banter with the guest to make you feel welcome while not intrusive. The room is beautiful, reminds me of the Mandarin Oriental or the Four Seasons. Can't argue with the size and facilities provided. Our butler's english wasn't up to standard as he kept tripping over his own words. After he left, we noticed a large piece of stepped on potato chip near the settee, which the housekeeping missed! 2nd day, they forgot about our fresh fruits also. On checkout, there was no 'have a good stay' formalities, just took our key cards and say no extra charge, not even a goodbye from the lady. Only bright side is this little hotel staff call Assam who greeted us on 2 occasions with a sincere welcoming smile on his face.

It's the most expensive hotel in Singapore today, I usually stay at the Millenia Ritz Carlton but I wanted to try St Regis just once since it's the first luxury hotel in Singapore in more than 10yrs. Stayed there 2 nights. Hotel is located in the Orchard Road area, a few steps from the Shangri-la, shops like Isetann, Wheelock Place w/ Borders, Zara, Hermes are just 5 minutes' walk. Check-in was smooth and quite solicitious. Didn't have to wait at all. Was introduced to my very own private butler (on call anytime 24hours although I never did call him), who takes about 10 minutes describing every nook & cranny of the room. He offered to unpack my bags, but I felt uncomfortable with that. It was a bit awkward since he was so insistent in doing something for me, so just gave him a dress to press (free!). Also awkward since I wasn't sure if I was supposed to tip him & how much so I ended up giving SGD10 since we were just standing there. The room is very comfortable. Glamorous old-style, opulent feel, but definitely has all the bells and whistles (Boss speakers, huge flat screen tv, different mood lighting, electronic curtain). Comfy bed, sheets of great quality. What I love most is that the sheets, comforter, bed cover and even carpet were very new/clean (I sometimes freak out when I see a tiny stain on the carpet or bedcover, enough to ruin my stay). Loved the bathroom, with the standalone bathtub in the middle and a 12\" flat screen tv in front of the tub. Ritz Carlton's bathrooms were supposedly the world's sexiest (bathtub by the big window overlooking the city/marina), but the St Regis bathrooms are better since they are newer and you just know they spent more money for it, despite lack of a view/window. There's a separate stall for shower, toilet, clothes, two sinks separated by the bathtub. A big plus- they have regular sized Remede products in the bathroom, not those generic hotel-issued ones. I loved these!! I thought that alone made the high rate worth it. Breakfast at the lobby lounge - size not too big, so the place feels more private/exclusive, overlooking the fountains. Breakfast selection was quite disappointing though for the price I was paying, just mostly cold cuts & cereal. Ala carte menu for breakfast also limited. Not impressed. I didn't try their Sunday brunch though, so that might be better as Sunday brunch is a big thing among the hotels in Singapore. Remede Spa - I think this is the first in Asia, massage expensive (as all 5-star hotels are) but just wanted to give it a try. It was ok but for the price I would go somewhere else. I usually stay at the Ritz, and I am so used to it (especially love the high, comfy bed w/ fantastic sheets, also the wooden floors in the bedroom since I hate carpeted rooms) and I miss the views, sleeping with the city lights below you and waking up with the view of the marina. But the Ritz is starting to show it's age in some parts of the room. Overall, I love the St Regis.

Overall, it was an excellent experience and one that means we will return to the St Regis instead of the Shangri-la Valley Wing (where we had stayed just prior to this stay at the St Regis). The rooms are easily the best in Singapore - although the decor appears a little quirky from the website photos, in real life, the combination works and you instantly get the feeling of luxury and warmth from the room. They are very generous in size, the quality of the fittings and bedding is exceptional and no expense has been spared in pulling it all together. The electronics (tv, lighting, drapes, telephone, broadband - wireless in room etc) are all cutting edge. Of these, the lights (smart wired - eg 'movie', 'reading' etc) are the least value add and take some getting used to. The telephone is a VOIP handset with lcd screen icons etc and so just getting room service is an adventure in touch screen technology in itself (I use these phones at work and so I had a head start, but still saw this as an example of how an effort to install the 'best' can be counter-productive). The tv (a 42 inch lcd) was very good, with a good selection of movies - the kids loved it. The room also had a built in surround sound Bose music system which was playing jazz when we arrived - a nice touch and was used by us more than we expected. The room comes with a butler service, which is quite helpful - especially when you come to iron a shirt - as there is no iron in the room - just make sure you plan ahead as a 40 minute wait for a shirt at busy times can impede the best laid plans... When we arrived, we asked for the room rate to build in breakfast - which cost us an extra $30 per room per day, but this was far preferable to paying for breakfast at the standard rate. As for the breakfast offering, this was probably the only let down. The fruit display was outstanding, the espresso coffees good (especially for Singapore), but the hot meals were relatively ordinary - my eggs benedict were lukewarm, hard in the middle and uninspiring. As there is only one restaurant available for breakfast, it can also be quite busy and a short wait in the Drawing Room is not unusual. This is where the St Regis can learn from the Shangri-la where breakfast at The Line cafe is extraordinarily good and very memorable. We also had in-room dining - I can highly recommend the curry and local food options. The butler was also very prompt in removing the dining trolley without fuss. We also used the gym daily - it has the latest Technogym equipment which must have cost a small fortune. The attendant was very friendly and attentive and the whole experience very very good. If you are a gym user, this an A experience. All in all, we would not hesitate to stay at the St Regis again. It cots us about 30% less than our recent stay at the Shangri-la Valley Wing and was more enjoyable (though the service at the Shangri-la is extraordinary).", "Date": "January 2, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "San Diego", "Title": "\u201cDreamy Retreat\u201d", "Author": "TouristSanDiego", "ReviewID": "UR22788830", "Content": "Amazing hotel.

Shortly after my disastrous stay in Mandarin Oriental Tokyo ( read my review ) and feeling totally unsatisfied, I cut short my Tokyo trip and return to Singapore. Then I decided to splurge one last time for my hard-earned vacation and book a suite at the brand new St Regis instead. Besides, the price of the suite in Singapore is not that much different from a hotel room in Tokyo anyway. Arriving Upon my booking I was told that the room rate includes airport transfer. I thought it will be the standard pick up after clearing customs and hop into the car kind of airport transfer. However, the St Regis managed to surprise me. Upon disembarkation from the plane, an airport staff was already on standby to pick me up at the airbridge. I was then whisked away in a buggy cart to the CIP terminal where I cleared immigration without queing. Even more impressive, my bags has already been collected by the airport staff and in my limo waiting for me. What an excellent first impression! Upon arriving at the hotel, the hotel manager and the head Butler was there waiting for me. I was immediately escorted to my suite to take care of the usual check-in formalities. Then the butler gave me an introduction to the room facilities and amenities and a \u201ccrash course\u201d on how to use the technology in this suite. Believe me, this is a must. It\u2019s the second most technologically advanced hotel room I have encountered ( after the Peninsula Tokyo ). The Room The suite ( called \u201cManhattan Suite\u201d ) measures about 90m2 and comes with separate living room and bedroom, and a full marble bathroom. The style is classical, but everything is very very luxurious. Every part of the suite is decorated and adorned in rich and luxurious material. Either top quality polished veneer blond or dark wood or refined silk wallpaper. Even the floor is made from top quality wood. Furniture are also all classical and with rich colorful patterns and more importantly, it\u2019s comfortable. I love the functional L-shape working desk. The bathroom used top of the line French Brenche de Benou marble with fittings from Hansgrohe. There is a free standing bathtub, dual sinks and the most complete shower cubicle I have encountered, including a powerful overhead rainforest shower, handshower and side massage shower jets. The bathroom is supplied with Remede Spa products from St Regis\u2019s own Spa. Room also comes with lots and lots of gadgets. Two Sharp Aquos LCD TV and Bose home theater sound system in both the living room and bedroom. Ipod connection. Touch-screen phones. An amazing ( and sometimes confusing ) range of lighting switches. Some nick pits ( and for the hotel management to read and improve ) :- For a suite, they should have incorporated a bigger bathtub, maybe a platform bath instead of the same tub that are used in their standard rooms. It\u2019s OK but if you are over 5\u2019 8\u201d, might have problem fitting in. The closet is not ideal. It\u2019s rather narrow and there are limited shelve space. They could have incorporated a laptop size safe. The lightings are confusing and take some time to figure out. There are 4 mood lighting settings and different switches on the bed panel and remote can activate different lights. Sometimes it seems the system got confused, turning on the bedroom light as well when I press the bathroom light. The pillows on the bed are quite heavy. I\u2019m sure I can request for lighter foam pillows if I wanted to. There is no easy way to connect the iPod in the bedroom to the sound system. I have to manually connect the cables to the sound system at the back panel. They should provide a iPod dock. Due to the hotel\u2019s location, it\u2019s facing Tanglin road and there is not much of a view at night. The view in the morning however is quite nice. But frankly, all the abovementioned are just really nit picks which hardly distract from the quality of the stay and I can hardly think of anymore. Long story short, it\u2019s an amazing suite room that\u2019s unabashedly and unapologetically opulent. Right up there with the very best I have seen. Despite the style not exactly to my taste ( I tends to prefer more contemporary design ), I was very happy with this charming suite nevertheless and feel totally relaxed in it. Everything is absolutely top class. In summary, this room is a showcase of luxury on overdrive. I would dare say this suite would even be fit for a king or a visiting head of state. Just see the photos with this review. Service As already mentioned above, the arriving and welcome given by the St Regis is excellent. Absolutely no complaints here. St Regis also distinguished itself as a hotel chain that still uses the Butler system. Note that St Regis butlers are not like butlers in other hotels who most of the time are just house keeping staff. The butler is like a personal assistant during your stay and can help with bringing beverages ( unlimited tea or coffee ), unpack your luggage, help with housekeeping task, delivery of laundry etc. And because he or she is a dedicated butler, so they all get to know the guest on first hand basis and the goal is to provide personalized service and anticpate guests needs. All service calls in the St Regis centred around the Butler so at most time, you only need to call upon the Butler. During my short stay, all my requests were attended promptly and professionally. I was generally impressed with my butlers though some are clearly better than others. Let\u2019s just say there are still room for \u201crefinement\u201d. Common Areas The St Regis has some of the nicest common areas found among all hotels. On entering the lobby for the first time, one cannot fail to notice the huge overhead chandelier that adorned the ceiling. The style as in the room are all classical but it\u2019s very tastefully done. The airy LaBrezza restaurant at the ground floor has a impressive soaring atrium. Conclusion This is a top of the line 5-star luxury hotel thru and thru and while I have not seen the other hotels, I can confidently say this is the top hotel in Singapore currently and more than measure up to the best in other Asian cities. It\u2019s gratifying to note that finally my home country Singapore has a hotel with enough class and quality to match the best in other cities, such as the Four Seasons in Hong Kong or the Peninsula in Tokyo. I do look forward to a future opportunity to return here again. And I\u2019m pleased to award it my top 5/5 ratings, a rating which I do not give out easily. But does it now become my #1 hotel? Not there yet, but time will tell on repeated visits if they can keep this high standard.", "Date": "October 3, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "LAKE MACQUARIE", "Title": "\u201cStylish Hospitality\u201d", "Author": "JUELLE", "ReviewID": "UR20495047", "Content": "Our recent stays at St Regis was delightful, the Hotel is a calming retreat from busy Singapore.

The service was impeccable. The receptionist not only walked us to our room after checking in but also walked us to the taxi after checking out. Since we had only 1 night in Singapore and we could not get to Bee Chang Hiang for pork jerky before the store closed at 10 PM, the concierge actually sent someone out to get us 200 g to taste.

Haven\u2019t stayed at this end of Orchard Road before, my favourites like Ngee Ann City are at the other end, but it was OK. Anyway, we arrived at the St Regis at 7.30am (after a red eye flight from Istanbul) and they apologised that the room wasn\u2019t yet ready!! It took, oh another ten minutes or more before they could escort us up\u2026 We were only here one night, it was just a transit stop to rest on the way home to Australia. Therefore many of the services available at the St Regis (like the butler service) were not really of much use to us, as we just wanted to catch up on some sleep. The room (Executive Deluxe) was blissfully comfortable for this purpose and we slept for quite a while then stirred ourselves to have a delicious brunch at our favourite Straits Kitchen at the Hyatt. Followed by a little retail therapy, so we didn\u2019t actually spend much time evaluating our room at the St Regis, since we were either sleeping \u2013 or not there. The beds, pillows were very comfortable; the curtains darkened the room effectively and were motorized; bathroom had a free-standing tub as well as a great shower and good quality toiletries. Especially the shower gel mentioned by another reviewer\u2026Good-sized couch which was comfortable. Liked the artistically arranged fruit plate too. Very large flat screen TV. You could dial up a particular lighting style for bedroom and bathroom, ranging from restfully dim, to brightly lit. Unfortunately none of the possibilities provided a directional bedside reading light which did not disturb your companion (Especially the \u201creading\u201d option). It looked as though the directional downlights which would have worked as reading lights had been swivelled to light up the centre of the bed for some reason. Hotel employees were very pleasant and helpful, judging by the limited contact we had with them. We had dinner in the hotel restaurant (Brasserie Les Saveurs) because we were tired and had an early start again the next day. After seven weeks of travelling and eating exotic food we opted for a hamburger! Service was very slow, and then the hamburger was lukewarm when it came, though the accompanying fries were hot. As well there was a nice amuse bouche, bread basket, and my husband also had an appetizer which he liked. Would have liked to order dessert as well, but did not risk it since service was so very slow for other course.

Anyway she then told me that they hotel was \"running full\" and that the room that I \"didnt book\" was $40 more, i told her i would go down the road to the Ritz or Raffles, then she quickly found me a room, but honestly I really wish she didn't, I really have never felt so uncomfortable in my life, I should have gone down the road to another hotel. I cant believe that this hotel would be arguing for $40 more, lt was like she was bartering with me. Its really not like me to feel uncomfortable in this type of environment, i meen i grew-up in these hotels, my dad was a GM for this group of hotels (SPG) for many years so i really did live and grow up in these places, anyway this lady really did manages to make me feel very unwelcome. On the plus side this hotel does have the best rooms in Singapore, they are just wonderful really great. Very nicely furbished and quality furnishings. Bose sound system, LCD TV and one in the bathroom too (didn't work). The Remede products in the bathroom were very nice, loved the shower gel. Beds are to die for, they are the really nice St Regis beds (just like the Sheraton Sweet sleeper or Westin heavenly beds) wonderful. Cant say much for this hotels location its up what i would call the Wrong end of Orchard Road, and it doesn't have much of a view from the rooms, Nothing like the view i had at the Ritz out over the city and singapore flyer!. The rest of the hotel is nothing to wright home about, there is a small lobby a funny restaurant that looks out onto a brick wall and a very small swimming pool area, its just this hotel doesnt have any atmosphere, i really dont know whats its missing but yeah its a strange hotel in a strange location. I must say that while all the staff came across very inexperienced a few of them were on the ball, like the front desk manager, without me even complaining he sent up a card apologizing for the poor check-in and offered me complimentary breakfast, then when i checked out I was offered to keep the room untill my flight later that afternoon, which was nice.

The staff and as such the service is what really sets this hotel apart from the competition. True first class service: no issue, no problem, no matter, tiny details! The rooms and suites are absolutely the best in Singapore - style, class & comfort! The bathrooms are luxurious - loads of stunning rather unusual marble and heated mirrors (so they dont mist up!). The Spa too is superb although management of the Spa is the truly only weak link at the hotel. The Spa staff offer the best hotel treatments in Singapore and they have no competition! None! The Chinese Restaurant must be one of Singapores best. The Italian is boring and feels like a bit of an after thought while the main dining room works well for breakfast and lunch but dinner is a bit 'Las Vegas' with coloured fountains that are simply too active and busy for a relaxing fine dining experience. Management of the hotel is top notch. The Concierge Team headed up by Ian Tan cannot be faulted - perfect every time!

Something is just not right here??? We were really looking forward to the end journey of our European leg to unwind for 5 nights at the St Regis.. But it was a continual process of errors and problems and a real let down. The Hotel itself is New and beautiful, and incredible chandeliers and decor throughout.. but for a wonderful stay this hotel needs to sort out its electrical problems.. we had lights that didnt work, the tv in the bathroom wouldnt change channels, the aircon would sporadically go on and off, they did have an engineer look at the problem however it continued not to work effectively.. The butler(s) were lovely but it would have been nice to have our own kettle to make a cup of tea or coffee as opposed to have to call everytime we wanted one.. It just felt uncomfortable to have to continually call them, and an intrusion into our privacy.. There is 101 switches near the side tables that we just gave up on trying to turn lights on, lights off, back light, hall light, it was just over the top and frustrating to keep on trying to get it right.. We found the bed rather a little to firm for our liking and were amazed that there was no options for pillows.. I like a large pillow but my husband doesnt and ended up with a very sore neck after 5 nights.. The staff were gracious, however on 4 different occassions we asked questions to staff to be greeted with \"I am from china\" ?? The staff themselves were lovely and tried very hard to be polite but had no understanding of any english, this was both in the Ya Ting restaurant when we asked for another bottle of wine and in our suite when they came for a turn down service and we asked what time tomorrows newspaper would be delivered.. Hmmm? The spa facilities were lovely but lacked a certain vibe, actually there was a complete lack of ambience throughout the entire hotel, one could attribute that to the current low occupancy, but not in this case, we have been to many newly opened hotels and there always seemed to be some energy and excitement, but not here.. The food at Le saveurs was very reasonably priced and the breakfast was possibly there best service, food of a very high standard.. Also the staff here were excellent. Overall I would recommend certainly booking a table at one of the restaurants at the St regis, but check in somewhere else..
