This visit we stayed at Konfidentiel, because of their room per floor layout and because of the good trip advisor reviews. We thoroughly enjoyed our 5 nights at the hotel Konfidentiel. The location is amazing, centrally located and right on the corner of Rue St Honore with all its shopping and cafes. Les halles metro and RER are very close for easy travel and most right bank places of interest are within an easy walk. We did a lot of walking this trip and found our room at the konfidentiel a welcome refuge. We were on the first floor. The lift takes you to your door. The room was a great size, with a very large bed - practically lost my partner in it. The room was beautifully decorated with designer wallpaper, plush blue carpet, two large windows with a view of the street, a table and two chairs, a safe, minibar, large TV, aircon, and a beautiful almost new bathroom with elements of old Paris. No bath, but the shower was a good size with a large shower head and good water pressure. The room was serviced daily and the staff in general were polite, helpful and friendly - especially the delightful Esteban. The only negative I can think of is that on some nights there is a bit of noise on the street until about 10pm. Because we were out and about early this trip we did not have the hotel breakfast (20euros). However, the cafe next door was fabulous. Had the duck for lunch one day and it was so good. The hotel is small and the staff pride themselves on giving individual service. Next time in Paris we will be staying at the Hotel Konfidentiel.", "Date": "March 11, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Rome, Italy", "Title": "\u201cTrendy fancy hotel in the hearth of Paris !!\u201d", "Author": "sanmezzus", "ReviewID": "UR125347303", "Content": "The hotel is just amazing and all completely renewed, a room each floor for a total privacy vacation and all are very well decorated in a new parisienne chic !!

Each room is decorated in a famous person or place of frances' history. I chose the marie antonette room, but stayed a few days in the room with the famous bridge and in the suite duplex. all the rooms were elegantly decorated, comfortable and large size bed, very new, had a view from windows that opened, bathroom was marble, shower was amazing, so were the hotel toiletries! Just my style! I have a bad back so mattress is extremely important and I slept late everyday, one day Sana came to check up on me because she was worried and she came bearing coffee and croissants...YUMMY! Housekeeping was amazing, they change the sheets everyday and clean towels everyday. The A/C was so cool (you must see it for your self) TV is state of the art, everything you need you can access from the tv. Location is perfect...I walked the entire city and found my way back easily. The employees speak english and are very friendly, helpful, accomodating and knowledgeable. Estaban and his staff are always on hand and truly want you to enjoy their beautiful city and get in all the wonderful sites.The restuarant in hotel is supurb! you must try it even if you don't stay there. The atmosphere is so cool, its a cave downstairs, but so elegant. I had such a great time and made so many friends that I kept in touch with and now I am planning to go back to visit again. I hope that you will take a trip to paris and stay in this amazing hotel.

The hotel is very small with only six rooms (i think).. One on each floor. I stayed in the King of France room, which was located on the first floor. In the beginning I was a little worried about noice from the street, but the hotel is actually located on a very quiet street just between rue de rivoli and faubourg st. honere... There was no need to worry at all... also excellent location! The rooms are excellent, clean and comfortable! The bed was excellent! Its a brand new hotel but in a 15th century building and the combination works perfectly! As said before its a small hotel so the hotel cant offer a lot of extra facilities, but for a couple of days in Paris for leisure.. its perfect! The hotel have a restaurant but we chose not to try it but it looked nice. The breakfast served in the room is excellent! The staff is very friendly and tries to be helpful in any way they can. However I dont think they are professional trained and I think they should be in a hotel of this standard! Also the hotel dont have there own umbrellas.. They have some.. but of very mixed standard! This should be fixed and would help on the overall impression of the hotel and the service... The minibar I think is too expensive, but I guess thats to be expected....

We booked thestandard double room last minute due a last minute holiday and were very nervous because there were not many reviews or information about the hotel, so we crossed our finger and hoped for the best.. In a nutshell we loved the hotel, the location and Paris so much, we ended up extending and spending 5 nights there!! The hotel is a small, elegant boutique accomodation, with 6 rooms, each floor being one room, so they are a comfortable size, with nice windows overlooking the street below.. the furniture and fit out are beautiful and the rooms are so clean and beutifully decorated with french style furniture and fittings.. The hotel is located 5 minutes walk away from the Louvre museum, where we spent every morning sitting eating fresh pastries from one of the many bakeries around the hotel (although our favourite was just around the corner called Boulangerie Gosselin..ask the staff to direct you). It is also very close walk to the Le Marais district where you get a more authentic taste of Paris with little boutique shops in small alley ways, and the night life is great around the hotel also.. there is a grocery store right around the corner too which is always handy! It is also around the corner (i.e. a minutes walk) to the Metro (Louvre Museum stop) which is very convenient! Aothough we walked everywhere in Paris and only took the Metro once, the location is really quite close to the nice boutique areas like Saint Germaine and Notre Dam. Paris was the first stop of our one month trip through france and Italy and we only stayed at 4 star hotels, and i can honestly say that the Hotel Konfidentiel was not only the nicest accomodation but the staff were genuinely friendly and went above and beyond our expectations in helping us around the city and more.. They even helped us plan the rest of our very unplanned trip and gave us fantastic advice and great places to visit in other parts of the country.. There was language barrier problem, as only some of the staff staff are fluent in English (as with most of France), but they knew enough to assist us with our needs. The food at the hotel is amazing, dinner is fine dining at its best with beautiful french gastronomy and excellent wines.. dining at the hotel is a must, they have an underground restaurant area that is so beauitiful and different, however we chose to get the real Parisienne experience and dine on the few tables they had on the street footpath.. so much fun! ALSO, the photos on the website are the real deal and we were not miseld in any way as is the case so many time with other places... it actually is that pretty and nice! I could write on and on about our experiences, but in summary this hotel is exceptional, and provides a great central location for your stay in Paris, an elegant and clean room and beautiful bathrooms, fantastic staff, and i cant imagine anyone being unhappy staying here.. THANKS to all the staff for your help if you read this.. it was by far the most memorable (positive) experience on our Europe trip... Good luck to everyone else!!", "Date": "May 9, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "5.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Nice, France", "Title": "\u201cKonfidentiel is our preferred residence -Excellence is the cornerstone of our business, the Konfidentiel also.\u201d", "Author": "AMG1973", "ReviewID": "UR105051983", "Content": "Hotel Konfidentiel aligns itself to the core elements of our own business ethic; - dedication to service and client management - solutions to all challenges before they may arise - bespoke offerings to any client requirement - professionalism, discretion and excellent customer service Finally, the restaurant is truly worth visiting, culinary innovation and exceptional cuisine.
