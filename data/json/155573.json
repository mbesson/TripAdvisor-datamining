I was somewhat familiar with the historic Hotel Victoria since I've stayed a few times before. I phoned to book a date and was dealt with by Peter. He was friendly and welcoming. I knew about the lack of onsite parking and did not require a car since the location is so central and convenient. It is a short walking distance from Union Station and many attractions. I am 62, so when I say walking distance, I mean it. There is parking nearby if needed. My daughter and I arrived at 2 p.m., too early for check in, and wanted to store our bags so that we could shop. The wonderful desk clerk, Erskine, told us we were welcome to go ahead and put our things into the room since it was ready. Our room was on the 5th floor, small and lovely. It was stylishly decorated, very clean and comfortable with a modern bathroom. There wasn't much of a view but didn't care since we weren't planning on spending our time in the room staring out of the window. The hotel is smoke free and smelled fresh. Because of the modest size and the historic elements of this hotel, it does not have every convenience a larger, newer facility might have, however, any potential needs are addressed in the hotel information guide found in the room. We had a question on check-in and when we returned later in the afternoon, Erskine had resolved it in a more than satisfactory manner Although there is a subway stop available near the hotel, we found the walk to the Eaton Centre for shopping to be quite short. ***Note to visitors...We discovered that \"The Bay\" gives a 15% discount to non-locals. We showed our Hotel Victoria key and saved quite a bit of money. There are varied dining opportunities nearby from fast food to gourmet. After a leisurely dinner, we returned to find Brian, at the front desk of the hotel. He was knowledgable and helped us with directions to a major grocery store and gave us advice about nearby entertainment. Again, all was in walking distance. In the morning, we had breakfast at the onsite restaurant \"Over Easy\". It's open from early morning until 3 p.m. The menu included both breakfast and lunch items and was good value for the money. We checked out and were not yet ready to go home, so we appreciated having our bags stored gratis until we were finished with our city adventures later in the day. Hotel Victoria is a terrific choice for people attending concerts, sporting events and shopping. Unlike some larger city hotels, it does not give you the feeling of being impersonal. The staff does their best to be polite, accomodating and helpful without appearing pretentious. This hotel is excellent value for the money. I wouldn't stay anyplace else.", "Date": "March 15, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Toronto", "Title": "\u201cSmall in room size, big on service and location.\u201d", "Author": "travelbugcheri", "ReviewID": "UR126073832", "Content": "Stayed here on a weeknight in a standard queen room to attend a concert just down the street (200m) at the Sony Centre. Reservations: Called directly and received a better rate than posted online and when I mentioned we were seeing a concert, was just directed to show my tickets at check-in for an additional 10% off the rate! Check in- No hotel parking, that was fine. We parked at an outside parking lot at Sherbourne and Front Street. $5 overnight until at 6am. (we left at 8 and it wasn't a problem) Its a 10 minute walk, but it's $5 parking downtown and we each only had a small overnight bag. Check in was fine, very friendly and professional staff, and it only took a few minutes. Room- We were in 206 (I think). The room was small, which I expected, spotless and the bed was comfy with great linen. The bathroom was fine and had everything we needed. Hot water came immediately and the towels were nice and fluffy. Although there were only two. I'm sure getting more would have been only a phone call to the desk away. There was no view, I didn't really care. This might bother some people. Good quality sleep, we heard no street noise or noises from other guests. Location- Awesome! Right in the middle of everything. Close to numerous dinner choices, and the concert theatre we were attending. I picked this hotel for this very reason. It's also close to the ACC, the subway, CN Tower, Queens Quay and Eaton Centre. Price- Not too bad, 120 with tax after the discount. IS it worth this much? I wish I could have gotten a better deal, and would have been happier if I had. So I don't think so. Overall- Reading the reviews you should be able to determine that its a small hotel that is doing its best right smack in the center of downtown Toronto. Would I stay again? Most definitely, if I were attending another concert close by. If I could get the same price on priceline et al for a 4 or 5 star?

This is a classic Boutique Hotel by definition, very European in nature.

A pleasant twist was the bathroom. Usually in European-style boutique hotels the bathrooms are tiny but ours was quite spacious. All areas of the hotel were very, very clean and well maintained and the 5-6 staff members we encountered over our 2 night stay were extremely pleasant and professional. The location is perfect if you enjoy walking a city. Close to a lot of places you want to be. Note, try not to get there during rush hour traffic because at those hours you will not be able to stop in front of the hotel to drop off your luggage and check-in. This is a very small inconvenience in exchange for such a great location on Toronto's famous Yonge street. I'm not sure what the exact rush hours are, but you may want to ask when you call for reservations. In any event if that does happen you can pull-over around the block.

We wanted a downtown area at a reasonable price. This is often an oxymoron when it comes to Toronto. However, we were pleasantly surprised that this hotel, located at Yonge and Wellington, lived up to its website hype. Though located in a historic building built over a 100 years ago, it has been recently refurbished to a very comfortable standard. The room we were in is small by today's standard. There was just enough space for two double beds, a small stand alone closet and a table. The flat screen TV hung from the wall. The bathroom had a toilet, sink and shower. The beds were very comfy. The walls are a bit thin so noisy neighbours can be a problem. The staff, both front and housekeeping, were very friendly and accommodating. The only real difficulty with this hotel is the lack of a drop-off/pick-up zone. Because it is located right on busy Yonge St. there is no loading zone. If you attempt to stop to unload or load during rush hour, you could be inviting an expensive fine and a lot of annoyed drivers. The best bet is to stop on the side street, Melinda St., and walk a few feet. Go to their website to see if they have any special offers. They are currently promoting a $102 per night for 2 nights.

My room faced Yonge St. but the street noise was not an issue on any of the nights during my stay. I know it's only a 3 star hotel but my only complaint, while 2 actually, would be 1) no bag liner for the ice bucket (grocery store bags for fresh produce worked well) and 2) no glassware for drinks, only small, flimsy plastic cups (a trip to a dollar store rectified that problem). The basement area where the ice machine is can be described as claustrophobic but clean and also a small book exchange table with a couple of good reads. If I had a car, I would be put off by no on site parking, but no need for a car with the proximity of the hotel to downtown venues, entertainment, dining and shopping.

At the time of this review, I expect the reno is still undeway. The lobby is very modern and very clean. At check in, I was somewhat surprised that the front desk person requested my credit card be pre-authorized for $125 for incidentals. Further, an old school carbon imprint was taken. Not concerning, but a little antiquated for 2011. I was graciously afforded a room upgrade from my Expedia Elite card. Queen Standard to Queen Business. Not sure how they differ, but expect it is based on a a dozen or so square feet and $20-$30 in rate. A quick turn around the corner and into the elevator is where I discovered that the reno was not entirely complete. Beat up and scracthed, it obviously fell lower on the list of priorities. As well, the hallways of the fourth floor looked unaddressed. When I entered my room, it was very late and I could not find the light switch, which in a hotel is typically located right at the entrance of the room. I felt my way through the dark and turned on a lamp. I was pleasantly surprised. The room was small, but all furnishing very new, very clean and a full compliment. Flat screen television, ipod dock/alarm clock*, iron, housecoat, hair dryer, the usuals. Missing is a minibar or cooler. Also, the alarm clock was poorly chosen. It had calculatror screen colour rather than LED, so cannot be viewed during the night. Also, the maid did not disengage the alarm from the night before, so I was alarmed an hour earlier than I had hoped. The windows to my room opened nicely to a centre atrium. There must have been a steel roof, because I heard the light pitter-patter of the rain throughout the night. The bathroom was small, but the shower had more pressure than any hotel I think I've ever been to. The location is second to none. 200 or so metres from the train station, the subway system is directly out front. Restaurants everywhere and some of the main touristsites of the city including The Air Canada Centre, Rogers Centre and Sony Centre or Hummingbird (whatever they call it these days). It's also two blocks from financial district. While it is not a super-organized franchise hotel, it is quaint, cozy and quiet (with only fifty-some rooms). I think that is why I liked it so much. I got a great deal on the rate, but I think I would stay here regardless. Star rating seems to be three on a lot of sites. They definitely deserve 3.5 and maybe even four.

The room came with big television screen, free Wifi and an iPhone/iPod docking station. The room and bathroom were both clean and the shower was also brilliant.

The CN Tower/Rogers Centre and Air Canada Centre are all within easy walking distance, as is the waterfront.

We found the hotel staff to be very helpful and imformative. Just a tip: As others have mentioned, you will have to pay to park at a garage down the street, as there is no parking for the hotel on site. There is also nowhere to pull up to unload your luggage in front of the Hotel (Yonge Street is super busy!), so you'll need to park in a garage & wheel your stuff in. We parked behind the Novotel Hotel & the rate was $14/day, which was super reasonable in comparison to other parking garage rates we saw. Also, the Hotel has free wireless & a computer in the lobby, but there is nowhere to print in the lobby (you have to ask a staff member to assist you with printing if you need to print something, which is not a big deal, but there is not a standard \"business center\").

Nothing wrong with 'em at all. But if you're spending your own money, you can easily save a thousand dollars or so by staying in this perfectly nice hotel. Smack in the middle of downtown, it's just a few blocks from the business district, St. Lawrence Market, the CN tower, Hockey Hall of Fame, whatever. So the location is just about perfect. The rooms seem to be recently-renovated, perfectly clean, nice bathroom and shower, flat screen TV, comfortable beds, and a nice little desk where you can set up your computer and hook up to the free WiFi. Other reviewers have said the rooms are small, and sure. There's no living room--you won't be entertaining guests in here. No separate couch or anything like that, and there isn't a bunch of space for kids to run around. But the rooms aren't cramped, the bathroom's got plenty of space, you're not bumping into things, and there's certainly enough room to work at the desk. I've stayed in some postage stamp rooms in New York City and that's not what this is. It's a small, clean room, with a good sized bathroom and plenty of workspace. And the price is right. There's no parking in the building. But if you're coming in by car you're gonna save another $30 per night by following the clerk's advice and parking two blocks over at the Municipal Garage. Parking at the big hotels around here, and at the other garages, runs about $40 to $50 per 24 hours! (Check the signs--they all have a \"maximum daily rate\" that only lasts from 6am to 6pm. You also have to pay for the other 12 hours, from 6pm to 6am.)

Honestly, when I read some of the other reviews, I was a little worried about staying here. But when we showed up, it turned out to be a wonderful and delightful place.

The fact that we didn't have to take transportation is a fabulous thing in itself, because that could add up if needing to take taxi's, etc. I stayed in a room with four people (2 double beds) The rooms were very spacious, very clean, and we even had a great view of the city where we could literally look out of our window and point and say \"Let's go THERE tonight!\" Admittedly, when we first arrived, there was an issue with our 2 friends who were staying in a seperate room. They didn't have anything saying that they were staying there and all the rooms were full at that point. They did, however, accomodate them by allowing them to stay in my room, which was kind because they're not supposed to do that.

We haven't gotten any reply or acknowledgement To Whom It May Concern. . . I wanted to write this email to you as soon as we returned home to inform you of the horrible experience that myself and my husband had at your hotel over the past three days. We arrived Thursday afternoon to a very rude man behind the reception desk. He didn't offer to help us with the bags, told us nothing about the amenities or services of the hotel. My husband unloaded the car about a block away and drove to find parking while I carried both of our bags and additional items about a block to the lobby. I tried to get the attention of the man at the reception desk, and when he didn't help me with the bags, I literally had to ask a stranger on the street to help me open the door and carry our things. After packing everything into the elevator while my husband parked our car, I was very disappointed by the size of our room. It was so small and cheaply decorated it was insulting. We live in Rochester with in laws in Buffalo so we spend a lot of time traveling to Toronto for various events and wanted to try a more historic hotel. From your website and literature, I am significantly surprised by your lack of quality. The bed was only a few feet off of the ground and the headboard was scratched and looked like it was going to fall off of the wall. The chair that was at the desk had a broken back, one of the doors on the mirrored closet was off of the track and broken. These items, paired with a lovely view of an alleyway just made for a more insulting first experience. You should also be aware of some additional problems with the room and the service that we experienced during our stay. The shower was broken in multiple places - the plumbing into the shower head wasn't tightened correctly so one stream of water actually shot out over the top of the shower door onto the floor of the bathroom and the second sprout of water sprayed up to the lighting fixture in the ceiling. My husband was able to redirect the one stream of water, but the other still sprayed over the top of the shower door. My husband used the bathroom and thought there was a problem with the toilet when the tank continued to run, so he removed the top of the toilet tank and we COULD NOT BELIEVE WHAT WE SAW. Inside the toilet tank we found unopened bottles of wine coolers being stored in the toilet tank. I have no idea how long they were there, but the caps were rusted shut and the water was totally brown. I don't have to tell you how disgusting this is. We took pictures of the toilet tank, which I have attached. Throughout our stay there seemed to be a general disregard for guests by the staff. Friday night we were waiting for the elevator and two employees from the cleaning crew had large grey bins of towels and other laundry. They literally pushed past us to get into the elevator and said nothing. I HOPE i don't have to explain that this is not proper etiquette in a hotel setting or any setting. I also noticed a lot of signs about not smoking in the hotel and we stayed on the fourth floor and I can tell you that the people staying on our floor were certainly smoking. The hotel smelled horrible. I informed someone working at the front desk, which seemed very disinterested. Over our stay we informed various people at the front desk about our issues and not ONCE did anyone offer to repair anything, compensate us in anyway and when we checked out we again told the man at the front desk about our experience and he said he would inform the manager. He then thanked us for not yelling at him like other guests have in the past. So, since we got no satisfaction or compensation, I felt that I would put this in writing and send it along to you. We feel so insulted that this is the first thing that I have to do when returning from our weekend. As I said earlier, we travel to Toronto a lot and wanted to try a different hotel. We have stayed all over downtown and I promise you that: 1. We will NEVER stay at your hotel again 2. We WILL tell everyone who asks about our vacation exactly where we stayed and the experience that we had. I am also a corporate trainer who travels extensively and believe me, my employees and other trainers would love to know about this experience since they travel often. 3.

I'd thoroughly recommend it. It's in a fantastic location within walking distance of most of the main sights and loads of great bars and restaurants. The staff were friendly and helpful. Our room was small but clean with a good sized bathroom. It was located at the back of the hotel which meant it was very quiet. A room facing Yonge Street might have been more noisy. A flat screen TV with a good selection of channels was a bonus! I'd recommend heading to the St Lawrence district (about 2 minutes away) to find cafes, bars and restaurants rather than heading up to more touristy places on Yonge Street. We asked the hotel about tours to Niagara and were recommended to use Niagara VIP tours. Our guide was friendly and knowledgable but if you do choose this option please bear in mind that you will be travelling in a mini-bus/van rather than a coach, which was very cramped and not what I would class as VIP! We didn't realise until afterwards that there are loads of different tour companies out there offering a variety of packages, so shop around. You should also be aware that a 15% tip is 'expected', plus tax, which made the trip more expensive than we anticipated. All in all we had a great time in Tornonto and we were very pleased we had chosen to stay at the Victoria.", "Date": "October 1, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Texas", "Title": "\u201cOur stay was great; Erskin at the front desk is awesome\u201d", "Author": "caleb05", "ReviewID": "UR43951154", "Content": "We stayed 4 nights while attending a convention at another hotel nearby.

I would say that it had some drawbacks, the outside of the building looked nice however the inside lobby and general check in area just seemed old. The elevator seemed old but these are minor details. It did however set the mood for the rest of the stay, you could tell it was an old apartment building converted into a hotel. The room we had on the 3rd floor was TINY, walked right into the bed and desk. The bathroom was a decent size and probably the saving grace. It was the only thing modernized in the hotel room. The place had the feel of the national lampoons European vacation to it and the first thing I said was I felt like it was a hotel the Griswalds stayed at. BIG negative to me was the fact that we had to use the public parking around the block, which wouldn't have been bad except that there were a lot of beggars and it wasn't a good idea to show luggage or a touristy look coming from the garage. It got the job done, the bed was confortable and it had a TV, it was perfect for a rest when you wanted to just stop for a bit but then go right back to what you were doing around town.

It cost $15.00 to park there from 7:00 pm to 5:00 pm the next day which is quite reasonable for downtown Toronto. We had breakfast in Over Easy downstairs. Again good prices,and good service.

Parking for the hotel was not included, but very close by in Commerce Court on Wellington St. For approx 28 hours, our parking fee was $24.00, which was reasonable. We also ate at \"Over Easy\" the adjoining all-day breakfast restaurant. The restaurant was very clean and bright, and the food was fresh and homemade. If you're looking for good value (by Toronto standards) on a night's stay with lots of nearby amenities, and nothing luxurious, this is an excellent pick.", "Date": "January 6, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "1", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "London, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cWalked out after seeing the rooms\u201d", "Author": "markasaurus", "ReviewID": "UR10488910", "Content": "We read good reviews on this website and thought the location was convenient since it's a few blocks from the train station.

The room wasn't completely uninhabitable, but for $130 a night I was expecting something better than a flophouse. Most of the furnishings looked ancient, the rug was obviously old and not clean, and the room was an odd shape and also very dark. The only window looked into a brick air shaft. We went to the desk to complain, and they explained that there weren't that many other rooms in our price range. We got the keys to a more recently renovated room on the 2nd floor, but it wasn't much better. The light-colored rug was almost black in front of the door and the room was tiny. The window was about 5 feet about the floor with a through-the-wall air conditioner below it. We checked out and found a room at the Day's Inn Hotel next to the old Maple Leaf Gardens.

The elevator very slow. The bathroom was clean except for the /bathtub/shower walls. Luckily, the weather was pleasant. Otherwise, the wall air conditioner would not have been sufficient to cool the room. The staff apparently knew nothing about the city and did not understand English.

When asked about places to eat dinner, they were not entirely sure which way to point. There is a cafe downstairs. However, $12 for cereal, milk and a muffin seemed expensive. Walk one block to Richtree and eat a full breakfast or whatever you want for less money. Try the PATH, the underground mall, for everything you would ever need.

I was hesitant at first because of the other reviews posted but from past experience I decided to go with my gut, and with what Frommers had recommended. I made the reservation online and received a prompt response. About a week before we left I emailed them and asked to ensure we received a non-smoking room. I just didn't want to take any chances and all was perfect upon arrival. We checked in about one hour ahead of schedule which was nice b/c we wanted to get out and about asap. The staff behind the reception desk seemed to change often which we found amusing. They were all pleasant, not overly, but pleasant and easy to deal with. As indicated in other reviews, the room was small but clean, and this was more important to me. Clean is a must. The bathroom was quaint and our view was, well, a brick wall but we spent very little time in the hotel room so we weren't worried. The temperature rose as the week went on and the air conditioning worked well. Each day we returned to find our room spotless. The one drawback was the lack of a munchie machine in the hotel. This sounds silly I know but when Game 5 of the Stanley Cup is on you need your munchies. There was a pop machine and ice machine in the basement though. Next door to the hotel was a little newstand/convenience store. We only noticed it on day 3 or so and wish we had found it earlier. It was called International News. The woman there was so nice and welcoming and very chatty. It was great. She asked where we were from and where we were going, etc. This was a great place to grab snacks to sneak into the Jays game. The only problem is it closed around 7pm, but that's ok. The woman there made up for it. This hotel is all about location, location, location. It was about a 5 min walk from the Eatons Centre. Yonge Street is incredible, full of shopping and restaurants. I highly recommend Eggspectations just up the road and Shopsy's across the street. Yum. It was also practically right next door to the Hockey Hall of Fame. This made it easy to run around, come back and rest a minute, and then keep exploring. The one thing I really liked about Hotel Victoria is that they were not all gushy over us. We would come and go, they would say hello, and that was about it. The night before we checked out I was stressing b/c our flight was only at 8pm and the thought of dragging our luggage around terrified me. I asked the girl at the desk (I think her name was Carla?) if they would keep our luggage after check out for the day and she said it was no problem and it would be locked up until we returned. Fantastic. This was a big help and a huge relief. One more thing...we never heard a sound from the other rooms or even in the hallways. If you want a pool, a fabulous in house restaurant, and lots of room....do not go here but if you want good value in a great downtown location then this is the place for you.
