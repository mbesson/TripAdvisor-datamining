We stayed in the building across the garden and our room was wonderful. It was spacious and decorated to such a high standard that we were very impressed. The bathroom was big too, especially the shower, which is so unusual in a budget hotel. Also the wardrobe and drawer space was much more than we needed, again unusual. The reception staff were all so friendly and helpful and the map they gave us was very useful as it had a suggested walking route around the city which took in all you needed to see and prevented us from getting lost. The breakfast room was plenty big enough and prettily decorated and the food was excellent too. We ate in two nearby restaurants at night which were the Trattoria da Biasini and the Rio Novo. Both had great food and were not expensive in the slightest. The house red wine at 12 euros a litre was superb. If you are arriving at Marco Polo airport then the ATVO shuttle bus is the best way to get to the hotel. The tickets are 5euros for a single or 9 return and they ran exactly on time and only took 15 minutes. As people have said before, the hotel is visible from Piazzale Roma where the bus drops you off, so you can't get lost and it only takes 5 minutes.

Robert G, one of the staff there, deserves particular mention for being funny and cheerful and very helpful in giving us directions on how to get trains to Verona.

There was good variety, and my wife who is gluten-free had plenty to eat while often even at 4 star hotels she will go hungry. The location was good - right near the bus terminal and within walking distance of the train station. However, be prepared for some stairs going over bridges no matter which hotel in Venice you stay at unless you get a private gondola. My only complaint with the hotel itself was the wifi which did not work from our room but did work fine from the lobby.

Priorities were convenient location from our dropoff point, clean/safe, and reasonable pricing. Hotel Olimpia provided these and much more. We took the shuttle from the airport to Piazzale Roma. When you get off the bus, you pretty much look southeast and can see the hotel which is about a 3 minute walk with only two tiny bridges to cross with luggage. Check-in was efficient and we were shown up to our room by the bellhop. We booked on a third party travel website (expedia/orbitz) and were annexed. Reading other reviews, it seems like this may be the case. The annex is next door. There are some stairs and a dimly lit passageway which transiently smelled like garbage, but otherwise our room in the annex seemed safe, relatively quiet, and clean. Room was spacious and clean. We couldn't open our minisafe door and did not request to have it fixed. Heater worked well. Showers and bathroom were clean and nice enough with decent hot water and water pressure. Wi-fi in our room was extremely spotty, but usable enough to get by. Pillows and beds seemed harder than most we'd encountered in Europe, but otherwise our room was fairly quiet. Service was a strong point of the hotel. We had to change our travel plans and make special accommodations including staying an additional night, allowing me to bring a tray of breakfast and hot water up to the room as well as some adjusted housemaid service-- they were extremely understanding and cooperative. English was fairly good at the front desk and service was good despite some mild crowds of people even in the off-season. Serena at the front desk was extremely accommodating and made the hotel feel like our home in Venice for the days we stayed there! Other points - breakfast is quite decent with a wide range of meats/cheeses, cereal, breads, fruits, and great coffee. The garden would have been nice to have breakfast if the weather were warmer. The waitress was efficient, polite, and very helpful. Location-wise, it is near several shops for pizza, kebabs, sandwiches, snacks and easily with decent walking distance of the major sights. While it is not super close to St Marks, the Rialto bridge, or the Accademia, I preferred staying a bit farther away from those places as part of the fun of Venice is wandering around a place where you can't really get too lost. I can't say if this hotel is super busy during the high season given its proximity to the people mover and cruise ships, but hopefully it is less crowded than the hotels near St Marks. Regardless, due to the service they provided, we would certainly consider staying here again for a trip to Venice.

You can take the bus (ATVO) from the airport for 5 euros, and then when you go to the cruise terminal you can take the people mover in the PR for 1 euro; this will drop you off at about a 15 minute walk to the main terminal and there are free shuttles that will take you to the ship. We opted to just go walking and basically got there sooner, but we didn't have heavy luggage either. Anyway, I highly recommend this hotel especially if you are going on a cruise.

HOWEVER, we were advised that checkout time was 11a.m. We woke up early, went out for a stroll after breakfast. We returned to our room at 10:15a.m. and noticed the room was already made, our luggages gone including our carry-ons. When we went down to concierge, our luggages were sitting out in the open. They had taken the liberty to remove our luggages without asking. Furthermore, our passports, wallets, tour documents were still in the in-room safe. We had to go back to the room to retrieve them. No apologies or explanations were offerred. Luckily we are always careful with our important documents when we travel but our electronics were in our carry--ons. I wasn't going to write a review about this incident but on hindsight, I thought things could have turned out to be a nightmare if anything did go missing.

When we arrived we were greeted by friendly staff who helped us find a restaurant for a late meal and then directed us to our room. Only complaint we had was the lobby and back gardens looked lovely but we were taken outside and to another door where we climbed 3 flights of stairs with our luggage to our room. It appeared to us, this adjacent building was occupied by apartment tenants and guests of the hotel. The room was decorated in typical italian decor with a small flat screen tv. The bathroom did have a hair dryer but expect to be in there for an hour as it was quite weak. Bed linens are basic, nothing fancy and the pillows are quiet flat. You will have to get up early if you wish to sit outside in the gardens for breakfast because it fills up fast. The breakfast was extensive with meats, cheeses, buns, danishes, croissants, cereal, fruit, juice, coffee, tea. It was also nice to have access to free internet with a computer in the lobby.

It was a wonderful hotel with a great location. It is less than a five minute walk from the train station (just over three bridges), and about three minute walk from one of the main vaporetto stops (water bus). What I enjoyed the most is the side walk in front of the hotel with a sitting area right along one of the smaller canals. You can just sit there as long as you want without having to order anything. You can also take your breakfast there or go to the back courtyard area which is also a very nice sitting area. The restaurant next door to the hotel was very yummy and offered a good selection of local cuisines. After peaking in several of the rooms, I can tell you that it seems ever room is different. Ours opened up first into a small sitting area with a couch then curved past the bathroom into the bedroom. We had a cute little window that opened and overlooked the garden. There was a real queen size bed for my husband and I and then our daughter slept in the twin size bed that folded out of the wall like a hide-a-bed. The hotel has a computer down stairs with internet access and also free wireless access in the rooms. The only down side was that the wireless was not very strong and difficult to use in our room which was located in a far corner from the lobby. I had no problem using it by the stairs or sitting out along the canal in front of the hotel - which was a much better place to sit and surf anyway. A few other tips for your vencie trip - get a 24 hour or 48 hour vaporetto pass (just like a bus pass but the bus is a boat). You can ride it around town as many times as you like and if you get lost walking around sooner or later you will come to a bus stop. If you decided to do a tour, I highly suggest doing a private water taxi tour in the EVENING. We did ours starting at 6:30 which was a great time to be on the Grand Canal - less traffic and not as hot. After the tour we did a minor canal gondola ride (around 8:30 or 9) which was great. Very quiet and peacefull.

Our rooms were beautifully furnished in the traditional style, the bathroom modern and very clean. We also had a little sitting room attached. The bed was very comfortable and the view over the garden very pleasant. We had a widescreen television in the bedroom and a small one in the sitting room, also fridge and mini bar. It was plenty warm enough for the colder weather. The hotel staff were friendly and helpful from the reception staff to the breakfast waiting staff and the chambermaid, and made our stay very enjoyable. The hotel itself is very close to the Grand Canal, and it is easy to walk to all the major sightseeing places and shops and close to Water bus and Gondola pick-ups. It fronts on a smaller canal and it must be very pleasant to sit out in the warmer months. There is also a very nice garden behind the hotel with seats for sitting out. It is just off a very busy square, but itself in a fairly quiet situation, and there are several very good restaurants a short walk away. The Continental breakfast provided within the price was extremely good and plenty of variety for all tastes. We cannot recommend this hotel highly enough and will definitely stay again if we return to Venice.", "Date": "December 3, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Clute", "Title": "\u201cCharming Hotel with great employees and views\u201d", "Author": "Bucketlist2", "ReviewID": "UR88842694", "Content": "Hotel Olympia is a charming hotel with a great location for cruise travelers and tourist.

Venice can be a rather expensive place to visit, but we felt that we got a great value in the Olimpia. We had a double superior room (#110) and it was very spacious compared to other European hotels we had stayed in. It was also kept very clean and well tended.

We arrived at the hotel around 2pm so we were able to check into the room immediately. We were on the top floor, 4th floor. The porter took our luggage up for us as only the two of us were able to fit into the tiny elevator. The only reason why I'm giving the room 3 stars is because it was quite small as it was on what appeared to be on an attic level. I'm not sure of the size of the rooms on the levels below compared to the top floor but it was for only one night. The 3 stars for value is due to the room size and the current exchange rate - the rate ended up being $262.00 on my credit card. I am aware of smaller rooms in Europe and it's unfortunate the euro dropped significantly since the time the reservation was made. At least the prompt and friendly service and location made up for some of this. Though the room was quite small, the bathroom was very large and the entire room very clean. We were able to see the cruise ships from the bedroom window the next day! The location is excellent - take the express bus from Marco Polo airport to the Piazza le Roma and you will see the hotel. The only drawback - you must take your luggage down a set of stairs, across the walkway, up a set of stairs, over the bridge, and down a set of stairs, and then down a couple more stairs to get to the walkway to the hotel. Some previous reviewers simply stated going over one bridge - I was under the impression it would be a flat brige. No. There are stairs on each side of the bridge making it a bit of a task after a long flight so take your time when doing this. Otherwise, the location is great as I saw other hotels I had looked at further away that would have been difficult to get to by bus and foot. The train station is nearby but the bus to Piazza le Roma is closest and your best and inexpensive option (3 euro pp) to get to the hotel. We saw many people lugging suitcases throughout Venice. Roberto and the rest of the desk staff were very accommodating and friendly! The continental breakfast included was very nice with an extensive variety of foods and you had the option of ordering food cooked to order for a nominal price. The staff noticed my companion hadn't come down for breakfast in the morning and even offered us food even though the breakfast was over! The hotel seems to be situated close to shops, restaurants and major attractions.

A porter took up our bags - the elevator didn't have room for us and the luggage (elevator barely fits 2 people). We spent 2 nights there and were delighted with the service and helpfulness of the desk clerks. The only problem is the 2 bridges which must be crossed from Plaza Roma. Lugging suitcases up and over the bridges wasn't fun, but we didn't see any hotels that were accessible without a bridge adventure. There were porters at Plaza Roma, but they were quite expensive (80 euros as I recall), so we opted to schlepp them ourselves. It really isn't too difficult if you take your time. We finally did find a ramp from the Plaza which eliminated one bridge. From the Plaza to the port in a several minute bus ride. There's also a \"people mover\" if you want to walk to the port from the plaza. After the bridge adventure, though, we opted to wait for the bus to the port.

Unusually for Venice, the hotel has the whole of the ground floor, giving more space for reception, bar and breakfast room - and the delightful garden at the rear was a real bonus.

Staff: All of the staff members were very helpful, front desk, dining room and housekeeping. We arrived early in the day (10:30 am) and were able to store our bags until the room was ready in the afternoon. Facilities: The building is a little old and space in the main building is tight (the elevator, like many in Europe, can fit maybe one person and one large bag at a time). However, there is a nice garden with some open space and chairs out back and there is an annex building. We stayed there and had one of the largest hotel rooms we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d ever seen in Europe. Both the bedroom and the bath were very large, with lots of storage space and floor space for multiple bags. Both our room and the common areas were kept tidy and clean, although the lobby was a little worn. Breakfast was included and they dining area was comfortable with a nice selection of breads, cheeses, fruits, cereals, meats, etc. Coffee was delicious! Highlights: The location was a plus for us. The hotel is within eye-sight of the Piazzale Roma and the People Mover to the cruise port. That made getting from the airport to the hotel very easy (3 euros via the ATVO Fly Bus). It was just a two minute walk from the bus to the hotel, which does include going up and over one bridge, but you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll have that just about anywhere in Venice. Leaving for our cruise was just as easy and it took less than 15 minutes to get to our cruise terminal. It was about a 20-25 minute walk to the Rialto Bridge or Piazza San Marco, but we actually liked the walk back. It was great for getting some gelato and strolling slowly back to the hotel. Plus, we got to see a lot of different parts of Venice depending on which way we walked back. Areas for improvement: The shower didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have a shelf or a holder for soap or shampoo, so we had to take a cup and use that to put the soap in while in the shower. Also, the Wi-Fi does not extend to the rooms in the garden annex, so that was not good. The common areas could be updated as well, but for the price, this is a very good value. Overall impression: For the price, this is a well run and decent place to stay. If you like to walk and are interested in saving money getting from the airport to your hotel, this is a great money saver because you don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have to pay for a water bus or taxi and can use the money you save to spend on more important things\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6like gelato! Nearby transportation: ATVO Fly Bus stops in Piazzale Roma, which you can see from the hotel. There is also a vaporetto stop in Piazzale Roma so you can easily catch one of the main routes to go to or from Piazza San Marco or other main locations in town. Additionally, the People Mover (which costs 1 euro) to and from the main cruise port is in Piazzale Roma as well so it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s very convenient if you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re doing a cruise originating or arriving in Venice.", "Date": "September 6, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Oklahoma City, Oklahoma", "Title": "\u201cgreat hotel, good price\u201d", "Author": "oklahoma12", "ReviewID": "UR78003248", "Content": "The hotel was clean, good food, the staff was very helpful.", "Date": "September 2, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Bethesda, Maryland", "Title": "\u201cA good option - convenient location, good service\u201d", "Author": "Gertrude01", "ReviewID": "UR77139513", "Content": "I stayed at the Hotel Olimpia in August with my husband and 2 teenage daughters.

Basically, after complaining to them 3 times all they have come up with is an offer of a 30 euros reduction and a bottle of Prosecco on our next visit!.

The location is on a canal and there are tables in front where you can enjoy your own wine or picnic. The hotel itself is clean and charming and the people at the reception desk are very helpful. Our room overlooked the lovely garden in the back of the hotel and was quiet and quite comfortable. Their breakfast was very nice and there are many restaurants in the area with good food and a view of a canal. We were very happy with everything about the hotel itself. There were many other cruisers staying there and all were pleased with the hotel and the helpfulness of the staff. However, if you have any mobility issues or are carrying a lot of luggage, there are some things to consider. We took a taxi to Piazza Roma, then began the trip to the hotel. Keep in mind that you can see the hotel from the Piazza. And we were aware there was a bridge (the Tre Ponte bridges) in between, in fact we \"looked\" at it on a map of Venice that allows you to see a 360 degree view and it appeared to have shallow, deep steps. Not. We had four suitcases (two larger, two small) and my husband's folding mobility scooter. It didn't appear from our view of the bridge online that would be too much of a problem, and we planned out how to get everything over. I even asked a porter at the piazza how much they would charge to move it We were quoted 60 euros (for about 75 meters!) and decided to stick to our original plan. That was a big mistake. Fortunately after one trip, a nice Canadian man staying at the hotel helped with the second trip and one of the hotel managers helped with the mobility scooter so we were able to get there. Going back to the airport though, we gratefully paid the 30 euros the hotel negotiated for us to have porters take the stuff back to the Piazza. Moral of story: don't bring more luggage than you can't easily carry over a bridge that is the equivalent of two flights of steps (one up, one down). This was a difficult proposition after a 21 day cruise. And it's best not to bring a mobility scooter to Venice (or anywhere in Europe for that matter) since it will be unusable and will add immensely to your luggage load.", "Date": "May 29, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Orkney", "Title": "\u201cExcellent service\u201d", "Author": "OrkneySusie", "ReviewID": "UR62930234", "Content": "We had planned an overnight stay at this hotel following our Cruise.

We came in a day early for our cruise as I'm sure many people did, and for that day the rate was two times as much as the following day, after the ships had sailed.

The hotel is situated very close to the coach park Piazzale Roma but is far enough back that noise was never a problem and the scenery still beautiful. Get a good map to find it (we used Rough Guides). It's not hidden away but you will soon learn that the streets and canals of Venice all look the same and one can easily find themselves lost (this is part of the charm though). The location is away from most of the tourist hot spots meaning you miss the crowds! If like us you're on a budget, you're very near the student quarter here - Campo Santa Margherita is a great place for bars and cheap eateries. Yes you will have to carry luggage over a couple of small bridges - you would have to do this anywhere in Venice! So really complaints about this are ridiculous and do not reflect the hotel. If mobility is a problem for you make sure you prearrange luggage details with your hotel. The room we had was a standard double and although fairly small, the room was adequate with a good sized bathroom and was clean and tidy when we arrived. Cleaning was discreet and thorough each day. Breakfast was included and the usual continental affair, but remember to ask for milk if you want it with your tea or coffee, it is not standard in Italy. The staff were friendly and helpful, speaking good english, but you can see they appreciate it when you make an effort to speak a few words in Italian, even if you get it hopelessly wrong! One point however is the wifi which is advertised in the information booklet in your room wasnt infact available and the hotel tried to persuade us to pay 5 euros for 30mins on their computers in the lobby - we didnt bother, there are much cheaper internet cafes around venice (look them up before you go!). A point on the lift - yes it was tiny and could only just fit two of us in. If this bothers you, dont go to Venice, most hotels have tiny lifts, they are working with existing very old architecture! Venice is expensive, very expensive.

The bus station is literally across the canal as well as the water taxis. There was one bridge to cross in order to get to the hotel from the bus, but it was manageable, at least with one suitcase and a shoulder bag. The elevator at the hotel is extremely small, max 2 people I think, but it's never so crowded that you had to wait long. I personally perferred the steps, but after a long day of walking, the elevator did look inviting. The breakfast was nice too. Just like the other reviewer said, there were different types of cereal, meats, cheeses, boiled eggs, fruit, a really good crossiant and a fantastic cappuccino. It's a nice way to start your day off. We did eat at the restaurant next door and the one around the corner and found that they were really good. We didn't have any bad experiences with the restaurants near the hotel. We had read in a lot of reviews to eat off the beaten path as some of the tourist areas can get quite pricey, however, we did find a little place near the Rialto Bridge, don't know the name and couldn't find it again if my life depended on it, but the price was VERY expensive for a toasted pizza bread type thing. It was 15 euros. That's as much or maybe more than what we paid for a dinner. Not to mention it was probably the worst thing we ate on our entire trip. We thought it looked so good through the window we never bothered to check the price. Our fault, but lesson learned. But the Olimpia is a decent stay for your money. We had a little flat screen tv which did have a CNN Europe channel in English. The bathroom was nice sized but the shower was kinda little. It was a nice surprise to find in the bathroom an outlet that would take a 110 v without a converter/adapter. The room has a little frig stocked with drinks, but we found a little grocery store by the water taxis and bought some drinks and snacks to keep in our room. We did use the computer for 5 euros for 30 minutes, but the computer was slow compared to what we were used to and did lock up on us. But it was really just to do a quick check for something, we were so busy in Venice that the computer wasn't really a concern.

This sihgns you could see everywhere and the last two always will show the way to the hotel Olimpia. Especcially at the night time! You have to know - the orientiering even with the map is very difficult, because you can not see all the bridges on it and all the time you reach the water at the end of the streets! And the third reason is the hotel personal. There works one guy Mirco. He speaks english, spanish, french, german and russian. By the way, he is very well educated person and pays a lot attention to all your demands - that happends in Italy very very seldom! The director is a very kind and friendly person as well.

It mostly came from the bathroom and I literally had to hold my breath or even spray perfume to mask it before I went in there cause it was not pleasant and it was so over bearing. U could smell it around the hotel and it was just too strong. The breakfast was fantastic--fresh fruit, cereals, eggs, cappincino, brie cheese, ham, croissants, nutella, cream cheese etc (the best we had in rome compared to our other hotels). We were able to easily get a water taxi near by and go to the main sites such as the rialto bridge and st marks square.
