Also, it was important for us that the area was safe, as we were two young girls and I can only say that we always felt safe and were never afraid to walk around in this zone by ourselves (not even during the night)! The room was rather big (especially the bathroom) and very clean! Prices are very cheap (especially for a city like Paris), but breakfast was not included. (Still, it was not too expensive to eat at the hotel and the breakfast buffet was great!) I only had the impression that the staff was a bit cold and distant, but maybe it only felt like that because they didn\u00b4t speak any other language properly apart from French (which sadly neither of us was( is able to speak), but all in all it was ok, because when we really needed an important information the were always able to help us!

We asked for extra pillows and towels and they brought them to our room straight away. . We had dinner in the Ristorante Amalf (located just outside the hotel). The Pizza was lovely, but avoid the Spaghetti Bolognaise. We literally had a tablespoon amount of mince on watery spaghetti.", "Date": "February 16, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "4", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Eastern States", "Title": "\u201cA Very French, Cute Little Hotel\u201d", "Author": "DaffodilSparkle", "ReviewID": "UR12211462", "Content": "This was the first hotel we stayed in on our trip to France, and we were welcomed and pleased. It has nice curb appeal, a sweet little elevator, and a winding spiral staircase upward if you care to get the excersize. It was quaintly decorated while still carrying all the modern neccessities. Our room was clean and convienently held a microwave. There were windows as well, overlooking a pleasabt courtyard backed up to apartments- it was fun to see locals do their normal activities- we saw a lady hanging laundry and someone cooking dinner. Breakfast the next morning was delicious- they had hot chocolate, real croissants, eggs, biscuits, and (my favorite) little glas jam jars that we kept and brought back as souvineirs. We had a lovelty trip, beginning with Lux Hotel Picpus- it was also close to great sightseeing.", "Date": "January 1, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Washington DC, District of Columbia", "Title": "\u201cGood value!\u201d", "Author": "blondedawn", "ReviewID": "UR10001758", "Content": "Overall, we liked this hotel a lot. Front desk staff was very friendly. Room was clean, and comparatively spacious to other rooms we had had in Europe. Breakfast was tasty -- they serve actual croissants (among other things) from a boulangerie as opposed to prepackaged croissants like other hotels I have visited. And, of course, the price was right! It was very easy to reach the sights of Paris using the Nation or Picpus metro stops -- the subway lines serve the Louvre, Arc de Triomphe, and the Eiffel Tower directly. If you don't mind having to ride the subway for 10-15 minutes, this is a great value -- much cheaper than the accomodations more central in town. We also liked the area around the hotel. A *bunch* of boulangeries, where you can stop to get some bread or a pastry as an evening snack; a supermarket right at Nation; lots of brasseries.

This is a typical small (39 room) Paris hotel in the 11th arrondisement near Place de la Nation. Each time my room was small but extremely clean, tidy and comfortable - with a comfortable double bed, small desk and chair, closet, 13\" TV (5 channels, all French), and bathroom. The small room (48 euro)was fine for me, but couples may want to get a bigger (57 euro) room. You are required to take breakfast (7 euro), but it is a good spread with croissants, baguettes, cold cuts, fruit, yogurt, cereal, coffee and juice. The hotel is on a quiet, safe residential street just south of Place de la Nation. While the Picpus metro stop is right nearby, you are better off walking 5 minutes to the Nation metro / RER station - the 1 line is the nicest metro line in Paris and runs right down the Right Bank to Notre Dame, Louvre, Arc de Triomphe, etc. The staff is friendly, and there is 24 hr front desk staffing. You can not find a cheaper clean, safe hotel room in Paris - but be aware that this is not the Ritz.", "Date": "May 16, 2007"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Lux Hotel Picpus", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g187147-d554230-Reviews-Lux_Hotel_Picpus-Paris_Ile_de_France.html", "Price": "$77 - $111*", "Address": "<address> <span rel=\"v:address\"> <span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">74, boulevard de Picpus</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:postal-code\">75012</span> <span property=\"v:locality\">Paris</span></span>, <span class=\"country-name\" property=\"v:country-name\">France</span> </span> </span> </address>", "HotelID": "554230", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/02/46/96/15/lux-hotel-picpus.jpg"}}
