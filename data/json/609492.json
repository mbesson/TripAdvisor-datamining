{"Reviews": [{"Content": "Stay away from this property! We stayed in Soggiorno Burchi for two nights and were supposed to pay EUR 70 per night but were able to negotiate this down to EUR 55 at the end of our stay due to the inadequate facilities and service provided. I would not recommend anyone to stay at this BB since there are certainly other, better places to stay in Florence in this price range. First of all, this BB is dark and noisy and the rooms (although moderately clean) are not well maintained. Second, the bathroom where we stayed during our first night did have a shower head but no cabin or anything so I had to take a shower above the toilet. After threatening to leave, we got another room with a proper shower cabin. However, water pressure was very low so taking a shower was a real hassle. Finally, please note that Soggiorno Burchi and Soggiorno Livi are essentially the same BB, being located in the same building and managed by the same people.", "Date": "Oct 23, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR453282090", "Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "2", "Check in / front desk": "2", "Overall": "1", "Value": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "worldtraveler12345"}, {"Content": "\"....O ye who enter here leave hope behind\" Probably Dante's was guest of Soggiorno Burchi when wrote Divine Comedy's Inferno....An ants army welcoming you in the bathroom and room was cleaned last time by Leonardo Da Vinci: dust is everywhere!!!

I arrived in this horrible hotel with a friend. We were given a room for two. Anyway there wasn't any tv or phone in the room as promissed. Then on the floor I noticed that there were thousands of black hairs...... argh... not mine (I'm blond and my friend as well). Then in the bathroom : the shower was broken, the toilet seat as well, and when one flushed the toilet, well....guess what ?...well it'd start raining. I mean...what kind of hotel is this ?? Then....oh it's not finished... then at about 8 am every day you'd hear people screaming in italian (it seams italian people speak very loud....)...those people were of course the hotel proprietors.... I mean not even a good night's sleep is possible in that [--] . Last but not least the proprietors weren't nice at all. So I advice you to avoid this hotel. Believe me ! And I could continue criticising this hotel.....", "Date": "Aug 28, 2006", "ReviewID": "UR650556231", "Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Business service": "1", "Cleanliness": "1", "Check in / front desk": "1", "Overall": "1", "Value": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "2"}, "Author": "Evitah"}, {"Content": "Only if you have nowhere else... How they got the photos for the web site is a mystery! They are totally deceptive. You might think 70 Euros and being very near the central train station of Santa Maria Novella is a real deal -- but unless you really have no other choice, give it a pass. In reality the rooms were like a bad movie of a 1950's flophouse... One lamp actually was held together by scotch tape! The old linens were clean, as was the teeny bathroom and shower. However, the next door neighbors were also something out of a bad Mafia movie. The TV was on full blast till 3 am, and by the kinds of voices and looks we got, I didn't dare ask them to turn it off. The signora was very nice on the phone when we booked, and she promised us the usual Italian pensione breakfast for the price of 10 Euros more... However, her husband was none too pleased to have to provide breakfast. He brought us some ok coffee, but nasty rolls, with colored water for juice. (This is Italy! At least the brioche could be fresh!)It was also a true fire trap -- bars on the 4th and 5th floor windows, and barely an exit clear. I have almost never in my long life of traveling Europe and North America been so glad to get away from a B  B, motel or hotel. My children will be teasing me about that night in Florence for a long time.", "Date": "Apr 29, 2006", "ReviewID": "UR546350663", "Ratings": {"Service": "-1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "-1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "1", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "-1", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "TravellingColoradans"}, {"Content": "Mastro lindo   showReview(21559569, 'full');", "Date": "Nov 5, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR574185939", "Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "1", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "SIGNORTONINO"}, {"Content": "Bed    showReview(21526835, 'full');", "Date": "Nov 4, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR873292656", "Ratings": {"Service": "-1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "1", "Value": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "LorenzoSardegna"}, {"Content": "Bonjour, Chambre single avec...   showReview(20743916, 'full');", "Date": "Sep 22, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR771507849", "Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "2", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "lass="}, {"Content": "Purtroppo i miei giudizi sulla...   showReview(17740237, 'full');", "Date": "Jun 10, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR116193996", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "4", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "lass="}], "HotelInfo": {"HotelURL": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g187895-d609492-r10268265-Soggiorno_Burchi-Florence_Tuscany.html", "HotelID": "609492", "Price": "$90"}}
