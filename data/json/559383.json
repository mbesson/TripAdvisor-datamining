The manager must have moved the parking ticket first thing in the morning, before we found it and complained to him about getting the ticket in the first place. If we had known about the ticket then, it would have been like $30.00....but since we didn't pay it on time, it was close to $150.00. BEWARE OF THIS HOTEL< AND THIS MANAGER!!!!

At our time of arrival we found that the management was very rude. We were told by the management that extra pillows were $5.00 extra a pillow. The rooms were very dirty and the sheets and towels were stained. The bathroom had mold around the ceiling and around the bathtub/shower. The walls are very thin so be aware that if you have children this is not a very good hotel. The floor of the rooms were very dirty with food and what looked like sawdust around the edges. Our reservation was for 3 nights. We stayed one and packed up and found another hotel.

Ultimately, you get what you pay for, meaning if you're expecting the Ritz Carlton -- or hell, even Motel 6 -- you'll bound to be sorely disappointed. For what it's worth, though, it was clean when I stayed there, and I didn't spy any roaches -- and didn't return with any bedbugs. Oh, and that thing that the guy wrote about the strong curry smell eminating from the check-in area -- that was completely valid. Also, there's a plethora of urban grit for those that appreciate such a thing. Plenty of, um, characters, for lack of a better term (read: homeless people that screamed at themselves late at night while I was trying to sleep) populate the surrounding neighborhood. The neighborhood itself is primarily Armenian and Thai. That in mind, there's no shortage of ethnic cuisine within walking distance. On the plus side, the hotel is only a $15 ride from LAX if you book a red van shuttle. Also, it's located just a stone's throw away from the heart of Hollywood (Hollywood and Highland), which you can reach via subway for $1 each way (a subway station is located five or six blocks away from the hotel). For those that prefer to travel by taxi: I paid $20 to go from the hotel to Barney's Beanary on Santa Monica Boulevard (blocks away from the Rainbow and Roxy on Sunset Blvd). Hope this helps.

The neighborhood is to put it mildly \"scary\". We were asked to give a $10. deposit for the tv remote; therefore, everytime we went out we took the remote with us to avoid \"losing\" it. We asked for Kleenex and were given an extra roll of toilet paper. There are no towel bars, lamps, or clock radios; in fact, nothing that the \"clientele\" can \"mistakenly\" take with them when they flee in the middle of the night. It was difficult to find another hotel in L.A. in the middle of the tourist season; but even though we had a nonrefundable prepay; we called and called until we found somewhere else and checked out. It was well worth paying twice to escape. On the positive side, the place is very clean and what is in the rooms is not shabby or worn; so if you can live with the other conditions, then it's probably a good deal.", "Date": "July 30, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "2", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Service": "1", "Rooms": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Redwood Shores", "Title": "\u201cA small motel rather than a hotel category\u201d", "Author": "h2r1v7", "ReviewID": "UR3905485", "Content": "Hollywood Inn Express North has less than 20 rooms. It's pretty much motel6 style with a small front desk office opened 24/7. I could smell Indian curry at the front desk office as soon as I came in. There's only 1 receptionist at the reception who has actually lived and worked there. He spoke to me while eating Indian food. He might have camera to monitor the motel in and out since I was told exactly who was with me in my room. It made me feel uncomfortable. Followings are pros and cons from this motel. Pros: clean room, free outdoor parking, small refrigerator in the room making it different than motels, good and cheap Thai food rigth across the street, the homeless people around seemed to be peaceful and the area didn't seem to be unsafe. Cons: everything was rundown, the hair dryer didn't work properly, the refrigerator and the AC made noise, the curtain could not be closed properly when the AC was on, the refrigerator took a whole night to cool a beer, no internet service in the room while free internet service was mentioned in the ad. The front desk smelled Indian food. The free breakfast at the front desk was served only from 7:30AM to 8:30AM and the receptionist rushed in as soon as possible to wrap everything up for himself. The room price was high for this kind of motel in this area - 2 nites for $200 with tax included. Learning from this bad experience I would rather live in Motel6 next time for half price.

Had we paid $50 or $60-something I would rate this motel as a 4 or a 5, in terms of value. I was more than a little worried about what our room might be like, but really we just needed a place to crash and were only there to explore Hollywood for the night and see the \"local scenery.\" I've stayed at plenty of nice places in my day, but actually enjoy experiencing the other side of life once in awhile. We found our room (#125) to be surprisingly clean. (I brought my own pillow and blanket just in case, but ended up not even needing them.) The sheets were very soft and the bed was comfortable. The room had a new refrigerator, which was a nice touch. Otherwise I would say the room was very comparable to your average Motel 6. We didn't use the pool, but it looked very clean, as did the outside of the motel. It appears that it was freshly painted and we noticed that the grounds were free of trash or debris. Of course this being Hollywood there were a few questionable looking characters walking around, but certainly that's to be expected. We walked back to our room at 2am after barhopping and never felt unsafe. However, I would not roam this area alone, especially if you are female. The only cockroach we saw was on the sidewalk, further down on Hollywood Blvd. and NOT at the motel itself(!) Last but not least, make sure to go across the street to Jumbo's Clown Room. This is a great little dive bar and we met a couple of fun people here, including the bartender from Germany who recommended the ~great~ Thai food place across the street (Vim). We had a wonderful meal there - soup, appetizer, 2 entrees and 4 beers for $35. The Hollywood Inn Express is located in \"Thai Town\" so you will probably find great Thai food anywhere in the area.
