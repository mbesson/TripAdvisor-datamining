So, all the highly rated accommodation options in Venice were sold out by then. Minerva & Nettuno was the decent of the left over lot. We were a bit apprehensive about this place. But, we were proven wrong. It was basic, decent, clean and moderately priced. It is 5 minutes walk from Piazzale Roma & Ferrovia. You might miss the sign board, if you don't pay enough attention. Check-in: It was smooth. Had no issues. They insisted on cash. Did not accept cards. Only the front desk guy spoke English. It was a bit tough to communicate with others. Had to seek the help of front desk guy to others help. Room: Rooms were a bit hot & Humid. And stinked a bit at first. It was fine after switching on the AC. Latch in the bathroom door was missing. Yeah, and the water in taps was warm at best. Hotel needs urgent attention on small things like this. Otheriwse, its a basic, decent and clean place. Has no lifts.

We pulled the massive curtains back to reveal a window at ceiling height the size of a shoe box!! The room was hot and humid and smelt bad too. There was a broken plug with mosquito repellant on the scruffy table god knows what wouldve hapoened in the night, probably eaten alive.

The room was a good size with nets on the windows to keep the mozzies out and was cleaned everyday. The bathroom was shared between 3 rooms but there was never a queue or a problem or lack of hot water when you needed a shower, it was also cleaned everyday. Reception was fine, they were decent enough, we asked for a fan when it got too hot and they let us have it in the room for a week for free. The hotel has some great links to the main Vaparetto stops, we'd recommend getting yourself a travelcard from the main kiosk in front of the train station, we found it really handy when exploring the far out Islands of Venice, certainly recommend some of the farm Islands, they're beautiful. Get yourself to F'Nova and check the stops from there. Take note, there's a Supermarket down the road towards Campo Sofia so don't be tempted to spend 3Euro on a bottle of water, you get the exact same bottle for 17c in the supermarket.

When you come to Venice, you must be deeply attracted to the city of Water and Bridges.

It's close to the train station and water station, so that is convenient and economical to backpackers, and even better is that there are breakfast !

It's small, cheap and the people are nice. The location is very good: because it's only a one minute walk from the train station Santa Lucia (the only train station in Venice). Everything in Venice is old, the hotel was build around the year 1400. Service There is somebody at the reception 24 hours a day. They speak English and are very kind. A lady booked a tour for us by phone, for example. Breakfast The hotel is small. There is a reception, a small breakfast area and the rooms. There are about six or seven tables. The breakfast is basic: one 'panino' for everybody. There is yogurt, marmalade, cheese, meat, coffee, milk, juice and tea. Room We had room number 25. Complete with bathroom with sink, toilet and shower, an extra sink, a television, air conditioning, a table and two chairs. And a bed,of course! A very charming, typical Italian room. It has a view over main street 'Rio tera lista di spagna', so it was a bit noisy. We didn't hear the neighbors though. Location The hotel is located in Cannaregio, one of the six districts of Venice. Venice is small, so everything is close to the center. In front of the train station (so: very close to the hotel) there is a boat stop, called Ferrovia. The boats are called vaporetti and work like the underground, but then on the water, of course! You can buy tickets for a few days at the stop Ferrovia. I would advise that. The neighborhood is nice, lots of restaurants and shops around. Value We paid 45 euro's per person per night. Very cheap in Venice! Including breakfast. We booked via a travel agency in Holland. Cleanliness Spotless and clean! Housekeeping came every morning. Good to know Not all the rooms have an own bathroom. Rooms without are cheaper, but if you like your own, you can ask for it when you make your reservation. Another tip: take earplugs. My boyfriend didn't need them, but I was glad I had them. It's not very noisy, but a little. How to get there From train station Santa Lucia: step outside, enjoy the view and take a left. It's about a one minute walk. The hotel is on the left of the street. It's small, so pay attention. When you reach a small square named Geremia, you are too far. From boat stop Ferrovia: take a right. It's about a one minute walk. The hotel is on the left of the street. It's small, so pay attention. When you reach a small square named Geremia, you are too far. If you are looking for a nice place to sleep and have breakfast, Minerva e Nettuno is very good.

Here are some positive and negative aspects we experienced in this hotel: Positive: - Cheap: We paid \u00e2\u201a\u00ac 25 pppn for a double room with shared bathroom: the cheapest we could find in the center of Venice. - Location! It is 5 minutes walking from the Santa Lucia train station and from the bus boat stop. You can easily visit Venice by foot from here. In the street of the hotel are many restaurants and shops. - Quiet: the most of the rooms are at the back side. We had a small but nice room at the back side, with a (shared) balcony, so there was no noise from the street. Only you could hear what happened in the hallway, but apart of a cleaning women's conversation one morning (rather late), it didn't bother us. - Friendly: the receptionist that welcomed us was friendly and spoke English very well. He recommended us some cheap restaurants* in the street of the hotel. The other was less nice, but we didn't have any problems. - Breakfast is included. However, everything was the cheapest they could find, and you get only one little bread (but they gave us another when we asked for it), for the rest you have to eat muesli, yoghurt, fruit salad and zwieback. Negative: - Though the beds were comfortable, the pillows were very hard and with lumps. The \"double bed\" consisted in two single beds put together, so there was a hard border in the middle. - There didn't come a lot of water out of the (shared) shower. - The first night, our room was very warm because the heating was turned on and the button to turn it off was broken. We had to leave the window opened all the time, which let enter mosquitos. The next day, they had 'repaired' it by turning off the heating. Fortunately, we were not too cold later, because the button was still not repaired, so we couldn't turn it on again. Overall, the negative aspects were just details that didn't bother us a lot. For this price, it's a really good place to stay in Venice. * If you are staying in this hotel and looking for cheap food, try the restaurant AeOche, just at the same side of the street, going towards the station. They have delicious and big take away pizzas for \u00e2\u201a\u00ac 6,50. If you eat inside, they charge you service costs, like in most restaurants in Venice. The receptionist also recommended us the Brek's restaurant, also in the same street. Don't go there. Yes it was the cheapest, but you will need two dishes to not be hungry anymore and the quality was very bad.", "Date": "April 20, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "San Francisco, California", "Title": "\u201cClose to train station\u201d", "Author": "bendybunny", "ReviewID": "UR26216430", "Content": "We enjoyed staying in this small, clean and affordabel hotel.

This was a first holiday toegther since our wedding this summer (the honeymoon is next month) and I was a bit fearful as i realised Venice is very expensive and my wallet is not huge. The wife helpded by saying \"I'd rather spend on clothes so keep costs down\". Having reviewed several sites, I found Hotel Minerva one of the cheapest available with sound reviews. Having arrived with several suitcases and just stopped off for food, we were expecting a long journey to find this hotel. So when we were told that it was just over the bridge from where the airport bus had dropped us off, we go off to a great start to say the least. The location for me cannot be better. It is close to the train station and bus station which enter Venice, but also has the feel of really being in Venice. There are plenty of shops and (fairly reasonable) restaurants around the vacinity. The room - as i went for the cheapest, we had to share a bathroom on the 2nd floor - i knew this in advance. This was fine with me, and even the wife wasn't too bothered (eventually!)- yes an en-suite would have been better - which are available, but we wanted to keep it cheap. Speaking of which, i dont think you can find a cheaper place. I shoud state value for money becuase chaep can give the image of tacky and poor quality - but this was not the case. Anyway, this place is certainly the best priced around. The room was fine - spacious, clean and we had a great view looking down on the busy street. Quality - reviews had mentioned breakfast was not great. So i didn't bother getting up for it. The wfie did go on the last monring - she thouroughly enjoyed it. It was simple but effective and was worth getting up for...thankfully, she brought me up some breakfast in bed which was great. (So pls be aware of reviews...i will discuss a little further soon. ) Service - the people were all fantasttic - very helpful and reccomended some good places- we did try and speak Italian to them as i believe this can go a long way. i had head Venice was not too good on service but we tried to speak italian, smiled all the time and everyone were fantastic. Problem Solving - on chceking out, I was asked to pay the sum (which i believ ei had paid on reservation). The owner dealt with me very professionaly and effectivly, allowing me to call, use internet and pretty much sit on his desk to look into this. my e-mail confimred that he was right and that i had not paid. So he did indeed handle me very well. We started talking and i mentioned i would give a good and honest review - he did not like the words interent and review... explaining that when people do complain and write negative reveiws, there is no facility/option for him to put his side of the story. I guess he is right. So overall i do recommend this place - BUT please do take my 2 pieces of advice: 1. Manage expectations - i expected very little and was delighted. So do not expect the Hilton following reading my reveiw! It is very good value for money and ideally located - if you want a room just to sleep in, this is the one. If you want spa, food, wine and stay in hotel, there may be other ones more suited for this. 2, I think it helps being positve, smiling and trying to speak the local language - a little efforrt can go a long way. P.s Apologies for poor spelling....very busy at work! P.p.S - found a great take-out Pizza place around the corner from this hotel - head towards St Marks square and around the corner, over the bridge and on the right you will find the pizza place - it is by some fruit market stalls and close to a (BLODDY EXPENSIVE) internet cafe.", "Date": "October 22, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "1", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Manchester", "Title": "\u201cGood budget hotel\u201d", "Author": "jessybobs", "ReviewID": "UR20354169", "Content": "Stayed at the Minerva for 2 nights, I picked the hotel mainly because of the price and the location,, near to the station and Piazzale Roma. When i first arrived I thought \" My Gosh what have I come to \" The receptionist seemed very abrupt and had a gang of friends around her laughing and joking. She hardly took any notice of me. My room was on the 3rd floor, no lift, the carpet on the stairs needed a good hoovering and the metal carpet rods needed screwing down properly, could be dangerous. I was dreading opening the door, but to my suprise the room was large, bright and clean, very minimal with 70's style bedroom furniture. But I got to love that room, especially the view onto the street and the San Geremia church, with its beautiful bells, and the view over the Venetian rooftops. Yes it was noisy but the double glazing cancelled that out, it went quiet after 12am anyway. No problem with mosquitos, there was a repellant plug in the room with tablets, but I also brought my own. The shared toilet on the 3rd floor was a bit tatty, not unclean but patches of bare plaster and cement. I tended to use the 2nd floor toilet as it was nicer. The showers were clean and hot. Can't comment on breakfast as it was not included in my rate, but I bought pasries and yoghurt in the numerous bakeries around Lista di Spagna ( I also took my own Kettle and coffee) There was no safe in the room, which worried me I asked reception to keep my passport, but it was just shoved in a drawer with an elastic band around it, so next day I got it back and just kept it with me. Cleaning staff were thorough and pleasant. I would stay again at the Minerva, if on a limited budget, it was not as bad as my 1st impression. On a previous trip in June I stayed in a 4 star on the Lido, so may have been a little spoilt by that. But would chose the Minerva for the location, I loved the Lista di Spagna. I think I will be a regular visitor to Venice and the Minerva will do me fine, rather than not go at all.

It was a reasonable price and had a great location for us. It's close to the train station and Piazzale Roma (where you leave by bus or to get to the airports), which was great as we didn't have to travel far with our luggage. Also, it's really close to the Grand Canal. The area is very touristy, though, and the street outside our window stayed busy and loud until very late at night. We are incredibly heavy sleepers, so didn't not have much of a problem, but if you are a light sleeper, a room facing this street is not for you. Speaking of windows, we had to have them open all night because there's no air conditioning and our room was on the 4th floor. In June, Venice was incredibly hot. Somehow, at night, the room was substantially hotter than the street below -- about 90 degrees in the room for most of the night. And, there were mosquitoes because the window didn't have a screen. Since it really wasn't too bad outside at night, we think that if the room had just had a fan, it would've been a lot more comfortable. But, as it was, it was pretty tough to sleep being so hot. The room was pretty clean and had a sink in it which was nice. The shared bathroom, however, was pretty nasty. It seemed really old and had some mold in it. The last day we were there, the shower was full of sand and hair and was hardly draining. Gross! If you can afford somewhere else in Venice, do it. But, if not, this was not a terrible stay -- just be prepared for some heat and bring shower shoes! We had found a hotel on Lido (Hotel Belvedere), which did not seem too expensive but the reviews listed it as far from Venice. It's only about 15 min by boat from Piazza di San Marco and you're on a boat the whole way, so it's really not that bad. If we go back to Venice, we'll probably stay on Lido because it really isn't far and seemed much nicer. Plus, Lido was beautiful!

The room was somewhat poorly lit (nothing like what appears on the Expedia room photos), but relatively well kept. The bed was not the best I've slept on but for the day-weary, it was good enough. Breakfast was in a pleasant sunroom type area and was perfunctory but not unwelcome. A humble mix of basic Italian and English allowed communication with the front desk during my stay. The staff person was very accomodating the next day as I wanted to explore the city in the morning and afternoon while leaving my bags for check in at a tour-booked hotel the following night.
