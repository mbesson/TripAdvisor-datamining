We booked four rooms in total and everyone had a good time. I personally prefer hotels with boutique-feel; less rooms/suites and more personalized service. I got to admit that the level of service's impeccable. Check in was a breeze. Despite our early arrivals, they managed to accommodate two rooms for early check in which we're grateful for. For a business hotel, the guest service at the reception were excellent; warm, friendly and personal. For frequent travelers, to have a personalized service regardless the number of rooms or if its business or leisure, is crucial as we spent a number of days dining and utilizing services at the hotel. Spacious lobby and grand staircase, with a well-kept 90's feel. Had cocktails at Champagne Bar, a cozy watering hole with exquisite Art Deco architecture and interior. Had coffee and breakfast at Grand Cafe. Service was a little bit slow, but to be expected in a hotel at this scale. Love the free form swimming pool with dedicated lane for you to do your laps. The gym's spacious with enough workout machines. The only downside of our stay was unfortunately the room. The hallway's too tight that two persons could barely fit side-by-side against the bathroom door and the closet. Other than that, great stay. Love the location, we walked everywhere (pretty nice and breezy in the winter months)", "Date": "September 2, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "4.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Nha Trang, Vietnam", "Title": "\u201cExcellent front line staff, good business ambience\u201d", "Author": "go_or_no_go", "ReviewID": "UR138737474", "Content": "Stayed only for one night and found that the Grand brand has not lost its touch if not improved. I used to complain about how cold and procedural most of the front line staff of HK are but my stay changed my perspective. You can imagine that I have been travelling to HK for more than 10 years now so this notion is not easily undoable until my stay. The check in process was fast, efficient but surprisingly warm as is every approach I make with the front line team considering how busy they were. F&B needs a bit more attention though this is usually the case for large hotels with multiple food and bev outlets. A few areas tend to be overlooked. The facilities and the room were great but there is nothing less to be expected of a Grand Hyatt so I can simply say all is well in these areas. We were interrupted for an hour and a half by our \"busy\" neighbors but I guess no sound proofing is ready for the amount of noise they were making so I can't really blame that on the hotel.

Repeat guests are key to any hotel's success and indeed ensuring that guests have a pleasant and comfortable stay with value for money must be the objective of any hotel chain. Hyatt is my favourite chain and provides a level of service that is well known, consistent, easy to understand and book and value for money. In addition with their points programs, you have a good chance of getting a free stay next time especially as they have periods of the year when they give extra points to encourage you to stay. The Grand Hyatt Hotel Wanchai is very well situated next to the convention centre and within 5 min from Central by the hotel's London taxi. It's even closer to the airport express terminal now because of the new road that runs directly from the terminal to the hotel along the reclaimed land next to the new Hong Kong government building. Its easy to connect with any part of Hong Kong, through an easy covered walking distance to the Wan chai MTR train station. The property has avey pleasant location and and outlook over the harbour. Most of the rooms have harbour views over the convention centre and are well laid out with excellent facilities. It's the people who make a hotel and of course there are too many to mention. The important ones are of course Jeff the manager of the Bell desk, Jake and Scott in the Grand Club lounge. Yorky the speedy bellboy, Grace who answers the phone and Karen who answers the room service phone. Winnie, Fred and Gordon are the management and it is to their credit that the hotel is so well run. So what do I recommend? Ensure you have a Harborview room but of course that's to be expected, because a high percentage of the rooms do have a Harborview. Pay to upgrade to the Grand Club lounge and enjoy the excellent breakfast, with harbour views, the all day wine service, and the excellent cocktails in the evening. From 530pm till 730pm everyday the cocktails are tremendous and get there early to grab a first-class seat by the window. Try the spa, the Grand Cafe, ride in the London taxi to Central and at the same time just enjoy the five-star luxury located conveniently next to the convention centre. Don't forget that the Australian embassy is 10 minutes walk away, the Immigration Department and Tax department are just across the road in Wan Chai Take my advice, stay there and enjoy the ambiance.

I stayed here twice last year and was going to again last month, although had to cancel due to last-minute change in my schedule. Every stay was near perfect and overall this is a fantastic hotel with a great Club lounge and outstanding service. Check-in was always efficiently done and as a Diamond member with Hyatt Gold Passport program, I would always be escorted up to my room. The staff also carefully went through the benefits I was entitled to as a Diamond member. These little touches did make me feel like they really valued my business. I was always allocated a room on the Club floor although never upgraded to harbor view room. I didn't find a harbor view room necessary as the view from the Kowloon side was miles better anyway. The top 8 floors of the hotel were designated as Club floors. The room was fairly small and looked and felt dated, but it was spotlessly clean and everything worked. I didn't like the bathroom though, it felt very 90s, and the garish gold plated tap and fixtures were vomit-inducing. The Grand Club lounge was very grand and had expansive view of the harbor. The atmosphere felt a bit stuffy at times and I felt like I had to be prim and proper and be in my best behavior at all times. That said, the service was exemplary. Although not the friendliest bunch, the wait staff was very efficient and after the first visit, they would remember my drinks of choice, how I take your coffee, etc. and brought these the next time I visit the lounge, without even being asked. Again, the service here was truly impeccable, it seemed that the staff could anticipate my needs even before me. Food selection during service hours was extensive and alcohol was available all day, although they did save the best stuff for the cocktail hours. This was truly the best Club lounge experience I had. Although, perhaps, the problem with it being so awesome is that guests tend to linger in the lounge, so it could get very crowded indeed. One evening, there was a line to get tables and guests ended up sharing tables with other guests, and the staff was literally running around the lounge. Not something that I expected in a property that was priced as high as this. I found the Club Concierges tended to be a bit aloof though. Unlike their colleagues at the other Hyatt across the harbor who is always beaming with smiles and saying \"Good Morning, etc\" whenever I enter the lounge, the Club Concierges here didn't even look up from their computer screen whenever a guest entered the lounge. In fairness, when I approached them, they were polite and not rude. Location-wise, there was little to see and do around the hotel. But the Wan Chai MTR station was an easy 7-10 minutes walk from the hotel via a covered footbridge. From here, I could easily get anywhere in Hong Kong. Overall, this is a fantastic property with a great Club lounge and outstanding service. Although the interior and the overall feel of the hotel is not to my liking, I probably would have made this my home in Hong Kong, if not because of the very expensive price tag.", "Date": "June 1, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Hong Kong, China", "Title": "\u201cThe Grand Dame\u201d", "Author": "Gris M", "ReviewID": "UR131106268", "Content": "I've stayed at The Grand Hyatt at least once a year.

Good Chinese restaurant. Helpful concierge. Sadly there are more negatives that positives: The location is poor unless you are going to the exhibition centre - cut off and nothing to walk directly to and quickly to from the hotel. And it is very busy when there are exhibitions so taxis are not always ideal from this location. Hotel rooms noisy - it seems you can hear the bathroom above whenever the shower is used. On my second stay in a fortnight I was allocated a room with an adjoining door when I had specifically requested a quiet room (and I had been moved on my previous stay just over a week before because of noise from above) - it was really noisy with the paper thin adjoining door and I had to move. They upgraded me which was nice, and gave me a complimentary bottle of wine which was also a nice touch. But I did spend an hour moving room and even when I had moved the building site opposite was also quite noisy and this is just across from the hotel and they work long hours. And I had the noise from the bathroom again - clearly just a problem with the hotel. The hotel being next to the conference centre seems very impersonal - large public spaces and not in my opinion a great place to be staying on your own on business, partly because of the location.

Knowing nothing of Hong Kong and having no patience for finding that perfect little Chinese owned hotel, I opted for the Grand Hyatt on Victoria Harbour. As soon as the bellman opened the door, I knew I had made the right decision. The room just oozed pampering...the view of the Harbour was never ending, the crisp white bed looked like it was made to rest my tired soul, as well as body, the simple Asian design helped calm my cluttered mind. The bathroom was exquisite, with a deep tub and shower. I found myself only taking baths, the tub was so wonderful. Of course, I got out of each bath and into the thick terry robe and slippers provided for me. I really did not even want to leave the room, but did. I saw Kowloon and road the trolley in the old shoreline area of Hong Kong, snapping pictures without having to exert the energy I did not have. Each time, I could take the public transportation back to my stop and walk the short blocks through the winding walkways between buildings, which is so typical of Hong Kong high rises, to the entrance of my hotel. Each time I was graced by outside staff who greeted me with professional friendliness and kindness. I could walk into the gorgeous lobby and enjoy just the beautiful design that was my living room for my short stay. But it was wonderful to also have jazz playing on the mezzanine, welcoming me with a relaxing ambiance. One evening I stopped and sat for a time listening to the great pianist and four-part combo. If I had not been so tired, I would have ordered a drink and appetizer and settled in for the night.. It is expensive, but for a short stay it is well worth the money as you are assured to see much of what you wish, water or city, right from your hotel window. If you are ready to partake in the excitement that is special to Hong Kong, then select the city-side of the hotel. If you are more inclined to need rest, as I was, then the Harbour side is perfect. Waking to the boats and ships beginning to move across the water and resting with the hues of sunset still touching the seascape, was a great treat. I also got a fruit plate each day, which was the perfect ending for my busy couple of days in the two cities. With bottled water provided, I did not even need to grace the bar.

Hotel is located directly on Victoria Harbor next to the convention center. It\u2019s a good location if you\u2019re attending a function at the convention center or catching the ferry to Kowloon (the Star ferry dock is less than a ten minute walk). But you\u2019ll need to take a cab or the MTR (Hong Kong\u2019s subway), if you want to go to the central district which is where most of the action is. Maybe I was expecting more since this is supposed to be the Grand Hyatt\u2019s flagship property. That\u2019s not to say that it wasn\u2019t very nice, it was. But it wasn\u2019t any different than any other Grand Hyatt property I\u2019ve been to. I was in a standard king room but I was upgraded to a harbor view at no charge. Perhaps because I have Platinum status in Hyatt\u2019s Gold Passport program or just because of the fact that I asked. The room was average size to perhaps a bit on the small size but this is Asia after all and space is at a premium. Rooms are furnished with a modern wood d\u00e9cor which gives them a \u201cboutique\u201d hotel look. The bathrooms are marble with gold fixtures which is a bit odd. It looks as though they may have remodeled the rooms but left the bathrooms in their original state. The hotel does have a very nice rooftop pool with a tropical feel. There\u2019s a pool bar and restaurant that reminded me more of a resort setting than a city business hotel. There is a spa and exercise room that\u2019s nicely equipped with all of the modern equipment you\u2019d expect to find in a five star hotel. There are several restaurants located in the hotel but with so many dining options available in Hong Kong I never had the chance to eat in the hotel. While the cab ride from the airport will set you back approx. $60-$70 (US), cabs to just about anywhere in the city are extremely inexpensive. I almost felt bad being charged what amounted to $2-$3 for a 10-15 minutes cab ride. Any city in the states would cost five times or more. I opted for the hotel bus from the airport to the hotel which costs $19 (US) each way. On my trip into the city I was the only one on the bus. It takes around 45 minutes with no traffic. You can take the MTR Airport Express which gets you from the airport to central station in 22 minutes for $8 (US). The problem is you\u2019ll have to transfer to another line (which is then another 10 minute walk to the hotel), or take a free shuttle bus that runs between central station and downtown hotels including the Hyatt. If you have anything bigger than a small suitcase this is not a very good option. There are lots of things to see and do in both Hong Kong and Kowloon but the cities are small enough that you can hit just about everything in a few days Shopping of course is a big draw but don\u2019t expect to find any bargains. Prices in the name brand stores (Gucci, Burberry, and all the other big name designers), are more expensive than you\u2019ll find at the same stores in the states even without the tax. Make sure you head over to Soho for dinner. There are some great restaurants that cater to just about every cuisine in the world. The incline train is a great way to get to the top of Victoria Peak. The views are amazing but make sure you get there early. I went up at around 9:30 AM and waited in line less than ten minutes. When I came back down the hill around noon the wait was over an hour long. In all my stay in Hong Kong while short was an interesting and enjoyable one and my stay at the Hyatt was very comfortable.

I wonder if they still have it or not... lol Anyway, this time, we have booked a Plateau Deluxe Room. (Super Pricey). The furnishing and design is AMAZING. It's modern while keeping a \"Japanese + Zen\" atmosphere. It also has a huge granite jacuzzi tub with glass window, over looking the Victoria Harbour and the flat tv screen. We are able to sleep well on the tatami-style bed. Staff and Service: The bell captain are helpful and friendly. A staff named Joanna who checked in for us on the G/F is inexpereinced on dealing guests. When I asked for late check out, she immediately rejected me without checking the room status. She was also looking at some codes on a paper and calling other staff for re-confirmation. Perhaps she is a Summer trainee? On the other hand, a staff named Kadey on 11/F is professional with great product knowledge, introducing the in-room amenties in details. Staff in Grand Club on 30/F and 31/F is super helpful and friendly too. The check in time was 14:00 but the room was not available until 15:20. They apologized by giving us a box of chocolate, an apologize card and late check out until 15:00. I was impressed by the card as it was very well-handwritten. In addition, I have to give special credits to Housekeeping and Room Service. I kept a bottle of champagne in the fridge and was planning to call Room Service after dinner for an ice bucket for chilling. When we returned the room from dinner, the bottle of champagne has already been chilled in the ice bucket and was nicely set on the table! F&B outlets: As we live in Hong kong, we have always been to the F&B outlets. I would recommend the tea or dessert buffet at Tiffins lounge for the ladies. Great dessert selection, cozy atmosphere with live Jazz music. The coffee shop is an ideal place for business lunch, high ceiling, friendly staff. The food at Kaetsu is great; but Matsubishi at Renaissance Harbour View Hotel (which is next to Grand Hyatt) is better. The food at Grissini is okay; the food overall are salty. Nicholini's at Conrad is much better. Thumb up to the buffet breakfast at Grand Club on 30/F Outdoor Swimming Pool and Spa: It's Hong Kong...one of the most densely populated areas in the world, so we couldn't expect a large swimming pool. It also gets crowded on Sunday. Massage is fine. Nice Spa room. Salon: I have been to the salon once. It belongs to the IL Colpo Group. I was shocked when they charged me (around 40 bucks!? couldnt remember the exact price) for a glass of Ice lemon tea as other salons from the same chain wouldn't charge customers. The hair stylists are professional; but the price, again, are more expensive than the other IL Colpo Salonsss. Would recommend the travelers to go to the one in Central or Causeway bay if they have time. Overall, we have a memorable experience. The Room is awesome and the staff is very well-trained.

I chose to stay here based on many good reviews & the family pool area was a big pull as we were traveling with our infant son. We were in transit on our way home to Sydney from London for 3 nights. I will try & keep this brief. We booked a \"Grand Hyatt King\" expecting something special. The first room we were given was on the 10th floor (this hotel has about 60 floors...) and when we arrived the room was not made up. We were then given another room on a much higher floor, with sincere apologies. But we wondered why we had to experience a dirty room in order to be given a room on a higher level? This hotel has about 1000 rooms. The room was small & pokey and the view was mainly of Kowloon and not much of the Harbour at all \u2013 so it was nice but not that special. Unfortunately what they wont tell you when you book this hotel - is that at the moment (july 2011) it is surrounded by major \"reclaiming harbor\" renovations. (see photos) This means that there is construction noise from 7am-7pm each day and getting in and out of the hotel is unpleasant due to stand still traffic, noise and pollution. It was a disaster. The noise traveled up to the hotel. We were jet lagged so trying to rest during the morning \u2013 it was impossible. Only after several complaints and 2 further room changes were we moved to a much higher room on the other side of the hotel - but we basically had to completely loose the plot at them in order for them to move us to the more expensive side of the hotel to escape this noise. (Which we thought we had booked but obviously not) The service was less than average, the room service was so bad and it was so expensive, and overall the hotel is one big rip off & they don't seem to care to look after western travelers. One of the rooms they tried to put us in smelt of cigarettes! We were traveling with an infant for goodness sakes! Unfortunately we struck very bad weather while we were here, it rained the whole time, so we did not get to utilize the lovely pool area once, but however, even if we wanted to the noise & dust from the construction would have made it unbearable.

I then looked around the room at the walls, desk and lay-out and quickly came to the realization that the rooms had not been remodeled at all over the past 20 years. Sure there was a new TV and new sheets etc, but for the most part the room is absolutely ancient. This is a problem that plagues many hotels in HK, so not unique to Grand Hyatt, but for $400-$500 a night, you would expect more. For instance there is only ONE plug in the whole room, clearly owning to its creation long before the advent of laptop computers. Lights are turned on and off with these weird plastic pull switches and the room just feels stale. On the positive side the bathrooms are excellent. Large, spacious and with amazing water-pressure. I am a big fan of Hyatt and usually chose to stay with them when travelling, but this hotel just isn't that great and doesn't deserve its hefty room rate. While it is nice to have a harbor view room, the location of the hotel is actually pretty far from anywhere nice. You need to take a taxi or long walk to get anywhere to have a nice bite to eat. It is also a massive, bustling lobby that has the pace and noise of a train station and detracts from the \"luxury\" feel they are going for.

In terms of public spaces, the sounds of the jazz floating through the lobby and the care that is taken in maintaining the facilities provides for a relaxing, wonderful experience. I feel like walking into the Grand Hyatt is like walking into a scene in a movie. The public spaces are so opulent as to be almost breathtaking: huge winding marble stairs and columns; absolutely enormous arrangements of fresh flowers; intuitive design \u2013 its just simply a delight to walk into this place. This just gets better as you go upstairs to discover Plateau Spa and the enormous pool and sundeck. I\u2019ve had 3 massages at Plateau this year, in all cases, highly professional and skilled masseuses putting me at complete relaxation and buffing out every knot in my back. True pleasure. In terms of dining, my absolutely favorite is Kaetsu; this is the freshest sashimi I\u2019ve experienced outside of Tokyo and the place is beautiful in design. But I can say good things about each of the other restaurants, too, and it\u2019s nice to have such a large selection inside the hotel, particularly when I\u2019m on business and may have only a short time to eat and no time to go exploring. Speaking of being on business, let me mention that I have had very good business services here including, importantly, a fast and stable internet connection from the room. I can count on working here. This is my go-to place in Hong Kong for business or pleasure, and I can highly recommend the hotel.

The swimming pool, however, leaves much room for improvement. For one, the attendants have no sense of organization in ensuring guests can be given proper attention and assistance in getting sun-chairs. They simply let the early-birds hog the chairs without thinking that maybe later on there would be other guests showing up.

(I might add that the Renaissance Harbourview which is also adjacent to the HKCEC is slightly more convenient to the convention center, but less attractive than the Hyatt.) As I was traveling for business, I had to share the room with a colleague. We were a little disappointed by the lack of space in between the super single beds, e.g., they are so close together that if she or I were snorers or tossers in our sleep, we would have had a very terrible time sleeping in the same room. However, the room was clean and well furnished, with the most attractive feature being the bathroom. A full bathtub and separate large shower, with ample sink space and lighting. You get the regular amenities that you find in 5-star hotels, especially in Asia, bathrobes, slippers, good set of toiletries, soaps, etc. One other complaint, I had a lot of trouble finding the electrical outlets, aside from the one for the hair dryer at the vanity table by the door, and one for a shaver in the bathroom, it was only until I opened the closet which houses the safe did I find two outlets. The lobby of the hotel is done in Grand Hyatt fashion, it's got high ceilings, open staircases, huge vases with fresh flowers and gives off a regal impression. I didn't have a chance to have more than a quick bite in the 1st floor restaurant/coffee shop, so can't comment on the food and service. We had some trouble checking-in as our rooms were not ready, but the front desk staff person had us wait on the 2nd floor lobby lounge and offered complimentary drinks, which helped.

It is a grand hotel indeed, and we enjoyed our stay, but it fell short in some important respects and we did not think it lived up to some of the other Grand Hyatts in Asia. In summary, here are the pros and cons we observed: Pros: 1. Excellent staff. Excellent service. Impeccable all around. Always friendly, always helpful, always attentive, prompt and punctual. The people really make this hotel. 2. Some have commented that the lobby is garish or over the top. I thought it was lovely. Then again I love all things Art Deco, and the lobby is an Art Deco heaven. 3. Hard to imagine better views. Given the Grand Hyatt's position on the Hong Kong side of the Harbour, and its off center orientation, most harbor view rooms will showcase a panorama that includes Kowloon to one side, the Harbour in the middle, and Hong Kong skyline on the other side. It was simply breathtaking. We were on the 15th floor. While I usually prefer to be as high up as I can be, being lower at the Grand Hyatt actually gave you a better, more up close view. As we entered the room, it looked like we were floating right on top of the water. 4. Excellent on-site amenities and services, including great business center (prepare to pay through the nose), very nice fitness center, one of the better pools around (if you're interested in using one), many restaurant and lounge choices. 5. Pleasingly crisp and yet warm room decor. Comfortable and functional, and let the stunning view speak for itself without competing with it. These are not the biggest rooms in Hong Kong, but you won't feel cramped. Plenty of closet space and a very large bathroom with great shower water pressure. 6. The Star Ferry dock to Kowloon is very close by. Cons: 1. Except for those attending an event at the convention center, the location of the GH is pretty bad all around. We were there for pleasure and always thoroughly discover cities on foot. We didn't care about public transport stations, but it's still nice to have plenty of restaurants/cafes/shops in the vicinity. You will find very few around the GH. The neighborhood is dominated by office/government buildings, and many run down, seedy bars/clubs a few blocks away. There are many neighborhoods with great restaurants and shops, and others with a more authentic local eatery feel. We got neither of those around the GH. Expect to do a lot of walking through uninteresting neighborhoods around the GH before you arrive anywhere you'd actually want to spend some time. 2. The Champagne Bar in the lobby is a prostitute hang out. Perhaps this is something that's present in all large hotels, but it made me uncomfortable to be surrounded by prostitutes on the prowl at my hotel. They are quite blatant, so the hotel must knowingly tolerate it. 3. This may sound superficial, but the toiletries in the room bathrooms were the worst I've ever used in my life. Given the purported luxury of this hotel and the prices they charge for a night, you'd expect better toiletries. Bring your own, unless you want to use no-name toiletries that are runny and watery, and sting like astringent. Overall, a nice hotel, but for a pleasure trip you are better off staying at the Conrad, Mandarin Oriental, Island Shangri-La, or Four Seasons, all of which are way better situated to let you take full advantage of everything Hong Kong has to offer.", "Date": "November 28, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Sydney, Australia", "Title": "\u201cAmazing service\u201d", "Author": "Kriselda", "ReviewID": "UR21722876", "Content": "My husband and I stayed here for 3 nights.

The room was well serviced and well maintained. I used the gym, which was popular and large (I think there are 2 of them) and had plenty of new equipment. Breakfast buffet was high standard, as was the buffet lunch - a great view, delicious food and quite an experience eating with the wealthy Hong Kong ladies!

Breakfast at the Grand Club level was disappointing. There was little choice- I was really looking forward to a smorgasbord of Hyatt buffet breakfast but was disappointed. Overall, it is a nice hotel but its not worth the HK$4000 price tag. I also wouldnt rate it in my top 10 hotel list. It felt like I was staying at any other 5 star hotel. There was nothing special about it. I agree the hotel is in a strange location in an islolated part of Wan Chai with little food choice in the area.

Top 10 things to do in HK 1 Take a boat or ferry at night to take photographs of the skyline 2 Shop in the local markets, negotiate every price! 3 Take the tram up the HK hill for a great view-- but go early & don't plan on eating there, restaurant selection is poor and crowded 4 Visit the bird market & the flower markets right beside it 5 Take a day trip on the train to mainland China 6 Take a boat trip out to a fish restaurant down the harbour 7 On day one of your trip ask hotel for a recommendation for a tailor and get shirts, suits, dresses, anything you want made to measure while you are there.

These Grand Hyatts are easily identified by their magnificent atrium lobbies; well appointed rooms; and superior health & recreation facilities with large free form pool. However, at the turn of the century, the trend has shifted towards minimalism & contemporary design, which was quickly adopted by newer Grand Hyatts (Shanghai, Beijing) and adapted by older Grand Hyatts. Renovations were soon begun at all Grand Hyatt to achieve this format. Although older Grand Hyatts have successfully rejuvenated their rooms, F&B outlets, ballrooms, pools and building contemporary spas; one problem that they could not tackle is their lobby. Their massive size has prevented any refurbishment program to pass the budget review as renovating the entire lobby would cost a fortune. At the end, older Grand Hyatts now have a mismatch of style with the 90s lobby (some neo-classical) and minimalist for the rest. Mind you, these lobbies are still breathtaking, grand and impress most guests. This is exactly the case with GHHK of which I stayed during the Christmas. LOCATION I would agree with some reviewers that it may not be as perfectly situated as others in Central, Causeway Bay or Kowloon. Luxury travelers & shoppers would prefer Central/Kowloon\u2019s ultra luxury boutiques; The young & trendy would prefer Causeway Bay\u2019s hip establishments; while budget would prefer the upper Kowloon with bargain shops. At WanChai, Grand Hyatt seems to have none, hence doesn\u2019t score well for convenience. In fact, I have the most tiring time walking through the sky bridges and the adjacent surrounding of Wan Chai that didn\u2019t lead me to anywhere I wanted (shop or food). Sure you can hail taxi; but if this is the case, then you have no problem staying at any part of HK or any hotel \u2013 even Cyberport!. SERVICE Attentive, classy and accommodating. Jennifer checked me in with smile, warmth and managed to find the exact room I requested (facing the main pool & bits of the harbour; rather than other building\u2019s fa\u00e7ade and its garden \u2013 I booked a Garden Room, sadly). As usual, whenever I took photos around the hotel, there must be some security guards forbidding me (c\u2019mon, have I got anything negative intended- it won\u2019t be done so obviously and timely \u2013took me half an hour wandering around). Other hotels were purely rude (esp. at the Sofitel Wentworth Sydney where the receptionist screamed over from his desk saying I couldn\u2019t take photos without a person in the pictures -for security-: Is this dumb retarded or \u201cI\u2019m following policy\u201d), but the Hyatt people done it with smile. Next was my visit to the beautiful Plateau where I requested a tour around the tatami styled room with terrace over Victoria Harbour. Anu, the receptionist showed me around with such a class yet utterly friendly. Even the staffs at the business center was very helpful, accommodating and always with a smile (sometimes a rare commodity in HK) ROOMS All harbour rooms are breathtaking needless to say; however opt for the ones facing both Kowloon and Hong Kong skyline for best view. By virtue of its design, the 3 sided fa\u00e7ade of Grand Hyatt fronting the harbour have one side faces mostly HK skyline; one faces mostly Kowloon and one faces both (similar to Excelsior\u2019s Deluxe Harbour View rooms). I wasn\u2019t so lucky as I booked a Garden Room (only 8 of 27 in typical floors: rest are harbour views). Nonetheless, as I\u2019ve studied the floor plan beforehand, I managed to secure the room with an overview of the whole pool/garden areas and a bit of harbour (Room 2105). Each room is unique, where guest will enter diagonally to a small foyer with small dressing table and a floating ward robe. This is a clever design as it provides privacy from seeing the rest of the bedrooms. Bathroom is in triangle shaped and is quite spacious (although in no way to compare with Peninsula\u2019s or Four Seasons\u2019 \u2013 in respond to earlier reviewer). Clad in black marble and mirrors, the bathrooms are still in the original design of the 90s while the rest of the room has been updated with minimalist d\u00e9cor. The circular work desk that you\u2019ll first encounter at the end of the corridor is well placed with the TV at the further most corner of the room, which means you can comfortably watch TV from bed/work desk. Although rooms are on the smaller side (in comparison to Peninsula or FS), they are comfortable. One of the features that I felt quite odd is the way the hotel use to prevent guests from stealing/taking away in-room materials (towels, bathrobes, letter folders). On the very first page of the \u201cin room amenities book\u201d, Grand Hyatt listed what should not be taken away, even listing all the cost of wooden hangers, tea holders, bedside notes folders, shampoo holders, etc. I am amazed how un-classy this upper luxury hotel can be. The sad thing is in-room amenities are \u2018minimalist\u2019 too: 2 pages of notes, 2 pages of letter sheets, few bathroom amenities.. so really, there are nothing much to take away anyway!! FOOD Didn\u2019t try the few restaurants at the hotel as opting for better ones around (Lobby Lounge: better view at InterCon\u2019s; Grand Caf\u00e9: better buffet at TOO at Island Shangri-La; but the Chinese restaurant I heard is quite a legend aside from Man Wah at Mandarin and Spring Moon at Peninsula). RECREATIONAL The Plateau area impressed me, whose concept has been quickly adapted at Grand Hyatt Bangkok (Isawan) and I could imagine the potential at Grand Hyatt Jakarta\u2019s impressive and stunningly beautiful pool area. The gymnasium has a more intimate atmosphere coherent with surrounding Plateau\u2019s public area. Plateau breakfast is served outdoor at the big courtyard with two rows of tree planters where dining experience is directly under the trees. The spaces are amazing and quite romantic. Pool is large and free form, which should be the longest one in HK. Adjacent to Plateau is the gardens of the apartment towers which is accessible to all guest of Grand Hyatt, Renaissance Hotels and two apartments, which also include 2 tennis courts. Ironically, my astonishment of theh Plateau was short-lived. Upon checking-in at the Four Seasons, there is truly no rival to its outdoor pool area with its magnificent setting and edgeless pool \u2013arguably the most impressive of any city hotels in the world!. OVERALL Grand Hyatt is consistently good truly befitting its Hyatt flagship hotel status. Nonetheless for the similar (or slightly higher) price range and location issue, I would prefer and recommend the Four Seasons or the Peninsula. Grand Hyatt initially impressed me, but upon staying at the Four Seasons, it just couldn\u2019t compete with the overall FS experience.

We'd only intended catching a drink before the restaurant but were sated by the time we got down there. Really you wouldn't need anything but the lounge. We've enjoyed each of our stays here, a lot of the opinions criticise it for being a little isolated but I actually quite like that it is not sitting on top of a shopping centre like the other luxury hotels on the island side.

Where to start. Service at this hotel is top notch, the staff is friendly and attentive, and after ten stays, I cannot honestly recall a time when I was served with anything less than a smiling face. Staff halt whatever they are doing the moment they sense you may need anything. The ladies at the business center are possibly some of the most competent and approachable I have ever come across. Club rooms are the way to go here. The club lounge is magnificent, always well staffed, and is a quiet retreat where you can look over the harbor and exhibition center below, and the buffet breakfast is fantastic, serving continental or American. Rooms themselves (both Grand and club) are modern, well appointed, and if you were to ask even those who gave a \"terrible\" rating for whatever reason, I'm sure they would eventually admit that the bathrooms at the Grand Hyatt are possibly the best in HK. Big and marble are how I like my bathrooms, and next to the Park Hyatt Seoul and valley wing at the Shangrila Singapore, these bathrooms are possibly the best in Asia. I left an almost empty bottle of cologne in my room once, came back three months later and there it was carefully placed on small face flanel, positioned next to the soap on the sink, awaiting my arrival. If you are a gold passport member, platinum or diamond, the staff will make a point of remembering your name from the moment you check in. Small luxuries such as [real] coffee are brought to your room free of charge at anytime you request it, as is the breakfast. Stay there five times, and you become a VIP, although its hard to grasp what this means as I have never felt as though I was anything less. Some reviews I have read on this site have stated that the location is bad as far as proximity to shopping goes, which is true if you expect the shopping to be right outside your door, and in this case I suggest you find accomodations on Kowloon. Pacific Place, possibly the best shopping mall in HK, is seven minutes walk away, and a couple of bucks if you don't like to sweat and prefer to take a cab, which would get you there faster than it would if you were right above it at the Shangri-la and had to spend half an hour waiting for the elevators that are ALWAYS full. For long haul fliers, I recommend the mercedes airport pickup, (about 790HKD if i recall), which is well worth the extra. The driver even offers a Norah Jones soundtrack along with the wet towel, bottled water and newspaper awaiting you in the back seat.", "Date": "December 11, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Cove,Hampshire", "Title": "\u201cMust be the best in HKG\u201d", "Author": "RFCMod", "ReviewID": "UR4152225", "Content": "After staying in many top hotels in HKG this was my first trip to the Grand Hyatt Arriving after a 11 hr flight I was ready to drop So arriving in my room was bliss, the room is of top notch modern design with hidden detailing in switches and cupboards with a very bright large bathroom Bed was extremely comfortable and added towards a terrifc nights sleep Very nice cafe style restaurant on the lobby floor gave a good view out to the harbour and gave excellent service and did a terrific cooked breakfast The champagne bar again gave excellent service and is in formal and a good way to relax after a good day working in smoggy HKG This hotel is granduous to say the least and its grandeur is shown the companies who use the conference facilities for annual meetings (Microsoft to give one example) A great hotel, good location and definately one for the future", "Date": "November 29, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "New York, NY", "Title": "\u201cPlateau spa, Grand Hyatt- Best hotel experience ever!\u201d", "Author": "jnice", "ReviewID": "UR4143641", "Content": "My husband and I spent 3 nights at the Plateau Spa in the Grand Hyatt, Hong Kong for our honeymoon in June 2005.

When the kids arrived, the adjoining room had already been 'released' to another guest and they offered a room a couple of doors down. When I nixed that, they suggested I move yet again. When they moved me, I realized the rooms they gave me were smoking rooms! The hotel also specializes in nickel-and-diming their guests.

The hotel is by no means cheap, however ask about corporate discounts when you book. We didn't get one, but our travelling companions did get a reduction in their room rate because of a company affiliation. Speaking of reservations, be very careful when you do book your room at this property. Get your reservation info in writing, if you can. Our booking was made by calling Hyatt's toll-free call centre in North America. The room rate we were quoted and that we reserved under was based on double occupancy, but when time came to check in, GHHK tried to tell us that the rate we got was for single occupancy and wanted to charge us an additional $200/night for a second person. Unfortunately, it took some arguing and getting the on-duty manager involved, but the issue was ultimately resolved quickly and our original room rate was charged. FYI - HK hotels charge a 13% hospitality tax per night, so don't be surprised if your bill looks larger than expected when you check out. Our room was fantastic: clean, modern, well-appointed, free green tea, huge marble bathroom with glass shower and separate soaker tub, comfy king-size bed, extra pillows and a great view of the harbour (for which we paid extra). We also got a free daily continental breakfast delivered right to our room because I was a Gold Passport member (Hyatt's loyalty program). There is housekeeping twice a day (morning and night) and the GHHK boasts the biggest hotel pool in HK with awesome chaise longues at poolside. This hotel also has the most friendly, courteous staff I have ever encountered. However, there are a few not-so-great things about GHHK. For instance, it's one of the few major HK hotels that does not offer shuttle service from Chek Lap Kok (HK Int'l Airport) and it's also not the best location in terms of proximity to shopping, restaurants and entertainment. As an acknowledgement of this, GHHK offers a free London cab shuttle service to Central, which is the major \"action\" area on HK Island. However, there is no schedule for the shuttle, you can't book it in advance, it runs only until 6pm and it's not available on weekends. We only used it once during our stay. Also, the pool has no set hours. It's open from dawn until dusk, which means don't count on going for a swim past 5:30pm. The on-site restaurants were great, but pricey, as is usually expected with hotel dining. The Grand Caf\u00e9 on the main level offers a nice menu selection and a fantastic evening dinner buffet until 10pm. The hotel's flagship restaurant, One Harbour Road, is easily the best authentic Chinese food I've ever had. The hotel is close to 7-11 and Starbucks, as well as the Star Ferry terminal to Kowloon and within short walking distance to the MTR (subway). For some reason, the concierges at GHHK do nothing but recommend taking a taxi when you ask for directions somewhere. We were keen to walk many places and found this lack of help frustrating. But overall, our stay here was great and we would recommend it to others considering booking a room.", "Date": "November 20, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "5.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Unknown", "Title": "\u201cExcellent Service\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR4100650", "Content": "We stayed at the Grand Hyatt for 3 nites, end October.

Excellent service and always with a smile! And the housekeeping was meticulous and generous. The room was very comfortable with a huge bed and comfy pillows. The bathroom was luxurious with a long bath and a shower stall and marble flooring and gold finishing. It's a little out of the way, by the waterfront, but that gives it the fantastic view from the rooms of the skyline and of the harbour. You go to sleep watching the many colourful lights on the buidlings across at the CBD area. Getting around from the hotel was easy as there were plentiful cabs throughout the day. And the Star Ferry Terminus is within walking distance (at most an 8 min walk). The chinese restaurant served up delicious fare. And the poolside cafe was a great place to have lunch and to unwind after a hectic morning's shopping.
