If the cleaning is important for you, hotel rooms are too much clean. The woman who is responsible for cleaning and breakfast is has a smily face but no english:) But while serving breakfast and cleaning the dishes she is could be little more calm. Breakfast is poor( (Croissant;bread,fruit yogurt,nutella,butter,coffee,fruit juice). Our room is too small but it could not be problem. Only Bathroom( it is clean) is very small. Closet and sink is too closed. while sitting you can put your head for sleeping:)", "Date": "October 5, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "4", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "1", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "MADRAS", "Title": "\u201cAn okay hotel, but badly soundproofed\u201d", "Author": "kaulm", "ReviewID": "UR56356390", "Content": "I chose the hotel because of its okay location and moderate pricing. After a nice welcome I got to my room which was a single bedroom. Room overall was very clean. The bathroom also was very clean, but so tiny that i couldn't go to the basin or shower without touching the toilet seat with my legs. As it was winter, the room and especially the ground were really cold. Anyway, in summer AC is available at an additional 10,- EUR a night. Negative aspects are the bad soundproof and location. The thing that annoyed me most, was the bad soundproof. I could hear everything what was happening in the floor, reception and surrounding rooms. That is, I heard the venerable hosts having a feisty Italian martial quarrel from 8PM - 11PM. I could understand every single word. Only after I put on my TV to make them realize that I was there, they spoke softly for about 1 minute and broke out again, not sensitive enough to shift their business outside or home. As it was more entertainment than anything else to me, I didn't care to much. Still, I find it rude that they didn't care about their guests being potentially disturbed. What really made me feel uncomfortable at my stay there was that -vice versa- everything I did was audible outside in the hotel. Especially when there was no environmental noise (nighttime), somebody outside my room could notice my chewing a gum or dropping a matchstick. In that way, there was no privacy. No going to the loo was unnoticed. When I wanted to check out, I found the reception empty, had to wait 15 minutes (till 7AM) for somebody to come. My first credit card did not work there, but fortunately my second one did. Funnily enough, the employee had to call her boss to find out the rate. But in the end, all worked but time had passed. I never joined breakfast, so theres no comment on the food. I would definitely go for another hotel, located west from Termini Station, as the neighborhood there is much better to stay. Still, at the Aristotele one can get a clean place to stay for a mediocre price.", "Date": "February 18, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Calgary, Canada", "Title": "\u201cGood location; short on amenities.\u201d", "Author": "Calgary68", "ReviewID": "UR45518059", "Content": "Very clean, tiny, inexpensive (by Rome pricing) hotel on Via Palestro, 4 blocks NE of Termini, across Via Marsala. 80E* per night gets you a rather large bedroom \u2013 ours had 3 twin beds, two of which were joined at the hip as it were (not uncommon in Europe) to make one queen size. A very good (if tiny) bathroom with shower, toilet and bidet. * The 80E was for the room without air conditioning \u2013 but we were not told that until we complained the next morning. They reluctantly (but properly) gave us the remote control for the air conditioning for the remainder of our stay. (It was 90E with air) Reasonable value and one of five (really) hotels in the same building. You could skip their breakfast and not miss a lot. No wifi, no desk clerk after hours both reduce the rating this hotel might othrwise have earned.

The hotel is located behind Termini Station. The hotel is in a building with 2 floors. The room was clean, but I felt it was a bit pricy for the type of hotel. It included breakfast, but you have to eat the same thing everyday and it became very boring. If you return to the hotel very late at night, you have to use a key to get in from the front entrance. Then once on your floor you have to use another key to get into another area. My room was located on the 4th floor so if you like to sleep beyond 7:30am, this hotel is not for you. You should be up by 7:30AM because it gets very nosey. The location is OK. I am not a big fan of termini station because of all the people hanging out late at night and I did not feel safe. Liked: clean room Did not like: the key system, I felt like I was in prison. A bit too pricy for the quality. No phone in the room.
