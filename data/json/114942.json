The Adolphus is a wonderful location and convenient for any event near downtown Dallas. In addition it is a short walk to many Dallas restaurants. Check in at the hotel was as easy as I have ever experienced. I went inside to check in while my husband took care of turning our car over to the valet parking. He and I were both on the way to our room within minutes of arrival. The lobby area was very \"old world\" and would have been a fun place to sit and people watch if we had the time to kill. Our room was very comfortable, clean, and tastefully decorated, but was nothing extraordinary. My only complaint was that there was only one bath towel and it was a bit flimsy...... not the thick fluffy towels I would have expected at the Adolphus. When I called housekeeping and requested additional towels, they were delivered more quickly than I have ever experienced. The staff at the Adolphus was the most pleasant and attentive that I have seen in any hotel. Any employee was ready to assist at any time. I was especially impressed with the gentleman working the valet parking in the evening. Every time we went in or out, he remembered us and welcomed us back. In the morning we ate breakfast at the Bistro. Our waitress, Petra, was \"The Best\". She was pleasant, efficient, and made sure that we needed nothing. As a bonus to the wonderful service, we thoroughly enjoyed the Crabmeat Eggs Benedict, and the Texas Scramble.

I used to live in Dallas in the 80's, and always wanted to stay here so I was very excited at my chance. We were up on the 14th floor, so had a fairly nice view. Mostly of other buildings, but a little garden or something too which was nice. We too had the issue of getting hot water out of both taps in the bathroom - but sometimes cold would come out of the hot one too. So you always had to be really careful before you filled up a glass or washed your face to make sure you had the right temperature that you wanted! Our first night we wanted to go to Deep Ellum for dinner, which is only about a mile away. The hotel has a \"hotel car\" that will take you anywhere in a 3 mile radius for free, up to 8pm. So instead of calling up my car and trying to figure out the directions myself, we decided to try the hotel car. Getting there was fine, and we had a nice dinner. The driver gives you his card with a phone number on it to call when you wanted to come back. So at 7pm when we were done we called and he said he'd be about 10 minutes. It was a beautiful night so we didn't mind waiting. At 7:30 we called again to see if he forgot about us - turned out he did, and was taking someone to the airport so would not be able to come get us at all. We were not thrilled at all about being stranded, especially in an area that does not get a lot of cab traffic. We ended up walking the mile back to our hotel using the directions on google maps on my phone - not exactly the dream ending to our first day in Dallas. The next morning we were up early and called for our car - it was ready in minutes and we pulled out around 7:30am to head to Fort Worth. We had several things to do early, but ended up spending the whole day there and didn't return to our room until 7pm. So we were gone for 11 1/2 hours, the hotel knew we were gone at 7:30am since they brought up our car, and yet was our room cleaned and serviced? You guessed it, no. I was too tired to deal with it, just wanted a shower so I started to take my shower. Then my daughter interrupts me to say that the maids were there (it is now 7:30PM) to clean the room. Needless to say I was not very happy about the whole thing - maid apologized for being there so late but it really didn't make things right for us. I spoke to the front desk about it the next morning when we were checking out, and I was told that they would tell the cleaning department that we didn't like having our room done so late. Really? Like there are guests that wouldn't mind that happening? Hotel was historic, beautiful, and gave my kids an experience that they hadn't had before.

After checkout on that visit, I was left with a warm and lingering delight of having richly enjoyed such a truly Grand Hotel. When I arrived last Saturday, the same Doorman who was on duty on my previous stay looked me straight in the eye and said \"Welcome Back.\" Then he asked me if I was going to need a cab to the Meyerson Symphony Hall later, even though that was on my last visit over a year and a half ago... The Adolphus is a rare example of a Great Hotel where service being executed so Masterfully, on such a pinnacle level isn't noticed because it is so fine. If you haven't yet made it to the Homestead, or the Greenbrier, or the Williamsburg Inn, then this is as close as it comes from decor, to unparalleled dining, to the quiet and seamless execution of hospitality, and most of all, to the awareness that you've enjoyed the very edge of all that First Class genuinely means. It's the reason you forget the other Hotel Loyalty programs you're enrolled in as their double points or whatever else they promise cannot touch the richness and depth of a stay at the Adolphus and the subtle rejuvenating elements that seem to stay with you long after you've left and whisper to you that you deserved this. On this visit, I had a Junior Suite exactly like the one I had last time. Very spacious, gorgeous sitting area with tables and chairs, and above all that, it's soooo quiet. I took a couple of friends to dinner in the French Room, which is a culinary delight with a divinely welcoming feeling despite the stunning decor and five star rating. Excellent beyond my realm of praise and not to be missed. And the BEST part of this is that IT WAS AFFORDABLE!!!! For all that I got to experience, a Junior Suite, a couple of drinks, and dinner for three at The French Room was about $440.00 including tips and cocktails. The one thing I missed were the Pillows from my previous stay. They were white, and had red embroidered borders and the stylized \"A\" logo in the center. I know the hotel has been sold and repurchased since then, and I hope the new owners restore this feature as it lets the guest know \"Yes, you're really at the Adolphus.\" I regard this as a great value, because in every way, it was a Great Experience that I will surely repeat. I am so glad I made the decision to think for myself when choosing this instead of being persuaded by another loyalty program. It's the experience you really should give to yourself.

Service- In a word, excellent. From the valet, to the check in, room service, bartenders, everyone is kind and attentive. I've stayed all over the US and Mexico and the Adolphus has a great staff. Decor- The Adolphus is stately. Nothing modern here, and that's the way it should be. If you the Joule or the W stay there. This hotel was built in a different era, and it exudes luxury of a bygone era. Rooms- The rooms always have big closets, the beds are not the best, but not bad. Each room has an huge window that can't be opened, something about the city's smoking ban. It's criminal to not be able to open up these windows. Food/Beverages- The French Room is not to be missed. We've only eaten there once, and it was amazing. Very pricey though, but worth it. There is a peanuts on the floor honky tonk bar that we always end up at.

My disappointment came not from the ambiance of the hotel, but from the positively dreadful service I encountered on every front. My room, a king suite, was dirty. Not filthy, but just dirty and in need of the special attention one expects from a hotel of this caliber. The wallpaper was dingy, there were worn spots on the chair at the desk, the vents were dusty, there was dust trapped between the wood and the glass of the coffee table, and the sheets on the bed had small holes. Nothing seemed polished or shined. Admittedly, these are small things and did not detract from the comfort of my stay. They were the first things I noticed, however, and these things matter. I returned on the second day of my stay at 5:30 p.m. to find that the room was still unmade. The towels from my morning shower were still on the floor where I had left them nearly 11 hours earlier, the bed remained unmade, and the curtains still drawn. I had to phone housekeeping and ask someone to come up and clean my room. I found this unacceptable. On the third night, I called the front desk/hotel operator six times between 10:30 and 11:15 p.m. to arrange a wake up call. On each attempt, the phone rang and rang and rang. Once I was connected to someone in the garage after 20 or so rings; on another, I found myself speaking with someone from security. At no point did anyone at the front desk answer. When I checked out the following morning at 5:40 a.m., no one was at the front desk. I waited and waited, and after perhaps 5 minutes someone emerged from a back room.

We arrived at the hotel in February of 2011. It has taken me so long to write a review because it was an experience that I would rather forget. We are returning to Dallas this month for an event that we attend every year and I will never stay at this hotel again. Things started off with an inordinately long wait in line to check in. After 30 minutes, we finally approached the front desk and were pleasantly surprised by an offer to upgrade to a suite. Great service, I thought. After taking the very small elevator to our room, we unpacked and decided to go out to dinner. We used the car service to get to the restaurant, which was fine. Upon return to the hotel, we approached our room only to find the door frame in splinters. Our room had been burglarized. I can't tell you how afraid we were. We called the front desk to report it and were told that security would be on their way up. We also called the police. After waiting for about 15 minutes, a security person arrived, but did not seem to know what to do. We asked him if the hotel had any type of surveillance system, and we were told that it did not. A short time later, the police arrived, as did the hotel night manager. The police inventoried the losses in our room and provided us with a police file number. The police wanted to canvas other hotel guests to see if anyone heard anything unusual, BUT THE MANAGER ASKED THEM NOT TO SINCE HE DID NOT WANT TO ALARM THE OTHER GUESTS. Which said to me that he was not concerned about our experience at all. He told us that the hotel was sold out but that he could \"probably find us a room in the hotel, but it would definitely not be a suite.\" It was very clear to us that we were not wanted in the hotel. He offered to relocate us to another hotel, which we gladly accepted. When we arrived at the other hotel, there were problems during check-in. Apparently the manager failed to provide the new hotel with information about our party. The hotel was unable to reach the manager at the Adolphus. I called from my cell phone, and was told that the manager had left for the evening. After a very short conversation with another Adolphus hotel employee, we were able to check in to the hotel. In short, my experience at this hotel was horrible, and was compounded by the way it was handled by hotel management. No apology was ever offered, and I felt like they were more interested in containing what happened to us that addressing our frightening experience.", "Date": "February 4, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Washington, D.C.", "Title": "\u201cOverRATED!!!!\u201d", "Author": "gingii", "ReviewID": "UR123924986", "Content": "I was very excited for our stay with this hotel.

The hotel was advertised as a four star luxury hotel but in reality it felt more like a typical stay at a Holiday Inn. While the hotel staff were exceptional my experiences with the accounting staff, to get a single receipt for my expense report, was frustrating and upsetting. The hotel itself was rather nice although it felt dusty and all of the floors could have used vacuuming. Our double room was of a nice size but the beds were somewhat uncomfortable and we could hear buses as they past our room (even though we were on the 8th floor). It should also be noted that housekeeping didn't arrive until 5:45pm, just as we were returning from a long day. Seriously? I never heard of housekeeping not getting to a room by 4 or 5 at the latest.

I called the operator and while she said I wouldn't be charged there was little sympathy, especially when I raised the spectre of security concerns. As I'm a male, this wasn't overly a concern so I simply told her that I wouldn't like to be charged. I ate breakfast in the Bistro and while the food was okay, it was very expensive and the decor again was not up to snuff or comparable to the French Room or the rest of the hotel. The Adolphus definitely could use a brand revitalization or say lessons from the Ritz in Customer Service to bring it back up - management, please, pay attention to what is happening to this jewel and the customer experienc. I purposefully did not even touch the minibar drinks as a diet Pepsi was listed at 3.50 which I thought was a bit steep. I had gotten a good rate for the Adolphus at 160.00/night, a big discount but even so this was definitely not an experience for this kind of supposedly upscale hotel, especially as I saw from the lobby previously in the 80's the Queen of England and Duke of Edinburgh had stayed there. If you're even paying a dollar more than 100.00 , I'd say no, probably about 65.00 would have been fair for the location if someone hadn't drank the beer from the minibar and not left it in the middle of the room when I returned from my conference that day.", "Date": "January 26, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Kentucky - USA", "Title": "\u201cOld money hotel in downtown D\u201d", "Author": "EnergyManager", "ReviewID": "UR123577551", "Content": "Great location and a wonderful lobby.

The is one of the \"grand old hotels\" downtown so we thought it would be fun to step back to that decor, etc. It is lovely inside but that is where it stops. We had drinks at the French Room bar (NOT in the actual restaurant) and while it is pretty, the tables continued to be covered with dirty dishes the whole hour we were there. There was one server and he never came to our side of the room. My husband had to go to the bar, get the drinks, clear our table of drink glasses and then return to the bar to sign the check. Our two drinks were $25. Wine and martini. One would think that we could have had a little service sometime in the hour. The same occurred the next night. Guess we were hopeful that the previous night was just unusual but not! Ditto this night too. When we came in to check in there was only an empty reception desk-it was about 6pm. We waited, wondering if we were in the right place. Finally we were going up on escalator to find check in when a young woman came out from the back and asked if she could help us. Well duh. We are standing there with bags and looking confused. She did the minimal amount of talking, never welcomed us, never said a thing about sorry she wasn't at reception and did not tell us where to go next which was up the escalator and to the elevators to get to the room. Our room was large (had a suite) and bathroom was nice. However, several of the light bulbs were burned out and the phone by the bed did not work. (They came but were never able to get it going.) We used the one on the desk. Did not replace bulbs. When housekeeping came, she did not replace the towels (there was not sign in the room about reusing towels which is ok with me but I want to know that so I can hang mine up to dry properly) and did not even rehang our old ones. (We hang our towels but not neatly and flat if we don't expect to use again.) The towels were bunched up and still wet. There was not a concierge desk! When I wanted to ask questions I had to go to a podium near front door and speak to the man who apparently was head bellman (first day) and a man in a suit who, when asked if I could ask him a concierge type question answered, well you can. (??) He wasn't the least bit interested in what I wanted to know and it turned out that his directions were exacly backwards. He said go west and it was actually east. Well, check out was the same. About 10am there were many of us waiting to check out and only one man working. We could hear a group of people behing the wall at reception laughing and talking. Finally one came out to help (no apology) and later another came out. The cars were always stacked up outside with not enough people to move and park them. BUT the French Room is wonderful.

At check out, I stood in line for 15-20 min (the lack of a \"queue\" system had hotel patrons being serviced in no particular order), and when I finally got up to the counter, the front desk attendant said she had to leave, would be back shortly, and promptly left. The 2 other front desk people continued to attend to other people who'd been waiting far less time than me.

The most amazing part about this \"towel\" problem though...It was going on for DAYS!!!! We arrived at 5pm. We had no bath towels, no hand towels, no rags, no robes, nothing. We also had a tiny bit of toilet paper. So I did what any normal person would do, call the front desk. They would take care of this \"immediately.\" We left for the evening and returned about 11pm. Guess what? Nothing had been done. Not even the toilet paper. So I called and asked again. The man told me they were out of towels but that they would send me 2 robes. Really? He said he was getting a list together of people that needed them. He said he could also send us toilet paper. This never happened either. So by midnight I was walking around on our floor asking people for towels. Everyone was having a similar problem, but at least they had 1 or 2 towels. I went down to the front desk and noticed sticky notes of rooms that had no towels. They would write down my room number again each time, even though I said they already had it on that list. I was offered no solution, no compensation of any type, no explanation, no way to make things better. I was just told, along with others, that someone would be in tonight to wash towels and they would have them out by 6am. And no, that never happened either. A man working the actual wedding finally pulled me aside and said he would go around and find everything he could. So AFTER MIDNIGHT I got 2 robes, 1 bath towel, and 1 rag. Yes, and finally some toilet paper. It was amazing to me as a human being to see so many people unable to find a fix to a problem that had been happening for days. So let me see if I can give you some suggestions: 1 - Find 2 people, either front desk, butlers, bar workers, bus boys, whoever: GO WASH TOWELS, BRING THEM TO THE FRONT DESK IMMEDIATELY (DON'T HAVE TO FOLD THEM) - I know what these washers and dryers look like and how they work. They are not difficult to run (we have them in our athletic areas at school). 2 - If washers are down, take them to a washateria (sp?). You easily could have so many towels and rags back for customers by night time. 3 - Send someone (see above) to go BUY some towels. Walmart, Target, Dollar Stores, you name it. 4 - Call single-occupant rooms and see if possibly you could gather up a few. 5 - Give people compensation of some type. Free breakfast, drinks, money off night, free valet, something, anything. 6 - Don't just tell people what they want to hear. Tell them the real problems. Explain how you are going to fix them. People have to be problem-solvers. People have to take enough pride in their business to have to WANT to fix things. I saw so many people standing around that could have been working on some kind of fix to these problems. I will not ever recommend someone staying there. In fact, if someone says they are going to this area in Dallas, I will only recommend one thing, don't stay here. And by the way, a \"We are so sorry about the problems you encountered.

It has a wonderul \"air\" about it that something more modern looking can't even come close to! It's not supposed to be a hotel with sleek lines and modern furniture, it's SUPPOSED to be JUST the way that it is. Their display of antiques and art is fabulous, only surpassed by the service. Their front desk personnel was delightful! I booked our room through priceline and was not treated any differently than full price customers, as some others previously made note of! We didn't want to travel out of downtown really to eat--we live in Houston and have plenty of restaurants there. We just wanted to relax and hang out; the concierge suggested a good little Italian place for our first night--it wasn't Damian's in Houston, but it was quite good and hit the spot! I had made reservations at a \"seen and be seen\" Sushi spot, but asked the concierge for another suggesion in downtown or Deep Ellum. He suggested \"Deep\" which turned out to me great and just what we were looking for before leaving Dallas the next day. We travel quite a bit and I truly didn't have any complaints about my stay; if I could come up with any \"critique\" it is that the rooms that are for housekeeping, near the ends of the halls, their door jambs could use replacing. They have been beat up by the carts and painted over and over...and the ONLY reason I noticed it was because one of the doors was RIGHT next to ours and it did look \"shabby\".

How classy is that!! The young lady who checked me in, Liz, I believe, was as sweet as can be. She took her time to find me the best room that they had available and introduced me to the bellman who would be taking my bags up (unfortunately, I have misplaced his name, but he was very professional and efficient). As I headed up the escalator, under the opulent chandelier, and into the incredibly gorgeous upper lobby, I really felt like I had been whisked away to the golden years! My room, a standard room I believe, was large and spacious - much more so than your Hiltons or Hyatts - and adorned with vintage-looking though well-kept furnishings. I had one of the best sleeps of my life that night on the ridiculously comfortable bed. The next morning, as I headed downstairs, there was Chris again, in the lobby chatting up guests. I swear - does he ever go home? I was surprised when he remembered me by name and asked how my room was and if I needed anything. The hotel appeared to be quite busy - how could he remember one guest amongst hundreds? He's a treasure, to be sure. Eve, or Eva, checked me out that morning - efficeient and friendly. There was a bit of a delay waiting on my car, but nothing worth docking points for. There were some grumpy people not happy about the wait - seriously, folks, calm down a bit! Is that 5 minutes of your life really worth getting your blood presure up? If you're tired of staying in carbon copy, boxy \"modern\" hotels where you're just another room number, try the Adolphus!

Stains happen and at a mid-level motel it is too be expected, but I think this is not acceptable at the level the Adolphus purports to be. Most upsetting, the hotel is tremedously understaffed at certain times. From the momenth I walked downstairs to check-out until I was in my car on my way was over 45 minutes. This was mostly due to long waits for the valets and about a 10 wait in line at reception to check-out. We will be back to the French Room again, but I do not expect us to stay at the Adolphus.

It is one of the closest hotels to the convention center, which is a 10 minute walk away. However, except for the convenience, and the elegant public spaces on the first floor, there is not much to recommend this hotel. Some specific things that travelers should know about. 1) My room (809, if someone from the Adolphus is reading this) was very spacious, but had numerous problems. The air conditioning unit was so loud that I had to turn the power off just so that I could get to sleep at night (fortunately, I was not in Dallas during its run of 100 degree days). There was no light switch near the door, so when I came back at night, I had to hope I could race over to one of the lamps on the other side of the room before the door closed and left me in total darkness. And the plumbing was a real mess: water in the shower, even at the lowest setting, was too hot to stand under. Even the water coming out of the cold water tap at the sink was warm. Maybe I should have traded rooms with the reviewer who complained that they had no hot water at all. 2) The cleaning staff clearly wasn't paying attention to what they were doing. I was there for two nights, and when I got in the shower the second morning, I discovered that the cleaning staff had removed the partially used shampoo and conditioner bottles I had left there the day before, without replacing them with new ones. It would have been perfectly fine if they had left the old ones there, since they were still more than half full. But as it was, I only had the bar soap to wash my hair with. They also didn't replace the coffee for the coffee maker, but since I wasn't soaking wet in the shower when I discovered that, I was able to call housekeeping to send a replacement. It was clear that the room hadn't been vacuumed in a while either; there were several large crumbs on the carpet. 3) The front desk was also a disappointment. I got to the hotel early , and my room was not ready. They took my cell number and told me they would call as soon as it was ready. I explained that this was important, since I had planned on taking a conference call from my room that afternoon. As the time got closer and I still hadn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t heard from them, I called the hotel to find out how much longer it would take. They told me that the room was already ready, they just hadn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t called. The bottom line is this: If you are there for a convention center event like I was, and aren't going to spend much time in the room, the Adolphus may be perfectly adequate. But if you are in Dallas for any other reason, I have to think that you could do much better than this sorry place..", "Date": "October 21, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Atlanta, Georgia", "Title": "\u201cWhat a treat!\u201d", "Author": "Kelli G", "ReviewID": "UR119527372", "Content": "Stayed this past weekend at The Adolphus in Dallas.

If given the choice, I will always choose an old, classic hotel over something new and modern. Hotels of this age, like the Drake in Chicago, typically have grand and glorious public areas, wonderful service and good restaurants, but the rooms are usually small and frankly a little shabby. That is what I expected with the Adolphus, but that is certainly not what I encountered. I will break down my observations: Rooms: The rooms FAR surpassed my expectations. They had clearly been renovated fairly recently. The furnishings were newer, and the bathroom was great. I was in a standard room with two double beds, and it was much larger than I had expected. If you've read my reviews before, you know that I'm extremely picky about water pressure in the shower, and old hotels typically rate TERRIBLY in this regard. I am pleased to report that the Adolphus has great showers. In fact, if I hadn't just renovated my bathroom, I would inquire as to the types of shower heads they have - that's how good they were. Even the linens were great. Sometimes in nice hotels, you get towels that are obviously older, but these all seemed brand new. Public Spaces: This hotel has absolutely fabulous lobby areas. Dark woods, high ceilings, nice furniture and antiques abound. I spent much time between my meetings just enjoying the surroundings in the lobby. It would be a great spot to meet friends for coffee or just to chat. Meeting Rooms: My group had meetings in several of the ballrooms, and our meeting sizes ranged from about 15 people up to as many as 200 at one time, and the hotel accommodated them all wonderfully. A/V setups were very good. Food: My one regret from my stay was that I did not get the chance to eat at the French Room. Several in my group said that the meals they had there during our stay were absolutely incredible. I will say that the food served to our group for breakfast, lunch and as appetizers at our nightly cocktail party was exceptional. Oftentimes, the \"banquet\" type food at these meetings is mediocre at best, but this was certainly very good. Location: I will confess that I am a stranger to Dallas. This was my first time to the city other than a layover at DFW. The hotel seemed to be in the middle of the business district, but as all my meetings were at the hotel, that was somewhat irrelevant. I did go out for dinner both nights, and both times, we had to take a taxi to get to the restaurants, but others in my group did walk to some nearby options. The surrounding streets seem to clear out after business hours, so I don't know that there are lots of entertainment options within walking distance. I may be wrong on that, though. Service: This is what really sets the hotel apart. I probably encountered 30 different staff members over three days, and they were all exceptional. From the front desk, to the shoe shine guy (who does a great job), to the bellhop and even the housekeeping people whom I passed in the hall: everyone was polite and helpful. I even witnessed someone in my group ask a passing staff member, \"where can I get a cup of coffee?\" (it was about 4 PM and we were between meetings). The staff member said, \"I'll be happy to get you one, how do you take it?\" And one minute later, he appeared with the coffee. This is indicative of the level of service that I perceive the Adolphus expects from their staff. Everyone appears very eager to please, and that's a key aspect of a great hotel. Overall, this is a wonderful hotel. If I make it back to Dallas, I will make every effort to give them my business. I stay in probably 10 upmarket hotels per year, and the Adolphus is the best I have encountered in quite some time. If I take time to write a review, it's either because there is something wrong or it was just a great experience.

We were a litlle put out as my wire and I had never slept together in a \"regular-sized bed\". Overall the Hotel was nice and our bellman Anibal was very nice and informative. We had read that the garage was slow in retrieving vehicles, but they were very busy while we were there, and we never waited for our car over 5 mins. We used the hotel's free sedan service (Lincoln Town Car) on tow occasions: 1. We met friends at House of Blues for dinner, 2. Broadway Musical \"Hair\" at the Windspear Theatre. Our driver was very nice and helpful. We think that the Adolphus was a great value and would tell others if you are going to Dallas, it is a very nice place to stay.", "Date": "September 27, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Bullard, Texas", "Title": "\u201cOld world style, modern comfort...\u201d", "Author": "laylahouse", "ReviewID": "UR118579665", "Content": "The Adolphus combines old world grace and elegance with free wi-fi and a cold a/c!

Obviously it has a bit of a reputation in the big D, and as it's home to the French Room, I had pictured something out of a ritzy hotel in a movie. It was definitely fancier than I'm used to! The first floor is very dark and very old school, with lots of stained wood and dim lighting and high ceilings. Upon arrival, the man at reception who checked us in sort of treated me like I was a criminal or that I was somehow doing something underhanded -- admittedly, I'd accidentally booked the name under my old last name instead of my current one. Instead of immediately asking me to provide information on the reservation (my address, my email, etc), he acted as if there wasn't anything he could do to verify it. It was easily solved after I just stood there and told him to verify me some other way, but really? Come on man. Also, when I reserved the room, I requested a room with a balcony as I'd read other customers had done. He didn't mention it at all when we checked in and so no, we weren't given one. (One of the girls smokes.) Our room was large and more than roomy enough for the four of us. The mini-bar can double as a mini-fridge in a pinch. The services we needed were all taken care of almost immediately, from an extra robe/towels to sending someone up to uncork our wine for us. The concierge suggested us to a delicious BBQ place nearby and even provided us with a discount -- and not a tacky coupon, either, just his name to mention when we arrived. (Swanky!) In the event you don't have a lot of money to toss around, I recommend checking on the Adolphus' rates next time you want a little getaway. We got a steal on a room without even using a third-party company to book it. The interior may be a tad bit dated, but if it's good enough for the Queen and rock stars, it's good enough for me. I heard someone mention that one of the elevators is supposedly haunted.

I was also informed the restaraunt had a fixed priced menu at $85.00 per person not including wine (well above my allowance). I can see why the only people in the restaraunt were over 70 and clearly there for a \"special celebration\". The only other option was the bar in the basement where the average patron age was 25 years old. The food was definitely freever pack food warmed up when ordered but there were lots of salted peanuts in the shell to be eaten and more shells on the floor, not a great environment for a relaxing meal after a long day of business. Perhaps the most disappointing experience was the bar, I went to the bar after dinner to order a glass of wine before heading to bed. I was the only parton in the bar. I waited atleast 8 to 10 minutes at the bar as the bar tender poured drinks for waitresses and cleaned his station. finally four other guests came to the bar and now he turned to provide service. I asked what white wines he had by the glass, he grabbed a one page wine menu, tossed it at me and without saying a word went to server the newly arrived guests. Once he finished serving the newly arrived guests he gave me time to order. All wine on the menu is fixed priced at $12.00. I ordered glass of Russian River Pinot Gris, the glass was poured, the last one in the bottle. i had a few sips and informed the waiter I thought the wine had turned as it had that acidy, taste and tingly feeling. The waiter tried the wine and said it was perfectly fine and questioned my knowledge of wine I tried a few more sips and side the wine was definitely bad (I live in California and we trravel to wine country a fair bit, the wine was definitely turned). .

Yay! Now, I assume its common knowledge that 4 star hotels and up will influence your first impressions of their establishment by luxuriously decorating their lobbies. The Adolphus lobby wasn't a lobby though: it was an extension of Buckingham Palace. I have never, in my relatively short span of traveling, seen a lobby as extravagantly decorated as this one. Huge Renaissance-like paintings and portraits graced the walls, with one section so rife with horticulture it almost seemed like they brought elements of the Safari in to help decorate the place. There is a front desk, then a gift shop, then an escalator that feeds into the heart of the lobby, at which point you have the option of choosing between three dining establishments, the highly upscale and award winning French Room, the more casual dining experience of the Bistro, and finally the Rodeo Grill and Bar. A little something for everyone. So breathtaking was this lobby that there is simply no way entering your room is not going to be an anticlimactic experience. The hotel is quite old, and while the rooms clearly shown signs of having been built in another era, it was clean, very spacious, and comfortable, including a love seat/couch, coffee table, and LCD TV. The wifi was a bit spotty though, and of course, as is typical for 4 star establishments, I had no microwave and only a fridge bar to cram some of my 2-liter bottles of soda in. Speaking of which, there is at least one supermarket within walking distance, so if you're looking to save costs on dining you'll find plenty of options nearby. Unless I missed it, I believe valet parking is the only option here, but it wasn't too bad for $24 overnight (guess I've been used to Boston and New York's absurd parking fees). It is highly, HIGHLY, convenient, partly because that part of the city had an unusually low level of traffic, even during rush hour (again, I'm drawing from my less than stellar experiences driving in Boston and New York.) I was able to easily breeze in and out of the city during all hours, making it a true pleasure to explore the region. Again, my only complaint was the wifi, and considering it was provided by AT&T that should be of absolutely no surprise to anyone. I kid... maybe.

There is valet parking, but with a weekend rate of $99, it's a real treat to stay in such a nice hotel. The rooms are very large, and they are super quiet, with large bathrooms and comfy chairs or a sofa with a big flatscreen...we'll what's not to love? There is a great restaurant in the hotel, but there are other options within walking distance. One could walk to the Kennedy site at Dealy Plaza and catch the Dart Train to the fabulous art museum or new fine arts area. We are loyal members of a national chain, but we spice up our travels with stay in unique, lovely hotels or bed and breakfasts.

I am glad that these two hooks initially drew me there because our stay at The Adophus on Friday, Saturday, and Sunday was wonderful! The hotel is located in the downtown and is a short walk or drive to the major sites, attractions, and restaurants in the Dallas area. A car rental agency is located on the corner next to The Adolphus and connects to the hotel's garage, which provided easy access for rental, parking, and return of the vehicle used during our stay. Upon my arrival, the hotel's bell captain was very helpful and open regarding the lay of the land in downtown Dallas...a tremendous fellow. The front desk staff were very friendly to my family and me during the entire stay. The food at the hotel's restaurants and a connecting steak house was excellent as was the service provided at these establishments and by the hotel's room service staff. Had we wanted to do so, we would never have needed to leave the hotel for dining because the food was that good. We were only sorry that we were unable to dine at the 5-star French restaurant that was located in The Adolphus...perhaps on another visit. I was most impressed, however, with members of the concierge staff who went above and beyond the call of duty in terms of friendliness and professionalism toward my family. After checking out of our room on Sunday, we decided to wait in one of the beautiful lobbies of The Adolphus for a late afternoon flight. It must have been fairly obvious what we were doing because one of the members of the concierge staff asked us if we would like to tour the magnificient old structure. He gave my family and me anywhere from 45 minutes to 1 hour of his time as he took us to various parts of The Adophus and provided an excellent history of the hotel's construction and its varied occupants. It was that sort of friendliness and professionalism during our stay that drove me to write my first-ever review for TripAdvisor and which drives me to recommend The Adolphus as a sure bet for a wonderful stay in Dallas.", "Date": "June 19, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cWonderful hotel!\u201d", "Author": "Scott3709", "ReviewID": "UR114377393", "Content": "This hotel has such history and is so beautiful.

The Adolphus was a great way to leave the family drama behind! The previous review complained about the size of the room assigned and, although we did not measure the room, I would concur that the size was probably less than advertised. However the entrance hall and bathroom added about 200 square feet....bringing the total footage closer to the advertisement. The good things: beautiful historic public areas, spacious bathroom with good counter height, fantastic bed and quality linens. The bed was truly one of the best. And if I was asked to rate only the bed, I'd give it five stars. The room was quiet despite a lot of partying going on in the hotel. We also never heard any street noise nor any noise from parties on the terraces of the newer rooms below. Valet was very quick...but expensive. Bad things: Bleach smell so strong upon check-in that we had to leave. (4 hours later the smell had dissipated). There were long black hairs in the tub and some shampoo residue in the tub. I almost think the toilet and floors had been cleaned but the tub had been forgotten! There was only one packet of decaf coffee in the room....something we did not discover until the morning. So we went to Starbuck's at the Magnolia next door to get our coffee. Only one TV in suite which was located in the sitting area and it was 20-30 ft away from the bed. Furnishings were slightly worn...but this suite was located in the oldest part of the building. Windows did not open...which was OK since it was 100 degrees outside! There were lots of wedding parties at the hotel on the particular weekend we were at the Adophus. The Adolphus staff can't be held responsible for the bad behavior of some of their guests and I only mention this because I imagine the weekend guests are quite different from the weekday guests. I doubt that you will see obviously drunk guests in the bar and public areas of the hotel in the middle of the week. In conclusion, I's say the very special rate was worth the services received.

We had to switch rooms shortly after check-in due to not being in side-by-side rooms as requested upon booking. After switching, we reminded them again about the rollaways and again were told that they'd be up shortly. After returning from lunch and shopping later in the day, we still did not have rollaways in either room. We reminded them yet again - at this point we had asked for them 4 times - and once more were told they'd be in the room very soon. When we left for dinner and an evening out, we still had nothing in the room (and no phone calls explaining the delay). When we returned to the hotel at the end of the evening, we were told that there were no rollaways available in the entire hotel - they were all being used. The front desk clerk was unwilling to let us speak to management and claimed that the hotel was 100% booked and no additional rooms were available. When we went down to speak with her in person, 5 other gentlemen were in the lobby with the same problem - promised rollaway beds to accommodate their party, and now being told to sleep on the floor. The front desk clerk chose to stand in the middle of the lobby and shout at everyone, rather than stepping behind the desk like a staff member of a 4 star hotel and dealing with the numerous unhappy customers professionally. Furthermore, she informed us (again - there were 7-8 people down there at this point, all upset about not having rollaway beds) that we were all \"out to screw her.\" When we finally spoke with management the next morning, they made excuses for the behavior of their employees and made absolutely no effort to correct their mistakes. At the ridiculous prices customers pay to stay in this hotel, in addition to the $24/day parking charge, the treatment we received was unnacceptable. We were paying for 4 star service and we absolutely did not get it - one of the gentlemen in the lobby commented that we may as well have stayed at a Motel 6, considering the way this hotel treats their customers.

The 19th floor is said to be haunted so of course we got a suite on the 19th floor. The staff was beyond friendly, the rooms were nice with a fun view of the skyline, the hotel was within walking distance of everything (although they continually offered the hotel car...it was just too nice outside). They went out of their way to be friendly to all of us and catered to our every need. Now to the \"haunted floor\". One evening after a few cocktails we headed back to the hotel room in the wee hours of the morning while two of our friends lagged behind. A few minutes later we heard the squealing down the hall. They ran into the room and said once they got off the elevator, the phone started ringing in the 19th floor waiting area and all of the elevator doors started opening and closing with no explanation. Of course we all ran out in our pj's and waited by the elevators patiently. A few minutes later, all of the elevator doors started to open and close again and the phone began to ring. It took a few instances of this before we finally answered the phone, which had a very Vincent-Price-type-laugh on the other side. We exploded in quiet laughter (there were guests staying there of course). We later went to the lobby and all of the staff greeted us with big smiles and asked how our evening was going. The entire trip the hotel was fantastic, but I really was surprised and appreciated they that took the time to give us ladies a late night show.

I ran the Rock & Roll half marathon in Dallas last year and the Adolphus is a few blocks from the start line. Last year, the hotel was very accommodating with offers of late check-out and opening up breakfast (bagels, fruit, water, sports drinks, granola bars, etc.) for purchase very early. The staff was great and I've since stayed at the hotel for other occasions downtown. This year, I wanted to repeat the fantastic experience from last year and I was sorely disappointed. When I checked in, I asked about late check-out and was told that a large group was arriving, so I couldn't be accommodated. That would have been fine, but the group checking in next to me asked for a late check-out and was told \"sure!\" I inquired about breakfast offerings for race-goers and was told flatly, \"Breakfast is served from 6:30 to 10.\" I told the guy checking me in that I wanted to know if the hotel would be offering the same set-up that was offered the year prior. He flatly replied, \"Breakfast is served from 6:30 to 10.\" Then he handed me my key with no offer to get a bell hop to assist with my bags. While I don't mind carrying my own bags, having a bell hop carry your bags to your room is one of the services that the hotel offers and the friendly clerk checking in his group offered it as I was walking away. I had reserved and paid for a king sized room. When I got to my room, it had a double bed. These rooms are less expensive than the room I paid for, so I called the front desk to inquire about changing rooms. The same desk clerk who checked me in answered the phone, asked my room number a few times while he fumbled around, put me on hold, then came back on and asked for my room number again. The hotel has a system that displays the guest name and room number to the person who answers the phone (like most hotels of this caliber) so I'm not sure why I had to give the room number, my name and my issue more than once. Finally, after a great deal of silence, he said, \"John will be up to your room in a minute.\" (Note, there was no apology for issuing me a different room than I had paid for.) When John got to my room, he was very nice- he carried my bags and made pleasant conversation, suggested less-crowded dinner options and made sure that I was happy with the new room. John (and everyone else I encountered after that) was great. I went to dinner with some fellow race-goers and when I came back, I noticed that a new crew was working the front desk. I called the front desk to ask about a late check-out and this time I was greeted by name and told immediately that my check-out had been extended until 1pm. I also had to call the front desk later to request an extra pillow and some silverware. Everyone was so nice, but that only made the first desk clerk that I dealt with seem all the more out of place. I wrote an email to the hotel explaining my frustrations with the first desk clerk, but praising the hotel for all of the other employees. I never heard anything back even though I had requested to be contacted and left a valid mailing address, phone number and e-mail. My room was almost $300 for a night in a city I live in, so I had high expectations of the level of service and unfortunately, one employee with a poor attitude ruined it for me. I don't know if I will stay in this hotel again. It's a charming hotel and most of the rooms are different. The beds are comfortable, although the tv in most rooms is far away from the bed. Room service is great and will meet all of your requests and service is usually prompt and extremely friendly.

Old, worn carpeting, old bathrooms with shower/tub combos and outdated bathroom fixtures, no safes, no minibars, dated carpeting and draperies, old furniture, and there are no hallways into the room (e.g. doors open right into the room) so there is no privacy and light from the hallways leak through the crack in the door.

Since we were on the 21st floor, we heard no traffic noise. My only real complaint was that we had to pay over $50 for a taxi to and from the airport. You can pay less with a shuttle, but it takes an hour with stops.

Families are welcomed beginning on Friday afternoon. Our check-in experience was smooth and handled quickly. My grandchildren found Christmas cookies and milk waiting in our room. The more casual restaurant was geared completely for familes: kid-friendly menu, buckets of peanuts to enjoy while tossing the shells on the floor (one child's favorite memory!), with a wait staff who never stopped moving in their efficient effort to serve large extended family groups. We had stopped by after checking in to ask about getting a reservation; when we arrived for dinner at the time we had mentioned, we found a table reserved with our name on it! The Adolphus is within easy walking distance of the famous Neiman Marcus window display as well as a park area with fountains and room to run. Families gather near the beautifully decorated tree in the hotel lobby for pictures and conversation; children play in their Christmas pj's. The housekeeping staff is attuned to guests' every need. As we were approaching our room, my husband casually mentioned that we might need more towels and coffee for the in-room coffee maker. Unaware that anyone else had heard our discussion, we were amazed when a housekeeper knocked on the door moments later with the items! The Saturday morning parade is magical for everyone, and to be at the center of the activity is a treat. We met Santa in the elevator and talked to elves and costumed parade participants in the lobby.

The floors are uneven throughout the property, and the amenities are aged. Could work in London or Paris, but I don't think it is a North American type. After waiting for a month for the mileage to be credited to my airline account, I checked with the hotel, and they told me, after I was told by everyone that I would get miles, that since it was a prepaid sale, no airline points will be awarded, and that they award miles only to specific rates and dates, and it is all arbitrary and their decision is final.

Parking is quite expensive ($24/night), as it is usually is any big city, but there are public parking lots within walking distance if you want an alternate. Checking in was painless, but our complaint about the lack of cold water was not necessarily taken seriously by the front desk on our first night of our stay. I would guess the usually the complaint is lack of hot water, but this was a serious lack of COLD water - even the toilet emitted a heat! Other guests we spoke to also had the same issue, so it wasn't just our floor or room. If the hotel hasn't fixed it yet - visitor beware!! You do *NOT* want to scald yourself in the shower, washing your hands or brushing your teeth! We found that wasting water, by letting it run for about 15 minute, will cool the water down in the shower, when the setting is set on the coldest possible. Upon our checkout the front desk took note of our concern again (it was supposed to be addressed by the staff the day before), so I hope it really will be taken care of before somebody accidentally scalds themselves. Another thing to be aware of is that although there is internet access (AT&T), take note it is not speedy. At all. I think it may have been slower than dial-up, and I honestly don't know why as I did not inquire about it with the hotel staff. However, if you're on vacation, maybe it's best to stay unplugged and enjoy the sights of Dallas. If you need it, there is a 24 hour business center, although we opted not to use it. I would recommend this hotel if you are looking for a great location, but be sure to know that it does have it's quirks! It is also a classy, elegant & historic location and I would imagine a great place to get married, or to host any sort of celebration.

The bed was extremely comfortable and the room layout was pleasant, even though I had a view of a large air shaft. There were 2 closets with mirrored doors, a nice size bathroom with tub/shower combo, a sitting area, and a desk and TV. The ventilation system was not well filtered. The last 2 nights I was awakened at 2am by noisy guests in the hall outside my room. Others in my group (on different floors) had complained about the noise earlier in the week. The common areas are beautiful!

The pillows were super soft, I mean barely support your head, so if you stay make sure to ask for a bunch of extra pillows if you like support. Also for being a 5-star hotel, the television was a 27\" tube tv that was way across the room. So at night when we were trying to relax it was hard to watch. They billed free wifi but it took a good 10 min to just load google.

The room was quite large, exceeded my expectations. the TC was a flat CRT and very far from the bed assuming you watch TV in bed. The bed was comfortable, pillows were a more foam than feather, rather hot at night. The AC points away from the bed so circulation of air where you sleep is needed. I kept the temperature around 66 to remain comfortable. The bathroom had a tub, a bit off color an old. The sink was chipped and is inside a cubby so it's hard to blow dry your hair next to the mirror without smashing your elbows in the two sides. I'm only 6'1\". The door to the room while closed lets lots of light in and luckily it wasn't noisy.

We then had a 3 course meal for 11 people at the French Room and everything was delicious. I had the beef tenderloin, which practically melted in my mouth. Most people ordered the salmon, which the man next to me declared to be the best thing he had ever eaten. The service in the French room was outstanding.

The room was old world beautiful, but the lighting in both the room and the bathroom was very poor. I had to turn on the heat lamp in the bathroom to get adequate lighting to see to apply makeup. Many of the individual lamps in the room did not work. The bed bowed in the middle once you laid on it (not supportive), which also meant that the flat sheet on the bottom was quickly coming off the bed.

As we approached the elevator, a maid asked \"what room are ya'll checking out of?\" I told her we were not checking out. She said \"Ok, just trying to turn the rooms for the next group you know\". Someone should tell her a bit of friendly conversation and then a polite inquiry as to whether we were checking out would have given her the same information she wanted without seeming that we needed to leave so she could get her job done. After breakfast, we went back to the room to get ready to check out. The plaque on the door said checkout was 1pm. At 9:55 the phone rang, it was maid service checking to see if we were still there or could they come clean the room. I answered that obviously, we were still there. Keep in mind that the \"do not disturb\" sign was still on our door, had they checked. The service at the restaurants was 5 star. Unfortunately, the service at the hotel itself doesn't come close.

When staying at a historic property, know that some modern amenities you usually take for granted will be absent, and that old things tend to break. The Adolphus has no in-room safes, no ice or soda dispensers, tiny bathrooms, and small, ancient picture-tube TVs which are hard to visualize from across the spacious room, and cannot be used to access your statement or check out electronically. Air conditioning is primitive and loud. Wireless internet is available (and free!), but signal strength is spotty at best. The hotel was built small (by Adolph Busch, the Budweiser guy) and then added onto, multiple times - which means the magnificent lobby is on 3 separate levels; and you can't go from some of the conference and ballroom areas to others on the same floor without going down a flight of stairs, crossing the lobby, and going up another stairway. This is annoying during a conference, and I suspect more so at a wedding reception. (This is the first choice for every Dallas wedding reception of any stature, apparently.) All of that said, the Adolphus is the place to stay if you must spend the night in Dallas. It reeks of old-world history, prices are reasonable, and the service is superb. No other vintage hotel that I know of, with the possible exception of the legendary Palace in San Francisco, has been as lovingly restored and preserved. This is what it must have been like to stay in a first-class hotel in the early 20th century. The main restaurant, called the French Room, is also excellent, with a well-chosen and fairly-priced wine list. Portions, however, are what my wife calls \"nouvelle/no food\" -- artfully arranged, but way too small for most American (and particularly Texan) preferences. Two of my three major hotel pet peeves must also be mentioned: valet parking is outrageously priced -- why do hotels feel entitled to charge so much to park your car? (There is, however, a public garage 2 blocks down.) And they have in-room \"mini-bars\", which I consider an insult on general principle. Here, the prices are not only ridiculous, but they actually tack on a 20% \"restocking charge\" as well! (Do they think we're stupid? Or do alcoholics simply not care what alcohol costs?) Internet access (my 3rd peeve) is available and free, as mentioned above, but the signal is weak. I understand the problems of wireless internet in an old building, but it wouldn't cost much to install a few extra wireless transmitters. In short, like a '57 Chevy, the good aspects outweigh the bad, in my opinion -- as long as you know and accept the inherent limitations of vintage equipment.", "Date": "June 28, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "New Orleans, Louisiana", "Title": "\u201cThe food, service, and decor of the French Room are second to none!\u201d", "Author": "LSUTIGER_NOLA", "ReviewID": "UR68863059", "Content": "The Adolphus is a nice hotel with an incredible staff.

The room was breathtaking with a separate living room and a huge patio overlooking downtown Dallas. After unpacking we went down to the Rodeo Bar for lunch. We were not disappointed here either. The prices were very reasonable and the food was delicious. We both had the pulled pork sandwich and highly recommend it. That evening we went to the French Room for dinner. At $80 a person, we were a little hesitant to dine here, but all of our doubts quickly diminished. We were treated like royalty from the moment we arrived and truly felt like we were the only ones in the restaurant. I am a very picky eater and was worried about the menu items were not of the norm, but everything was incredible. I don't eat fish but my husband had me try his and even it was unbelievable. I highly suggest this restaurant if you are celebrating anything special or are just looking for a romantic night out.

However, this stay at the Adolphus was definitely a departure from the normal, hum drum accommodations we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re used to. For this type of event we normally stay at a Holiday Inn, Fairfield Inn and those types of hotels, which are fine. We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve been confortable and have had no complaints. However I was very pleased when I stepped into the lobby of the Adolphus. Now I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m a very modern girl. Like things to be new and modern. Wouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t normally go for anything old fashioned. But surprisingly I enjoyed the historical d\u00c3\u00a9cor of the Adolphus very much. I read a plaque on the building that said the hotel was built in 1911 by Adolphus Busch, co founder of Anheuser- Busch. Much of the original d\u00c3\u00a9cor and architecture remains, from the lobby to the rooms. The rooms vary as well. They are not all the same in layout and size. Because we were with a group I got to see a couple of different rooms. My room was on the smaller side, having a long hallway leading to the sleeping area. The desk was in this hallway. The sleeping area had two double beds with posters, but the bedding was very comfortable. We slept like a dream. The bathroom was huge. Large wardrobe housed the flat screen tv and some drawers. There was a mini bar as well as a small coffee maker in the room as well. Also the closet was HUGE. Like a walk in closet. However there were a couple of small negatives. Nothing major. First, as I said the bathroom was huge and was consistent with the historical d\u00c3\u00a9cor. The floor had a piece of some sort of sticky gum or something on it. It kind of blended in with the floor and was off to the side so may not have been seen by housekeeping. But they should mop the ENTIRE floor. Also, the shower wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t my favorite. It had an old fashioned shower head where the water only went straight down. You had to stand right underneath it. Not a lot of pressure either. The appearance of the shower was very nice with slate wall tiles, however. The other negative is that after our first night there, we got up early and went to the competition and didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t return until about 3. When we walked in we saw that the room hadn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t been cleaned yet. I was quite annoyed about this because I wanted to come to the room to rest because we had a busy morning. They didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t come until 3:30. I left the room so they could clean and came back to get my jacket to go outside about 15 mins later and she was already done. I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t think they vacuum daily. The room seemed clean, though. Also, the walls must be paper thin. I think the first night the room next door may have been empty, but the 2nd morning we could hear a VERY loud, unpleasant conversation, complete with profanity, going on next door. I think it was a phone conversation because I could only hear one voice. When I walked to the adjoining door I could hear the conversation clear as day. The Rodeo Bar & Grill had great burgers and is only open for lunch and dinner. There is another, much more expensive restaurant on the premises as well that serves breakfast. Overall, it was a good experience and I really enjoyed the different atmosphere from the usual hotel we stay in. It was like going back in time. Also, we got a very group rate of $99 per night which I was very surprised about. I would have thought they would charge much more, so it seems the rates are pretty reasonable.

We were offered a awesome rate to stay overnight, and we thought, hey why not. A chance to stay at the wonderful Adolphus. I could certainly tell they had crammed a lot of events into this hotel for one evening. People in every nook and cranny. The hotel is indeed beautiful and charming and it was decorated to the hilt for the season. The halls of the hotel are the largest hallways I have every seen and extremely well lit all night long. Our room was very large. It had a couch, arm chair, coffee tables, desk and chair, king size bed. The view from the 8th floor onto Main Street was decent. Downtown has become alive again after many years of nothing to do down there. We enjoyed watching people from our birds eye view. The bathroom was plenty big. The TV was kind of tiny, but we were not there to watch TV. We retired early, around 10PM, and that's where the evening went downhill. The guests across the hall from us had evidently booked their room for a party. It started around 10:30. People coming and going and loud music and noise. People banging on the metal door to gain entrance to the hoopla, metal door slamming shut very loudly, over and over and over again. Around midnight i could not stand it any longer so I called the front desk. No answer, no connection, out of order signals. I called every extension I could find on the phone, nothing worked. I stuffed some pillows up against the door. Turned the air to run constantly on the heater (which was actually pretty loud) it helped to drown out most of the noise. But not really, until 3:30AM when I heard the loud mouthed hostess screaming for someone to get out and go home. Oh my. What a night! I wanted to get up in the morning and tour the hotel and maybe walk around downtown but I was pretty exhausted. I did let the front desk know of the situation as I checked out. And one last note. Be sure and check your CC the next few days after your stay. I was charged for the over priced minibar that I absolutely did not touch. I was told they would adjust this error. I realize that it is not the hotels fault for the inconsiderate guests across from our room, but I am more concerned that the phone systems was not working. What if we had a emergency ?

(we stayed in standard rooms). The beds were luxurious and very comfortable. The biggest downside to the bedrooms is the lighting - not unusual in hotel rooms everywhere - but in my room there wasn't one mirror in the bedroom, no overhead lighting anywhere, only table lamps. In the bathroom there was one small shaving/make-up mirror with nowhere to put anything. The shower was adequate but not overwhelming. And no in-room safe. The other complaint we had was that so many of the amenities in the public areas were closed. On only two days of our stay were we able to get a drink (of any kind) in the lovely lounge area, the Bistro restaurant, which served a very good, (reasonably priced)breakfast was closed at all other times of the day. The only place to eat or drink most of the time, is the Rodeo Bar downstairs, which is not 5-star standard. If you want a slick, modern hotel, don't stay here. But if you appreciate the old-time grandeur and courtesy of staff, there is much to appreciate at this hotel. It is in the commercial area, so not much going on in the immediate vicinity, but public transport via the new DART system is very good, and the hotel has a courtesy limousine which will take you anywhere within a 5 mile radius of the hotel.

I stayed there for 5 days recently and was initially so excited to check in, since I heard that it was THE hotel in town and had the best service. I was in Dallas with my ailing Mother (this trip was a surprise vaction for her) and I contacted the concierge, who we'll call \"D.O\", just about a month prior to our check-in to explain the significance of the trip and to request a few simple room requests, which D.O assured me would be taken care of. These requests included a nice room on the highest floor possible with a view, and a welcome note for my Mom to be placed in the room. Pretty simple requests right? Especially for a concierge service that, according to their website, is \"in the best European tradition\". I even sent D.O an email 48hrs before our arrival re-confirming the requests, and was told that everything was ready to go. Well, you guessed it, we arrive at the hotel at about 9:30pm on our check-in day (I told D.O we would be there at around 10:00pm) and NOTHING is ready. We get a dark, cramped room on a mid-level floor, with absolutely no view and no welcome note to be found. Furious at the incompetence of D.O and tired from travelling all day, I headed back to the front desk to see how this could have happened at the Adolphus, where again, according to their site, all guests \"are considered royalty\". A gentleman named Paul listened to my story, and after confirming on his computer that D.O had left NO notes regarding our visit to anyone else, Paul took matters into his own hands like a true professional and saved me from heading right out of the Adolphus forever. Paul got us into a much larger, higher, brighter room, with a beautiful view of the city and had some wine, cheese and a welcome note sent up as my Mom and I stepped out for a coffee. This was really appreciated Paul. The next evening, Paul had a beautiful bouquet of flowers sent up for my Mom. Finally, some world-class service, I thought. So, despite the pathetic concierge service by D.O, Paul really made our stay enjoyable. Two other employees are real stars as well. Gerald at the front door was SO friendly and really took care of us. Thanks for representing Gerald (and sorry again about the bad bbq comments!:). And John at the belldesk was excellent as well. Be sure to talk to John after you return from the Kennedy 6th Floor Museum for some great storytelling! Really enjoyed meeting you John. Thanks for your hospitality! I am recommending the Adolphus only because these three individuals stepped up to the plate and gave the service that one should expect there. I HIGHLY encourage anyone who's thinking of staying at the Adolphus to search out these three people if you need something done right. They will take care of you MUCH better than D.O. Oh, and be sure to bring your own umbrellas too. I had to get a manager on the phone to demand one after being told by Ryan at the belldesk that \"budget cuts\" and \"other guests not returning them\" had depleted their stock. Ryan then suggested that I go to the hotel giftshop and \"buy one\". What???? How many stars does this hotel have???? Buy an umbrella???? There were several times when I sure didn't feel like \"royalty\".

I know i sound cheap, but for me, i can get my own ice for free thanks. Oh, and dont think those bottles of shampoo and soap are free, if you read the fine print, they'll charge you 15$ for those! Come on, they're free at even the ceapest hotels. I was afraid to flush the toilet for fear of being charged for water(j/k).

For one person, I thought I had been misplaced. The room was a suite. I think it would've been better if I wasn't paranoid and actually stayed with someone else. Being alone in the huge room styled in the olden days was ..to sum it up in one word..creepy. Three of my colleagues and I were down at the bar discussing the rooms. We are three ladies, traveling alone and each in our own rooms. We were all talking about how creepy the rooms are and how we each may be sleeping with the lights and tv on. I heard noises at times....it all sounded like people running up and down the halls either above me or outside of my door. There were never any voices, just running footsteps. This happened a few times, and it never lasted very long. There are mirrors above the beds that serve no purpose. It's not like you can do your makeup in the mirrors. They are old, and they make the things in the room look strange. There is also a normal mirror in the bathroom and then on both sides, there are two mirrors with candle looking lights in front of it. These are the lights for the bathroom. The mirrors are not something you can see yourself in. It's just really strange. If you like the old feel, this may be the place for you. On the up side, the staff is extremely nice and very willing to help!!! The maid service, the front desk, the concierge, the valet, doormen, restaurant staff, all EXCELLENT! If I hadn't been alone, I may have given this another notch. Location of hotel--it's in the business district, so if you're near here on the weekend...most things are closed. Be very careful is you're walking alone..lots of homeless people and some are straight up crazy! There is a police station and a jail in walking distance too.

The receptionist could see we were very tired and our check in was a breeze. We were informed the breakfast room was just about ready to open so we went to our room dumped our belongings, washed our face and down for breakfast. Again service here was fast,friendly and efficient. We had had nothing decent to eat for the best part of 12 hours [do not fly wth American Airlines] and breakfast was just what we needed. The staff were so friendly it was a delight to eat here in the morning. Breakfast was also very good. Upstairs we caught a few hours sleep and by 11am we were ready to face Dallas. And what and absolutely fantastic city this is. Friendly locals, a great transport system[so cheap] good restaurants - the little italian place behind the hotel is really good- ask for Jorg and Milano the owner- they will keep you right and do try the Mona Lisa salad-FAB! Brilliant museums within walking distance of this hotel not forgetting JFK memorial and of course the 6th floor museum where the fatal shot was fired from, but another museum that should be top of your list is the Holocaust museum. This museum was founded by Mike Jacobs a living survivor of the Holocaust and it is not to be missed. My husband found it upsetting and whilst so did I, my overriding thought was of the people who perished and what they must have sufferded at the hands of the Nazis, I felt I owed it to them to finish my tour of this mueum. I don't know what my feeling were when I came out, sadness I think, but I am glad I visited it. Back to the hotel and the staff. I have never encountered such friendly, couldn't do enough for us staff, than what we encountered in this hotel. The male concierge let us into the French room to take photos, the female concierge made enquiries about a visit to Southfork and supplied telephone numbers, [and asked how we got on when we came back], the porter told us where to go shopping and another one helped us with the phone system. Another one told us about the history of the hotel and when our Queen and the Duke of Edinburgh used this hotel back in the nineties. There is a photograph and plaque of the Royals in the lobby. This is truly a magnificent hotel, where the staff are very proud of it and its reputation. They are obviously very happy in the hotel, as I spoke to members of staff who had been there for 20 and almost 30 years. Rooms are well equipped and very comfortable.

I am always attracted to romantic, historical hotels and always try to at least check them out when I'm in a given town. Upon arriving here, the valets treated me like royalty and helped me carry my bags and were only too happy to help, even when I didn't have any cash readily available for a tip. They seemed genuinely happy to make my two night stay as wonderful as possible. When I saw the gorgeous and super elegant lobby and common areas at check-in, I knew I had arrived! The front desk staff was as deferential and helpful as the valets and my check-in was problem free from the get-go. The room was meticulously clean and beautiful, not to mention huge, a whopping 550 sq. feet and it was only the deluxe, not superior room. The bathroom was elegantly up to date and very tastefully decorated in a tuscany, Italian marble theme. The rooms are appointed with antique lamps that look like cloisonne/Asian vases and I couldn't have felt more comfortable. Though the hotel dates from 1912, the electrical outlets work very well, unlike with some historic hotels and though I can't speak for the wi-fi or internet hook-up performance, everything worked!!! I ordered several room service items and they came promptly and the servers were very courteous and bent over backwards to please. I have to be honest, I had some trepidation in booking this hotel, as I had read many neg. reviews regarding the thin walls and \"lack of privacy\" due to poor insulation. Well, I am the original light sleeper and was prepared for hearing sounds of amourous couples, loud tvs and terrible street noise on Akard Street. I have to say that I spent two very quiet nights at the hotel, despite an apparent near full capacity. There was a girl's pre-wedding event going on and I thought, oh no, lots of partying into the night and noise. AGAIN, I didn't hear a thing from anyone, it seemed that no one else was even on my floor; though there appeared to be lots of cars in the garage. I have to say that this was a spectacular experience and you have to stay here at least once. Some nuttos who h ave reviewed this place, have said that it is dated and worn. Not only am I a light sleeper, I am also a hotel snob, and believe you me, this place is a tour de force; I have stayed in the world's best hotels and this one is near the top of the list. Elegance, courtesy, and an alluring history make this a wonderful place to stay. I got a tremendous deal on Expedia and would recommend that you check there for excellent package rates (I paid $205 for a three day car rental AND two nights at this hotel), you can't beat that. I was charged $48 for two days of parking my car ($24 per day), but they did NOT charge me extra hundreds of $ on my debit card, as others have said. There is an $80 per day \"incidental expenses\" charge which I didn't like, but apparently, since I prepaid the room, they did not actually charge me, go figure. John, the concierge is a wonderful asset to the hotel and I just can't say enough about my experience here. If this place is good enough for Donald Trump and Queen Elizabeth, believe me, you won't feel any less special here! AWESOME EXPERIENCE. P.S. I did not get a chance to dine at the French Room, as it was closed on the days I was there (closed on Sundays and Mondays). I will be sure to hit it up next trip.

I was concerned that it wouldn't be special enough for the first part of our honeymoon and believed that we should splurge a little more at the Joule. However, I was pleasently suprised from the moment we left the check-in desk and went up the escalator! First of all, the lobby was much larger than Joule's and more impressive! It defined elegance with the dark wooden antique furniture and mirrors. Then I was happy to find that our room was at the corner of the building and was VERY spacious. What I didn't see in other's photos was how these rooms had huge windows lined up with a beautiful view of Dallas. The bathroom was roomy as well and decorated as nicely as our room. I can hear the television from inside of this bathroom with the speakers. We had a very delicious breakfast at their classy bistro. I recommend their chicken and mushroom sausage. We will return later to try out their legendary, but pricey French Room. Overall, this place looks better in person and it is close to the more impressive side of downtown Dallas where you are down the street from Neiman Marcus and some surrounding flourishing restaurants and businesses. I personally recommend the Dallas Fish Market across the street and will check out Charlie Palmer at the Joule next time. I also recommend visitors to go to the Urban Market for a delicious lunch and for snack runs at their grocery section. I would also stroll a bit further down to the Dallas Museum of Art and ride the old street cars to uptown just to make a good day out of your stay.

The hotel was very helpful when the airline temporarily lost one of my cases and made sure it was returned to me safely. One bellman in particular, who I believe may be the one noted in other reviews, was especially sweet, chatting to me and helping me out a lot.

I was on around the 14th floor I think, definitely quite high, and I didn't experience this. There may have been some noise through the windows but as I live on a main road back home in England I'm so accustomed to the noise of traffic and people at night that I don't really notice. It was certainly not distracting and did not affect my sleep at all. Room service food was pricey but this is true of many hotels and I only needed to use it once during my week long stay. The food was warming and hearty, and the lady who brought it was very polite. We ate once in the dining room (not the French room or the Rodeo Bar) and the food was fine. Overall I had a lovely stay. My room did not have a musty smell, and was bright and clean.

The staff is professional but shows that famous Texan hospitality and are always available. My bedroom was gorgeous and roomy. Meeting rooms were comfortable (the interior rooms were a little dark since there were no windows). Complimentary wireless in the lobby and throughout the hotel (oddly enough, we did have to pay for a connection in our onsite work office). Room rates were very reasonable. I hope to come back to The Adolphus many more times - not just for work but for pleasure.

Cons - I was charged for items from the mini bar when I didn't use anything - I couldn't get it resolved because the direct line to the hotel constantly gave a busy signal. Valet parking is $20/day plus tip and I had to go out to the garage to get my car - I thought the idea was they brought the car to the front to you. This is pretty much the going rate for parking, but it adds up as part of the total stay price. Most of the restaurants in that area only offer lunch service, such as Jason's Deli and Galilee. Unless you are looking for a $30+ sit down meal, there aren't many options. The Interurban cafe and Campisi's were the best options.

The shower was hot with good pressure. I especially took note of how quiet the room was.

The service was friendly yet perfectly efficient. I commend them for not jumping on the wasteful, poor-quality breakfast buffet bandwagon. I would much rather sit and order something than graze. I didn't eat in their fine dining room but from looking at the menu, peeking in the room and reading reviews it looks like it actually may be a place worth having a $100 meal.

The hotel has a rich history, and it used to be downright fancy; however, its charm and reputation just weren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t enough to keep me, and I wouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t return. We booked the hotel through AmEx\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Fine Hotels and Resorts program, and this property is one that they should definitely drop from the list. The Adolphus has several things going for it: It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s in the heart of downtown; it offers a variety of room sizes/categories; it has a pleasant staff; the rooms are pretty cheaply priced; it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s purported to have the finest dining of any hotel in America (at the French room). Oh, and the Queen once stayed there. The hotel is very proud of this fact (her picture hangs in the lobby), and I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be she enjoyed her stay many years ago. Unfortunately, I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t think the property has been updated one bit since then, so the hotel\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s royal appointment doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t really matter anymore. We booked into a junior suite, which was nicely sized \u00e2\u20ac\u201c although really just one big room. The first room we took smelled of cigarette smoke, so we asked to be moved. The front desk was happy to oblige, and we moved to another junior suite with a completely different layout. It was smoke free, but it had a definite mustiness to it. The d\u00c3\u00a9cor of the room had a stuffy charm, but it also smacked of a fancy hotel from the late 1970s. It just didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t appeal to me. Even though it was clean and in pretty-good condition, I got the feeling that the furniture was well used, and it all just seemed old. The bathroom was decent sized and had marble surfaces for floors, counters, and the combination shower/bath. All fixtures were of good quality but, like the rest of the room, looked too old. The room had two televisions, which were concealed in armoires. Because we were in town to attend wedding festivities, we dropped off our bags, cranked down the a/c, and left for dinner. When we returned, we noticed that the room was not much cooler than when we checked in, and it felt quite muggy inside. Too tired to think about moving to another room, we turned in. At about 2 a.m., I awoke with a sore throat and a congested head. The air conditioner had been running nonstop, and the room had grown muggier without cooling down any. The air coming out of the vents felt so damp, and I could only imagine the mold spores that we must have been breathing. A few minutes later, rain began to fall outside, and I started hearing a dripping sound. One of the windows, which didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t open, was taking in water so fast that a pool had formed on the marble ledge and was overflowing down to the carpet. At that point, I jumped on to the complimentary wireless internet connection and booked another room at the W hotel. The front desk was concerned that we were leaving early, and they wanted to move us to a better room.

We loved the Adolphus and would definitely recommend it for travelers who appreciate nice digs and full service. It's on Commerce, so it's in an older part of downtown--the old original urban core, I take it, so there are some characters on the street, for sure (doesn't bother us-we live i downtown Houston). The hotel is really lovely with tons of charm--old paneling and woodwork in the huge lobby, and they even do afternoon tea (no kidding--people make a special point of coming for it. It's as beautiful a hotel lobby as you'll ever see. Again, \"gracious\" is the world I'd use). It's an older hotel so it's not as perfectly tip top as the Westin--it has seen more mileage--but it's in a great old building and the rooms are fine--large, with monogrammed linens and very nice travertine bathroom. And, after all, for many years it has been \"the\" place to stay in Dallas--everyone from European royalty to U2 has stayed there. The staff was maybe the most gracious I have ever encountered in any hotel--I mean, the people cleaning the rooms have their hair done and are wearing jewelry. The Magnolia, which I have not stayed in, is next door, and has a Starbuck's in the ground floor which is very nice to know about, since I'm a muffin and latte sort of person. We did not eat at the famous French Room at the Adolphus which is apparently the highest rated hotel restaurant in the country. We didn't hang out at Walt Garrison's Bar and Grill either on the ground floor, but they serve nuts in a shell in a bucket and your throw your shells on the floor--yee haw!

I have already done a review with hotel management so I will write most of that here. My wife and I recently spent the weekend at the hotel. We had planned on having a nice retreat away from the house, we live in the North Dallas area. We checked in at approximately 4 o'clock in the afternoon without difficulty. I then discovered that my wife had called ahead and asked for chocolate covered strawberries to be delivered to our room and build to our room prior to our arrival. She called a couple of days ahead and asked for that to be delivered or around 330. Unfortunately it was not in the room when we arrived. Approximately 1 hour later and two telephone calls later to room service the strawberries arrived. We did call and they did say that they were very busy however I think that if you plan ahead this wouldn't have been something that would have been very difficult to do. In addition they do charge a pretty substantial amount of money for the cost and delivery of these so I wouldn't think it would be very difficult to accomplish that. Next we did have a dinner at the French room. I will try to write a separate review of the French room but this was the best part of the trip. I am trying to write this review about only the hotel. The restaurant was great we had an excellent dinner we enjoyed our waiter and all of the staff. To go back to the room, we had upgraded to a suite. Andunfortunately this hotel is quite old. They do not seem to have renovated their rooms in some time. The furniture was quite dated and in actuality the chair and Ottoman next to the desk basically felt like you are sitting on wood slats. Also typically when you get a sweet there is some room separation. The suites at this hotel however do not have that type of separation they have a dividing wall but the wall only extends up about 4 feet above the ground level thus not providing any real separation. The reason for this being the problem is because the fact that I usually go to bed earlier and get up earlier than my wife and the separation allows me to work on the computer or do whatever without disturbing the person who is sleeping. That was kind of the point of gettingthe suite. I feel that the bathroom was adequate however the colors are a little bit older and some of the furnishings are little bit older however as I understand it's the room rates are very reasonable. Unfortunately with the package that we got, one night in the hotel and dinner in the restaurant was approximately $660. We did have a great time at dinner however I don't know if this really feels like a substantial discount. I think that if you are staying in the downtown area and you get a good deal on this hotel that it is acceptable. There is a great lobby there is a great area to sit around if some of your friends join you. However the rooms are somewhat disappointing.

Upon check-in, the front desk clerk asked if we would like to upgrade our $199 deluxe room to a junior suite for an additional $34.50, so we did. For $234, we thought our Junior Suite accommodations offered great price-value (see my pics). The hotel is beautiful with its dark wood paneling, antique furniture and accents.

At first, I was leery of the hotel based on the reviews posted here. However, after four days of constant meetings, I was pleasantly surprised by the level of service and the overall feel of the hotel. First, this is not a brand-new hotel. There will be some quirks to it, which perhaps is some of its charm. Check-in was pleasant, although I was surprised that no one offered to help me with my baggage until after I had trekked up the short escalator to get the elevators for my room. I stayed on the 8th floor and was a bit confused trying to find my room. The halls are winding and, if you look at the evacuation plans posted near the elevator, it seems as if each room on the floor has it's own shape/size. I stayed in a double room, which was a nice size for a downtown hotel. What made it special was the walk-in closet. Since we had to share rooms with our co-workers, an extra changing area/storage space was most welcome. Sure, the carpeting was a bit run down, but the rest of the furniture was okay and spread out enough so it didn't feel entirely crowded. The bathroom was a decent size with plenty of towels. The counter was big enough for us to share with all our toiletries. Housekeeping did a nice job of keeping our room clean. Since I was on business, the internet was vital and it was nice to (finally) have wireless that didn't cost $$ per day to access. Our meeting rooms were in the grand ballroom as well as the mezzanine levels. Again, it is tricky to navigate the floors and the elevators, especially if you are lugging equipment (or even your laptop roller case) from session to session. If you are planning a meeting here, be sure to bring plenty of signs to direct your attendees to the right rooms. Again, navigation can get a bit tricky to the meeting rooms. The banquet staff was outstanding as was the food. For our three day meeting, it was the best hotel buffets (breakfast, lunch and dinner) that I have ever had! Everything tasted fresh and full of flavor, and the staff was very attentive in clearing dishes and keeping coffee cups filled. Except for the first day, when we had a half-morning general session and we kept running out of coffee in the meeting room, the service was on point. The business center was decently equipped and, thankfully, had an attendent. Everything was automated through a touch-screen terminal. You have to swipe your credit card and then select what you want to use (fax, copier, computer). You were charged by the minute instead of say, per page, which in some ways is better than being charged per page for a fax (I once spent $50 on an outgoing 50-page fax because it HAD to go). Incoming faxes, however, were sent to the bellstand instead of the front desk, and I had to wait several minutes until someone showed up and I could get my faxes. After that, they began delivering them right to my room. Since we were there during the NFL playoffs, we crowded into the hotel bar to watch the last few minutes of the football game. One bartender was super-friendly and helpful; the other bartender was obviously in a bad mood, since she ignored several of us until she was ready. Also, when I ordered a round of drinks, she informed me somewhat nastily that what I was ordering was very expensive. While on one level, I appreciated the alert that the drinks were expensive, but her angry attitude was completely off-putting. Our awards dinner was held in the French Room, which was rated as the #1 hotel restaurant in the US by Zagat. It was an incredible experience and the food and service were absolutely outstanding. Finally, check out was easy and the staff eager to help me with my bags (unlike when I checked in).

The hotel is located in the middle of Dallas & approximately a 10-15 minute walk from the West End (tourist area).

Trail riding at the Beaumont Ranch was great, beautiful scenery and about \u00c2\u00a340 for 2 people for an hour of riding. I would also recommend visiting the Dallas Aquarium and the Sixth Floor Museum (old Texas Book Depository building). The Reunion Tower (Hyatt Regency Hotel) is also a must.

So that awful night that I got in after 11 p.m., after hours of flight delays, having eaten nothing (thank you airlines, for that!), I was able to order a sandwich from room service. This last trip I ordered the cilantro roasted chicken from room service for dinner and it was SO GOOD! The beds are very comfortable, and my room was charmingly different in that old hotel kind of way. One caveat about this very old hotel, though. There is no way of saying this without sounding crazy, so I will just say it: I am pretty sure it is haunted. I will leave it at that, and say that even so, the service is so great I think I will always try to stay there while in Dallas.", "Date": "April 13, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Service": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Lancaster, SC", "Title": "\u201cgood choice in Dallas\u201d", "Author": "MBNick", "ReviewID": "UR4601672", "Content": "Located right in downtown it is a very attractive hotel. There are 3 restaurants, one a rodeo bar on the lower level, the Bistro on the main level and the top rated French room. There is an afternoon tea that you need to register for. Drinks are served in the classy upper lobby by the piano, with jackets needed after 6 pm. The rooms are very spacious, clean, and very nicely furnished. Beds and linens are above average. Only downsides in the room are 1 sink in the bathroom, and a small TV due to the furnishings. Rodeo bar good place for a beer and throwing peanut shells on the floor. The Bistro is nicely done, food is nothing special, wine by the glass ran $12-13. Servers and service are good. French Room gets rave reviews from many and while it is definitely upscale you probably won't leave feeling like you got what you paid for ($72.pp and up) Hotel staff is excellent and really focused on customer service. Only met one bellhop (Brook?)who was not up to snuff. Guess he felt $1.25 per bag was not enough. Over-all would certainly stay there again and would recommend.", "Date": "March 12, 2006"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Adolphus Hotel", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g55711-d114942-Reviews-Adolphus_Hotel-Dallas_Texas.html", "Price": "$111 - $314*", "Address": "<address class=\"addressReset\"><span rel=\"v:address\"><span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">1321 Commerce St.</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:locality\">Dallas</span>, <span property=\"v:region\">TX</span> <span property=\"v:postal-code\">75202</span></span> </span></span></address>", "HotelID": "114942", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/01/de/4e/54/the-adolphus-beer-baron.jpg"}}
