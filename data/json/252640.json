{"Reviews": [{"Content": "The best Bang for your Buck 30 minutes from Mexico City's International airport. Easily a 4 star bedroom. Clean sheets, towels, baths, jacuzzi, cable tv, room service, parking lot, bellboy, restaurant, everything. The manager Mr. Lino Aldir excellence in customer service needs to be mentioned. The only down side is the neighborhood, which happens to be a rather dangerous one. I rented a car and always drove in and out, also requested a safe taxi, didn't have a problem at all. All these for 45 USD daily, which, to us, makes it unbeatable. We stayed for a week.", "Date": "Dec 11, 2002", "ReviewID": "UR355773089", "Ratings": {"Service": "-1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "-1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "5", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "-1", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member"}], "HotelInfo": {"HotelURL": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g150800-d252640-r822489-Hotel_Oslo-Mexico_City_Central_Mexico_and_Gulf_Coast.html", "HotelID": "252640", "Price": "Unkonwn"}}
