For several weeks prior to our visit I had followed the reviews here on TA and due to the glowing reviews perhaps my expectations were a bit unrealistic. First of all the place isn't at all impressive from outside looking more like a parking garage than a hotel. But in all fairness most reviews noted this but what wasn't noted was the unimpressive decor on the inside. The concrete balconies surrounding the inner courtyard are plain and cold...it reminded me of an Alcatraz cell block. The room itself is indeed spacious but it feels \"sterile\". The carpets are a very strange pattern of dark \"dashes\" which, to us, wasn't easy on the eyes. I had requested a room with a view, but when I opened the blinds I was shocked to find myself staring at a bare wall only a few feet away. There is somewhat of a veiw from the rooftop, but again the furnishings there are cold and uninviting. Perhaps a family with children might appreciate the kitchen rendering the ability to prepare meals in-house, but don't book this hotel expecting any charm or elegance.

Some will say that the hotel is dated and lacks ammenities found in mega hotel chains. But, these things only add to the beauty of this place. The hotel seems as if it is a converted apartment/condo space. All of the rooms are at least a one bedroom suite. However, the place feels more like an apartment or home rather than a sterile hotel room. It was clean and inviting with no troubles. There is no pool, but the advantage to that is there are less children in the hotel. In fact, I only saw 2 during our stay. That is a plus for couples and adults that want to get away. Instead of a pool, this hotel has a rooftop lounge area with an unobstructed view to Alcatrez and Ghiardelli Square. You can also see both the Golden Gate Bridge and the Bay Bridge from there. The rooftop is worth the price of admission. Now let's discuss the location. There isn't a more perfect location. The hotel is 2 blocks from the Wharf, one block from Ghiardelli Square, and two trolley car stops from Lombard Street. It is situated on a corner that has a trolley stop and many bus routes. We used the buses and trolley to tour the entire city. The location cannot be beat! It was away from most tourists to be peaceful, yet close enough to feel safe walking around the hotel. There are plenty of restaurants and shopping nearby, as well as grocery stores to stock up the kitchen. The fully functional kitchen was perfect for a week long stay. The service at this hotel was top notch. The front desk staff provided excellent recommendations and knew how to navigate the city efficiently.

The room was very clean and nicely decorated, the kitchen was stocked with brand new utensils and cookware and we had a balcony with a peek a boo view of Alcatraz. We found this location to be perfect for all the sightseeing we did in our two days. Friends of mine had suggested that maybe Union Square was where we should stay, but we loved this location and only went up to Union Square to do some shopping once. While we were in San Fran the weather was pretty cool and windy, so unfortunately we didn't get to sit up on the rooftop deck and enjoy the view. We barely got to use our own balcony, but it was sure nice to be able to step up and feel the temperature to decide on what to wear before venturing out for the day. The hotel is only a few blocks walk to Lombard (the crookedest street) and one block to Ghiradelli Square's delicious chocolate shop and a couple blocks to fun Fisherman's Wharf.

After reading miamotos review before going I was worried., but once we arrived I was scratching my head trying to figure out what he was talking about. First of all this is not really a hotel. It is mainly timeshare units and there are some permanent residents. We stayed in suite 106, it was obviously remodeled in the recent history. It was very modern with granite tops and new wallpaper. Many of these are privately owned and time shared or vacation rentals, but the 2 that we saw inside we very fresh and modern looking. This place sits on the corner of Hyde street, you could not ask for a better location. It is literally one block from the cable car turnaround station and the historic cable cars run right in front of the building. I am not sure how anyone could complain about having to walk out your front door and catch a cable car, but I guess some people like to complain. The noise was minimal and to me was part of the charm of being in San Francisco. If you don't like the sound of cable cars, then you should not be in San Francisco because that is what you will hear all day long throughout the wharf and Pier 39 area. I could just faintly hear them in the morning, but it was not bothersome to us at all. We loved it. The elevator is small, but there were 2 of us with 2 large suitcases, a medium travel bag, a large camera bag, 2 laptop cases and my gf's large purse and we had plenty of room. The staff was awesome, the rooms were kept immaculate. The staff went out of their way to help. Anytime I asked about anything they pulled out lists pertaining to my question (for example close restaurants). As far as no food in house, there is a fridge, microwave and stove. There are grocery stores withing a few blocks. Also you are literally one block from a mile long stretch of over 100 restaurants! There is every kind of food you could want within a few blocks.

Parking - Horrible - there is no valet parking available. Must park in a very small parking lot with no space.

If you're looking for a new modern luxury resort, this is not the place for you. The style is what you would expect considering its vintage, the bathroom and kitchen are small but functional and the railings on the balconies are slightly rusty metal. Also it is on a major bus route and beside the trolley tracks so there is lots of street noise. For this part of our trip, it was the perfect hotel for us (two adults and a teenager). We had stayed overnight at the airport and arrived at the hotel at 10 am, they provided us with secure luggage storage so we could enjoy our day. When we checked in that afternoon we found our room to be very roomy and very clean and the staff friendly. We stayed in room 301, a one bedroom suite for four nights. The elevator was interesting but slow so I wouldn't recommend the third floor unless you are fit enough to use the stairs, which we did. There was an in-room safe plenty large enough for the laptop and other stuff. The kitchen and bathroom were dated but clean. The bed was comfortable and the sofa bed was very good with a real mattress and good canvas support. The balcony was functional and the roof top deck was great, we even ate our supper there one night (very good vietmamese take out from Grandeho's Kamekyo less than 1/2 block away). The do allow smoking on the roof top deck which we didn't like. We didn't have a car for this portion of our trip but we did buy a multiday transit pass which worked out great. There is a lot to see and do within walking distance, we used the transit system to go to the Academny of Science which was amazing, the cable car museum which was great also and to Little Italy for an amazing authentic Italian lunch at the Original US Cafe. We took the Mr Toad 90 minute \"Hop around the City tour\" on our first full day which gave us great information about the city and the recommendation for the Original US Cafe. Michaelis Food Store just a block west, had a great selection of wine and beer. Lori's Diner in Garadelli Square makes great milkshakes and homemade apple pie. The Pier Market had very good Red Curry and Coconut Mussels and Scoma's makes really good clam chowder. We had Vietnamese from Grandeho's Kamekyo twice because it was so good. For us this was the perfect hotel for this location, clean, comfortable and with room to for the teenager to have some private time.

San Francisco was our last stop on the way up the coast from Orange County prior to heading back to Indianapolis. At the last minute we decided to come into San Francisco a day early. Unfortunately this place didn't have any rooms available and we ended up paying way too much at another hotel just one block down the road. Luckily this place had rooms open for our last two nights. The outside of the hotel looked a little dingy, but the inside was amazing. It was the best place that we stayed during the entire week and a half visit to California. I'm only sorry to say that we didn't find any other places like this. The room was very spacious. It wasn't like the other places that you walked in and it was just a room and bathroom, this place had a full living/dining room with foldout couch, a kitchen with a convection microwave, dishes and full sized refridgerator, and a seperate bedroom. Everything in the room was very modern and didn't look outdated at all. It was the only hotel that we stayed in with flat screen tv's. We were able to request a balcony room so that we could sit out and watch all the hussle and bussle. Not only did we have a balcony, the roof was also open to guests, and the view was stunning. For all the smokers out there, San Francisco is very smoke free. You are not able to smoke on the balcony here, but we were allowed to smoke on the roof as long as we didn't offend any other guests. Most of the other hotels wouldn't even allow you to smoke anywhere on the property. We were only a very short 3 block walk to the main strip of the wharf, and very close to Ghiradelli Square. We have 3 boys, and have already decided that when we come back we are going to make sure that we book this place well in advance, as the kitchen area will help keep the food & drink costs down. There is a very elegant chef owned restaurant across the street (SW corner of Hyde and Bay), so if you enjoy fine dining be sure to bring nice attire to wear. The parking is very affordable compared to other places in the area (1/2 the cost). The hotel attendants were wonderful, even called to let us know that they were there to help if we needed help with anything in the area. There are so many wonderful things I could say about this place.

Lombard St (Crooked St) is a short distance from the hotel up a very steep hill - I took it upon myself to walk up there, and it only took about 10 mins each way at an easy pace. On the walk back from Pier 39, we pass the stores at Fishermans Wharf that sell the freshly cooked crabs and had them \"to go\" to enjoy back at the hotel a couple of times - they were delicious (and I normally don't even like crabs)! There was free wifi in our suite, and there's a complimentary business center (i.e. computer with a printer) near reception for guests' use - very handy for printing out our tour vouchers for the next day, etc. Room service was every couple of days, but they did come and collect the rubbish daily (i.e. they got the crab shells out of our suite before too long!). The hotel does not have a lot of suites, and we found that it booked out early, so if you're interested, get onto it sooner rather than later!", "Date": "February 23, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "1.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Salzburg, Austria", "Title": "\u201cCheck your reservation: they booked me into wrong hotel\u201d", "Author": "Leopoldskron", "ReviewID": "UR96278099", "Content": "From the reviews this looked like a great place so I picked up the phone to make a reservation.

So I called to cancel (of course) and then got the runaround about whether they had space available. I called central reservations and was told there was space available, but only for a minimum 2-day stay (I only wanted one night), but only the front desk could override. Front desk said they couldn't override... and that their schedule showed no space. Meanwhile I was looking at their own website's schedule which DID show space available. Front desk said he didn't know why the website said there was space. So bottom line: with a big outfit like this, that has multiple properties around the country, make sure you confirm where you are booked. Front desk's best guess of what happened to me? \"Perhaps he or she in central reservations hit the wrong button and pulled up Anaheim instead of San Francisco.\"", "Date": "February 11, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cExceeded expectations\u201d", "Author": "Seriously1971", "ReviewID": "UR96049223", "Content": "Went for a girls weekend.

On our second morning, however, though we had not used the kitchen at all, the sink was suddenly filled with soapy water. We reported the problem to the desk clerk on our way out for the day, and she said she would send maintenance up to fix it. The next morning, quite awhile after my husband had showered, I heard a gurgling noise from the tub and entered the bathroom to see the tub filled with a black substance looking like sewage. We were checking out so thought we'd report the problem to the front desk, but when we went down, the whole front desk area was covered with buckets, lights out, and the front desk clerk distressfully apologized.

If you get a car, there's a parking in the hotel but I must admit it is quite expensive. There is no restaurant but we're talking about suites here and you have a full kitchen in the room. But anyway, the staff is so great that they'll just explain you where everything is located and what you can do. It is probably one of the best services I've seen in a hotel !

When I complained that a man who'd come later had just been given a room, the staff member explained that room allocations are done in the morning and can't be changed during the day. And when I walked on the carpet, it was still very damp - even 4pm was not late enough - and the room smelled musty the next day. I fail to see why a hotel with sufficient staff needs to allow 6 full hours for Housekeeping to clean vacated rooms. I can't understand why Housekeeping would decide to shampoo the carpet of an apartment allocated to a guest who has indicated that he or she would arrive at noon. I would much rather have had a slightly dirty but dry carpet than a clean, damp one after a long delay. I also can't understand why room allocation cannot be made more flexible, so rooms can be allocated as guests arrive.

As soon as we walked into the lobby, instead of asking, he told my guest and I that he needed to talk to us in such a tone that we thought was rude and demanding, hhhmmm...no, rather it's if I want to talk to u or need ur services I will, but to tell me u need to talk to me, especially if ur suppose to be a conciere and we hadn't even checked in yet.......well no. Fortunately, I saw it this morning while getting ready to leave the hotel, but under the coffee table there were cut toe nail trimmings from someone who had stayed there. It tells me that the cleaning lady was lazy and didn't vaccum under the coffee table, which is unacceptable. Makes one wonder what else wasn't clean, hhmmm? Also, while using the hair dryer the fuse blew so it shut the power off to the entire unit except the refrigerator. I had to test the GFI and fuse box to finally trigger the power back on. There's a reasonable expectation that someone will use the hair dryer so why not upgrade the fusebox to accomodate the power surge?! In todays times, this should not be happening. As for the room itself, I realze they're old and for the most part the room was fine. I do like the idea of having a kitchen and separate bedroom/living room so if someone wants to nap or sleep they can without it bothering anyone. U don't find these types of places much. The roof top wharf view is nice and it's close to areas of interest that walking to and from makes it easy instead of driving everywhere. Value wise, it's very affordable for what ur getting, which is why I gave it a 5 star. As far as recommending it, well, not so sure. Perhaps if ur doing a quick overnighter and don't care about quality, service,etc...but if I'd recommend it to my parents for them to stay, no I wouldn't because of the items mentioned.
