{"Reviews": [{"Content": "Good location and price This hotel was easy to find and convenient to subway stations, Senso-ji and Ueno. We booked the deluxe double which was a relatively big room and bathroom, for only a few extra dollars. We were excited by the bath which had spa jets when we saw it, but there is a sign that we weren't allowed to use it because of the noise. Like all the hotels we stayed at in Japan it was clean.This appears to be great value for Tokyo. We looked at much more expensive accommodation on the various websites so we were very happy with the price of this one, for what we got. As a couple, we managed very well with the slightly bigger room.Komagata Dozeu restaurant just to the north is well worth a visit.", "Date": "Apr 27, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR631062467", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "Rexgoes"}, {"Content": "Very good location, small (but clean) rooms Just stayed at the Komagata Asakusa a few days ago and found the location to be excellent - right around the corner from the subway lines and an easy walk to Sensoji Temple. Room was clean. Refrigerator, AC, color TV with 2 free movie channels, coin laundry and free internet (2 computers in lobby and I think free WiFi in rooms - don't have a laptop so don't know for sure). Faces the street so a little noise from the outside, but just simple traffic noises -- nothing too disruptive. I slept easily through it. You pay for your entire stay at check-in which was fine, but I had to ask for a receipt for the cash I had just given them. Their policy is to give you a receipt at check-out, but I don't like to hand over cash without getting a receipt. I asked for one and the front desk clerk wrote one for me - I think they're used to foreigners asking for this. The shower ceiling is VERY low... I'm under 5'5 so was not a problem, but anyone over 5'8 will have to duck their head a bit. Free b'fast is just miso soup and onigini (rice balls). I passed every morning as there are so many great coffee shops and bakeries to go to. I had originally booked the Toyoko Inn at Kabuki-cho, but my friends in Japan thought the location was a terrible idea and convinced me to stay in Asakusa instead. Would recommend for a single or a couple who can stand tight quarters. Great rates for a great location.", "Date": "Oct 16, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR334666713", "Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Business service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "2", "Overall": "3", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "ChgoGal11225"}, {"Content": "Ideal for short break in Tokyo Very well located hotel, comfortable and friendly.

Great if you want to visit the early morning fish market. Breakfast included of miso and onigiri rice balls though we skipped on this. There are lots of small places to eat on the way up to the temple, though it wasn't a particularly buzzing scene at night and we opted for Ometesando area (Fujimamas is a great first and last night option).
