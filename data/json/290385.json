Le Walt is situated just next to Ecole Militaire metro station (line 8) and also almost on the edge of Parc Du Champ De Mars which means that the Eiffel Tower is just minutes away. There are restaurants around and even a convenience store on the oposite site of the street. Our room (we requested one on the top floor) was tiny but very cosy and we had amazing views as the windows were facing the Eiffel Tower! We could also spot Sacre Coeur after leaning out of the window. Both room and the bathroom were clean and very nicely decorated. The room was equipped not only with TV but also a DVD player. There is also a free WiFi connection available. And last but not least - the staff. They were all so kind and welcoming which is not so common nowadays! It was a pleasure to stay at Le Walt, highly recommended!", "Date": "March 12, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Warsaw, Poland", "Title": "\u201cGREAT location, nice hotel for a short stay\u201d", "Author": "KA_and_MA", "ReviewID": "UR125950479", "Content": "Le Walt is a nice boutique hotel with a GREAT location, HOWEVER it\u2019s good to be aware of a few facts, not to be disappointed about the choice: 1. This is NOT a design hotel which you count on taking a look at the pictures. I was a bit expecting, the classical paintings will be mixed with a modern, design furniture, bathroom etc, but it\u2019s definitely not. All the furniture, lamps, bathroom are simple and rather basic, however the room as a whole, although really tiny- makes quite a nice impression 2. I\u2019m not sure it makes sense to pay extra for an executive room- I can\u2019t imagine superior could be any smaller\u2026 I saw the difference on the web site \u2013 a small sitting area on top of superior room, but there was nothing like this in reality in the room we got. It was a room no. 402- I even had a doubt we got a right room, but receptionist confirmed it\u2019s the executive one. As for the size of a room, the bathroom is quite spacious. 3. The rooms which have an Eiffel view are quite noisy as facing quite a busy street. Personally I enjoyed it, but if you want some quiet and a night with an open window- rather ask for a courtyard side. 4. This is a perfect hotel if you\u2019re coming for the weekend, want to see a lot and enjoy the city. The rooms are too tiny for a longer stay in my personal opinion BESIDES Hotel staff is nice and friendly Wifi works well and it\u2019s free Hotel is right next to Ecole Militiare Metro, so you got an easy access whenever you need It\u2019s a walking distance to Eiffel tower and Invalides, lots of bars and restaurants around, also a small Carrefour and eco shop just a few steps away A few tips that could be helpful: \u2022 Do not order a breakfast when booking a room- you can always buy it, BUT there are so many places just a few steps away to enjoy (example: Le Terrasse just a few steps away on the corner, serves breakfasts from 7:30- 11:30) \u2022 Check the rates on hotel\u2019s own web site. It was more attractive then booking.com when I was making my reservation as I was able to order a \u201clast minute offer\u201d. Also- if you just had a birthday, they have something special for you \uf04a \u2022 If you like to enjoy a piece of \u201clocal life\u201d go to the Rue Cler (turn right when getting out from the hotel, cross the street and turn first left)- you can see street sellers of fruits, flowers, meet, fish and have a breakfast or just a coffee there. \u2022 7 le Vin 68 avenue Bosquet it\u2019s a nice, small restaurant nearby with a great friendly, English speaking stuff and delicious food. It\u2019s better to make a reservation as the place is quite busy.", "Date": "March 11, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Munich, Germany", "Title": "\u201cFantastic Experience!\u201d", "Author": "SeeingTheWorldNow_11", "ReviewID": "UR125434997", "Content": "I spent 4 nights at Hotel Le Walt and had a wonderful stay.

The 7th is basically a high end residential arrondisement but this particular corner of the 7th. combines a residential feel--grocery stores, wine shops, patisseries (one of which is the fabled Le Notre)--with a lively cafe scene, proximity to major attractions and, very nearby, the food lovers' Rue Cler. Add to this the beautiful trees and buildings of Avenue de la Motte Picquet and adjacent boulevards, the parks of the Champ de Mars (Eiffel Tower) and Invalides short blocks away, the shopping on La Tour Marburg, the short walk to Rodin Museum and Musee D'Orsay, an abundance of great bistros nearby and a Metro stop at your doorstep and you know that there is no better place to stay. The Le Walt itself is stylish with exceedingly accommodating and helpful staff, a charming and inviting patio and free internet in the lobby. It is a very small hotel--22 rooms. The rooms themselves are small but not tiny. Storage is barely adequate; bathrooms nice and with all amenities--ours was very attractive and had w.c. in separate room. Anything needed was produced with alacrity but several quickly responded to calls failed to result in our air conditioning being more than minimally adequate (though our friends did not have a similar problem). Bed was exceptionally comfortable and as our room faced courtyard it was quiet. My major complaint was that the lighting in the room is far less than adequate--reading was really only possible in the bathroom. The hotel is, again, stylish and charming with an extremely accommodating, pleasant and helpful staff. It has its drawbacks but the fantastic location overrides all. Unless someone builds a better hotel on the same block the Le Walt will be our Paris headquarters when we return.

The hotel is slap bang outside Ecole Militaire Metro station (exit Duquesne) and is within walking distance of the Eiffel Tower, the Louvre, the Seine, etc so is very well located. There is a caf\u00e9/bar next door, a Carrefour mini supermarket opposite, and Rue Cler a couple of minutes walk away (with lots of cafes and market stalls), so food and drink is easy to find (you don\u2019t want to spend it in the hotel on food and drink as you will get ripped off!). The hotel is a boutique hotel so is a bit on the small side, but is tasteful and decorated with class. Although not sure about the massive painting hanging above the bed (mine had one with a lady showing her boob) but could have been worse. The room was modern and clean, and was equipped with a flat screen TV and DVD player (which is good, as there are very limited English language channels). The bed is big and comfortable, and you have a little desk and lamps for adequate illumination. We had a superior room as we felt a standard room would be too small, and I'd say we were right as the room was spacious enough for us to be comfortable. I think a smaller room would have been okay for a couple of days, but we're glad we took a larger room. The shower is above the bath instead of separated which is fine as they're obviously short on space as its a small hotel. You are provided with nice L\u2019Occitane toiletry products (shampoo, shower gel, body lotion, soap, shower cap, manicure kit, earbuds, cotton pads), hairdryer and pretty good quality towels. We weren\u2019t given any slippers or bathrobes, which was surprising for a 4 star hotel. There is a minibar, which isn\u2019t security chipped, so you can at least use it to put a few of your own items in if you so wish (I never take any items from minibars in hotels, unless I am really desperate!). We had an okay sleep, it is a little noisy on the main road in the weekday morning (Friday morning) but Saturday morning was a lot quieter. We had 2 main gripes from this trip\u2026the first room we were put in, the air conditioning wasn\u2019t working, it kept getting hotter instead of colder! This was even after we had been shown how to use it. Anyway, we requested another room instead, although we were asked if we would be okay with opening the windows instead (of course we weren\u2019t okay with it, we\u2019d paid for an air conditioned room and not to mention noise and pollution!!). We declined of course, and they put us in another room pretty much straightaway, which I was pleased about. The next room\u2019s air conditioning was working, but still wouldn\u2019t go as cold as we wanted, but it was much more bearable than the other room. Gripe resolved. Second gripe is that upon checking out, we were told we had taken breakfast in the hotel one morning. We were very surprised to hear this, as we had on both mornings gone out to have breakfast at somewhere more reasonably priced (hotel breakfast is a rip off!). The lady at the front desk showed us a breakfast slip saying that two people from our room number had breakfast, and that it was proof of us having breakfast so we\u2019d have to pay. We weren\u2019t having any of that, so we protested, and eventually, she went to ask the breakfast waitress whether she recognised our faces for having breakfast on the said morning. Luckily for us, she had not seen us (we\u2019re probably the only Indian faces in the place, so easily recognisable), so we were finally off the hook. We think someone must have either given our room number by accident, or even on purpose. I think this hotel needs to ensure they ask people\u2019s name with their room number or some other suitable method for checking breakfast entries, as their system obviously doesn\u2019t work. Gripe resolved, but still a bit annoyed by it. All in all I would still recommend Le Walt as the price, location and comfort level is pretty good considering other places in Paris, but I don\u2019t know if I would personally go there again, purely because of the two gripes listed above. Couple of tips for Paris (which you\u2019ll have read in other TripAdvisor reviews no doubt!): - Best ice cream, Berthillon on Ile Saint Louis - Best hot chocolate (and pastries) at Angelina on Rue Rivoli (between Place de Concorde and Le Louvre). - Best falafel (and quick service) at L\u2019As Du Fallafel (Rue des Roisiers near Saint Paul station) - Eiffel Tower at night has special sparkles for the first 5 minutes of every hour - Le Louvre museum free on 1st Sunday of the month, otherwise at reduced rate of 6 euros on Friday evening (6pm onwards) \u2013 otherwise normal entry is 9 euros 50 cents. - Watch out for scary men selling stuff near the Sacre Coeur, and be strong to say no and walk off!!", "Date": "March 22, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Oxford", "Title": "\u201cA real find in Paris!\u201d", "Author": "SFWOxford", "ReviewID": "UR58813630", "Content": "Having lived in Paris a few years ago whilst working for a travel company I know that hotels in Paris can be a bit hit and miss!

The room was comfortable if a little compact. We'd mentioned an anniversary on booking with eurostar and found that we'd been upgraded to a superking bedroom (handy as we're both tall!). There was only one bathrobe, which wasn't rectified when mentioned at the reception, but not really a problem, so we didn't pursue it. The room was clean and the bathroom stocked with L'Occitane toiletries, hairdryer,etc. There was free internet station in the lobby, although I didn't get chance to use it. Location was great. It was about half a mile from the Eiffel Tower, which we reached at 9.30am and even then there was a queue to go up. The reception advised on a little street full of restaurants to visit in the evening, with reasonably priced food. The metro system was so efficient and cheap (go as far as you like for 1.6 euros) that it didn't matter that we weren't in the centre of Paris. Liked best: location and it was very quiet at night.

They were so kind and helpful and their English made up for our lack of speaking French. Housekeeping did a great job every day. We were in room 102. It had 2 twin beds but they could be moved together. Its on the front side of the hotel, it can be a little loud, but my husband likes to have a little white noise while he sleeps. Plus walking and being on the go all day made us so tired, that eventhough we noticed the street noise, we slept really well.One afternoon there was a loud demonstration that marched by, but that only happened once and it was only for a few minutes in the afternoon. Really no big deal. The shower was fine,and had great water pressure with an adjustable shower head that actually was high enough for my 6' 4\" husband. The partial glass shower door is common in Paris. Just put an extra towel beside the bath mat to catch tthe droplets and spray that get by the glass. Having a \"nicer\" metro stop just up the street and shops close by was really convenient. After going to the bustling, somewhat seedy Right Bank area for sightseeing, we were very glad to stay in this charming Left Bank area. We stayed 8 nights and enjoyed every minute! If you can stay a week or more I definately recommend it, you will be glad you weren't so rushed. But no matter what you need even more than a week to see all of Paris. We loved staying near the Eiffel and Invalides, plus being in the Rue Cler district was so quaint. We loved to stroll the streets in the morning and evening. We ate breakfast at the Cafe Du Marche everyday and had dinner at Ulysses (twice), Cafe Du Marche (1), Sud 7 (1), La Terrace(1). We loved the Rue Cler merchants, the nicest shopkeeper at the newstand helped us find the best metro/street map. We almost felt like we were living in Paris for the week. For those who have heard that Parisians are rude: Our entire trip was filled with wonderful experiences and the nicest people. Just be polite, learn a few phrases before you go. Remember to enjoy and not always be in such a hurry. Don't feel desperate just because you are somewhere unfamiliar. Believe me my French is very basic and everyone, from the subway employees, to musuem employees, to waitstaff at restuarants, even police officers we encountered at landmarks were so kind and patient. Even security and customs at CDG airport. My husband was very impressed, he only knows a few phrases that I taught him and he was treated just as nice everywhere. I recommend the French Phrase Book by Rick Steves. His book on Paris is quite good, also. Study these books and you will feel much better a day or two into the trip.

The hotel definately very central without being right in the heart of the tourist places. Certainely the local bars and restaurants did not appear to be the tourist traps warned off. Some good restaurants near by as well as a supermarket over the way and a pattisiere a few doors down. We ate locally both nights and were very pleased. The restaurant directly next to the hotel (sorry name escapes me) served a great steak for 15Euro. We had a standard room overlooking the street. Yes it was a little noisy but it is a main road and the noise was not a problem for us. The bathroom was well appointed and the bed extremely comfortable. The room also had a flat screen TV and DVD player. Room very clean and comfortable. Hotel staff very friendly and polite and spoke good english. Check-in was not until 3pm but we arrived just after 1pm and shown straight to our room. Only negative comment would be was that the room was a little cold and took a good hour for the heating to get going though it was freezing outside. Also we really missed not having a hospitality tray. I don't know if this is the norm in Paris but a kettle and some tea/coffee would have been really appreciated and would be welcomed by other guests as well I'm sure.

I mean, one small soap for two people is a bit tight and even more so if it is not replaced with a new one after the first day. Same for shower gel. I mean it does not cost much, and i appreciate hotels trying to avoid customers just bagging them every day but you should expect one soap per person at this room price. That was the only downside and it would have been nice to have breakfast included at this room price too although it was clear before that it wasn't and that it is pretty standard to have a room without breakfast. However I stayed at other hotels that are much better in terms of price for money, but in other cities, Lisbon, Brussels etc. Paris seems a bit more expensive.

The hotel was a delight -- spotlessly clean, very comfortable bed, and a decent-sized room (for Paris). This was by far the best of four hotels I've visited in Paris, and would be my first choice for future visits. We were there on business (me) and vacation (my wife) and the hotel served very nicely for both purposes. Our room was very quiet and clean, with an armoire, comfortable bed, desk, small table, 2 chairs, and a bathroom with shower/bath combination. Because we were on the top floor, the ceiling was slanted near the wall, which cut a bit into headroom but provided nice dormer windows. Bathroom was very clean and functional, but the shower/bath was a little cramped and tended to splash water around (there was no shower curtain). As for room quiet, I'd note two things. First, the hotel is on a relatively busy street (Avenue de la Motte-Piquet) and rooms are on either the street side or back side facing a courtyard and the backs of apartments. Our room was on the back side, which we loved -- there was no traffic noise and it was very nice to feel \"at home\" by seeing people in the other apartments. On the street side, on the other hand, the higher-floor rooms would have views of the Eiffel Tower. So there's a tradeoff there. Second, because the hotel is over a Metro station, there was occasional rumbling from trains. Those did not bother us at all, but light sleepers on lower floors might notice them. The area was fantastically convenient, both for foot travelers (like us) and for those who prefer public transportation. For foot travelers, its location in the 7th puts it within 30 minutes of the Champs-Elysee, Louvre, Musee D'Orsay, Eiffel Tower, Invalides, and just a little longer to Latin Quarter and Notre Dame. For those who prefer less walking, there is a Metro stop literally 20 yards from the hotel, and you can get almost anywhere in the central part of Paris within 20 minutes. There is also a taxi stand around the corner. Nearby Rue Cler is a wonderful market area with many shops and restaurants. Wonderful, that is, if it were not somewhat overrun by tourists thanks to its being featured in a guide book. Still, it was very convenient for breakfast, wines, cheese, delightful restaurants, etc. I'd like to correct a couple of misperceptions that appeared in other reviews. First, the hotel does have internet access in the rooms. In fact, it is free access, through an ethernet port (requires a cable, available from the front desk). WiFi is only available in the lobby (for a fee). As long as you have an ethernet port, you will be OK. Second, the devices in the bathrooms are electric radiators, not towel warmers. Of course one can use them for towel warming, but that's not the primary purpose. The only thing that did not live up to expectations was laundry service. It was expensive (e.g., 9 euros to do a shirt), wasn't available on Sunday or Monday, and my pants came back with spots (which the hotel happily fixed, but took another day). I'd recommend to seek out another laundry service; there are several we saw nearby when walking around. Finally, the hotel had excellent service. Front desk and most other personnel were fluent in English. I especially appreciated the concierge service provided, which helped us make reservations at several restaurants (which is usually possible to do in English, but we were making them well in advance). All in all, the Le Walt was a great experience and we found it to be a good value -- expensive like everything in Paris, but well worth it.

The location is good, the Eiffel Tower is 10 minutes walk away and you can walk to all the main locations such as the Arc De Triomphe, Louvre and Notre Dame. The area is lively but residential which we liked. We had lunch one day and dinner another in a couple of the nearby Restuarants (one of which was the Auberge) which was really good and we felt we got a better deal than the poor quality of meals the Resturants that cater for tourists tend to produce. In terms of using the Metro, though right outside the Hotel we actually walked everywhere. The Hotel itself is small but quaint, modern and well decorated and the rooms though indeed small are large enough to do the job and were well appointed and clean, so we were very happy with what we had. We were on the 5th floor but did not have a few of the Eiffel Tower, not that we were particualrly bothered. On the negative, alchloic drinks in the hotel cost a fortune, a double Jack Daniels is 21 Euros!!! The first evening we had tickets for the Moulin Rouge, the show was fantastic though the food was abismal, but we wern't that suprised. Also our seats were right on the front row, so we were as good as on the Stage which concerned me, however they turned out fine in the end, though we'd have preffered to be at least half a dozen rows back. Other areas of interest, the Eiffel Tower is of course a must, if you've not been, queues were not too bad, probably took an hour to get in. We didn't realise you could go to the Top of the Arc De Triomphe so that was a pleasant surpise and gave great views of the City. We also went to the Louvre, which was excellant, though it's a little on the large side, they have 35,000 works and the place is so vast they all blend in to one and as for finding the exit, good luck! Tips: Watch the Taxi drivers, we got charged 45 Euros to get from the Gard Du Nord to the Hotel, on the return trip it was just 15 Euros. Also on going to the Moulin Rouge we were charged 20 Euros though the return journey was only 10. The only other real negative in Paris is that drinking out is very expensive, a beer can range from 5 Euros to 8 Euros for half a pint and shots around the same price, though generally wine is cheaper, more like 3.5 Euros a 25 CL glass.

So, if you travel lightly and look for elegant design and very simple comfort - go for Le Walt. otherwise, either spend more on finer hotel or look for other boutique hotels offering more than big pictures on the room wall.", "Date": "January 8, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "4", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Lowell, MA", "Title": "\u201cBest kept secret in Paris\u201d", "Author": "para911", "ReviewID": "UR6560951", "Content": "Ahhh Paris....

The hotel is in something of a cafe quarter, with plenty of options for eating and drinking, inside and out. At the Eiffel Tower, there is a Batobus stop, which will take you along the Seine to a number of the significant tourist spots. The hotel itself was sleek and clean, though our room was particularly small. We were put in a room at the back of the hotel, so did not benefit from a view of the tower, but perhaps had a bit less noise from the street outside. The back rooms are overlooked by a number of other buildings, so you'll need to keep the net curtains closed if you want privacy. In the room, there was a TV with numerous channels, including CNBC and BBC World, a DVD/CD player, a minibar/fridge and a safe. The minibar is big enough for you to put some of your own drinks/food in, and there's a supermarket across the road from the hotel. The bathroom was very modern, but had no shower curtain, resulting in a frequently wet floor. There were only four rooms on our floor (I think this is the case on all floors), so you don't get much noise from the corridor or the lift. The bar drinks were fairly expensive, but no worse than many bars in the area. Overall, Hotel le Walt was very well located, in what seemed to be a classy and pleasant area of the city. There were barriers surrounding holes in the pavement outside the hotel, but during our stay in mid-September, no work was being carried out. Whether or not the hotel is worth the rather high price, is a moot point. As it gives you easy access to the Metro system, Batobus and local eateries, while providing clean, comfortable sleeping accommodation, I'd say it's just about worth the money.

We were very pleasantly surprised. I'd mailed ahead and told them it was our honeymoon and that we wanted a room with a view of the tower. For some reason (even though I'd given our visa card number) they would only say they would do their best, they didn't guarantee us a tower view. We did actually get room 601 which has a really good view of the tower and was perfect for seeing the fireworks on the 14th! There are numerous places to eat in the area, there is a supermarket over the road so take your kettle so you can have coffee in your room. There is a Boulanger a few doors up if you decided to buy croissants, baguettes, eclairs etc and the metro is literally right outside. As the breakfast in the hotel was 13\u20ac a piece for just a continental style buffet breakfast, we thought we\u2019d head out and see if we could find somewhere cheaper. To be honest, you\u2019ll be hard pressed to find a cheaper breakfast unless you buy croissants yourself from the Boulanger or supermarket (which we did do) they are about 77cents each. We brought our own coffee, tea bags and a kettle and we got milk from the supermarket across the road from our hotel. We really did make a good choice of hotels, all the amenities right on the doorstep! We did eat breakfast in the hotel on the last day though for convenience and it was very good; fruit juice, coffee, cake, rolls, croissants, pain au chocolat, cereals, cold meats and cheeses (as much as you like, buffet style). That would fill you up til dinner time to be honest. So, again, you decide really. The room was beautifully decorated and immaculate with a big bath and a shower and clean towels every day. The staff are friendly and helpful. The room next door seemed to enjoy scraping their furniture across the floor (wooden floors) in the early hours, which was a bit annoying and we could even hear them walking around and lifting their loo seat so the soundproofing btwn rooms is not very good. The hotel is on a busy road so there is some traffic noise but that's the price you pay to be in a prime location I suppose. It's not too bad though. My only criticism would be that they didn't mention our honeymoon or congratulate us when we got there, a token gift or a card in the room would have made our stay a 10 out of 10. Just that little personal touch would have made such a difference. As it is, I'll give them a 9 out of 10 and would consider staying here again.

The room was tastefully adorned with modern furniture and a beautiful piece of art. Of course, it wasn't the standard american size room, but still was comfortable enough for the two of us.

The ground floor is very cute. There's the check-in desk, the bar, and the breakfast area. The bar isn't really a staffed bar, but whoever is working the front desk will be happy to grab you a glass of wine--at a decent price. 5.50 euros.

We did a ton of research on hotels in Paris before finally deciding on this one. From the moment you first walk into the boutique hotel, you know that you're in for a treat. The lobby is quaint and stylish, with a great aromatherapy-type scent. The rooms would best be described as \"modern-classic\". The color pallette and fixtures are very cutting edge, but they are offset by classic touches like a large painting for the headboard and hardwood (laminate) floors. The style was a perfect compromise, as I prefer modern and my wife prefers traditional. As for location, it's fairly close to everything, and just steps from a Metro stop. Our room had a view of the Eiffel Tower, although only some of the rooms offer this view. Even if you don't get a view it's still great. The young managers were extremely friendly and always eager to assist. Since it's a small property, you get a nice personal touch that you wouldn't receive at a larger hotel. There are tons of restaraunts right around the hotel, and the area is very safe. Only a few very minor drawbacks: 1. We had to request an iron and ironing board, as it's not in the room normally 2. No coffee maker in the room 3. Only a couple of restaurant menus for review at the front desk, would have preferred more selections of recommended locations. For the money, it's probably one of the better hotels in Paris.

The cons - the night staff pointed out to us that the hotel is understaffed, and uses temporary labor for almost everything. There was usually one person answering phones, handling guest concerns, tending bar, and serving breakfast. The breakfast also isn't worth the 13 Euros charged - better to walk up the street for a larger breakfast that's also cheaper.

All they ask for is your name, address, credit card number and a signature. I have stayed in hotels all over the world and I personally find this the norm. Anyway my wife and I found the hotel exceptionally clean and welcoming. The staff couldn't have been more friendly and polite. We stayed in room 402 which had a tremendous view of the (top third!) of the Eiffel Tower. With the room windows open there was a lot of noise from the street below but we knew this before we booked the hotel after reading reviews on this site. The noise is almost completely gone with the double glazed windows closed. (I had originally requested a room overlooking the (quiet) courtyard, but my wife and I were glad to have been given room 402 purely for the views outside of the tower and parisienne life going by). One thing you must try is the room service continental breakfast. For 12 Euros each (approx \u00a38) it is immense. We took the bread and pain chocolat out later in the day and lunched on it saving us from buying another lunch. As other earlier reviews state there is an abundance of restaurants and other eateries within a short walking distance but we found that by using some of the smaller ones down the side streets you will save money without compromising quality, this is true for both food and drink. On our last afternoon we had coffee in the hotels' courtyard and it is extremely quiet. (If you require a quiet room then make sure you ring the hotel and confirm you have been allocated one overlooking the courtyard. It REALLY is quiet) The metro Ecole Militaire is only 30 metres from the hotel and offers you a link to the whole of central Paris. We didn't really notice the underground noise from our room. On arrival you can purchase a 'Paris Visite' travel ticket from any station counter. These can be for 1,2,3, or 5 days and cover travel on Metro, bus, RER and coach. Make sure you buy the one covering the zones you want to use. E,g zones 1-3 cover central Paris whereas zones 1-8 will get you back to the CDG airport via RER. (See this link for more info) -------------------- The 'Paris Visite' ticket also has discount vouchers for a number of attractions. Another must for tourists are the river cruises. Bateaux Parisienne or Batobus can be taken from the base of the Eiffel Tower and for approx 10 Euros the trip will give you good views of a number of well known sights. When out and about on the Champs Elysees area watch out for the Japanese tourists who ask you to buy designer goods for them. They will give you hundreds of Euros and follow you to (Luis Vuitton for example) to buy special edition items. These items are usually sold as a maximum of one per customer. The designer outlets are on to this and, after questioning you about if you've been approached in the street by someome, will often refuse to sell you items unless you pay with your own credit card. It is very rare that I ever stay in the same hotel twice as I like to try different ones but if I did stay in the same area of Paris again I would use the Le Walt.", "Date": "September 22, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "3", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Chicago, IL", "Title": "\u201cMixed review of Le Walt - Mostly positive\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR3928279", "Content": "I have never left a review like this, but since I relied so much on them when planning our trip, I thought it was only fair to leave my own. I agree with many of the previous reviews regarding this hotel. The rooms are on the small side (think the width of a small queen bed plus a few feet), they are pretty clean but certainly not perfect, and are quite comfortable in terms of the bed and bathroom. If your goal is to have a big spacious room then this is not the place for you. The location is the big draw to this hotel in my opinion . . . being able to see the Eiffel Tower out your window and walk to it in 10 minutes is amazing. Plus having the Metro stop right outside your door is very convenient (we did not plan on using the Metro a lot, but it was so easy and cheap that we used it quite a bit). The street that it's on is moderately busy but not too busy in my opinion. It has everything that you could want right outside your door . . . many cafe options, a small grocery store for supplies across the street, and several nice shops right around the hotel. My mixed reviews concern the staff. They were extremely nice and friendly both in helping with the planning of our trip and during our time there. Almost all of the staff spoke perfect english, and were always available to answer questions. My biggest complaint would be that they didn't always seem to have the \"insider knowledge\" that you would hope to get when paying for a hotel in this range. Often times they relied on a Google search for our questions that I would think they would have more knowledge of. If you have a good handle on knowing what you want to do and are not looking for a lot of guidance from the hotel then I don't think this is an issue, but if you are looking for a good support system while in Paris I would be a little careful. Overall we had an amazing time in Paris, and I was quite pleased with the hotel.
