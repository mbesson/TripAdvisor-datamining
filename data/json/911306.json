Having read the reviews, we were somewhat cautious of making the booking but took our friends' advice and booked. Unfortunately, the reviews below really do reflect the reality of the hotel. To summarise: 1. Location - next to Louis Vitton and opposit Chanel but no shops to buy a bottle of water (even the restaurant that is part of the hotel would not sell a bottle of water to us as they had just turned the 'closed' sign). 2. Reception - there is now a room functioning as the reception area but it is next to the kitchen - I've never experienced such an over-powering smell of chip fat which also filled the corridors. However, we were grateful of being able to check-in at 10.30am rather than 3pm - not a sign of a busy hotel! 3. The room - a \"deluxe\" room booked - good attempt at modern style but in desperate need of refreshing. The black furniture was extremely dusty, the curtains were cardboard panels that have curled and were stained and the TV had clearly been cleaned very carelessly leaving large smears. Our wardrobe had electrics in the top corner which were extremely noisy. However, the bedding was very clean and smelled freshly washed. 4. Bathroom - very clean and smart. No complaints here. 5. Noise - although the hotel is on a quiet street in terms of night life, there appeared to be traffic all night long. Very noisy. Overall, I would not return.

A wonderfully designed (small but very efficient) boutique hotel located right at the hart of the best known fashionstreet of amsterdam and holland. When build probably looked great but bad materials, bad construction, bad cleaning and general lack of management really took it's toll. It does smell a little funny as mentioned earlier, there's cracks in almost every wall and there isn't a piece of wall unscarred by run-ins with luggage. The room looked great but the wooden floors throughout the hotel weren't picked to withstand intensive hotel use, they look dirty now. They're stained by years(?) of usage. The bathroom looked wonderfully designed with large sheets of white marble but the seams were brown / moldy. An uncovered air-vent was overgrown with mold and in plain sight. Also there was no hot water in the morning when we wanted to take a shower. The bed was clean and sheets were nice but the bed-lights didn't work (one was missing a bulb, the other didn't work). Checkout trouble: At checkout, there was no staff at the reception. After 5 minutes i went to the lunchroom downstairs of the hotel (same name also connected by internal stairs) to ask if i could check out. I was told i had to go to the reception in a -figure it out yourself- tone. When i responded i was there for 5 minutes without someone showing, the waitress responded she (the waitress) had just been upstairs and the reception was staffed. She repeated this several times in an very nasty tone of voice implying i was lying. She added 'i don't know how to do a checkout' hoping i would go away. After i got really angry, got told a had a big mouth, i went upstairs to leave the key and prepared to just leave ( they had my credit card details). Another waitress came in and very franticly made a phonecall to get the receptionist back. I got a quick apology and was asked for my credit card again (something wrong with their administration- really?). I told them i thought it would be a good idea to have some things repainted and fixed i was told they knew that should happen. A quick apology and a request for my signature for the payment please. I don't know what's going on here but this is a disgrace to the name of the street. Please restore the original idea, change the staff and as i'm not the first to complain here probably the management as well. A boutique hotel should be great at it's design.

The room was a mixture of modern design, with a cosy feel and the wood beams on the ceiling were really pleasant. On the negative side - the bathroom was in need of some minor repairs e.g. cracked tiles a smelly sink and a shower that was blasting hot!!! The lighting system was a bit too cleaver - in fact the lights could not actually switch off, they just went to a lighter shade!! This resulted in me wearing an eye mask as I was too tired to take it up with reception. We could not get a connection to the internet from our room which was frustrating, as that was a feature of the package which I was keen to utilize. When we checked out 2 of us got in the lift and the carriage dropped significantly I was so freaked out and spend the next two minutes panicking as to whether the lift would hold out!!! I had never been so glad to enter the reception. On the plus side the receptionist asked me if I was ok, and was savvy enough to offer to take our luggage down in the lift personally so we could use the stairs which I was really grateful for!

The entrance photograph on their website is of some other building, definitely not the shabby single door entrance existing. The small hallway about 10ft x 2ft had black filthy carpet that had not seen a hoover for months. Unsurprisingly there was no plug socket for a vacuum to function. Into a tiny lift that accommodates three at a squeeze, but two people plus weekend bag comfortably. Communal hallways scuffed, marked, unvacuumed and scruffy. Room on first impression were modern and tidy, if small. But it was all form over function. The shower in white/grey marble were extremely narrow and perilously slippery when wet measuring only 59cm across so if you are on the large side ( which I am not) you will have a real problem entering the shower. The glass doors to the bathroom area were heavy and you had to manouevre to the sink whilst squeezing through the door. Cleaning of the rooms did not happened over the three days we were there, Beds were made only. Breakfast food was left in the rooms all day and night and even after numerous requests they be cleared, we had to leave them in the hallway ourselves. Common areas had a few weeks of grey fluff/dust/dirt everywhere. On the second night we were pursued halfway up the Hooftstraat by the restaurant manger who was filling in for the hotel manager if we could let in the next guests( who happened to be our friends on a late flight as there were no staff to check them in at 10pm!) If that was, we hadn't anything planned - like dinner for instance! Ho hum. The location is fine if you want to be in Chanel all day, and close enough to the major museums etc, but not to hang around to let unwelcomed guests in especially as the hotel cafe/bar was closed all day and night Friday - so our friends had to come bags and all straight from the airport to the restaurant we were eating in some twenty minutes away. The alternative being to leave the restaurant to return to the hotel to let them in and return to dining later. Extraordinary to take bookings when you have NO staff to check in guests. First time I've ever seen that. The street is noisy every morning early though Sunday morning, unsurprisingly was quiet. A great weekend on the sightseeing front, but the hotel really left a blot on the experience. Horrid. Horrid. Horrid.

The hotel itself is really not a \"hotel\" -- there is no common space at all, no downstairs reception (you need a key to enter or be buzzed in, unfortunately the buzzer didn't work), the elevator only fits 2 people at one time, no room service, no internet, etc. And finally the service....I have never come across a more unpleasant assistant mgr! This woman told us off because after arriving early and jet lagged we asked if we could check in early. She lied about the availability of our room and only later let us in. Any time we asked for something - a towel (the maid took them away but didnt replace them), toilet paper - we would get blank looks and nothing. Everything was a chore! These people really shouldn't be running a hotel. The only positive and the reason I gave this hotel 2 stars is because the associated cafe is lovely and the waitstaff were fantastic, giving us helpful recommendations for the town. Those guys made our stay bearable. Beware -- I would AVOID this hotel with so many equally proced options on the canals.", "Date": "June 21, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "singapore", "Title": "\u201cA GREAT PLACE TO STAY\u201d", "Author": "jtmimii", "ReviewID": "UR27684032", "Content": "I must say the hotel is very charming and great to stay. good location and easy to around. the hotel stuff are very friendly and helpful with all the requests i asked. but i have to say that, the waiter (an asian guy) who work at the breakfast cafe is very arrogant and not friendly. he is simply a person that u dont wish to see first thing in the morning. he just spoiled your day. i really really think he should not be part of the hotel. he did not lift up to the hotel standard. please tell him to leave!", "Date": "April 9, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "England", "Title": "\u201cPerfect City Break Hotel\u201d", "Author": "RoseLou", "ReviewID": "UR27163093", "Content": "My boyfriend and I found the Hotel Patou to be perfect for a city break. Minutes from the museums and Vondelpark and within walking distance of the centre of Amsterdam, the hotel was located in a fashionable yet quiet area which was well serviced by local bars and restaurants . We stayed in Room 23 a stylish and comfortable double room with a small but chic bathroom. The layout of the hotel means that you can access your bedroom without passing the front desk giving a feeling of seculsion which was quite refreshing for us since we both travel for work and usually stay in large hotels. The only downsides were not major drawbacks for a short leisure break . Wardrobe space is very limited for two people for more than a couple of nights and the lighting whilst atmospheric, was not as flexible as it could have been. The Patou is a small and modern but not sterile boutique hotel on the doorstep of a lovely, relaxed and up market area. We got an excellent rate on the internet and it was a hotel that enhanced rather than detracted from our weekend break !", "Date": "March 31, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "2", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Brussels, Belgium", "Title": "\u201cGood hotel, dozy staff\u201d", "Author": "FreidaBrussels", "ReviewID": "UR18352311", "Content": "We stayed at the Patou hotel for a weekend in July. We were in a superiour room - which size-wise for Amsterdam wasn't bad (meaning it was about 3 times the size of the bed overall). The room had a modern/minimalist decor - but could have done with some re-painting as there were lots of bangs etc. When we arrived, we asked the guy at reception a few questions about the local area, how to get places etc - he was half asleep - couldn't answer any of them. Happily there was someone else at reception who answered for us. The next day at breakfast, same thing - the waiter had clearly had a very hard night - he managed to mix up all our order (which wasn't very complex), and then hung out in a corner avoiding our looks as we tried to get more coffee. That aside, the hotel is really nice, in a very good location, and for Amsterdam, is good value for money.
