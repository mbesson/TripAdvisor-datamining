We could only check in at 02:00 pm, while we had already arrived at Victoria Coach Station at 10:00 am after a very long and bumpy ride with a Terravision bus from London Stansted Airport. The young man at the reception told us we couldn't check in, yet. We could leave our luggage in the dining room already though. I didn't feel comfortable leaving my luggage in the dining room and decided to keep wearing my 9 kg backpack the rest of the morning through London. My friend who had a much heavier suitcase had no choice to trust these people. Finally we could check in at 02:00 pm. Both, my friend and I were surprised we were expected to pay for the room in advance. We got room 10 which is at the first floor. My friend could hardly enter the room with her suitcase, because the door is so narrow. I had to enter the room sideways myself (but I'm a big bloke). We stood directly in a 'hall' with at our left hand a small door to the toilet and at the right a shower base which was only separated from the 'hall' by a yellowish shower curtain. The door right in front of us lead to the actual bedroom. This door, with door-spring, was as small as the primary door to the 'room'. Our bedroom measured 2 x 4 metres. The beds were placed against the sides standing opposite from each other. Like the entire interior of the hotel, the room was painted in salmon pink and off-white. The paint job had been done quite poorly and made me think of an average student room. I can not confirm the accusations of mouldy and/or dirty rooms. The room got vacuumed every afternoon and the beds were made again, when we came back to our room, tired of walking all day long. The breakfast downstairs in the dining room, which seems to be a cellar to me. I assume the term 'continental breakfast' is chosen very consciously by the manager. It allows him to keep the breakfast very light and sober and therefore cheap. I was surprised to see that the cleaning lady was preparing the toast for the guests. It makes me think that the staff of the hotel is one family running the hotel. The staff was polite towards me and my friend, although they weren't very conversational. In my opinion it wouldn't be a bad idea if these people attend a course customer contact. It was nice that the reception was manned for 24 hours per day, though. Finally I have to make a remark about the so called walking distance. Of course it's great to have your hotel located near the stations in Victoria. But a walking distance of only 3 minutes is just not true! With a regular pass it will take you at least 10 minutes to reach Victoria Coach Station and certainly 15 minutes to reach Victoria Train Station and Victoria Underground Station. I'm personally not a fast walker, so it took me even some more time. But you can only reach the Victoria Coach Station in 3 minutes if you're a very well trained runner. At the end, I think it's not too bad for the price we've paid. Yes the hotel is quite dodgey and dull but don't expect a 5* room for a 2* price. If you want the service and the style, than you have to pay for it.", "Date": "November 16, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "LS25", "Title": "\u201cAbsolutely dreadful place.\u201d", "Author": "Corracrin", "ReviewID": "UR47572255", "Content": "This hotel was dangerous in terms of health and safety and fire regulations.
