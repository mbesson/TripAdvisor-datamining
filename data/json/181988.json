This hotel must be under renovation because the exterior and interior dont match what so ever. I stayed on the ground level in a 2 queen size bed suit, was very surprised with how great the room looked. Nothing too fancy but all the basics were there.. Only down side was that it cost 10$ to order a in room movie, while at the Marriott its only $5. This hotel has a nice looking but small indoor pool as well as a gym.. I got a great deal 65$ for the night, so it was by far worth it as Ive payed much more to stay at much worst places.", "Date": "March 22, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Timmins, Ontario", "Title": "\u201cGreat and helpful service\u201d", "Author": "Melbat3", "ReviewID": "UR125478140", "Content": "We stayed at this hotel overnight just prior to a trip to France for 2 weeks.

The staff were very friendly and welcoming. The room was a very good size. We had a good meal (a huge chicken spinach salad) in the hotel restaurant. The flights were coming in right over the hotel that night (very cool!) but stopped around 11 pm so we had a good night sleep. Very easy shuttle to the airport.

Check in was great; well organized and friendly staff. Hotel was clean and bright. Rooms were a great size, decorated nicely and had comfy beds & pillows. Attached to the hotel is a Perkins which is ideal for breakfast or family style food. Overall, I enjoyed my stay. No complaints. Great location with many restaurants, ie-suishi, moxies, milestones nearby if Perkins isn't what you are looking for. We ate at Perkins and staff were extremely friendly and food was good. I think many people will stay here who are flying out on vacation. I saw the Shuttle coming and going taking people to the airport. I didn't get a chance to use the pool but the hotel does have one.

I stayed here a couple of years ago prior to the recent renovations and I'm shocked at the transformation of this property. Beautiful lobby, friendly staff, and bright cheery atmosphere is what to expect. We stayed here prior to flying out on vacation a couple of weeks ago. Shuttle was on time, easy to use and completely a flawless process. It was nice for us to stay the night before flying out and being able to park at the hotel for the week. Staff throughout this property were always smiling, and welcoming. We had breakfast at Perkins which was perfect. Not one complaint. It was a refreshing send off to our much needed vacation. I'm thoroughly impressed with the holiday inn's new image!! They have brought class to an affordable stay. Rooms are a great size, and redecorated very modernly. Equipped with flat screen tv's and very comfy beds. I had to ask for extra towels which were delivered promptly. The only thing I would recommend is for the hotel to provide bathrobes. Our room didn't have any. I will defnately recommend this to friends and stay here again.", "Date": "February 13, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Walkerton, Canada", "Title": "\u201cVery nice\u201d", "Author": "funkynassau1", "ReviewID": "UR124362192", "Content": "We've stayed here a couple of times when flying out of Toronto.

Nice bathroom, they give you shampoo etc. Big screen tv, nice arm chair and ottoman, desk, office chair, data port for your computer. Fairly quiet considering it's almost at the airport.

Check-in was quick and the agent was very nice, plus, I used the shuttle service from and to the airport and both drivers were very professional and friendly. Note: for the return shuttle you need to let them know when checking in so they can give you a shuttle ticket. The room assigned to me was on floor two and it was spacious enough for one night though not as big as the one I had the previous year. It was room 237 and I think all the 37 rooms are the ones tucked away in the corner. The only drawback for this room if you have an extended stay is that unlike most of the rooms here with floor to ceiling windows, this one has a tiny window. The bathroom was down a little hallway close to the entry door. The advantage to this little hallway is that it provided distance from the main door so noise was not a problem at all, however, the heater was by the window and it never seemed to get to the bathroom resulting a cooler room to shower in. Overall, I would certainly stay here again for those quick nights when I have an early flight as the room and hotel was very clean. The restaurant did not look appealing though, but just a few mins of walking and there are other restaurants and a Timmies close by. The high speed wireless operated very well too.", "Date": "January 22, 2012"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Holiday Inn Toronto Airport East", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g155019-d181988-Reviews-Holiday_Inn_Toronto_Airport_East-Toronto_Ontario.html", "Price": "$116 - $153*", "Address": "<address> <span rel=\"v:address\"> <span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">600 Dixon Rd</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:locality\">Toronto</span>, <span property=\"v:region\">Ontario</span> <span property=\"v:postal-code\">M9W 1J1</span></span>, <span class=\"country-name\" property=\"v:country-name\">Canada</span> (Formerly The Toronto Airport Hotel)</span> </span> </address>", "HotelID": "181988", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/02/40/32/d5/lobby-with-logo.jpg"}}
