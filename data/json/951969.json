There is a nice wifi (no cap on data). People at the reception speaks a correct English.

On my last night there was even a couple who fight at each other. Therefore you really need not to have a light sleep.

Usually, I leave a good review, but the trend on the condition of the rooms is clearly in the wrong direction. There are lots of little things that would not be that difficult to fix, but don't get fixed. I have never had a room at this Mingle with shower water that would stay at warm. Set it how you want it and in a few seconds it is either too cold or two hot again. You get about 10 seconds at the right temperature. This time I got the same room as a few months ago, and the very same little things were not fixed. A strip of wall covering next to the mirror ripped off and staples exposed. The button in the shower to change from the hand wand to the overhead shower was missing, stuck in one position, and it just wouldn't take much to fix it. The tile over the toilet that probably covers the hot water heater is broken and held in place by a bunch of ugly black tape. Guys, at least get some tape that is the same color as the tile!

Our 2 nights in Mingle on the Wing was about \u20ac136 all in, absolutely great value. Located in Central, only minutes walk from everything, including the Ferry terminal to Macau/Shenzhen/Mainland - our reason for choosing it as we had luggage. Also on metro line - a few doors down, and easy to get to Hong Kong airport and Kowloon etc. Hotel is REALLY small, does not offer any sort of breakfast, and the rooms are absolutely TINY. Do not underestimate how small they are - not a lot bigger that what you would find on a passenger ferry. The standard double is too small really for 2 people with luggage, and a little claustrophoic but its do-able for 1 or 2 nights. You really cannot swing a cat in the rooms, and my husband and I had to keep getting out of eachother's way to get dressed or to get at things. The hotel is modern though, and very well decorated and clean and tidy with friendly staff. Bathrooms again, are very small, but this place is definitely worth it for what you pay - a place to lay your head down at night. Next time I stay here I would probably ask for a suite though. I think it would be worth paying that little bit extra for more space, especially for 2 people with luggage, and definitely for any kind of extended stay beyond 2 nights.

I was drawn by their location (genuinely 1 minute from Sheung Wan MTR station exit A2), the fact they had single rooms (and so wouldn't be paying for a non-existent second guest) and their reasonable price for the Wednesday night in question (although the rate was due to drop even lower after the weekend which I have since found out was because Friday was a Chinese holiday and there was also a conference on that weekend). Unlike some of the other recent visitors, I couldn't have been happier with my choice. I was expecting a small room and this was what I got, but as I wanted a simple, safe place to rest my weary head, it served its purpose. The room also had a safe (a pleasant surprise) and whoever said the shower was too small obviously didn't spot the overhead drench option and only used the wall-mounted one, because as someone who is 5ft11, that was most definitely high enough for me to fit under. Bizarrely, for a single room, it would have comfortably fitted two people in it too. The internet is fast (with indiviudal routers apparently in each room) and although I had a slight issue with the entertainment system upon check-in, this was resolved as requested whilst I was out exploring the nearby area. I was so happy with the place in fact that having spent a couple of nights in Macau and another night elsewhere in HK (see other reviews), I snapped up a Lite room for my last 3 nights in HK at the very reasonable price of 400HKD per night and is where I am whilst typing this review. If anything, I actually prefer this room as it is long and thin rather than square and so am able to hide my suitcase on a bench on the side. Once again there's a slight issue with the entertainment system, but once it is up and running again, I'll have an incredible selection of films to choose from and with something so ambitious and complex, I was expecting there might be the odd teething problem. I would have no hesitation in staying here again (hence I already am) and would highly recommend the hotel for any solo travellers visiting the city.

Wanted to stay in HK island for a change and decided to settle for this since its so convenient and near the MTR. We are a group of 3, so we took the Deluxe Double Room. The Deluxe didnt sound or look that deluxe though, the room was too small to be called Deluxe, but enough for 3 of our luggages to be placed on the floor with ample walking space. Room condition was bad. Everything, from the desk to looks old and because of that it looks dirty to us too. The aircon was old and extremely noisy too. Luckily the bed was clean. The lift was right outside our room and it can be really noisy when other guests come back or are going out. The bathroom was in quite a terrible state. The holder holding the shower looks as if it's going to drop off anytime. Everytime after we showered, the floor will be wet even though we closed the glass door. There wasnt enough space for our toiletries and no space to hang our clothes in the bathroom when bathing, it's just really small! Hot water didnt worked on one of the nights until we alerted the staff. The fridge is almost close to useless as it is not cold at all. We bought our own drinks/milk and put them in the fridge, and it turned bad just over the night in the next morning. Why bother to put a fridge there when it doesnt even serve the purpose?! The best thing about Mingle is the free wifi access it offers. It let us stay connected with friends and family and is convenient when we need access to the internet. I also love that the 7-11 is just a few steps away from the hotel, its really really convenient. Not forgetting the close distance to Sheung Wan MTR, it makes it all up for the condition and size of the room. No complains about the staff. They are helpful. If the management of Mingle on the Wing could spent a little to improve and refurbish their rooms, Im sure it will be beneficial to them in the long run given the ideal location of their establishment. I personally do not mind small rooms, small rooms can be cozy too, but at least they have to be in good decent condition. Im not sure about their other rooms, but the Deluxe Double room we were in is REALLY old and run-down! Im not sure if I would be back to Mingle on the Wing again. If Im travelling solo or in pairs, I may consider since the location is really good. But for a group of 3, its not quite advisable to stay in Mingle.

I remember my first review of Mingle on the Wing back in 2009 and it had brought significant readership and followers from my blog which many took an interest and stayed at the hotel. Having said that, my reason for staying in Mingle is definitely due to the location, which is in Sheung Wan. The sure way of saving taxi fare is to hop on the Airport Express Train that cost around HK$70 (Est US$9) to transit at Central MTR, pay another HK$24 to Sheung Wan MTR (Last stop on the Island Line in Blue). The nearest walk to the hotel is by exiting \"A2\" and try to look out for 7-11. Its just a quick 3 mins diagonally across. I never do like to comment on unpleasantness of the staff bearing in mind that they still need to keep their jobs but that particular trio on shift, showed no interest or hospitality on their faces. I was allocated to a room, which was directly in front of the lift and what made it even uncomfortable was that the bed was directly facing the main door and lift door. In chinese feng shui, one should never have their feet facing directly the main door, as it signifies the 'coffin position'. I was ill throughout my stay and was little disturbed by the chattering of the chambermaids due to the close proximity to the next room and thin walls. As mentioned by another reader, the bed takes up pretty 95% of the sleeping area and that, my friend, is absolutely true. It is unusual for me to switch loyalties and find a new place or environment to stay in but I think I've outgrown my time with Mingle and unless you upgrade to an Executive or Deluxe Room, which I was unable to upgrade as it was full.

Pros: the main pro is the location. You can see the Hotel's entrance from the Sheung Wan metro (MTR) exit - it's a 60 second walk. If you're not familiar with Hong Kong, being so close to an MTR station is great. You can be anywhere in Hong Kong within a quick, cheap and easy ride on the metro. That being said, the location is also good enough that you can walk to plenty of the key places, including Soho (10 mins), the Central Ferry Terminal (10 mins) etc. There's a Starbucks around the corner, plus a 7-11, restaurants, ATMs etc all on the same block. In short, it's right in the heart of Hong Kong island. - other pros include fast (and free) wifi in each room, plus a big TV, DVD player and even a decent sound system, funnily enough. Also, the staff all speak decent English and will help with directions, restaurant bookings, recommendations etc. The cleaning staff did a great job every day, and we left our laptops, cell phones, passports etc on the bed when we went out, without any problems. Cons: the standard rooms are clean and modern, but tiny. Seriously tiny. Like novelty size. The bed takes up about 95% of the floor space. For us this wasn't a problem, as we were out exploring most days and nights, so it was fine to return to the room and sleep/recover and watch TV in bed. But if you have other plans, this might be a factor for you. The bathroom was also tiny, but clean and modern. - The price for New Years Eve (A$400+ p/night) seemed crazy given the size of the room, but this was the cheapest room just about anywhere on Hong Kong island for that time, so we can't complain.

If you book on a last minute hotel website you can get rooms for about HK$400-500 (around US$50-60). As between the Mingle on the Wing and Mingle by the Park, the former is better located if you are planning on taking a visit to Macau as it is very close to the Macau Ferry Terminal (walking distance).

My paperwork said we would have twin beds for my daughter and I, but we were given two beds pushed together as a king size bed and crammed into a room with literally a one foot wide aisle on one side of the bed. It really was the size of a walk-in closet and felt claustrophobic. One of the sliding wooden window shades was off track so if you slid it to a certain spot it could fall on your head while sleeping. The ceiling-mounted A.C. vent was stuck almost shut so no air circulated, so I had to stand on my tippy-toes on the edge of the bed and was just barely able to pull it down into place. After several hours I also discovered the A.C. remote had no batteries so that was why the A.C. was not cooling the room. I also did not appreciate several black hairs on the bathroom floor, which had the appearance that it had not been washed or not washed well. I scooped them up before my teenage daughter saw them and was grossed out on what we had planned to be a special getaway for the two of us. There was a nice flat-screen television but the dvd player, music system and 200 movies library advertised on the website as a highlight of their rooms did not work. Our dvd came out in black and white and had no sound. The lady at the front desk kindly tried to get it to work but she is a desk clerk, not an electrician. She told us the second day that the dvd player was fixed, but now it only played the music track of dvds, no speaking at all. I told them it still didn\u2019t work. The desk clerk was apologetic, but it was never fixed nor did we ever have any of the music or 200 movies advertised on the website. So instead of having enjoyable movie nights we scrounged around their 3 English-speaking television channels and found a Discovery channel program of skinning seals and a sappy Mom\u2019s Cooking program. The electrical outlet is crammed way back inside a cupboard shelf that is about 5 inches tall so it is impossible to use the electric teapot which is placed on the shelf above it. Fortunately I found another outlet hidden on the tv table to boil water. Our second evening there, while we were in our room still trying to get that dvd system to work, apparently our phone was not working because my husband tried to call in several times and was told by the front desk that my daughter and I were not back to our rooms yet \u2013 causing him unnecessary worry that we were not back yet when we were. Our last morning as I hurried around to boil water for coffee and use my hair straightener, all the electric outlets in our room stopped working. This also meant that when I returned from getting something at the store for my daughter who had the stomach flu, the room's doorbell and also key system did not work so she had to get up from her sick bed to let me in. They did fix it when I notified them, but this was one too many of a series of poor upkeep on this property. On the positive side, it is very convenient to the subway. The bed was comfortable. One or two of the front desk clerks tried hard to help. The bathroom looked like it had been redone and was in some ways larger than the bedroom \u2013 but there was no place to put things so it still felt inconvenient. The neighborhood was good and the hotel was quiet. Mingle on the Wing looked like a place where my daughter and I could build some special memories together. We did build some memories, but not the kind I imagined. Thankfully we chose to see the unique humor of living in a closet, the repeated failed attempts to get the dvd system to work, and all the other things that if we didn\u2019t laugh we would cry over \u2013 but I will remember what appeared to me to be the shoddy management and upkeep of what could be a very nice hotel.

Also, there was free internet on 2 computers at the reception, which is always a plus as I'm aware that still most hotels literally rob your wallet when it comes to using their internet facilities. Now why do I mention that it's good for shorter people? Two reasons: - The room was really so small that we joked 'Oh dear, one of us is definitely going to trip over the suitcase at some point.' 15 minutes later, the man did exactly that. And I had a good laugh at him, before going through exactly the same the next day. - The beds! Before I go into this, my disclaimer: I'm half Hong Kong Chinese, and I LOVE my country of origin and its people. However it must be noted that the Chinese are often not the tallest people on the planet. Therefore, some establishments will have thought of this, some won't, or some don't have the space to. We think Mingle On The Wing falls under the third category, as there was just no way a longer bed could fit into the room. My partner, standing 6\" tall (1.83 m), had his feet and ankles firmly sticking out when lying down. I could just about fit in with my 5.6\" (1.70 m). He didn't mind too much, but admits that it's not too comfortable and will be looking for possibly a western chain hotel for the next visit. If you're staying for just a few nights and are as tall or taller, it's doable but not any longer. The only other concern we had was that in our room at least, there was only one tiny window above our bed which did not allow for viewing outside. So if you really feel the need to be able to look outside, this isn't the place for you. Mind you, should you not be staying in one of the spectacular 5 star hotels in the city, you're more often going to be treated to looking into another flat rather than any stunning city views anyhow. DO keep this in mind when travelling to a place like Hong Kong. The views always come with a price tag! All in all, if you're my height or shorter, and if your main value is a decent location for a stopover, yes, it's fine. However, if you're staying more than 2-3 nights, have a lot of luggage and/or if you're my partners height, consider staying at any of the many western chains found throughout Hong Kong Island and Kowloon, should you have the budget.", "Date": "November 25, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Canberra", "Title": "\u201cSmall but great location\u201d", "Author": "Ramblinman101", "ReviewID": "UR79015605", "Content": "When I booked this place online I really wasn't sure what I would get.

Yes the room was small, but apparently just about every room in HK is, and it was big enough to fit the three of us in nicely. The location is excellent. A minutes walk from the front door to the entrance of the Shwuen Wan MTR station (HK is SO EASY on the MTR), 15 minute walk to the Victoria Peak tram, and the food......the best Asian food IMHO is the \"hole in the wall\" and there are plenty of those nearby. About 5 minutes walk to Lin Heung, one of the best Chinese restuarants in the city. One small issue is the air conditioning. The temperature must drop about 10 degrees as you walk in the front door. That's nice, but it's a bit of a shock to the system when you walk back outside into the 30+ C / 90% humdity. It's like that on the MTR as well - lots of great air conditioning, but remember you will have to go outside some time. Great free WI-Fi, very fast. Two English speaking TV stations that I could find, plus Asian Channel V. Staff were great, and we kept our luggage in the foyer for free on check out day (7:30pm flight).

The gentleman in the room was equally confused, and he called the reception to tell them about the mix-up. I returned downstairs and was asked to wait. No explanation was given by the staff about why my room was already occupied. Fifteen minutes later, one of the staff told me my room's ready and escorted me upstairs to the 9th floor, and back to the same room I was given earlier. The male guest who had earlier occupied the room was moved to the room next door. I didn't know if he had entered the wrong room by mistake (although as to how he could have entered my room with another room's key card, I had no idea), or if the staff had given the both of us the same room key.

I complained to the staff at the reception, but again, no apology or explanation was given. That evening, I decided to leave the hotel and move to another one. I'm a woman travelling alone, and I felt that my safety was being compromised at Mingle.

Also, the clock radio in my room went off at random times throughout the night. I'm not a light sleeper, but I didn't manage to get any sleep at all in Mingle. You'd have to be dead to sleep through the noise. All in all, I will not recommend staying at this hotel unless you don't mind putting your own safety at risk or dealing with ignorant staff who don't seem to understand much English.

A trip to Hong Kong was such a nice trip,\"Mingle on The Wing\" gave me a nice place to get sleep. I have been to Hong Kong to take a sit for the US nursing license examination with Pearson Test Center at Grand Millennium Plaza locates in Central Island and because I like travelling myself,so I prefer to hire a safe, clean and convenient place for my relaxation period and more important in style to be fit. I like \"Mingle on The Wing\" as it could give me most of what I want, good location just one minute walk from Sheung Wan, MRT station to get anywhere else around this island. To see most of attractions is not so difficult in minimal expense. I met \"Mingle\" at \"Wotif.com\" after I had been searching all around from other websites for 3 night stay on 21-23 April. I realise at first from theirs photos that this hotel is not a type of \"stand alone building hotel\" as many hotels I have seen.I also got some reviews about it here before,however after I had a look in details I finally decided to book \"standard room\" in advance. I arrived in HK around 9 pm,after getting \"Airport Express\" to travel to HK station to reach Central Exit, although I could then get the hotel by MRT but I tried a taxi which is $ 18 for 5 minutes. When I checked in at the hotel,the 'Standard room\" I had been booking was not available the staff who speaks English quiet well upgraded me to \"Superior type\" without any more payment for the first night. The photos about them I have attached with this review you can compare for yourself. Including a short distance to Grand Millennium for my test, I also easily had much of time to visit \"The Giant Buddha\" at Nging Ping Village by Nging Ping Cable Car, walk around Central Area in Soho, Take a ferry to Kowloon, Try a Peak Tram to have a fresh breath on the top of HK at Peak Tower where I got many nice souvenirs back to Thailand for my friends. Nearby the hotel, there are two \"7 eleven\", qualified restaurants for tourists, fresh fruits shop for collecting, after daily trip I love hot shower at room,enjoy LCD TV + Bloomberg,Discovery and Fox channel in nice and clean bed without any allergies. The rooms in Mingle do not have strong smell, the light and security systems are perfect, I felt safe and really had nice sleep through all three nights. Yes!

We wanted to stay in Central rather than the hotels in Kowloon so we could be close to everything and within walking distance. We couldn't believe the value for money of the hotel in AUD$ - and were nervous about what to expect. To say we were pleasantly surprised was an understatement. We were in standard double on the 11th floor. The bedroom itself was very small with about 0.5 metres or less around the king bed - this was basically the room so we had to be patient with the suitcase storage and be pretty tidy when we were there. The bathroom is a reasonable size with a really good shower. All the electrical stuff worked well - we didn't have any problems at all. The decor is in the boutique hotel mode - clean, crisp and modern feeling. Just beware of the building work - we were wlong at about 715 am witha thud thud noise that sounded like it was in the area and the bed/room actually shook a little - it lasted for about 20 - 30 mins. Talking to family linving on the Island they said they also felt it (in SoHo) and it was a development where the foundations were getting put in. The mornings after we were less disturbed and got back to slep pretty quickly after. Its location is also fantastic - walking distance to the Macau and Kowloon ferry terminals, plus the MTR, plus main shopping strip etc. If you want to relax in your hotel room a lot during your trip you might want to go for somewhere further out and bigger but we were up and out everyday so it was perfect for us. If you are travelling alone and can afford it we would recommend going for a double room to give you a bit more space (based on the reviews of the single rooms) It is also in an area that still has a really Chinese/ Old Hong Kong feel and smell.

However, Mingle on the Wing turned out to be much better than I expected and I truely enjoyed my stay with them. The first thing I noticed was the location. WOW! The hotel is extremely close to a MTR stataion. Unlike the other hotel, this time I only had to walk for 30 seconds after leaving the MTR station, and that is great for me as I had 3 big luggages. The lady at the reception (Matty) was very polite, very friendly and extremely helpful. As my room wasn't ready, she asked me to leave my luggages behind her desk and she even carefully labelled all my bags for me. After a good walk around the hotel area, I came back to the hotel and was able to check in before the actual check-in time. My room was on the 8th floor and I was totally blown away when I first saw it. First of all, the door was locked electronically with a magnetic card so I felt safe inside the room (unlike the other hotel which only uses hand locks). The intensity of all lights were controlled by an electronic switch on the wall so you don't have to spend time looking for different switches. You can also choose whether you would like room services on the switch which was cool. The room was elegant, posh and sparkling clean with a foot rest and I was able to use the free high speed internet like they said. The room also had a 37\" LCD TV, a fridge and a big open window. I actually booked and paid for a single room, but Matty managed to upgrade me to a bigger room with a double bed. The toilet was very clean with all the supplies I needed (the other hotel didn't even give me a soap). And there were two strong showers for me to choose from, rain-type and normal - I used both! There were other facilities that I didn't use so I can't comment on them, but they all looked very good: DVD player, Cordless IP Phone with Skype, Free Wi-Fi & In-room Surround Sound System. I would like to thank Mingle on the Wing to make my stay so enjoyable, so enjoyable that I had to come and give them a good review on tripadvisor.com.

But, it has Technology Gone Wild. You can use the TV and remote control to set the air conditioning, turn the lights off and on (and select mood lighting), tune the TV, watch movies, listen to the radio, among other things. It would be great if it all worked flawlessly, but it doesn't. On two out of my five nights there, all the lights in the room suddenly turned on, waking me up. I guess there's some short-circuit somewhere in my room, but how will they ever find it? To turn on the TV and tune to channel 9 took 12 key presses on the remote control. The TV volume was fine, but when I tried to watch a movie from their online collection, there was no volume. The very helpful girl from the front desk fixed it, but the next day I had the same problem. It would just be better to have equipment that works, instead of making things so complicated. There is no lightweight blanket in the room, only a thick comforter. This requires you to set the air conditioning temperature very low to be able to sleep in comfort. Seems kind of wasteful on their part, since most businesses like to keep energy costs low. The mirror in the bathroom is not in front of you. It's mounted on the wall to the side of the sink. Every time you shave, brush your teeth or put on makeup, you have to lean uncomfortably over the sink and look to your left to see yourself. Because of poor lighting, one side of your face is lit up more than the other, which makes shaving or makeup difficult. They should have mounted the mirror on a hinge so it could swing to a position in front of you. Otherwise, the bathroom is a good size and very attractive. In fact, the shower stall is oversized compared to the rest of the room. Ladies, there's no full-length mirror. There is an utter lack of space to put anything. This was a glaring oversight on the part of the planners at the hotel. This could have been avoided by simply putting the mattress on a platform raised a foot or two off the floor, thereby providing empty space under the bed. Such space is handy and critical in a room of this size. Just being able to slide your suitcase underneath the bed, along with shoes, shopping bags, etc., would be a great help to guests trying not to trip over their belongings. There is a tiny closet next to the bed, with a 10 inch wide pathway to reach it. You have to be on your knees (on the bed) to access the closet. There were four rooms on my floor. The springs that close the doors are so strong that it takes a concious effort to not let your door slam (and some guests don't make that effort). The cleaning woman was the worst offender, making all sorts of noise. There is a new high-rise building going up a block or two away. This may annoy light sleepers, or those who like to sleep late. On most days, though, the noise wasn't that bad. There are 2 free laptops in the lobby to use for internet. This is very valuable, since I didn't see any other place to use the internet in this neighborhood. They apparently have free wireless internet in the rooms, which I didn't use. A warning to people that are using a credit card issued outside of Hong Kong to pay your bill here: The hotel's credit card processing machine will convert the Hong Kong dollars to the currency of the country where your card is issued. This doesn't sound all bad, but they are not using the exchange rate provided by your credit card company. They choose an exchange rate that favors the hotel, and you will end up paying more (interestingly, about enough to cover the fees they pay their bank for accepting credit cards). I spent at least half an hour talking to hotel employees about this, and they even got their bank on the phone to talk to me. I wanted to pay in Hong Kong dollars so that Visa would determine the exchange rate, and the solution the bank came up with is to use the old-fashioned credit card imprinter, rather than the electronic one. I don't appreciate the way they are manipulating the exchange rate to charge more. Everywhere else in Hong Kong I used my Visa card, the sales slip always came up in HK Dollars. At this hotel, nobody knows the button to press on the machine to make that happen. I would urge anyone traveling overseas to always refuse having the sales slip prepared in their home currency, as every time this has been offered to me, it has always been in the merchant's favor, sometimes by as much as US$20. Insist that you be charged in the local currency, and let Visa, MasterCard or American Express determine the exchange rate. This hotel even shows the exchange rate on the receipt, not as the very familiar 7.75 rate between the HK Dollar and the US Dollar, but as the inverse 0.132973. Presenting the exchange rate in this manner makes it impossible to quickly evaluate the exchange rate they are using. Service from the front desk employees is not consistent. Some are much more fluent in English than others. Some are very helpful, and some are not. You'll find the best ones very quickly. My room had a window, but some apparently do not. I think they have a room category called \"Lite\", and these are the lowest priced rooms with no window. Excellent public transit, as it's only a block from the Sheung Wan Subway Station (from this station, take exit A2, go up stairs to street, turn right and the hotel is about a block away). I took the airport train to Central Station, then it's only one subway station away. No need to take a taxi unless you have lots of luggage. Overall, I found the hotel to be attractive and conveniently located. Although my review may sound negative, I don't want to make the hotel sound like a bad place, because it isn't. It just could have a been a much nicer experience. I would stay there again only if I got a low rate, otherwise I would do some more hotel shopping.

We booked a 5-night stay and EVERY day (yes 5 times) we complained that the room was cold and there was no heater. The first time the receptionist said it would be too hard as they'd have to find a heater factory!!?! I suggested they just go buy a HK$150 heater from a shop, but that seemed to make no sense to him. The staff seemed to rotate to new staff almost every day. The next 3 people over 4 days (to whom we complained about the heating) all seemed very concened that we were cold and assured us they would have the aircon fixed (apparetly the heat output on it was broken, apart from the fact that it had a secondary fault where it would never turn on in the first place without a technician resetting something in the hall cupboard). On the final day one of the earlier staff members said she had previously ordered a technician and didn't know what had happened. She assured us that she would chase it up, ...but it still was not fixed. They probably fixed it the day we checked out, as if that is of any use to us... So all in all we were very cold in our (HK$730/night) room!! Absolutely unforgivable, a backpackers would have provided a cheap and effective heater, so why can't a mid-range hotel do it?? We had to wear long sleeves and long pants when we were not in bed. 2. The room was TINY - shoebox sized. At first I thought this was just a Hong Kong standard but then we moved to a slightly cheaper (and far nicer) hotel very close by and got a room almost 3 times the size for less money and of a higher standard. At Wing On Lok we paid for a \"Deluxe Room\" as opposed to a standard room, so I expected some space, it was so small that I had to do my morning exercises (push ups, yoga) on the bed! 3. There was no wifi service in our room, despite this \"tech-hotel\" bragging that wifi is \"everywhere\" in the hotel. I got zero bars and could not establish a proper connection. To be fair, there was a CAT5 connection but this meant being tied to the (tiny) desk so I could not use my laptop in bed which would have been a lot more comfortable at times. 4. The AV system was still not complete (hence not working at all apart from the TV), despite the hotels advertisement claiming it would be ready for February (we stayed Feb 12-17). There was no DVD played and I could not plug in my MP3 player. 5. The reception staff member when we checked in (late) could not speak more than a few words of English, In addition he had no concept of trying to communicate in other ways (sign language etc..) although the latter seems to be a trait of all HongKongese. 6. Although this did not matter to me, the hotels advert was all about personal service - but there was none of this whatsoever, larger hotels have always been far more personal. Reception couldn't even give (or even sell) me a map of Hong Kong!", "Date": "February 19, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Sydney", "Title": "\u201cGood budget find in a convenient location\u201d", "Author": "Cucques", "ReviewID": "UR12827635", "Content": "We got a good rate for our room by booking online - it was a four day consecutive rate. HK$490 per night. It was a standard room ie. the basic one. Room - Tiny but we had expected it as this is Hong Kong and we had also chosen the cheapest room, rather than going for a superior, deluxe or otherwise (as we knew we were going to be out most of the time). Basically, we had a queen sized bed which took up most of the room. Having said that, everything was brand new, modern and the room was very clean. The bathroom had a shower (no bathtub), was modern and compact but had enough room. We also had an LCD TV and wifi. Liked the fact that you could switch off the aircon and open the windows. Location - Brilliant - metres away from the A2 exit of Sheung Wan MTR (underground) station. Central is a stroll away too. There are many local cafes in the area for breakfast, laundry/dry cleaning shops, a 7/11 a couple of doors down. HK Airport Express station is a short taxi drive away. Service - Perfectly fine. Overall we thought that the value was good, despite the size of the room, due to the location/convenience and price.", "Date": "January 20, 2008"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Mingle Place On The Wing", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g294217-d951969-Reviews-Mingle_Place_On_The_Wing-Hong_Kong.html", "Price": "$81 and up*", "Address": "<address><span rel=\"v:address\"><span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">No.105 Wing Lok Street, Sheung Wan</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:locality\">Hong Kong</span></span>, <span class=\"country-name\" property=\"v:country-name\">China</span> </span></span></address>", "HotelID": "951969", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/ProviderThumbnails/dirs/e5/18/e518067c7a9ff9c2e6871df3ee3be5431large.jpg"}}
