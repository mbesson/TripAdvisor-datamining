We went to Rome on a short notice 4 day vacation. We used points for this hotel and rally didn't know where it was. However it's very close o the airport.....lot so much to the city center though.nwhen we got to the hotel we realized we'd have to take the shuttle into the city center everyday. At 20euro round trip for 2 people, it can get pricey quickly. But the shuttle oes drop you right by Castel San Angelo, just about 6 minutes walk to the Vatican, and minutes from all the other main attractions other than the Coloseum. The hotel room was great, it was off season so the pool was closed. Eat in the city, the hotel is pricey and not many options. Do your research before you go, the concierge is ok but doesn't always have the information you need. Nice to come back and relax in a big hotel room, rather than small one in the city.

Huge faceless conference hotel miles from anywhere\u201d", "Author": "LouiseKennedy", "ReviewID": "UR126359690", "Content": "I was here on a conference so I wasnt paying the bill - but if I was I would have been dreadfully disappointed if I thought I was coming to Rome. From the outside it looks like a prison - high security fencing reminds you that this is not a great area - but its a Marriott so it must be good mustn't it?? Well not really. However the bedrooms are very good - the marriot trademark beds are wonderfully comfortable and a strange bathroom arrangement - one room with bath and basin, other with shower loo and basin, actually works well when two people are trying to get ready at the same time. Bar drinks very expensive as you would expect, but normally you have the option of going elsewhere, however here you are completely captive - there is nothing to walk to at all and if you want to go to the 'nearest' restaurant you still need to get cabs (but it is excellent and a fraction of eating at the hotel so well worth it) or its a 40 minute taxi ride into the city. If you are on business then the decision has probably already been made for you, and as a conference hotel it does what it has to - its huge and impersonal and expensive. But if you are an independant traveller and want to see Rome then stay in Rome - this is not a tourist hotel. The weather was lovely while we were there but there was nowhere to sit out - the lovely gardens around the pool were gated and locked despite it being 30 degrees, so apart from a small number of chairs outside the bar area the only other option was to pay to go into the spa from which you have access to a very small garden area with sun chairs and trees - but for someone wanting an hour in the fresh air between meetings there is nothing at all - its quite incredible. This hotel is firmly bottom of my list of hotels I would choose to return to.

I love Rome but being close to the conference was more important for me on this trip * The hotel restaurant was DREADFUL. In Italy I love the relaxed service and great food. Unfortunately this hotel restaurant specialised in terrible service and abysmal food. The pasta was ok but it would take in excess of an hour to get a plate of it. On the evening they ran out of chicken (...?) I opted for the scallops. The scallops turned up an hour after the pasta and were grey and rubbery on a bed of mushy over-wilted greens. I attempted to eat them but gave up for fear of food poisoning and didn't have the will to wait another hour for a replacement so I gave up and had them removed from the bill.

I forgot to mention that there is also an airport shuttle that charges \u20ac20 for the ride from the Fiumicino to the hotel but since the pick up schedule said there was a 3-hour gap from noon to 3pm when the shuttle is not operating - and this is when we had just landed, we decided not to wait that long and just took a taxi instead. The taxi cost was a total of \u20ac35 for that same short ride. The hotel is located out in the quiet suburbs right next to a modern apartment complex on a hill -- the views are pretty decent and you definitely feel that you are away from the hustle and bustle of the city. The hotel has lots of conventions happening all year round. The rooms were pretty impressive -- very clean, classic decor, there were 2 bathrooms in our room -- kind of odd, but one had the toilet and bidet along with a shower and sink, and the other had a large bathtub and a sink. Both bathrooms have towel warmers -- such an awesome treat! I didn't care much for my door lock though, as I had to really slam the door in order for it to lock. I would however highly recommend this hotel if you don't mind the fact that it's definitely not within walking distance to all the history that The Eternal City has to offer its many visitors.", "Date": "September 25, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Amsterdam, The Netherlands", "Title": "\u201cNo in-room wifi = disqualifier\u201d", "Author": "Teters-NL", "ReviewID": "UR118541557", "Content": "I have spend one night in this hotel, which is situated in a kind of office park area on a hill with (in my case) a view on the highways around it.

A reasonably priced shuttle \u2026 Conveniently located \u2026 ideal for \u2026 tourism in Rome.\" This is very misleading, as the hotel is in the middle of no where. There is a 30+ minute, 10 Euro per person, Marriott shuttle bus that drops at a not-so-convenient location in city center. The bus ran every 2 hours (not always on time) and is sometimes overbooked (not available at a convenient time). Thus, it is unrealistic to travel into Rome more than once a day. You are trapped far from the city center. There is no place to eat, except at the Marriott, where breakfast was about 24 Euros per person. Internet is an extra charge of about 24 Euros per day or 7,50 per hour. I was offered the \"special deal\" of breakfast for two and free internet in the Executive Lounge for about 70 Euro per day. We chose to be \"unconnected\" over being fleeced. The indoor pool had a 10 Euro per person cost. I did not see any of these fees disclosed on the website. The free outdoor pool closed at 8p when it got dark at 9:30p. I used points for this unpleasant experience. What a waste. It would have been a better to stay in town, or simply near any metro/train station, at almost any cost. Just add up the above fees for two people! We traveled for a month in Europe and stayed at many well-located, 3-star hotels that were more pleasant at a much lower cost, with Internet and breakfast included (free). The room wasn't much bigger, the shower didn't drain any better, and the staff was not helpful. The check-out line was longer than 10 minutes. The d\u00e9cor was ostentatious. The orange marble in the bathroom was overwhelming. The mini-bar is rigged so if you open the fridge and something falls out, you get charged a ridiculous fee if it not replaced in 15 seconds. We rode the public bus to the metro/train station and the trip into Rome was about an hour. And, given that you can \"get off\" at any city metro stop, it is probably shorter than the shuttle bus (because you can get off at your desired destination and do not have to walk / taxi). Certainly much cheaper. You can take the bus (about 10 minutes) to the commuter train at Muratella and get to the airport in 20 minutes. The bus/metro/train runs frequently (except on Sundays) and is not a bad experience \u2013 no matter how much the Marriott personnel try to talk you into the over-priced, inconvenient shuttles. Instead of the Marriott Rome stay being a pleasant \"finale\" for our European vacation, the lodging is a bad memory. I cannot emphasize enough the inconvenience of this location and the outrageous prices. As you plan a Rome vacation, remember that the public transportation is excellent. As long as you are near a metro stop, you can get to almost any tourist location quick and easy. We felt safe, even at night.

Consider not taking the hotel bus for 3 Euro each way: instead, get a Rome 3 day transit pass or a combined pass for the busses/trains and sights for much less if you plan to stay in Rome few days. The transit pass gets you on the suburban commuter train which is just a block or so away from the hotel and the communiter train takes you to a transfer point in Rome with access to all of the sights.

As such it attracts a lot of conventions and tradeshows and many of those attending are on expense accounts so cost is not an issue. The hotel property is beautiful, very grand and spacious, probably on par with a 4-5 star property in town. This is a high class property but not catering to tourists. As another reviewer mentioned the restaurant is way overpriced - the \u20ac36 buffet is totally not worth it. If you are a Marriott rewards member the Executive room in the basement has limited food and drinks and 2 computers for internet access but you have to get a password from the business office which is a PITA. Internet access from your actual room costs I think \u20ac7/day which we didn't use, opting for the free access in basement. We just ate in town and grabbed snacks from the Executive room. That said getting to/from Rome is not a big deal, sure you could take a cab at \u20ac30 each way or take the once-every-2-hour-drop-you-off-away-from-everything shuttle at \u20ac12pp but we found taking the local commuter train was relatively convenient (and most importantly inexpensive). Just buy a combo bus/train/metro ticket from the tobacco store in the lobby (\u20ac1/pp each way) then walk about 200 yards across the parking lot to catch a bus, route 127 I think. About 5 minutes away it drops you off at the Muratella station, trains come every 15 minutes during the day, 30 minutes nights and weekends. If you don't speak Italian and are unsure when you get on the bus just say \"Muratella\" to the driver- he/she will understand and stop the bus at the station. Take the commuter train to one of the stations that intersect with one of the Rome metro subways, we usually used Ostiense, then jump onto the Metro to get to the sights. About 45 minutes total transit time on average so you lose what, 25 minutes, from using a taxi. Since we were in Rome for several days we bought a BTI tourist pass 3 days for \u20ac11, this let us ride every form of public transportation instead of having to buy tickets each way.

There was a bright light that shone once a minute, and it seemed to be coming from far away outside the hotel compound. There was also a noise coming from inside the hotel that you could hear with your head on the pillow, probably some noise related to the infrastructure of the hotel. The breakfast served was nice, though not quite up to the 5-star level you'd expect in Europe.

First the good news is that is a beautiful hotel and the rooms are great. The food is only fair and very very expensive. An expresso is 3 Euro standing at the bar (normally in town 1 Euro). A glass of wine at their mediocre restaurant was 9Euro. The food was very expensive with pasta about 12-14 Euros and meat and fish courses about 25-30Euros (it was only fair in quality to boot). The worst thing is the location which cannot be overstated!!! The staff is not helpful to get you where you would like to go. The hotel is not near anything!!! You need a car and that isn't so good. There are packs of wild dogs near the hotel towards the bus stop so walking around is a \"hazard\" . There is a No. 128 bus about 2 blocks from the lobby which the staff discourage you from taking. It gets you to the Muratello train station (FR!) which gets you to the city via Ostensie station(20 minutes) and the metro. BUT the bus stops about 50 meters from the train station on a road without sidewalks!!!! The train station is totally isolated and you would have to call a cab via your own phone (no payphones there). There is no ticket office in such suburban stations. The next problem is that the station maybe dangerous at night the are many gypsies taking the train and I suspect they live there. They regularly \"beg\" on this train (annoying but trivial). Down the hill on which the hotel is placed there are apartments being built and a small shopping area about a 20 minute walk (which maybe safe. I saw no dogs on this side of the hill). There is a terrific lunch place (the Lunch Kitchen which was great and cheap but only open for lunch. There is a great paticceria and bar as well and 2 pizza restaurants which are small,cheap and OK. There is a small supermarket as well. The hotel doesn't even tell guests about these stores which is a shame since they offer true local color. The people in the bar and lunch restuarant were wonderful!!!\\ A car is absolutely mandatory but the GPS which is also mandatory was wrong in trying to get to a large mall about 5 miles from the hotel. The hotel is about 20 minutes from the airport which is convenient except during traffic and accidents add anywhere from 30 minutes or more. One fix albeit expensive is to get a car drive to the airport and park and take the express train to central rome. (parking plus the 11 euro train is expensive) but a cab from the hotel to Rome is probably 50 Euros and up depending on the traffic. This hotel has a convention center which is the reason to stay there. The rooms are nice but when in Rome stay in Rome!!!! Beware of the wild dogs on the property. You will see them if you stray outside the formal hotel boundaries. I am not exaggerating about the location which is terrible and the food which is expensive and very average. If you are adventurous taking the No 128 bus to Muratello station which runs early to late is a solution but keep some mace nearby for later night returns (I am not kidding).

The best way to avoid being disappointed is to think of your stay as a stint at a very fancy prison. There is nothing worth visiting anywhere near the hotel: no restaurants, shops, parks, or other businesses. To get into central Rome, you must either ride the hotel shuttle (which only leaves eight times a day) to Piazza Cavour for six euro, or spend 25 to 35 euro on a taxi (which only comes when called by the concierge). Do not rely on the #128 bus that stops on the edge of the Marriott compound; it is unpredictable, and if it does come for you, you'll have to ride it for over 45 minutes to the end of the line at Basilica San Paulo just to get to a subway station. However,if you insist on taking the 128 bus, you may want to switch over to the train station at Muratella or Magliana for a faster shot to the subway stop at Roma Termini. Like big-name hotel chains in other countries, the more you pay, the less you get. This hotel has no free breakfast and no free Internet - not even in the business center. For the 200 euro or more that this place currently charges per night, you'd have no trouble finding a more conveniently located hotel in central Rome that even throws in a free hot breakfast. This is a pretty hotel with nice rooms and a decadent spa, but it is probably not going to work well for the average traveler (who probably wants to go sightseeing in Rome and start each day a lot closer to those sights). I thought about what would make this hotel work better for me, and I came up with the following list: - Your primary reason for staying is a conference, lavishly funded by a big pharmaceutical company or similar outfit that provides you with at least two catered meals a day, coffee breaks, subsidized wifi and shuttle vouchers. - When sightseeing, you plan a daily commute into town by reserving a round trip on the hotel shuttle and don't mind this commute consuming nearly two hours a day of your time. - You are provided with access to the modest executive lounge on the basement level, which has a small assortment of beverages and snacks and a PC with free Internet. - You are not concerned with the price of the rooms because you're paying with Marriott Rewards points.

Be careful because there are issues you need to be aware of. Please keep in mind that I am a Marriott Platinum travel which entitled me to certain benefits which helped me with this stay here. The Good - This is a first rate hotel with beautiful, very comfortable rooms. The lobby is very nicely decorated and uniquely Italian. The Conscierge was extrmemly helpful and available M-S 8:00 - 17:00. We used the Executive Lounge (only available to Gold, Platinum and upgraded guests) which was stocked with snack food and drinks 24 hours. Breakfast was outstanding and as a Platinum memeber my entire family was \"comped\". There is a Sita bus stop outside the entrance gate which can take you to the Metroploitan train stop. From there you can go to the Airport (without swtiching trains) or into Rome by connecting to the subway. This worked for our family as we are adventurous but I caution you that it may not work for you. If you choose to do this and plan on staying 2 - 3 days I would recommend the \"Roma Pass\". Makes travel much cheaper, easier and gets you into 2 Museum sites fro free. The Bad - Food is very expensive. If we were not \"comped\" for breakfast it would have cost 27.50 Euro per person. The buffet was good but not that good. A simple hamburger was 18 Euros. Also, there are no restaurants around as this hotel is located in a business park so plan ahead for dinners and breakfast. Best advice is to eat in Rome. They do offer a shuttle however it costs 10 Euros per person for round trip. While much cheaper than a cab, this service is still pricey. We opted to take the bus (read above). The Ugly - This hotel is not centrally located in Rome. Shuttle ride is a half hour and doing the Sita bus/Metro Train/Subway connection thing we did takes about an hour. If you do this make sure you get the bus & train schedule from the conscierge.

We got to be there for the Earth Quake, which surprisingly woke us up at 3:30 am, thankfully Rome was far enough away from the center. The points were significantly lower than the Grand Flora which is closer to Rome's center, and we figured it was worth the hundreds of dollars we would save. We got a little nervous as our trip got closer and we read a lot of the negative reviews on here. Here are some key take-aways 1. The Hotel has started offering a new Airport Shuttle bus from FCO. The cost is 10 Euro per person for a one way fare. This was a great convenience, and sounds like a big improvement from some of the negative reviews from earlier dates (people complained about the high cost of taxis) 2. If you stay at this hotel and plan on site seeing, just give yourself time to get to Rome in the morning. The shuttle bus service to the center of Rome was great... and pretty convenient (took about 30 to 45 minutes during rush hour... 25 to 30 minutes during other times). We would recommend that you don't book any tours before 9:30 am (10 am on the safe side) and you will be fine. An 8 am shuttle will get you into Piazza Cavour by 8:45 the latest... but then walking from there to your destination can take some time. Rome can be a confusing city, so give your self time to just wander and enjoy the sites. 3. The shuttle bus service was very convenient... though at 10 euro / person round trip... it can add up over a few days of vacation. In early April we had no issues with shuttle availability... the shuttle was a large bus, very new and modern, and there were always plenty of seats for us to sprawl out. 4. Public Transportation is a cheaper alternative. We took it one day in both directions. Only 2 Euro's per person each way. Just take the Bus 128 to the end of the line (they call it St. Paulo, but it has a different stop name). Then pick up the Metro (about a 2 minute walk from the bus stop). It was pretty easy.... though a little intimidating at first... because it is hard to know when to get off the first time you do it. The St. Paulo stop has a beautiful church (St. Pauls)... which is definitely worth looking at (though by the end of our trip we were pretty tired of seeing churches =)). 5. We also took a taxi one morning... we had an early tour, and realized the shuttle wouldn't get us there on time. THe taxi during rush hour was a big hurt on the wallet... cost 43 Euro to get to the center. Considering our train ticket from Rome to Florence was less than that... . So definitely try to avoid the taxis. 6. The concierge & front desk were VERY helpful and patient. We had a ton of questions, and they were great to work with. 7. Don't plan on spending any money at food at the hotel, unless you want to pay a fortune. We had a burger and a sandwhich, with fries... and the total cost was 34 Euro. The burger and sandwhich were very good, but no hamburger should cost 18 euro's. The nice restaurant was too expensive to consider. 8. One knock on the hotel is that the Fitness center and in door pool are not complimentary to the common person.

We were in one of the new, modern rooms with a balcony and a huge flatscreen tv that had internet access built in for \u20ac10 extra. There is a complimentary shuttle every hour into the city center that drops you off near the Ottaviano Metro stop, but it only seats 16 people and is first-come, first-serve. If you don't push your way onto the shuttle (and people do push!) then a taxi ride is about \u20ac20-25 to a similar drop-off point.

Also, the last shuttle out of the city center is at 21:30, so if you're eating dinner at 20:00 or so, you're probably not getting on it. (And again, the shoving and lining up early to get on.)

First I would like to do a fair review both the positives and neg of the hotel. The positives are the hotel itself is beautiful! The rooms are very large for Europe. The bed was extremely comfortable. The spa and fitness center was great also. The negatives are first the hotel does not have a shuttle service from the airport to the hotel and beware the taxis do rip off the tourist. We read this here on a previous review and was surprised the cab fair was over 80.00 euro The hotel said yes they have heard of the cabs charging even over 100 euro ! The other big neg is that it is a 30-45 min one way shuttle ride into Rome which doesnt leave until 8am so if you want to get into the city early you have to take a cab. The shuttle is 10 euro/per person which isnt bad but you either end up staying in Rome all day or going twice if you want a break in the midday.

You're 30-60 minutes outside of Rome, and the shuttle bus costs 10 euro per person round trip. It leaves every two hours from both spots. Now for us that wasn't a problem - the bus didn't fill up either of the two days we were there, so we had no problem taking an early bus there and a late bus back. We went to Rome for Rome, not the hotel, so we didn't mind that. We accepted it because we used Marriott points to stay for free - couldn't beat the price. Also, getting to the hotel from the airport requires work. A cab is around 50 euro or so, which we didn't want to pay, so we took a train and then a bus. Cost only 10 euro for 2 people, which was great, but took an hour and it was a bit bizarre to see a pack of dogs sitting on the grass outside the fence of the hotel as we rolled our suitcases from the bus stop to the hotel doors.

The shuttle service is great but I suggest you book it for the length of your stay as soon as you get there. If you are not wealthy please make sure you have your meals in Rome because the restaurant in the hotel is extremely expensive and once there you can't walk anywhere else to grab a bite. It seems they are taking advantage of their location in the middle of nowhere by overcharging for the meals, a burger will run you 19e($24.) If you don't mind any of the above then I'm sure you are going to like this hotel since it has very nice clean rooms, with flat screen TVs, and other amenities.", "Date": "July 12, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "4", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "Moscow", "Title": "\u201cHuge Conference Hotel in the middle of nowhere\u201d", "Author": "ABroach", "ReviewID": "UR8103983", "Content": "The Marriott Park isa brand new (opened begining June 2007) hotel which claims to be the largest conference hotel in Europe. It is located halfway between the airport and the city, in an industrial estate dominated by a huge Toyota building. It had only opened 20 days before we arrived for a conference. My wife had never been to Rome and imagined romantic views of the city etc. Sadly the hotel is not \"in Rome\" at all and apart form views of the industrial estate, seems to offer vistas of the nearby motorway and some rather flat countryside. The hotel is basically a standard Marriott with good rooms, furnishings, high speed internet etc plus two enormous exhibition sheds attached on either side of the hotel building. The area covered is vast and most delegates must have covered miles by the end of the conference. On the plus side, the rooms were good and had nice touches like 2 bathrooms. The hotel runs a very efficient free shuttle system to the center which takes between 40 minutes and 1 hour depending on traffic. On the negative side, it is not an attractive location and you have no concept of being in Rome. The hotel was obviously having teething problems. When 400 delegates came to check out there were 2 people on reception but they eventually found more. The conference rooms were good but there were problems with distracting noises from staff working nearby. There is a large outdoor pool and terrace whcih seems like a wind trap and could really benefit by being sheltered by trees as there is nothing to look at. One other thing was that no taxi drivers at the airport had any idea where the hotel is and charged sums ranging upto 60 Euros for an 11km journey. Should be about 25. If you are going there for a conference, great (once they have ironed things out) but it is not a place for a romantic Roman weekend", "Date": "July 11, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "3", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "1", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "San Francisco", "Title": "\u201cIn the Middle of Nowhere - Not for the tourist!\u201d", "Author": "greenjohn1", "ReviewID": "UR8064576", "Content": "As the title says it is is in the middle of nowhere.

Later we learned it would have been 15 to 20 by taxi. Did i mention it was in the middle of no where. Nothing to see or do. No local shops to get a refreshment or a cup of morning coffee. Only one restaurant in hotel. 28 euros for buffet breakfast, which was run of the mill.

Laundry starting at 4 for a pair of socks. Did I mention it was in the middle of no where, so there are no other options. They have no help for touring Rome with tour/guide contacts.

It is clearly aimed at business travelers or someone with a rental car that does not want to drive into the city. We were very happy with our 2 night stay there. I think Jeagan99's review on May 15 2007 was right on the money regarding the hotel. As other reviewers have commented, there is literally nothing around this property, just a few office buildings and some housing. A free shuttle runs every 2 hours to and from the city. It takes 20-30 minutes but drops you off in Piazza Cavour, a fine location in Rome. The shuttle was extremely prompt and the buses were clean, air conditioned and comfortable. You have to book your time ahead so it may not be the right place for a family of 4 looking for a vacation hotel. As a couple that planned to spend their entire day in the city walking around, it was fine for us. If we had planned to use the hotel as a base and go back and forth, it would not have been a good choice. The property is very nice inside and by far the most comfortable room I stayed in at any of my hotel stays in Italy. The staff was extremely courteous and spoke excellent English. Overall, I felt very comfortable in my room. The rooms are spacious and our King bed was so comfortable we hated to get up in the morning. (other guests on the shuttle made the same comment). This hotel feels more like a better USA property with a spacious bathroom, a good shower with plenty of clean soft towels and a decent closet. It also had AC/heat that kept the room at the tempure we selected. A safe is provided in the room. The room and the hotel were spotless. The fact that it was a new building meant that it was more spacious and better appointed then some of the better downtown European hotels I have stayed at on this and other trips. The lobby area is huge with comfortable couches and a good size bar/restaurant area. A new pool was about to open in the next few days, it looked very nice. We did not eat at the hotel but we did notice that breakfast was pricey, even for a typical city hotel. The continental breakfast buffet was 15 Euros and the full breakfast buffet 27 Euros. At 1.4 euros to the dollar, a $38 breakfast buffet is pretty pricey. When we visited in June 2007 there was still not a single sign on the building, the staff claims this is being resolved but it was very odd. It is located very near large buildings for AlItalia and Toyota so those need to be your landmarks driving to it. One thing that I did see driving in the general area at 6AM on Sunday (headed to the airport) was the pack of dogs that another reviewer noted. They were not on the hotel's property nor are they the hotel's responsibility but I would never suggest someone plan to jog or walk in early morning or evening in this area. I'm a physically fit adult male and even inside a car I was very alarmed by the number of dogs (more than 20). I can't imagine running into them on foot, alone.

For business travel, the Rome Marriott Park is a good choice as long as your business does not take you into Rome and your boss is not price-sensitive. The hotel has reasonably fast wi-fi access in the lobby and wired connections in the room. The internet access is very expensive --$22 Euros a day. The rooms themselves are very nice. Marriott has really upgraded their linens and bedding over the last few years and this property totally benefited. On the downside, the hotel feels like it's not fully finished yet. Only one of the two restaurants was open. The menu was limited (5-6 entrees) and quite expensive ($70 US for an appetizer, entree, 1 drink and bread). Room Service's menu had alot of overlap with the dining room menu. The restaurant thing is important because you're a good 20 Euro taxi ride each way from Rome proper unless you can manage to catch the shuttle bus which runs every 2 hours and fills up very quickly. For pleasure travelers, this is really not the hotel to stay at in Rome. You're far from the city in an office park. It is not scenic and it's expensive to get back into Rome. This hotel is really geared towards business travelers. You'd be better off for less somewhere else. The rooms themselves are nice, but the location is horrible for sightseeing.", "Date": "June 1, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "chandler az", "Title": "\u201cIsolated Location\u201d", "Author": "dennytara", "ReviewID": "UR7729065", "Content": "New Hotel far from center of Rome.
