{"Reviews": [{"Content": "Never stay here For US$60 I would expect a decent hotel to have at least a lift. Sorry....no lift in this hotel. I was staying at the fourth level. you can imagine i have to drag my luggage up 4 levels up and down!Secondly, the TV is not working in the room. When i called the main desk to fix the problem, they told me they cant coz the hotel antenna is not functioning! No kidding at all.Thirdly, its too stuffy in the room, i had to open the window to let some fresh air in.Although the location is near Tian An Men sq, its really not worth the money staying in this lousy hotel.", "Date": "Nov 21, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR498428625", "Ratings": {"Service": "-1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "-1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "1", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "-1", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "Chinadream"}, {"Content": "\u9288\u67ab\u5142\u9289\u693c\u5137\u9287\u0445\u9017\u6979?#x201d;   showReview(19166423, 'full');", "Date": "Nov 14, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR204226982", "Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "-1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "3", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "lass="}], "HotelInfo": {"HotelURL": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g294212-d604483-r10964433-Ping_An_Fu_Hotel-Beijing.html", "HotelID": "604483", "Price": "$104"}}
