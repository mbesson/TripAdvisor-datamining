For the metro, Cavour station is closest, but Vittoriano, about 10 minutes' walk away and in a slightly less desirable area, is very convenient as you can get to the main sights without having to change at Termini.

Great location.\u201d", "Author": "countryhiker", "ReviewID": "UR120194195", "Content": "We arrived in Rome after 5 days in Sorrento,(where our hotel room had been very large and comfortable). I expected there'd be a bit of an adjustment for us, as I knew that the room in Rome was going to be smaller. However, I have to say we had no problem at all adjusting to the wonderful surroundings of the Colosseum Hotel! Although the lobby WAS very different from our other hotel, the staff at the desk was very polite and professional. After the elevator journey,(which barely held the bellman,my husband and our 2 suitcases), we were most pleasantly surprised by the lovely room we encountered! We'd reserved a \"double\" and upon entering, we stepped into a hallway with 2 bedrooms off of it on the left, and a bathroom on the right at the end. There were beautiful hardwood floors throughout. We had room 72, which I can highly recommend for it's lovely view both from the bathroom on the right side and a totally different view from the balcony off the two bedrooms on the left. We quickly set up our 'camp' by depostiing the luggage in the smaller bedroom with one twin bed and placed the laptop on the desk there. That allowed us to have more room in the other bedroom where we slept. The bed was very firm but as we'd discovered in Sorrento, that seems to be the case everywhere in Italy. Trust me.We had NO problem sleeping after walking for miles every day in Rome! As for the breakfast,(which was included in the room price), we were very happy with it. True, they do not serve the typical American breakfast with eggs, we usually had a very fresh roll with wonderful ham and cheese. There were also croissants, and an assortment of packaged 'toasties' and jams. Oh yes, and my favorite-Nutella. The coffee was adequate but I quickly discovered that you could get a nice cappichino if you asked one of the attentdants. There's no reason to start your day of sightseeing hungry, as you can definitly find plenty to eat. As for the proximity of the hotel to the sights, I timed our walk to the Colosseum, it took us exactly 8 minutes to get there. Once there, you are basically just steps away from the Roman Forum. Granted, other sights, like the Vatican and Spanish steps are further, they are still within walking distance for the experienced walker. That said, someone who has physical problems would want to take another form of transportation to see some of the more 'faraway' sights. . We estimated that we walked about 10-14 miles per day. Yes, our feet were aching but I actually lost 4 lbs in Rome, eating EVERYTHING I wanted! Thus the benefit of walking. The morning we were leaving, the employee at the desk, called a cab for us to go to the airport. It was starting to get late and he took it upon himself to arrange for another private car to take us at the same price the cab would've been. We so appreciated his concern and willingness to make sure we did not miss our flight. All in all, our stay at the Colissuem was perfect. If you're looking for a quiet, cozy hotel, with old world charm, that is close to the sights in Rome, stay at this wonderful hotel.

A taxi to the centre of Rome costs 6 euros - but make sure the metre is switched on! The Metro is within walking distance - but it is crowded, and BEWARE pickpockets. My husband who has travelled the world for fifty years without incident, lost all his euros in a ten minute journey on the Metro. We walked to the Colosseum and Forum, and the four younger members of the family walked from the hotel to the centre of Rome every day in under 25 minutes.

If you book a few months in advance you will get a great rate for such a central hotel. However, to mention a little about the location... It's only a 5-10 minute walk from the Termini station which is handy, but the local area isn't the most pleasant in Rome. To walk to the local church (S. Maria Maggiore - well worth a visit by the way) you have to walk down Via Paulina which seems to be the preferred place for all manner of man/beast to use the building walls as a toilet - which makes this street a bit off-putting. Walk the other direction however and you're literally a few minutes from the Colosseum. The hotel public areas are a little dated but the rooms are very fresh with new wooden floors. The beds are very comfortable and there is no noise from outside. The only issue I had with our room was the lack of drawers (there were none at all). Breakfasts were a little lacking and could be improved. There were pastries, 2 types of cereal and ham & cheese with bread (plus jams / spreads). Coffee was often only luke warm and tea was available if you asked for the hot water. There were 2 men on reception, 1 at any given time, and it was somewhat a Jekyll & Hyde scenario. The Italian man was friendly and genuinely helpful. The guy originally from England was blunt and unwelcoming to the point of being rude. His attitude towards guests could seriously be improved (starting by maybe smiling every now and then). Don't lose your room key because they will charge you EUR150 to replace it. We were only told this after 2 days after Mr Surly (above) admonished me for not handing in my key at reception when we went out for dinner. He also insisted that this charge was explained at check-in, but it certainly wasn't. Just bear this in mind... The rooftop terrace is very relaxing and provides fantastic views of the city. Nice to chill out up there after a day sight-seeing. Please note that the lift only goes to floor 7 and there is another flight of stairs to get to the roof-terrace - so not very accessible for anyone less mobile.

All cold with a bit of meat and horrid cheese, otherwise packet bisuits and the like, a couple of cereals and disgusting coffee - surprising given Italians pride themselves on the quality of their coffee - and sugary OJ from a machine.

The only problem that we had was with the air conditioning that there was some noise coming from it and we had to try to fix it, because it disturbed our sleep, but this should be just one incident and they fixed it.

Don't use the first Coloseum guide you find at the site - the further back you go the cheaper the guide - 8 euros as opposed to 15 euros! Don't bother with the Roma Pass - waste of money.

The shower is a bit small and awkward to get into, but that's normal. We were on the 4th floor. Our view was nothing to write about, but it was nice to open the windows wide.

Travel - from Fiumicino Airport take the Leonardo Express train (EUR14 one way). This is probably a lot quicker and cheaper than a taxi and takes 25 minutes.

A taxi is advisable if you are in a family group. Not sure about the bus services as I didn't use them however, the bus station is right next to the train station. Reception - large traditional style waiting area with an internet terminal. Keys are left with reception each time you leave the hotel. Staff speak english well. Porter - they have a porter who assists with baggage to your room. Not entirely sure why! Only 4 and 5 star hotels have them these days. Room - Clean and with good quality furniture. Remote controlled airconditioning. TV (only english channel being BBC World News). Quite a nice south facing balcony. No tea or coffee facilities. Internet - I think you have to pay to access the wireless network. However, I managed to tap into an unsecured network somewhere along the street! Breakfast - served from 7:30am. Choice of 2 cereals (cheap imitation Cornflakes or a crunchy museli), Doughnuts and pastries. Cheese, bread rolls, jams a few choices of cold meats. There is an automatic juice dispenser which I cant say was good at all. The coffee machine was fine. Everything was edible but it was far from being the best breakfast I've ever had at a hotel! Value - I booked as part of an Expedia package deal where the hotel was effectively free (the cost of the flight on its own exceeded the package deal). I would not wish to pay more than \u00a360-65 had I paid full rate. Shops - there is a SPAR supermarket fairly close on Via Nazionle which is good for picking up water and snacks. Washing - noticed a laudrette on the main road behind the hotel! Could be handy for backpackers. Bars - Finnegans Irish bar is 5 minutes walk away, with Sky Sports and BBC/ITV. EUR6 for a Guiness! Colosseum - about 10 minutes walk away. Get there early (before 9:30am) and you will not have to queue up. Ignore the touts outside the monument. Entrance and guided tour is EUR14.

The hop-on hop-off bus is well worth the ticket price and takes you to a number of locations including the Vatican. We used the yellow Rome Cristiana bus that has a stop very close to the hotel. Just turn left from the front door and walk up towards the big church you can see. Then at the end of the road turn right. After a few yards you'll see the bus stop by the side of the road, just before the tourist information booth. If you want to avoid the long queues at the Vatican, you can buy a tour ticket from the ORP office. It's on the left of the road just before you reach the Vatican itself. The Colosseum was no problem; we strolled down for about 8:45am and walked straight in with no queue. The evening walk through the city from Edenwalks is excellent, and gives a terrific insight into Rome's history. There are lots of restaurants around the hotel. We only tried a couple but didn't run across the service charge problem others have mentioned. I would definitely recommend La Mela D'Oro - a charming little place with friendly staff and lovely food at reasonable prices. Take a left from the hotel door, walk to the end of the road so you are facing the church, turn left and follow the road round to the left so you are on Via S M Maggiore. The restaurant is a few yards down on the left. Other reviewers have said that Romans are arrogant. I have to say that we found the exact opposite. They are warm and friendly people who will always take the time to help you out. Perhaps it's down to way you approach them. A friendly smile and a word or two in Italian (however mispronounced!) goes a long way. To sum up: a great little hotel, lovely people and one of the best cities in the world. If you are keen to immerse yourself in the history and culture of the place, Rome will not disappoint.", "Date": "March 31, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "manchester", "Title": "\u201cgreat location, good hotel\u201d", "Author": "ManchesterChester", "ReviewID": "UR50358889", "Content": "We have just returned from a weekend trip to Rome. The hotel was booked on a number of the reviews from Tripadvisor as well as the discounted rate for november. In all I have to say that it is great budjet hotel, with a great location for the weekend traveller. In fact we walked to most of the \"must see's\" except the vatican. I made contact with the hotel prior to our arrival to request a room with a balcony as it was my partners birthday during our stay. They did not dissapoint, and upon arrival we were given room 72 which is possibly the best room in the hotel with a balcony overlooking the south of rome, with the Santa Maria basillica to the left,and the Colosseum to the right (thank you Stefano, it was very kind). I have to balance this obvious aim to please mentality against those reviews highlighting stand offish staff, for I have to agree there are some. This generally relates to the reception staff, who do their job but do seem a little officious. Anyway do not let this put you off. I put it down to it's just the way they are. The breakfast is good quality, the hotel clean and tidy as are the rooms. The rooftop terrace is fantastic. The weather was still ok so we were able to enjoy a bottle of wine up there as the sun set. We got the leonardo express from Fumicino airport. They run every half our, non stop and would recommend. The hotel is a 10 minute walk down the Via Cavour but take a good map to find Via Sforza. There are a number of good eateries around the Via Palermo/Via del Boschetto quarter and they are reasonably priced. We went to the Piazza Novano one night. It cost 6 euros in a cab and was worth it. It is has a lovely atmosphere. There are numerous places to eat but be mindful that it can be pricey!! we should have looked around more as we were hit with a %15 service charge. The Vatican is an obvious must, be mindful that it has 2 entrences and if you get off the metro at Ottoviano you will be nearer St peters Sq and Basilica. The museums are nearer the Cipro stop. We got off too early and had a fair walk to the museum entrances. They are amazing though. You must go.

Hotel and its side street is very quiet indeed and you get a great nights sleep despite Rome being hectic. The roof terrace on the 8th floor is adorable and we spent every evening up there watching sun go down, or having drinks with fellow tourists we had met. Only ever a handful of people up there but we had 4 scorching days so used it frequently. Breakfast adequate but quite simple. The concierge guys were not rude as some people stated, just low key and respectful. They also had your key waiting as you walked through the door so great service in those small ways. Cosy, intimate hotel with a large bathroom. Enjoyed my stay and would recommend for a mid price break. If you want something more glamorous it is not the place for you. The only minor complaint is that we had 3 single beds in our room so seemed a waste of space for us but no biggie. 2 tips, avoid the American Cafe on the square near Piazza Maggiore, we were charge 52 euros for an omlette, tea and toast for 2 people!!!!!! On last day we ordered from the specials board without checking menu prices and apparently 8 euros for 2 pieces of toast is acceptable. However go to the Chicken restaurant on Via Cavore (across road from 2 chinese restaurants). Amazing, amazing food and atmosphere, we went twice it was so good.

As far as location, we are young and active and don't mind a walk...we could get to the Colosseum in about ten minutes, fifteen max. The closest metro stop, Cavour, was about five minutes walk, and takes you to Termini or to the Colosseum in one stop. We took a taxi back twice at night from the general area of Trevi Fountain when we'd missed the Metro closing, and it cost about 8 euro.

However it was clean and tidy and the blinds and air conditioning worked great! (We met people that had paid significantly more per night who said they did not have air conditioning and were not impressed with their hotel room!) The breakfast was great (continental only).

After reading the reviews on this and other websites, we were a little apprehensive of our choice of this hotel. However, upon arriving, we were delighted with the hotel, our room, and its proximity to ancient Rome. The front desk staff spoke enough English to be helpful. Our room was small (which is to be expected anywhere in Europe) but it was clean and had everything we needed. The rooftop terrace was a great added feature and we enjoyed a late-night glass of wine overlooking a panoramic view of Rome. Considering that the noise and insanity of Rome traffic is only 1 or 2 blocks away, we found the hotel to be very quiet and well situated. The continental breakfast was very nice, all the food was very tasty, the coffee hot and the 2 female servers were very pleasant (even though they couldn't speak English). My advice to anyone travelling to Italy is to learn a few words of Italian (hello, goodbye, please, thank you) and to remember that a smile goes a long way. If you smile and try to speak a little of their language, they'll meet you halfway and your experience will be a lot more enjoyable. We would definitely go back to this hotel and would recommend it to anyone looking for a quiet, comfortable place to stay in Rome.", "Date": "October 18, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "4.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Oslo", "Title": "\u201can affordable, great hotel\u201d", "Author": "jordb\u00e6r", "ReviewID": "UR5902021", "Content": "After having stayed a week at the hotel, we would highly recommend it to people who are looking for an affordable, good location stay in Rome.

Our taxi driver was rather disgruntled trying to reach the front entrance due to the hotel's location (really a back street). Our tour bus the next day could not come to us and we had to walk several blocks to meet the bus which would never have fit on the street in front of the hotel. Reception staff seemed nice enough although upon checkin, the first sign of trouble - the elevator wasn't working. With 2 large bags and 3 small ones, we lugged them to the 2nd floor. Our room was tiny and with a view of walls!!! We had 3 single beds cramed into a small room. After arriving, we decided to rest a few hours from our overseas flight. After resting, we discovered the power was out. Their Italian explanation seemed to blame the city but upon observation, it appeared to be their breaker panels. Now with no AC, no TV, no power for charging electronic batteries, we decided to leave and sightsee. We hoped they would have the problem fixed upon our return. Upon our return, the 2nd floor halls were totally dark - not a good sign. When we commented, they came up and hit some breakers and we had hall lights. As usual they apologized. Now we were really apprehensive about room power. It was working. The next morning we rose early for our breakfast and bus tour. My wife had taken her shower the night before. When I turned on the shower, guess what? Absolutely no hot water, not even warm water. Walking down the stairs again, we ate their continental breakfast which was fairly good. We drug our packed bags down to their bag storage room (elevator still broken) and left for our tour. Upon our return, we checked out, mentioning to the receptionist about no power, cold shower water and tiny bathroom. They apologized and gave us a 20% discount on the bill. I guess this soothed us somewhat although after flown for 12 hours, the first thing you want is a warm shower. Hotel is overrated (3 stars) and we would never stay there again! One night was bad enough and not really the easiest place to find when walking.

The Hotel Colosseum is generally a really nice hotel, with very friendly staff. The hotel is located centrally, in an ideal place for visiting all of the tourist attractions.

The only problem we did have was with some unexplicable noise in the early hours of the morning. The first morning it started at 7.00am, and came from the room directly above us. It was either very noisey quests, or cleaners, because the following morning it started at 5.30am! It literally sounded like furniture been moved and somebody walking around in heels! I think this was just bad luck on our part, but it even woke us up when we were wearing earplugs! We didn't complain about this, as the first morning we thought it was noisey guests and we would be leaving early the following morning anyhow, to get our flight back home...5.30am was definately too early though for a wake up call! We would have definately asked to have changed rooms if we had stayed longer. The continental breakfast was good, with a choice of two cereals, croisants or bread, fruit juice, coffee, tea.
