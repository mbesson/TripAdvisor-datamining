The staff at the hotel was extremely friendly, and on various occasions the owners son and his friends did their best to help me with as much as they could, from my luggage, to coffee, to finding a good restaurant. This is what made the hotel great, because it is a small hotel which makes it more personal since they know everyone who is staying there at the moment. It was a great deal for the price we paid as other hotels seemed to be very expensive and didn't appear to be any different considering this hotel is close to many of the main attractions of Istanbul. The only negative parts of our stay was the noise of the lobby since we were on the 1st floor, you could hear almost every conversation that was going on which made it hard to sleep at first but was not a serious problem. Also, there were not many choices for breakfast but it was nice to sit outside in the morning for coffee. Overall, we had a great time here.", "Date": "October 24, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "M\u00c3\u00bcnchen", "Title": "\u201cA place from where you can enjoy Istanbul\u201d", "Author": "RobertWolfgang", "ReviewID": "UR119253281", "Content": "Situated in the midst of the historical city, with few minutes walking not only to major monuments but also to the tramway.
