We wanted the room with a free standing bath tub, the one they are advertising for at their homepage. It was rented out and we got a nice and spacious groundfloor room with a spacious bathroom which was OK; the frontdesk offered us to change for the last night to the latter. We should have been staying in the first room. Coming home in the evening to the new room for the last night it was not very warm, we thought of a probable heating down-shift overnight, heating systems are sometimes programmed for. We went to bed but woke up the morning seeing our breath steam into the cold. The central heating had fallen out over the chilli Berlin winter night. Phoning the frontdesk they said that there has been a problem that could not immediately fixed so we went unwashed for the check-out. The lady at the desk did apology but not propose any discount for that uncomfortable room the last night. Starring astonished at her she asked:\"what do you expect?\" I had to argue for being offered finally a 10% discount on the rate for that night. An unusable room. A breakfast offered in exchange would already have helped to calm our spirits. Nothing of that. Not very professional and traveler friendly. The day started badly and we had difficulties to catch for another mood.", "Date": "March 18, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cGreat palce to stay and enjoy a welcoming hotel\u201d", "Author": "Aquinn1212", "ReviewID": "UR119060735", "Content": "We stayed at this quaint, well appointed and atmospheric hotel.

Makes sure to ask for a room with a courtyard (prepare to be surprised at the lack of furniture outside though). What I loved most about our stay here: the area (Kreutzberg is so funky), the hotel (see above), the front desk (so disinterested), the mysterious check-in (located in the Cafe), the layout of the hotel (typically Berlin-style), Nespresso (no idea it was so good - but with just two 'bullets' per day from the hotel?). Still, one euro each per bullet is much cheaper than the crap take-away coffee around the neighbourhood).

It was very easy to find and, on arrival, was made to feel very welcome by the staff. As mentioned previously, there isn't a lift in the hotel, but if I had needed it, someone would have happily carried my case to the room for me. The hotel also will store you bag on your last day (if you want to go sightseeing). You just need to leave the bag packed in the room and they will take it to reception for you. The rooms were of a very good size (I'm used to cramped accommodations in major citites). The only complaint I had of the room itself was that the overhead shower, on occasion, would go very hot. The hand shower (also in the shower cubicle) was fine though. The room didn't have air conditioning, but did have a ceiling fan and plenty of windows for ventiliation. It also had heaters, if needed. The room also had a mini bar, safe, iron, TV and free wifi. For an extra charge you can also have a DVD player. In short, it has everything you need. As the hotel was \"off\" the road (in a courtyard), it was very quiet other than the coming and going of guests. However, my main, and possibly only real critcism, was that the corridors in the hotel had big metal doors at the end (to the adjoining stairwell). At times, when they closed, the noise of the doors was pretty loud. Also, housekeeping started at 8am and was fairly noisy for a while. If you're a light sleeper and fancy a lie in, you might want to bear that in mind. I didn't opt for the breakfast. I did eat there one morning, and although the hot chocolate was divine, I found the croissant very dry. The cakes looked good though. All that said, the location (a few mins to Mehringdamm U-Station) was great. If, like me, you arrive at Tegel airport, getting to the hotel is easy. Catch the X9 bus from the airport to Jakob-Kaiser-Platz U-station. Then take the U7 underground line to Mehringdamm (in the direction of Rudow). Over all.. compared to some of the other hotels I viewed, and the associated prices, I was very comfortable. Just a shame about the 8am noise, that's all. Incidentally though.. the housekeeping was great. Very clean, fresh towels every day. I hope you enjoy your stay and Berlin - a great place!", "Date": "September 10, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Helsinki, Finland", "Title": "\u201cNice and different hotel\u201d", "Author": "hoharrison", "ReviewID": "UR66488676", "Content": "Very clean and nice rooms in old factory.

The Sarotti is an excellent choice with fantastic rooms, exposed brickwork, free standing bath, plasma TV, really clean, great value mini-bar, and everything else that you would want from a hotel. And it costs less than 100 euros per night. Breakfast and drinking is done in the beautiful cafe which is a popular local haunt, so the place doesn't actually feel like a hotel, but more like somewhere with great rooms off a courtyard out the back of a neighbourhood cafe.
