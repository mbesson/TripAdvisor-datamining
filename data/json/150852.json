We just returned from our Honeymoon at the RIU Melao in Punta Cana. We purchased a RIU Riulette from our travel agent as we had never been anywhere south before and were open to anything so it was a good deal for us. We ended up getting RIU Taino at the airport but as Taino and Melao are now run out of the same desk our room was on Melao. I think we ended up in the best resort as far as we were concerned. The staff at our resort were exceptional! Right away when they found out we were Honeymooners - we were upgraded to a bigger room -King bed - lots of towel animals and balloons. The first member of the staff we met was Genndy. He is the main bartender/ steward. He sent us champagne to our room and was always ready to have a laugh and grab us our drinks etc. He spoke English fairly well, so that was helpful as he could translate the Spanish for us. Our waiter we had everyday was Jos\u8305. Although his English was limited - he tried always to be so friendly and outgoing. Great person!!The manager Roberto was awesome -he arranged for two special dinners for us at the Palace Macao - one for my husbands birthday! Not to mention countless other little things. The beaches have soft, white sand, the water is the beautiful, clear Caribbean water and our resort was awesome.We went on a great excursion called Bavarro Runners - so great to see the actual country and how people live - awesome!! Would recommend highly!! Jacky was the guide -so fun. Can't say enough good things about this place. I work in the Hotel industry and can be very picky about accommodations - so if I loved - I am sure it you will too!!! This is great spot for a quiet time - not really a party place. The best vacation I have ever had!!!", "Date": "Oct 19, 2006", "ReviewID": "UR607473180", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "5", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "OctoberBride13"}, {"Content": "Super le melao               More photos", "Date": "Aug 22, 2006", "ReviewID": "UR572683805", "Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Business service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "Alexandre_06"}, {"Content": "Average resort               More photos", "Date": "Jun 14, 2006", "ReviewID": "UR831239935", "Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "3", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "ocean79"}, {"Content": "unable to sleep The Dominican Republic has an amazing and diverse cultural heritage. It is independently thriving with its agricultural and industiral developments. I am unable to convince myself to return however, mostly due to my stay at this hotel in 2003. My son, who was 3 at the time, tripped over a very large rat one evening by the pool after participating in a children's program. The rat was large-probably around 5-8 pounds. Luckily my husband scooped him up as the rat was circling around with a broken leg and he avoided being bitten. There were rats playing around the pool area during the day causing guests to scream occasionally and raise their feet up to their chairs. There were large cockroaches in our room on the ground floor. The pillows smelled of mildew. After the rat episode on the third evening we requested to be moved to a new room on an upper floor. In the second room we did not see any cockroaches-this may have been due to sleeping with all the lights on due to my fear of the rats. The pillows in this room also smelled like mildew. In one restaurant for an evening meal my husband had to use the restroom. There were roaches crawling out of cracks in the walls. The food tasted great and we did not get sick. I just can't help but imagine the roaches and rats walking over the kitchen areas since they were out in public areas. I could not sleep and anticipated the end of our trip. We decided to get a Taxi and go into a small town to shop. A prostitute approached my husband while in a cafe with myself and our 3 year old. A man from a shop attempted to carry off my child in an attempt to get us to follow him to his store (this was not encouraging to get us to buy something). Finally we were riding the shuttle back to the airport and are pulled over by men with machine guns. Apparently we were attempting to return to the airport when government members were arriving for the latin american summit. We have stayed at other Riu properties in Latin America, and the Melao was an entirely different experience. I do realize that the climate is very nice for roaches and rats, but the hotel needs desperately to implement some form of pest control as well as dehumidification system in the rooms. I did not feel safe (especially for my child) for these health reasons as well as the political instability. My husband is a police officer and speaks Spanish fluently and usually we are comfortable traveling about and had looked forward to a trip to the Dominican Republic for quite some time. It is the most unforgetable trip we have ever been on.", "Date": "Feb 26, 2005", "ReviewID": "UR490551207", "Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "1", "Value": "1", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member"}, {"Content": "Very nice vacation This hotel was extremely nice.

Most of the guests were more than 30 years old (couples) or children. Guests were mainly from France, Germany, Italy, Spain, USA and Canada.

Clean rooms, great service, good food. Rooms are stocked with a free mini-bar and fridge with soft drinks and beer.Beaches were very nice. Strong breezes kept the heat down. There are palm trees that ring the beach line, letting you sit in the sun or under the shade trees - your choice. A barrier reef forms a break water, creating a pool effect in many parts of the beach. Decent snorkeling opportunity. Boat operators were very conscientious about respecting swimming zones, too. The on-site dive operator uses outboard motor driven open boats that they run right up on the beach to pick you up. Diving was good for beginner - ok for medium skill level, but not challenging (except climbing back into the boat - no platforms). Surf can be fairly heavy here, except in August (seas were 3 ft or less while we there)! Clientele is heavily European (i.e., fair number of topless women - but the hotels STRONGLY discourage full nudity, especially at the pools!) English was widely spoken, but probably 3rd or 4th on the list (Spanish, Dutch, German, Engilish).There is shopping at the RIU complex, an open market about a mile down the beach (nice walk), and in town (about 10 minute taxi ride).This was a good place to unwind - no problem recommending it!", "Date": "Mar 14, 2003", "ReviewID": "UR429728274", "Ratings": {"Service": "-1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "-1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "5", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "-1", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member"}, {"Content": "Enjoyed the Rui Meloa My husband and I just returned from spending 15 days at the Riu Melao in Punta Cana. This was our third consecutive year in Punta Cana, but the first time at the Riu Melao (last year we stayed at the Riu Bambu). The Melao is the smallest of the 5 Riu Hotels in the complex there. It is also the oldest. The swimming pool is small, but okay. The rooms are small, but also okay with twin beds pushed together. If you like to use a washcloth, take your own. They don't supply them. Also the sheets are not fitted so they have a tendency to rumple up around you during the night while you sleep - especially if you are a large person. I brought special sheet garters that I attached to the sheets and slipped around the corners of the mattress- they worked quite well. The food can be repetitious, but it is good. The Melao is very close to the beach so that is nice. The trees and plants around the Melao are quite spectacular. You feel like you're in the jungle. The director, Gustavo and sub-director, Ernesto are very, very nice as well as accomodating. If you have a problem and tell them, they see that it is taken care of immedately. We needed extra pillows, our bathroom lights burned out, and the lock on our sliding glass doorwall out to our terrace needed to be repaired. All of this was done within a few hours after we reported our needs. The staff is extremely friendly even though we often times had a hard time understanding each other. Most staff speak Spanish with a smattering of English thrown in. We'll return to the Riu Hotel complex next year, but probably stay at the Riu Bambu or Riu Taino. These hotels are newer, have bigger pools with swimup bars, have better and more of a variety of food, and have better nighttime entertainment and daytime activities.....they are much more glamorous than the Melao.

The grounds were immaculate, service was speedy and friendly, drinks were yummy (and strong) and the food was better than expected. Our only complaint, and this is coming from spoiled Americans, is that the air conditioning in the rooms was less than adequate. I know we went south for warmth, but there was never any relief from the heat. The restaurants are not air conditioned, so you are always hot and sticky. Maybe the 5 star Riu Resorts had better HVAC. We loved that we could use all 5 of the Riu Resorts. We did eat at the ala carte restaurants twice and thought they were pretty good. My husband did get sick towards the end of our trip probably due to the water. Do NOT even brush you teeth with the tap water.
