This hotel is dirty. Our shower had mold and there was hair in the corners of the bathroom that housekeeping could never seem to get up. Housekeeping is severely lacking at this hotel. There was a bed pillow on the floor when I left the room for it to be cleaned. When my husband and I came back to the room after it had been \"cleaned\", the pillow was still there - on the floor. Housekeeping would not change out our coffee cups. The same dirty coffee cup was there until we checked out. They also did not want to change the sheets on the bed. Finally, I decided to take the sheets off of the bed, along with the comforter and put them in a pile on the floor. Housekeeping got the hint and changed our sheets. In regards to the mold on the shower, I get fed up with that too and I finally just took a towel and started cleaning some of the mold off. Pretty gross!!!The corridors and hallways needed vacuuming as well. My husband arrived a couple of days before I did, and the room he was originally checked into was dirtier than the second room. He could not take it. He moved to the second room and was charged a 25.00 additonal rate per night because the second room had a view of the ocean. The hotel never took into consideration that the reason my husband had to move was because of the filthiness of the room. Also, in the first room my husband saw the bug called the silverfish. There were a couple of them crawling around on the floor. Needless to say, please don't stay at this hotel.....it was utterly filthy!! We would have moved, but it was the chosen conference hotel and we had already paid. Other attendees were complaining about the conditions of their rooms as well.

We arrived a day early to enjoy San Juan before our cruise departed on Sunday night. I booked 1 night at the Conrad based on it's location, looks, price and previous reviews. We have a family of 4 so 2 beds in the main tower with city views. We could see the port and the bay from our balcony. I didn't feel the need to pay extra for an ocean view for 1 night and we were not going to be in our room much anyway, so why bother? The room was comfortable and nice modern decor. Comfy beds, cool bathroom with a fully glass enclosed shower, a balcony and no bedbugs (yes I checked). I saw 2 pools, both were nice, we went to the small (very small) beach and let the youngest play in the sand, it was nice and calm and relaxing. Beach chairs are free with hotel bracelet from the towel stand. We were starving so played it safe and easy at Dennys for our first meal, it's in the hotel (other side) so with kids, we knew it was safe. Starbucks (a must for me) was in the hotel, so that was our #1 stop!!! Saturday night we did the bioluminescent bay tour in Fajardo. I booked it 4 weeks ago on line and would highly recommend doing that...you can't wait till you are there, they sell out fast. It's far, about 1.5 hour drive, so pay extra for the transportation they offer instead of a taxi. I booked with Kayaking Puerto Rico (.com) and had a great experience and we all loved it, kayaking in moonlight in dark mangroves to see the water slowly start to glow as you glide through the water is a very memorable experience! Only 5 in the world, and 3 are in Puerto Rico...this should not be missed! On sunday morning we checked out and had the hotel hold our bags while we walked down Ashford till we found a Puerto Rican restaurant that we could try. We found a good one about a good mile or so down on the opposite side of the road, and of course I can't recall the name of it (sorry) But I tried the Mofongo with white fish and it was so delicious!!! A safe first taste of a Puerto Rican dish. Took a taxi from the hotel to the port in old town and checked in at the ship and dropped off our bags then left the ship to tour old town and El Morro for a few hours. Walked to El Morro...it's a distance, but doable...just have water or stop and buy some icy drinks along the way! So tasty!! ABSOLUTELY BEAUTIFUL old city! We were back to the ship by 5 p.m. got our luggage and explored the ship, ate, saw the ship leave and we were off to a fabulous trip. I would recommend this hotel for a stay in San Juan...next time I think I will try a hotel in old town for the experience for one night and then travel to the Caribbean side of the island and stay at a resort for a few more days...mix it up. I hear the rainforest is really cool...but no time to see on this trip, next time for sure!!!", "Date": "April 11, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Trinidad", "Title": "\u201cGood for the business traveller\u201d", "Author": "Kavita D", "ReviewID": "UR127703643", "Content": "This hotel is nicelt situated between the airport and San Juan.

I typically stay at Hilton properties and I am a HIlton Honors member. The property appears dated and not very well maintained. The shower is just gross. For nearly $400/night including the 16% resort fees, I expect a shower that appears clean and without visible mildew/mold. Neither television worked properly and we had to put a call into maintenance. I booked a city view junior family suite. I guess I have a different vision of what a city view should be. It should not be a view of the ocean tower of the same property. I am staying on the third floor and the road below is very noisy. If you think that you might want to enjoy the beach, forget it. It really is not a beach. It is a small strip of sand next to the main drag and it certainly is not private in any way. Stopped at Aqua for lunch at around 2:30pm. Not many patrons but there sure were plenty of tables--all of them dirty. Waited several minutes for someone to remove dirty plates and utensils. Waited another 20 minutes for someone to actually clean the table. Went for two drinks and some appetizers, finally left nearly 1.5 hours later, not because we took our time but because the service was terribly slow. Perhaps they were short staffed due to Good Friday. Perhaps the service is just poor. I also don't appreciate the resort fee add-on when we did not use any of the amenities.

The staff isn't the friendliest. We were told that we would be called when our room was ready and we were not, we had to wander back and wait on the line all over again. The room was nice- I would DEFINITELY request the main building with an ocean view. We were on the 8th floor and hear no noise, but the view of the street/roof is ugly. The shower was very relaxing and the beds very comfortable. Our room was cleaned daily. The pools are the best part- it is very pretty outside, but if you are looking for a beach, there really isn't one. It is right by the road/ bridge and the sand is very orange and not smooth. The larger pool with the slide has a younger atmosphere with very loud party music. Luckily you can't hear the music from the back pool if you want more of a relaxing reading environment. The hotel food was not good, and the drinks were not mixed- they hand you a pina colada and all the rum is at the top- how hard is it to mix it for a second? If you go I would definitely walk left out of the building for food or go to Starbucks for breakfast. There is no night life at the hotel, I would recommend going into Old San Juan.

Check in was a breeze and the room was quite nice and clean. I recommend an ocean view because the street view is less than spectacular. This was our third time staying at this hotel. We reserved through priceline each time. The Mezzanine level has an ice cream store which was reasonably priced and the kids really enjoyed. There is a Starbuck's downstairs and Chili's is within an easy walking distance. There is a small beach at which you can swim or snorkel on the property. The pool is really fun. There was a very large one with a waterslide that looked like El Moro and then another pool. There was also a large hot tub. None of the pools was crowded and we could always find a lounge chair when we went swimming. The kids had a great time. You can check out towels for free until 6pm. After 6pm, you are on your own. The beds were incredibly comfortable and they come with four pillows each. The sheets were a high thread count and were clean. My problem was that my room was never cleaned. I found out that because my room was done through priceline's (name your own price), they made back to back reservations instead of one continuous, so the hotel had actually put us in another room on their computers. So, when our room still wasn't clean by 3 pm it was because housekeeping's computers showed our room as unoccupied. Understandable mistake. So, when I talked to housekeeping at 3pm, I expected our room to receive some attention. By 4:30, no one had come. I went down to the front desk and talked with them. They called housekeeping. 5:30, no cleaning. Ok, we are going to dinner. I went by the desk again and told them we were going to dinner and could they clean the room. Of course. We got back at 8pm and the room still hadn't been cleaned. I called the desk and talked to them again and asked at least if they could bring up towels. They said of course and that a manager would call me. No manager called and I had to call again for the towels. This was SO unacceptable for a resort hotel, especially a Hilton. The bathrooms in the swimming area had 3 out of 4 locks broken off and the door was filthy with dust. It was not what I expect for a Hilton. If I priceline \"name your own price\" for a resort, I will be sad if Conrad Condado is picked again for us.

This was lacking! However, when brought it to the manager\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s attention (Jean) he was understandable and made sure our stay was enjoyable.

The staff is generally polite, but untrained with regard to superior service. If a resort fee is collected, I expect superior service, not just a view. We arrived early to the hotel and were told that no rooms were available to check in to and that we would be telephoned as soon as the room was ready. So, we tried to use the \"locker room\" to change into beach wear, but it was being cleaned. A snarky employee suggested we use the shower area (which was at the public beach and is out in the open). No other option was made available other than the bathroom. They also didn't tell us about the towels we could borrow for the beach, nor that there was a pool/hot tub on both sides of the street/buildings. Or that you could walk across the street to access the other building and that you did not have to wait for the (slow) elevators to use the connector. Four hours later we checked back to find that no room was ready and that we were told we would definitely have a room by 4PM. At 415pm, we approached the desk again and the man said, I called people, I don't know if I called you. He gave us a room on the fourth floor and a lagoon view. While I also understand that there are security procedures in place, they asked for ID ever single time we approached the desk even before the keys were disbursed. I second credit card did not suffice, so a trip the to the car was necessary on each occasion. (we eventually learned to carry it 24/7) The room was very small. Nicely furnished but small and the view was mostly of the roof of the building. I called and requested a different room. We were accommodated and were told that this was a nicer room. (Why not give us that room in the first place?) The 8th floor room was much bigger and nicer. The maid service was great. We found our rooms adequately clean and restocked each day upon returning. The food at the cafe (we had burgers) was very good. Reasonably priced for a \"resort\" Aside from the many missed opportunities to shine for guest services, my biggest complaint was the resort fee AND a parking fee for each day totaling over 30 dollars additional per day. C'mon folks stop the fee junk. Rate your room accordingly. Oh and my Facebook account was hacked while I was there despite the desk assuring me that the connection was safe. Not cool.

I still didn't want to give up and went back the next day to the Front desk to see if an ocean view room was possible. To our surprise, we were told that an ocean view room was already reserved for us and we would get it that day (not sure why the manager who checked us in the first day didn't tell us that). Either way - we were super grateful and excited. The ocean view is simply amazing. Hearing those waves when waking up in the morning is something so serene.

At the beginning, we were enjoying ourselves, until one of the bartenders started behaving overly sexually towards me \u00e2\u20ac\u201c looking and making comments about my breasts and touching my arm. At the time, I decided to disregard this in order to have a good time with my partner. Sometime later, we decided to swim in the pool, and come back to have a drink at the bar, which is connected to the pool. We were behaving generally like everyone around us \u00e2\u20ac\u201c not doing or wearing anything inappropriate. At some point, it appears that the male staff was able to infer that we, as two women, were a couple, and that is when we were treated very poorly. Another bartender approached us and asked us to leave the area, without much explanation. He implied that we were being asked to leave because we are gay. Once again, we did not touch inappropriately or even kiss. He said that another guest made a complaint, but there was no evidence or witness to step forward. At that point, we were very offended and walked to the front desk to inquire more about the reason why we were being asked to leave the bar, since no clear explanation was given. The concierge took a very long time to get one of the manager. The manager who came up to talk to us was Victor Diaz, Front Office Manager. He was being very disrespectful, also not offering a clear explanation or presenting any evidence that backed up our claim. Next, it seems like he was searching for any explanation to get rid of us, only saying that someone said that one of our body parts was exposed, which was completely untrue, since the swimwear we were wearing covered up everything very well. Since the manager was being very disrespectful, my partner wanted to get a clearer explanation and touched his arm to hear him better. At that point, he acted as if we violated some kind of hotel rule and called a security manager, saying that we would also need to vacate the premises. The security manager\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s name is Jesus Mesa, Assistant Security Director. At that time, they also called the police and said we needed to get our things and leave. Once the police arrived, the officers did not seem to treat this as an event of any importance and did not give us much of an explanation either. The main thing to note is that the police officers acted as if we really were nowhere near as culpable as the managers were making it out to be. At that point, we were offered no refund for the last night that we already paid, and we were charged extra for the service at the bar. We were not given any consideration about leaving the hotel and any accommodations we might need to make, since we did not know the area well and are two young women who appeared as easy targets to take advantage of. Overall, it is outrageous that we would be targeted and treated so poorly by hotel staff that is located in a U.S. territory. We were given very little explanation and were obviously singled out as two female lesbians. The main point is that we were not acting inappropriately, we were not told to leave because we were intoxicated or behaved in any way against the rules presented to us at the time we were at the bar. Also, there is no evidence present of any witnesses making complaints against us. Overall, this is an offensive human rights violation \u00e2\u20ac\u201c we are two paying customers with highly respected jobs in Washington, DC, USA. We are a U.S. citizen and a permanent resident, and to be treated this poorly in a U.S. territory at a highly rated hotel is an outrage. Ultimately, we will be pursuing legal action against Conrad San Juan Condado Plaza, Victor Diaz and Jesus Mesa. This is not simply an example of extremely poor customer service of which further customers should be warned, but an example of injustice and a human rights violation.", "Date": "March 6, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Manchester, New Hampshire", "Title": "\u201cGreat hotel, staff, location...\u201d", "Author": "Selena R", "ReviewID": "UR125615421", "Content": "Just spent 5 night here for a girls get away.

We took a cab into Old San Juan and had a great meal and experience at Punta De Vista. It's locate near the pirate ship. It's a locals spot.

The positives: Pools are very nice, as is the shady play and lounging area facing the ocean The hotel staff is cheerful, pleasant, and go out of their way to be helpful at every juncture The rooms were nice, clean, reasonably spacious, and our ocean view room in the original hotel building had a lovely view You can get coffee, fruit, and little tidbits at breakfast time in the lobby. Having the Starbucks attached to the hotel is insanely helpful The negatives During this very busy time of year, the main pool at the original hotel was constantly mobbed The pool in the annex has a southwestern exposure, so there was no relief from the sun and heat there at all. It was like a science fiction novel! I really didn't like being blasted with House music from the bar at the pool. Not only was it extremely loud, even 50 feet from the bar, but there were a bunch of lyrics in the music that were not suitable for my 6-year old. Later in the day, they changed to salsa and merengue, but it was still amazingly loud. Damn. The hotel was at times overrun with short-stay cruise ship passengers. One of them gave us all a Norovirus. We were extremely ill, and needed to see the hotel doctor multiple times. On the other hand, both doctors were pleasant, helpful, had excellent english, and seemed very sharp indeed. And the hotel staff was great about bringing us broth and sliced ginger and cleaning up our vomit and such (sorry.) So, I have really mixed feelings.

We arrived just after midnight on a Thursday for a long weekend. We booked the first night with Hilton points, the next two nights with AMEX points and the last two nights with a credit card. I called in advance to make sure they would be able to keep us in one room, and again after it was all booked. They assured me both times that it wouldn't be a problem. When we arrived, the person at the front desk said that she couldn't assure us that we would be in the same room, despite the fact that we booked all five nights in the same room type and had received assurances that they had made notes and that it wouldn't be a problem. We agreed to follow up with a manager the next morning and headed off to our room in a bad mood. When we got to the room, there was dried urine and a public hair on the toilet (the toilet seat was loose and my wife sat down on it before it slid sideways to reveal this fact). We were tired and waited to address it until the morning on our way out the door to a zipline adventure (Campo Rico - awesome). The person at the front desk was dumbfounded that it was an issue whether we would be allowed to stay in the same room for all five nights and promised to have housekeeping clean the room immediately. We got back at 2:00 pm and the room still hadn't been cleaned. We stopped someone in the hall who again promised that he would have someone clean the room and toilet right away. We then left for a couple of hours and came back at 4:00 pm to find that the room still hadn't been cleaned. We changed and stopped again at the front desk to complain, and were again told that it would be handled right away. As with each other person, I specifically mentioned that there was dried urine and a pubic hair, thinking that this would cause immediate action. We then left to spend the evening in Old San Juan and came back around 11:00 pm. When we walked through the door, my wife was thrilled that they had finally cleaned the room. However, I walked over and raised the toilet seat just to confirm that they had cleaned the toilet. No such luck, as it still had dried urine and a pubic hair. I immediately went down stairs and asked for a manager. I was very upset, but he seemed responsive and immediately sent someone to clean the toilet. He asked what he could do for me, and I told him that I wasn't looking for any comps and just wanted the bathroom to be cleaned. While we were waiting for housekeeping, I called downstairs to inquire about the rates for long distance calls (Verizon Wireless had no cellular plan for Puerto Rico) and they put the same manager on the phone. He told me that they would comp the phone calls and that despite my statement that I wasn't looking for any comps, my wife and I could use the hotel services free of charge. I felt much better, although we did not take him up on his offer to use the hotel services. However, when I went to check out two days later, the phone call was on my bill. Now, I didn't ask for the free phone call and didn't really mind paying for it, but was infuriated that they had offered up the free phone call and had still charged me. More incredibly, my wife reminded me that we couldn't get through and had left a message. Her dad had called back a few minutes later and we had talked for about 15 minutes. The same thing happened the next day. So, they were actually charging us for incoming calls. Now, none of this was meaningful financially. However, the complete lack of customer appreciation was infuriating and partly runied my long weekend with my wife away from the kids. My wife ultimately stayed for the last two days for work and managed to track down the manager, who removed the phone charges and a few other charges as well. Nevertheless, I will never get back the time that I spent stressing over the horrendous service in that hotel (We also went to the well reviewed on-site restaurant - \"Pikayo\" - and it was equally terrible). I wouldn't wish this place on my worst enemy and will be taking the time to let the Hilton know my feelings as well. San Juan was fabulous, but this hotel was terrible.

I stayed in an ocean view on the 7th floor. Check-in went smoothly (around 7pm) without a wait. My first room was on the 3rd floor and was very very noisy due to a wedding in the lobby area. I changed rooms the next night up to the 7th floor without a problem. The rooms were modern and clean. There is a safe, mini-fridge, coffee maker in each room. Omel/Otel? at the front desk is very great, friendly and eager to assist. I dined at the Caribe cafe for breakfast and service is quick and the coffee is good (better than Dennys). The Denny's located in the hotel opened 1 week prior to my arrival so I dined here quite a bit (and for a lot cheaper) too! The Denny's is REALLY nice and new with a full-bar (cheaper drinks without the view). The servers are all BRAND new and very uneasy--it's pretty obvious. I cut them some slack because the place just opened a week prior. The pool bar (bartender David) is great and very friendly but drinks are a littly pricy. I loved the swim up bar option too. The lobby bar (bartender Chris) is nice 'swanky' vibe and has happy hour in the afternoons! Eight Noodle Bar has pretty good food. The service is not friendly...but the sushi is pretty good. The gym is very nice and has everything you could want including a sauna and jacuzzi! Free weights, dumb bells, kettle bells, bozu balls, medicine balls, treadmills, etc etc Pools are nice--salt water pool, 2 other pools, 2 jacuzzis. Servers also walk around taking orders. The one issue was the towels. You cannot get a towel after 6pm at the pool and you must return them to the towel attendant by 6 or you will be charged 25.00 to your room. (Thus, you have to take the towel back to the pool the next day to turn it back in to avoid the charge.) The beach is pretty small and is right off of the main road (Ashford). Casino is open 24hrs but not all the tables are open all the time. They have one or two tables operating in 'off-peak' times. (before noon) There is no shuttle from the airport. (It's about 15 mins away from airport) Old San Juan is just over the bridge a few miles and is a great place to eat and walk around. A taxi will take you for 14.00/each way. Parking in the hotel is 16.00/day to self-park. Checkout was the worst part of my trip. Having stayed for two weeks I had a LONG bill and decided to go to the desk early to get a print-out to review the bill before checking out. I reviewed over breakfast and noticed a charge for the in room water (7.00) that I did not consume. The front desk removed the charge once I told them--no problem. Everything else seemed accurate and I decided to pay and check-out. I asked if possible to put 'incidentals(food) on one bill and the room + tax on another bill' with two forms of payment for work voucher reasons. She told me it was not a problem--It took 45 mins for me to get checked out. There was an issue separating the charges into different folios and apparently was much more complicated than I thought it would be. The girl became visible agitated and annoyed with the whole process. Her co-worker (Oneida?) helped her and figured out the issues. Once printed I noticed a charge that should not have been on the food bill, it was a room fee. I showed her and they fixed it but at this point everyone was frustrated. If they told me it was THAT difficult to split the charges I would not have done it. As I walked away and said 'thank you' she didn't say a word and her acted highly annoyed at me for something that she couldn't figure out. After spending that amount of money I would expect a 'thank you' in reply from the front desk check out staff. Overall, I enoyed the hotel property and all the amenities.

The Conrad was one of our best available options, so we took it. However, as clean and comfortable as the property was, I think I'd opt for another hotel for future SJ visits. The hotel has two buildings - one right on the waterfront and one across the street. Due to our last minute booking, both of our rooms were across the street. However, we were lucky to have a corner room facing the lagoon which still had a beautiful view. Be sure to ask for a corner room if you can if you're relegated to the other side of the hotel. Our room was moderate size, average furnishings, but very clean (and the bed was extremely comfortable.) Because my husband and I had a corner room, we also had a large bathroom but my family members on a higher floor in a suite had a tiny bathroom. I wouldn't say that's a make or break. The hotel pool is very nice, and the little tiny lagoon/beach has warm water (hotel guests also get a wrist band for free lounge chairs.) The hotel itself is also in a great location - short cab ride to Old San Juan and the airport, and walking distance to shops and restaurants down the street if you're looking to get off the hotel property. The biggest cons are these - for the price, this is by no means a luxury property. I wasn't \"wowed\" by the property, decor, rooms or facilities by any means. But the biggest down side is by FAR the poor service. We tried to use the concierge several times, to no avail. Once they booked us on a trip, charged our credit cards, and then literally 5 seconds later told us the trip had been sold out. Then, they referred us to local restaurants and promised we didn't need a reservation - and then we showed up to a long line. Every time we asked for towels or local tips, we were meant with very rude hotel staff (the towels were never even delivered.) We also asked on New Year's if we'd be able to see fireworks, to which a manager at the front desk told us she had \"no idea.\" And then at midnight we could see not 1 but 3 fireworks shows (and would've been in a better position to see them had we known!)

No. It was the appalling way in which we were treated by the staff every single day we were there. I'll only post these two examples so as not to bore the reader: I had made the reservation nearly three months in advance because we needed a crib for our baby daughter and I know these things can be tricky if you fail to ask for one with some anticipation. Morover, I called the hotel the week and then the day before our arrival to ensure we'd have the crib ready for the baby to sleep off the long trip there. We get to the hotel at four in the afternoon and, of course, there's no crib to be found. We waited and called the front desk and then called again and waited some more until, finally, at 8:30pm, we received the ugliest, most jail-cell-like contraption for infants we'd ever seen.

First of all i always search for location on when planning a trip. It is well centered between Old San Juan and Condado. It is next to the new \"Puente dos Hermanos\", which takes straight to Old San Juan, beautiful to walk on, not only during the day but wonderful at night. To the other side it takes you to the Ashford Avenue, which is filled with wonderful restaurants of all tastes and budgets, from caribbean, korean, mexican, italian to fusion food. The hotel is well furnished, the rooms are fully renovated and beautifully decorated and super comfortable. The beds are super comfortable, if going with a couple, a great king size bed, with lots of pillows. If going with kids, there are some rooms that have a separtae room with a door with a queen size bed and another with 2 twin beds, separated by the hall were the bathroom and closet is. They have mini refrigerators and microwaves. Free Internet service, great range, no matter were you are if you're traveling for business. Everyone is very nice and willing to make you as comfortable as possible, and to help if you need anything. The pool area is great, they have a ocean water pool, and a normal pool which has a bar in it, and also a cool slide for the kids. The area is beautiful, how it is arranged. Very a relaxing with all the palm trees, the sound of waves crashing, and if needed a nice hammock nap. Great views for pictures. You're also steps from the beach, where you can rent surf boards, kayaks, go paddle boarding. Great activities for friends, couples and families. Also has a fun Casino always filled with activities. If you like to exercise, the gym is amaaaazing, lots of machines from treadmills each with incorporated tv, elliptical and bikes , another area for weights with a TV. Another area with mats, if you want to stretch, do yoga or work out with kettle balls. The best part of the gym, is it has it's own sauna, and small spa pool after a great work-ot.Suits everybody. Trust me you won't be disappointed. To din, Starting inside the Hotel you have \"Pikayo\", which is on the expensive side, but well worth it for a nice night out. \"Casa Lola\", is fun restaurant, latin fusion, great cocktails and very close to the hotel. There is also \"Ropa Vieja\" which is also latin food, and more relax than Casa Lola. Others that would recommend, Budatai, Jose Jose, Bar Gitano. All are great for a fun night out if your traveling with friends or couple because they have music and get trendy starting on thursdays. They all have websites so check them out. If you love to walk around, Condado is great. Condado never sleeps, lots of people walking, great atmosphere with open \"plaza\" leading to the beach like \"Ventana al Mar\", also surrounded with open bars. So you can enjoy the cool breeze with a nice cocktail. Condado also has little shops, if you enjoy a vacation shopping spree for shoes, clothes and bags. This is only Condado, but Old San Juan has so many things to do, from visiting the fort \"El Morro\" or \"San Cristobal\". \"El Morro\" you can start by visiting the fort inside, then after sit around the nice grass plains and fly a kite with the kids, while enjoying a \"piragua'(sort of like a frozen drink, it's crushed ice, with whatever flavor you like). Also visit the beautiful Churches like \"Iglesia San Francisco\" or the cathedral \"Catedral de San Juan\", the different plazas were you can feed the pigeons, great restaurants after all the walking around and getting a feel of Old San Juan. Taking a walk, on the \"Camino de la princesa\" which is a trail were you walk behind the fort next to the water, very nice too. The best way is to ask locals, and they'll be happy to guide you to where you want to go, from restaurants or salsa dancing.

An elevated walkway across Ashford connects the buildings. We opted to stay in the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153lagoon-facing\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd building which appeared to be the older of the two buildings We had booked only one night as our cruise departed th next day. The check-in desk is in the newer building. We checked in without event and walked across the elevated walkway to the other building, took the elevator to the 10th floor and found are room quickly. We were fortunate to have been assigned a corner room which overlooked Condado, with views of the rushing waters crashing through the rocky inlet from the ocean. Further, the room had a very large wrap-around balcony, which was quite impressive. The room had been renovated probably some years ago, and was appointed in a somewhat modern d\u00c3\u00a9cor, but it was very clean and neat with plenty of natural window light. The bathroom was relatively small, but manageable. So overall we were happy with the room and its location. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s when things began to deteriorate. When we first entered the room, we had noticed the personal safe which was located in the open on a shelf in a built-in wooden cabinet about thigh high, a few feet from the entrance. The LED on the safe was blinking in bright red \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Call Service\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. A working safe was important to us because we didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t want to carry our assortment of cameras, kindles, laptops, jewelry and other valuables with us when we explored Old San Juan. We called the front desk and the receptionist promised that someone would be there in 10-15 minutes to address the issue. An hour later two gentlemen showed up to look at the safe: the safe technician, and a security person. After 15 minutes of diagnostic activity, the safe technician concluded that the safe couldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be repaired and that if I wanted a working safe, I would have to change rooms. I asked why couldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t the safe be replaced and was told that it wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t possible to do spontaneously because it was very involved and wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t something they do on a week-end. So now I started to become annoyed. I called the front desk and asked for the Hotel Manager. I was annoyed because the cleaning staff must have seen this blinking LED and did nothing about it. The Hotel Manager listened to my rant quite sympathetically. First she offered to move us to a business suite set up with printers, fax machines etc. but it had no view, was industrial-looking and we were in no need for office services. So we turned it down. Next she suggested we move to the vacant room directly across the hall. We agreed. The new room was a corner room somewhat similar to the one we left but it didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have the wrap around balcony and had much less natural light. I checked the safe, and it worked OK. Then I headed to the small balcony which appeared to have a great view of Old San Juan. I opened the door to the balcony, stepped out and immediately submerged my right foot in about five inches of water which had collected on the balcony. I pulled back quickly and stepped back into the room, but my right sneaker was completely saturated with water and as I stepped back I tracked water all over the place. My wife noticed immediately and said the apparent: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153You\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re getting water all over the place; take the sneaker off and get it to the bathroom\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. So I mightily pulled the saturated sneaker off and hopped to the bathroom, depositing the sneaker in the shower. I was beyond angry at this point, the broken safe, changing rooms, Lake Balcony. My wife pulled me back to my senses when she reminded me that we were only there for one night, just forget about it and let\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s go to dinner. So I pulled on my soaked sneaker and headed off to Old San Juan with the sneaker making a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153ka-swish-wush\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd sound at every step. Later, when we returned that night we found the room to be very hot. I cranked up the AC and immediately heard this tremendous sound. It was the sound a metal garbage can makes when it rolls down a driveway, but constant. It was 11PM and I really didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t want to call the front desk and start another room change. So I left the AC on for as long as we could stand it and, when the room had cooled down, I turned it off for the night. In the morning the room was sweltering but when I put the AC on the noise was gone. Unbelievable! After Breakfast we went back to the lobby in the main building to check-out. I went to the first available staff but as I approached the counter he said rudely that his position was closed and that I should wait in line on the other side of the pillar. So he gave me all these hand signals so that I would stand in exactly the right place, in this imaginary line. I looked for a sign saying \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Line Starts Here\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd or something like it, but there was nothing. No valor ropes, nothing. As I waited other guests were walking right up to check out as the position became vacant completely ignorant that I was standing in line. The check-out counter was so long that I couldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t get to the open positions quickly enough. I should have been angry but I wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t. I was at peace and I thought there was no need to get upset because I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m never coming back to this place again. Finally, a position opened directly in front of me. As I approached the agent he said with a big smile: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Good Morning, Sir. How was your stay?\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd I replied wryly: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It was unbelievable.

The Conrad is definitely a beautiful four-star hotel, but there are a few problems with its location (which I'll get into later) The interior of this hotel is beautiful. The lobby and rooms are designed in a ultra modern style. Check-in took all of 5 minutes, there was no one in line when I arrived at around 3:00pm. I belong to the Hilton Honors program with Gold status, so I was given a free upgrade to an ocean-view room as well as four $7 vouchers for breakfast. The hotel provides free WiFi to everyone (with password). The ocean-view side is the best side. The views are beautiful, with waves crashing against rocks below, boats floating by on the horizon, and, during the day, small planes and helicopters buzzing by from the small airport nearby. I even briefly saw a manatee surface (which is rare). Try to get an ocean view room, or pay for an upgrade if you have to. The Conrad is actually two separate towers for the hotel connected by a walkway over Ashford Ave. I've never stayed on the other side, so I can comment on the quality over there. The double-bed room was huge. The bathroom had a lot of space. You can literally walk around in the bathroom as opposed to just shuffling a few feet back and forth like most hotels. There was a walk-in shower with glass walls, a large sink, and roomy area for the toilet. On the other side are the small fridge, coffee maker, shelves, iron and ironing board. The hotel has a nice pool area. There are actually two pools, one saltwater, one fresh water. There is a heated jacuzzi by the saltwater pool. They give you fresh towels for the pool for free, and you can rent various water toys, paddleboats, snorkling gear, etc for a fee as well. There is a third, smaller pool on the hotels other tower. It has a jacuzzi has well. In the main pool area, there is an in-pool bar that serves food and drinks. There is a lagoon area with a beach connected to the primary pool area. This lagoon is pretty cool, as it's created by a huge row of rocks that block it off from the ocean. It's fed by water crashing over the rocks into the lagoon. I appreciated the lagoon more this year than last. The lagoon's tiny beach is located next to a road, and a (finally) finished bridge that looks nice now that it's done. The lagoon beach wasn't at all noisy or obtrusive. The hotel provides free beach chairs to hotel patrons. The best thing about the lagoon is that there are lots of exotic fish in the water. I saw 5 different kinds just walking around. Rent snorkeling gear and you'll see lots more. The biggest problem with the lagoon is that seafloor is covered with rocks that'll hurt your feet walking around. It's not a great swimming area. Still, I enjoyed spending an afternoon here. But for a real beach experience, either walk down to Conado beach (for big waves) or take the bus to Isla Verde (for small waves). My main complaint about the Conrad is its poor location. You have to walk 20 minutes to get to a nice tourist area. My suggestion for the immediate area: eat at Ropa Vieja for dinner and get desert at the Cold Stone Creamery close by, but travel elsewhere for food. The hotel is also surrounded by abandoned hotels, making the immediate area look a little slum-like. I would stay here again (I have twice won this hotel through Priceline for between $110-$135 plus $15/day Resort fee).", "Date": "January 27, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Grand Island, NY", "Title": "\u201cGreat location, very nice hotel\u201d", "Author": "MikeEGrandIsland_NY", "ReviewID": "UR123641348", "Content": "Very nice hotel.

I walked there and they were closed Sundays (for the entire day - every sunday). I thought they should have know that. I thought the prices, taxi's, drinks, food and excursions were very expensive. Our food room service was $130, but charged almost $178 with taxes and hotel delivery room fee, was 35%+ in total taxes & fees.

We were told it would be from 8:30 to 4:00. We were back at 12:30. When asked concierge to help because they booked it, they said they would call us after they conferred with company. They called us back and told us they would refund us $10 total for both people ($5 each person) and we paid $378. We said that is totally unacceptable. Concierge said they would call us back. We never heard from them again. Our flight was next afternoon, but our cell phone is the same number. Most of the bar and wait staff didn't speak good english and I think it made us feel a bit excluded, a bit avoided, because couldn't really communicate well and it was awkward.

We paid $1,700 for a \"special rate\" in advance with Expedia and got confirmation for a 2-Queen Oceanside room. But at check-in, they had none. How could that be possible when I paid and booked in October? We reluctantly accepted a $50 credit and were told we could go oceanside in two nights. But on the third day, we were disappointed again. In this large hotel, the oceanside room given to us on the second floor was one of about 10 that didn't have a sit-on balcony like all the other floors! We also couldn't access the room from the hotel lobby elevators -- we had to go to the end of the halls by the outdoor pools. Discovering this at 10 p.m. didn't help--we gave in. But overall, we felt like perhaps our prepaid special rate status let them NOT provide the best value. The hotel itself is nice and modern with trendy decor. Wi-Fi worked better in a lobby than in the room. We had a small fridge, but after taking leftovers back the first night discovered there's no microwave. One outdoor pool is 6-feet deep only which keeps kids away. The other pool is large, with a slide and has a swim-up bar for drinks or eating on stools in the water. The hot tub was hot and large, about 14-feet by 20-feet. The small beach shown in the photos is actually public, but the chairs are from the hotel. They have a couple cruiser bikes to rent at $25/day but I'm not sure where you'd ride them on narrow streets. We had one meal in the Caribe Grill and it was fine. Self-Parking is tricky. You have to get your ticket validated at the valet station in the driveway 10 minutes before you leave. No one told us this, so we held up the line on Day 1 and everyone had to back down (it's underground) because there's no attendant at the exit. There is renovation going on down the street, so the area doesn't look first class. But we felt safe walking around and there were restaurants to walk to. Ropa Vieja Grill is nearby and had a full house every night. Although we had a rental car, we took a taxi to Old SJ for $15 (three people) because we read parking was a nightmare (yes, it looked awful). Except for the poor situation with our prepaid room, the hotel was a good place to stay in. Perhaps we should have demanded more than the $50 overall credit they gave us with an apology.

We arrived on 12/21 and departed on 12/27. We originally reserved a family suite but was unhappy with the room/view. We requested and was given the same suite on a different floor. Unfortunately, the shower did not work. When I went to the front desk, my goal was simply to expedite the fixing of the shower; however, the manager gave us a room upgrade to an oceanview room in the main tower. We were very happy with that. The rooms were clean and the beds were comfortable. We thought it was a bit odd that the closet/drawers were located in the bathroom but we got over it quickly. We had one dinner and one breakfast at Cafe Caribe. The food was pretty much what we expected - good but not great. We had Christmas dinner at Pikayo which was very good but a bit of a waste for our 2 children. Even with a $100 comp from the Casino it still cost $300.00 and we only ordered 1 glass of wine. The Aqua Bar was good - Ricky waited on us several times and we were very happy with him. The Noodle Bar was very good. We visited the Casino nightly and did well. We only wish they had another Poker Table open and that they upgraded their Game King Poker slot machines (they are only $0.25). Marie was the activities coordinator and WE LOVED HER. She was even able to get our 13 year old daughter involved in activities such as cookie decorating. The pool area was lovely and our children enjoyed the slide. We participated in Yoga and Zumba and had a blast. The beach was cozy and has a traveling ice cream man that was a favorite with our children. There was also a man serving BBQ and drinks (a bottle of water was $1.00 compared to $2.50 at the hotel). The trip coordinators were all lovely. We booked the \"New San Juan/Old San Juan\" tour. We don't advise it since the New San Juan tour included a drive by the new mall!!?? Just go directly to Old San Juan - it was wonderful to explore the forts and walk on the cobblestone streets. We loved that Starbucks was right outside the hotel. There are many places to eat if you don't mind walking along Ashford Avenue. We ate at Ropa Viega (sic) which was excellent and we would definitely go back but with reservations this time even though the wait wasn't that long. We also ate at Subway and Mike's Pizza with the children. Further down on Ashford are several high end retail stores such as Cartier. We were very happy with this trip especially since the year prior we vacationed at Atlantis in the Bahamas which cost 4x more than this trip, the food was astronomically expensive and, even worse, it was too cold to enjoy the water rides.

The location is awesome - super-duper close to the Beach, Walgreens, restaurants/bars, bus stop, and 15 minutes from the airport. We stayed at the tower where the pool is. The walls were a bit thin because some nights we could hear music pounding from one of the corporate event rooms down on the first floor (our room was on the third floor).

They had weight machines, free weights, medicine balls and even kettlebells! There's a steam room, sauna room, and even indoor jacuzzi. Interesting thing to note is everything inside their fitness faciltiy is co-ed. The indoor jacuzzi was awesome to have because the outdoor one was too freakin' hot!

I traveled to this property from Christmas day until New Years Day with my wife and two year old daughter. I am also from a \"snob\" town in NJ and I own several vacation clubs with 5 star resort company's hence when I travel I expect only the best. My family and I were beyond apprehensive/afraid to travel to this hotel after reading the comments that have been posted by previous guests. By writing this review I intend to provide you with the real truths about this property and the area so you can travel with some ease. Understand that people who review hotels on this or any site come from various areas of the country where the dollar goes farther and some who are not used to traveling at all. I have also learned and witnessed first hand that certain individuals will write a really poor review because they did not get something that they wanted from the hotel such as an upgrade. Having visited this hotel I can clearly say that I really cannot validate any of the comments that were listed by disgruntled unhappy guests. Understand that this property is at the far end of Condado Beach so you do have to walk approx 10 mins to get to the main area where the restaurants are. Keep in mind that several restaurants are within 3 mins of the hotel including Ropa Vieja and Chilis which I provided more information on below. If walking is an issue that you need to stay at a hotel that will better service your needs. Also understand that Puerto Rico is an Island and that almost everything needs to be brought in. Hence the fact that things cost more! See food area below. I attempted to give you a background on my trip and I also hi-lighted key areas below. When we arrived at the Condado Plaza we were greeted promptly by Andres(bell hop) who said they he would take care of our bags and have them up to our room in no time. Andres had a smile the entire week and was always there for us opening the door as we came back to the hotel from our daily walks. Next, we had the pleasure of meeting/dealing with Jaminelly who checked us in immediately(bare in mind we arrived on Christmas day and it was packed). I asked if we were able to get an upgrade and Jaminelly was able to take care of that for us without question. Her personality and willingness to help was infectious. We checked into the room and were pleasantly surprised and happy to be at this property. We stayed across the street in the building that sits on the lagoon side. The buildings are connected via a sky walk across the roadway. I still had an ocean view and a lagoon view. The room we were given was tremendous to the tune of a NYC apartment. We did not have the glass enclosed shower however we did have a tub and an enormous bathroom. This suited us better as we had a two year old with us who only takes baths. The room had two rooms for lack of a better description each of them with flat screen TV's. We had a fridge and microwave and enough closet/draw space for a huge family. All of the individuals we encountered during our vacation were polite, had smiles on their faces and went out of their way to ensure we had a great week. We always felt welcomed no matter where we were in the hotel. The hotel was manicured perfectly and members of the staff were always cleaning the various areas of the property on a daily basis. It seems as if others complained about the aesthtics of the building. When I travel I never have taken aesthetics into account. Yes the building is older. Yes they have completely redone the lobby and other areas. But who cares what the building looks like? Are you buying a condo or office across the street? No your their for a vacation and only should worry about service and amentities, not the fact that the building is getting worn. Activities/Amenities: As for activities, my wife and daughter loved the morning zumba and the activities for the kids were a nice thought including the movie by the pool, the feeding of the fish and the jump/bounce castle. Even the little things such as the ice pops and the starbucks samples were a great addition to a warm afternoon. The hotel also had great hammocks right by the ocean wall to lay on in the afternoon. I am not sure what else people would want from the resort. The hotel has three pools. The main pool is a huge L with a swim up bar (that has 20 seats) and a water slide. No its not typhoon lagoon at disney but it has several turns and is still fun. The beach is small and borders the road however, that is what you get where the location is in Condado. The beach had approx 250 people on it the day I was there, if thats not enough space for you I am not sure what is. I never had a problem with towels or chairs. In addition, the hotel instituted a security bracelet system to avoid anyone coming up from the beach that did not belong. The casino is small but has over 200 machines and 10-12 tables. Since you can only occupy one sit I am not sure why there is an issue. Cab ride to Old San Juan is $18-20 or you can take the bus for .75 Yoou can't blame the hotel for the bus not coming on time. Ashford ave gets backed up hence the buses get backed up. Food: Everything will cost you more in Puerto Rico. Even starbucks and dunkin donuts will be approx 50 cents to 1.00 more at least per item. There is a Walgreens approx 10 min walk down Ashford Ave. Walgreens is 24 hours and has everything from bottled water to liquor to a grocery section that has frozen aunt jemima pancakes etc. Go there get some basics to avoid having to get nailed for it everyday. The first day in we went to Chilis as we arrived late. What I can tell you for at least lunch there was only a difference of approximately $2 dollars per dish. To me it was worth it to just eat at the hotel for $2 more. The hotel was in line with every other restaurant in the area of the same quality. Yes, it is expensive for a burger 12.95 but its inline with other restaurants. It seems as if an average lunch will cost two people $30 with a tip. Dinner with two drinks, appetizer, two entrees and a desert in most restaurants will cost $100-110. Ropa Vieja: a must go to. 3-5 minute walk from hotel. Puerto Rican cuisine. Order the sampler platter and a must have is the ropa vieja which is shredded steak. I also had the seafood risotto which was amazing. Miro: Seafood approx 10 min walk from hotel. This was one of the best meals I have eaten and I am from the NY area. we had the calamari which was amazing and seafood paella for two. The profiterole we ordered were all eaten by my two year old before we could get to it. Tijuanas: 10 minute walk down ashford one block past miro. This is the best mexican food in the area and great prices. Be careful if you order the madre magarita as it will cost you more than your entire bill and will make you so drunk that you will not get home. Its a huge huge punch bowl! However the meals here are within $14 to $20 range. Voga: this is located 5-7 minutes down ashford ave in the renaissance hotel. It was an upscale italian meal. I ordered the lasagna which was pasta noodles made fresh. My wife had the chicken marsala which was huge. We ordered spinach dip as an appetizer and sharerd the cheesecake lollipops. This restaurant was really good. Service was great and food quality was very good. Al Dente: We originally tried to eat at Raices both of these are in Old San Juan. Unfortunately Raices was way too busy but if you have the opportunity go eat there. Al Dente was great food, reasonable prices but slightly high. Service was great. Dannys International and Mike's Pizza good for lunch or pizza. Breakfast we ate twice at the hotel and it was approxiamtely $30 for two omlettes and juices and a muffin. slightly expensive but if you eat off site its approximately $10 per dish plus tax and tip. The only issue that we had was that Aqua the restaurant by the pool was unable to handle to amount of people that came into the patio restaurant one day and it take forver to get food. However, Julio took care of our bill because we waited too long. This problem was corrected the next day and food and beverage managers were onsite to make sure things were going smooth. The following individuals made our stay: Aqua: Ninatoshka was a great server who always went out of her way to see my daughter Maya whether we ate at the restaurant or not. She always had a smile on her face and spent time talking to me and my wife while we sat down to eat. Housekeeping: Norma who serviced the room was great. She made sure we had anything we needed and the room was always in perfect clean order. Activities Staff: Both of the activities personnel who conducted Zumba(I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t remember their names)were great. They always went out of their way to ensure guests were having a good time. One morning our chairs were in the way of Zumba and needed to be moved. These individuals did not let us move our chairs, they insisted that they took care of it. They also made sure to come and get my two year old daughter to do zumba as they saw she really enjoyed it. Again, going above and beyond. Bell Hop: Andres Pool: Locastra was always asking how she could make things better. Monica at the towel desk always had a smile on and made sure to tell every guest to have a great day and enjoy the weather. We will definitely be coming back to the Condado Plaza in the near future.

First off we booked an ocean view room and when we checked in the lady at the front desk proceeded to check us in without telling us we would be overlooking a roof and the other side of the hotel. When we went to complain, we were told that there were no more rooms available. They suggested we wait until tomorrow and then move. When we explained how inconvenient this was, they said nothing could be done. We were not comfortable with wasting a day moving as we would have to vacate our temporary room by the noontime checkout and not move into the new room until after 3 PM at the earliest. We told them we would not move but wanted an adjustment for the room. I guess to front desk managers William Ibhern and Victor Diaz they felt I was asking them to find a cure for cancer. Their incompentence level was amazing!!! Not only did I have to spend an hour inquiring about my adjustment each day, but ultimately I had to get another manager to resolve the problem. That manager only resolved the problem because it was my last day and I was refusing to settle my bill. The worst part was that we had booked three roooms at this hotel and they did this to each of us. One of the days when I was arguing with Victor Diaz another guest was having it out with the front desk because she made the mistake of trying to switch the next day and was moved to another non ocean view room. The entire staff at this hotel could get nothing right. My room was never made before 5 PM, each day at breakfast they consistently got our orders wrong and we had to wait over a half hour for them to bring it after ordering, the bartenders at the pool bar would never bring our food orders and then when we cancelled they tried to charge us and finally the waitress tending to us at the beach showed up twice over a 4 hour period (once to take our drink orders and 40 minutes later to drop them off).

The woman at the front desk first told me to call the website I booked through to discuss the matter with them, which clearly didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t make sense since I wanted to just pay the hotel for an upgrade. The website stated I needed to call the Conrad and figure it out with them. After calling back and forth, a Conrad employee then told me that whomever was working the front desk upon my check in could grant me an upgrade if they wanted to. I continued to tell her that I wanted to pay the hotel for an ocean view not chance a possible \"free\" upgrade. At that point the conversation seemed to dwindle. I then called and emailed Leah Rossi, the Concierge Guest Services Manager, whose name I found on other Trip Advisor reviews and asked the same question. She personally called me back in a couple of days (she was on vacation- emailed stated) and after I explained my previous encounter with the front desk, she granted us a free ocean view upgrade. Arrival/Rooms: Flawless\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 we checked in within 2 minutes and were given our keys to a 9th floor ocean view room. The style of the reception floor is contemporary and was nicely covered with Christmas decorations. The Conrad hosts a couple of bars on the first floor as well as an overpriced gift shop which sells from t-shirts, to shaving cream, to beer, to chips, jewelry\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 etc. Our room was quite nice. Shades of orange and red throughout complemented each other nicely. The standup shower was fully see- through, but there were doors to the bathroom. The bathroom was very large with dark mahogany- like closets/ drawers that also hosted a coffee machine and refrigerator. We especially liked how we could hang our wrinkled clothes and the steam from the shower took them right out. The marble sink countertop was nice as well as the large mirror that hosted great light. The room had a red couch, a comfy king bed and a desk with a slim new television. The balcony at the foot of the room overlooking the ocean was amazing and highly recommended. Was the room the nicest room we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve ever stayed in? No, but I will stress we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re not very picky people. Pools/ Beach: Talk about saving your seat at the pool! I will let you in on some secrets. The main hotel hosts a salt-water pool, a Jacuzzi and a large swim up pool with a small slide to the right. The trees around these pools can really block the sun, so if you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re not looking to get your tan on- I would suggest finding a shady seat around here. The beach is attached to the main hotel and has chairs as well. It is definitely not the best beach you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll ever encounter, but a nice alternative to the pools. Towels are found at the little doorway to your right as your go down the stairs exiting the hotel- you just have to return them within a certain time. Now the secret\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 the lagoon side of the hotel hosts a quiet sunny pool, which you can access by going to the casino floor and through a tunnel across the street, or at street level. There is more sun, less of saving seats and peacefulness. Here you will also find the tennis counts, paddle boarding and kayaking (minimal fee). Activities: On the first day, we were approached by a woman named Mari who seemed to be the activities director. We went on the power walk, which was very informative and Mari did a great job showing us different beaches and pointing out other restaurants. There was also Zumba and Yoga being offered that day. We used the gym once in our 2 -day stay. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s located on the lagoon side and is a decent size. It has many machines and weights for just about anyone. There are bathrooms and towels as well. The casino, located on the second floor is quaint and has tables and slot machines. We didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t win anything. Dinner: Well we missed our first dinner in Old San Juan (Marmalade) due to our late flight, so we ordered room service. Room service is room service to us. We really ate it and went to bed. The second night we ate at the hotel\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s restaurant Pikayo, which has excellent reviews. I will interrupt the review here and state that we are people that have eaten at 5 star restaurants and also enjoy a nice cheeseburger on any given day. Some of the two person tables are very close other couples. Other tables although are very spaced out. The lighting is on the darker side and the table clothes are crisp and clean. We started off with two sangrias. For a cold appetizer we decided on the tuna, which we didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t really enjoy. The tuna was layered on something that tasted like a rice cake- no flavor. We also had the mofonguitos, which we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re well seasoned and pretty tasty. We split a salad with feta cheese, which was very light and nothing special. I had the salmon, which was nicely textured and cooked well and my husband had the beef tenderloin with blue cheese, which he thought was cooked perfectly and tasted awesome. For dessert my husband had cr\u00c3\u00a8me bruleee and I had some chocolate dish. They both were very sweet and good. The service was really good, but almost too overwhelming. It seemed like there was always someone at our table doing something. What happened after dinner though was a little rough. Right at the exit of the restaurant as we were leaving a huge cockroach came from the outside wall of Pikayo running on the ground in front of many people. A woman started yelling for my husband to get it and he most certainly did. He stayed around it as I went back in to the restaurant to tell the ma\u00c3\u00aetre de that there was a dead cockroach that we just killed outside the restaurant. Three minutes later a man came and swept it up, but no one from the restaurant apologized or thanked us. In addition, the hotel has a noodle restaurant, a deli/sandwich caf\u00c3\u00a9 that has similar food to the poolside restaurant, a pizza establishment and a Starbucks outside the hotel. There is a little coffee bar in the middle of the hotel also that serves light pastries in the morning and then switches to a bar. Extra: Santa made a visit to the hotel; there was a bouncy house out back, bingo and a big checkerboard were available by the pool. Upon leaving the hotel a very nice employee took care of our check out as we exited the elevator and so we didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have to wait in line. The hotel went all out for Christmas, with a huge party. The music could be heard all the way in our room \u00e2\u20ac\u201c 9th floor. The elevators overall were a tad slow in general, but there is an elevator by the pools which seemed to be faster. Overall, would we stay here again- yes! The location is great and very central which we prefer. There are definitely some hit or misses with the hotel, but it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a nice place to lay your head and be on vacation..

The weather was perfect and the the oceanview room was breathtaking. I will list the pros and cons of the conrad: Pro: The staff was wonderful and upgrated our room (upon request, you do have to ask though) to the 10th floor oceanview room. The view from the balcony was truely amazing. The room was quaint and clean but smaller than I was expecting for it being \"one of the best rooms in the hotel\" as was told to us. It was decent enough, just not what I was invisioning. I expected wow and was ok. The location is great, just a hop outside on the local bus (DO NOT drive here, its absolutley crazy) and it takes you right into old San Juan. Con: The doors to the patio were very heavy and don't stay open by themselves at all. You either have to go out or come in, no enjoying the ocean air while in bed. The noise was obtrusive to say the least. There was a wedding being held that evening and the loud music was blaring well into the next morning, we could not sleep it was so loud and we were on the top floor, I can't imagine what the guests on lower floors were thinking. We did not have a room service menu and requested one 3 times and never did get one. Don't waste your time at the hotel fru fru overpriced restaurant, not worth the money, There are plenty of great little mom and pop type places that are well worth the quick walk down the street. The beach area was very small and they charge you to use the many umbrellas there. The pool is nice but the hotel was more of a party type spot for the younger 20 something crowd, not very romantic for couples. Overall it was a nice place to stay, a bit on the small side and not extravagant. If it was not for the ocean view it would not have been worth the money to stay here. If I go to PR again, I will check out a different hotel for the price, I liked the red decor, but it was not a 4 star hotel, more like a suped up holiday inn, only smaller and the rooms had a dampness feel about them.

It's conveniently located just off highway 26 coming from the airport, but a little ways from the main Condado resort/shopping area. It's not a huge inconvenience (we did the 10 minute walk nightly for dinner), but it's something to keep in mind compared to some of the neighboring (and more expensive) resorts. On site services: there is on-site parking ($16/day self-pay), three pools (one salt-water, one across the street in the lagoon-side tower), two hot tubs (again, one in the lagoon tower), a 24-hour casino, a pool-side bar/cafe and several restaurants. There is a same-day laundry service, and AT&T wi-fi throughout the hotel, including pool-side and at the adjacent beach. Staff service: Overall, exceptional staff service between the front desk, housekeeping, the concierge and the food/bar wait staff. The rooms: We stayed in an ocean view king. The rooms were spacious, well-appointed, and recently renovated. The bed was quite comfortable, a little soft but still supportive, and came with down pillows and comforters. Linens/towels were of high quality. Room appointments include a flat panel tv, mini-fridge, microwave, coffee-maker, safe and ironing board. A few issues: - Our room had no storage space for clothes aside from the closet. (of note, we were traveling with friends who stayed in a city-view room and they DID have drawers). - Ocean view rooms come with an expansive, solid, well constructed floor-to-ceiling window with locking glass door. By contrast, our friends in the city-view room had a rickety sliding glass door that didn't fully close and rattled with the wind. - Some rooms come with a full glass shower in the middle of the bathroom. Some people think this is weird. - The bathroom doors are sliding doors which provide visual privacy but offer no sound barrier. May be an issue if you have guests over. Beach access: There is a small sandy public beach adjacent to the hotel, and the hotel provides free beach chairs and the bar will deliver food/drink to the beach area. The water is protected by a breakwater, which is safer than the unprotected Condado beach a few minutes away, but the sand here is rockier than Condado. The food: There are several restaurants to choose from, including a couple of standard-fare operations that provide decent, acceptable but not spectacular fare (we ate at these places a couple of times for breakfast and lunch), along with a higher-end new american restaurant, as well as an asian fusion noodle bar, neither of which we tried. Overall: We really enjoyed our stay here. If we were staying in San Juan again, we might pick a place with better access to one of the better local beaches, but otherwise was not disappointed in the least and would stay here again.", "Date": "December 3, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Co.

Also, people complained about the parking charge - $16 is NOTHING if you travel a lot. Chicago it's $35-50, South Beach $25, San Francisco - $50 - $60 per night. People need to get a clue.

Urban setting. Was in a lagoon-side room, necessitating a skywalk trip to the main hotel, which wasn't bad as long as you don't mind walking past the casino each way. The big complaint is that part of the hotel is in the take-off path of a nearby airport such that all the single- and two-engine planes roar right over our room, pretty much guaranteeing a 6:00am wake-up time. Location otherwise was decent: a cheap taxi ride to Old San Juan, and the major tour companies pick up right at the hotel lobby. Plenty of dining opportunities within walking distance east of the hotel, in addition to the on-site restaurants. Adjacent to the main hotel is a token (public) beach about about two-hundred feet wide. Towel location hidden and non-obvious. Remember to get your hotel wristband when you get your towel so that the beach personnel will know you from the riff-raff and set up your lounge chair. View at the beach was across the bay of... other hotels. Nice pools with one having a poolside bar that nobody used. The hot tub of the main building was a cold tub while we were there (no obvious switch to warm it, so I'll assume it was broken). The lagoon-side building had its own pool, and a hot tub that was hot. Staff was very friendly, and the concierge even offered us towels for our Bioluminescent Bay tour. Small bar on mezzanine had very friendly bartenders. Staff passing us in hallway always greeted us. Cleanliness-wise, it was good, though when we got there the soap in the shower was obviously used with a hair on it. Aside from that, no complaints. Rooms have a laptop-accommodating size safe where you set the four-number combination. For those of you that need your Starbucks fix, there's one right outside the lobby door (but they don't take Starbucks cards; they'll give you a 10% discount card instead). If you walk a couple blocks further east there's a neat local place that serves breakfast with an oceanside view. Another note: if you're going to go on tours of bioluminescent bay, rain forest, snorkeling, etc., you're in the wrong location, since a lot of that stuff is on the east side of the island. While the tour companies pick you up, you're in for a 45-60 minute bus ride each way. I would stay here again, modulo the aircraft noise, if I needed to be in the same area.

That said, we didn't spend too much time in the room anyway - there was just too much to do at the hotel and the area surrounding it. We especially liked the pool area and the grounds around it; hammocks for guests to lounge in were really special. We would stay here again in a heart beat - but would make our own arrangements rather than going through the cruise line.

It is a little confusing to get your bearings the first time in the lobby but after a while, we got used to it.

Prices are based if you have ocean, lagoon or street view. The check-in process was smooth with a very professional staff. The concierge were very friendly and attentive. The main building has a great pool with a slide, volleyball net, poolbar and plenty of seating around. There is a smaller 'salt' pool as the beach area is small and it is for those who do not want to deal with the sand. Finally there is also a whirlpool. The beach is quite small but never crowded. There is also a Starbucks next door where you can charge your purchases to the room. Massages by the pool are offered but it is very expensive. The room is quite nice with a nice big bed facing the ocean. All rooms have balconies to sit outside and enjoy the ocean view and listen to the waves breaking against the coral reef and feel the nice warm breeze. There is also a nice couch to watch tv. The only problem is that the tv is very small and was quite disappointing. The bathroom was one of the biggest I've seen with a huge shower, a refrigerator, coffee machine and a big mirror and sink.

We get to the receptionist and we are informed that check-in is not until 4:00. We inform her that we have a trip planned to the bay at 4:15, could we possible check-in early, she said she would see what she could do. We were with another couple, she took both our phone numbers and promised to call when the rooms were ready. We never received any calls. We checked back at 3:45 with a long line ahead of us. We get to the receptionist to find out we have rooms at about 4:10. Run up to our rooms with our luggage, change clothes very stessed out and barely made it to our tour. All of this could have been avoided with the phone call they promised. Also after the first check-in they gave us a folder, telling us we could use any of the facilities until we got checked in. Our friends asked about beach towels for our tour and was refused because they \"needed a room number\"! Took the trip to the bay, then got back to the hotel about 11:30 p.m. They put us in the rooms across the street that is nothing like the pictures you see on their website. These rooms are very old and tired looking, nothing like we expected out of a Conrad. I think what they have done is bought a different hotel across the street and added a walkway. We went back to the receptionist and asked for a different room in the original Conrad. She replied that there was nothing available, which I responded that I would like to talk to a supervisor. All of sudden a room was available. Once we got into the new room we were happy with it, but as has been the case with this hotel all day, another small problem...no tv remote. We just went to bed and didn't worry about it. We were glad we were only staying one night. I did say good and it was the probably the best beds we have slept in on vacation. The hotel is beautifully decorated and they finally did move us to another room. The only restaurant that we ate in was the Eight Noodle Bar. DO NOT RECOMMEND this restaurant. We had a roll that was way below average. My husband had the lo mein and said it was good, I had the shrimp fried rice which was shrimp, white rice, maybe one scambled egg and some scallions thrown in it. I thought I was going to have to use a whole bottle of soy sauce just to give it a little flavor. This meal w/3 beers cost $60.00. Not worth it! The location of the hotel is good, but there are other hotels nearby that are much better. I have stayed at the Caribe Hilton many times and would definitely recommend it over this hotel. A friend has stayed at La Conche a couple of times and raved about the hotel and customer service there.

We (two guests) stayed in the Lagoon tower, and our room was well-appointed and modern, with an ample balcony. The decor in much of the hotel is a bit on the Austin Powers side, but they own it. There's a legit bar in the lobby, and one in the wading pool outdoors (drinks are about twice as expensive in the pool). On the lagoon side, they offer rentals of kayaks, paddle boards, and all sorts of man-powered vessels. The casino gets moderately busy in the evening, but we never saw it get packed. They offer blackjack and some other table games, craps when there is enough action, roulette, and of course lots of slots. Dealers were friendly and gracefully accepted my horrendous Spanish. We ate at the pan-asian/sushi bar, which was superb, though it is open to the casino. The \"fancy\" restaurant downstairs in the lagoon tower offers amazing meals, and the cafe-style restaurant above the lobby is good for a tasty bite. Dining on Condado is pricey, and the hotel's restaurants are no exception. We went to the Starbucks on the ground floor each morning for breakfast. Outstanding service everywhere in the hotel. The doormen will summon a cab for you in a hurry, and the day trip concierge was exceptionally helpful. We were tempted to spend our whole ten days in the hotel. The only negative about the Conrad is its location. It's isolated from downtown (which may be a plus for you). It has a little beach adjacent to the pool area, but you have to walk a mile or so to the \"real\" beach. The little beach is perfect for small kids, though; it's in a natural harbor, so there's shallow water with no surf.", "Date": "October 31, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cTreated like a rock star!!!\u201d", "Author": "K9Christyne", "ReviewID": "UR119844201", "Content": "I went to Puerto Rico to celebrate my birthday.

Just got back last week after spending 5 days there. All and all, it's an average hotel.It's definately not \"great\". The hotel needs work. You can tell it's been around a while. The pool was nice, but it desperately needed to be cleaned. Not the water, but the pool itself. Steps were dirty, almost looked list rust? The pool bar needed to be fixed. Just needs alot of of TLC. The staff was fine. Not overly friendly, but no complaints about them, just ask them, they will help you. Drinks are over priced.. $10 for a frozen drink that comes in a small plastic sup. Look for the happy hour deals. Beach was small, but nice. Bring the water shoes, you will need them. It's kind of rocky out there. Plenty of room in the pool area. I stayed in a king suite they called it. ( I think ). Big room, nice bed, with a private balcony ( ok, sort of private. People in the next balcony can see their neighbors) My room was on the 3rd floor, lagoon view. The higher up you are, the better view. You can walk a mile along the ocean, and hit just about every kind of eatery, and shop you can think of, so the location is good. There is a Walgreens about .75 miles away. Take a cab, go shopping, and stock up. Save some cash at the resturaunts in the hotel. We only ate at the \"Cafe Carib\" in the hotel. Food was moderately priced, and tasted moderate as well. If you want soda, or water, there is a soda machine at the bus stop outside the hotel. $1 for a bottle. Best deal in town. Load up, bring em back to your room. If you want to go to \"Old San Juan\", take the bus. It's .75 cents one way, exact change, coins only). They run about every 45 minutes. Ask the bellman which bus to take. As I mentioned, the bus stop is right outside the hotel. A cab will cost you a flat rate of $15. If you can get the ocean view room, go for it. That is, if you plan on spending more time in the room as opposed to going out often. Free WIFI in the hotel. The lobby was VERY nice. Clean, and modern with a huge aquarium. Cab ride from the airport is $15 plus $1 for each bag. Keep your receipts for the room charges. We found something that we were charged for, that we didn't order. We weren't the only ones. On Saturday, by far the busiest day, there was only 1 person working the pool bar. I counted 100 people in the pool area. Way too many people, for 1 person. We waited forever for drinks. Alot of our view was looking at the back of the attached building. I definately wasn't \"disappointed\" Maybe I was expecting too much from a hotel on the ocean in Puerto Rico, I travel frequently, so I know a little about hotels. This was was definately as average as average can get. It's not like I would cringe if my next meeting was scheduled there again. Oh, the casino sucks ( only because I lost as usual ) Hotel room doors are freakin noisy. Metal on metal clanking when they close. Maid service was fine, no complaints. Bathroom was FANTASTIC. Maybe it was because I had a king suite, but the shower was huge. Senior Frogs in Old San Juan is really fun. Music, dancing, and good drinks. This is where you want to go party. There's also a brewery ( forget the name). great local beer, and the food looked good (although we didn't eat there)", "Date": "October 4, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Boston, Massachusetts", "Title": "\u201cExcellent Weekend Stay\u201d", "Author": "SFC1976", "ReviewID": "UR118896895", "Content": "The mixed reviews of this property almost led me to cancel and book elsewhere - I'm glad I didn't. Prior stays at El San Juan and Caribe Hilton were disappointing for the price paid, but this stay at Conrad Condado Plaza went some considerable way to repairing my low expectations from San Juan hotels. The hotel is well located at the end of the Condado strip. It is formed of two buildings either side of Ashford Ave. The Lagoon Tower on one side and Ocean tower on the other. We received a complimentary upgrade to an ocean view room on the 7th floor. The proximity to the shoreline provided excellent views over the ocean and a peaceful vantage point from which you could enjoy the sounds of the waves crashing against the rocks. The room, as with the hotel itself was modern and contemporary in design. The decision to put all the storage in the bathroom was odd though - they could easily have made the bathroom smaller and put the closets and drawer space in the room itself. Housekeeping was adequate but not thorough with glasses and cups left dirty. Staff throughout the hotel were helpful and friendly, though the service at the pool bar could be slow - even though it didn't seem that busy. Noise from other rooms was minimal, but perhaps carpeted floors in the rooms would help when the guests in the room above are walking around in stilettos. Wi-Fi access in the rooms worked well and was fast enough to stream Netflix movies with only minor interruptions. The main pool was great for the kids with a small water slide and volleyball net. The beach is not private, but was never crowded. It benefits from some shelter from the waves being at the entrance to the lagoon, but beware the black sea urchins if you venture too close to the rocky area. A cabana overlooking the ocean was the location for massages at $45 per 30 mins. We didn't indulge, but spoke to someone who thoroughly enjoyed his massage. Loungers were plentiful and we had no problem finding a good spot at any time of day. Breakfast at the Cafe Caribe offered generous servings and the pricing was reasonable by hotel standards - don't bother with the so-called 'Continental Breakfast' offering though. Self parking below the hotel was $15 per day and there is a Starbucks right outside the front entrance.

As for the management, we were so disappointed with the Hotels poor communicaiton. Hurrican Irene hit the Island on our third day, the hotel lost power and it was down hill from there. We found out that the tower on the lagoon side had power, yet we were not moved as the hotel was saving it for the guests they were taking in from a cruise ship. The main elevator was shut down but the service elevator was in operation. Unfortunately after we began using the service elevators or stairs the Hotel set up signs outside of the main elevator to explain where food could be found, yet no one knew. We found out room service was available via word of mouth, but you had to go to the front desk to order. I would assume a Hotel of this calibur would have emergency instructions set in place, yet it seemed that No one knew what was going on. One guest said \"it's amazing, it appears that the only thing working in this entire Hotel is your BILLING\"! The Hotel did not so much as offer a Free cup of coffee to compensate for the lack of air conditioning or electricity. We lost 4 of the 6 days of our stay due to Hurrican Irene. We felt the Hotel could have offered comp time if we returned or a discount to our room rate.But opted to tell everyone, \"you used a room\". Such a poor attitude for such a huge hotel. This Hotel failed miserably within the guest relations sector!

They would answer questions with attitude they would never even want to help you. 20 min at the bar to get a drink. On other islands you have to beg for the waiters and bartenders to leave you alone. The cleaners forget to clean your room and the parking is a joke that you have to pay. Dont valet you can get your car quicker on your own. The beach or what they call it is right next to a bridge with trucks and back hoes repairing it, was tiny. The pools were fithly and the fitness center awful. The reason I gave it a 3 star was the room which was ocean view if you are across the street you are in the projects literally. The food: Cafe Caribe and the noodle bar were excellent. Cafe Caribe has an awesome breakfast and the noodle bar great chinese and sushi. The casino: Another reason it gets a 3 star. The casino dealers and waiters were the best around. So helpful and accomodating. They would check on your free drink every 3 min to make sure you had one. They also had free sandwiches and soup delivered right to the tables. The casino was awesome. Small minimums and awesome perks if you gambled with a players card. Make sure to get a rewards card. We got 75 dollars worth of beverage and food. Overall: I dont want to seem all negative.

However this is not a hotel you want to go to if you are thinking of beach. The other problem is that our family rented a car with the intention of not booking side trips through the hotel.

From the pictures of the hotel, it looks like it is on a great beach, but all it has is a lagoon beach that is rather shallow. Across the lagoon is the Caribe Hilton. To the left of the \"beach\" is the street and bridge over the lagoon with construction equipment, though nothing was going on when I was there. To the right of the lagoon is a rock wall separating the lagoon from the ocean, so the waves hit the rocks and dissipate so the lagoon is nice and calm. The hotel faces north and the ocean but there is no beach at all and you can't swim there. So aside from the misrepresentation of the beach, the hotel has been renovated but not 100%. Some of the public areas show their wear and tear; canopy covering the ocean facing balcony had enough holes so that when it was raining you could not sit and watch it rain without getting wet yourself. Another issue is that the walls must be pretty thin because you can hear the traffic if you are staying in a street facing room. Plus any time a door closed on your floor you would hear it and it was loud because the doors do not gently close due to the locks. Finally my colleague's room was not cleaned any of the three days there. When a complaint was lodged at the front desk, the front desk asked for a phone number to call after discussing with the manager, but instead of calling the cell number provided, the colleague's home number was called instead offering a credit which was not realized until the colleague returned home.

We live in Kansas, so when he asked if I'd like to come along I jumped at the chance. Since he'd be at work every day, we wanted a hotel where I would have choices on restaurants and activities and just an enjoyable place to relax and enjoy the view. We found it in the Conrad San Juan Condado Plaza. This hotel was absolutely perfect for my needs. We arrived Tuesday, July 26, 2011 and checked out on Sunday, July 31. Upon arrival, I was a little surprised. This was my first trip to San Juan and I had an expectation of a Caribbean blue/green color scheme. Not here. The primary color is a bold, fiery, bull-fighter red and it's everywhere. I'd read here at TripAdvisor to spend the extra money for an ocean view room and boy was that good advice! The view is amazing. In fact, beyond words. All ocean view rooms have a private balcony and I spent lots of time just sitting out there, listening to the ocean beating the sea wall below, and reading a book or drinking my morning coffee. It was unbelievably relaxing. The hotel staff was extremely friendly even recognizing me by my room number after only a few days. The staff at the restaurants were very friendly too. Everyone speaks English, so we had no translation problems and staff members were always willing to give advice on how to get around, where to go, what to do, etc. Even suggestions to restaurants off site. We ate breakfast everyday at the Caribe Cafe. The food is great and the view is awesome. There are three swimming pools to pick from and the main pool with the swim-up bar had the most activity. There is a slide for the kids, staff members walked around and ask for participants in pool volleyball, a wide variety of music playing, and the outdoor restaurant, Aqua, was there for food. I also found myself going to the casino on a regular basis. I'm not much of a gambler, so the penny slots was my major attraction, although a couple evenings my husband and I did play the roulette table. I can't say I was a big winner, but I had lots of fun. Off the main pool, there is an entrance to a public beach. It's in a cove, so the waves are not too rough. Weekends are really busy here. I thought I would spend more time here, but as it turned out, I only swam at that main pool. My husband and I did take a walk on the beach and wriggle our toes in the sand. If you do love salt water, one of the three pools is a saltwater pool. If you do leave the hotel, there are a number of restaurants nearby. If you want to walk further -- maybe 1 mile -- there is a Walgreen's, an American fast-food (Wendy's, I think ... maybe Burger King), and lots of local shops. For those on the business side, there is free internet service.

I eventually decided to ask a different clerk, and found out the room had been ready. The lobby is extremely loud at night, with disco music blasting from the bar, and you will be spending a lot of time waiting in that lobby. I would not have returned, but as I said, we had already paid for the second stay a week later. Again, we received the same line \"your room is not ready.\" This time, I knew enough to ask a different clerk and we got into a room. The problem I think is just the desk clerks knowing what they're doing. Same thing with the supposedly free breakfast included in your rate. The first time, they gave us a $15 voucher for each of us. The second time, the clerk said only one person could get a voucher. $15 in that restaurant won't cover much. In any case, that is not what was advertised, and different clerks should not have different policies. Last, as mentioned, the restaurant at this hotel is very overpriced and very slow.

So much, I am a owner in their vacation club. So, when my girlfriends and I decided to go back to San Juan, we selected the Conrad Condado Plaza for the second time. I have to say I was VERY disappointed. When we arrived, we waited in line for 20mins before checking in. We were also surprised to know that there was a $50.00 per day hold required via a major credit card. This is something they forget to tell you when you book at this hotel. So for 5 days, the hotel placed a $250.00 hold on my credit card. I later realized that was the reason why the check in line was so long, people before me was fight over the credit card hold. A lot of people didn't bring major credit cards, just debit. So they were having major problems checking in. Moving on.....When we finally got to our room, the floors were dirty in the main room and bathroom. The curtains was torn the middle and the sitting chair had a huge white stain in the middle, nasty. But, the icing on the cake was the roach I found in the shower. Yes, you hear me, a live roach just chillin in the shower. I call the front desk and I was quickly transferred to housekeeper. IWhy housekeeping, I have no idea. I was told the person who took care of matters like this went home for the night. But, they sent someone help to dispose of the current problem. 15mins later I received a knock at the door, it was a maid with a wet mop and a doorman with trash bags and a roll of paper towels. I quickly lead them to the bathroom. The doorman quickly killed the roach and the maid with the mop just smiled. After the roach was died, they proceed to leave in a hurry. I stopped them and asked, \"Was this request normal?\" He looked at me and smiled and said \"Yes\". I was shocked! That \"yes\" made me uneasy through my whole trip. I hate ROACHES!!!! Moving on to the pool............Do not, I repeat....DO NOT order any drinks or food from the pool area. One, they are over priced and nasty in taste. The food was burnt (always) and place on the plate any kind of way and the drinks were sloppy. I sent everything back numerous times. I received mojitios with no rum or club soda or strawberry daiquiris melted. When I returned the drinks for anothers, I received major attitude from the pool bartender. Plus, our pool waiter, Ricardo, was slow and messed up our order contently. It was so bad, I had to walk over several time to place or fix my own orders. The one thing that saved my drink nightmare was Christopher. He was the bartender in the main lobby. He made the best passion fruit mojitio I ever had. Not drinking at the pool sucked, but he made up for it! Overall, one bartender could not save this hotel or my experience. The Conrad name should be stripped from the building. There is no class or luxury going on at this hotel. I am very shocked and disappointed that the Hilton brand continues to allow this hotel to operate in this manner.

Traveled in late July 2011 (stayed Monday - Friday). Although we normally travel All-inclusive (\"AI\"), since my wife if pregnant we decided to try this hotel out. Figured that Puerto Rico for a non-AI was the right choice for us this trip as we probably woudn't have gotten our money's worth if we had booked an AI resort in the DR or Jamaica, which we usually frequent for our vacations. The Conrad is about a 12 minute drive to the San Juan airport and cab is exactly $16 plus $1 for each piece of luggage so basically a twenty-dollar bill will get you to hotel (includes tip to cabbie). Hotel is nothing spectacular to look at if you are used to the typically AI resorts in let's say Punta Cana, but you have to realize that this is a hotel, not a resort, that is located in San Juan, a bustling metropolis - not the countryside or jungle. Hotel itself is located direclty on the ocean, which is beautiful. Just so you are aware, the hotel has two distinct buildings, separated by a main street. On one side of the street is the newer Conrad that is on the ocean. This is where you want to stay as this is where the two pools are located (one salt water - 6 ft depth throughout so not for children, one fresh water w/ pool bar, music, volleyball net and waterslide (very fun, even for adults! - for real). On the other side of the street is the older Conrad so no ocean views to be had. This is the hotel that has they gym (not too bad at all) and a small lap pool w/ jacuzzi. This also has a great steak restaurant on the 1st floor, which I highly recommend (great sliders!!). Anyway, The ocean-view side is where we stayed - 7th floor. View from room was fantastic, overlooking the open ocean in all directions from our balcony. Room itself if very nice and modern...you won't be disappointed if you get a room like we had. There is a few restaurants in this part of the hotel for a quick bite....sandwhiches aren't on the cheap side and average around $14. Luch for two ran about $35 w/ tip. Not too bad. If you are looking for cheaper options, there are plenty of avenues for you as this hotel is located in the city w/ plenty of Subways, Pizza Places, etc.....You just have to walk about 5-10 minutes down the street to get to multiple venues and restaurants. We hit up Walgreens the first day to load up on both waters, soda's and snacks for the pool. Found this to be really cost effective as there are refridgerators in each room. Also hit up the local liquor store for a case of Medalla Light (the Puerto Rico version of Bud Light)...not too bad. Spending $23 on a case is a better cost option of buying singles at the pool bar for $3.50/each - so $5 w/ tip. No brainer! We spent a lot of time at the pool w/ the pool bar. Never had a problem getting a seat...pick of the litter as we stayed mid-week. We found this to be much different than an AI resort as the European vacationers tend to wake up at like 3 AM to throw their towel on a prime-time lounge chair to reserve. BTW, there are NO European vacationers in Puerto Rico...so all Americans and locals here. Beach is located on a protected lagoon area.....nothing to brag about here as I think it may even be public? Water was warm and there are a few reefs to snorkle on but I would stay in the pool area as it felt more like vacation to me. The hotel has a 24 hour casino which was a good time. Slot machines do not pay out a damn thang but still fun playing penny and nickle slots. Never saw anyone hit at all and I was there a good amount of time. There are free drinks in the casino (not just alcoholic) - so if you are thirstly during the day, go to the back of the casino and there is a soda fountain w/ Coke/Sprite/Water, etc.....on the house yo! I pulled a few 2 AM runs down there when I was thirsty......no problem. Anyway, for excursions, we didn't really do any this time but we did trek into Old San Juan just to see it. Taxi is $16 to/from and it only is like 2 miles away - probalby too long to walk though due to humidity. Nothing really to brag about there....kind of dirty w/ souvenier shops every other door. I guess there are a couple of old Spanish forts if that is your thing. Ten minutes after walking around and looking at a few cobblestone streets, we were ready to go back to our area, which is much nicer. As for food, I do have to highly recommend one restaurant located not even a 3 minute walk from hotel. Think it's called Ropa Viejo or something like that. Great steak house. Actually, to be honest, one of the best steaks I've ever had - think it the \"Skirt Steak w/ Puerto Rico Spices\"...second to bottom item on the far right page of menu. Check-check it out..you won't be disappointed.....went well with the Jack & Coke's I was drinking. Well, to sum up my experience, it was a good trip for the amount of time we stayed there - 4 nights. Probably wouldn't have stayed longer here. Have to give a shout out to the hotel's concierge Leah Rossi. She is an absolute professional that strides to make her guests' hotel experience one to remember. I dropped her an email prior to arriving at her hotel and she hooked us up w/ a few hotel vouchers which was much appreciated and served to make our Conrad experience all the more memorable and affordable. Leah, if you by chance read this review, I thank you for your kindness. Well, enjoy your vacation. Never take bad reviews serious as you are the one who utlimately makes your vacation experience what it is. Wish I had more information to provide, but what it comes down to is that for 5 days, I pretty much pooled it, gambled it, slept it and ate it. Happy travels. O'Doyle Rules! San Dimas High School Football Rules! Now, it's time to enter into this parent thing in 3 months......good times. Hope my boy will travel the world like his dad!

From a business perspective, it has the basics - WiFi, copiers, fax machines and the like. It also works well for those of us who work late hours when out of town, since it has room service and multiple restaurants in house, so you can come in after a long day of work and stay at the hotel for the rest of the evening. I thought the room service menu was limited, but all you have to do is go down to the mezzanine to find multiple restaurants. There are a handful of decent restaurants close by, but only a few that I would consider \"walking distance\". Otherwise, you'll need to get in the car and make a short drive. Similarly, from a sightseeing perspective, the Condado is convenient, if only for the fact that it is not far from old San Juan. However, if you like to mix your business travel with sightseeing, I'd try to get something a little closer to old San Juan, if only for the fact that you can then get out and about directly from the hotel in the evenings. There is a smallish casino on site, where you can spend some time, if that's the sort of thing that interests you. All in all, the Condado is not a bad hotel, it's just not a great hotel. It fits the bill and gives you what you need in a hotel, with a little added convenience. If you want a comfortable bed, a decent room, and not much else, the Condado works just fine. The decor seems a little jarring in the lobby, but most of us don't spend hours/days in the lobby - so, in my opinion, no harm, no foul. As far as business travel goes, no complaints. If I were traveling for pleasure, however, I would be looking enviously at the sandy beaches across the bay at the Caribe Hilton or wishing I were in old San Juan.", "Date": "July 28, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Service": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "Atlanta, Georgia", "Title": "\u201chorrible customer service\u201d", "Author": "n54335i", "ReviewID": "UR115875286", "Content": "Need I say more.

On this visit, there was just one person working the front desk and a line for check in at midnight. It took 15 minutes because no one ever came to help out despite the line. The casino was packed and loud (I saw/heard it from the elevator on the way to my room). I may have just been unlucky in my room assignment, but the room next door and across the hall from me were hosting parties and the screaming both from the rooms and up and down the hall was constant. There seemed to constantly be people coming and going, and my guess was that people were alternating their time between the bar/casino and the rooms I was unfortunate enough to be near. I finally plugged my ears with my Ipod and headphones after being jarred awake several times by the yelling. The room itself was nice - oceanfront with a beautiful view. It was a nice size, with contemporary funishings, a desk and a couch. The bathroom was large with a rain showerhead. A more substantial room door that actually was flush with the ground might have helped with the noise from the hall and the room across. For Hilton Diamond status, I was given a voucher for a continental breakfast, which entitled me to coffee or hot tea (soda or cold tea were not allowed), juice, and toast or a muffin. Seemed a weak perk for elite status. The gentleman sitting next to me at breakfast had a voucher for the All American breakfast (hot) which apparently was part of his room rate, so obviously the same vouchers could be given for elite status, but apparently are not. I have stayed at the Caribe Hilton (all three buildings), the Marriott, and the Ritz. The Hilton is hit or miss depending on which building you get so I was avoiding that with this stay. The Ritz is off the beaten path as I remember, but nice. The Marriott was fine the one time I stayed there, and I will probably return there for my next visit.

Our household goods and vehicle were not due to arrive for a month so we have to stay in a hotel. I'm currently still here for four more days, I've been a \"resident\" of this hotel since June 3rd. This hotel is not accomodating, they lie and are rude. First problem we had: we did not know our military discount was for a suite, they had us in a small room for two weeks. When we asked for a microwave the lady at the front asked why we chose the smaller room, huh? So she put us in a suite bc weeks without a microwave and the waste of food was getting awful. They put us in a suite without a microwave and said oh, well we are sorry but no microwaves are available and we can't take them out of rooms and put them in yours, still we don't have a microwave. Second, our a/c doesn't work well on 80 it feels like 70, you have to turn it off to get warm then everything collects dew from the moisture and your fruit spoils quickly, oh nothing they can do. Third there is no cheap laundry for long term stay. Fourth I was expecting a package and after telling them they still held the package for three days and luckily my husband went down there and asked and then they handed it over. Fifth: at the cafe here all 6 times they messed up our food order and 3 times overcharged us. Sixth: everytime we had to extend our stay one of the front desk people said oh we can't do this until you check out and my husband said I'll be gone just my wife is here and I have the money then a few hours later we asked someone else and they were like let's take care of it now. Seventh: every week at odd times our keys randomly stop working. Eighth: my husband was underway and I got back to the hotel and the hallway and my room smelt like pot smoke and loud music was next door, my head was throbbing. I called the front desk, they said they'd send security which they never did and this went on all night, at this point we didn't check out bc changing paperwork through the military was hassle. Ninth: the parking garage is for guest and public so when I did get my car the lot was full and I had to park a few blocks away and by myself at night walk in puerto rico. Tenth: when I got parking in the garage my car was broken into AND THE HOTEL SAID THEY AREN'T LIABLE!!!!! My door locks no longer work so I have to climb through my back hatch to unlock the doors in my SUV....lastly three days before we check out the hotel calls and says our credit card is maxed out, they've been running it without our permission when that is the card on hold and we've been paying debit. The card only has a 3,000$ limit. I asked how are you able to decide how to pay my expenses? They said the balance has to be paid every seven days and I said that's funny bc this is the first I'm hearing of this and we've been paying every two to three weeks and she through out their scapegoat of POLICY. They all don't follow the same allusive policy....I cannot wait to get out of this greedy hotel and if one more time they tell me \"your husband being in the military doesn't matter we can't wait for him to get back\" I'm going to lose it....guard your own coast then conrad!!!!!", "Date": "July 26, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "2", "Sleep Quality": "2", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Service": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "Killeen, Texas", "Title": "\u201cHorrible service, items stolen,phone didn't work....don't waste your $$!!!\u201d", "Author": "MMO698", "ReviewID": "UR115768632", "Content": "We booked this hotel as a package deal 6 months earlier...

I was slightly surprised since I was expecting the major strip to look like miami's south beach but it doesn't it. The hotel is a weathered area but we still didn't seem to mind since everything was just a short walk. Only a 5-10 min walk to the nearby populated beach and eateries. People frequently go running during all times of the day on the strip next to the hotel. The strip was very safe. Saw plenty of people walking at night. Took the bus to Old San Juan in the afternoon. Felt very safe with my husband. Ate at Cafe PR! Excellent choice...try the stuffed eggplant. Ate also at Raices, great rican food here too. If you like to dance check out Latin Grooves on a Friday or Saturday night in Old San Juan. Visit the Fort and the San Juan Museum. Be sure to reserve your rental car online at Enterprise...which is also onsite beside the hotel. Better price when reserved online cause price is super high once you get there. Drove to Camuy to see the CAVES and El Yunque (the rain forest and water fall) is a must if you do nothing else. When also went to the Bio Bay out in Farjardo.

I'd actually originally booked the Hilton Caribe which is across the bay from the Conrad. I was disappointed with the customer service and cleanliness at the Hilton Caribe. So I booked the Conrad, which is about 5 minutes away from the Hilton Caribe and is also a Hilton property. I found the staff at this hotel to be a lot more helpful. One of the managers really scrambled at the last minute to find us a room after we told him about our issues at the Hilton Caribe. This hotel is also less chaotic than the Hilton Caribe. Overall the rooms here are pretty good. The hotel strives to have a hip vibe and features a modern decor. The bathrooms in the rooms are large; there are no tubs, but I never take sit down baths at hotels anyway. My only complaint about the room would be the lack of storage, small safe, are they do show their age a bit. I would say both the Hilton Caribe and Conrad are worn. The Conrad simply does a better job of hiding it's age because of the superior housekeeping staff. You definitely see the signs of wear on the hotel exterior. From an amenities perspective there is a small beach, a pool with a slide, and a small salt water pool. The grounds are not large. If you're looking for big grounds and lots for the kids to do, then stay at the Hilton Caribe (if you can brave the crowds and inferior service). If you want a more laid-back vibe, then the Conrad is a better choice. The Conrad also features a Casino and two tennis courts. We only ate once at the hotel - AND ONCE WAS ENOUGH! We made the mistake of eating a Cafe Caribe. Probably some of the worst food and slowest service I've ever had at a restaurant! To add insult to injury, the food was not cheap. My paella tasted like dishwater and it cost $24. I'm not sure about the other restaurants at the hotel, but definitely don't eat at the Cafe Caribe. The hotel Starbucks was a great resource.

We took the bus a few times which was also very convenient as it was located right in front of the hotel and it was 75 cents each way to OSJ. The hotel itself was also enjoyable. I really enjoyed the pool area.. a salt water pool, a hot tub and a regular pool with a swim up bar. The service at the pool and swim up bar was great. The also had lots of lounge chairs and hammocks. The beach was nice but if you are looking to be on the beach a lot and don't care about a pool I may look elsewhere as it was small. But it did offer a nice reef for snorkeling and tropical fish to see. Our room was nice. I enjoyed the balcony. The bathroom was tiny so if you care about bathroom size you may want to upgrade to a larger room. Staff was friendly we asked the concierge for things a few times and they were always very helpful. Overall I thought it was a nice place to stay for the money we paid.

Just steps away from the pools is the beach where you can swim and snorkel. I brought my snorkel equipment and spent time snokeling where I saw some amazing fish (just wish I had brought my daughters waterproof camera.). There are two buildings to the Conrad. Across the street there is the Condado lagoon, where you can rent Kayaks and stand-up boards. Also the gym is in this building. The gym is large with updated equipment and everything you need for a great workout. There is also a whirlpool in the gym! The casino has great entertainment at night with a live band to keep you dancing while your gambling. (I'm not much of a gambler but my husband enjoyed the casino). The Condado area is beautiful and upscale and the Conrad is (in my opinion) the best location with views of the ocean, city ,and lagoon. You can walk places to eat in the Condado area (which is a good idea to walk off all the good food you will eat). The bus stop is right in front of the resort and for 75 cents you can go to Old San Juan for some sight-seeing and shopping.

The shopping near the hotel is convenient as there are various souvenir shops, a subway, and a walgreens. Most of the other shops were very high end though, but still fun to window shop. There are several authentic restaurants nearby including, ropa vieja and San angel. These two offered delicious puerto rican meals. We also tried pikayo in the hotel. Make sure to make reservations and request a table by the window. The food was delicious but very pricey. It made a great night to dress up and have a romantic dinner though.

Well, it's on the pricey side, a bottle of fiji water was $7 and don't forget to turn in your towels in the pool/beach area because they will charge $20 for each towel and the restaurants were at least $30 per dish and parking was $16 for self or $21 for valet. We like to splurge when on vacation but it can quickly add up. You could clearly see some wear and tear in many areas of the building/rooms.

I did a ton of research on Trip Advisor and booked a great deal through CheapCarribean.com for hotel and air. We rented a car (Priceline) which we used almost 300 miles on. This area of PR had the most going on as far as restaurants, bars, shopping and beaches. My only complaint would be the bathrooms. Although they were very modern, they didn't offer alot of privacy. One other note, I like to wake up to a dark room and the curtains did not meet the floor nor close all the way in the middle. The pool had a good vibe and was never so crowded that you couldn't find a seat. They had beachtowels for you that you could check out. The hot tub was never really crowded either. The self parking was very accessible and convenient. Some of the restaurants (walking distance) we tried were at La Concha Hotel- Voga Italian Grill- Excellent Service and Delicious Food! Perurrican- Best ceviche and mofongo! Latin Star- we ate here twice for breakfast for $12/day! Garrachino's - Have to go here since they are the inventor of the Pina Colada. Also, the hotel bar would get pretty happening late at night and they had the best sangria! I would recommend reserving your spots a few days early for the excursions. You can get names and phone numbers of all the companies from one of the PR magazines they have in the hotel room. We did the bioluminescent kayak tour thru Yokahukayaks ($45 pp) and I would recommend the 6PM tour so you can see where you're going! We also drove Las Palmas Resort for horseback riding thru Rancho Bueno Vista. Loquillo kiosks for lunch although they all had the same food. But we ate lunch and had 2 beers for $7! The rainforest was cool too. Plan a whole day for that and you can bring a cooler and have lunch there. It was hot so definitely wear a bathing suit to get in the water and tennis shoes! For our dancing night we took a taxi to Club Brava. Dress to kill and a $20 cover for men. Old San Juan was a great day trip of shopping and bar hopping. After seeing several hotels, this one has the most going on around it and lots of activities to walk to whereas the others had nothing around them. Granted the beach was small and we would drive to other beaches, I like having access to good restaurants and a Walgreens for those last minute items.

I stayed at the hotel for Memorial Weekend. I had the pleasure of having an ocean front room with a balcony on the 9th floor. The rooms have been completely remodeled. The room was very clean, maid service was good, and I ordered food to my room without any problems. It can be pricey to order room service but all the hotels are pricey when it comes to room service. The Hotel has two pools and an awsome gym that I used. The casino was fun as well the restaurants inside the hotel. I had breakfast there every morning and it was ok. The noodle Bar had an awsome Lo Mein dish that I enjoyed very much. f you don't mind leaving the hotel check out the other restaurants in the area. I know Puerto Rico well, especially the Condado area so I walked around and ate at various restaurants on Ashofrd Avenue during my visit.. There is a nice Cuban restaurant down the street and down by the Raddison Hotel there is a decent Puerto Rican Bar/Restaurant that had a band playing music. I did not rent a car this time so i took the bus into Old San Juan for the day. It;s well worth it for 75 cents. The bus stop is right out in front of the Hotel and I believe it is the number 21 bus to Old San Juan. It drops you off at the bus terminal and then you can walk up the hill to the various restaurants. stores and fort at the top. It can be very hot and humid so carry and drink plenty of water. You take the bus back to the hotel from the bus terminal. My only complaint was that I was unable to check into the hotel until 4pm. I arrived at 2pm and had to wait for a room to be available. I did see a number of people get checked in while I had to wait for a room that was prepaid for. Anyway, I checked my luggage and walked around the property, gambled, and had lunch before checking into the room at 4pm. The hotel was full with travelers and there was a political convention at the hotel while I was there. It was very enjoyable and not noisy outside in front of the hotel. If your looking for more than relaxation you should stay at the Marriott, La Cocha or Raddison Hotel at the other end of Ashford Avenue.

We arrived at Condado Plaza on a Friday night. After checking in we went up to our room which was a King Superior Room with an Ocean View. The room was very large and spacious with an amazing view and bathroom. However, it took us about 20 minutes to get to the rooms because the elevators were horrid and moved soooooo slow. Had there been stairs, I would have walked up the 7 floors in a heart beat. Anyway, the rooms were nice, very plushly furnished with a great color scheme. The walls are very thin however. I know this because the screaming baby in the room next door was extremely audible and kept me up the first night. All day Saturday my BF and I walked around Old San Juan and did some shopping and eating. Tons of fun. We get back to the room after being gone approximately 8 hours and the room is not serviced. Nothing has been done. Not a single thing. Well, for what I was paying a night - I was not OK with the room being in the same condition as when we left that morning. So i called housekeeping and told them about it. The first words out of the woman's mouth were \"Well did you leave the Do Not Disturb sign on the door?!\" Uh no - wish I could have. We didn't even have a sign to leave on the door. After complaining to housekeeping they sent someone up with approximately 2 clean towels and some coffee creamer and that was it. I was not pleased but decided to brush it off and try to enjoy the rest of the trip. Everything was fine until I was getting ready to checkout and I realized that my Kindle (e-book reader) was missing as was a camera case for my video camera. I searched all through all of my checked luggage and through every square inch of the room and the items were no where to be found. When I reported this to security they asked if I was sure I checked everywhere and if I had ever taken the items out of the room (NO - don't you think I already thought of this). Finally, their \"investigation\" was they took down my statement and said they would call me if they find anything. I still havent heard a peep and when I call the hotel to talk to security I either get hung up on or they are \"still investigating.\" I have been staying at Hilton hotels my entire life.

My other reviews indicate some great stays at Hilton brands. But would think twice before staying at this particular Hilton hotel. While the room and hotel were generally, very nice (with a few exceptions noted below), the bait-and-switch regarding what was included in their $42.50/nite \"resort fee\" (the pool, the casino!) make this a property to avoid or at least carefully consider. First, the room(s, plural as several folks from our company stayed here for a meeting): Beds are super comfy; shower is great; pool complex is impressive; and the restaurants deliver good value. Biggest negative was that the blackout curtain in my oceanside room didn't extend to floor, and with no daylight savings time, it gets light early. Also, the hallway was quite loud because I don't think the bottom of the doors meshed well with the carpet. Decor in lobbies is pretty sterile and dated, but there are many features that come with a full-service hotel. All this comes at a cost of course and the somewhat ubiquitous Resort Fee has become an underhanded revenue generator for a lot of hotels. At this property, like most Hilton's, room rates are highly variable based on room choice, discount code (e.g., AAA), date of booking, and whether one chooses one of their special packages. My big complaint, the reason for 3*'s (vs. 5), and the reason why I would never return is the underhanded and incredibly overpriced telephone charges for long distance on top of the resort fee (which includes free local calls and toll-free access from the rooms, and faxes from the business center). Shame on me, for not knowing, much less agreeing to pay $198 for 13 long-distance calls that lasted a total of 57 minutes, but this is 2011 when phone calls are LESS expensive than they were in 1980, right? Remember Puerto Rico is part of the United States, and while one might have to pay a $.69/min roaming charge or $.15/minute on a calling card, there is absolutely no justification for charging $9.60 for a one-minute phone call. We're in a major city not on a cruise ship . . . My bottom-line complaint is that these phone charges were not an effort by a hotel to recover costs, plus a fair profit, for a provided service -- this is a poorly communicated way to gouge their customers. I would suggest others stay clear. {Final disclosure -- after I communicated my disappointment to the hotel, they cut 25% off the phone charges. Resulting in a final charge of $149 for 13 separate phone calls that lasted a total of 57 minutes.

A friend of ours recommended we stay either here at the Conrad or at La Cocha. After researching both, the Conrad was more reasonably priced so we thought we'd check it out. First, the location was ideal for us. It's located in popular Condado on Ashford Ave. It's very walkable to restaurants and shopping without taking a taxi which is nice. It's also a very short cab ride to Old San Juan, since it's at the end of Ashford you don't have to sit in traffic in a cab getting to the bridge to get into Old San Juan. It was around $14 via cab to get anywhere in the old city. The Condado beach is right on the property. It's not huge but does the trip, especially considering the location and that you're right in the city. They have a great reef right there and we saw all sorts of fish..very cool. There are chairs, towels and umbrellas for hotel guests to use. The property itself is great. Very clean, modern and fresh. The views are gorgeous with the waves crashing against the rambling rock walls that surround the waterfront of the hotel. The grounds are well manicured with seating at the pool, beach, along the rock walls, and the expansive porch...all alongside the ocean. They even had a few hammocks up that we could relax in for a bit. They have pool side service which we found very nice. They have rentals for beach activities right on-site if you're interested. Our room was great. We had a deluxe ocean room....and the view did not disappoint. Often times \"ocean view\" rooms are a standard hotel room with a balcony. I loved that the bed actually faced the glass wall/deck. You actually laid in bed and saw all ocean....that's what i'm talking about! The bed was very comfortable and the bathroom was very cool as well......marble top vanity, rimless shower, great toiletries, coffee maker, and fridge. Not sure if our floor was empty or if we got lucky but it was very quiet too. For a hotel with a casino in it we had a lot of privacy. The staff were all very friendly and attentive. They open doors, answer questions and were very helpful. I'd recommend this hotel for those looking for a quiet getaway in the city OR those looking for a wilder trip.

We settled on the Conrad because it seemed to be a great location with all of the resort amenities we'd want, wrapped in a beautiful 4 star hotel. The result: we didn't hate it... but we were disapointed and didn't feel that it totally lived up to the pictures or measured up to a 4 star status. Cons: -The beach isn't good. It's small, public and faces a sheltered little body of water between the open sea and the lagoon... and also looks out on an unattractive causeway that leads to Old San Juan. To sit on a real beach with real Atlantic surf, we had to walk down to La Concha hotel a few blocks down on the Condado strip (a great beach, btw, that you can get chairs and umbrellas at and get waited on). -The weekday service at the pools was lacking... no one came around to take drink or food orders and when we went to the bar/grill in the pool area to order up some grub it took a long time to get delivered to our chairs and was cold/melted (and super overpriced, of course). The main pool with the bar was dirty. It was just kind of a ghost town. This all improved over the weekend... but it shouldn't take a Saturday to make the hotel present itself better. -Yes, it was \"recently rennovated\"... but there's still a very very worn look to a large chunk of the hotel. Not exactly the cleanest and crispest. Worn rugs, walls in need of paint, outdated and/or worn furniture. -Our bedroom and bathroom were SO dark when the sun wasn't out! Not enough lighting at all. And the shower, toilet, sink, closet are in one contained space off of the main room... not ideal for a room that's not being shared by a couple. Pros: -the beds were very comfy and the rooms were modern and clean -all of the rooms have balconies and even if you go for a cheaper lagoon facing room vs. an ocean view room (as we did), it's a nice scene to take in -Being on the Condado strip is ideal... as earlier stated, I just think it's better to be farther down the street, on a real beach and not right next to the causeway. -it covered the basics well enough and was still in a really beautiful spot... just not what we wanted from a $300 a night 4 star joint", "Date": "April 20, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "1", "Location": "3", "Rooms": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cFind somewhere else to stay\u201d", "Author": "Chi_jcw", "ReviewID": "UR104357391", "Content": "We stayed at the Conrad prior to boarding out ship for a seven night cruise.

Then the IT manager at the hotel called us to make sure that the internet in the new room was working fine.

There are interesting chairs, art pieces, aquariums, light fixtures or other decorative elements everywhere. The decor gives the hotel a different, non-cookie cutter vibe that almost makes you forget how large it is. The hotel is really two building across the street from each other, connected by a breezeway. In general the place seemed to be clean and well-maintained; I didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t experience the elevator issues mentioned by other reviewers. Our room was in the lagoon view building. Overall the room was fine. It was large and clean and the AC, fridge, TV, etc all were in good working order. The bed was comfortable and the linens were good quality. The bathroom door had a frosted glass panel that was easy to see through and didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t provide much privacy. There was also a nice sized balcony with chairs and a table overlooking the lagoon and the roof of the hotel facilities below. The only thing about the room that I didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t like was the tile floor; it was cold and seemed to make it a little loud, but definitely cleaner alternative than carpet. The grounds of the hotel were beautiful! There were lots of places to explore and we discovered a new area of the property every day. There are nicely furnished porches and patios all over. There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a lawn overlooking the ocean with hammocks to relax in. The large pool has a swim-up bar and a waterslide with \u00e2\u20ac\u0153beach\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd access just a few steps away. There is also a hot-tub and another pool in this area. All of this is on the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153beach\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd side of the hotel. The lagoon side also had a small pool. A great thing about this hotel was that it has a casino. A real casino, not the kind of casino you might find at a hotel in the Dominican Republic. The sushi bar/Chinese restaurant just outside of the casino had great food and was open very late (until 3 or 4am). Now let me just say this: THIS HOTEL DOES NOT HAVE A REAL BEACH! The hotel is located at the end of the strip of stores, restaurants and hotels in Condado. The property is on the ocean it just doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have a typical beachfront. There are mostly walled off areas that prevent you from going onto the rocks where the property meets the ocean. The sandy area on the property is very, very small and crowded and not really on the ocean (no waves). It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s worth a walkthrough I guess. The real beach is just a five minute walk from the hotel and it is beautiful!

We are frequent beach travelers, mostly to the SW Florida coast, but wanted something new this year. We were excited about staying at a Conrad and the value of the \"family suite\" which was offered. We were excited about the pools and beach and looked forward to a great urban resort vacation. While we were pleased with our choice to chose Puerto Rico for seven nights, we probably wouldn't chose the Conrad again so long as we were traveling with our son. The family suite is really just a glorified Embassy Suites room, with the twin beds in place of the living quarters at an Embassy Suites. The galley kitchen was workable, but had no sink, so you were constantly running into the bathroom while using the kitchen. The bathroom did not have a bath tub. Kind of a big deal for a two and half year old who has never had to shower at bath time. There were was no way to dry our swim suits like in most beach resorts. The family suite is also located in the Lagoon Tower and has a city view. If you've never been to PR, you'll quickly learn that drivers really like their horns. A city view, which is set back only a few feet from a busy city street is therefore quite loud at all times of day with horns and car noise. Casino is small (and the craps table was very quiet on Saturday night). On the positive side: The main pool is great. Our son loved it. He enjoyed the water slide and the fountains. They had two other pools (a salt water pool and a small pool on the Lagoon side) which we didn't use. Towel Service is great, but they are serious about returning towels (they tried to charge us for towels we allegedly didn't return on the first day). The small beach area is small, but provides a great area for a small child to wade in the water without the crashing waves. The ocean floor is very course with shells/rocks, but our son enjoyed it nonetheless. We had a small problem with housekeeping wanting to clean our room during our son's nap time on the first day. We communicated the problem to housekeeping and they were AWESOME the rest of the trip. We had a good meal in the Cafe Caribee the first night. Workout facility was awesome, well cared for and pretty well used, without being crowded. We used every day. Free WiFi was reliable and very strong signal.

We ate there every morning for breakfast but ate at the local restaurants down the strip for lunch and dinner. Yes there are a couple of abandoned buildings along the strip near the hotel but it isn't the Conrad's fault, how can you fault them for that? Concierge was helpful and our room was clean. Housekeeping kept our towels and toiletries stocked and bed made. Check in didn't take long. I'm not sure why some people experienced check-in problems, maybe because they booked through other agents i.e. orbits, hotels.com, hotwire. I booked directly through condadoplaza.com and received a good vacation package (the same as or maybe a little cheaper than the other sites). I had a lagoon view room in which the lagoon view was beautiful and the lagoon tower was very quiet. The bathrooms are tight (contemporary and nice but small) and the bathroom doors slide open and closed, and the bathrooms have stand in showers which is very practical and you can hear the \"business\" of anyone who is in the bathroom which shouldn't be a problem if you are with your significant other. We walked the strip a lot to eat at the local restaurants which are very good and cheaper than the hotel restaurants. We walked down to Cartier, Gucci, car rental (because the hotel rental cars were booked), souvenier shops, local restaurants, etc. We felt safe in the area and I even walked down the strip and back to a souvenier shop alone our last morning there and I had no problems. A bus stop is directly in front of the hotel. For 75 cents you can take the bus to Old San Juan and walk around and do whatever you please instead of paying $50 plus for the tour. We visited El Yunque rainforest, Bacardi, and Old San Juan. We didn't get a chance to visit Plaza las Americas and the hotel beach. We rented a car to go to the rainforest 45 minutes away and it was beautiful. If you are a scary or slow driver please do not drive! The locals drive very fast and aggressive. Almost every car we saw had a dent in it except for luxury cars. Keep in mind that all of Puerto Rico doesn't look like a resort, you cannot expect it to. We had no problem with anyone on the whole island speaking and understanding English (we had to stop at Rite Aid after leaving the rainforest-a long way away from the resort areas). My boyfriend even got mistaken for being Puerto Rican a couple of times and a couple of people came up to him speaking Spanish until they noticed that he and I were black and they effortlessly switched over to English. We wish we could have stayed longer because we didn't get to do all the things we wanted to do in Puerto Rico. All in all we had a wonderful trip and felt welcome everywhere we went.

Pikayo restaurant is an ABSOLUTE MUST for foodies as well as Marmalade (Beautiful room, wonderful knowlgable waitstaff) We had the 4 course Chef's Tasting which was truly entertaining and imaginative. We're still talking about the white bean soup served in a demitasse cup and the Chef came out several times to inquire about our meal and share some \"culinary secrets\" with us.The St. Germaine on the corner of Calle De La Cruz is a wonderful respite from the heat and crowds in Old San Juan (their fresh Ginger Margarita is delicious and their rum cake with butter cream amaretto icing is \"to die for\"!!) and it has a very friendly, funky euro feel. Too bad we didn't have enough time to go back for dinner (next visit definitely) The weather was gorgeous every day (despite Weather channel's predictions). I agree about the small \"beach\" area and the traffic on the bridge yada yada, however, there' s good snorkeling and warm water off that beach and it has a genuine cultural/local vibe. There's a guy with a Bar-b-que set up offering sausage, hamburgers and chicken shish kabob for sale and the \"Icee Man\" walking around, ringing his bell selling shaved ice with cherry, lemon or lime syrup. Great stuff! Bottom line on food: MUST GO to (1) Jose Enrique in Santurce. Amazing experience! Their signature dish, Deep Fried Whole snapper is something you will never forget. The presentation alone will put a big smile on your face, coupled with the Chocolate Trio for dessert will make the trip to this neighborhood fantastic eatery well worth the cab ride. Go on a Thursday or Friday night and enjoy the outdoor \"party\" around the Plaza del Mercado (2) Pikayo (3) Ropa Vieja -order the beef w vegetable soup, shrimp w garlic sauce (you'll need xtra bread :) Martini was a good deal at 10.00 and the Entree portions are enough to share", "Date": "March 23, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "michigan", "Title": "\u201cMy Favorite Hotel\u201d", "Author": "hobiecatsailor", "ReviewID": "UR101051082", "Content": "Last week I stayed at the Conrad San Juan for the 5th time.

Beginning from the moment we walked into the Conrad San Juan Condado Plaza, the staff was friendly, helpful, and accommodating the entire trip. Since we had little time to plan before our vacation, we relied on the concierge to direct us in the right direction. Marisol, who works as a concierge, went over and beyond by researching flights and options for a way to get us to the nearby island of Culebra (which I recommend you plan before your trip). She made herself available after hours and even provided me with her personal number just in case I had questions. This meant a lot to me since this was our first time in Puerto Rico. Needless to say, (with the help from the others like Christina and Emmanuel) our week schedule was full from the time we woke up till the time we were ready to sleep in our rooms\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 comfy beds. The rooms were modernly decorated with bright orange and red, the bathrooms spacious, strong water pressure, and included all the little extras we needed (iron, blow dryer, etc). Thanks to the staff, we made time for some of the best tours (ex. El Yunque, Snorkeling, Bacardi) the island had to offer as well as eat at some of Puerto Rico\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s most popular restaurants (ex. Raices & Ropa Vieja) for dinner. Since the package we purchased from the hotel included delicious breakfast with a beautiful view at Caf\u00c3\u00a9 Caribe, we didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have to worry about leaving the hotel and then returning to try and make our tour departures. On our last day we finally had an opportunity to relax at our hotel, well besides the tasty passion fruit drinks we enjoyed at Aqua Bar prior to our evenings out every night and the short time we spent at the somewhat disappointing smaller than expected casino (tried not to compare it to Las Vegas). What were we thinking waiting so long? We had a great time by the pool and jacuzzi, Caesar made sure we had everything we needed, and Michael from security helped us complete our experience in San Juan by sharing the history, places we still needed to see, and where we needed to go on our last night on the island. After following his advice, I think we need to come back and soon. We were so tempted to miss our flight but came to our senses and decided to plan another trip for later this year instead.

The pool on the ocean side was bustling and a bit busy for my taste, however, for that quiet retreat the lagoon pool was just perfect. The only downside to the lagoon bar is that the bar was not open and there was no wait staff. The ocean side pools were serviced by the Aqua Bar and our bartender Dave kept the drinks coming...just be careful he will keep giving them to you and then a BIG BILL...but he was great!! Our room was well appointed if not a little small. We looked out onto the part of the lagoon that extends past the bridge...more on that in a sec...but was very beautiful. The bathroom was basically for one person only unless the other was in the shower, but it was done well. OK now for the but...the beach is really small and sits on the lagoon...this is perfect if you have kids and dont want to worry too much about the waves as they are minimal, however the beach looks out with a noisy bridge on your left(very close) and the Hilton Carribe on the other and the ocean to your right. If a beach vacation is what you seek, look elsewhere. This is not the resort for just the sound of the ocean, the sand between your toes, and the wind in your hair. Not that you dont get that but you also get the honking taxi steps away and the smell of the cars sitting in traffic on the bridge. All in all the hotel is beautiful and I'm fully enjoying my stay.

The land part of the trip was excellent and very memorable. Puerto Rico is fun, friendly, and a crazy, interesting mix of cultures. Before the cruise we stayed at the Conrad Condado Plaza hotel, within sight of the cruise ship port. This was an excellent location. We got a special price of $109 night on Hotwire and felt this hotel was a great value for the price and amenities. Arriving fairly late, around 9 PM, and the hotel being full we got a special unexpected benefit - although it took a while to find us an available room we got a free upgrade to a suite room, that was one of the largest and nicest we ever stayed in. The hotel pool and grounds were perfect for one of our days hanging out and the much better than average, fully equipped and well furnished fitness center was much appreciated for a good work out on out \"hotel\" day. The main breakfast eatery in the hotel has very good breakfast deals which we used both days. You can get an American style breakfast for under $10. In the evening there is a Subway sandwich shop, a pizza place, a small mini mart, and several higher priced restaurants withing a few blocks of easy waling - so you are not stuck with what the hotel has to offer. We also rented a car at the on site Enterprise car rental. Great service and prices by the Enterprise desk there. We were very glad we opted for the new Garmin Nuvi GPS. If you don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t know your way around, a GPS is pretty indispensable. In the San Juan area, however, we never could figure out how to get an exact address recognized by the GPA or get the GPs to find several places we wanted, but it did not get lost and saved us a lot of time and trouble. It also seemed it had the proper turns, but wrong street names several places in San Juan and that was not just translation problems - the street names given by the GPS were different but the turn directions were correct. Still it managed to get us around when we would have been totally lost oterhwise. After the cruise the Garmin GPS we used in southern Puerto Rico was pretty accurate on everything, but again we didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have much luck getting it to find some specific businesses and addresses. Housekeeping service was hit and miss even though we tipped $5 the first night - we cut that back to $2 and finally $3. Several times I had to track them down to get coffee or things they forgot to put in our room. Overall the service seemed as good as normal and the restaurant service in the hotel for breakfast was very good. I had read about a beach bicycle/walking trail and board walk at Pinones, near San Juan, in the Carolina area that had bicycle rentals. My wife and I like cycling. The GPS helped get us to Pinones and as described, as soon as you cross the bridge and on the down ramp, go right into the first parking lot and business area. Here your will find a building marked COPI that rents some old beater multi gear mountain bikes - good enough to have fun with. We rode for several hours along the trail, seeing beautiful beaches, shoreline and some inland swampy areas loaded with tiny crabs, making a very interesting and nice outing. You will be able to see much more by riding than walking and I recommend you use COPI or keep driving to find some other bike rentals that we saw signs for along the way, but you probably will not find any \u00e2\u20ac\u0153great\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd bikes. We also had lunch across the street from the COPI building before riding, at a popular hill top place, favored by locals, and good food and prices. After riding we enjoyed drinks at a local beach front bar overlooking the ocean and interesting reef and rock formations. The area seemed mostly used by locals and wasn't busy during a mid-week day. You could also takes towels and have some great beaching, wading or even snorkeling on beaches in that area after parking your car or taking the stuff with you as you bike or walk the trail.", "Date": "March 12, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "New Haven, CT", "Title": "\u201cBetter Late then Never\u201d", "Author": "Tamari0n", "ReviewID": "UR99715986", "Content": "kinda late posting my review, but i figured BETTER LATE THAN NEVER!!

My husband on the other hand it was a new experience for him as his first time there. We loved every day and every experience. The hotel is at its very best location. It is situated in a corner offering to their guests a private beach where they can relax in. For those that like waves or want to be more immersed in the culture this is the perfect place to stay. There are other beaches at walking distance. Me and my husband personally did beach hopping. We would visit the hotel beach and sometimes the same day go walking to \"el escanbron\" beach. This beach is only a 15 minute walk and besides being immersed in the culture it has everything. It has lifeguards,showers,restrooms, food, a spot to relax in the water and a spot popular for surfers. From the beach you can view the fort and old san juan, This was only a 15 minute walk from our hotel. On the opposite directions there are also other beaches along with shopping and restaurants. We did not have to rent a car due to the fact that we had every thing within walking distance. If we wanted to go to old san juan or any other surrounding areas it was mostly a 13$ cab fair. The hotel it self has 2 buildings. One facing the ocean and the other facing the lagoon. We stayed in the lagoon side and it was a perfect junior suite. The room was contemporary and comfortable. From one side of the room we can view the ocean and from the other we can view the lagoon. For those that like to do water sports there are many possibilities around the area. You can kayak in the lagoon,wind surfing, surfing, rents jet skis. The hotel was able to give us info on this. There is a beautiful part on the back of the hotel where you can enjoy a great nap in a hamac or just enjoy the sunrise. The hotel has a great staff. Every question we had they answered with a smile. I was very impressed with the cleanliness of the hotel, and how professional all the employees were. For those that enjoy the night life, there is a bar in the hotel along with a little night club. A casino and several restaurants are within the hotel. Also there are other hot spots in old san juan and Isla verde with in 10 minutes of a drive. Overall our stay was great and I would recommend staying there.

The rooms are nicely appointed, although the cleanliness of the rooms needs much improvement. The rooms/halls tend to be very noisy as the rooms all of tile floors which echos every time someone flushes the high-powered toilets or shuts their guest room door. The beds are comfy. The bathrooms are strange as the shower is in the middle of a large room that is shared with the fridge, open closet and other bathroom appointments. When you walk out the shower you need to be a little careful not to get all of your hanging clothes wet. The service at the hotel is awful. From the bell captain, to the front desk, to housekeeping - everyone seemed bothered here. Attitudes were high. Friendliness non existent. The only staff that seemed to be remotely interested in guests were the pool bar attendants. Other pool staff was totally uninterested.....beach chairs on the playita (little thing they call a beach) were delayed as the attendant was on his personal phone hiding behind the wall. Luggage took over an hour, after 3 calls, to be delivered to the room. The hotel location is in Condado, but at the very end. The hotel seems to be surrounded by vacated old and condemned buildings covered in grafitti. Such a shame. The area is safe, but just doesn't feel like a vacation or resort area. Anything interesting is at least a 10 minute walk away or a cab ride. Isla verde resorts have much more to offer, I feel, as this hotel doesn't have a real beach. The \"playita\" is blocked by rocks and in the inlet. Nothing compared to the Isla Verde beaches. The hotel does try to make up for this with two large pool areas.", "Date": "February 25, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "2", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "NJ USA", "Title": "\u201cGreat family suites!

We booked a city view \"family suite\" for our 4 night stay. The room was just what we were looking for! There were two twin beds upon entering the room, lots of storage space, a nice sized bathroom and a another private area with a king size bed. The room was mostly updated with the exception of a 70's ish wall papered wall in the king area. The room was clean and comfortable. There was also a balcony that over looked Ashford Ave and afforded views of the lagoon and street, no street noise with drapes closed. The room was in a bldg. across the street from the main hotel so there was a little walk to the pool and small public beach. Unfortunately, we were not aware that there were water sport facilities on that part of the property until the day we were leaving. It would have been nice if were we were told upon check in. We ate breakfast in the hotel each day as there are no other places in walking distance to the hotel that we could find that served breakfast. Warning! the food is just ok and is very expensive for the quality and the service provided. There was a wait each morning for a table and the service was so poor. In fact one morning the hostess refused to seat us because she had no tables for 3 only large tables available. When I asked her why we could not sit at one of the many empty \"big\" tables she said if \"some larger parties came she would have no place to put them.\" I told her that made no sense since there was no one waiting and that there were so many empty large tables. She dismissed my comments and walked away. When I complain to the front desk down stairs they immediately called and was given the same run around by the hostess, the desk clerk then called the manager. Needless to say we were seated right away. We had dinner one of the nights at the noodle place at the hotel which was so over priced it was a crime and to boot the food was not even good. We had much better luck dining out of the hotel although most places were a pretty good walk away. The pool at the hotel is very nice, get there early if its busy to find a seat . There are 3 pools. A kiddie pool tucked away near the street, main pool with a slide and pool bar and a sea water pool, which was very nice with views of the ocean. The hot tub was loaded with little children, not very enjoyable for teens and adults for that reason.The beach is small and not really an ocean beach, always seating there. Lots of noise on the beach from passing traffic and bridge construction. If you are looking for a full beach expereince this is not the place for you. I would recommend this hotel for a short stay as there is not much to do there other then the beach and pool. It is a $15.00 cab ride each way to Old San Juan and not much in walking distance to the hotel. A few decent places to eat in walking distance not much else. Area around the hotel is...not very pretty, except for the sea views, safe to walk around, lots of joggers and tourists walking at night.

Our room was red with black, which seemed odd and dark for a hotel on the beach. Despite our dislike of the decor, it was neat and clean and the bed was comfy. The bathroom was strangely designed with a glass shower in the middle that leaked. The best thing about the room was definitely the ocean view. Overall, the staff were very nice and pleasant.

It was small, like other reviewers have noted, with views of a bridge (with construction going on) and buildings across the inlet. Not great if you are hoping to enjoy a nice beach atmosphere.

Most of San Juan is beautiful, with warm, wonderful people and beaches to match. But this hotel is none of those things. We actually stayed at two hotels this trip, spending the first night (for free) at the pretentious-but-gorgeous Marriott La Concha down the street. If La Concha is a supermodel, the Conrad is her little sister. I was looking forward to moving to the Conrad, expecting a more down-to-earth experience. I got a little more than I bargained for. Check-in/Check-out: Checking in, we were informed of a 14% \"resort fee\", to be expected I suppose. Check-in was relatively quick and painless. Check-out was a completely different story. We had a late breakfast before checking out, and when we returned to our rooms at 12:05 (check-out is Noon), our keys had been deactivated. We had to go to the front desk - which for us was down six floors and across the street - and wait in line for 15 minutes to get them reactivated. We were able to check out while we were there, saving us another wait in the huge line (no express check-out at the Conrad), which was a plus. One note, though, CHECK YOUR BILL. We had valet parking added to our total, for 4 nights, and we didn't even have a car. Luckily, I caught the error and it was credited back to us with no fuss. Make sure you go through your bill with them before you leave, just in case. Room: The room was fairly large size, but the bathroom was teeny! So small that I kept banging my elbow on the wall trying to dry off from the shower. The sliding bathroom door didn't close all the way, so there was little privacy. Also, no ventilation fan. There was a balcony, also a good size, but the railing was so loose, we were afraid to go anywhere near it. Our room overlooked the lagoon, with a view of the city. It was nice, but I would recommend asking for something in the main tower with an ocean view. Regarding the housekeeping, it was a bit spotty. Every afternoon, we returned to fewer pillows/towels/whatever. It's like they wanted to impress us the first day with a perfectly appointed room, and then didn't care after. Even the toiletries and face cloths hadn't been replenished 4 days into our vacation. It was really bizarre. I'm sure that if we'd asked, they would have brought more, but why would you need to ask? Neighbourhood: Ok, let me say that this area will not be for everyone. The hotel is surrounded by abandonded hotels and buildings and is next to a bridge that is currently under construction. There are two luxury condos and several restaurants/shops as well. It's an odd mix of the new, the old, the crumbling and the luxurious. We found the juxtaposition of these things kind of charming, but I know some will complain. We had no problem with the locals, they were all very friendly. We were, however, warned not to go out walking late at night. There were a few really charming places to eat down the road: Waikiki Restaurant and Oyster Bar - awesome food and staff. just wonderful! Ropa Vieja Restaurant has great food, Puertorrican/Cuban, though the service is a little cold. Picacho Cafe is a good little coffee shop, friendly. There's also a place called Puerto Peru down by La Concha, about 6 blocks away. Great ceviche, but horrible entrees and awful service. Avoid unless you reallllllly want ceviche, lol. Hotel Staff: Diego, the beach chair handler and the staff of the Cafe Caribe - particularly John - were super nice! Front desk was fine, courteous. Most of the staff were fine, if not a little indifferent, except for the hostess at Verita. A NY couple that was checking out the day we checked in raved about the food there, so we tried - twice - to go. The hostess was incredibly rude the two times we tried to book a table, so we just avoided it. Beach/Pool: Condado Beach (Playa Condadito) is a cute little place, emphasis on the 'little'. It is a very small area. All beaches in PR are public, I'm told, and that's pretty cool. The locals are really friendly, and there were no real problems with space, etc. My complaint is with - surprise - the hotel's policies. The beach chairs are collected at 5pm. Towels are to be returned by 6pm, or else you will be charged. By the way, the pools close at 5pm. Five o 'clock! On the beach, the chairs are free but the umbrellas are $10, $11 if you charge it to your room! Makes me wonder what the 14% resort fee was for. They nickel-and-dime you at every turn in this place. Hotel restaurants: Overpriced, with the exception of Cafe Caribe. $25 for 2 drinks at Aqua?! Avoid the Noodle 8 Bar at all costs. Expensive, oily noodles, cold service...yuck. Have breakfast at Cafe Caribe, overlooking the ocean, but wander out for lunch and/or dinner. You won't be disappointed. Major issues: On our third night, there was a power outage which affected the entire area. To their credit, they had generators running to keep power on in the rooms and to the guest elevators. Unfortunately, this happened at dinnertime, and only one of the hotel restaurants was able to serve, the pricey and rude Verita, and it was packed. We tried to walk down the road to find something open, but no go. Returning to the Conrad, We went back up to our room to wait out the power outage, hoping it would end and we could eat. After a few hours, the generators went off and the power was back on, so we headed to the elevators to head downstairs. That's when we heard the yelling and the banging. People were stuck. On the elevators. And the hotel didn't know until I called. Yeah, ponder that one for a while. So now, it is 1:18 in the morning - 5 hours after this ordeal began - and we are sitting in our room, eating some trail mix that we got for the flight home. Luckily we had a bottle of water, and didn't need to touch the $7 bottle of Fiji. Honestly, if it were not for the astounding natural beauty that is PR, and some awesome experiences we had with local establishments and outings, I would call this whole trip a bust. Bottom line is, these rooms go for $200+ per night. They have to do better than this. They just have to. Stay elsewhere, fellow travelers. By the way, go into Old San Juan and see La Fortaleza. Soooo worth it! There's a free tram with 28 stops, I think, throughout the area.

Won a $100 a night Priceline bid for Mon-Fri stay (weekdays are cheaper) and then upgraded to an ocean view room for $20 more a night. Payed a $45 resort fee as well. This was my third vacation in San Juan, Puerto Rico this winter. The Conrad had the best-looking rooms I've seen in San Juan aside from the DoubleTree Hilton (in San Juan). Modern chic. I was in a room with two Queen-size beds. There wasa huge bathroom (bigger than my bedroom at home). The shower was a large glass box that I thought was cool. Very impressed with the interior of the Conrad overall. Beautiful lobby. Beautiful pools. There was a small refrigerator in the room for storing your own water bottles a Walgreen's is about a 15-20 minute walk down the road). Definitely a 4-star hotel design. The ocean-view room had a balcony with two chairs and a small wooden table. I enjoyed watching the waves come in and break on the rocks, sending up spray. The hotel is on the flight path for private and local planes, so you'll see a lot of single and twin engine aircraft flying over as well as helicopters. The occasional ship floats by as well. The hotel has a small lawn in the back (right before the ocean) with hammocks and beach chairs for people to sun themselves on. On my last day, I tried out the chairs and saw small crabs come over the rocks to eat some of the grass. Neat. The pool area is large and truly resort style. There are bars, a restaurant, and waiters walking around to take your order. There is a booth where you give them your room number and they give you beach towels and let you rent snorkeling gear. There is a small public beach behind the pool area. Maybe 30 people could fit on the beach, and a busy road and an ugly temporary bridge runs right next to it. The water next to the beach is a nice calm lagoon area separated from the ocean by a wall of rocks. It's soothing to watch the waters break on the rocks and calmly seep into the lagoon. The Conrad is not a good beach hotel. I liked the pool for one day, but on the second day I took a taxi to Isla Verdes public beach ($16.50 + tip), which is about a 10-minute trip, where you can truly people watch. You can take the bus there too, which is much cheaper but takes longer. For a good beach-resort experience, I recommend a hotel on Isla Verdes beach (the Intercontinental or El San Juan are examples). The Conrad is mostly about the pool area and nice rooms. It's a bad people-watching hotel, as you're only limited to the people at the hotel. The hotel is in a mediocre location. There are several abandoned hotels (one large one and a few smaller boutiques) around the Conrad. They are neat to look at in an apocalyptic way, as they are completely gutted of everything save for a concrete skeleton and covered in colorful graffiti. I felt completely safe in the area, as there are police all over, and there are many other nice hotels just down the road, as well as many restaurants and stores. Free Wi-Fi was speedy while I was there. Restaurants are expensive. The doormen did a great job of opening doors and hailing cabs, but got smart with me when I asked, \"Where by the pool can I get beach towels?\" (the booth is somewhat hidden). They responded (\"By the pool.\" And then, \"So what's the question?). They seemed to think the question answered itself. I laughed it off, but still.

When he asked the woman at the front desk what she could do about the situation, she replied \"nothing.\" His room was over $300 per night, including taxes and resort fees, but no attempt was made to accommodate us in any way. We were also traveling on the Puerto Rico Sparkles special package, which included breakfast coupons, a casino voucher and other amenities. When we asked the woman who was checking us in about the free breakfast, she was not familiar with the package and had to ask someone else. Had we not asked, we would not have received our coupons or room discount. The next day, I had plans to go running with my friend in the morning. When he didn't show up at our scheduled meeting time, I went across the street to his room (my cityview room was in a separate building across the street - not convenient to hotel amenities like the pool and restaurants). The lights in the lobby were off, so I asked at the front desk why it was dark. A rude woman told me that there had been an incident on the street and that it was being worked on. As a hotel guest, I believe that I deserved a better explanation as it clearly affected my plans - my friend's alarm did not go off because the power went out - thank goodness I wasn't trying to catch a flight. On our last evening at the Conrad, my friend came back to his room after dinner only to find that it had not been cleaned. When he reported it to the front desk, they could not guarantee that it would be taken care of immediately. He asked how/if we could be compensated for his inconvenience, and we were given a food voucher and late checkout the next day. The staff at this hotel clearly resents tourists - it seems they are in the wrong industry.", "Date": "February 11, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Palatine, Illinois", "Title": "\u201cBeautiful..Definately will be going back to PR e!\u201d", "Author": "dvr615", "ReviewID": "UR96165406", "Content": "My boyfriend and I just got back.

We are a couple in our late thirties(have kids but travelled without) who like more boutique/modern hotels and this one loved up to our expectations. The hotel was obviously recently renovated and they did a fantastic job creating a cool vibe without being cold and pretentious. There were aspects of it you could tell were not updated or had minimal upgrades but overall it was modern, new, and inviting. The hotel itself has two towers, one on the ocean side and the other on the lagoon side(across street). Definitely worth being on the ocean side as convenience to the lobby and amenities is much easier. There are two main pools and one is salt water and the other has a swim up bar. The larger pool had a small waterslide and volleyball net for kids (which there were not many of). There is also a small public beach with a reef to snorkel out to. Not a great beach by any means but there is something and as another reviewer mentioned it is so worth driving to a local beach to see the beauty. Do not choose this hotel if you are looking for a beachside hotel experience. Location is key here being a 5 minute drive to Old San Juan. We loved that we could easily get to a different restaurant each night without driving far. The in/out valet parking was very convenient and the valet guys were very fast and friendly. The surrounding properties could use some help. It abutts an abandoned building and even a short walk down the street brings more abandonded buildings. There are only a couple places to walk to but overall it is isolated and you need a car (or taxi) to get anywhere. The hotel was quite busy with people of all ages. I noticed there were not many kids but if I were to bring mine I would probably pick a hotel with more amenities for them on a nice beach so I could see why there were not many. So onto service...we had reserved a junior suite. It was a big room overlooking the lagoon and city, had a large comfy sectional couch along a wall of sliding glass doors, and a very spacious bathroom. Although disappointed at first being on the lagoon it was actual very nice and quiet and our room was great. But to our surpise we awoke to a waterfall coming from a ceiling panel in the bathroom. We immediately called the front desk and alerted them and were told that they would need to move us to fix the problem. So we were leaving and were told to see them when we get back about the status of a room so we packed up our bags and put them at the concierge. Upon our return we were told the room was now fine and to go back to it. Funny enough 3 different employees commented on being surprised they were sending us back. So we went back both thinking the same thing was going to happen when the room above us used the jacuzzi again (that was what we were told was the problem). Then we get a call that our room type was overbooked and did we want an upgrade to a spa suite. We considered it until we saw the room that was right across the hall. In my opinion it was a downgrade....no balcony to sit on, no big comfy couch overlooking a great peaceful view, a jacuzzi I didn't want, and a view of the street above loud heating vents. We were offered a decent discount and then told we needed to move because our water leaking problem was really not solved...huh?! So I was not having a downgrade..it wasn't about the cost. It was about having a great experience. So once again we left and were told to come back and they would have another room for us. SO we get back and they show us a top floor 700 SF suite overlooking the ocean....OMG...the room was amazing and I do have to say Victor who was helping us really pulled through and the rest of the staff really did what they could to accomodate us. So after all the somewhat frustrating hoopla they gave us an amazing room that we enjoyed every minute of and the staff was extremely patient and nice the entire time. These things happen with leaks etc so we were in no way upset about it but really glad they came through with providing accomodations that met our expectations. Oh and I did check for bedbugs and saw no sign of them in the rooms we had My only complaint is the lighting in the bathroom is very dim. Could be a little brighter for getting ready but really if that is the only issue I don't really see any.", "Date": "January 31, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Atlanta, GA", "Title": "\u201cHere is what you need to know about the Condado Plaza\u201d", "Author": "mrvinotinto", "ReviewID": "UR94945786", "Content": "1. It's in a great location - a short drive to Old San Juan (5 minutes) and a short drive to the airport (15 minutes without traffic). Many restaurants nearby or a short cab ride away (again, within 15 minutes). 2. This is a city hotel, in the heart of the city. It's got a good number of facilities for being a city hotel in some prime real estate (great restaurants, a nice spa, nice pools, etc.), near to all the main attractions in San Juan. It's not a resort. There are resorts in Puerto Rico which have more space and more extensive facilities and are more of a destination resort. But they are 45-minutes to an hour outside of San Juan. You will need a car rental and do some heavier driving to get to restaurants and nightlife. It's a trade-off. 3. We reserved a Superior Room with OV and were pleased with our room. It was fresh, modern, comfortable, with a big bathroom. 4. It's a big hotel, so expect many people checking in and out. When we arrived, there was a big group. While the hotel had about 6 employees checking people in, we still had to wait a little bit. I didn't mind, and I could tell that they had enough employees and it was justa matter of being patient for a few minutes. 5. The hotel is in a waterfront location, but the front of the hotel does not have a beach. To the side, there are steps (heavily monitored), to a small public beach. This is by far, not the most amazing beach on the island. Make sure you drive or make arrangements to see one of the real beaches in Puerto Rico. The small beach here is suitable, though, for small children as there are breakers for the waves off-shore. 6. We ate at Varita - It was good! Definitely recommended. The staff was good with kids. The pool-side food service was also quite good. 7. The staff was friendly. No problems there. 8. There is a pool at the spa area that is smaller and more quiet and has a view of the lagoon. The free facilities at the spa were very nice - good jacuzzi and steam room. 9. We rented a car and parked (with in/out privileges) in the lot. It was $15 + tax per night (about $16-17). This is a good price for not having to worry about where to park in this area and we could come and go as we pleased. In conclusion, I think the location and facilities for the location are quite good here. We would stay again.

It has a nice view of the ocean and is protected by rocks in a way that there's not much in the way of waves. Great for those who want to wade or spend the day in water, not so great for those who like playing in the waves. 2. The hotel consists of 2 buildings, across the street from each other, and connected by an indoor elevated \"sky bridge\". The 2nd building does have a small, nice, quiet pool. But going to/from the lobby and main pool and beach area was a slight hassle and a bit of a trek. 3. Service in the hotel was up to par. Never much of a wait at reception. Courteous and helpful concierge and bell people. The place generally seems crawling with available staff. 4. The hotel is extremely clean and well-kept. Having a proximity between the ocean and a bay could lead to some dampness and mildew smells, but this was NOT the case anywhere in the Conrad. It felt fresh, cool, and clean. That said, we did find a waterbug/roach in the bathroom one day. I expect this is par for the course and possible now and then of any hotel in the tropics, be it 5-star or 1-star. We called housekeeping, who promptly took care of it. 5. I expected more in the way of nightlife/attractions in Condado. There are a few restaurants and quiet bars in the neighborhood, but be warned that it's a $15 cab ride each way if you're heading to Old San Juan. 6. The hotel has 3-4 restaurants, yet unless you are eating by the pool, none of them have outdoor seating. You cannot eat breakfast outside, one of my favorite things to do at a resort. 7. Stay away from Raul at the blackjack tables. He'll take everything you've got.", "Date": "January 21, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Asheville, North Carolina", "Title": "\u201cNo power and broken elevator\u201d", "Author": "rxkate", "ReviewID": "UR93020684", "Content": "We checked into the Conrad and they gave us a room very quickly even though we were there at 8:30 am.

I would never come back to this hotel again and strongly advise people not to stay here. THE BAD: Because of the snow storm in NY, our flight was delayed by 5 hours, which meant we arrived at the hotel at 7pm instead of 2pm. Why is this relevant? Because at 7pm (THREE HOURS after check-out time) we were told that our room wasn't ready because it hadn't been cleaned yet. However, it took 15 minutes to even find this out, because the person \"helping\" us at the front desk kept answering the phone while he was checking us in and wasn't communicating with us at all. Finally the night manager stepped in and offered to give us another (lesser) room to use while they cleaned our room. And after we complained, he offered us $100 credit to use at one of their restaurants. However, we wound up standing at the front desk for a full hour to work this all out. And during all this waiting, we struck up a conversation with a young woman who had been waiting since 2pm for her room. (i.e. Our situation was not unique...it was happening to others too.) When we finally got to our actual room (9pm!) it was not really clean. The counter-tops had crumbs and coffee stains on them and I was afraid to put anything on them because they looked disgusting. Despite complaining about this EVERY DAY, the counter-tops were never cleaned to our satisfaction. The room was very loud. Violent door slamming happened all through the night. (The bathroom doors slide instead of opening on a hinge, and I guess if you aren't careful the door will slam into the wall if you don't make an effort to stop that from happening.) But we were woken up 2-3x per night, every night, by incessant door slamming. The service at Cafe Caribe was ATROCIOUS! We had free breakfast every day with our package, and after two days I regretted it. The place would be 1/2 to 3/4 full and they'd have a line of people waiting to be seated. And when you asked why it was taking so long they'd say, \"we're very busy\" despite having many, many empty tables. Waiters and waitresses would walk by your table multiple times without making eye contact when you were clearly ready to order. (On one day, we literally sat for 40 minutes, menus closed and down, before standing up and waving our arms to flag someone down to take our order! And then we got burnt french toast...it was literally black.) Complaints to the manager were received in a professional way, but he clearly had no control of his staff and was unable to fix anything. Although the food was good, I'd avoid this restaurant at all costs. Pikayo, the hotel's \"high end\" restaurant, also proved to be disappointing. When telling us the specials, the waiter noted that the chocolate souffle needed to be ordered at the same time as the entrees because it took a long time to cook. So we did that. And then waited FORTY FIVE minutes after they cleared our plates for it to arrive because the pastry chef forgot about our order. We were the last ones in the restaurant and they were literally cleaning up before we finally got the dessert. The outdoor cafe is SUPER expensive and they automatically add the tip onto the bill. Service was super slow. And their \"happy hour\" which supposedly gets you half price drinks did not include the drinks we ordered. (of course!) The hotel hosted a New Year's Eve party that cost $80 per person. If you bought the ticket from the hotel it was $90. (we only got the lower price by accident...) This price gave you admission and \"open bar\". Well, the open bar consisted of beer, one type of vodka, one type of rum, and one type of whiskey. And the only drinks were what I like to call \"something and something\". So rum and coke was free. But a mojito (which is complicated to make but only has rum) was full price. Champagne was full price. Wine was full price. Etc. It was a major ripoff. At least the music was good... Finally, the casino is a dump and the waiter/waitress service is a joke. THE GOOD: The food and the service at Varita was excellent. The service issues we encountered were dealt with in a reasonable way. At Pikayo, our dessert and our wine was removed from the bill. At Cafe Caribe, one of our meals was free. (although we'd already paid ahead of time, so that didn't really help) In addition to the $100 food credit we received for not having the room ready, we complained to the Head Manager the next day and he took one night off our bill. That was nice. There is a lot of space to lay out by the pool and the beach, although small, was nice. THE VERDICT: This place has a lot of flaws. They do try to correct their mistakes, but there were just way too many of them in the course of one week for me to think it was just a coincidence. And as such, I can't recommend this place unless you happen to get an incredible deal. Although I only saw their lobbies and their restaurants, the La Concha (very close by), Marriott Stellaris (also close) and the El San Juan (in Isla Verde) were MUCH, MUCH nicer and fancier than the Condado Plaza.

This Xmas I decided to take a chance and start at the Caribe, but with the proviso that I could move the next day if not pleased. The Caribe is huge, sprawling, full of amenities, and a virtual city unto itself. Technically, It has everything you might expect or want from a large resort. However, it lacks intimacy and can feel overwhelming by the impersonal feel of such a megaresort. We moved the next day to the Conrad (after confirming that a oceanfront room with balcony was available) at about the same rate as the Caribe.

I have been here since December 26th and am supposed to be here until December 31. The hotel presented us to a very plush lobby and we were looking forward to our stay here BUT unfortunately it all stopped there. 1) We booked a CITY VIEW room but on arrival we checked into a room that faces the other tower of the same hotel. I immediately asked for a change and was told that my request would be handled the next day. When I called the next day, I was told the hotel is full. So I walked down at the front desk - to my surprise, the person on the front desk told me, \"The view to the other tower is a CITY VIEW\" and will not change the room - to that I created a bit of a noise and then a lady claiming to be the \"manager\" came and said she will change the room for me which she did. I thanked her and was happy....But wait a minute. 2) I moved my stuff to the new room and the wife and I went out for the day. We came back around 10p (Dec 27th) and noticed that our bathroom toilet refilled the tank every 10 minutes and made a loud noise. SInce it was 10p and we were so tired, we decided to ask for a fix the next day and tried to sleep. We were unable to sleep and got up groggy on the 28th (today) and on our way out for the day, told the front desk about the problem and requested to get it fixed before we came back. BUT to my surprise when we came back at 8p the issue persisted. I went down to the FD to inquire and the person had no clue of what was going on and told me that I should go back to the room and she will cal me for an update (this was after waiting 30 mins in line on a FD with only 1 person around 8pm). Since I did not hear back from anyone for 45 mins, I called again and was put on hold for 15mins before someone answered my call - the same woman said she will talk to the manager and put me on hold for another 15mins; at which point I disconnected waiting for so long. Around 945p the manager (so the person claimed) called me saying he will send someone....I am still waiting (its 10p) and I hope someone will show up. Regardless, this experience has left a bad taste and I will never recommend this hotel to to anyone. I don't want to change my room again (which they are now offering, after earlier claiming to be full) and am so tried with the service here...pathetic is an understatement!!! ...Oh wait a minute - the mechanic just came and \"FIXED\" the issue....NOTTTTT...barely 5 minutes after he left problem continues....so now I really call this a complete sucky experience! To recap - the hotel lobby is good, rooms are good (sans the noise), food is decent (for all of that I will come here again) BUT the service is the worst I have ever experienced - understaffed front desks, long ringing calls to the FD that go an answered and a mostly no so friendly FD staff especially a gentleman whose name I did not read. If you can live in a hotel w/o service this is a good bet else this SUCKS...and I don't demand high service standards and am an easy person to please....

My reviews covers the good, bad and ugly not only about the hotel but also the city in general. Safety: First, let's get the ugly out of the way. I was mugged at gunpoint at Carolina Beach in the Isla Verde area on Dec 18th and lost $180, my camera and all the pictures that I took at Old San Juan the day before. It happened at a quiet part of the beach but it was 1 pm in the afternoon and there were some people nearby. I have traveled around the world and this was the first time that I have ever got robbed. It may have been an isolated incident. But I strongly advise anyone traveling to San Juan be very careful and always leave passport and valuables at the hotel. Better yet, try not to be too adventurous and stay in the hotel zone. Condado area where Conrad and most other new resorts are located seems safe and there are lots of cops on patrol every day and night. Certain parts of Isla Verde seems shady, particularly the west end of the Carolina Beach where the high rise condos are located. Stay away from that area! Hotel: Conrad has recently gone through a multi-million dollar renovation and it really shows. The lobby is gorgeous and the room is tastefully decorated. The bed is very comfortable too. I was upgraded to an ocean view room and the view was truly spectacular! There are some downsides, however. The \"glass box\" concept of the shower stall may look good on paper but leakage is a big problem as mentioned in other reviews. Also, the doors are not sound proofed well and I could people talking in their rooms in the hallway. Compared to La Concha down the street, which is the \"in\" place in San Juan right now, Conrad is a little subdued and low key. But I quite liked Conrad as La Concha seems to be trying too hard with their super trendy lobby bar and courtyard restaurant. If you prefer loud house music and expensive drinks that come with it, La Concha is the place to go. But if you prefer a comfortable and contemporary hotel without too much noise, then pick Conrad. I do agree with some of the reviews on other two drawbacks of this hotel: a) The beach is very small and is open to the public. La Concha does have a better beach. b) The area around Conrad is a bit run down. However, everything nice is within walking distance. Overall, it is great value for the money that I paid on Travelocity. Food: You have to try the local delicacy Mofongo which is mashed plantain stuffed with shredded beef, pork or shrimps. Yummy! Make sure you visit Ropa Vieja just 5 minutes walk from Conrad. The food is amazing and very reasonably priced! For breakfast, you can save a couple of bucks at the Hacienda Don Jose near the hotel but the food is very mediocre and has very small portions. I also ate at Latin Star and Cafe De Angel across from La Concha. Average food and slightly over priced probably because of the location. Cafe Cabri at Conrad provides okay food and convenience. The 8 Noodle Bar is expensive. It cost me $30 to get 10 pieces of sushi. I did not try Varita at the hotel but heard good reviews about the food. Attractions: I'm a world traveler and Old San Juan is one of the most picturesque places I have ever been to. The two forts El Morro and San Christobal are both amazing. Most people only visit El Morro as it is THE landmark. But don't miss San Christobal. It is equally impressive if not more. The views by the ocean are absolutely stunning! The El Yunque Rainforest is about a 40 minutes drive away but it's definitely worth the trip. Make sure you take a hike in the forest and see the La Marina waterfall. You can book a tour to the forest at the hotel for $50 for half day and $75 for full day. Do not spend money on tours to old San Juan and/or the Bacardi factory. Not worth the $50/$75 they charge you! Simply take bus 21 or 53 (bus stop right outside the hotel) to old San Juan (75 cents one trip) and take the ferry to Bacardi (another 50 cents). And it's way more interesting to see the city that way. You get two free drinks at Bacardi! These are just some of the highlights of my trip. I got mugged for the first time in my life. But the scenery, history, culture and food kind of make up for it. If you have any specific questions about the hotel or San Juan in general, please feel free to shoot me an email.

(there is a big difference between a king and queen sized bed, but at that point we were too exhausted to care) Later to my surprise, the room and shower was a disabled access and ADA compliant. There were no shower doors to stop the flow of water to the bathroom. It was obvious that the Conrad Condado did not know what they were doing by giving us two queens instead of the king that they CONFIRMED TWICE (three times if you count the Orbitz booking) and giving us a disabled accessible/ADA room that we never requested. This room was was not acceptable since I was constantly slipping on the wet tiles when I got out of the bathroom. I called the front desk to complain and asked change rooms. The person at the front desk said that all rooms in the hotel were like that (which was a lie because eventually we were transferred to a room with a shower door). Later that evening I went down stairs to the front desk and complained about the obvious safety hazard. The front desk person/employee said she could not do anything about it because: (1) I PAID THROUGH ORBITZ AND THUS I GOT THE CHEAPEST ROOM--which would be the Disable Accessible room (complaint with the ADA, but a hazard for an able bodied person); (2) second she claimed that the hotel was booked.

Rather than attempt to get another employee to help her out or see if my transaction could be solved in a few key strokes (which it could have been since I was only checking out), the employee continued with the transaction; and at one point chatted for 5 minutes with the bell hop in front of me and the previous customer. At that point I asked if there was another employee or a machine that could do a quick check out. What I got a a curt \"NO, she was the only one there\", with no empathy that their guest was trying to catch a morning flight. The rooms do not make up the horrible service that a guest will receive at the Conrad. The rooms are not spectacular. The rooms are old and there are spots in the bathrooms ceiling where the maintenance staff have painted over spots of mold. I addition the bathrooms are small. I am 5'10\" 175lbs. and I can hardly fit in the bathroom. The pool and beach area are not that great. The speck of land that they call a beach is OPEN TO THE GENERAL PUBLIC AND CONSISTS OF A LAGOON NEAR THE AVENIDA ASHFORD BRIDGE. This a major security concern and it does not look all that inviting. Also the pool is open and is accessible from Avenida Ashford; one could just waltz in. Although, there is security, the fact that the pool is open to the street causes concern. Next to the hotel is a GUTTED-OUT hotel filled with graffiti, and an couple of apartments in the same condition as the said hotel. These structures give the Conrad a nice depressed look, but to be fair Avenida Ashford is prime real estate in the city. As a warning to other travelers and people wisely allocating their limited budgets on travel, AVOID THE CONRAD AT ALL COSTS! The hotel is not worth your hard earned money. The service is horrible and the staff needs to be trained in the finer points of customer service, especially for this hotel brand. In addition, regardless of where and what site I book my hotel, I should not be treated as a second class citizen. This is uncalled for and should not be tolerated by the management at the Conrad. This is the worst stay I had at a Hilton brand hotel. I travel 1-2 months a year for pleasure and business, and 70% of the time I stay at a Hilton brand hotel. I can assure you this is by far the worst treatment I ever received. I guess you get what you paid for... at the Conrad Condado, you also get ripped off.", "Date": "December 24, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Lincoln, Nebraska", "Title": "\u201cNice hotel, just don't expect a Conrad\u201d", "Author": "cjfosler", "ReviewID": "UR90586215", "Content": "Our experience at this hotel is mixed. I couldn't decide between 3 and 4 star. I ended on 4, it doesn't deserve a 3. You shouldn't expect a Conrad, though. We did but should have known better with the great rate we got. Our check-in experience was less than exciting. The man checking us in seemed a bit like he could care less that we were there...Whatever. The rooms are nice. Very cool decor. Excellent view of the ocean. The bed was comfortable. Plenty of space. The whole set up was fine for my husband and I although I would warn non-couples. The bathroom door isn't really a door. It's 2 sliders that meet in the middle, no latch or anything. The shower is a glass one in the middle of the room. This is also where the dresser/closet, coffee pot and safe are. What I'm saying is no privacy. The balconies are wonderful. Enough space for 4 to hang out. Total privacy. You can't see or hear anyone else. Speaking of hearing others, you can hear most of what goes on in the hall from your bed. And the doors slam. We did have a problem with the shower as we have with many glass showers in hotels lately. They leak. Our drain wasn't fast enough so the water leaked out the door. Hotels have errored in installing these. The first time I used the shower I got out and the bathroom was a lake. We called about this twice and never had anyone solve the problem. We would build a dam with towels when we showered so water didn't go all over the bathroom. You'd think the maid would have gotten tired of cleaning up soaking wet towels for 6 days. The beach is bad. Very small. The sand is nice until you get to the water, then it's all rock. We did enjoy the pools. They do serve food and drinks at the pool. Aqua is the bar/restaurant. Good food. Pretty good service. We also ate at Picayo. This is a fine dining restaurant. Prices are high but the atmosphere and food are great. Varita has good food. They call it casual but it's nicer than casual. Service was bad. Not that friendly and very slow. Cafe Caribe is ok food, nothing exciting. Slow service. Even just for drinks. The casino is nothing great at all. Not the exciting casino atmosphere you may be looking for if you like Vegas. There is not 24 hour room service. They close at 10, I think. No mini bar in the room. They lost money on us, we would have used one.

I chose to visit Puerto Rico for my Anniversary and could not imagine how overwhelmingly exquisite the Conrad San Juan Condado Plaza would be.

Ask your questions and you will receive your answers, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s that simple. From fine dining to your regular American restaurants there is so much to do for every budget it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s truly your choice. Activities are endless! All you have to do is see the activity coordinator and they will set you up based on your personal preferences. The Conrad San Juan alone has many amenities itself like several restaurants, a personable beach, several pools and several Jacuzzis on both sides of the buildings (just select M in the elevator and walk to the left to access the second half of the Conrad San Juan) You will also find the Casino there where I will hope you run into \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Buddy\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd \u00ef\ufffd\u0160 we seem to bump into him our entire stay and he too was very informative about the Hotel, its amenities and any other questions we had about the area. He was very professional and always asked us if we were enjoying ourselves and made recommendations. The night life on the weekend was like a ballroom out of a movie. On Friday and Saturday the Conrad truly goes all out with the bar areas located on their main lobby floor. Everyone was dressed elegantly and the atmosphere was again very remarkably put together from the mixture of music to the lighting and modern d\u00c3\u00a9cor throughout the entire area. A couple of areas I would like to recommend are also listed below beginning with the BEST breakfast place which is located less than 100 feet from the Conrad. When exiting the hotel just walk to the left and you will see the Ocean Front sign that reads $7.25 for breakfast( which also includes your coffee and orange juice). This place will seat you right at ocean view and has an old rustic look that truly represents the old Latin style. If you continue to walk you will find all your shops and many more restaurants. I have two dinner areas to recommend and one will be the Puerto Peru Restaurant which is in walking distance from the Conrad San Juan I had the filet mignon with chimichurri sauce that was to die for. If you go into the old San Juan, please visit the Latin Roots Restaurant. If you find parking or take a cab, you should definitely just park and walk around because that area is very beautiful. The Latin Roots Restaurant has a trolley that drives around promoting the restaurant which is why I'm suggesting you park\u00ef\ufffd\u0160. You have to ride the trolley because after he takes you to the restaurant the driver will tour around town and explains some of the sites before he takes you back to where he picked you up at. I actually went there for lunch so I didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t get to experience the night club that I didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t know they had. When I return to PR -that is definitely on my lists of things to do because the set up they had was for a live band so that alone is a guaranteed good time. I truly can go on for days about my wonderful experience but I would just like to end with a very special thanks to Leah Rossi. Leah Rossi is the Concierge Guest Service Manager who is a great asset to the Conrad San Juan Hotel. She truly represents the establishment as elegantly and professional as it is. Because it was my Anniversary and a surprise to my husband I needed help with putting it all together and she sincerely made my special requests go exactly as planned with a little extra touch of her own. I cannot thank her enough for making it go as smooth and special as it did. I will definitely go there again only next time it will be with my family (can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be selfish all the time \u00ef\ufffd\u0160).

Also, my only real complaint is that this is a non smoking property with smoking limited to very few areas around the property. The pool is not one of these areas and yet when I complained to security about people smoking IN the pool at the pool bar (and sometimes ashing their butts into the water), nothing was really done. They were talked to, but then just lit up again when they thought no one was looking. At one point, I couldn't even go into the pool becase of a group of women smoking like chimneys at the bar.

I booked this hotel at the recommendation of friends who'd just come back from San Juan and local, Puerto Rican friends. Since I did it through my credit card points program, I didn't have much control over the size and location of the room so I read trip advisor reviews and came across the name and contact information of Leah Rossi, the manager there. I got in touch with her and she was incredibly accommodating and kind with all my requests, even when we almost had to cancel the trip (hurricane Earl!) and she offered to waive all cancellation fees if we did. When we got to the hotel we found out we had a beautiful 10th floor ocean view room with a king sized bed and balcony (I think she upgraded us for free)! Leah even sent up a complimentary bottle of champagne since we'd told her it was our overdue honeymoon, which was just the cherry on top of our awesome-so-far trip! Since we stayed here at the end of a 6 day trip and after spending 4 days burning to a crisp on a gorgeous island, we were mostly interested in relaxing and lounging by a poolside. This hotel was perfect for that - 3 pools, lots of lounge chairs and a bar in the middle of the main pool (albeit an expensive one, but then what hotel bar isn't?). I didn't even bother going onto the tiny beach area though my husband did and said it was too rocky to swim. We ended up spending a lot of our time hanging out by the pools or on our balcony reading and enjoying the breeze and the sound of the waves. I did however, take heed of some important points running through most Trip Advisor reviews: 1. Don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t leave valuables in the room. 2. Have breakfast at Hacienda Don Jose down the street \u00e2\u20ac\u201c DELICIOUS, authentic, inexpensive and beautiful beach-front view. 3. the hotel apparently gives out free drink vouchers at check in which we did NOT know to ask for. Another couple staying there gave us theirs since they were leaving before they had been able to use theirs, so ask for them! In all, a great end to a fabulous trip.

I brought my own snorkel gear. The gym is great with lots of equipment plus a sauna, steam shower and hot tub. The room was clean and with a city view, we still had a good view of the ocean. We were big fans of the Waikiki restaurant down the street. Maid service kept running out of clean glasses and bottled water. Everything was great until we left the hotel - we had a good deal with 100 a night with fourth night free plus 75 credit. When I asked the front desk about the 75 dollar credit, they said it could be applied to the room. When we checked out, I made sure the 75 dollar was applied and was ready to jump in the cab to the airport. The front desk called to say they were removing the 75 credit and we had to spend it on hotel services. Impossible with a plane to catch. I asked for a manager to call my cell phone.

We all got in on a Sat. morning and meet at the hotel.Our room wasnt ready so we went to the pool bar,as we sat down we both waited 15 min. for someone to even acknowlegde that we were there, this happened throughout the trip.The attendants do not speak unless spoken to. Not all of the workers act this way but most.We got our room and we were meeting friends for dinner so i put my cash($1000.00) and some other belongings in the safe, And i took my card to pay for dinner. The next day the group was going out to do some site seeing and some shopping, so my girlfriend tried to open the safe and it would not open. She tried twice and called me to try and i tried three more times and on the fourth time it finally opened which, was a little funny to me.So i get the money out so we can leave and there is $400.00 dollars missing from the $1000 that i put in the safe. We checked everything and everywhere and no money ,and i didnt use any cash because it was all in 100 dollar bills and i had been using my card sense we got there.I go down to the front desk to let theyoung lady know what happened. She calls Mr. Jesus Mesa. He is supposed to be the head of security at the Conrad. I tell him the whole story and he says that he will get to the bottom of it and he will go get the door code to see who has come in and out of the room, and call his director to get the safe readings.So i said o.k and i did'nt want this to totally ruin my vacation and my friends vacation. I filled out a statement put my cell,address all my info on it. A friend of mine comes over to talk to Mr. Mesa and myself and Mr. Mesa getts very defensive and says that the person that cleaned the room could file a defamation of character suite against me if i'm not telling the truth.Which was very unprofessional on his part because him nor his staff are missing anything. To make a long story short we were planning to be gone the next two days In St.Thomas and some other activities, i didnt hear or see Mr. Jesus Mesa or his supervisor.Mr. Mesa did the bare minimum to help me. All i got was a copy of my statement and two phone call messages left on the room phone saying that they want to schedule a time to come in the room to check. Thats the last time i heard anything from Mr. Jesus Mesa or anybody for that matter. A word of advise to Mr. Jesus,Supervisors and whom ever this may concern,( PEOPLE WHO ARE ON VACATION DON'T STAY IN THIER ROOMS,SO CALL THE CELL PHONE OR LEAVE A WRITTEN NOTE IN THERE ROOM). If they were concerned they would have tried harder to get intouch with me. Plus i gave them promission to do a door and safe reading, but nothing was done. At least make me feel that something is getting done.This whole event could have been handled in a very different and professional way. Mr. Mesa and supervisor whom i still have not seen and the ladies at the front desk did'nt know anything about, they all should retake an investigation and customer service course so that this doesn't happen in the futher.", "Date": "October 30, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Houston, Texas", "Title": "\u201cAwesome experience!\u201d", "Author": "bondgirl0068", "ReviewID": "UR85277944", "Content": "Travelled with some girlfriends to San Juan, Puerto Rico...we chose the Conrad for it's proximity to Old San Juan and town in general.

HOwever, the bed was so comfy it didn't even bother me!! We stayed in the Ocean tower and had a fantastic view. While laying in bed we could look out over the balcony and see the ocean--it felt like being on a cruise ship. The bathrooms were very clean and trendy. It was a little strange to step out of the shower and have the closet in the bathroom, but because the room was so large it wasn't a nuisance. We took pictures of the bathroom because we liked it so much! We ate at the hotel and while it is expensive, it was a nice alternative for when we were too tired to go out. If you need a break from the heavy Puerto Rican food, there is a Chili's within walking distance! The bus stops right next to the hotel, so you can get to Old San Juan for about 75 cents or something. The beach is a public beach with access right from the busy road. It is more of a lagoon with a beach is still nice. The recommendations given by the concierge were very helpful and the woman working there was incredibly nice. We rented a car to travel to the rain forest and that was worth the money because we had a car for the day to use and getting around was actually pretty easy. I had heard horror stories of traffic but it didn't seem any different from home...although I'm used to New Jersey traffic.

I called the hotel to inform them that I needed the room for only 3 nights. Instead of just shortening my reservation the staff member said she would charge me $159 which was the current AAA rate. I explained the situation, and she insisted that I would have to pay a higher fee. To this day this does not make sense to me, but I really had no choice since I was going to a conference and had to leave early. Moreover, when I arrived, the staff almost assigned me to the wrong reservation and was going to put me in a junior suite, then a king ocean view until I pointed out that they have the wrong name.

We later learned that we should've stayed at Gran Melia in Rio Grande or El Conquistador in Fajardo for a tranquil, beach setting. But I do recommend staying your first night at Conrad Condado Plaza to visit Old San Juan (for restaurants, shopping, and the forts) for your first day, then head onto Gran Melia or El Conquistador. Good things Conrad Condado Plaza has: great views (waves crashing against rocks, ask for 3rd floor ocean view), very comfortable beds, clean rooms, large balconies, large bathrooms, and nice/helpful staff.

This hotel had a dual personality. I booked a city view but was upgraded to a lagoon view w/o a problem! The hotel was ok . The staff was wonderful except the concierge desk but i'll get to that later. I never had a problem with the elevator. I was there when there was a teacher convention going on and waited once. So i don't agree with the other reviews. My room was right by the elevator and the ice machine, and i will say that i didnt hear much of any noise. I too had the water problem. I put a towel half inside and outside the shower and the stoped the leaks. The grounds are beautiful. the pools and the hammock area, The water beating against the rocks!. The gym had very nice machines. I didn have to wait for a machine. I used the elipical rider and there were only 2 of these machines, so that is saying something. The food was subpar. I dont care if you are at a hotel and this is to be expected, NOT! I am not sure what hotel other people stayed in previously but i have stayed at the very nice and very high class places and it is the trend that these hotels have dual hotels to accomodate to the the different patrons so it is very common now to have to seperate hotels that connect. and both hotels had acces to one of the THREE pools there. I knew going about the \"resort fee\", fine but i thught this fee covered such things as the towels, fitness rooms and internet access. Imagin my suprise that they charge u by the 1/4 hr for access of the computers. Yes you will pay an average of $10-15 for trips in the cabs, but to be honest on how people drove i was happy to fork over the cash. The drivers were informative and very nice.The DJ at the lounge was excellent. I wish this hotel was furher down the strip in the mpre trendy part. Yes it is near an abandon building, but there was a lot of construction going on in this area. But while i was there i saw city workers and business owners cleaning up every morning! I seen police everywhere and security was eerywhere on the hotel lunge including by the entrance to the public beach. I didnt go to the public beach to be honest. Our second day there we went to Playa Flamenco beach , and to tell u the truth once u see this beach how could u go to any other there. The pool was 24hrs and we spent our nights there. I just wish it was more lively there. We went to another hotel down the street to thier lounge, however hands down our hotel had the better music. but we wanted to be around more people. If you are looking for a quiet time this is for you. or If u have a lot of things that you will be doing and u want t come back and relax this is for you. Now on my way checking out. i needed some of Puerto Rico's finest Alcohol shipped, the one lady at the desk was rude. I beleive that this may have been the manager. the Doorman and her assistant was more helpful to our plight than she. My suggestion Brand your lunge area, get the people in. Do something about the showers and try to have more activities on the premises. Yes u have a tennis court, but u have to pay for that ( what does this resort fee really cover) By the way go to the Haceinda for breakfast , for the views and thier breakfast is very decent. All in all i might stay again if the deal was right. would rent a car ONLY to get to the night life. part of the harm was walking around Old San juan.

The hotel is located in the beautiful \"Condado\" which is actually a slum. I parked my car in their garage ($15 a day) and then brought my bags inside for check-in. I get to the front desk to get my room key and head off to my room. I booked an Ocean Vista room and they gave me a City View room. I go back downstairs and tell the young man at the desk I was given the wrong room. I found the confirmation email proving i booked for an Ocean Vista room and then they agreed to give me an Ocean Vista room, but it was going to take at least 2 hours because they needed to clean the room. A nice bell-hop came by and asked to help us with our bags. He took our bags and gave us a ticket for our bags once our room is clean. We decided to take a stroll down the street because we had 2 hours to kill while we waited for our room to be clean. The building adjacent to the Conrad is an empty 6 story building with broken windows and doors with graffiti all over it. You will come to find out that Puerto Ricans put graffiti on every building they can find. We walked further down the street just to find more empty buldings with graffiti on them with a restaurant here and there, but pretty much nothing is in the Condado. We walk back to the Conrad after almost 2 hours had expired and our room was still not ready. Our room was not ready until 3 and 1/2 hours later. We finally got our Ocean Vista room with the excellent view of the Atlantic Ocean. When we were in our room we could hear everything that was happening in our neighbor's room from him using the bathroom to his entire conversation on his cell phone. It was like he was in our room! There is absolutely no privacy in your own room unless you whisper. Also, the hotel puts a $50/day charge on your credit card for \"incidentals\", which they don't tell you about at check-in. The hold is supposed to be released 24-48 hours after checkout, and I have been home for 72 hours now and there is still a hold on my credit card. My best advice is not to go to the Conrad, but if you decide to go: print your confirmation of what you have reserved and purchased, be prepared to speak to staff that doesn't comprehend English very well, and don't leave your bag with the bell-hop because your bags are left unattended for periods of time in the lobby and their is tons of theft in San Juan.

What we hated: First of all, the hotel really is two hotels joined by a walkway tube, which is very inconvenient if you are in the building further from the beach (which we were). So when we were on the beach, we had to shlepp through two hotels before getting to our room. Also, there is only one hotel gym for the two buildings. This means possible wait time to use equipment. The elevators are barely functioning. It stopped at every floor, regardless of guests. So we attempted to use the stairs, but that didn't work because the doors to get into each floor (except 1) were locked. Terrible showers...sprayed all over the bathroom floor. The pressure seems that meant for cleaning elephants. We ended up not having enough towels because we had to use them to sop up the water laying on the floor. The beach is very, very tiny and located right next to a traffic-filled bridge...not very relaxing. The constant passing of low-flying airplanes also too away from the experience. There is an oddly placed sushi restaurant adjacent to slots...not within it's own walls. So if you want to enjoy sushi, you have to hear all the slot machine casino noises. There is an additional 14% room charge...for poorly thought out facilities and gaudy art? It wasn't all terrible. There was a really great restaurant called Varita.

The Conrad was the third hotel. It was definitely our \"splurge\" hotel. We got a special summer getaway deal advertised on their website. So the cost of the hotel was not much more on average than the other two places we stayed at. First, I want to address a previous review from a guest who wrote that security was non existent and her/his room was robbed. I was quite concerned and asekd the hotel about their security. Their prompt reply and detailed explanation about the mesaures they have in place assured me that it would be a safe hotel. And it was. This is an upmarket hotel with a casino on the mezzanine floor. We glimpsed it when we breakfasted at the cafe on the first day. We did not frequent the casino as we were not interested. Instead, we focused on the swimming pools (one salt water) and the great beach right by the hotel. All beaches in PR are public beaches. So yes, while hotel guests had free access to the lounge chairs, there were also puerto rican families and other tourists on this quite small beach (compared to Ocean Park). However, it didn't get too crowded. The water is wonderful, very clear with lots of fish and interesting sealife. There is also a \"secret cove\" area as my sons liked to call it. There is a line of large rocks that help create a lagoon so the water by the hotel/Condado Beach is very calm. Be mindful of the sea urchins by the rocks though. Wear water shoes! Right by the beach, it's sandy in the water, and I didn't see any sea urchins. They seem to be propagating by the millions by the rocks. The room was great. very spacious. I called the hotel and asked if they could arrange an early check in and they did, and put us in an ocean view room. The beds were comfortable. The hotel staff were efficient and friendly. one evening, we had brought back some dessert and wanted some silverware, and room service brought it up without any fuss. The bathroom was spacious! Well lit with ample closet space. There is a safe and a fridge (lots of mini marts around that you can stock late night sodas). We went from our hotel room to the pool without having to pass through the lobby or any of the public areas. There is a self service laundry and a game room on the pool level. There is also a pool bar. We did not eat in any of the restaurants. instead, because of its location, it was very easy to find places to eat within walking distance. We had a car (parking is $15 per day) and used that to find places to eat. bear in mind that cabs cost $15 per trip for short journeys. So if you're planning on going to Fajardo or Humacao, El Yunque etc, you should consider renting a car. They have covered parking. There was always a security guard by the entrance between the public beach and the hotel area. Guests were identified by the usual wristband. The pools are open 24 hours. The grounds are very pleasant. There were hammocks and loungers. It seems to be a popular spot for weddings. For breakfast as part of our package, we were provided with continental breakfast vouchers worth $7 per voucher. These could be redeemed at the cafe caribe or at starbucks. If you took the voucher to starbucks, you got 20% off your order. We opted for starbucks after the first day at Cafe Caribe. Kids just wanted something fast rather than a sit down meal. I can't stress how nice the location is - very lively. Yes, it is right next to a bridge that seems congested a lot (there is a new bridge being built). And you do get a glimpse of the traffic now and then. but I didn't notice the noise from the traffic (and I notice noise! I asked the hotel to have some guests in the hottub settle down when they were a little too loud at 12:30am...). Yes, it is a \"big\" hotel. It's not a cozy B&B. we do like those, but we wanted to end our vacation with a resort hotel. I'm sure there is a lively nightlife scene around here but by 9pm, after our busy day, we just enjoyed relaxing and enjoying the view of the ocean and the occasional cruise ship on the horizon from the room. We scubaed right off the beach in the next lagoon (next to the Caribe Hilton) and it was an easy 15 minute walk from the Conrad to the park and beach. We were a 15 mins drive from the Bacardi Factory tour (which is FREE by the way! you just have to get there and the tour is FREE! and you get 2 drinks each). We were only an hour and a bit from Monkey Island (kayaked), a 30 minute drive from El Yunque, 10 - 15 mins from Ocean Park (really nice long beach) and about 20-30 mins to Old San Juan.

I felt like I was imposing on his personal phone conversation when asking about info for trips to the rain forest on more than one occasion. I probably should have said something to his supervisor.

The coffee was so bitter no amount of cream or anything else would have made it taste better. We did complain about the individual creamers left out in dishes on the tables in the heat and which were all spoiled and curdling the coffee. We were told that that was how they did things in the restaurant, so we got hold of the manager and told him. Next day the creamers were off the tables and in the fridge where they should have been all along. The only saving grace is that from this cafe the view is stunning.

This was the first time that we had been at the property since it changed hands to the Conrad/Hilton from a competing hotel chain, and we had a very good time. Although overall, the hotel staff is excellent, unfortunately, we had an incident with an extremely rude front desk worker by phone. Being the face and voice of the hotel, front-desk personnel can really make a lasting bad impression if they don't treat guests with the required respect and courtesy. The front desk (and the elevators) are horribly overworked at peak hours, which can make for spotty service and other inconveniences. The room that we got, ocean front with a king bed, was very nice other than the blood-red color scheme that they chose for the decor. The balcony is a real treat-- extra spacious with a world-class ocean view. Although we got a good rate for the room itself, food and beverage are extremely expensive for the category of hotel (i.e. luxury hotel prices at a non-luxury property), and the room service menu is the poorest we've ever seen.

The check in process was easy and our room was exactly what we had paid for (Superior Ocean View). Nicely decorated. The view from our balcony was breathtaking. The beds were very comfortable. The staff was friendly and helpful. The restaurants are a little pricey but the food is worth every penny. The swim up bar was busy while we were there but worth the wait. The property location is within 5 minute walking distance of an excellent public beach. 5 minute taxi ride to Old San Juan. Located on a nice lagoon area for snorkeling (be sure to take water shoes for kids). Starbucks in lobby area. If staying for a few days I would recommend a $10 taxi ride to grocery store. This is a great way to save a few $$$'s when traveling with a family. Chili's restaurant is within walking distance. The property has security on staff and in a safe area. Our trip was wonderful!

We stayed one night before and two nights after. We got a ridiculous deal by doing Name your Own Price through priceline, so I think the room was about $100 or so a night with all taxes/fees. The location is great, has amazing views of the ocean and it's own beach area. The hotel itself is very modern and beautiful. Both stays we had a lagoon room on the inside tower, the first night our view faced the tower on the ocean but we could see the ocean off to the sides. The room was clean, very nicely decorated and comfortable. The shower pressure was insanely strong, although our first room was missing the seal under the glass door and water ended up everywhere! The second half of our trip we had a room that faced the bay/lagoon. The first room had a really musty smell so I asked to be moved and we promptly were. The second room had the same smell - I suppose just from the ocean and moisture. It definitely didn't deter us from enjoying our stay - after a few minutes we didn't even notice it. This is the only reason I can't rate this place a 5. The pool area is gorgeous. The bar was pretty quiet in the evening, but we made friends with one of the bartenders and we really enjoyed sitting out and listening to the coqui. We used the fitness area and it it was small, but had pretty much anything you might need. The restaurants in the hotel are very good, we ate at Cafe Caribe twice. The breakfast was very good - and the coffee... ohmygoodness - the best coffee ever! We also ate at Eight Noodle Bar but I was too tipsy to remember if it was good. Overall we were extremely happy with our stay at Conrad Condado, we will definitely be going back and wouldn't think of staying anywhere else. Very often I find myself reminiscing about our trip and wishing I could be back at Conrad Condado drinking a cup of the delicious coffee and staring out at the beautiful blue water. Also - A few memorable places outside of the hotel - this little unassuming restaurant called Mojitos in Old San Juan - the most amazing Carne Frita - the most tender delicious pork I have EVER had EVER. =) Budathai - this really cool Spanish/Asian fusion restaurant down the way on Ashford that was recommended to us by the bartender at the hotel.", "Date": "July 21, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Goshen, New York", "Title": "\u201cTHE BEST!!\u201d", "Author": "Mackinac371", "ReviewID": "UR71806976", "Content": "My husband and I have gone to Puerto Rico a number of times.

I came here with my husband for our honeymoon and could not have picked a better place. I notified Edgardo De Jesus (saw his responses to previous trip advisor posts) about my upcoming visit for my honeymoon and he was wonderful enough to upgrade our room, give us an early check-in, and had a bottle of champage waiting for us in the room. I could write SO much about this place but I'm just going to point out a few highlights and things that people may not have written in other posts. *Rooms were beautiful and very clean- pics on website were accurate. The ocean view room had the most amazing ocean view of any other hotel I looked at- you're literally RIGHT on the ocean. *The entire hotel and hotel grounds were VERY clean and in great condition. *Elevators were always very quick, contrary to MANY other posts. There was only 1 time (saturday night) that the elevators were slow but that's to be expected- there was a wedding and many other things going on at the time. Other than that, they usually came within 15 seconds. *The fitness center was pretty nice and open 24hrs. It had ellipticals and treadmills with TV's, numerous weight machines, sauna, showers, bathrooms, and free weights. *The pools were great and ALL OPEN 24hrs!- there was a jacuzzi, a main pool with swim up bar, a salt water pool, and kiddie pool. I was surprised to find that there was a small waterslide in the main pool since I didn't remember reading anything about that. There's also a public beach right off the pool area- the water is very calm and clear. The beach didn't seem crowded at all on the weekdays. It is right off the road but I didn't mind at all. Towels & chairs were complimentary. *Take a few mins and lay on the hammocks by the ocean - so relaxing!! *All the staff were very friendly. As mentioned before, the maids are great- you can always find them and they're always willing to give extra towels. *My husband and I got the couples massage right next to the beach- it was GREAT. It was $100 for both of us for 1/2 hour... not something I normally do but well worth it for the occassion. *I recommend renting a car unless you're the type that likes to stay at the hotel most of the time. I liked having the flexibility of being able to go wherever and whenever- I've also heard the taxis are expensive and can rip you off. Self-parking was $15/day, but still worth it. I got a rental car on expedia for $125 for the week... so it pays off. *I also recommend staying here for a few days and staying in another area of Puerto Rico for another few days just to get away from the city and get a change of scenery. Although, you may want to save this place for the last part of your trip- it was pretty hard to leave. *Take east island excursion's snorkeling/beachcombing trip to Culebra (small island off the east coast of PR)- unforgettable experience. It's $89 per person- they take you to Carlos Rosario for snorkeling- one of the best snorkeling spots in puerto rico and then they take you to Flamenco Beach which is rated 1 of the top 10 beaches in the world by the travel & discovery channel as well as other publications where you can hang out on the beach, chill on the boat, or do more snorkeling. They also give you free rum drinks (and alcohol-free drinks) the entire time plus a great buffet lunch. I believe they also provide transportation to the marina for like $20 (they're located in Fajardo which is about an hour from San Juan). The crew is great and it's a ton of fun. *Other recommended activities- a trip to old san juan, parasailing in Isla Verde (about 10min drive from the hotel)- AMAZING!!, go to Escambron Beach - a pretty nice calm water public beach just over the bridge on the way to old san juan (way less crowded on the weekdays than the weekends)", "Date": "June 16, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "San Juan, Puerto Rico", "Title": "\u201cA total quality hotel\u201d", "Author": "nmunoz50", "ReviewID": "UR67159607", "Content": "A group of 292 business colleagues participated in a Workforce summit for one day, and the logistics of the hotel, the service and comfort were excellent.

My brother and I were there from 28 May-03 June 2010. Honestly, it was a great package and a great property. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m a Hilton Honors member, so I am partial toward Hilton properties. Additionally, as a former manager for Swiss\u00c3\u00b4tel Chicago, I have high expectations when staying at other properties. Conrad didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t disappoint me. The rooms were quite clean and Housekeeping was always on the floor to give us additional towels and amenities as we needed them. Also, the Doormen, Concierge, and Front Desk staff were quite friendly, courteous, and helpful with our needs, especially in booking tours and finding places outside the hotel to eat, drink, and shop. There was a lot of traffic in the hotel during this time. I guess it was to be expected over Memorial Day weekend. Still, this didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t diminish the quality of our stay, nor did we notice any decline in service with regard to the staff\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s ability to meet our needs. I think they did a fine job in accommodating everyone: the tourists, special groups, and even high school students (they had a prom almost every night during our stay) on property. They have two pools and a hot tub. The lagoon is okay, but it isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t a beach. If you are looking for a more active beach, there is one about 5-10 minutes (walking) from the hotel and it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s pretty nice. I was content just hanging by the pool. There is a 24 hour fitness center (accessible by room key.) It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not Gold\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Gym, but it has the basics to get the job done. If needed, there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s an International Fitness further down (15-20 minutes walking) in Condado. Additionally, almost everyone runs outside! For day spa, check out Euforia (about 15-20 minutes, walking) in Condado. Marc is the lead guy there and he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s very friendly and funny. There are a number of places to eat. Starbuck\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s is RIGHT OUTISDE the hotel door. This was a nice amenity to have and so convenient! My brother and I also frequented Varita, located in the opposite tower of the hotel. They have an \u00e2\u20ac\u0153all-day happy hour\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd that was GREAT, especially to watch the NBA games. (Jesus is one of the bar staff and he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s pretty cool.) However, they are a bit pricy so unless you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re going for drinks, or want to eat close to the hotel, you might want to venture out a little more. Two places to checkout for breakfast: Danni\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s and Bar Columbo. Both are VERY reasonable and will give you greater reason to check out the other places of interest in the Condado area. There is also a Subway and a Chili\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s about 15 minutes away (walking.) My advice: don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t rent a car unless you ABSOLUTELY HAVE TO. Parking is expensive and scarce, not to mention, there are ALWAYS traffic jams in Puerto Rico and the Condado area gets congested at various times throughout the day. Probably better to rent a car for a day or so, tour the island, then get rid of the car. There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s plenty to see on foot in the Condado area and if need be, take a cab (i.e. to Old San Juan or the Mall.) Even consider riding the bus into the local area (bus is $.75-exact fare only.)

All of the pictures that are on the hotel's site as well as the ones posted here by other vacationers are accurate with one exception. The room does seem a little smaller than what the pictures portray. There were four people in the room and we were very comfortable. So it's not that the room is small, we just built up a different expectation. The setup is a little weird with the coffee maker and fidge in the bathroom but that is easily overlooked because the bathroom is gorgeous. Plus we don't drink coffee. The shower is completely glass so if you are shy, just close the bathroom door. There were so many reviews that indicated that the glass shower was a problem but it wasn't at all. The beds in the room were extremely comfortable and it was hard for me to lie down on it without falling asleep. The hotel is also very clean. My party and I would leave early in the morning and come back later in the afternoon and the cleaning ladies would still be hard at work. I soon realized why. They mop the tile floors every single day! Our room was spotless every single time that we returned and getting extra towels has never been so easy. The beach and pools are great too. I will admit that staff was not always able to answer questions, but if they didn't know, they found someone who did. My only complaint is that the prices in the restaurants were a little high. My cousin and I each had a cheeseburger and fries with a margarita and our total came to $68! Needless to say that we found other places in the area to eat. ANd there are many. If you are looking to do a lot of partying, this may not be the best location for you. However, there was never an issue getting a taxi. They are lined up at the hotel all day and night.

We were booking another excursion and she gave us full details on it and we also found out on the rainforest trip that we had already done that we actually had three options. My parents and I were a little disappointed because the one we did was not the one we intended to do. The other two were so much better.

The rooms were 'fine'....nothing special, but not bad either. Our bathroom was quite spacious for a basic hotel room. While our room on the fourth floor faced the ocean, it also overlooked the not-so-attractive roof of another part of the hotel. The outside pool area of this hotel was nice enough. The beach was ok, but certainly not as nice as many other caribbean beaches. At this hotel's strip of 'beach', not only it is quite short, but the views from the beach aren't particularly nice. To your left is traffic leading to a bridge that is currently under construction and across from the beach, and within view, are some other buildings that are under construction.. That said though, it was certainly 'tolerable\". The sand was nice enough, and as long as you just want to lie there to feel the breeze, hear the ocean, and feel the sun, this beach will do the trick. One thing I didn't like so much was that hotel guests must pay $11 for the use of a beach umbrella. (Beach chairs and towels however are free.....) Note that there is also no food/beverage service on this beach. If you want anything to eat/drink you must go to the cafe by the pool. As for dining at this hotel, we got pizza one day at the pool cafe. The pizza was just 'ok'. Another day we went for breakfast to the cafe on the Mezzanine level, just opposite the casino. This place was quite bad on a number of levels. First off, the atmosphere if you will, was horrid. Think of your average airport cafeteria and that was what this place felt like. The service was also quite nonchalant. We each ordered pancakes, and it took 45 minutes from the time we placed our order to receive it. The waitress never offered to check on the order or voluntarily update us on why it was taking so long. It was only when we glared at her that she finally offered \"your food will be out in a few minutes\". When the pancakes did finally come out, the quantity was about three times that of what you'd get normally. As a result, most of our orders went to waste as we could not eat even half of it. The maids, the staff at the front desk, the doormen, etc. all were very polite and professional. I'm not really into casinos, but as far as they go, I'd say this one is probably nothing special. It didn't have that 'buzz' that many other casinos do...it seemed a bit 'depressing'. As for the hotel's fitness center, the equipment they had there was pretty good. They had a wide variety of machines and free weights, and everything seemed to be in good condition. They also had some yoga mats, elastic bands, large balls, etc. Downsides to the fitness center were the fact that the 'steam room' didn't seem to have any steam. While I DID see indications on the wall from where steam would normally come, I never did see the steam come out, NOR did I see any kind of switch to turn the steam on/off. As for the sauna, while it was nice enough, there was no traditional wooden bucket with a spoon to add water to the rocks, anywhere to be seen. The fitness center also has NO locker rooms, so if you do bring a bag with you, you must carry it around with you unless you have no valuables in it and can therefore just leave it somewhere in the fitness center. However, with no locker rooms, this also means that there is no privacy per se. If you need to change your outfit, you must do so in the one bathroom located in the fitness center. This also means a VERY bad setup if you want to shower. There are two showers in common areas in the fitness center, but with no LOCKED doors. Therefore, you are taking a risk if you shower in there, as you must figure out how to shower (in your bathing suit?....totally naked....?) and then how to manage to dry yourself off and then get dressed, all the while having no real privacy since there are no locked doors in the shower or an attached locker room. On my last day there, and after having already checked-out of my room, I ended up showering in the fitness center in my bathing suit. I then had to step out of the shower, pat myself dry, then walk THRU the gym in my bathing suit, and then continue on to the one bathroom there, in order to finish drying and change into my clothes. NOT a great system. The fitness center did have plenty of towels on-hand but no staff person on hand to assist you with anything..... The 'business center' at this place was self-serve. You enter using your room key. They then have individual workstations with a phone and computer, and use of a network printer. To use the computer you must swipe your credit card. (I had to pay about $15 to use the computer for 15 minutes.) There was no staff person on-hand to assist with anything..... As for the location of this hotel, it was 'ok'. In the immediate area, the feeling of the neighborhood is a bit strange....like it is 'in flux'. You'll see a very basic neighborhood restaurant here and there followed by a number of clearly unoccupied/abandoned buildings. Further along the main street heading East I think, things pick up, and you'll see some other nice restaurants and fancy designer shops. (It seems that they tried the 'if you build it they will come' mentality, but that 'they' have yet to come. It seems the current economy has stagnated things resulting in a bit of a depressed feeling along parts of this main street....) One good thing about this area is that it's half-way between Old San Juan and Isla Verde/Carolina, which are two nice areas to check out..... We discovered a really good restaurant that was about a 10-15 minute walk from the hotel called Buddatai. We liked it so much we ate there on three separate occasions. It's upscale pan-asian cuisine.... I should also mention that...I'm not sure if it was the time of year and/or the fact that this hotel was surrounded by water on both sides but...the humidity level in the room was quite strong.....our bedsheets always felt damp...it was THAT humid. If we left the balcony door open for more than say 15 minutes, the floor would actually become SLICK from all the humidity.... As a result, we found sleeping to be very uncomfortable...even with the A/C on, the bed always felt 'damp' ergo rather 'gross'.....", "Date": "May 4, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "4.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Washington DC, District of Columbia", "Title": "\u201cNot Bad Conrad\u201d", "Author": "rsample34", "ReviewID": "UR63227818", "Content": "Rooms were a bit small, but the lobby, pool, casino, facilities and balcony were all very, very solid.

We had a wonderful time and were really happy with the hotel and its services/staff/amenities! We chose this hotel because of its Condado location and offerings of restaurants, a casino, proximity to things to do and ocean views. Normally when we travel, we choose VRBO properties because of the value and ability to have a kitchen, etc. - but we wanted to have a hotel with amenities for our honeymoon. Condado Plaza was a great choice, and we were not disappointed. The room was really comfortable - the bed and pillows were great! The bathroom had plenty of space. We had an ocean view room, and loved hearing the waves crash below! The only thing we can say is that we do wish there were more restaurants within walking distance - but that is nothing against the hotel. The Starbucks next to the hotel is really nice - we were able to grab coffee/breakfast before our excursions. We found some great restaurants in Old San Juan, and enjoyed the restaurant Veritas at the hotel (good food and service here!). All the staff we encountered - from front desk to bartenders to casino staff - were really nice. Personally, I did not have a problem with the resort fee - there were lots of nice amenities included at the hotel for this fee (ex. free wireless - which I don't often find in higher end hotels). Another thing we liked was that the housekeeping staff seemed very aware of waiting until we had left for the day to bring towels/clean. We did not have the problems that some of the reviewers mentioned - so I would not hesitate staying in this hotel again at all. I would also suggest, as other reviewers have, that Jose Padin (Director of Operations) is very helpful if you have any questions at all! Overall, we spent some time around the hotel (casino, restaurants, etc.) but also went to other parts of the island and San Juan area. We went to the forts, spent a day Tarpon fishing, went to El Yunque/Luquillo Beach, and just walked around Condado.

We booked our stay with Hilton points. Being Diamond, we got upgraded to an ocean view room from the main hotel (see important fact below). That was very nice! Check in was very very inefficient. We had had trouble getting to SJ because of the ashes and our luggage got lost, we were hoping to at least be able to get our room quickly. But no, 3 girls were at the reception desk, but preferred to talk to each other instead of helping the people waiting... When we finally were able to check in, we were told that our room would only be ready in a couple of hours. When we finally got our room, there were no towels and no toiletries (got fixed by calling housekeeping) This actually seems to be a problem: on day 2 and 4, toiletries were not replenished and on day 3, no towels again (they didn't leave the dirty ones, no no, they took them but didn't put new ones) When you do get toiletries, the size is pretty big which is nice knowing how much conditionner one needs at the beach. There was no tub, just a big shower (glass). The room has modern furnishing. It has tile floor, which I really really like in warm, beachy places: easy to sweep and clean. Elevators: waow, what a pain! There are 2 located in the middle that are supposed to porvide service for the whole place. Let me tell you, you will wait, you will stop at every level, and they will be packed. There is another one at the end near the pool. Breakfast: Ridiculous! We are Diamond for Hilton and Gold for Marriott, we spend our lives in hotels. Every where we go, we get free breakfast which includes eggs, smoked salmon, yogurt, fruits... including top of the chain hotels in major cities of the world. But not at the SJ Conrad: we got coupons for breakfast for 8 dollars... which get you coffee or tea and just plain toast at the hotel?! That's a joke. The good thing is the coupons work at a *bucks located at the hotel, so we were able to get a decent breakfast, but definitely not at the hotel. We had breakfast at the hotel on our last day: Lobster egg benedict, that was pretty good. Parking: parking is ok. Except that one night, we saw the sign \"parking full\", so we went to the valet and asked where we can park, he said \"accross the street\". Ok, we started the car again and saw that the guy slowly walking to the signs and removing it! (but didn't tell us, of course). So, we decided not to try accross the street and try the real parking: it was not even half full! ( we had rented a car to do the rain forest and drive around to other nices beaches with waves) Location: this is neither Old San Juan nor the heart of Condado. You can walk to SJ, but that's a long walk and one might not feel safe all the time (we didn't). You can take the bus, but apparently, the schedule is a joke, expect to wait. Have the exact fare for each passenger, otherwise, you won't be able to get in, and if you waited, that sucks. Beach: there is a small public beach that you can access from the pool area. It's public, but you can get lounge chairs and towels from the hotel. But there are rocks, it's not that great. You can walk to Condado beach, which is much nicer and has waves (but there are some areas with algae) Anothyer very important fact: the Conrad used to be accross the stree (not the sea side), but bought a Radisson (?) to claim ocean view. Both buildings are accross the street and connected via a pedestrian covered bridge. If you are unlucky and get to stay on the wrong side of the street, you will get a nice view of the street (or marina) and enjoy traffic. That might not be what you expected. So we have mixed feelings about this place. It's renovated, looks modern and trendy, but service is not quite there yet. I guess it depends what you are up to: nightlife and restaurants, then, no, stay in the Heart of Condado/ nice beach: choose a resort (but be ready to have an all inclusive package or be ripped off for food and drinks)/ a nice hotel to stay at for just 1 night before a cruise, yes, ok.", "Date": "April 3, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Sleep Quality": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Stamford, CT", "Title": "\u201cDo not stay here in Puerto Rico\u201d", "Author": "arasmc", "ReviewID": "UR60028390", "Content": "I was told that the Conrad was the upper end of the Hilton line, but if this is the case.

While the lobby is decent looking, it is not impressive. We arrived well after check in time, and not only was a room not ready, (we had to wait nearly an hour) but when we finally arrived at our room, the ceiling was leaking. We called and we were able to receive a different room. The desk apologized and actually brought us the key cards to our room (which I would think would be required). There are many pictures on the website indicating that the rooms have balconies, which while technically true, only those that appear to face the ocean actually have room enough for a chair or two. Our room faced the other tower on the street, and it provided very little opportunity to enjoy. Overall, I think the website needs to be far more truthful regarding the balcony. As far as the room itself, we had a suite, and thought it was very similar to many of the suites at other Hilton hotels. However, the shower head is built for people under 5'7\", and there is a lack of a fan in the bathroom, which explains why the paint was peeling near the shower. It appears that the remodel ignored these issues. In addition, we had to request toliet paper on two different days because the maids forgot to restock. How is that possible? And why isn't there a toliet paper holder in this hotel? And if the Condado claims to be a luxiury hotel, why don't they provide robes in the room? The towels are very small, perhaps they think only small children stay there. The food was ok, and the casino, while tauted as one of the best on the island, looked eeriely similar to the casino from the movie Swingers that Mikey and Double Dog go to at the beginning of the movie, including the patrons. Breakfast was decent, but overall the food was nothing spectacular. Overall, I think this hotel is attempting to classify itself in a category this is not merited. We did not receive a discount for the leaking room, perhaps I should have pressed them. I guess in the end, how is it possible that if check in time is 2pm, and we arrive after check in time, the room is not ready? I am not the only reviewer to complain of this reality. If you want to stay here, request a room in the main tower and request one with a real balcony. Others have echoed that the Condado is a dicey neighborhood, and I would disagree. We ate dinner several nights on Ashford and found it to be extremely safe and lively.

Unfortunately, for the 2 nights we were at the hotel, there wasnt much activity at the bar (there were a couple of people having drinks but definitely not a happening place), which was disappointing. The hotel is conveniently located in Condado, and a short drive to Old San Juan. The hotel has a couple of swimming pools, but I would definitely not recommend this property to anyone seeking a pure beach resort experience. The hotel is on the ocean, but has a very small beach which is actually on the bay with views of buildings in San Juan. The rooms have been updated but are definitely worn (there is white tile in most of the room/bathroom, and the white is definitely looking dirty due to wear/tear). Furthermore, housekeeping does a very average job of cleaning the rooms. For example, we spotted some leftover hair from previous guests when looking around the room/bathroom. Our biggest issue with the property was the thin walls between rooms. We stayed at the property during Spring Break period, and were woken up throughout the night by yells, screams, and knocks by Spring Breakers staying in rooms around us. Definitely not ideal for what we hoped would be a relaxing holiday. Finally, the hotel's staff were not too helpful. While they did give us a complimentary upgrade to an ocean view room, the concierge desk could use some better training. On my first day at the hotel, I asked the concierge for directions to Old San Juan, and he gave a very terse response (as if it was an effort to give directions to a guest). I continued to ask whether they had any recommendations for where to park, and his only response was \"here is the map... there are garages for parking.\" Definitely not the detailed answer with specific suggestions on preferred garages which I was looking for.

Look no further!\u201d", "Author": "dspny", "ReviewID": "UR58472433", "Content": "This is our 2nd trip to the Conrad Condado Plaza since January. My wife and I had another wonderful vacation here at the Condado Plaza. We are here on a quick four night stay. Being from NY and just shoveling out from quite a blizzard we knew it was time to thaw out at this wonderful hotel. I will try to paint an accurate portrait of the hotel and the neighborhood so you can come to your own conclusions. Let me say this at the outset for my fellow Northeasterners: If you have not considered Puerto Rico as a fabulous destination in the Caribbean you need to consider this island. We have cruised extensively in the Caribbean stopping at many islands. Puerto Rico has many advantages over the more conventionally thought of islands. First is its size. There are many areas to explore including historic forts, a rain forest, Old San Juan, which you already know about if you have taken a cruise that stopped here, and many other activities to participate in if you are so inclined. You can also just relax and let your cares and worries melt away. Being part of America, T-mobile treats it as if I were home. That alone is a huge advantage for road warriors who do not quite know how to leave their work at home. The hotel also has complimentary wireless that is accessible in the rooms. Still an uncommon amenity. Add in excellent hospitals, professional police and extensive public transportation. The Condado Plaza was built in the early sixties and has changed hands several times since then. From independent owners to large chains it finally found itself owned by Conrad and thus is part of the Hilton family. I have just returned from two + hours swimming in one of the three pools the property boasts. In my case it was the saltwater pool. That was after floating in the lagoon and reading a book in one of the many comfortable deck chairs by the pool. The hotel consists of two buildings connected by an enclosed walkway over Ashford Avenue on the Mezzanine floor, one up from the lobby. The main tower, 10 stories has the lobby, 2 bars, a gift shop, and area for receptions or business meetings and a covered yet open to the air very large \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcpatio\u00e2\u20ac\u2122. The d\u00c3\u00a9cor is Caribbean modern with lots of bright colors and glass. There are three views available. Ocean view is just that. As opposed to other hotels this hotel parallels the ocean so the rooms really face the ocean. Unlike hotels we have all seen that are built 90 degrees to the ocean and the ocean view rooms do have a view of the ocean \u00e2\u20ac\u201c if you are willing to crane your neck to see it. Not only are the Ocean view rooms truly that, they include a wonderful, large balcony. If you like the roar of the ocean and the smell of the sea this is your hotel. The city view is the view from each building facing the other. If you like to see cars and people walking choose this. It would be my last choice. The lagoon view is good, overlooking a lagoon and beyond that, San Juan. It is quite nice to look at San Juan especially at night. Two of the three pools ( 1 salt water, 1 with a swim up bar) are outside the main tower. The second building has the third pool, a gym and a very powerful medium \u00e2\u20ac\u201c large whirlpool tub inside near the gym. Both buildings have heated gentle jacuzzi pools of average size. Do not think swimming pool size here. Normal hot tub size, maybe 10 people. All the pools are clean and attractive. To lay by a pool with Palm trees overhead and the ocean breeze blowing is worth the price of admission alone. The 2nd building also has a nice casino. The rooms, like the lobby are brightly colored with a clean modern look. The beds are comfortable and you will certainly get a restful night of sleep at the Condado Plaza. The bathrooms need to be seen. Glass walled showers. The hallways to the rooms are nicely carpeted and in good shape. Before I wrote this I read some recent reviews. One woman spoke of cracks in tiles in an elevator. Remember this is our 2nd trip here and I did not notice the crack(s) until I read that. They are on the floor in one elevator and are minor. In fact I asked Jose whose was referenced in that review and the hotel has replacement tiles already. It is just a matter of waiting for a slower time to take an elevator out of service for a day. Jose Padin is the director of Operations for the hotel. Quite simply he is as competent a professional as you will find in the hotel business. Jose is the Director of Operations for the Hotel and he is in a word the best. As far as other complaints I read about, mold in the bath room, etc. I have found none of it. I cannot say it does not exist but I am a picky traveler and looked at a few rooms before deciding on the ones we stayed in. Perfectly clean. Neighborhood: Condado had fallen on hard times in the last decade or so, no doubt. However there is a bout of a renaissance occurring. Many of the high rise apartment/condos are new while others look a touch shabby and need work. There are a lot of charming houses in the area as well as the high rises. As the previous reviewer said the sidewalks in areas could use improvement but it is not that big an issue. We feel safe walking to the center of Condado and thoroughly enjoy our walks. There are many restaurants in the area (as well as in the hotel) and some of them have really good food. Location: The Conrad is located to the far west of Condado. This has its good and bad. It does make the hotel a 15 minute walk to the center but there are many interesting establishments along the way from restaurants, shopping, bars, etc. Also, being near the bridge there is less traffic and if you chose to walk to Old San Juan, 45-60 minutes it can be done. All in all, the Condado Plaza is a wonderful, restful, beautiful hotel. You cannot go wrong here.", "Date": "March 13, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "3.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "pennsylvania", "Title": "\u201cOk, but there are better for less money\u201d", "Author": "nikkidad", "ReviewID": "UR58441933", "Content": "First the good. Nice lobby, wonderful customer service at check in. Our first night, we were awakened by the sound of our neighbors returning to their room at 4 am. Not so bad..., second night however, we were again awakened, and this time the noise did not end. Called security and the noise abated immediately, for a little while. Complained at the desk the next day and were moved to another room, but it took them about 8 hours to do it. The drinks/food at this hotel were quite expensive for the quality. The weather was not cooperating so we ate at Cafe Caribe, Varitas, and Pikayo during our stay. Food at Cafe Caribe was no better than any chain hotel fare. Varitas, the food was ok, not memorable at all. The food at Pikayo, which I was so looking forward to, (Wilo Benet), was disappointing. Housekeeping: First room, wonderful, Second room, not so good. Replaced the coffee and the towels, but no cleaning could be discerned. We had no car with us, but the bus was easy enough to use. Pic ks you up right in front of the hotel. Bring quarters, as the bus only accepts change. Casino is small, but serves its purpose. Beach is terrible. Very small, public, and sits next to the road/bridge. Not so clean. There are better in San Juan. Lots of airport noise. The hotel is directly in the flight path of the local small airport. Not a great place to fall asleep at the pool. I had read reviews of this hotel and one of them said that the hot tub was too hot. I thought that perhaps that was untrue. Well, the hot tub is so HOT that you can barely sit in it. You could make tea with that water. I like my hot tub water hot, but this was extreme. Old San Juan was wonderful. Go to \"Le Cafe Puerto Rico\". We would have passed up this gem but the concierge recommended it and actually ordered food for his lunch once he thought of it. The food is fantastic, reasonable and the wait staff very friendly. La Bombanerra was also a great place to eat truly authentic Puerto Rican food. Hotel charges 7.50 US for 15 minutes in the business center. In this day and age, that is ridiculous.

When we got to our room it was right near the elevators. I was willing to stay just the one night then switch to a room further down the hall from the elevators but it was never necessary. I only heard some hallway noise one time and that was from the room next door, not actually the hallway (they slammed their door many times in a row at 6:00am for some unknown reason). The folks at the casino were great, although I would have enjoyed winning more than losing. The numerous pools were clean and refreshing. Although there were really huge waves when we were on this trip the small beach adjacent to the property was just fine for a quick swim or dip. We found the restaurant across the street (Puerto Rican Fire Grill) to be fairly expensive for what you got, and the quality of the food to be so-so, but the other meals we had in the hotel restaurants were fine. We had a Vista room on the 6th floor and just loved the view, both morning and night. The hotel was located in an area on the local bus route so we saved a ton of money by taking the bus for 75 cents to Old San Juan and the forts. We walked down the road the hotel was located on and found a few gift shops, a pharmacy, some souvenoir shops and some local restaurants. The only weird thing about the room was the fact that the shower was in the middle of the bathroom and enclosed in glass. This meant that only one of us could shower, use the sink, have access to our clothes, and use the bathroom at a time. I kept my clothing and suitcase in the room on the suitcase stand and my friend kept her clothing in the closet in the bathroom. I guess when they designed the rooms they thought more of a couple vs. 2 friends staying there.

But again is in need of TLC -- the picture headboard was streaked and in need of a clean, there's mold and mildew around the grouting in the shower, the shower door didn't close properly so there was water everywhere and the red walls were chipped. That, said, though, we LOVED this hotel, but not for the price. We paid over $300 for one night and it definitely is not a $300/night hotel anymore. Food and drink prices were also insane...$19 for bacon and eggs. The Condado area, in general, saw its hayday and has now been left to rot.

I was a bit apprehensive staying here after reading some of the reviews here on Tripadvisor, but after staying there...I wondered if those people had stayed at the same hotel I had. First of all...the Ocean view room was really great. I would recommend the extra $35 of so dollars for the upgrade. The view and sound of the ocean made the stay special. The room was very 'cool', clean and comfortable. The bed was one of the most comfortable hotel beds I have slept in years. The towels were very fluffy, and the size of the room was good. There were no issues with cleanliness at all. I also loved the glass shower. Everyone at the hotel was pleasant and helpful. I saw no rudeness exhibited by any hotel employee I encountered, as others on TA had experienced. I liked the location of the hotel, near the end of Condado. We like to walk to restaurants at night, and the location was 1 to 15 minutes to many of the restaurants in the Condado area. There are some abandoned buildings in the area as others have said....but from what I saw, that was the case in a lot of the San Juan area. I did not fell unsafe at all walking. If you are expecting a \"Disneyland' everything is perfect kind of atmosphere, then San Juan is probably not for you. San Juan looks to be a city in transition. Not to say there are not beautiful things to see in San Juan, far from it, but it is a real place which I appreciated. (Old San Juan is a real gem) The beach is small as reported, but very nice and the waters calm, compared to the main Condado beach. The two pools were both well maintained and attractive. The cocktail service in the pool area was friendly and efficient. I also appreciated the hammocks on the large grassy area next to the ocean. Very relaxing. If you are expecting the Ritz, you may not like the Conrad. But, you are only paying at least half of what you would at the Ritz. For the money, I feel the Conrad gave us a great vacation.

If you take a cab make sure to ask ahead of time what it should cost - If you walk down Ashford watch out for missing sewer and water plate covers! And watch all the cracked sidewalks!!

There were plenty of restaurants within walking distance that allowed us to try the local cuisine and other alternatives.

Food/drink wise, like all the other nearby hotels, food and drinks are pricey. Order a few beers at a bar or restaurant with a friend and you'll have a decent tab running pretty quickly. Now lets talk food. The Conrad has three or four restaurants. One a bit upper scale but the others somewhat more reasonable with one exception. The upper scale Piyako's is nice but its too pricey for the experience. Again if you are on a roll through money vacation it wont probably bother you. Another place to mention: their asian based restaurant: called Nine. But that's in name only. As it's not much of a restaurant if atmosphere matters to you. As Nine is simply a sushi like bar and a few tables with chairs alongside the hotel's entire casino. When you sit at Nine you share the ambiance of twenty to thirty slot machines and all the noise the comes from the casino. Nine is VERY expensive and an even worse a bad value. Its extremely overpriced for the quality and menu. Unless you like burning fifty dollar bills stay away from Nine. The only pleasure you may get from it is the smile of the 4-6 Chinese waitresses with the incredible tip you're going to pay her after you see your tab. There's much better options for Japanese food. One very close to the hotel. Back to the hotel. The rooms are nice. The nightly turn up service deserves praise if you don't mind your door being knocked on between 5-7PM. The room's FREE internet service is very good. The separate bathroom with the glass enclosed shower is a nice touch. Complaints: the air conditioning always made the room feel cold whenever it came on regardless of the setting. A c ouple of times over three weeks the faucet water in the room was brown and had a bad odor. I had to run the water for like 15 minutes to get clear water. No in room microwave was disappointing. Lastly the location. On that side of Condado there's just not a lot of dining options. There is a Chilis and another higher end place next to it. A couple of beach front bar/restaurants and one other higher end place but the other side of Condado has much better options, I do not care to drive in San Juan. So walking distance places matter a lot to me after the rental car is parked for the day. In summary the San Juan Conrad is a overall nice place. It has plenty of options and distractions for a short visit. It's business model plays upon tourists that want to have fun and not worry as much about their wallets as they enjoy themselves. But if I had to stay again I'd probably stay on the other side of Condado at the Marriott.", "Date": "February 20, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "2", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "1", "Sleep Quality": "2", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "Long Beach", "Title": "\u201cDon't stay here!\u201d", "Author": "ConnieLongBeach", "ReviewID": "UR56602181", "Content": "My husband and I stayed at the Conrad after a caribbean cruise...Celebrity Summit...wonderful cruise and ship!

Looking at the pictures online it looked to be every bit a 4-5 star hotel as advertised. However, I would say it is more like a 3 star hotel, with a 5 star price tag. Our room was decorated nicely, and the bed was pretty comfortable. We had a City Vista room view which was essentially a view of the street below and the other hotel tower. We could see the bay and the the ocean down the street from our balcony, but it definitely wasn't a very great view. With the street right below, our room was very noisy at night. There would be a traffic jam every night from 8pm - 12am and the locals love to blare their radios, which I don't mind except when I am trying to sleep. I'm not a late night person so I like to unwind around 11:00. The lobby of the hotel was nice and the pools were nice. The beach was ok, but I knew that before we went so it wasn't anything unexpected. The hotel advertised a live DJ every Friday and Saturday, but it was actually just a CD that was playing all Spanish music. We never actually saw a live DJ or live Band. So that was disappointing. I would tell anyone who is going to stay here, don't waste your time or money with food or drinks at the hotel. I had one mojito by the pool and it cost $10.50. My husband and I wanted to get some beers from the hotel shop and found that they were $4.99 per bottle and they do not sell them by the six pack. Room service prices were outragous. $19 per person for breakfast that included 2 eggs, choice of meat, potatoes and toast. Coffee was $6 per person. And the hotel provides a bottle of Fiji water in your room for the bargain price of $7. So needless to say we did not eat at the hotel. Wendy's, Subway, Chili's and a bunch of other restaurants are within a 10 minute walk from the hotel. Starbucks is across the street and there is a liquore store right down the street. We ate out and bought pop, beer, water, and snacks for the room. This saved us a couple hundred dollars easily. We did eat at Varita (a restaurant in the hotel) on Valentine's day. It was $90 for 2 people. The entrees come with 1 side, no salad, no bread, no nothing. We had 1 appetizer, 2 entrees, and 2 drinks for $90. The food was good, but overpriced for what you get. We went to Old San Juan which was absolutely beautiful. To see the both fortresses is only $5 per person and just breathtaking. I highly recommend doing this. Also if you plan to do any ziplining or other excursions, do your research before you go. The conceires desk tried to charge $20 more per person for a zip line tour that we wanted to do. We didn't end up doing it because they didn't have anything available for the times we wanted to go. But none-the-less, I had done my research and called the woman out on the overpricing that she was quoting. She didn't have anything to say, she stuttered and stammered for a minute and then tried to sell us on a different tour. Which we did not end up doing. Overall, we had a good trip because we laugh at the small stuff and enjoy our time away from the cold weather. I wouldn't classify this hotel as a total waste because it was visually appealing, but still left much to be desired. It's definitly not worth the amount of money you pay to stay there. I have traveled all over the caribbean and stayed at all-inclusive resorts that there 3-4 times nicer than this hotel and paid the same amount of money.

I would agree with others in that this is no higher than a 4.0 star hotel as indicated by the Trip Advisor rating. Many of the weekend guests are 1-night only cruise goers departing the next day (either Sat or Sun) so there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s no real time to fix an issue that someone might have with their room. The Conrad was booked to capacity for the weekend as were other 3 and 4 star hotels which range from $200-$350/night. I am a Hilton Honors member, so generally stay at Hampton Inns and Homewood Suites on business and then use my points for either Embassy Suites or Doubletree hotels along the Florida east coast a couple times a year. We wanted to get away for a long weekend although only just planned it a week in advance and decided to travel to San Juan. The Doubletree was my first choice as it was rated #2 on Trip Advisor, although when I learned they don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have balconies (a must for my fianc\u00c3\u00a9) I looked elsewhere. The two Caribe Hilton\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s and the Conrad all have balconies but were completely booked so I waited another day and the Conrad opened up. I was a little concerned by the recent negative posts, and so as he suggests, I contacted Jose Padin (Dir of Ops) and he said that any issues noted in past reviews had been resolved and that we should contact him directly on his mobile if we had any problems during our stay so I booked our weekend at the Conrad with full expectation of being satisfied with the decision, and in the end, we clearly were as I had no reason to call him, other than to say thank you! One of the \u00e2\u20ac\u015310 ways you know you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re in Puerto Rico\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd is that everyone claps upon the plane touching down at the airport so don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be surprised when that happens. As this was our first visit to Puerto Rico and I only had the Trip Advisor posts to go on, I wanted to provide a more detailed review of the hotel and area to help others and so did a little more walking around then I perhaps normally would have at a hotel. Timezone - Puerto Rico is on Atlantic Standard Time (AST) and does not employ daylight savings time so from May-Oct is on the same time as the east coast, and 1 hour ahead from Nov-April. Taxi - As noted, taxi rides are relatively expensive for the shorter distances, although if you don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have a rental car, they really are the best way to travel. The ride from the airport to the hotel is about 10-15 minutes and will run $20 (includes fare, baggage, and tip). The ride to Old San Juan will run about $12 for a 5 minute trip, although can be walked in about 35-40 minutes. Check-In - There were lots of folks checking in around 5pm although with about 8 folks at the front desk, we only waited line about 5 minutes. Hotel \u00e2\u20ac\u201c The Conrad is made up of two towers. The Front Desk is located in the lobby of the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Beach\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd tower which has 10 floors and includes the casino and a couple restaurants (Caf\u00c3\u00a9 Caribe/Gusto D\u00e2\u20ac\u2122Italia, Pikayo) on the Mezzanine level along with the Casino. The Caf\u00c3\u00a9 Caribe (which doubles as the Gusto D\u00e2\u20ac\u2122Italia at night) offered a great view of the ocean while eating breakfast in the morning. You either get an \u00e2\u20ac\u0153ocean view\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd or a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153city view\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd room (although to actually see the city, rather than the balconies of the Laguna tower rooms, you would want to be on either the 9th or 10th floor as the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Laguna\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd tower is only 8 floors. Better yet, pay the additional $50+ and get an \u00e2\u20ac\u0153ocean view\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd room if available as the view is well worth the extra expense. If I couldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have gotten an \u00e2\u20ac\u0153ocean view\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd room, my next choice would have been a Laguna view as you can see the city skyline at night). The Laguna tower (across the street) is connected to the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Beach\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd tower by an indoor crosswalk on the Mezzanine level that takes you right past the Casino. You either get a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Laguna view/city skyline)\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd or \u00e2\u20ac\u0153street view\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd (looking at the Beach tower building). It is only a few minute walk from the Laguna elevators to the Caf\u00c3\u00a9 Caribe or to the Beach tower pool side dining area as well. The Laguna tower houses the Veritas restaurant and gym on the Lobby floor. The two tennis courts, kayak and paddleboat rental (on right side of the building) are both located at the Laguna tower as well. While walking through both towers, at no time did I notice any \u00e2\u20ac\u0153damp/musty\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd smell as was reported in another post. Room \u00e2\u20ac\u201c We walked in to our room about 5pm, the supervisor was just finishing up with her inspection. We stayed in an \u00e2\u20ac\u0153ocean view\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd room on the 8th floor which was very clean and gave us a wonderful view of the ocean and nearby Hilton Caribe hotels. As we were celebrating my fianc\u00c3\u00a9\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s recent graduation from full time graduate school (not having had a vacation for the past 2 years because of her studying on the weekends), Jose Padin was kind enough to have a complementary bottle of wine and two glasses waiting for us in the room. Very nice! Thanks Jose! The waves crashing on the rocks was very soothing, especially at night. I am a very light sleeper and although awoke a couple times by loud folks in the hallway, quickly fell back to sleep in the very comfortable king sized bed. Although I generally turn the fan to ON (vice AUTO) to drum out hallway noise when I stay at hotels, I didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t bother this time so we could get the full ocean wave effect. There is plenty of space in the room and the L shaped couch is a nice feature (not being night folks we watched the Olympics in the room at night). The balcony is very private and has two chairs and a table for enjoying your morning coffee (which was Puerto Rican and quite good actually). The room was very clean and everything appeared fairly new. The two robes and slippers were nice to stroll around the room in when relaxing. The bathroom is huge and has sliding doors for privacy if someone is in the shower and privacy is needed. The only nits we had with the room was the lack of towel racks (as I prefer to hang up and use the same towels for a short stay rather than getting them laundered every day) as well as the inability for the curtain to fully retract as it blocked the ocean view from the couch. I resolved that by taking a belt and wrapped it around the curtain to pull it back further. Both wired and wireless internet access was available in the room with no issues when using either method. Bus - There is a bus stop in front of the hotel just at the entrance to the beach and for only $0.75 is a good deal IF you have the time to wait or IF you get lucky and happen to get there shortly before the bus arrives. The bus is apparently more reliable on business week days rather than on weekends so remember that should you decide to take the bus. Although the bus is supposed to come every 30 minutes, there is no route information at the bus stop, so you have no clue when it will come next. We initially were going to take the bus to Old San Juan, but after waiting 10 minutes opted to just walk as it was a nice morning. The walk was about 40 minutes, although we walked along the shoreline to get the great view of the water. Although my fianc\u00c3\u00a9 wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t too excited with the idea, I wanted to experience a bus ride (so we could report back to you folks) so we did take the bus back to the hotel. The bus terminal is located near Pier #3. Although the bus we eventually took was sitting in the terminal (sans driver) the whole time, we waited about 40 minutes for it to depart which then took about 15 minutes to return to the hotel as it goes to the convention center first. Lesson learned: If you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re on vacation and want to spend more time at the hotel rather than in a bus terminal, pony up for the taxi fare. Street \u00e2\u20ac\u201c The neighborhood isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t much to look at (although not really noticeable when walked at night), although there are several souvenir shops and quite a few small and larger sized restaurants within 10-20 min walking distance. We opted to eat dinner at one of the smaller street restaurants for our first night and then ate at the Veritas (inside the hotel) the second night. We felt very safe walking on the street at night as there are lots of people walking around especially from the other hotels further down the street. There is a liquor store about a 10 minute walk from the hotel where we picked up another bottle of wine for the 2nd night. A bit further down was a Walgreens/food store as well. Beach \u00e2\u20ac\u201c Although a public beach, this is only accessible by walking as there is no close by parking, so we didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t really notice any locals on the beach (other then a couple food vendors). The hotel guests are given a colored wrist band when picking up towels to distinguish you from the locals for easy access back to the hotel grounds (a security guard is posted there). There is plenty of room on the beach, although the majority of the hotel guests utilized the pool area both days of our stay. Having to pay $20 for an umbrella and two chairs at hotels along the Florida coast, it was nice that the only cost was $11 for the umbrella for the day, although there is plenty of shade if you don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t want to use an umbrella. There are 30 buried small roughly 3\u00e2\u20ac\u2122x3\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 manmade \u00e2\u20ac\u0153reef modules\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd (mostly on the left side of the beach close to the street) where you can generally find colorful Caribbean fish swimming around. We generally bring our own snorkel/fins when we travel to a beach area, although as the hotel equipment is new US Diver gear, were we to do it again, would just pay the $11/hr (snorkel/fins) charge as you can pretty much see all there is to see in about 45 minutes. Pools \u00e2\u20ac\u201c There are two pools: (1) freshwater (large) and (1) saltwater (small) at the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Beach\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd tower, with a smaller freshwater pool in the back of the Laguna tower as well. All three were well kept and very clean with no notice of algae buildup. The \u00e2\u20ac\u0153pool bar\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd was packed both afternoons. There are (4) hammocks that get set up on the lawn area during the day, although were generally occupied most of the time. Expect lounge chairs to be a premium on the weekends. As the majority of adults had a small plastic drink cup, clearly the cost was not an issue. Most noticeable were the buckets of local 10oz Medalla beer ($20/6) around the main pool and pool bar. They go down real easy, especially on a normal San Juan tropical day so be careful. As you exit the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Beach tower\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd the towel/snorkeling gear check out is just off to the right on the ground level. Casino - The best part of the casino is that it (as with the hotel and restaurants in Puerto Rico are smoke free). Although having craps and black jack tables in the center of the casino, the perimeter of the room is made up primarily of penny and nickel slots and although not busy during the day, it is packed with the locals at night. My fianc\u00c3\u00a9 had never played the slots before so played a penny slot for about 30 minutes starting with $5 and walking away with $6, unfortunately not scoring the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153big win\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd she had hoped for, although what can you expect from a penny slot? She still had fun. Gym - The gym is open 24 hours/day and is located on the lobby level of the Laguna tower and rivals some \u00e2\u20ac\u0153strip mall\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd center gyms as it includes: (9) unique Life Fitness circuit training machines, (4) treadmills, (2) elliptical runners, (3) stationary bikes, as well as an open area for stretching/yoga with light weight dumbbells and small exercise balls. Business Center \u00e2\u20ac\u201c all services are at cost, although there are two airport boarding pass terminals to the right side of the Front Desk where you can print out your boarding pass. Although we had tried using one of them, our airline wouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t allow us to print them out for some reason, rather we had to check in at the airport. Activities \u00e2\u20ac\u201c As we were only there for the weekend, we opted to just enjoy the beach/pool area as well as walking around Old San Juan. My fianc\u00c3\u00a9 found a Segway tour on-line that provided a 2 hour tour from Pier #2 through Old San Juan up to Castillo San Felipe del Morro (a fort designated as a National Historic Site). They provide 3 daily tours, at 9am, 12pm, and 3pm taking up to 11 people at a time for $82/person. Although a bit steep, neither of us had ever been on a Segway before and thought it would be a fun way to experience the city as well as the Segway (which it was!). They were booked, so I left my name with them in case there was a cancellation while we walked around the city that Saturday morning. Jose (the owner) called us back an hour later to join them for the 12pm tour due to a last minute cancellation. There were 10 of us total with 7 of us being 50 to 60 something\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s. Although a little awkward initially, they give you a chance to get some experience on one while still at the shop. Within 5 minutes, though, you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re steering it like a pro. We split into two groups with a guide in each group. Jose was our guide. It was fun to steer the Segway and fun to see the looks on people\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s faces as we went through the city, stopping a few minutes at various spots as Jose gave us the local history. We returned to the hotel after our delightful stay in the bus terminal and grabbed our snorkel gear and headed for the beach and some sun bathing. As I indicated previously, there was plenty of room on the beach. Checking Out: Although I generally try to get a late checkout, they were too full to accommodate my request. As everyone else is checking out at the same time though, unless you are on the 10th floor, press the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153UP\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd button when heading down to the lobby otherwise, the elevator will bypass your floor, fill up at a higher floor, and be too full when it opens on your floor on the way down. So fill it up BEFORE it gets to the higher floors instead. If you have a later flight, you can check your bags at the concierge desk (although expect a line as everyone else has the same idea). Taxi\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s are plentiful (lined up waiting at the Laguna tower) so no real wait time once we decided to depart the hotel. As I hadn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t read any posts about getting to or through the airport security, we opted to return at 12:45pm for our 3:10pm flight, which turned out to be more than enough time as the taxi ride to the airport Sunday afternoon was about 15 minutes, wait at the airline counter was only 10 minutes and security took another 10 minutes. So from hotel to the gate took us about 45 minutes (depending on your airline could be longer as some counters had long wait lines from cruise folks returning home). Seating at the gates is a premium though. Just as the gates were \u00e2\u20ac\u0153standing room only\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd when we arrived, so to was it \u00e2\u20ac\u0153standing room only\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd when we departed.", "Date": "February 18, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Michigan", "Title": "\u201cWish we could have stayed longer\u201d", "Author": "screenname000", "ReviewID": "UR56366581", "Content": "We stayed here for an anniversary celebration.

I am a Diamond member and was suppose to have an upgraded room when walking to my room the cleaing staff was sitting in the hallway on the floor resting. Loved to see that. When I walked into my room I slipped on the floor. Noticed they washed the floor but never dried it. Since the cleaning staff was outside my door ask if they could dry it. It seemed the head cleaning lady came and and said they forgot to dry it. She did take care of it. Room was very small and not upgraded. Called down and they said to call tomorrow and they would have a new room for me. Yeah like I want to switch rooms. The view was bad. Looked at garbage of the hotel I think. The walls were very thin and heard loud noises all night. Decide to call the Diamond desk and they switch me to the Hilton. So glad I was able to switch the next day.

Many peope won t-shirts, Rum, travel mugs and gift basket- it was fun and festive! I really enjoyed my stay thanks to the customer service skills of the management and staff. I own a small Boutique on the CT shore and people come in this time of year looking for resort wear- when we share Caribbean destination stories- I will recommend Condado Plaza for service and value. I plan to make this long weekend and annual event. I do have one negative about my stay which the hotel has no control over- except the impression on its visitors- we walked Ashford Avenue the first afternoon- leaving the lobby the first thing we saw was the abandoned, graffittied, crumbling building next door, it made me sick to see such a sight- so sad in fact we turned around and went right back to the hotel.

We didnt count on was how expensive it would be to eat everywhere. Whether in Old San Juan or at the hotel, the prices were all very comparable. It just depends on what you have a taste for. On a whole, I would definitely recommend this hotel to others. It was very quiet, very clean and had spectacular view wherever we looked.

I have been to PR several times and have stayed at different hotels (last year at the Intercontinental Isla Verde). I was booked as part of a hotel + flight deal on expedia, so I am not sure exactly what we paid for the hotel. The hotel setting is quite beautiful, on the end of a peninsula, opening onto a large, protected bay. Because of this the waves are greatly reduced and this makes it ideal for swimming. As an avid beach person, and swimmer, this is important to me. The beach was great, quiet and quite shallow so good to be able to swim out far without any concerns. Also decent snorkeling, not amazing... It is a large hotel, and there are several nice restaurants that compare well to the local restaurants in price and quality. You can find food for less within close walking distance from the hotel. Like most travelers, we usually do a combination of nice restaurants mixed in with fast food, local cuisine, etc. Great fitness room with very hot steam, seperate sauna. Very nice facility with new machines. good equipment and we trained every day that we were there. The workout area is on par with a good healthclub. The rooms are very nice. We were upgraded on arrival to an ocean view room, which was very nice. We did also see the laguna side rooms, and they are great as well. You can't go wrong as both rooms offered a waterfront view. The bathrooms are a little akward as people have said in other rooms, but it's not really a big deal. Truth is, the bathrooms are very modern and well done from a materials / design perspective. All the amenities are there. The strange part is that they put the closet in with the shower / toilet area, in one large room. So this makes it awkward as we were traveling here for business. But we worked it out, and it really wasn't too big of a deal. The staff are very professional, everyone speaks perfect english, which was nice and helped make interactions easier. We had also had 10 boxes sent to us by ups for our meeting, and all were received no problem and they helped us unpack and load them. Our rooms were cleaned everyday, very thoroughly, which was needed as we always were needing this refresh (lots of towels, linens changed ,, etc). The pool area is great. There is a lot of space so it is easy to find a beautiful spot to chill for the day. There are also hamocks around overlooking the ocean. The pool and beach areas are very close. There are 2 pools, including a salt water pool, a hot tub - there's also a really fun little waterslide that I am not ashamed to admit I actually did a few times. I believe many of the negative reviews are from people that come to PR for one night before a cruise and have unrealistic expectations. I also believe that many people do not post something unless they had a bad experience, and I think this is unfair.

I went with my family/in laws on a caribbean cruise and decided to stay a couple of nights in San Juan. I booked the reservation on Hilton.com for 3 rooms using the advanced purchase option. I reserved 3 ocean vista rooms for about $224.00 per night, which i thought was very inexpensive. They charged my credit card for only one of the rooms (STRIKE 1) which I caught when I was checking my balance online. I contacted the hotel before I arrived and they charged me for the other two rooms. Got off the cruise ship at 9:00 am January 24 and headed to the hotel. When I checked in only one room was ready (believe me I was grateful, I know standard check in time is 3:00 or 4:00 pm) but all the rooms were in my name. I asked the front desk person if he would like the names of my guests and he just looked at me like, huh? (STRIKE 2) So whatever, we all put our luggage in the one room and went to the pool. Since mine was the only name on the rooms it was awkward getting towels because they ask for your name and room number, and charging drinks/food to room for the same reason. Again whatever, most of the family stayed at the pool, my spouse and I went to the casino. I liked the casino. Checked with the front desk around 3:00 pm and other two rooms were still not ready. Now I have dropped a significant amont of money at the casino and really want to chill in room for a while. I checked again at 4:30 and the guy at the front desk called housekeeping to see if rooms were ready, 20 minutes later he said they were ready. I got the group together and we went to the rooms. Immediately as I walk in I see a dirty towel on the floor. As I look around there is trash everywhere, dirty cups, beer bottles, bed not made, so i call the front desk, no answer. (STRIKE 3) I head back to the front desk, talk to the same guy, he sort of apologizes, and says there are no other available rooms and we would have to wait for housekeeping to clean the room. We headed back up to the room and waited another 20 minutes for housekeeping. So all in all it was about 6:00 pm when the room was ready. So after all that - I actaully liked the room a lot. I liked the contemporary look of the room. I thought the room was pretty spacious. The bathroom was nice. Bed was comfortable. And best of all, the view. The ocean view is AMAZING. It was so relaxing sitting on the large balcony watching the waves crash against the rocks. The pool area is very nice. Two pools - one freshwater, one saltwater. Lots of trees and foliage. Plenty of chairs located by the pools, on the grass, in various areas on the rocks. The beach area is small but nice. The facilities at the hotel are nice. The lobby bar is cool and fun. Japanese restaurant was good as well as room service. Casino was good. I have stayed at the following hotels an San Juan: Ritz Carlton, El San Juan, La Concha, and Marriott. I would put this hotel in the same category...for a lot less money. Here is my summary: The front desk guy really upset me a lot, however, I really liked the hotel. $200 a night is cheap for this kind of hotel.

Saturday we had a breakfast at the Cafe caribe, 4 persons, 2 eggs/meat/toats/coffee, we have waited 35 minutes before someone has welcomed us. Then, 10 minutes later we went to ask to get coffee, very bad service and bad coffee also. We've paid $ 52 ! A lady (short, young) who work at cafe caribe, was really good, did the apologise for everything.

Well I am happy to report that the staff was great and housekeeping was great too. My husband and I fell in love with Puerto Rico and the hotel stay was good and we would definitley stay here again. We arrived at 6:30 in the morning and had been so concerned that we would have to wait for a room until check in time. Well we got a room right away- and that made us very happy. The area the hotel is at is very touristy and very expensive. Old San Juan is even worse but nice to walk around and see anyways. We were on vacation and knew food can be pricey BUT we can afford it and it's not something we do all the time. I did like that we could walk around the hotel area and there are other resorts and places to eat besides at the hotel. The casino is small and I doubt ever pays out-so it is NOT worth dumping your money at. I loved the local food and eating at the local restaurants. The hotel is right on a beach BUT the area that is safe to go swim at is small and the area is rocky-so be careful. The water is nice and clear enough to go snorkeling. I would suggest bringing your own snorkeling gear instead of renting the stuff from the hotel because again it is soooo expensive. Another thing I suggest is to NOT book tours through the hotel because again they are VERY expensive! I made sure to book before we arrived in Puerto Rico. We used three different tour companies but the best by far was www.kayakingpuertorico.com. We did the rain forrest tour with the bioluminescent bay all in one day. We both loved the rain forrest and thought it was so pretty but if your not into nature and greenery then this might not be something you would enjoy. Also if you do the bioluminescent tour be for warned that you will need mosquito repellent. I was covered in mosquito bites and was MISERABLE! But it was nice kayaking at night and seeing the water glow in the night. Another tour I loved was the trip to Culebra. It was another all day adventure and so pretty. We went snorkeling and then were taken to this pretty beach named Flamenco Beach-very nice. I can go on and on about our trip. Bottom line is that the hotel was nice for what we needed and that was a clean room to sleep in and keep our things. Most of the time we were outdoors enjoying the great weather.

We narrowed our choice of hotel down to this and the Hilton Caribe (as we wanted to burn some HHonors points for this stay) and selected this one based on the reviews of the two here on Trip Advisor; we could not have been more pleased. We arrived just before 1:00 PM and had planned on having to check our bags with the concierge, changing into something more comfortable and hanging by the pool until our room was ready. However, they had a room ready for us right away. They were unable to upgrade us to an ocean view room, but did give us a suite, which we thought was a nice gesture (especially considering we did not pay for the room); having the extra room was nice, but we did not plan to spend much time in our room to begin with. In general, the room was clean, comfortable and well-appointed, and, as others have mentioned, they have made an effort to give this older hotel a more modern look. Our only improvement to this room would have been a larger balcony; the rooms in this section of the hotel had a smaller balcony which had room to stand, but no room for a few chairs, as some of the other rooms did appear to have. We spent time at both the main pools and the beach, as well as the smaller, more secluded pool in the back of the hotel. Although the public could access the resort area from the main road, the hotel's security staff ensured that non-guests were not taking amenities away from the hotel guests. There was a lot of outdoor space both in the sun and in the shade, which is always a plus for us as I like to get some sun and my girlfriend prefers to be someplace where she won't burn without applying spf 200 every 20 minutes. The only room for improvement by the outdoor areas was that there sometimes seemed to be a lack of towels available by the smaller pool on the lagoon side; something we discussed with other guests as well. Overall, this hotel was a great choice for us - nice rooms and amenities, a very helpful staff (from the maids, to the bartenders to the concierge staff) and in walking distance to some of the restaurants and shops in Condado. The few items where we noticed a bit of \"room for improvement\" were minor details and in no way detracted from our trip. We plan to go back to San Juan and will likely stay here again when we do. A few notes for future guests: 1 - There is a small market about 5-6 blocks down the street (easy walking distance) if you want to stock up on drinks or snacks for the room without paying the gift shop prices. 2 - If you want a drink inside the hotel, the bartenders at Pikayo are much more generous with their pours compared to the bar on the lobby floor. 3 - For breakfast outside of the hotel (as their cafe did run up a long wait), try Hacienda Don Jose about a block down the street (see my separate review). 4 - Other restaurants we enjoyed within walking distance: Budatai (see separate review) and Waiter's Gastropub (not currently listed on Trip Advisor; I think its brand new).", "Date": "January 1, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "2", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "1", "Location": "3", "Rooms": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "oklahoma city", "Title": "\u201ctoo much money for too little cleanliness\u201d", "Author": "panneohara", "ReviewID": "UR52271443", "Content": "I only agreed to pay $250 a night since this was the only hotel I could find for only one night on a return from a cruise.

I wish we were explained the process when we were checking in. Front desk person sent me to the bellman to get instructions and told me that parking is being taken care of by an outside company. So what? It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s still hotel facility, isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t it? Next day, we validated our ticket but again couldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t get out of the parking. The security went on telling us something about 10 minutes rule and then finally let us out. We really didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t come to Puerto Rico to study parking rituals, so it was bothersome. - Maintenance issues in the room: bathroom doors were completely off the hinges, the sink was clogged and filled with water most of the time, hot water wouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t kick in for the first 10 minutes of shower (very eco-unfriendly as we had to let the water run until it got hot), the entry door handle had a problem as well and we had to wrestle with it 6-7 times every time we wanted to get into our room. - Wireless internet \u00e2\u20ac\u201c first night it didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t work at all, I was asked by \u00e2\u20ac\u0153technical support\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd to go out on the balcony to use it. Ha ha, that was a good one. They did actually improve it for the rest of our stay, I was able to get 2 bars of signal from the far corner in the bed. - Consierge \u00e2\u20ac\u201c completely clueless when we called one night to ask for restaurant recommendations. Not only she wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t familiar with nearby dining options but she put us on hold twice and never got back to us, so we went online and took our pick. - Business services \u00e2\u20ac\u201c I needed to print out 2 pages from my flash drive. We were directed to Business Canter and then\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 asked to pay $7.50 for the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153privilege\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd of turning the computer on.

My bad, I guess? - Noodle Bar turned out to be a sad little corner tucked in behind the casino. It had an airport joint kind of feel. We wanted to eat there but went to Pikayo instead. - Aquarium in the lobby. There was a small nurse shark in it and the aquarium was TINY. Poor thing didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have space at all as the tank was filled with rocks and decorations. Bad, bad, bad.

Joey, the bartender at the pool is someone you have to see and get to know. Makes wonderful drinks and great conversation. We only ate at one of the restaurants, the Cafe Caribe, for breakfast each day, and the food and service were very good (we went elsewhere for lunch and dinner daily). The casino was fun, active all the time and cleaned constantly. The relatively small beach was in good shape and the breakwater does a nice job of keeping the waves managable. The pools were great, the main one by the bar (Joey), also has a waterslide that kids and adults will enjoy. This hotel does a lot of conference business but it never intrudes on vacationers. Some holiday parties were in evidence also, again, things ran smoothly with all of that going on. There are some very nice restaurants down the street, we recommend Ropa Vieja and Ajilli Mojilli if you are looking for local food.

The Ocean(Bahyia Vista Room) room had a completely unobstructed view of the ocean which we had the pleasure of enjoying every night with a glass of wine and every morning while sipping Pureto Rican Coffee. The sound of the waves echos all day long as they crash on the rocks. The hotel provided many lounging areas for relaxiation, several bars and fantastic resuraunts. The casino was a lot of fun, you could easly lose a couple of hours in there trying ladyluck. We were lucky enough to win enough each day to pay for all our meals. how fun is that and the drinks were outstanding. They also offer in the casino all the soda and tea you want for free at the self serve stand. I was impressed that they thought enough to even provide a stand near the entrance/exit where you could sanitize your hands. How thoughtful. The room was extremly spacious with a soft comfrotable bed. I felt the pillows were too soft, but my wife found them to be perfect. The bathroom had a glass inclosed standup shower, you could fit maybe four people in it. Didn't try that though. Pleanty of closet and drawer space as well as ample selections to watch on television. The room also was equipped with internet hook-up, not sure if there was a charge for that, we didn't surf the net but we had pleny of waves to surf on if we wanted to. The beach was rather small and not facing the ocean, but once you see the waves, you will understand why it is protecetd by a logoon. If you are not the beach going type, you were able to enjoy the multiple swimming pools that is offered and well stocked with pleanty of chairs. The food was very tastey and a nice variety to choose from. The prices are a little high but remember, you get what you pay for. Service and quality was the order of the day every day at the Conrad. The building was clean and well maintained, and the staff were always available to assist you in any way. We had the distinct pleasure of meeting and conversing with the hotel manager Mr Padine. He had a warm caring and attentive disposition. He provided us much information with regards to other areas of Puerto Rico which included Old San Juan. You have got to go visit Old San Juan if you are a shopper, Old San Juan is the place for you. Plan on spending a long day of shopping in countless stores that have everything you could hope to buy while on vacation. You will be able to find great deals on many of the items while shopping. You could take the short bus ride for .75 cents per person and the last stop at the bus terminal is where you would get off the bus for a shopping experience of a life time. There are many, many eating spots with a viriety of cusines to choose from. Every street, every corner there is something to see and marvel at. The area is rich with many historical buldings and homes that would make any camera person do cartwheels. Just a short walk from the hotel, you are able to find many other places to eat with great prices. We ate breakfast at this really great ocean front resturant everyday and paid nothing more than 25.00 dollars for a full breakfast for two which was more than filling and the flavors were marvelous. You could also find on the same street as the hotel, the typical american fast food spots as well. For the more sophistcated wonderers, there are more upscal resturans to choose from as well.

I could have done cartwheel in there if I wanted to...trust me I was tempted to! They also have several restaurants. We ate at the Varita downstairs when we first arrived and although it was a bit pricey it was worth it. The food was delicious and they had very large portions. I had the turkey BLT and it was HUGE. The size of a baby's head! Speaking of food (I shall return to my review of the hotel in a moment because I am far from done) every meal that we've experience in Puerto Rico was absolutely heavenly. In Old San Juan we had the pleasure of dining at Raices (not expensive with large portions), The Parrot Club (reasonably price with a good size portions) , and here is the big one....(drums rolling....) THE DRAGON FLY. Each and every meal was done to perfection but the meal at Dragon Fly was hands down the most memorable and absolutely delectable. Their desert was entrancing (it's the fried wonton with banana/nut filling). I didn't think it was humanly possible to drool while eating...well... I've shot that theory down that night. Although it was a bit pricey to eat at the Dragon Fly believe me...it was well worth it. Besides...if you're in Puerto Rico, you're probably on a vacation. Treat yourself! Also nearby the hotel was an great 'lil restaurant, La Hacienda with an ocean view front (not expensive at all with large portions). Picture this: waves crashing against the rocks, as the breeze blows through the window and you are in the center of all of that with perfect company (which I was privileged enough to have, thanks Troy!) and a divine meal bestowed in front of you with top notch service. Go to Puerto Rico, and that can be a reality for you. Now that I've made myself hungry back to the review of the Conrad Plaza. They also have a Casino, a hip lounge area, 2 tennis courts, and you can rent a boat and kayak in their lagoon...which our hotel room overlooked. If you want a great, serene view asked to stay in the bahia vista room on the 10th floor. We had a balcony with a perfect view, overlooking the lagoon, the tennis court and one of their pools. Could not have asked for better maid service. They ALWAYS do such a great job cleaning up the bathroom :). We order room service once and it went smoothly as well. Sites to visit: The Fortress in Old San Juan. $3 for entrance fee to see one of the Fortress. A mile away is another fortress that if my memory serves me right is another $2 or $3. My companion and I didn't go to both but we were content with just visiting that one. We also did a hiking and zip-lining tour. Shame on me for not remembering the name of the company but the Concierge Desk in the hotel has their name and number. It was $125 for a half day excursion from 9am to 12:30. It included a 15-20 minutes hike with 10 ziplining course. The last one which is half a mile long. The forest was only 20 minutes away which was perfect in comparison to some of the other companies that provided excursions that was an hour and 45 minutes or even 45 minutes away. The guides were VERY friendly and lots of fun. Now that I've written a novel I hope my review was helpful.

When the bellman brought my bags up, he brought the wrong ones. He returned a few minutes later with the correct bags and laughingly pointed to some water on the floor in my room, beneath a ceiling air conditioner access and said \"Don't worry, it's just from the air conditioner.\" There was enough water dripping that I put down 2 towels and slipped on the wet tile floor during the night. I did leave a note for housekeeping the next day. It was fixed and there were no more problems. I was happy to have that resolved but slightly disappointed that the bellman didn't offer to call housekeeping about it. Despite the A/C unit issue, the room was beautiful and spacious. It was very nicely decorated and the bathroom was huge and gorgeous with dark wood and a clear shower. A recent review poster included 2 very representative pictures of both the room and the bathroom. I was mildly disappointed that with the room I had on the 10th(top) floor, that seemed to be the only floor that didn't have balconies. I faced the city but loved the floor-to-ceiling windows and the view! I found the bed to be comfortable and believe the room to be 5 star! The pool areas were beautiful, clean, offerred plenty of seating and were very well kept. I think the pool area is one of the nicest I've seen at a resort. I was in training during the day but really enjoyed sitting by and getting in the pool in the evening. There was a minor issue one night when someone at the hotel decided that at 7.00PM they had to put the chemicals in the pool with the swim-up poolbar. There were a few people in the pool but we had to get out for a half hour due to that. That was unacceptable and there was no reason that couldn't have been done later or during the night when no one was in the pool. If you're looking for a beach, pay close attention to the pictures of the hotel. There was a small one, yes, but it was right beside a road and I think there was a bus stop right there too. It was so close to the bridge/road that they attach a rope with bouys to one of the pillars of the bridge to rope off a swimming area. I'm not sure what's happenning with the restaurants at the hotel but I was dissappointed. Prior to my trip, the hotel's website advertised a casual Italian restaurant. That had been changed to the Caf\u00c3\u00a9 Caribe. It was good for breakfast and lunch but just didn't have that upscale feel you'd want for dinner in a Conrad Hotel. There was a Strip House Steakhouse advertised on the in-room hotel guide but when I inquired at the front desk, I was told that was closed. The new rotisserie restaurant just didn't look at all upscale like the Capital Grille in the Indianapolis Conrad Hotel and I heard from someone else staying there that they were not impressed with this new restaurant. The Eight Noodle Bar was good if you like Asian cuisine. I do and enjoyed the sushi. This restaurant does look as advertised on the hotel website but it is no bigger than what you see in the picture. About 20 feet from the sushi bar is the casino. This restaurant almost reminds you of a shopping mall food court in that it is wide open with people walking by as you dine and a full view and the sound of the casino. The common areas of the hotel are very upscale and the meeting room we were in was nice - despite being very warm one day due to the A/C being serviced. Our group was disappointed in the timing of the maintenance but it was resolved the next day and perhaps the hotel didn't have a choice in the timing. I used the fitness center a couple times and found it to be adequately equipped. They could use a little better ventilation, or a couple fans, as it was quite stuffy. I loved the Starbucks that's part of the hotel. It was wonderful and I appreciated very much having that so easily accessible. Next to the Starbucks, however, was an abandoned building with graffiti on it. I know there's probably nothing the hotel can do about this, but I found it to be a negative. In one of the pictures I've attached, you can see the green awnings of Starbucks and the empty building next door. I would probably stay here again if business brings me to this area of Puerto Rico as I think a few things at the hotel may be \"in progress.\" (work being done on one of the closed restaurants, the pool slide was closed for repairs, the demonstration that was at the hotel on the day I left). If I visit for pleasure, I would stay elsewhere to have more access to beaches and fine dining.", "Date": "September 29, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Fort Lauderdale, Florida", "Title": "\u201cAMAZING HOTEL - GREAT LOCATION\u201d", "Author": "Luflorida", "ReviewID": "UR44788538", "Content": "This hotel is amazing!

First, check-in went smoothly and we were given our requested ocean view room... which honestly is the only view you should get, otherwise it is a waste of money. The city is a bit ran down and the lagoon side I've heard isn't that great... so just dish out the extra cash and upgrade. We also were told that we had an extra $100 credit to spend in the restaurant/bar/room service, which we were used and were extremely excited about... UNFORTUNATELY... (and this is a big one) they had confused our credit, which we booked through CHEAP CARIBBEAN with ORBITZ. This meant that we had to dish out the extra cash at the end of our trip, which we didn't plan on spending and the staff/management had NO SYMPATHY FOR US EITHER (too bad/so sad)!!! The only restaurant inside the hotel that is worthy of a visit is Eight Noodle... that's if you like sushi!!! If you like Italian... don't go to the hotel restaurant... the taste is very bland...go down the street to Ropa Verde (two blocks down from hotel). All the restaurants in San Juan are down about two blocks from the hotel and are absolutely fantastic and also a better deal. It is safe to go out at night, even though some of the buildings (like next door are abandoned). There are tons of joggers and people constantly out, so feel free to take a stroll in the evening. The bar at the hotel is very nice and wasn't extremely crowded... not sure if this place is for the older crowd, but very ultra modern. Most of the staff is very friendly, even though we had requested a late check out and we were denied. Also, make sure to go to Old San Juan...(take the 75 cent bus down there and back people) it is great for shopping and has excellent deals. We ate at a lovely restaurant in Old San Juan called Sofia's... it has a very romantic setting and we actually had an excellent waitress that gave us helpful hints at places to go in the evening around Old San Juan. Another thing that you must do is the rain forest adventure... (ziplining, repelling, hiking through waterfalls). We went with a group called Ecoquest and they were absolutely nice and served us an authentic Puerto Rican lunch at their house afterwards. Make sure to enjoy the workout room and the swim up bars, they weren't crowded at all. The drinks at the pool were a bit expensive, but this is vacation people, so enjoy it and have a great time!!! Make sure you bring bug spray, since they have a lot of flying biting bugs/NOT BED BUGS, which I read earlier!!! P.S.- Zen Spa is very relaxing and beautiful, if your up to it... call and make a reservation, since they normally are booked (about 3-4 blocks down from the hotel). Also, the casino is small and most people their don't speak English, so don't plan on meeting a lot of interesting people there.

We live in NYC and have traveled many times to Puerto Rico. I have also stayed in the Conrad in Miami and LOVED it! Check-in was a little slow. I was supposed to be able to have an express check-in since I logged in for it on the Hilton Honors website, but didn't see that offered. The room was a decent size and we had a wonderful balcony overlooking the ocean. The pools look great, and there seemed to be ample loungers. I was also impressed to see staff removing towels from loungers after a certain period of time. The beach is definitely NOT the most desirable compared to other San Juan resorts. It is situated on the lagoon next to a congested 2 lane bridge. My main complaints were in service. The elevators were very slow, and only two for the main tower. They were also very small and very crowded. The overall feel is much more family oriented than I expected. I was thinking it would be much more \"adult\" oriented. Every morning of our stay, a piece of paper was slid under our door around 10am. It basically stated that they were respecting our \"do not disturb\" sign and would not be cleaning our room. Not only that, but if we wanted cleaned the FOLLOWING day, we needed to call the front desk. I'm sorry, that is NOT the quality of a fine resort. I am there to relax: I don't think sleeping in until 9:30 and then having a cup of coffee and preparing for my day at a leisurely pace is out of line. I have never seen this happen in any other hotel or resort, regardless of number of stars. On check-out day, there was no summary of my account slid under the door (though they did knock, despite the Do Not Disturb sign to see if they could make up our room). The express check out kiosks also would not let me check out. The line to check out was almost out the door. I do not understand why the check-out process needs to be so tedious. I agreed with all of the charges on my account, why must I stand in a long line to verify that? All-in-all, we had a very pleasant stay and we enjoyed ourselves.

I was attending a conference here and so I booked where the conference was. The hotel is a lot bigger than I thought and it actually has two towers about eight stories. There is a walkway from one building to the other. The staff are all super friendly, from the front desk to the chambermaids, they always greeted you with a smile and a nice comment. The greetings were genuine, I never got the feeling they were forced because I was the guest. The hotel has everything you would want when visiting San Juan. Besides the casino if you are into gambling, it has three pools. Two are fresh water and one is salt water, plus there is a jacuzzi hot tub. Lots of lounge chairs and it has a bar area in the pool. The hotel also sits beside a nice public beach. It isn't very big but for me it was a great size. The beach is on a lagoon so it is protected from the huge ocean waves that can happen. Again this is my preference. The staff will also get you a lounge chair and umbrella and take it to the beach for you. For the kids there is a water slide and inflatable beach toys to use. The room I stayed at was one of the inside rooms so I didn't get a city or ocean view but I didn't mind this (it was cheaper). But, it did have a balcony and I could see the ocean and beach from there. The room was very clean and very modern. The bed was one of the most comfortable beds that I have ever slept on in a hotel. It also had an in-room safe, LCD television, fridge and high speed wireless internet etc. The hotel backs onto the ocean and the views are spectacular. The grounds are immaculate and the hotel is very clean. There are a few restaurants within this hotel and I ate at all of them. A little pricey but not bad at all. The service is impeccable. What didn't I like, well I am being really picky here, but the television reception is terrible within the whole hotel which is surprising since they have such nice televisions. Second the phone system needs major work. It was almost impossible to phone another room or have someone phone me. The phone would ring once and then silence. It would take numerous tries to connect with other guests in the hotel. Plus when you phone the hotel operator, it would sometimes ring 20 -30 times before they picked up, which to me is unacceptable. Would I stay in this hotel again? In a heartbeat.

That way, I would've booked another hotel closer to what my friends and I were looking for. We stayed from a Thursday to a Monday and had a Bahia view room. Hotel in general: Is beautiful! The hotel has a big pool with a water slide and a seperate salt water pool on the other side. Open 24hours!!! There is a pool bar which was nice, however that will come later in this review. The conceirge never picks up the phone and when I asked them about things to do they said they didn't know. The excursion are a rip off. If you want to go to the barcardi factory. Take the bus to old san juan (.75) and the ferry to the factory (1.50). The casino is nice and as long as you are playing you are offered unlimited drinks and good. We needed a cpu to check email and we were told to walk 10 minutes down ashford avenue to an internet cafe. However, when I was walking back to my room I notice a business room with computers. When I asked if I could use them, I was told of course. ($7.50 for every 15 minutes). Go figure the front desk staff would send me somewhere else!!! A great thing is that there is a STARBUCKS attached to the hotel. Try the Mayoca bread with butter!!! Rooms: The rooms were very nice however, if you get a bahia view room make sure you are not staying with 3 girls. The bathroom was super small and the toilet never flushed. We called 3 times to get the toilet fixed, it was frustrated. In the end I told the worker to just teach me how to do it and I'll fix it so I don't have to waste my time calling. The housekeeper on the other side did an awesome job. She always made sure our room was clean and smelled good. She gave us extra towels and even lined up our shoes. Staff: The front desk staff was friendly, but beware, as you will be charged a $200 incidentel fee on your credit card (which they forget to tell you when they ask you for a card). Most of the staff does not live in the area and therefore, do not know where to go to have a good time, so you have to ask random floaters you find around the hotel. The pool staff on the other hand was absolutely RUDE (two guys)! On our first night I asked what time they are open to and the response was \"until 9pm however we close when we want. You're lucky we are here now\". Not a good response because I am paying to stay here. Also, after 7pm their \"girlfriends\" would come and all they would do is talk talk talk. Good luck trying to get their attention and get a drink. Drinks are expensive too. They are in small 8oz cups and cost $10. If you are lucky you can get a buy 1 get 1 free mojito coupon for the front desk. Location: The hotel is located en El Condado. There is not much to do around there. If you walk 10 minutes down ashford avenue you can find a walgreens and lots of little shops and restaurants. DO NOT PAY FOR A CAB to get to old San juan. The C53 or B19 bus stop located right in front of the hotel will take you there for .75 cents. Buses are from 9am-9pm. Last bus pick you up at the Old San Juan bus terminal. Do not sit on the benches there are little bugs that crawl on you and bite. Nightlife: Unfortunately there is NO nightlife in the area. The hotel does have a lounge however there is never anyone there. To have a good time I recommend Brava Nightclub located in San Juan Hotel in Isla Verde, also located in Isla Verde is the Wet Club which is also very nice. Old San Juan is also a great place to party, if you catch the last bus you can be there for happy hour. The street named Forteleza is where the main bar strip is. I recommend Blend (for the music) and Tio Danny's (for the cheap drinks). Club lazer is popular in Old San Juan, however, we did not go because we heard many negative things about it. Like illegal use of substances, gang members, and such. Food: The first night we ate at the Aqua Bar in the hotel, HUGE MISTAKE! The food was not great and it was the largest tab we had the whole time we were there. If you are going to eat at the hotel, do the sushi restuarant. Good food, fast service and nice people. I also recommend El Jibarito restuarant located in Old San Juan and The restuarant where they made the 1st pina colada(can't remember the name), its expensive but if you are there a friday or saturday you can reserve a table to see a beautiful flamingo dancing show (free). We also ate in Ajillo Mojillo located 5 minutes down from Ashford avenue. The food was good but again a bit pricey. A 5 minute walk futher down and you will hit another restuarant which has GREAT FOOD and good prices. Lastly, if you are with friends and just finished partying Los Pinos is opened 24 hours. Great food and good prices! Beach: There is no huge beach at the hotel. It is a nice view with all the rocks but if you are a huge beach person I would recommend a hotel in Isle Verde. Old San Juan was beautiful! I recommend you walking into the Haiten boutiques and going to eat icecream at Ben & Jerrys. Traffic is ridiculous! So don't drive there and do not hop on the trolly cause you will NOT get anywhere. I recommend the COACH factory and Guess. Great prices on things you would never dream off in the states. Make sure to wear comfortable shoes because the streets are made of stone and rocks. In order to go to Puerto Rico you have to want to relax as the service is extremely slow and most of the businesses lack etiquette. If I were forced to go to Puerto Rico again, I would only stay at El Conrad if I were to go with family. If I were to go with friends I recommed The Sterllis casino in Isla Verde. If you want to PARTY YOUR LIFE AWAY, stay in San Juan hotel, which is for the \"young crowd\". If I were to go to Puerto Rico period, I would do a cruise with a stop at Old San Juan because that is where you get the history, art, parties, good food, etc all rolled into one.

The beach area is on the small scale but reasonable....you get more of a private beach feeling and they rent out snorkeling gear which we did on several days. The beach/lagoon area is perfect for snorkeling.... free beach towels to use, chairs, and there is a guy who frequents this beach serving fresh coconuts ..... and another person who BBQ's burgers, hotdogs, and chicken.

I searched this website reading reviews, checked out the hotel location and requested an ocean view room. The pictures are true to form. We had the \"red room\" with a wonderful balcony on the 8th floor overlooking the ocean and we were so comfortable all the way around. Check in was a breeze and when we entered our room the gracious touches included soft lighting, soothing background from the radio and a chilled bottle of champagne from the manager, Jose Padin. The bathroom was elegant and we had everything we could possibly need. We found the closets small but everything fit perfectly in drawers, etc. The bartenders were friendly in both the lobby and the swim up bar \" Hi Javie!!!\" and both pools and jacuzzi were never crowded. Very clean and friendly all the way. We frequented Starbucks most mornings but also enjoyed the inroom coffee. We walked to a few local restaurants but we also had a car and visited Old San Juan, lot's of walking on narrow sidewalks, pretty crowded when the cruise ships dock but when they clear out it's a much easier walking excursion with beautiful shops and fair prices. The Italian restaurant was wonderful and reasonably priced with a nice view. The grounds are clean and the hammocks were so relaxing. The small public beach had some great snorkling along the coral reefs and the hotel provides you with whatever you would need. If you have a balcony room, the doors do tend to close loudly and I suggest earplugs if you are bothere by noise when you sleep. The waves crashing, those little tree frogs chirping etc. can be distracting but the beds were so darned comfy who couldn't fall asleep? We visited with my husbands family as he had lived there for many years as a child and they were able to suggest some great restaurants near Isla Verde including The Ceviche House and El Rincon. Strong Peruvian influence in most restaurants and overall I never had a bad meal. The air smells like candy everywhere. Traffic and construction can be intimidating and the street signs are primarily in Spanish so it can be confusing. This was a wonderful trip for us and I would stay at this hotel again anytime. I suggest asking for an ocean view with a balcony and renting a car at the airport. Also learn some Spanish and program your GPS if you are planning to explore the island.

The pictures on the website are 100% accurate. The hotel was remodeled in a very modern, art deco look. The casino gets busy on the weekends, the lounge is fun and lively latin bands fill the sounds in the main common areas. You will definitely feel like you are in the Caribbean. The details of 2 pools, whirlpool, and very tiny beach is all true. This place is fantastic for safety, convenience, favor, and STAFF! We had a two queen bed facing the ocean in the main building, which was fantastic. Hilton beds were comfortable and offered a restful night's sleep. All was spotless. The views of sunset from our balcony was superb. The ocean waves crashing on the rocks was soothing. The bathroom was comfortable for a short stay, but with one small closet and a couple of drawers, there really is no storage for longer stays. The balcony could use a new paint job. When I was done taking my pics leaning on the balcony, my arms were full of nasty white paint chips. The chairs are rotted and not inviting at all and can definitely be trashed. The true gem to this stie is the staff. They are fabulous! Beginning with Cesar, our bellman, who greeted us when we arrived inbound and when we returned after the cruise, recognized and took time to assist us, again. The front desk staff is friendly, informative, and bilingual professionals. Truly a refreshing group. Loved them for adding the smiles, hellos, and offers to assist us. LOCATION is always important. The Condado looks like it is in the process of being rehabilitated with many hotels torn down, in construction, or out-of-business. Truly a sign of the times. Traffic is intense in all of San Juan and el Condado section is no exception. I suspect that crime is a real high concern. All the stores in the area have doorbells that have to be buzzed in to get inside. Not exactly an appealing welcome for folks to do business. There is no street parking and cars are everywhere, as are the police. Public buses are available but not frequent. Taxicabs RULE! Cab ride to pier was $19 for three of us and six bags. Drivers are friendly, bilingual and since the fares are regulated no need to worry about getting overcharged. The ride to the airport was about 10 miles, takes approximately 15 minutes, if there is no traffic and cost us $24.00 with bags. If you are going out, no luggage, we took the cab to Old San Juan, past the airport area and it only cost $12. All our traveling and cruising was still cheaper and LESS STRESSFUL then having rented a car and trying to figure out where to go, where to park which is quite an adventure, then still having to pay for parking at various parking lots all over the area plus the daily fee at the hotel to park. Another perk with the cabs, they know everything and became our personal guides, historians, and entertainers. Made some really nice new friends.

We were beyond satisfied with the experience. The hotel is located a stones throw from the more hectic and noisier part of the city. It is a short bus ride to Old San Juan and has several beautiful pools and the beach sits directly adjacent to the hotel. The rooms are nicely decorated with modern decor. The rooms are clean and housekeeping was quick and responsive. We called for more towels later one evening and no kidding they arrived nearly before we hung up the phone. We were pleasantly suprised to be upgraded to an ocean front room. The view was breathtaking. You want to experience this view from this particular hotel. The hotel is located near many good restaurants and other hotels. There is a Walgreens nearly. The hotel offers a variety of restaurants with a wide selection of food types. We ate at 2 of the restaurants. The food was good. The prices were on par with others in the area. Food is generally fairly expensive in the hotel zone. Reviewers that report food at the hotel is pricey are not sharing that food in general is expensive in the area. We had a room credit, as most guests seem to receive that offset some of the costs. This is a definite plus. Old San Juan is a 15 minute bus ride from the hotel. There is a free trolley in Old San Juan to allow you to experience the town. I highly recommend it. The concierge was very helpful giving directions to many attractions. Let me be clear about what is meant by the concierge. These are not stuffy individuals standing at podiums who appear beyond the reach of most guests. I travel often and the concierge often presents as generally unavailable to the average guests. These staff are available, friendly and very helpful to everyone. We rented a car at the airport (much more affordable than renting a car in town). We visited the rainforest and several beaches and restaurants in nearby cities. The difference in prices for food and other experiences are tremendous. I highly recommend renting a car and exploring the island. The staff was very helpful, accommodating and friendly. Check-in and out was effortless. There was always something interesting going on in the hotel. There is an evening Mojito demonstration each night and a bar. There is something for everyone. You will be pleasantly treated to the beauty and friendliness of the Caribbean when you stay at the Conrad. Some of the complaints by other reviewers appear to come from issues not related to the hotel itself. Restaurants and taxis are relatively expensive in the general area. San Juan is experiencing some development. There are new businesses going up in the area. I will definately be staying again at this location when I return to San Juan.

As other reviewers have noted, the beach is somewhat lacking, but a short walk (10 minutes or so) down Ashford Ave. will take to you an entrance to a nicer beach. Our room was fairly modest in size, but was very nice, and was very well kept. I noticed several people have made comments about insect bites. I agree with the manager's response. There is absolutely not way those bites happened from bed bugs. The place is much to clean from that. We also experienced a few (not many) insect bites during our time in San Juan, but it was a minor nuisance and no reflection on the Condado Plaza. The location of the hotel is o.k. We found that about a 5 minute walk down Ashford put us within a range of restaurants, bars, and shopping locations from fast food to local dives to very luxurious. We did this more often than we dined at the hotel. It's also about a 5-10 minute cab ride to Old San Juan. We discovered that cab rides are more expensive in San Juan than Chicago. On the other hand, parking is not included at the hotel, so the cost of a rental car adds up too.

I stayed at the Conrad Condado while in San Juan for my destination wedding. We had 10 rooms in our group and about 28 people including our 9month old son in from various cities. Check-in: Prior to our group's arrival a $700 deposit was sent in advance to the hotel's sales department. Upon check-in this deposit was not credited to our room and sadly our sales rep was \"in a meeting\" Therefore an additional $1000 PLUS hold was placed on our credit card...WITHOUT knowledge. I was told that the credit card was needed for incidentals. I did check my account soon after and about passed out upon discovery of this error. Yaritza at the front desk was very helpful getting the deposit posted to our room and contacting the bank to get the hold removed ASAP. As a bride to be, this is the LAST thing I wanted to here prior to a wedding. Rooms: The view and look of the rooms were great. However in our bathroom the water was not at all hot. I called to the front desk 3 days in a row to get assistance. The response I was given was \"let it run\" After 30 minutes, I was more than certain no hot water was coming out of the showerhead. With a 9month old this is beyond unacceptable. How do you bath a baby?? How do you give him formula when my child drinks warm formula?? I had to use another guest in our group's shower to bathe myself and my child. Housekeeping: We had a very nice housekeeper. However for whatever reason the housekeeping department did not have any washcloths. Each day, despite us having double occupancy, we got one (1) washcloth. Wow. Valet charged us for a night that we didn't even have a vehicle...that was the night of our wedding. My 86 year old grandmother was on the verge of getting kicked out of her room because the hotel was \"sold out\" and due to the errors with the deposit in the beginning the hotel erased her Saturday night stay. After speaking with a front desk clerk, her \"solution\" was \"Sorry we're sold out\" Which of course is not an adequate response AT ALL. Another manager actually helped us out and extended her stay for her original last night. The beach is not really that great, Isla Verde is a much better beach location as the area around the Conrad is very rocky. But it is very pretty. There does seem to be much entertainment as on Friday and Saturday there was a dj and it seemed to be \"active\". I am glad that I was the one to experience these issues and not our guests.

Our trip was a blast however.....we will not be staying at this hotel when we go back. #1 - The concierge was very unhelpful and like another review said the tours that the hotel sets up are far overpriced. Most tourist attractions in San Juan are very budget friendly. You'll do far better to rent a car from the Enterprise that is next door to the hotel. The people at Enterprise were actually far more helpful than the concierge with regards to restaurants, attractions & how to get around (which was fairly easy). #2 - The 2nd night/3rd day we realized that we were bitten by bed bugs or something. Luckily there is a Walgreen's down the street where we could get stuff for our bites. We changed rooms which was a little better but when we asked for some kind of help for our trouble one of the managers had a little attitude and seemed very un-surprised & unapologetic about the fact that we were bitten up. (We weren't the only guests bitten up either) #3 - There is no REAL beach attached to the hotel, you have to go up the street towards the Renaissance hotel and enter Condado Beach there.

Due to a delayed flight, my husband and I arrived to the hotel at 6:00am. The lady at the front desk was extremely nice and got us checked in right away. We had a suite, but when we arrived, it seemed smaller than I had expected. We were going to be there for 10 days and I wanted to have a little more room. I returned to the front desk to ask if there was any other room available and she switched our room right away to another wonderful suite situated on the end. It had an awesome view of both the lagoon from the living room area and the Atlantic Ocean from the balcony. The room was very spacious!! There was a sectional sofa, coffee table, large flat screen tv and work desk in the living room area. The bathroom was huge with a shower big enough for two people. The king size bed was also very comfy. The room also had a coffee maker, microwave, sink area, and plenty of drawers and closets for your clothes. The hotel itself has 5 or 6 restaurants which were excellent. Contrary to other reviews, the prices were right inline and in some cases, lower than the restaurants within walking distance to the hotel. Every restaurant offered a different fare so there was plenty to choose from. Our personal favorites were Varita's, Gusta d'Italia, and 8 Noodle Bar. Varita's is one of the newer restaurants in the hotel and offers anything from salads and sandwiches to steak. The food is excellent and the service is superb! Be sure to ask for the apple pie alamode. It was the best I have ever had! Gusta d'Italia is an Italian restaurant that is also excellent. The spaghetti and meatballs and lasagna were wonderful. The restaurant has an ocean view and service was spectacular. The restaurant also serves breakfast in the morning - it was wonderful. 8 Noodle Bar is another great choice with Chinese and Japanese cuisine. It is located across from the casino. It is open from 4:00pm to 4:00am and is a great option for late night munching. This was also a great place to eat. The portions here are huge - don't hesitate to share a meal as it is more than enough to do so! There are 3 pools at the hotel with more than enough lounge chairs and pool chairs for everyone. The ecclectic decor and bright colors of the hotel was also very nice. There wasn't alot happening at the hotel however and the bar/lounge located in the lobby appeared closed most of the time. Never fear, however, the poolside bar was lively and the drinks were marvelous - though expensive! There is plenty of hotel parking (16.00 a day), but I wouldn't bother with it. We rented a car for 2 of the 10 days we were there and really didn't need it at all. The bus stop is at the hotel. It costs 75 cents to ride. You must have exact change. The C53 bus (by the beach entry) will take you to Old San Juan. It is the last stop on the route and where everyone gets off. Once you get to Old San Juan, there is lots to see. El Morro, San Cristobal, and lots of museums to name a few. There are also lots of shops and great Puerto Rican restaurants. You must go to Raices (pronounced Ray - eee- ces) for dinner in Old San Juan. The atmosphere there and the food are something to remember. The service was awesome. Across from the Sheraton Hotel and Senor Frogs is the ferry that you can take to the Bacardi Rum Factory. It costs $1.00 per person. When you get to the other side, a $3.00 cab ride will take you right to the factory. Although you don't get to tour the actual factory anymore due to an accident that happened there several years ago, the free tour was alot of fun. We also liked the free drinks you get on the tour. PROS: Wonderful people, beautiful island, and everything within walking distance or public transportation. CONS: The beach is very small and not impressive at all. If you are coming to hang out at the beach, I don't recommend this hotel. However, if you don't mind walking a couple of blocks, Ocean Park beach is very nice. Also, you can take the bus to Isla Verde, which is still within walking distance (several blocks) which is also a wonderful beach.

Pretty, new, modern, stylish decor with a light airy tropical feel done in mostly white with aqua/green accents. Bathroom was small with only one sink and only a stall, no tub, but all new, clean white marble with nice toilettries, hair dryer, etc. that you would expect. I was initially disappointed to find my room was next to elevator, but did not experience noise from it. Only from loud talking guests in hall (not hotel's fault). LOCATION was pretty good. A number of restaurants of all price ranges nearby, a small grocery, some boutiques and car rental all within walking distance. If I were coming to San Juan for vacation, though, I would stay in Old San Juan in order to see sights and be near more restaurants. Cabs are expensive here. What I would actually do is get the heck out of SJ after a couple days and see other parts of the island via rental car. Reserve ahead, by the way. They were totally out of cars everywhere when we wanted to rent one to go to El Yunque. FOOD. Only had one meal- at hotel pool bar. It was an expensive $16 dollar chicken caesar salad, but I daresay worth it. Very large portion, homemade croutons and dressing and huge chunks of rotisserie chicken. COMMON AREAS/ LOBBY. Hotel entrance is right on street and not attractive, but once you step inside, the lobby is pretty and stylish- except casino, which is a cheesy eyesore. But the casino is off in a separate area of the hotel. Things I did not like: BEACH. Wanted to relax at beach when I first arrived. Took one look at it and went to the pool instead. It is a very small lame public beach with a busy road at one end. The view if you stand on it is mainly of other hotels, not the ocean. Very depressing since I am a beach person. Thankfully the pool area is OK. Not beautiful, but pretty nice. If you crave pretty ocean views, the hotel does have a large pretty furnished terrace at lobby level at the back that would be a nice place to have a cocktail. VIEW from my room was not attractive at all. It was of one of the hotels' structures.

There is a Starbucks next door, a Subway down the street, along with several other reasonable restaurants with great seafood. A longer walk away is a Walgreens, which takes you by Gucci, Coach, and other high-end stores.The Conrad is in an ideal location--the bus stop is outside the front of the hotel.

It was kept very clean by room service, and anything we needed from food to combs was delivered within 10 minutes of request. And now for the bad. The Hotel had a sushi bar in it, which we had to walk by to get to our room. The smell was horrible!

The side of the hotel we stayed on doubled as a banquet room(right near the pool,) and there were a lot of very nice events which took place.

This hotel is a MUST stay while visiting San Juan. The photos on this webiste and their own are spot on. We stayed for an overnight after our Princess cruise to take in San Juan and kept the theme of our trip with an Ocean view room. Talk about a room with a view...simply breathtaking! The room was extremely spacious - it was like being in a suite. The hotel is spotless, staff is extremely friendly and accomodating. We had a 5:30PM flight out the next day and we were able to extend our check-out time until 3PM and hang out by the pool for most of the day. We also got the rate with breakfast which I highly recommend if it remains available You get a coupon per person valued at $15. I ordered pancakes, got the usual 3 and only was able to eat 1 - they were HUGE so the portions are quite generous to say the least. It is an American style breakfast. Short cab ride to Old San Juan which is beautiful and offers a nice variety of shopping. You can also take the bus for 75 cents and it runs every half hour. 2 pools - one is a salt water pool and the other is fresh water with a poolside bar; very cool.

My friends and I arrived a day early into San Juan to board a cruise out of the Pan Am pier. Originally we booked the Sheraton thinking the ship was going to dock across the street, but when we found out it was docking across the water instead, we decided to find a hotel that was a little closer. With the help of this site, I checked out reviews for the SHERATON and the CONDADO PLAZA and actually found the latter to be more highly rated by travelers. So, we booked the Condado Plaza and hoped for the best. Like everyone else I wasn't overly pleased that a lean was put on my credit card or that there were all these extra charges (taxes and other fees) that were being added to the bill, but miraculously, we were able to snag an ocean view room at about the same cost as a standard room at the Sheraton. Upon arriving at the Condado we were greeted by a porter who took our luggage and then brought it up to the room, despite the fact we got a call saying that there was a mixup with which room it originally went to. That caused us to wait about 45 minutes for our luggage to arrive after check-in. Ceasar is the luggage porter and he was especially nice. The rooms itself are pretty impressive. Very modern d\u00c3\u00a9cor with one of the most imaginative bathroom layouts I have ever seen. My friends were ecstatic when they walked in the room and saw how beautiful it was. Then, they looked at the ocean view off their balcony and were convinced they were in one of the most wonderful hotels they have ever been in. After reading all the reviews I knew that this hotel was not going to be perfect. Fortunately our complaints were only minor. Firstly, after walking Old San Juan and having dinner in town, we decided to come back around 7pm to use the hot tub by the pool. We were thrilled that it was empty, but once getting into the tub we were upset to find that the water was lukewarm. Even though a sign by the tub stated the water gets no hotter than 102 degrees, we were soaking in water that was about 80 degrees. Thing is, once it gets dark, there is no hotel staff walking around the pool so there was nobody around to ask to turn the heat up. Also, there is no water pressure in the shower. You have this beautiful cubical glass shower, but once turned on, you have to deal with low water pressure. On the plus side, there was an array of lotions and body wash as well as a coffee maker (with coffee) in the room. I woke up this morning at 5am quite hungry and wanted to go to Starbucks which I heard was attached to the hotel. I was told at the front desk that Starbucks doesn't open till 7am. Meanwhile, there is NO vending machines anywhere in the hotel so I have no idea what someone would do if they needed bottled beverages or just something to snack on. The bed was extremely comfortable. With the balcony door open, I drifted off to la-la land to the sound of the crashing waves below me. It was wonderful. Just be aware that if you keep the balcony open at night the air conditioning turns off. This is to be expected. Internet WiFi was my major concern, and I am happy to report that it is working quite well in my 8th floor ocean view room. Very speedy access. Elevator, as reported, is very slow. Be prepared to wait during rush hours. Check-in was a tad slow as there seems to be an influx of people and only two clerks at the desk, but nothing to really complain about. Have not yet attempted to check out, but as reported, it doesn't seem you can do it from the room so we have given ourselves 30 minutes this morning to do it from the lobby just in case there is a line. On the plus side, this hotel is beautiful. By far, I would not hesitate to come back here next year. I just think the hotel needs to be more on top of the little things like maintaing the hot tub temperature, working on in-room checkout and perhaps providing a means for people to get snacks outside of restaurant hours.

My wife came along with me on this trip. We were deciding between the Sheraton Old San Juan, Hilton Caribe, and this hotel. We were very satisfied with our selection. The location of the hotel is ideal. You're near old San Juan (~$15 cab ride one-way), but you're not in it, so you avoid the noise, crowds, and traffic. Also, the Condado area is really nice. In the opposite directon from old San Juan, there is shopping and some pretty good restaurants. The hotel grounds are really nice. You're right on the sea. The pool is right by the beach. The beach is small, open to public, and really not worth spending time at, in my opinion. The rooms were very nice, especially the bathrooms. The one bizarre thing about the hotel was we heard the speaker (i.e. for emergency announcements) crackling during the night. The hotel sent maintenance up to fix it while we were out. When we came back, it was still making the same noises. It was loud enough and annoying enough that I had a hard time sleeping. We complained at the front desk and they moved us to an ocean view room (we had previously been in a lagoon view room). Interestingly enough, the speaker was doing the same thing in this room. It was nice to get a free upgrade, but the noise was less than ideal. That is the only negative thing I would say about the hotel. The casino is pretty small, but if you're there to gamble, it will suffice. We aren't big gamblers and having the casino there did not bother us. If you have a car, make a trip to El Yunque rain forest. We had not been to a rain forest that did not require a guide. This one does not. You're free to hike on your own and there are some breathtaking views. Luquillo beach is not far from El Yunque. The concierge suggested we go here. Pretty amazing beach. Post card worthy, I would say. Restaurants that I'd recommend: -Cafe Puerto Rico (Old San Juan) - Puerto Rican food.

Additionally, we really enjoyed the casino and ate at 2 out of the 3 restaurants at the hotel which were just fantastic as well. The service was superb and every question we had about our stay, travel advice, restaurants, Old San Juan, etc was answered in a friendly manner and with a smile. I personally think that the Conrad is a great place for families with children and everyone in between who want to relax, have a little bit of fun and enjoy some great service. If you are looking for a huge party then this is probably not your place as this hotel seemed to me to be for the more low key crowd. Overall, we thoroughly enjoyed our stay at the Conrad and definitely hope to stay there again in the future.", "Date": "April 14, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "new york", "Title": "\u201cExcellent, IF YOU ARE SMART and Know what you want\u201d", "Author": "goodwig", "ReviewID": "UR27870054", "Content": "I have been to San Juan 1/2 times and stayed at the Condado 4 times in the past 10 years (changed ovnership several times and is now a Hilton property). All the reviewers are correct . It depends on what you want and, if you are smart, you will find this hotel to be an excellent choice if you want a location that affords you the benefits of being able to walk along Ashford Avenue to other hotels, restaurants, stores, etc., along with oceanfront that has spectacular views from both your room (that is, IF you negotiate for a proper room. At night with the sliding glass door open, you can listen to the waves wash up on the shore) and the public grounds. In fact, it fronts the ocean and also faces the lagoon to the south, which gives you access to a nice public beach which is adjacent to the hotel property. I am a very fussy (and frequent) traveler, and money is no factor, so I choose the Condada over all other hotels in San Juan because it has the best combination of amenities that I want while on vacation. By the way, the Caribe Hilton is directly across the lagoon from the Condado (and a l0 minute walk across the beach). It, too, is very nice, but like all hotels, if you don't express your strong preference for a good room, you will end up facing a parking lot or a construction site !", "Date": "April 12, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Las Vegas, Nevada", "Title": "\u201cI would definately go back to this hotel\u201d", "Author": "terrigirl", "ReviewID": "UR27609032", "Content": "I stayed here for 6 days, 3 for business and 3 for pleasure, I had a great ocean view room on the 10th floor.

The town closes early. If you get down there go eat at Reises, the food is pure Puerto Rican and superb. If you want to go to the Bacardi Rum Factory take the bus and walk to the Ferry, it cost $.50 to take the Ferry one way. When you get off you have to take a cab over and back to the Ferry.

After reading TripAdvisor reviews, I was nervous about what we would encounter, but the hotel was great. The location and amenities were wonderful, and we did not face erroneous charges (although we knew going in that most resorts charge \"resort fees\"). Highlights 1. Rooms: The rooms are beautiful and very clean. We got upgraded from a \"bahia vista\" room to an ocean view room on the 10th floor. The Condado Plaza's location is exquisitely beautiful. We brought lunch to our balcony several times so we could watch the waves break below us. 2. Location: Condado proved to be a good base for exploring Puerto Rico. There are tons of restaurants and shops just down Ave Ashford, and Old San Juan is just a short bus ride away. 3. Amenities: The pools are not heated, but there are 3 of them, and there are 2 wonderful hot tubs. We spent a lot of time relaxing at the resort, lounging on the chairs and reading. The fitness center is also great. We also enjoyed lots of towels from the towel hut. 4. Reliable wi-fi is included for free in the resort fee. Lowlights: 1. The beach chairs are free, but umbrellas are $11. We didn't opt for the umbrella since we didn't plan to stay at the beach all day. 2. We didn't bring our tennis racquets because the hotel offered some, but we didn't know the rental fee was $15/pop. 3. Front desk check-in staff: The woman who checked us in seemed overly distracted by the busy Saturday crowd and wasn't very helpful. She didn't give us a map of the property or the weekly activities' guide. 4. The pools can be chilly. Other tips: 1. Take the bus: We're from Washington, DC, and we dislike bus riding in general, but several of the Condado Plaza staff encouraged us to take the bus (21 or 53) to Old San Juan. We are so glad we did. The bus is clean, full of tourists, and only $.75 per trip. We saved nearly $50 in cab fare! 2. Restaurants nearby that we liked: Mike and Charley's Pizza (good for lunch); Cielito Lindo (Mexican food on Magdalena); Chili's (for some American comfort food) 3. Walgreens is down the street. We bought soda and snacks and put them in our room fridge. 4. If you want to visit El Yunque, you can rent a car from the rental shop in the hotel.

For example, this is a beach resort. One might think they could spend all their time on the beach. We went on to the beach around 4PM on Saturday, and were told that we couldn't have a lounge chair because \"the beach is closed\". We could stay on the beach, but what's the point? It's a 100-foot wide artificial beach on a lagoon, overlooking a construction-bound causeway. Forget about catching any waves. And if you happen to hit the beach before closing time, expect to pay $11 if you want to rent an umbrella for the day. And the service was terrible and overpriced. We understand from our travels that in most places the waitstaff take a long time, but we were consistently left waiting 20-30 minutes at a time for drinks. It's difficult to maintain a decent buzz when you keep sobering up between drinks. One also begins to resent paying $9 for a rum and coke when it comes in a dixie cup. Apparently they couldn't spring for glass. The rent-a-cop down by the pool doesn't appreciate you bringing your own bathroom glasses down with you either. I wonder if he's trained in CPR, because I saw no lifeguards. Speaking of which, the bar closes at 9. What kind of bar closes at 9? We go hiking in the rain forest and trekking about town and all we want is some greasy chicken wings, or a quesadilla, or mozzarella sticks (you know, gourmet food with the price to match), and the bar is closed right about the time it should be opening. If I could have reached behind the bar and poured myself rum and coke all night, I still would have felt ripped off. The rooms were beautiful, and we had a fantastic view. However, the floors are covered in slick white tile. Several times this past weekend I slipped, and were it not for my cat-like instincts, I would have cracked my head.

If you expect any kind of humidity or moistness during your trip to San Juan, bring some gorilla snot for your feet.

Perhaps I got spoiled by the Caribe Hilton across the way which has beautiful pools overlooking the ocean. The Condado Plaza does have a water slide and swim up bar. - Beach is public, which does allow the potential for experiencing a bit of local flavor, but is directly under/next to the bridge.

This was advised in the confirmation in very small writing at the bottom of our email confirmation and the total price on the confirmation email didn't show the additional fees. The additional fees included resort tax (approx. $60 per day) of which the Condado Plaza advised that this was to pay for the casino being open 24 hours a day and the unmanned gym being open 24 hours per day????

Bottom line - you're gonna get what you pay for - if you're miserale in your hometown with a lousy marriage, Puerto Rico aint gonna change it.

Bathroom in the ocean view rooms are appropriate sized as was the rest of the hotel room. The entire ocean side wall was glass and balcony; very nice. The room was contemporary which is not my taste but great fun for a vacation stay. The view from the balcony (9th floor) was fantastic. The Lobby and Casino: A+. Clean, fun and no smoking allowed. Won $150 bucks! The first time ever I've won! The Restaurants: C+. I wasn't excited with the selection. The Italian restaurant seemed the best choice but the marinara sauce was weak. I looked for a room service menu but not kept in room and couldn't access menu on hotel tv. It seemed too difficult to bother with. Best bet: walk down Ashford St 100 feet to the Mexican Hacienda. The food was fantastic and awesome view. The Beach and Pools: B+. Shared beach with public and really enjoyed it. It seemed great to share the space and interact with locals. Beach is large enough for need and several other public beaches are within very easy walk down Ashford St. All beaches are mostly sand. Pools are private and very well maintained. The Sites: DON'T TAKE A CAB. Outside hotel is Bus Stop (PARADA) and take B21 bus into Old San Juan. cost is 75 cents and very safe. See El Yunque Rainforest, All of Old San Juan, local beaches The Housekeeping Cleaners: A+ Enough said, be sure to tip. The Housekeeping managers: C-. I called 3x for a light bulb replacement in the bathroom and to get a lighting panel fixed on light fixed on side of bed. Next day a mismatched light bulb showed up when i asked house cleaner directly and no one ever came by to fix light panel. Is this a big deal? No, but its not the problems, its the response to the problem that people remember. I prepare to leave feeling that although the Condado Hotel and Casino has what it takes to be 4-5 stars I wonder if they are committed to providing that level of service. The Bars: B-. Friendly staff but as long as bar drinks are $9 for a simple vodka tonic, people should buy liquor and mixers at the nearby corner store and save possibly a couple hundred dollars. Seriously, it's worth doing. The Bill: B+. Check your bill as I had extra fees to remove regarding valet parking when no one visited and I didn't have a car. Overall cost was ok as I travel alot and adjusted quickly.

Casino was cheap to gamble.. 5 dollar mins for blackjack and other table games.. and Roulette only 2 dollar.. even for outside bets.. Hotel room was big, nice balcony with very nice city view.. 9th floor..#907 no need for the ocean view rooms as this room overlooked downtown San Juan and the small bay.. bathroom was very large, nice shower in the middle, plenty of space for all our clothes and everything else.. coffee maker, fridge, safe.. ice machine just outside our room.. I really have no complaints at all besides the costs.. inroom movies were a bit pricey at 15 dollars a piece.. we ate at the hotel a couple of times.. the Italian restaurant was not bad and the steak house was excellent.. but a bit pricey.. parking for overnight at the hotel was 15 a day so not bad.. hotel has small beach which is not to bad.. went to several beaches outside San Juan and they werent any better than the small private beach at the hotel... Hotel is non smoking property so if you smoke you have to leave and go outside or smoke from your balcony.. no smoking in the Casino.. no complaints with this and I am a smoker.. Anyway hotel is very modern.. very close to south beach type hotel.. there is a deserted building next door to the hotel.. not sure why.. but didnt distract from the area.. hotel is on the rich area on a strip with pricey shops and overpriced restuarants.. Old San Juan is about a 10 minute drive across the bay.. so hotel is in a pretty good location.. a bit tricky to get there from the airport as our directions were terrible but after a day of driving around we figured out all the streets, its real helpful if you know spanish.. all street signs are in spanish and most people speak spanish, unless you are in the resort or tourist areas.. where most also speak english, not a problem for us as I speak spanish but if you dont.. you might want to study a bit before your trip to PR.. one thing I underestimated about PR is the size of the island.. its huge.. so plan your day trips wisely as it can take hours of driving to get places.. its at least an hours drive to the ferry station for the other islands.. all in all I would stay in this hotel again.. the pics of their web site are pretty accurate of the rooms and amenties.. We only visited the east part of the island and Vieques island for one day so looking forward to another trip there and seeing the west and south side and Culebra.. plan for a night or two if you want to go to the other islands.. a quick day trip that we did was not worth it.. you need more time than a day trip.. also no motorcycle rentals on Vieques as for some reason its not available anymore.. I think something about insurance or some accident there so it was discountinued when we were there.. the taxis at the ferry station arent really good as they really only want to take you to one close beach.. so staying a night or two there is better so you can go to better beaches.. Esperanza beach is not that great which is where the taxis want to take you... Other than that.. I recommend this hotel.. nice comfy beds.. free internet.. hope this helps if your thinking of staying here..", "Date": "December 29, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "2", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Pittsburgh", "Title": "\u201cNot a good experience overall\u201d", "Author": "tp77", "ReviewID": "UR22999417", "Content": "We stayed in this hotel in December 2008 for one night.

Ridiculous. - There was a private party right under our windows. When we checked in we were assured that the party won't last all night. They meant it, it only lasted until 2 AM. We traveled with an infant, so loud music until 2 AM was NO fun for us. The only thing that the hotel manager did for us is he asked the musicians to tone it down, which did not help much. - Internet (included in the \"resort fee\") did not work in our room or in the room of my parents. We were given keys to two other empty rooms on our floor, but it didn't work there either. Using internet in the business center came at an extra cost and it took a long time to find an employee who could help us at the business center.

House-keeping was good - although a maid entered my room while I was sleeping at just after 7.00am...and didn't apologize. Rooms were very nice. Internet connection was frustrating and inconsistent. In fact, everything was pretty good...only one serious concern. BEWARE the hidden charges!!! The housekeeping, taxes, gratuity, etc are all stated before I arrived, so I knew I was in for that. The charge that took me by surprise was...from check in, they held an ADDITIONAL US$100 per day (!!!!) in case of goodness knows what! This was not mentioned, or explained at any point during my stay. I stayed for over a week, just after the Global Financial Crisis hit - so my domestic currency (I'm not from the US) was taking a battering. As such, this additional charge amounted to almost $1,500.00 (in my local currency). They put a hold on this amount, which maxed out my credit card - because they also had a hold on my regular room costs. So, while I thought I had plenty of credit available, all of a sudden I didn't. This also happened to a colleague who was also attending the conference and staying in another room. In fact, if she hadn't enquired about this, then neither of us would've known about this use of our money. I travel quite extensively and have NEVER had this kind of charge added to a room EVER!

Did not eat at any of the hotel's restaurants, but there are many. Pools are nice, but the beach area is small and, upon entering the water, rather rocky. The water is calm though since you are more in a lagoon rather than the Atlantic. There are also some bridge repairs taking place adjacent to the beach and if they are driving piles for the bridge's foundation, then it can be noisy. Close to Old San Juan and other hotels/boutiques (Cartier, Gucci) on the Condado strip. Housekeeping was efficient, but not necessarily all encompasing. Bellman service was also polite and quick, but missed little things (i.e. placing luggage on luggage stand).

Wish they would just provide you with a special ticket that allows you to come and go as you please without having to waste time validating a ticket.

I just want to let everyone know that this hotel is the best hotel I have ever stayed at. The rooms are exceptionally clean and decorated with a beautiful modern decor. The bathroom has to be one of the nicest bathrooms I have ever seen anywhere, let alone a hotel room. There is a shower right in the middle of the bathroom that is all encased in a glass enclosure which is a set up I will be copying in my own master bathroom. Even the toiletries that are provided are of top notch quality and comparable to any expensive brand name. And to boot, the cleaning service takes the time to clean your room thoroughly and carefully place items that are out of place back to where they should be. Simply put, you must see the room for yourself to really get an appreciation of the focus on detail that was put into the decoration and set up of the entire room. As for the rest hotel, it just keeps getting better. In the lobby level there is a bar that just isn't a simple old bar. It's comparable to some of the nicest bars/clubs that I've seen over in South Beach. The bartender that was on duty that night (monday) was a guy named Lance who was everything you would like to see in a resort bartender; funny, knowledgeable of the area and other vacation spots in the world, and his personality simply just made our night. I believe he said he was just getting back in to bar tending and working just one night that week. If I were the manager of that bar, I would hire him on a permanent basis in a heartbeat. And if you don't want to be inside and listen to the music that is playing, there is an expansive covered porch area facing the ocean where you have the freedom to walk around and sit wherever you please. Now for the pool area...There are 2 different pools. One huge 3 foot deep pool that wraps around the building with lights that change colors during the evening, and full bar that serves the pool with wait staff that will bring you your drink or food right to you with the nicest similes and personality in the world, and to boot has a volleyball net and a very slick water slide that my wife seemed to taken a loving too. The food is very reasonably priced and very good. Then there is a 6 foot deep salt water pool !!! As for the beach, it is somewhat of a lagoon set up that is protected by large rocks roughly 400 feet away from the beach so that the waves aren't too hard to handle and anyone (including my wife who can't swim) can enjoy the ocean water safely. Going back to the wait staff, we ordered food by the pool and asked them if it would be ok to eat the food by our chairs on the beach. They smiled and said not only can you eat there we will bring the food out to you. I was floored. And again, it gets better. We looked over to a gazebo by the right side of the beach and saw a guy standing there with what looked like a massage station. My wife and I walked over and asked the gentleman what we did, and he said he was a massage therapist. Well when we heard that, we absolutely had to take advantage of that. My wife went first and then me 2nd. Just think to yourself... You're getting a massage from a professional, under a gazebo over looking the ocean, with the sounds of the Caribbean all around you. It just doesn't get any better than that. Once we went back into the ocean we ran into a few other people who were also from NJ. Everyone one of them were also impressed with the place and had perma smiles on their faces. The experience just keeps getting better and better. I can't comment on the Casino because I don't gamble, but if the casino is anything like the rest of the hotel it just has to be another enjoyable part of the place. All in all I have to say that if you're looking forward to booking a trip to Puerto Rico, you must stay at the Condado. The Ritz, La Concha and Condado Plaza are the 3 gems of San Juan. The people who left negative reviews about this place have to be the types of people who complain no matter where they go even if they stay at the Waldorf in NYC because there is no way a hotel can do any better that what Condado has done for my wife, me and my friends this past week. The Condado and it's staff have given us memories that will certainly last us a lifetime.

I should say that we are local professionals who usually use certain hotels in Puerto Rico for business partners who comes from the states. We have noted that when it comes to service to local tourists, the Condado Plaza has another rule for treating us. It is a kind of a \"gentle-cynical-roughness\" that from our perception does not contribute to a pleasant stay. Condado Plaza should improve the lack of proactiveness from the front desk personnel because it was and it will be the cause for incidents like ours. None of the front desk persons said anything about not having the room ready nor they provided any alternatives. They were just there like two inactive bodies occupying a tridimensional space. We would also like to recommend Condado Plaza to radically change their anti-local tourism policy. This is not good during these recession days. The hotel has been beatifully renewed. However, all that beauty was not enough to change the way we felt after the incident. From our side we will not recommend this hotel to our business partners.

The hotel itself is nice, clean, and stylish. I'll start with the overall Positives, and then I will give you the Negatives... Positives: - the room itself was very nice and large. The ocean view has a GREAT view... you wake up in your bed and you are looking right out onto the water. The room was stylish and had a unique look to it. The color scheme, the shower, etc.... all very unique. - The room was cleaned in a timely fashion. - Room service was solid. The breakfast was good, came on time, and was not too expensive. - The balcony in the room looking over the water was great. - The pool / hot tub area is beautiful, and fairly large. I never felt like I was struggling to get a lounge chair. The hammocks are a nice touch. - The outdoor restaurant was pretty good. Nice location, good food. - The restaurants in the hotel are very good, especially the Strip House Steakhouse. It is very pricey (similar to New York City prices) but it is worth it. The food is excellent, the service is superb, and the overall atmosphere is great. We had a table overlooking the ocean which was a nice touch. If you want to spend $200 on a romantic dinner for two, I'd recommend the Strip House. The Italian restaurant on the mezzanine level is good too. We had breakfast and lunch there and the food is very good and reasonably priced. - The casino had $2 minimums for roulette... always a good thing. - The bar/lounge areas are lively, energetic, and fun. Negatives: - There are literally like 3 elevators in the entire hotel. We found ourselves waiting 5-10 minutes for a hotel at times. Not fun, especially being an impatient New Yorker. - There is minimal service at the Front Desk, which makes for long lines and more impatience on my part - Service overall was rude. The bellhop that greeted us and took our luggage to our room was very nice and very friendly. However, the employees working the front desk, casino and pool area are very rude. - Communication between the hotel and guests stinks... for example, we were looking for the Tony Roma restaurant in the hotel for about 15 minutes until we asked an employee and realized that it no longer existed. The same thing happened when we were looking to buy gelato. They have a big sign out near the pool area that says \"Gelato\". When we went over to buy some, we could not find it. It was not until we asked an employee that we were told there was no gelato. Just overall disappointing... - The biggest disappointment of all was the \"beach\" area. I have been to some beautiful beaches in Puerto Rico, but this is not one of them. The beach is small, dirty, and the view is one that looks onto the nearby highway and construction sites. Not very relaxing at all, and VERY disappointing. I don't want to be sitting on a beach with a Corona and looking out onto a busy highway and construction site. Condado needs to do something to change the atmosphere there or just eliminate the beach all together. It was just plain ugly. - The casino was disappointing. Despite the low table minimums, the dealers were rude, and the games were questionable. While playing roulette, there were roughly TEN instances where the ball left the roulette wheel completely... and another 4 or 5 instances where the ball rolled along the edge of the numbers for 45 - 60 seconds before finally falling into a number. I've played roulette in many casinos and I've never seen the equipment THAT disfunctional or suspicious. The dealers didn't act like this was anything out of the ordinary. Either get some new equipment or get your staff to be a little more customer service oriented. Who wants to gamble when it seems like you're possibly being cheated out of a fair chance to win????? Not to suggest that the casino was rigging the games, because I am sure they were not... but when I left the casino after two hours I just had a bad taste in my mouth. Overall the Condado was a nice hotel with some good and some bad.

However, from the time I walked in, I missed the classic look it used to have before the so called remodeling. I agree a 100% with the person who spoke about \"the locals\" at the Casino. It used to be a very formal and elegant place. Now it is a hang out for the elderly and the lonely. I totally dislike the informal atmosphere and found it amazing that in today's economy, the majority of the people playing were women and elderly. It depressed me to walk through it. The \"remodeling\" has given the hotel a cheap look. The rooms are large and nice, but they need maintenance badly. Doors to the balcony do not lock or open easily; there is no electricity in some outlets, the phones do not work and by the way we also delt with the elevator problem-the back elevator was out of service twice for the 5 days and 4 nights we were there. The concierge desk is the biggest joke of the whole place. The guys who open the door for guest hide behind it pretending to be polishing luggage cars, while the ladies chat on the phone. We approached it several times and none stop talking or hang up to help us, one even threw her cell phone under the table! I also agree that the information and knowledge changed depending on who was there. Transportation is a pain, hard to get, expensive for a short distance to Old San Juan and I believe it should be a service to the guest. The italian restaurant indeed had great food and good portions, lousy service. The guys all looked tired or mad to be there?!?! Only Mr. Neumann, Jesus in security and Iris at the gift shop made me/us feel welcome and provided us with great-outstanding customer service. Again, I agree with what I read, if you only want a great bed to rest and the ocean and pools to enjoy the sun and sound of the waves daily-then this is it; but if you appreciate service and a desire to help the tourist so you go back, forget it! No perks, no coupons, no hotel transportation to and from airport and no transportation to Old San Juan at all-ridiculous and poor PR for the hotel.

We really enjoyed our stay. We had a mini-suite on the lagoon side with a partial ocean view across the street. The room was clean and had everything you could ask for. We appreciated the big refrigerator. The fitness center is very nice and we made good use of it. The pool on the lagoon side was closed during our stay. They were filming a George Clooney movie. Others saw him but we did not. Rats! We usually sat by the big pool with the slide and spent time on the beach. The beach isn't very big but it is nice and the water is calm due to big rocks which were put there to break the big waves. There are many restaurants within walking distance on Ashford Ave. If you're out and about after dark watch your step! There are many \"holes\" and curbs that are easy to trip over. I rolled my ankle on a small curb and fell. Now I have a large abraision on my leg as a souvenier. We rented a car from Dollar. I was excited that I found a good deal and apparently so did many other people. The agency is off the airport property so we took a shuttle and then there was a long line to get the car. It took us over an hour to pick up the car. In hindsight we would not rent a car again unless we plan to spend the majority of the trip outside of San Juan. Driving is a challenge in San Juan since the roads/highways are not clearly marked. We saw a lot more of the city than we planned to. We drove to El Yungue and enjoyed hiking some of the trails. We did get lost on the way but eventually found it. The weather was perfect and the people were very friendly.

The hotel has completed the renovations that I encountered during my first stay. I had no problem checking in since it was close to the 4pm check in time. My room overlooked the bay which was nice since I did not have to look at the traffic down below. The hotel staff was attentive to my needs and requests. Upon checking in, I noted that 2 light bulbs were missing. They sent someone up within 10 minutes after reporting it to the front desk. However, the iron was missing and after waiting 30 minutes for an iron to come up, I had to leave without pressing my shirt. While I was out, they did leave an iron for me. I was on government business so I was able to get a government rate. If you are traveling on official government business, I would recommend contacting the Puerto Rican Tourism Board to obtain authorization for the tax exemption. The hotel provided me the contact information so be sure to ask them. They included a food voucher equal to $7.00 which could be used in any of the hotel restaurants. I recommend having the breakfast in the Gusto Di Italia at least once. The portions are huge and filling. After the first day, I decided to eat a lighter breakfast during my stay. To work off the calories from the big meal, I hit the gym. While many hotels say they have a \"fitness center\" which could be an old treadmill and stationary bike, the Condado is one of the best I've seen at a hotel. The equipment includes about 5 treadmills (LifeFitness) that includes an individual TV on each treadmill, a couple of bikes and some weights. There are also 2 sauna rooms and plenty of towels. There is a pool on both sides of the hotel. The only drawbacks that I found so far would be the noise. I stayed on the 5th floor and could hear music up until 10-11 pm. I could also hear my next door neighbors several times. It wasn't annoying, but it shows that the walls are thin. The bathroom was nice, but kind of cramped when getting in and out of the shower. The main issue that I had and which I read many negative comments on would be the elevators. More often than not there was only one elevator working. My concern would be if there was a fire and the guests would have to evacuate. One of the exits only goes down to the 3rd floor which you would have to exit and go to the other end of the corridor to get to the Mezzanine or Lobby floor.

We stayed at the hotel prior to our cruise. I have been going to Puerto Rico all of my life (37 years) and it is my favorite place in the world. We had visited San Juan last year and stayed at the Caribe Hilton. When we were visiting last year we went by the Condado Plaza Hotel and Casino and had seen all of the renovations. We knew we were going to come back in 2008 and noted it as a place to stay. Upon our arrival we were met with a very long line for check in. There was actually only 1 person at the check in desk upon our arrival but slowly more people started to help out. We waited about 20 minutes and then we were assisted. We were told that the only ocean view rooms that were available had 2 Queen beds as opposed to the 1 King bed we had requested. We said it was o.k. and were given our key to room #842. The room was perfect. The renovations of both the lobby and the rooms are great. We had a great balcony with a perfect view of the ocean. The bathroom was really nice and everything was very clean. The beds were also very comfortable and after our first night we both noted what a great, restful sleep we had. We visited the casino and had a good time. Ate breakfast both mornings at the Gusto D'Italia Restaurant. The food was very good and plentiful, the service not so great. The waiter was not overly friendly and we had to ask for things more than once. We had ice cream in the Gusto D'Italia one night and the ice cream attendant was very nice. The bar was also very nice and they make a great Pina Colada. The beach area is very small and was quite shaded so we opted to sit by the rock wall on the side of the hotel. It was extremely peaceful and the sound of the waves was wonderful. The elevators, I have to say, were very quick. I had read on several reviews about how slow they were but we did not find this to be a problem. Our biggest complaint was when we called down to the desk and asked for 2 more towels and 2 wash cloths as they had not been replenished by the room attendant the day before. What they brought us was 1 towel and when my husband explained that we needed 1 more towel and 2 wash cloths was told they would be coming right away. After an hour had passed, and they still had not arrived, my husband called the front desk and was told that they are very busy and were not sure when they could get them to us. This for us was a big turn off as a hotel of this caliber should have stocked the towels in the room to begin with and then they should have definitely brought us what we requested but then to be told they are too busy, that was not right. Fortunately this was our only complaint and hope to visit the Condado Plaza Hotel and Casino again in the very near future.

The lobby, room (city view), pool area and even casino are all a joy. The cubicle shower is a curious (i.e., fun) experience (door leaks a bit though). Balconies are always nice. The three pools (fresh water, salt water, hot tub) are all in great shape, and who isn't tempted by the swim-up bar? No-password wi-fi not only in the rooms but throughout the property. Unfortunately, the act of actually staying at the resort becomes a task rather than an experience. Here's the rundown: --For most of my stay only one of the three elevators was operating (this is the second hotel in a row where I've seen this -- trying to cut electricity costs?). A ten-story property cannot have only one working elevator; it's simply not an option. --The tour desk is an absolute disaster. They only book their own tours (the Condado is part of a local chain). My tour for the first day was rained out, and the lady who tried to reschedule couldn't confirm what was being offered when and assured me that someone would get back to me by 9PM (for a tour at 8AM the next morning). Sure enough, the next morning nobody knew anything about anything. Bottom line: In three full days they couldn't schedule a single tour for me. If you can make alternative arrangements (Gray Line, etc.) do so. --My last full day I returned to my room about 1PM after swimming. There was only one housekeeper on the entire floor, and she was sitting in a room watching television! I came back at 4:40PM and my room STILL wasn't made. I had stuff to do and told them not to bother. --Ordered a Heineken at the pool, and then watched for ten minutes while the waitress chit-chatted with the bartender. Got up and left. --Had a casino dealer more interested in the baseball game on the screen rather than actually dealing. Very annoying. (On a side note, a lot of local trash gamble in the Condado's casino. Don't expect a \"Vegas business convention\" atmosphere.) My guess is that the bigger chains skim off the best staff and the Condado has to settle for second-tier employees. Bottom Line: If you're a low-maintenance, laid-back sort of traveler (and this is a beach resort, after all), then the Condado will probably do you just fine. But if good service is an important part of your vacation experience, then be sure to explore other options.

First let me just say that originally I had booked a reservation to stay at this hotel for 9 days instead of the two days that I lasted with my family at this hotel.The original comfirmed reservation was to have taken place from Friday August 15 to Sunday August 24,2008 Back in May this year I was considering going back to Puerto Rico for a longer stay than the 6 days I stood at the San Juan Marriott Resort and Stellaris Casino in the Condado area last year in October. We had such a great time specially at the Marriott that I wrote a beautiful review about the Hotel here on Tripadvisor and in the review I had stated that if we will ever go back to Puerto Rico this will be the hotel that we will go back to. I made a decision back in May this year to at least try another hotel just to see how good other hotels may fair against the Marriott. That is why after reading so many reviews about the Condado Plaza Hotel and Casino(some good ones and some bad ones) I felt that the good ones were more than enough to make me want to stay at this Hotel. !HUGE MISTAKE! When I made the reservation through the hotel's website and obtaining my confirmation #, right away I placed a call to the Hotel directly from NY just to make sure that everything was as schedule specially confirming my request of an Ocean Vista Room, High Floor and most of all a room with \"TWO BEDS\" since I was traveling with my lovely girlfriend and my adorable 12 year old daughter. After talking to an agent from the hotel she assured me that everything will be as scheduled. She told me that upon my arrival to the Hotel there will be an Ocean Vista Room High Floor with TWO Beds waiting for us. Not only did I called on the day of the reservation but I also called on June and this time I spoke to Gabriel who assured me that everything was fine with the reservation an that I will be getting a room just as I have requested with two beds,high floor and facing the ocean. I placed another called the first week of August to make sure once again that all was as schedule with my reservation and thn again I spoke to another agent from the hotel who again told me that everything is ready and that my room \"exactly as I have requested it\" will be waiting for me upon my arrival. Upon our arrival at the Hotel on Friday August 15 with my rented car from Hertz I was just about to get into the Hotel entrance when we realized that it was been blocked by a barrier with a police officer standing in front of it. The police officer came to the car an told me that I could not get it but I explained to her that I was a guest at the hotel and that I had just arrived from NY and I was going to check in into the hotel. She told me to wait a second and she went to talk to another officer where at one point they started some sort of an argument because they wanted to decide who was going to move the barrier so I can get into the hotel. After letting my drive into the hotel I came to the Valet Parking area where I had to wait for at least 20 minutes before anyone can come to help us with the luggage or even take the car. Finally a guy from the valet parking came in and asked me if I was checking in and I told him yes and also mentioned to him that I will need a bellman to bring our luggage to the room to which he replied that he did not know where the bellman was. At this point I just said to him just park the car for me and we will carry our on luggage into the hotel. When the doors from the hotel opened we could not believe what we were seeing. There was so many people in the lobby drinking an partying and the music was so loud that we were trying to get thru the people and at some point we had to yelled \"EXCUSE ME\" so they could move so we can make it to the front desk to check in. We finally made it to the front desk and were greeted by Fernando to whom I had to speak out loud so he can hear me because of the loud music being played in the lobby. I gave him my name and told him that I had a reservation for a High Floor, Ocean Vista Room with two double beds. I could tell right away that something was wrong immediately because of the expression on his face. He said to me that I did have an Ocean Vista Room on the 9th floor but only 1 bed. With everything that has been going on so far since we arrived at the hotel I started to get a little upset but chose to be a little diplomatic about it and told Fernando that I have been calling the hotel every month since I made the reservation to make sure everything was as schedule an that the most important thing was having two beds and that everytime I called I was assured that I will get a room with two beds. He said that they only had a room with only one bed. I asked him why a hotel with over 500 rooms and with a comfirmed reservation that was made almost three months ago can provide me me with what I asked for to which he replied that \"all the hotel does guarantee is an Ocean Vista room but not the specific amount of beds\" I said to him how do you expect the three of us to sleep on the same bed when I am almost 6'2. He said that he could send me an \"air mattress\" to our room at least for the night and that I can speak to the manager in the morning so he can change out room to one with two beds. At his point was almost 9pm and we were so tired and hungry that I agreed to take the room with the air mattress and wait until the next day to be transfer to another room with two beds. I asked him why the hotel so so crowded and he told me that the Hotel had booked a Local Political Convention and that is why the hotel was so packed. He said to leave the luggage by the front desk and that he will have a bellman take them upstairs. I took my room keys and asked him to tell me where the elevators where so I can go up to my room and when he pointed the elevators to me I could not believe what I saw. There was a line so long to take the elevators that I knew it was going to take us a while just to get in them. After waiting for about 15 minutes waiting for an elevator since everytime they came to the lobby they were full to capacity from people going up an down I asked him if there was another way to get to the room he told me that there was another elevator in the back towards the pool that not too many people know about. When we got to this elevator there was also a lot of people but not as much as the main/front elevators so this time we only waited for around 5 minutes to get in. We arrived to room # 912 and found the room to be clean with one bed and an \"L shaped \"sofa in front of the TV. The bellman showed up around 20 minutes later with our luggage an I asked him if he knew where was our \"air mattress. He said not to worry about it because it will be brought up to our room and we did not need to be there since houskeeping has the key to the room. We decided to go out the hotel to get something to eat and we felt that by the time we came back the \"air mattress\" will be in the room. This time on the way down we had to take th stairs because when we wen to the elevator area in our floor there was a lot of people waiting for the elevators. We came back to the room around almost 11:00pm and when we got ot the room there was no air mattress to be found, I called the front desk for at least 5 minutes before anyone came to answer the phone. This is not an exaggeration. This is a fact. Finally when I got someone to anwer they promise that they will send and air mattress right away. This was at 11:10PM and we all went to sleep around 1 am and still no air mattress. In had to sleep in the L shaped sofa that was in the room so my Daughter and girlfriend can sleep in th bed. This was very uncomfortable because I am almost 6'2 and I wanted my daughter an girlfriend to get a good night sleep since we have been up since 5am that day because our 9AM flight was canceled by JetBlue and we had to booked another flight thru American Airlines just to make it to Puerto Rico. While sleeping we kept waking up because our room was right across the ice making machine which at that time it became a \"hang out place\" for the drinking guests of the Political Convention that was taken place at the hotel and these people were talking so loud and and laughing right the front of our room to early hours in the morning. All I remember was that the last time I heard people talking was around 3:00am but I was so tired that I kept sleeping. The following day Saturday August 16th I was downstairs at 8 am so I can speak to the front desk manager Mr. Jean Pierre Aponte.I explained to him my situation to which he was really very apologetic and he told me that he will do whatever he could to get me a room with two beds. I gave him my cell phone number to call me because we had plans to go to the Old San Juan during the day. Mr. Aponte called me aroun 2pm but did not have good news for me. He could not find a room with two beds and most of all he did not even have an \"air mattress\" to offer me. He told me that he will take $25 off my bill for every day that I did not have an air mattress. I told Mr. Aponte that this is not what I wanted but I will have to think what I was going to do. We came back to the hotel around 5pm to find out the same old story . Over packed lobby with people holding drinks,extremely loud live music and a line of people waiting for elevators. We went to the back of the lobby to use elevator near the pool which it was not as busy as the main ones an to our surprise the elevator was out of service. We decided to go up the stairs because it was going to take a while if we were going to wait for the elevators. It took us a little longer because my daughter as a problem with one of her knees and it takes her a while to go up stairs. We made it to our room and decided to just change an relax at the pool. \"HUGE MISTAKE\" When we arrived at the pool , the pool was so packed with the guest and friends of the Political Convention that there was no chairs available at all. We decided to go to the beach instead and when we went to get the chairs by the beach they were all tied up with ropes. We asked why? and they told us that the beach chairs can only be used until 6pm. Guess what? I looked at the time and it was 6:10pm! Our luck\" Well we had no choice but to sit on the sand and do the best we could. While seating on the beach I looked at my daughters face and I saw how sad she was. She was also in pain because her knee started to hurt because of the climbing thru the stairs to our room. It was at this point that I decided that I had enough of the Condado Plaza Hotel. I told my girlfriend, packed the suitcases because we are checking out of this lousy hotel and we are going to the Marriott. I walked to the San Juan Marriott Hotel and right away they found me a room with 2 beds. It was costing me over $500 more that the Condado Plaza Hotel but guess what? It was worth it. I returned to the Condado an had to carried part of our luggage downstairs because we waited for 25 minutes in the room and when I called the front desk (which I had to call 3 times before anyone answer the phone) I was told that it was taking longer than expected because they only had 1 bellman working that night. Can you believe that a Hotel such as big as this one had 1 Bellman working on a Saturday night. When I got to the lobby I happen to find Fernando the same guy that checked us in and I told him that we were checking out. I explained to him why and he understood. He was also really apologetic and he said to wait a minute that he was going to talk to management to make sure I will not get charge for the night because check out time was 1pm and it was almost 8 pm when I was checking out. He came back and told us that I will not be charge for the night. They also took of $25 dollars for the two days I did not have the so call an hard to find \"air mattress\". I thank him very much for all his help and left the hotel to go th Marriott. I have to say that the staff that we came across at the Condado Plaza Hotel was very nice to us. From Mr. Jean Pierre Aponte(front desk manager) to Yaritza and Fernando at the front desk as well as Kaira Velez. They were all very helpfull and apologetic to our situation and I know thy tried to do the best they could under the circumtances. They all agreed that they will not prepare for the magnitude of this Political Convention. I spoke to many of the staff from the Parking Attendant to the bellman and of course the front desk. I can see how stressed out they were. It seem to me that the guests at this Political Covention brought into the hotel all their friends an relatives from the Island and they took over this Hotel and did whatever they felt like it. We saw a lot of young people cursing and running up and down the stairs with open beer cans in their hands and also in the floors. There was no way for anyone of the guests that were not part of this Political Convention like us to relax and enjoy the comfort that this hotel should be capable of offering their guests. This was a complete chaos. This is exactly the best way to described the how this hotel looked the almost 2 days that we stood there. Will I come back to this hotel? Not in the near future. Will I recommend this hotel? Not for a long while! My advice!!! Please make sure that if you have a comfirmed reservation with a specific request at this hotel make sure that it is available and guarantee before checking in because you will be in the same situation my family and I was.

He and his family have been there before, and he recommended that we stay at the Condado Plaza Hotel & Casino. So we booked our round trip tickets (which were just under $450.00 for the two of us!) for San Juan through Delta and headed out on the morning of Aug. 5. I actually read tons of reviews about the hotel before we left, and there seemed to be more positives than negatives, so I wasn't worried at all about the trip. My boyfriend was there before they renovated the entire hotel, so he was amazed at how different it looked. I work for Starwood Hotels & Resorts, here in Atlanta, so I know a little about the hospitality industry. The main lobby was very colorful and vibrant, much like the whole city of San Juan. The front desk agents were very courteous and pleasant. The guy eyed us right away, and we were taken care of quickly. Check-in wasn't until 4pm, but we got there at 2:30. I informed the reservation agent when we booked our stay that we were going to be there early, and she definitely made a note of that because it took us about 5 minutes to get our room key as soon as we walked in the hotel! I thought that was awesome. We got the Bahia Vista room, which was located in the other tower. We got a little of each view-bay, ocean, city-which was nice. The bed was so soft! The floor was all tile, which made it great. They had a flat screen tv, and a mini fridge in the room. We loved the glass shower doors and the bathroom door was cool. You had to slide the entire door to open/close it. Housekeeping was awesome. Our room was cleaned everyday, around the same time in the morning because we always had plans to go out, and by the time we would get back, the room was spotless. The bathroom amenities were always refreshed and we always had clean towels. In-Room Dining was quick. Although I did have a few connection/waiting problems on the phone. It really wasn't a big deal, but I don't like to be put on hold for more than a minute and a half. But I'm sure it wasn't their fault. The main thing I enjoyed was being on the balcony, watching cars below and people riding their bikes. It was beautiful at night, too, with the city lights and the sound of the waves crashing. We went down to the pool as soon as we got there on the first day. The servers were really cool. They have 4 pools at the hotel, with a jacuzzi. They were all nice. We also gambled a little while we were there. Their casino was relatively big, and the dealers were really friendly. Everyone that worked there was always smiling and greeting us, which made our stay even more great. We ate at their Italian restaurant one night, and their food was delicious. The server was also very pleasant to speak with. Most of the time, we just bought food at the local grocery store, and stocked up our mini fridge, or ate at the local restaurants in town because the food was cheaper, but still yummy! The concierge team was very nice. They gave us directions to certain places, gave us restaurants to try, and other information we needed to get by. They were always willing to help in every way they could. It wasn't hard trying to get a taxi there. They were all really nice, too. Overall, our stay at the Condado Plaza Hotel & Casino was amazing.

The first is very minor: The shower is freestanding and the lack of curtain causes a leak of water onto the floor. Easily remedied with an extra floor mat. The second is that the front desk reps are only utilized for checking in and out. Every other service is handled by the concierge. That is fine, however there is at most 3 people at that desk at a time and during certain times of the day you may have a considerable wait time to speak with a concierge, which can be rather inconvenient when you need something simple and there are 5 people at the check in desk just standing around. All in all, we will definitely return to Puerto Rico, and the Condado Plaza Hotel and Casino, will be top on our list of places to stay! Take full advantage of the incredible Concierge service! Take advantage of happy hour at the poolside bar. If you are looking for restaurants outside the hotel, there are several in the Condado area in walking distance from the hotel. Definitely Ropa Vieja Grill very close to hotel. Take all the tours the concierge recommends except the Bacardi tour.

Because American Airlines loses an inordinate amount of luggage on flights into San Juan (nearly 50 people on our plane alone), we showed up at nearly midnight. We were told our room was ready but after hearing a very loud private party off of the lobby, my wife wisely asked if our room was anywhere near it. Yes, they said, it is directly one floor above. The young man at the desk cheerfully offered to move us across the street for the night, from our \"Ocean View\" room to the more expensive \"Laguna Family Suites\" at no additional charge. The hotel is large enough that it is located on both sides of the street. Our original side was the ocean side while the more expensive suites were not. We have three complaints about the room, one of which also affected the other room. First, I offered to sleep in the living room which contained two twin beds since I get up early. The sheets smelled of mildew but by that time I was just happy to have a bed. Secondly, we were told we would get some complimentary toothbrushes, etc. to clean up as American Airlines no longer provides them when your luggage is lost. The complimentary toiletries showed up over an hour later, after one o'clock in the morning. The second set (!) showed up at three with the security officer. Thirdly, the view from our room was ghastly, (photo provided) viewing the hotel entrance directly ahead and aN entirely vacant and boarded up 15 or so story hotel complete with graffiti and sans doors or windows. Quite a letdown from an \"Ocean View\" room- especially for hundreds of dollars per night! The last complaint I have against the room; actually both rooms, is that the bathroom doors slide squeekingly along tracks much like a mirrored wardrobe in your bedroom. There are no bottom tracks however, and as the door is wood frame with frosted glass on the inside, it allows shadowy views and a variety of sounds best left to the imagination of the reader. You had better know your companion very well, indeed, for if you don't, you will certainly know much more than you may have wanted to about their bathroom \"habits.\" No sounds are spared as the door wobbles partiallly open at the bottom under the air flow of the air conditioning (which was excellent, by the way). The next day we finally moved into our promised room, albeit late for an unexplained reason, since we had checked availabililty before we left back to go to the airport on our vacation to search for our errant luggage and were told the room was ready already. Well, it wasn't and we trudged back to the old room until the room we booked was finally made ready. Except for the aforementioned squeeky, semi-trackless door, the room was fine. I would have called the room \"semi' ocean view however, as we saw as much rooftop and side of the hotel as we did ocean. The only other complaint concerns the laundry room. My wife seems to do so much laundry all the time it must make her very happy to do it! Nevertheless, three of the four washers were out of order and as she finished the second load of laundry she said she think the last of the four dryers broke. On the positive side, the people were nice, it was reasonably clean, and had great air conditioning. We travel the Caribbean each summer and realize the value of good air. We did have an evening walk down the street, and although many storefronts were empty, we did find a nice Puerto Rican restaurant that offered very good local fare at a reasonable price. My wife and daughter did not feel ill at ease about walking back to the hotel about three blocks as I ordered the food to go. Within walking distance was a Subway sandwich shop and a Chili's but little else. One does have to remember, though, that although a possession of the U.S., Puerto Rico and most of the Caribbean remain third world countries in respect to accommodations. Oh, and we have also discovered there are airlines out there with third world service with delayed flights because of \"service problem\" and lost and delayed luggage which cry for mercy as they continue to lose money. They have as much of my sympathy as they had for our plight. Seriously, though. We were told by hotel concierge staff, taxi drivers, and cruise personnel that to avoid most of the late and broken plane issues as well as the high incidence of lost baggage to allow at least one extra day travel time each way in and out of San Juan Airport!

This was my second time to visit Puerto Rico and I felt I had done my research about which hotels we might want to stay in as we wanted to stay in the Metro area. I had read a lot of the reviews on the Condado Hotel and felt there were more good ones than bad. I should have paid more attention to the bad ones. At least they fit our experience more than the good ones. We arrived on Sunday around 10:30 p.m. and I expected check in to go quickly as we had reservations and it was late in the evening. The hotel lobby looked as it had online in the photos. We had reserved a room with a private balcony overlooking the Atlantic with a king size bed. The room we were assigned had two double beds. So, down the slow elevators and back to the front desk where we had to wait to have this corrected. There were three people working the front desk, two of them were busy and the third one was staring at a computer screen and never looked up or asked us or anyone else if we needed help. So, we waited for the person that had originally helped us. The room assignment was corrected and we went back up to the new room. It was correct this time. The room also appeared as it had online but was not as clean as I had expected. The shower in the bathroom had mildew on the ceiling and the floor did not look vacuumed. The room also had a musty smell. There does not appear to be a ventilation fan in the bathroom. There was moisture on the window looking out to the balcony because of the humidity and you could see where some previous occupant of the room had written [--] You. You would think housekeeping could wipe the outside of the window between room occupants. The room seemed to be cleaned better after the first night. Note to traveler: make sure you put the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Clean This Room\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd sign on your door when you leave your room in the morning. The other thing with housekeeping, which seemed to be the only friendly staff, was that they only put one wash cloth in the room everyday. There were two of us staying in the room and everyday I had to ask for another wash cloth. Back to the first 5 minutes in the room. We proceeded to get settled in the room and the power went out in the hotel. We were now standing in a dark room with just the glow through the window illuminating the room. I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t really blame this on the hotel but it was one of the first of many annoying things to come. After about 15 minutes of on again off again episodes and one scary moment of being stuck in the elevator for a brief moment power was restored. The pool area is ok but I have been to several that make this really rank. The pool is opened 24 hours but make sure you bring a towel from the room if you go down in the evenings or you will not have a towel They say they provide towels at the pool but the towel shack closes around 6:00 p.m. One night I had gone down to use the hot tub and lay by the pool and enjoy the moonlight and the sounds of the ocean and felt stalked by a security guard which kept looking and walking around me as if I didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t belong there. I almost confronted him and asked him to stop but decided to let it go. If you are going to have drinks at the pool bar be prepared to pay around $20 for two basic cocktails. Note to traveler: go to the store down the block and buy some rum, a bottle of coke and some plastic glasses and take your drink to the pool. Not one time did a waitress or waiter come over to ask if we needed a drink or anything. Another afternoon we had walked out to the pool area, set our things down and proceeded to the lagoon (beach) area to put our feet in the water and on the way back in we were stopped and asked to see the key card to our room to prove that we were hotel guest while other people just filed on by. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m glad I had it in my swim suit pocket! I am 51 years old, clean cut and well dressed and had just walked out to the pool area from the hotel 5 minutes prior to this and he didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t say \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m sorry\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd or explain why he was asking. Yes, I was insulted!!! After that we really didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t make use of the pool area. If you want to go to the beach go to Escambron, down the road towards Old San Juan, or Carolina beach in Isla Verde. Both are part of the Blue Flag program. If you go to El Yungue stop by Luquillo beach on your way back. We rented a car from Budget which is in the tower across the street also part of the Condado Hotel. The Budget Rental people were great. We got the car we wanted and quickly. We were able to return it at the airport which is what we wanted to do. Note to traveler: if you rent a car be prepared for the parking situation at the Condado. You have to take a ticket out of the machine to get in the parking garage, pray you can find a parking spot and then when you are ready to go out again you have to take it to the valet desk which is located outside in front of the hotel, write your room number, your name and sign it, hand it to a valet and get it validated and then go get your car out of the garage. You must do this every time you come and go which is very annoying! They do not explain this system well and sometimes it went smoothly and other times the person behind the parking desk acted like they didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t know what was going on and would tell you something completely different from what you had been doing. They tell you that in the end you will be charged a flat rate of $15.00 a day but this system does not instill confidence. We saw several people as confused as we were with the whole parking process. Also, just because you are a hotel guest does not mean you are guaranteed a parking space. There is an area designated for hotel guest but no one monitors who parks in these spots. If you come and go 3 to 4 times a day there are times you will return to the garage to see the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Garage Full\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd sign and have no option but to park down the street in a public lot or valet park at the hotel. We had no option but to valet park one time and when we came to get the car they didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t know where it was at first. Plus the valet parking rate is much more expensive. Note to traveler: if you have been out to a beach other than the one at the hotel there is no alternate elevator to your room you will have to go through the lobby. During the week with business men, etc. this can seem uncomfortable. We did not spend any time in the Casino as that is not our thing and we did not eat at the Strip House as we have one where we live. We did eat at the Italian restaurant which was not good. If you like Italian food don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t get it here. You also can get breakfast in this same space in the morning and we ate breakfast twice and it was fine. If you like coffee, request the Puerto Rican coffee otherwise they bring regular coffee. We did try the bar but after no wait person came to take our order we went up to the bar to order and the bartender just continued to talk to someone and ignored us even after saying \u00e2\u20ac\u0153can we get a drink?\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd We gave up at that point. Another annoying thing at this hotel is the doors to the rooms. It is impossible to close them without a loud slam and I mean loud. So, early mornings and late evenings you are aware of the comings and goings of other guests while you are sleeping or relaxing in your own room. In general, I felt the staff was rude and unaccommodating. I think this is more of a business and convention hotel than a vacationing one. Based on our experience I was expecting check out to be an unpleasant experience and to our surprise it wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t. We were in a long line waiting to get to the front desk when a very nice, official looking hotel representative asked if anyone was checking out and we indicated we were. He assisted us and even showed us where we could print our boarding passes for our flight home. This was the first time I felt we received the kind of service I had expected the 5 nights we stayed considering the quality and rating this hotel has or professes to have. Friday morning there was a political figure in town in addition to the people arriving at the hotel for the weekend and it really seemed like hotel staff had a wake up call. They even started to say \u00e2\u20ac\u0153thank you\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. I know we were staying at this hotel during the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153off season\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd but service is service. The second day of our trip we decided to salvage our vacation mood by lowering our expectations and proceeded to have a good vacation. I feel if we had stayed somewhere else we might have had a great vacation. I would not stay here again.

Make sure you go to the back of Waikiki out the door to be literally experience a drink or dinner overlooking the waves. Best place to be!!! Their beer is 2.50 which is cheapest next to going to the corner store which is close to Max and Charlie's pizza. They have the best pizza ever as everything is fresh.

After initially booking at the Gran Melia in PR I read some negative reviews on tripadvisor and switched to the Condado Plaza. I can't emphasize how happy I am that I did. We arrived on Monday morning and checked right in without a wait. There was a problem with the first room we were given. The sliding door to the balcony had been left open and the bathroom was infested with mosquitos. Once we brought this to managements attention we were immdiately given another comparable room without hesitation. Every staff member we encountered throughout our stay was effiicient, friendly and polite. The head of guest relations Henry Neuman was very present and approachable. Javier was my favorite porter at the door. Any negative seeming issues we had were quickly dealt with including a leak in our room on our last night there. I also had a mishap with a dryer in the small laundry room on the premises that ate my quarters. It was so nice to be able to wash my clothes and not pack up a suitcase full of sand that a dryer that ate my quarters was a small price to pay for the convenience of not having to go off the grounds to do laundry. I would echo other reviewers sentiments that the food by the pool was very pricey and of mediocre quality. After one lunch there (we were too tired upon arrival to go forraging outside the hotel for a meal) we did not eat at the hotel at all. Having a Starbucks on the grounds helped get the day started with ease and we ate off the grounds for the rest of the day during our stay. During the week the action at the pool was manageable and it was not difficult to find an empty chair. Our ten year old son had a blast on the water slide and made friends while waiting on line. We had Diana as our server for poolside drinks and she was lovely and available without being overbearing. Like other reviewers I observed that there were people at the pool who did not seem to be guests of the hotel. When entire families show up at a resort pool in street clothing it does seem a bit suspect and I saw that more than once during the week. However once the weekend hit and the hotel was at what seemed to be capacity they began issuing wrist bands with the towels. The lagoon beach is small but had some fun snorkeling. We saw squid, octopus, puffer fish, trumpet fish and numerous other colorful tropical fish.I would suggest if you like to snorkel bring your own gear. This is a resort and they charge resort prices for gear rental. Yes, as mentioned in other reviews the elevators are slow. It seems as though there just aren't enough elevators for the amount of people the hotel can hold. During the week it really wasn't a problem but when the hotel filled up on the weekend with conventions and weddings it became more noticeable. Most people just took it in stride. The rooms were kept very clean. I would call the decor tropical West Elm. My one complaint about the rooms would be that the walls were a bit on the thin side. We got around mostly by cab after one attempt to go local and take the bus that resulted in a wait that was over an hour. If you like surfer communities go to Ocean Park beach and go to Pinky's or Top Hamburger for lunch. Everywhere we went in Puerto Rico the service was friendly and a refreshing change of pace. The absolute highlight of our vacation was the restaurant Marmalade in Old San Juan. Due to my line of work I have eaten food prepared by all the best chefs in the country including Batali, Flay, Morimoto, et al. and the food and service at Marmalade was by far the best I have ever experienced. They were completely unfazed by our bringing a ten year old in with us and did everything they could to accomodate his picky habits and make us comfortable. The whole experience was so outstanding we went back a second night without him. If you go to Marmalade ask to sit in Bernice's section. She undertands the concept of sublime service.

It was outstanding! We spent a little more money and got the ocean view in the Ocean Tower (the tower with the casino). I would recommend to anyone to spend the extra money to get this view. Waking up in the morning and going to sleep at night to this view is amazing. After a night of losing some money in the casino, we would come back into the room and go out onto the balcony and listen to the waves crashing. When we first arrived, we were greeted by the workers right away who offered to help us to our room. Check in went smoothly and soon enough we were going up to our room (Room 924) The room we had was beautiful. As soon as you walked in, you saw the bathroom with sliding doors. Yes, the bathroom does not lock. But honestly, it's not a big deal. I mean if you see the doors closed then obviously someone is using it. So there weren't any issues there. I know one review said that you could see through the opened portions of the sliding door. You really can't see that much. But think about who you're going with. I was with my boyfriend. We weren't peaking in on each other when we were in the bathroom. I also know that one review said that the sink drains slow. It is kinda slow, but also not a big deal. Nothing overflowed. The only way I can see it overflowing is if you put the faucets on full blast. I don't feel a need to do that. The closet and mini fridge were in the bathroom as well which was a little weird but got used to it. The bathroom is a very large bathroom. After the bathroom, you were in the living area. There was a very comfortable bed, with big fluffy pillows, a nice couch, a little coffee table, a desk with a flat screen TV, and plenty of lights. Finally, there was the balcony which had a little table with 2 chairs, and awesome view of the Atlantic Ocean. The hotel itself is very modern and brightly lit with different colors, and had a beautiful fishtank. There were 3 pools (one pool was only 3 1/2 feet but had a swim up bar and a waterslide for the kids, there was a salt water pool that had water filtered in from the Atlantic, there was a lap pool to swim laps, finally there was a jacuzzi). There were always activites for kids and adults to take part in, occasionally they would give out popsicles at the pool. I never had to fight for a lounge chair. The beach is a little small, but it was nice. It was sort of in its own inlet. The most important part is that the water was clean! They do have there own fitness center and I have to say it looked very nice. All the latest cardio and weight machines were in there and you need to use your room key to get in so it's ONLY for hotel guests. The casino was quite large for the casinos in Puerto Rico. I've never been to Las Vegas and I'm sure the casinos in Vegas are better but Vegas is known for their casinos. The Condado casino was very nicely kept, nice people working there and very helpful. They had everything you could want: slot machines, roullette, baccarat, blackjack, 3 card poker, and texas hold 'em. There might even be more that I don't rememeber. We booked a day trip to El Yunque rainforest through the hotel. They also had other really interesting excursions that you could do. The San Juan Public Transportation is very convenient. There is a bus stop located right outside the beach area which takes you to Old San Juan (it's only .75 cents each way and runs until 9 p.m.) We never ate in the Striphouse restaurant in the hotel. We're from NYC and we figured we could always go to a steak house in NYC. So we opted for authentic restaurants most nights. The hotel is located on Ashford Avenue, which is a huge strip with many hotels and restaurants, and many hotels that are being built or added on to. We felt very safe at night walking on Ashford Avenue. Most mornings for breakfast we either ate at the Italian restaurant in the hotel (nice size portions but a little pricey - the pancakes were bigger then my head) or we walked down the block to Hacienda Don Jose (really good food, good price, amazing view). We tried a new place for dinner each night ( Ajili Mojili, Ikakos, Cafe Angel, Ropa Vieja). Our favorite restaurant was Ropa Vieja. Service was outstanding and food was out of this world! I highly recommend this place. Before we knew it, the week was over and we DID NOT want to go home. We will definitely be coming back in the future! It was just a fun, amazing, yet relaxing trip!!

I stayed in the Condado Plaza on Memorial Day Weekend. Just to state the facts, I am a very well travelled individual and rarely complain to management (I just don't go the place anymore), I was also most of the time out and about. Also, Hillary Clinton was staying in this hotel on that weekend, so there was a lot of security around. Stayed a(group of 5) on the main ocean tower on a (2) city view room. Pros: 1. Beautiful Hotel, newly remodeled rooms with all the amenities. 2. Lobby very contemporary, and grounds impeccable. No complaints, except elevators were too tiny for such big buildings (2 towers), therefore were slow or were packed and had to wait two or three times for it (if there's space go in, even if it's going up). 3. Great big bathrooms, although there were no doors to close (sideways, gap between door and wall). So, technically anyone could see through the double door. No problem in our case. Cons: It might have just been my room?? 1. Some minor issues during my stay such as remote for the LCD screen tv did not work properly (could not regulate volume). 2. The curtain and blackout shades could not be closed since the stick to move it side to side was broken (stuck) and thrown in the terrace (housekeeper should be aware and report those things). 3. The door that lead to the terrace would slam shut since the top part of the door (don't know how it's called, mechanism to close slowly) was broken. I could see that the Lagoon Tower had new doors and windows that the city view ocean tower did not remodeled. 4. The other room's mini-fridge was not cooling. Other minor problems, such as water splashing out to the floor from the shower, are true. Did eat at the Japanese place (great service and food), had breakfast at Gusto di Italia (great service and food), and the Strip House (excellent). In other words, restaurants were excellent, as well as the pool area, lobby, grounds, etc. Did get a great rate by booking directly from their website (4 nights for the price of 3 special).

I would agree with the other reviewers in that the hotel has a very trendy, young, modern and comfortable feel. The pictures definitely dont do it justice. The restaurants were very good at the Condado. We had dinner in the italian restaurant and the food was excellent. There is also steak house (The Strip) and a starbucks coffee on the lower level. The hotel has a great pool thats open 24 hrs and lots of seating. The beach to the left is somewhat small and a little rough, but we still enjoyed it very much. For those who like to have a change of scenary, we spent all of our pool time at the Condado, a little time at the smaller Condado beach and most of our beach time about .25 mile east of Condado to the bigger beach (which is very easy to get to). My wife and I like to walk and roam around so we actually checked out the other nearby hotels. From our brief comparison of the beach, pool and aesthetics of each hotel along the strip, I would definitely suggest either the Condado, La Concha or the Marriott. All three had great atmospheres, great pool areas and nice beach areas (specifically La Concha and Marriott). The only cons I had about the Condado were 1) the long lines during check in; 2) we stayed in the City Vista which was a really nice room but had a small bathroom. I would definitely recommend the Condado Plaza.

It was extremely crowded most nights and they had a bunch of various conferences and meetings there. It seems to be a big place for locals to meet. My biggest complaint is the cost of everything here. We aren't cheap people. But $50 for breakfast downstairs - and a very average one at that - is ridiculous. In-room PPV movies ranged from $12.99 to $24.99. $24.99 for a movie. Seriously. Also, they charged $16 per day for parking. I have never been to a hotel that charges their own guests for parking. The mistake we made was not doing enough research about the beach area here, and we love the beach, so we were pretty disappointed. The beach at Condado Plaza is tiny and always crowded, so expect to drive elsewhere for a decent beach experience. Loquillo Beach, about 45 minutes away, is very pretty. Unless you don't want the hassle of driving yourself (which I can't really blame you for, since traffic is horrible here) don't book trips through the hotel, because they are twice what you would pay if you book them on your own. Traffic is hideous. Always allow an extra hour or more to get where you're going. The highlight of our trip was El Yunque, about one hour from Condado. Getting there is a bit of an adventure but once there, it's very easy to navigate. Do not miss La Mina Falls - it's amazing! And bring a swimsuit, so you can splash around in the falls. At km 11.3 there is a small restaurant called \"Yuquiyu Delights\" -- the food is AWESOME! Especially the fried green plantain, One of the best meals we had. Old San Juan was another highlight. Fort San Cristobal is incredible. We purchased a ton of local rum and coffee at the SuperMax - coffee was $4 a pound! We were happy to finally find something at a decent price. Haha. I would absolutely return to Puerto Rico, but would probably break up the trip a bit. I would stay somewhere closer to a nice beach because we love to snorkel and swim. Then, I would spend a couple of days closer to El Yunque. I would be happy to answer any questions about San Juan or El Yunque.

I have to say that i was impressed with the change of this hotel. It is absolutely beautiful. The problems start when you do your check in. We had booked a room for 5 days, when we got there they had it for 3. When my husband asked to get the 2 extra days he mentioned the special that they had, stay 4 nights and the 5th one is free, the girl said that we cannot have it because our reservation was for 3 days. My husband explained to her again that we wanted to stay 5 days not 3 and that we like to get the special but the girl at front desk didn't even tried to get the special she just said no that we can't have it. Got to the room and it was comfortable and well decorated. We had what they called a family suite. Two twin beds for the kids, separated from our side of the bed room. Also we had the coffee machine and the microwave. Everything was nice and clean. The pool on the Ocean tower is really nice and has a cool slide that kids and adults enjoy. The valet was another little problem. Our car was never there when we got to the valet. We always had to wait, not even if we called 20 minutes ahead of time. No opening the doors for me or the kids. Not even because we gave them good tips, and i say good because we are not cheap people! One night we ordered room service, just desserts and coffee and it took them an hour and 20 minutes to deliver the food. By the time they came me and the kids were half asleep. The night before our check out they forgot to clean our rooms. I came to take a shower and found the room exactly the same way we left it. Had to go to the room next door were a housekeeping lady was getting a room ready for check in to ask her for towels. She gladly helped me even though our room was not part of her job and she also made the report. An hour later or so the housekeeping supervisor called asking when was a good time for us to have the room cleaned. I asked for a couple of ours because me and my family were trying to get ready to go out to dinner. Well a house keeping lady came right away even though I told them that I needed some time to get my boys showered and ready and my husband needed to do the same. She kept coming back every 20 minutes because she needed to go to dinner and wanted to clean our room before taking her break. Well she cleaned our room while we were getting ready. At the end of our stay when my husband went to do the check out they asked him how was our stay to which he answered \"It left a lot to say\", she didn't even bother to asked what went wrong. Just gave him the receipt. Now one thing I do have to say the bartenders at the pool bar are the best. Joey, David, Sterling and the girls(they were all different every day) are the best the hotel have. With smiling faces all the time and their service is above and beyond. To all of them\" Job well done\". My husband and I go on vacation and stay at hotels at least 3 times a year. From the Ritz, to EL Conquistador, Marriott to Holiday Inn, La Quinta...etc. And by far this has been the worst service we've had. So if you don't mind this issues, go ahead book your vacation.

We stayed when they were running a special of stay 3 nights and get the 4th free. So, the average room rate came out to be around $150.00 per night. I see a lot of people complaining about additional charges beyond the room rate. These are statutory charges that are imposed by Puerto Rico....so it dosen't matter where you stay you are paying the charges. Some hotels might include these in the rate so you have to inquire prior to booking. The staff was very courteous and friendly and seemed to want to help whenever they could. The property and the rooms where clean and recently renovated. You read all these reviews about people who are complaining about the property. Well realize your not staying at the El San Juan Hotel, Intercontintenal, etc...where you are paying $350.-500. per night. And to be honest with you I don't know how much better they would have been. The hotel is located in an accessible part of town where you are not locked into eating at the hotel. There a places within walking distance from the hotel. A great place we ate at was Ropa Vieja. We also got upgraded to an ocean view for no charge that was absolutely beautiful. The previous review complained about the ocean being closed. We were there at the same time and the the surf was extremely dangerous and you wouldn't have wanted to go near the water. Is it the hotels fault? Casino is small but more than adequate. Pool was very nice...fresh and saltwater...swim up bar....small public beach in a bay area not right on the ocean. Night life in the hotel was quiet even though it lent itself to a South Beach environment. But actually liked it being quiet. If I was young might have been an issue.

I suggest a better parking system.

We arrived at the Condado Plaza and it looked amazing, the lobby was beautiful just like the pictures. The hotel has a very nice miami feel to it. It took forever to get to our room because there was only one elevator working in the lobby so everyone had to cram into this tiny elevator. We finally checked into our room right away and the room was very nice and spacious. The only thing is that our balcony was flooded with water, because they failed to tell us that they were doing construction on the outside of the building. We had to go to the lobby and ask for another room. We then went to look at another room which had the same problem. Finally after looking at 2 different rooms we found one that didnt have a flooded balcony and went directly to the pools. The pools were very nice, but the beach is so disappointing very small and there is rocks and shells all over so you feel like you are walking on glass. The beach is public so anyone can go there and even stray dogs were running around. We ordered food at the restuarant by the pool, we had a hamburger and fries and chicken fingers and fries and two drinks the bill came out to $67.00. You have to pay $2.50 extra for slices of cheese. On the second day, after spending the day by the pool my boyfriend and I went to our room to relax a bit, upon entering the room we discovered that there was two men on the balcony painting. They were there for about 15 minutes and then when we went to the balcony and we realized that the balcony was flooded again and the construction workers had left big pieces of paint chips on the floor. We then went to the front desk and complained again, they gave us a resort credit for our inconvenience At this point we were a little fed up, we payed extra money for an ocean view and we couldnt really enjoy it. On the third day we so unhappy because we encountered the same problem once again , we decided to check out and check into another hotel in Isla Verde. If you ever decide to go to San Juan, this hotel is nice, but dont go there unless you are sure that they are completely done with their construction. When I made the reservation they told me that they were done with construction, which was not the truth. The area around the hotel can be a little boring, and the beach is very disappointing.

From the outside, I felt like I was going to be staying at a top notch hotel with impecable service. While my overall stay was pleasant, I had mixed feelings about the hotel. PROS: It is definitely in the best location. Situated at the end of the Condado strip within walking distance of shopping, cafes, rest. and other hotels while just steps from the bridge to old san juan where you can find the best nightlife in the carribean. The pool area is very relaxing. You have many options. You can sit in a shaded area on a lounge chair along the larger pool, or roast in the sun by the smaller pool. Or, for a perfect, relaxing nap you can chill on one of the hammocks strung between palm trees on the main lawn overlooking the ocean. The overall atmosphere down by the pool is amazing and sure to wipe away any stress you came down with. What makes it even better is the outstanding pool staff of waitresses and bartenders. They were so friendly, fast and personable that I was compelled to leave a very generous tip. However, the pricing of the food made me choke!!! $13.00 for a turkey wrap..Even in NY we do not have prices like that. The cleaning staff do a great job as well and are friendly. CONS: As great as the hotel appears to look from the outside, I could not believe how they overlook small details that really ruined my initial impression of the hotel. For example, the window in my room was so filthy and dingy that I could barely get a clear view. My room also had many marks and scrapes on the walls. I also noticed paint peeling from the outside of the hotel near the balconies. For a hotel that just underwent major renovations, I don't see how they can allow these very visable eyesores to exist; especially since it would not take much effort to fix. That makes me wonder how much they do care about customer service and appearance. If they want to classify themselves as a \"luxury hotel\", you cannot have these conditions. Also, when I checked in, I had to wait for 10 min. while the clerk was on the phone. And, he was not friendly at all. When I asked him about late check out, he gave me an attitude. Not the right thing to do to a first time guest. I was also a little dispointed with the beach. Having paid the $$, I would expect to have a little more privacy on the beach. They seem to allow all the locals to use the beach which got very crowded and noisy. If I wanted to go to a public beach, I could have stayed at a much cheaper hotel in downtown San Juan and walked to a beach. Overall, I did enjoy my stay. But as a frequent carribean traveler, you get more critical of the little details that make a big difference. With the exception of my \"check in clerk\", the staff was very professional and accomodating. I did get the late check out without much resistance and the girl who checked me out explained the bill in great detail and even found a mistake from the parking garage...THANK YOU!!! I would stay here again just because of the location of the hotel and the outstanding pool and lounge area. But please, rethink about allowing the beach to be open to the public and take care of those little eyesores. They can really bring the appearance down and make the hotel look sloppy and dirty.

He answered all of my questions and concerns prior to coming and even gave us a complimentary upgrade to the ocean view room. Thank gosh! The view and the sounds of the ocean can't be beat.

My boyfriend is a big gambler and he had a great time in the casino too. I read a recent review of the Italian restaurant's service - I must agree that was probably the only downfall of the entire place - it took over 35 minutes to get our breakfast. BUT, I guess we didn't mind so much b/c we just enjoyed the view and being on vacation, we weren't in a rush to go anywhere! Oh! And with regards to the steakhouse, please note that you'll pay a pretty penny for drinks. I think we stopped in for 2 glasses of wine and it cost us about $40! However, there are so many great restaurants, shops, etc. right next to the hotel and down the street, so there honestly is never a lack of anything to do, see, etc. In fact, we had a tough time trying to pinpoint where we should eat next! Also, everywhere we went, the people of Puerto Rico/Condado/Old San Juan were so incredibly gracious and hospitable.

Once we checked in, we were assigned a room and had to walk back over the skywalk, past the casino to the elevator, hauling our carry-ons and coats.

We ate at the sushi bar and at the Italian cafe and were pleased with the food and service. After the first evening we rarely saw people in the halls or cafes. It was difficult to feel that we were at a nice resort -- there was absolutley no resort feel to the place. Walking time and again into the empty first floor lobby was just not pleasant! Our major gripe was with the Concierge. We called and asked for restaurant recommendations. We were told that ____ (home of the Pina Colada) was great! We went and were served food which appeared to us to have been cooked much earlier in the day. The next day we called the Concierge again and asked for further recommendations. We were given the name of the same place. Trying to get something different we asked the Concierge for another suggestion. We were told she was busy at the moment and would call us back. She never did, although we waited. So, we went to Marmalade in Old Town San Juan and were delighted. The call back from the Concierge never came, but we didn't care.

The hotel is beachfront with lounge chairs on the ocean side and has a salt water pool and freshwater pool on the ocean side. The pools were well kept, but a little crowded with guests. Nothing bad though. There are many lounge chairs near the pool and on the ocean side of the property as well as scattered hammocks to catch the ocean breeze. There are also some nice hidden places to take tropical background pictures. On the bay side there is a great pool. Not many guests realize this pool is there and therefore, it is not crowded no matter when you take a dip. The poolside also has lounge chairs and is uncrowded. There is also a nice jacuzzi near this pool. You will most likely have it to yourself. At night you can sit in the jacuzzi and listen to the coquis in the background. There is also a watersports pavilion (I think it's privately owned) at the bayside if you walk down the drive along side of the hotel. I rented a kayak. The employee took my room number to charge the rental to my room but the best part was I was never charged. I also noticed other non-motorized rentals, I particularly remember aqua cycles. You get to use the entire bay and even toward the ocean, if you dare. The casino is large and fun and is always happening at night. There are a lot of games to choose from and many people playing, creating a nice atmosphere. The hotel has various on site restaurants. The buffet was my favorite for breakfast. There was hot and cold varieties. Try it at least once. There is an amazing ocean view through the wall of windows. The ocean spray even sometimes hits the window. The location can't be beaten. Steps from the main hotel is the bus into Old San Juan. It stops running about 10 or 11, but a cab ride back later is reasonable. The hotel is also on the Condado hotel strip - great for food, fun, shopping, casino hopping, bars. There is even a small public beach on the ocean side if you walk down a ways.

Traveling with 3 small children, it was de rigueur for us to have this. Henry was great, and set us up in two fabulous rooms. Everything was new, shiny, clean, perfect!! The pool was clean and very nice. The poolside service from Sterling was exceptional. The elevator from the lobby level down tot he pool level was out of order during our stay, but the very attentive pool staff was always there to give me a hand with my 1-year old daughter's stroller down the stairs. The beach was great and the service was attentive and friendly. We were blessed with perfect weather despite nothing but rain for the three weeks prior. The Gusto d'Italia restaurant was a great option for our first evening dinner. It was family friendly, the food was hot, well presented, portions were appropriate, and they served our kids quickly (we'd had a long day of travel and quick, hot and good was what we needed!). I can't remember the name of the waitress who helped us, but she was outstanding and my 7-year old is still talking about her! Unfortunately I can't recommend them for breakfast--it was pretty bad, but that's not the hotel's doing, as they are unrelated to the hotel. That said, it's a huge convenience to have this restaurant there. The Strip House is open!! We didn't dine here, but it certainly looked like it would be a lot of fun and a great meal. The Starbucks right at the hotel is very convenient. My husband ran out for yogurt, fruit, fantastic coffee and delicious spinach empanadas and quesitos in the mornings. Yum! Sure, there's still some construction to be wrapped up, and the place looks a little sparse, BUT it is going to be absolutely spectacular. The decor is minimalist and modernist, with a rich color palette. Very tasteful and elegant. The room decor is in keeping with this same design, and everything flows very smoothly together. The music piping through the speakers is Vegas cool around the lobby bar area. This is going to be a rockin' happening place when it's all done!! Our entire experience at the Condado Plaza was really amazing. We were thrilled with how friendly, attentive and helpful the entire staff was--from the housekeeping folks to the upper management. We are already anticipating our next family vacation to Puerto Rico and will definitely include the Condado Plaza in our plans.

However, there were little things that made the stay at the Condado less than ideal. This is a fine place to drop your bags and go but I would not recommend it for couples wanting to snuggle and lounge. First, The Good: The great thing about the Condado is that it is half way between Isla Verde and Old San Juan so if you are interested in visiting those places, this may be the best location. The tiny beach attached to the hotel was perfect and the natural rock formations were a buffer to the strong waves that crash in making it an enjoyable place to swim. But watch your feet on the volcanic rocks that lurk at the bottom! The staff at the hotel was very friendly and attentive. The pool areas are open 24hrs so we were in the hot tub in the wee hours and were checked on and brought fresh towels by the security staff. Very nice! The drinks served by the pool were strong and tasty and we kept them flowing!! There are two towers. We chose to stay on the Bay side as construction is still happening on the Beach side. The Bay was beautiful to look at and that side of the hotel is very quiet. The other stuff: This is not the place to go for a romantic get away. The rooms are nothing special. There were visible cracks, water leak marks and broken moulding in the bathroom. The outside is still under construction. Months ago when we were booking the trip we were told that construction would be done before we arrived and we read about it being torn apart in reviews back in June. The trek to the main hotel which houses the casino and restaurants and has access to the main pool and beach areas, reminded me of being in the farthest ends of a Vegas resort. Having to take two elevator rides and walking down halls and across a bridge to get to the main hotel isn't ideal. Especially when one of the elevators was not working the whole time we were there. The food by the pool leaves much to be desired. I would recommend walking up the street and grabbing some local food or even a sandwich from Subway (yes, Subway is better than the pool food). If gambling is your thing, this casino is tiny. I would save my chips and head to El San Juan Hotel and Casino in Isla Verde. The Condado area as a whole seems to be in a state of rejuvenation. I'm sure the fact that we were there during low season had something to do with it. Although there are ritzy shops like Gucci and Cartier on the strip, there isn't much else going on. A few local restaurants but lots of construction which takes away from the overall landscape. Isla Verde would be a better place to stay if you want to lounge by the beach or Old San Juan if beach access is not as important to you.", "Date": "November 30, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "1.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "new jersey", "Title": "\u201cDirty room\u201d", "Author": "NewJerseyIraida", "ReviewID": "UR10761097", "Content": "I stood at this hotel while it was underconstruction.

We were in a lagoon view room in the lagoon tower. The hotel offers easy access to Old San Juan. There is only a small beach near the hotel. There is a lot of construction going on in that area, both inside the hotel and outside as well. The rooms have been completed, but they are still working on the lobby in the ocean tower. The construction area (the lobby, the walkway to the casino, and the casino) was a mess. Also, there was a jackhammer drilling in the casino during working hours. The room was nicely decorated with green and blue hues. The view of the lagoon was gorgeous. The bed was comfortable, and there was a flat screen HDTV. My husband complained that the TV was not set up properly (something about people's faces being improperly squished), and the content was not in HD. My husband says there was no way to adjust the aspect ratio on the TV (whatever that means). The glass shower in the bathroom leaked. Also, the sliding door to the bathroom did not offer a lot of privacy. The 2 guest elevators in the lagoon tower were down about half of the time. We used the service elevator at those times. Dining options in the hotel are limited. We tried Tony Roma's, where the food was sub-par. We ate breakfast at the Italian restaurant. My vegie omelette had an entire bell pepper chopped into it. The pancakes were gigantic and heavy, not light and fluffy. The fruit cup included canned fruit. We had better luck with more basic items, like oatmeal, poached eggs, and toast. We had room service a few times. Service was good and the chocolate cake was yummy. We took full advantage of a $300 resort credit offered by the hotel. We used it for parking for our rental car, dining, and in-room movies. There is a large selection of in-room movies. The hotel offers some nice touches, like fresh flowers in the common areas. The renovated gym looked pretty nice. However, I would not recommend staying at this hotel until the construction is completed (supposedly in late November 2007). With the unsightly mess and the noise, the hotel does not offer a restful, peaceful environment that I would want on a vacation.

Honestly, I hardly even noticed that there was any construction going on at all unless I was walking to the Casino through the skywalk. The pools at the Condado Plaza are so relaxing and beautiful, not to mention clean. My boyfriend and I seemed to especially like the lap pool which was away from the other pools and seemed more private. We ordered room service twice and the service was so fast! Not to mention the food was great. The Casino was excellent, until we lost all of our 600 dollars that we had won. (not the hotels fault) We tried the Italian restaurant at the hotel. We especially liked the Calamari for an appetizer and the Lobster Pasta as an entree. I actually happened to bump into Henry several times.

After a lot of research, I chose the hotel based on location and price. I knew it was undergoing renovations (as is every hotel in the Caribbean in the summer off-season) but I e-mailed the hotel management before our visit and was assured that the renovations wouldn't affect our stay. We had to ask for help locating the check-in desk because it was not right where you enter the building, but up one level. Check in was quick and easy. We had booked a city vista room, but received a complimentary upgrade to an ocean vista room in the Ocean Tower. The room was great - the view, the decor, the bathroom, all of it. It was unlike any typical Marriott, Hilton, Holiday Inn, etc. but really unique. To get to our room, we came in through the Laguna Tower, walked up the one flight of stairs (never even thought about using the elevator that others have commented on for one flight), walked across the tunnel between the two buildings, and took the elevator up. Both elevators and the pool elevator in the Ocean Tower were always working and there was never a delay of any kind. We went in the casino once for about 20 minutes. It was busy at times, but never packed, and it looked like it could easily accomodate the guests. The pools were beautiful and scenic. Again, they were never really packed and there were never any problems getting a chair or anything. The bar at the pool was nice. The beach is small and also public, as is every beach in San Juan - even the Marriott and such have to let the public on, we learned. However, the staff would bring chairs for you if you wanted and the beach was plenty big enough for the people using it. The water was clear, calm, and warm. Having a taxi stand at the hotel was convenient for getting around. Prices are set so you know you're not getting scammed. The bus stop is also right at the hotel and easy to get into Old San Juan for 75 cents. There are lots of good Puerto Rican and other restaurants within a 5-10 block walk down Ashford Avenue. It was a nice stroll in the evening to find a restaurant if we weren't in Old San Juan. We never ate at the restaurants in the hotel because we'd rather experience the local flavors. Overall, our experience with the hotel, the staff, and the amenities was great. When the renovations are complete, it will be even nicer, but we had no complaints.

Booked our room online via their website and called the hotel 4-5 times personally to ask specific questions about our reservations and ammenities of the hotel. The people who answered the calls were very nice and promised we get the type of room we asked for (two double beds non-smoking). Their website talks about a cafe and lounge. Not once did the staff let us know that there cafe was CLOSED due to renovations and that there was NO lounge, live music, or club in the hotel. We opted to stay here due to the special promotion they had via their website which saved us a couple hundred bucks. After a very long flight over to San Juan and upon arriving to the hotel we found ourselves at what was the temporary check-in area. Only one person at the desk and upon checking in the guy told us that there were no rooms available that we reserved and that we would have to take a single king bed with an inflatable bed instead for the night. That was not satisfactory to us so we demanded something better. He went to the back and suddenly a room with a double bed became available. There was no apology and he said that reservations are only a preference and not gauranteed!!! They had only one elevator working the whole time. The other one was out of order. I do not understand why they did not fix this problem. The wait was long for the elevator and it got very crammed. The hotel staff also used this very same elevator as well which explains why it would get very crammed. The elevator problem should have been a top priority to fix asap. We were giving a room with the view of the lagoon which was very nice. Nicely renovated room. Comfy beds and pillows. The ac worked nicely but had trouble trying to fix the temp on the panel that got stuck. The bathroom had very nice fixtures and the shower worked great. The cleaning people were always very nice. We wanted to watch a movie. Called downstairs and they informed us that our tv was not hooked up to be able to watch the movie of our choice. It was a bummer. We ordered room service once and it was a super rip off, outrageous! The girl who took our order was very rude and to top it off our bill came out to around $70 for three people!!! Upon asking for an explanation it was simply said that \"the price is what the computer makes it to come out to.\" That was the last and only time we ordered room service. The Italian restaurant had the nicest staff. Very friendly and very helpful. The dinner dishes were great and tasted like the pasta was just freshly made! It took a bit longer than expected for the food to come to our table but well worth the wait. Tony Roma's was just alright. Jose was the best server there. He gave us tips about the town and it helped a ton. Long wait for food there too and they told us that they were out of hamburger buns for our orders. Starbucks across the ways was perfect for our breakfast needs. Even saw a famous Spanish soap opera actor in there! The location of the hotel is right in the middle. We hopped onto the bus to catch a ride to Old San Juan (only cost 75 cents each way) and the bus stop was right in front of the hotel. Also got onto the same bus to get to Plaza Las Americas, the gigantic mall in Hato Rey. Saved a lot of money that way than taking a cab everywhere. Very very convenient as far as location goes with the hotel. Convenience store across the street came in handy as well as the BIG souvenir shop down the street. Subway down on Ashford for a cheap dinner was nice too. They had all kinds of nice little bar/restaurants on the water and also the fancier more expensive restaurants too like Ropa Vieja (Cuban) and Ajili Mojili (Puerto Rican I'm guessing). They also had a big Chili's on Ashford too. I am glad that I didn't stay in Isla Verde, too far off from everything but the airport. To get to the pool we had to cross the overpath, pass the casino, pass the Italian restaurant, walk through the cold, paint smelling pathway and take the elevator down. The elevator didn't work at times so we had to take the stars and instead of it going down to the Pool, it would go all the way up to the 10th floor and come back to the pool area. Very odd how the elevators work in the hotel. Must get that fixed!!! The pools were very nice and open all the time. They had one main pool and also a saltwater pool which seemed like a nice added touch. They need more lighting for the pool area at nighttime. Could barely see anything in the pool area at night which could be very dangerous for the kids. The jacuzzi was big and always available. Happy hour had cheaply priced drinks at the pool bar which was nice. David the bartender made great drinks, but needed more help during happy hour which got very busy. They blocked off the entrance to beach in the evening time which seemed strange, but there was access another way it seems. They are currently doing contruction on the other side of the street which would be the location of the cafe and the main lobby of the hotel. The man at the front desk claimed that ALL of their rooms have been renovated which seemed to be true. Hopefully in a year all the contruction will be done and everything will be working properly and open. If not other hotels down the street would be an option for sure next time!

There is also a relaxing lagoon pool and a nice jacuzzi. So it was easy to relax at night. Security was always around, yet would stay out of the way. Oh yeah, they have a small but nice sandy beach and all pools are open 24/7. The are renovating so it is VERY noisy after 9am. Get a top floor if you can and it probably would be bearable. But then you have to deal with the slowest elevators in the history of mankind. It can easily take 15 minutes before it arrives. Then it will randomly stop at empty floors on its way down. The rooms are awesome! Very well designed, stylish, roomy with terrific bathrooms and showers. Wireless Internet is free, but it was down often. That could be because of the conference attendees overwhelming it. The location is okay. It's easy to get to places and there are plenty of touristy bars, restaurants and shops within walking distance. Oh yeah, the gym has been renovated too and has modern equipment, a jacuzzi and sauna (which was broken when I was there). Overall I really enjoyed the place. The noise was the only killer thing and that will go away then renovations are done (it looked like they had a lot to do, my guess is about a year from now).", "Date": "July 22, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "3", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Cincinnati, OH", "Title": "\u201cNot worth the price\u201d", "Author": "majid436", "ReviewID": "UR8212901", "Content": "The hotel was too expensive for what it had to offer.

A decision I didn't regret. It is the low season, and I got an amazing rate of $99 plus all taxes and fees. (note that the taxes and fees are pretty hight. Puerto Rico has a 9% tax for hotels without a casino and 11% on hotels with casino. Also the Hotel charges a \"Resort Fee\" of a whopping 14% of the rate per day.) The location has its pros and cons. On the western end of the Condado, there is no real beach. There is a small beach that is public right outside the hotel. It's not a bad little beach, but not as nice as other beaches east. On the plus side, you can walk to anything in the Condado. and for Old San Juan or Isla Verde, there are always a lineup of taxis outside day and night. A better option is the bus. The B21 line runs right past the hotel. This line runs from Old San Juan to the Plaza Las Americas mall, so it's easy access to both of these areas. To get to Isla Verde, take a taxi or a 15 minute or so walk to Ponce de Leon avenue and catch the A5 bus to Isla Verde. Remember all bus service stops around 9pm. They are renovating the hotel. Most of it is done, but the lobby and common areas in the main building are still being worked on. You have to enter and at the Lagoon Building across the street where the front desk is temporarily located and take the walkway to the main building's 2nd floor to access the casino, restaurants, and rooms. The rooms are absolutely enormous. I got a room on the 10th floor with the view of the lagoon, Miramar, and the mountains, and it is a gorgeous view. The rooms on the ocean view side of the hotel have balconies and are much more pricey. The room had a sofa and living room area, and a king size bed. the bathroom was equally gigantic, with a glass walk in shower stall right in the center of the bathroom. The shower stall could easily fit 3 people in it with room to spare! In the separate dressing area of the bathroom was the closet and drawers, with iron and board, and a small counter with coffeemaker and a refrigerator underneath. The other side of the bathroom had a huge marble counter with sink and hairdryer. Every amenity imaginable was in this room. Internet connection, plasma screen tv, huge marble desk, down bedding and comforters, and the enormous window that took up the whole wall giving a beautiful view of the highrises of Miramar and the mountains in the distance. Service is fantastic in this hotel! Everyone is very friendly and bends over backwards to help you. The casino is pretty nice too. One of the larger casinos in Puerto Rico, this still is nothing in size compared to the casinos of Vegas. There are about a dozen or so table games, and the rest is slots.However, what it lacks in size it makes up for with quick friendly drink service, friendly dealers, a smoke-free environment, and much lower minimum bets than in the high-end casinos in Vegas. Since there is not a huge, beautiful beach on premises, this hotel goes out of their way to make their pool area and gardens as nice as possible. There are 2 pools in the main building, and beautiful gardens with hammocks overlooking the ocean. Pool service is quick and friendly. Food is not bad at all but the restaurants and drinks are really overpriced. Eat elsewhere if you can. Overall, this hotel is best described as a 5 star hotel in a 3 star location.

Also, as the hotel is a bit away from activity of any sort it would be nice if the hotel either had some sort of in-house entertainment, like live music or DJ on the beach, or offered shuttles someplace like the mall or OSJ. There were a few restaurants nearby that had bars but they were always empty (as was most of this side of Ashford Ave.) so keep in mind its pretty quiet around Condado Plaza. The Italian restaurant in the hotel was a disappointment. The food was awful, I was there twice for dinner and once for breakfast and the breakfast burrito was the only passable food I had there. Starbucks was typical Starbucks which was fine if you wanted a beverage but the foodstuffs they sold didn't seem to move much at all and I had my doubts how fresh they were. Tony Roma's was a nice option with good service and decent food.

The beach is really a public beach with a lagoon of sorts, overrun with local teenagers. Although furnishings and materials are top-notch, workmanship in the hotel is marginal. We were in two rooms, and both had huge gaps in the bathroom door frames which made privacy impossible. The food and service at the hotel restaurants was mixed at best, and expensive.

The hotel is undergoing some renovation, but the work had minimal impact on our stay. The room was as described on the website. We were in one of the \"red\" rooms in the ocean tower. It had a view of the lagoon, and of the city of San Juan. The room was beautiful - very modern, the bed really comfortable, with high quality linens. The bathroom was large, with a glassed in shower. Room also had flat screen tv, coffee maker, iron, and safe. The balcony was large and came with 2 chairs and a small table. The housekeeping staff was very accommodating and kept the room immaculate. The only minor problems were that we had to ask for washcloths, and from the hotel photos, it looked like there were supposed to be bath robes, but there were none. No big deal. Ok, that's the good. Now the bad. We found the hotel staff to be not very accommodating, and most of the time acted as though it was a bother for them to be asked anything. This happened time and time again, from the bell staff to the front desk, concierge, pool and casino staff. Here is one example: the hotel has guest laundry; the change machine was not working. It was close to the pool, so I went to the pool bar to get change. NO! To the front desk. NO! To the casino - yes but not very happily. Four outlets before I could get a dollar's worth of quarters!! Also, everything in PR is extremely expensive. Drinks and food at the pool are ridiculously priced, and here again, the staff very mediocre. Tip: one of the best and cheapest things on the menu are the empanadillas. All in all, we found Puerto Rico to be not a very hospitable place. The past 2 vacations have been spent in Mexico, and the difference is amazing. In MX, we were made to feel like people were genuinely happy to see us, the prices were always reasonable, and food always good. My advice: skip PR altogether and go to Rivera Maya.

This is also a big conference hotel, and I would say not a particularly romantic getaway, but overall very nice. I thought they did a great job renovating the rooms; a bit of an Asian flair instead of your typical caribbean theme, very comfy beds (no wierd smell on our pillows), huge bathroom and about a 3x3x3 foot glass shower with amazing water pressure. The shower \"leak\" was not a leak, per se, but water seeps out between the door hinge. Not a problem..just put a towel down. We had no problems with a/c, or the safe. The only problem we had with the room was that we were in the ocean tower facing the street, on the 9th floor. Construction on the other building did not bother us at all, but the traffic could be heard even with the door closed. In fact, cars driving by were so noisy at 11:30 on Sat. night we had to close our door to go to sleep. I would spring for the ocean view so you can hear the waves instead of the traffic! The concierge's were both VERY helpful, recommended some great restaurants, and got us set up with a rental car just down the street which we took to El Yunque and Bacardi. I definitely recommend renting a car for this rather than doing the tours. Also, wear your swim suit and towel to El Yunque..you can swim in the waterfall! The beach was not as bad as some say..it was pretty empty except for one day when a bus load of small kids came by for about 1/2 hour. We just headed up to the pool, which was very nice. The beach is on the lagoon, so there are no waves to ride, and there is a bridge with a fair amount of traffic right next to the beach. It wasn't that bad, but if you want to walk for miles on a secluded beach, this was not the place. Other than the beach, the location of the hotel was great. Old San Juan was about a 35 minute walk, or there is local bus stop right next to the beach. If you walk down the block there are MANY great local restaurants...our favorite was ROPA VIEJA, a Cuban/Puerto Rican place that was always crowded just a little ways down from the hotel. The Italian restaurant at the hotel was good, and so was the pool restaurant. Personally, I thought the drinks at the pool bar were expensive and did not have very much alcohol in them. Here's a great tip....there is a little convenience store just next to the hotel. We got a jug of Bacardi at the distillery, and stocked up on mixers at the store and made our own drinks!!

Our room had just been completed not long before and our phone was not hooked up yet...when I mentioned this to the front desk they immediately wanted to move us to another room, but since my husband and I had our cell phones we opted not to. And, one of the elevators was out of service for a couple of days. Two more things...if you're looking for a huge beach to people-watch on, this hotel may not be for you. Because Condado is on the Atlantic side of the island, the water is rough and the hotel's beach lies against a lagoon on the west side of the hotel. It's a small beach, but very quaint, and more than roomy enough, I thought. And, there is a 24 hour Subway about 500 feet from the hotel in case you get super late-night munchies. Trust me, that comes in handy.

We stayed April 21-27 and I don't know if we got lucky or what but we didn't have the problems other people had. My sister stayed in a separate room and had the same opinion. Rooms: The remodeled rooms were very nice, the glass shower did not leak at all although we did hear of others who had trouble, the safe did not work but the housekeeping manager who happened to be out in the hall had someone there within 5 minutes to reset it for us. Beds and pillows were comfortable, big towels, hairdryer, refrigerator, private balconies. Construction was going on across the way on the other tower but it was not that bothersome. We were in the ocean tower facing the other tower which was still not bad because you could still see the lagoon, and part of the beach, and the bridge, and all the lights at night. Restaurants: They had four open at the time. Everything at their Italian restaurant was good - breakfast, the desserts, drinks. And we also ate a few times at the pool restaurant and were pleased with both the food and service. Drinks and food, while higher that what you would pay \"at home\", were no more expensive than what you would pay in any other resort. One of the guys at the Starbucks makes the best caramel lattes I've ever had - my sister sister could smell it all the way across the elevator. We did not eat at the Tony Roma's because we can get that at home and spent most of our time looking for local food. Pool/Beach: We never saw more than maybe 20 people at the public beach so it wasn't crowded but we preferred the pool area as our son went up and down the waterslide literally for hours on end, plus there's the convenience of having food and drink right there if you're planning on spending the whole day at the pool. General: We never had any issues with the elevators as others have mentioned. All of the employees were very friendly and helpful.

We did not book an Ocean View room but got upgraded on check in. (Tip: Sweet talk goes a long way when checking in.) This made our stay here fantastic but I think we would have been very disappointed if we did not get ocean view. The hotel has 2 separate towers and they have been under a long remodeling period. One tower is right on the ocean and the rooms are completely remodeled. This is where we stayed. I stay in a lot of hotel rooms and this room was great. Very private balcony over the ocean, great beds, great AC, modern bathroom with romantic shower, & large flat screen TV. CAUTION: The problem with this tower is if you don't get ocean view and are on the other side you are looking at the 7 day per week construction of the other tower. The tower under construction is directly across the street and that is why I say we would have been very disappointed if we did not get Ocean View. Even when the other tower is 100% done I would not want to look at other peoples balcony's for the money charged at this hotel. Now the other side of that tower over looks the bay with the city behind it. That would be my second choice. It also looked like the top floors of the construction tower were done so staying there might have some unwanted noise. HOTEL STAFF: Before going to PR many others told us most wait staff was not helpful or friendly. We found the complete opposite to be true. All the hotel staff were great and we met friendly staff where ever we went in the hotel. HOTEL POOL: The pool area was great with both salt water and fresh water pools but the 105 degree hot tub was too much for most people. Many complained and each time and staff said they were going to look into it but 4 days later the hot tub was still 105. Drinks in the hotel and by the pool are very, very expensive. Many people had sticker shock after the first round. Every drink has 15% added on also. Next door to the hotel is a small store that sells beer, wine, liquor and a little of everything else at good prices. Even the bartender told us to stock up next door and use plastic cups by the pool. After the first day we never bought a drink in the hotel. HOTEL FOOD: Again very, very expensive but many other places are in the area. A couple of doors down from the hotel is a great Mexican restaurant that offers breakfast and lunch specials that are very cheap and great food. Also there is a 24 hour Subway close by for when you come back to the hotel at 2am and you are starving. Also MIRO is a few blocks from the hotel and food is 5 star seafood. Do not miss MIRO while staying here. OTHER: Cabs run 24 hours per day and the prices are all pre-set to most places. Old San Juan is about 5 miles away and we loved it. Very safe after you get to know it. My wife shopped all day by herself while I worked. Oh and local police are everywhere all the time. Every couple of blocks are more police. Always felt safe. Old San Juan has some great places to eat. Some expensive and some not. Don't expect the speed of service you would in a large US city but much more friendly. Bathrooms are not very good in most places by not a problem for my wife and I. We love the local culture. Dinning in OSJ is not like dining in Manhattan, NY. Don't expect it and you won't complain. If you expect it, don't go. Take your time and enjoy the night. Hotel had large casino but we did not go into it. We don't gamble. Next to the hotel is Charlie's Car rental. Only one who had cars available and the hotel will arrange for you. Very good cars at cheap rates and you can drop off by the airport if you want. Rent a car for the day and head out to the rain forest. PR has a bad rush hour in the morning and also evening so head out early if it's a weekday. There is no real beach by this hotel. It is very small and crowded on the weekend but if you walk a couple of blocks down there is a longer beach by the other hotels. There are also 2 other large beaches within a cab ride.

Also, we took a nonstop flight from Boston and we were basking in the sun in no time at all. First, always do your research before you choose a hotel.

I researched a couple of restaurants and checked with the professional and helpful concierge, Jean Pierre who would either agree or suggest another choice that my daughter might prefer.

We had a long day of travel and decided to call it a night and meet up with the concierge the next day. We headed across the bridge to our room. We were met with construction. It was ok though; everything was blocked off as it should be and looked relatively safe. We got to our room, it was what we expected, a room in major need of renovation, but it was clean and seemed well put together. That night, we were awoken several times to things dropping outside the hotel. At 2am I went out on our balcony only to find construction workers dropping heavy items down to the first floor to load in dumpsters. The noise continued for most of the night. So much for only doing construction between 9am and 6pm! We spoke with a lady at the front desk the next morning who told us to check in around 6pm and she would move us to the newly renovated tower; for the same government rate! We were thrilled and surprised. A lot of the reviews state how rude and not helpful the staff are; we were pleasantly surprised! The newly renovated room was outstanding. They really have done a nice remodel to the new rooms. Areas of concern: The concierge desk needs major help. We wanted to book the biolumiscent bay trip and nobody could tell us how/when to do it. We were told that there probably weren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t enough people going so we couldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t go.

I guess that is why they are at the Hilton, over the top nice and they were able to book our tour for us.

We also rented a car and had no trouble in the self-park lot underneath the hotel. Parking was $15/night which we thought was pretty reasonable. I did, however, have some concerns: - the hotel restaurants were horrible (the poolside restaurant was decent) and do not reflect the upscale feel of the hotel generally; you would do better to eat at one of the fabulous restaurants in Condado (all walkable), Old San Juan or at the nearby Caribe Hilton - the concierge desk could use some work; it would be helpful if the concierge had menus for the area restaurants available and had printed directions to some of the popular tourist spots like El Yunque, Bacardi Factory, etc. - the smoking; I can understand why smoking would be allowable in the casino and in the lounge, but at the pool, at the swim-up bar, in the lobby, etc. Not only is it nasty but again, it does not match the upscale feel that the hotel is trying to create Overall, though, I would still recommend Condado Plaza.

I can't say for sure, but I think the sheets and pillowcases were changed at least once during our stay (maybe more). They were spotless. The pool area is attractive, spacious and well layed out. Unfortunately, the first three days landscape workers were trimming the bushes and trees and then grinding them in a truck nearby the pool area. Kudos to the front desk staff, especially those working the Concierge Desk. They responded to our pesky daily inquiries with professionalism and good humor. I have to say though that the hotel union workers demonstration at 6:00 a.m. was scary being woken out of a dead sleep. We don't speak Spanish, and had no idea what was going on in front of the hotel with police sirens and some guy going on and on with a loud bullhorn. We nicely complained to management, but we weren't as lucky as the previous poster...all we got was two complimentary breakfasts for two days = $28.00.

The Condado Plaza used to be part of the Wyndham chain of hotels but is now part of Luxury Resorts and Hotels. Ongoing renovations definitely detract from the luxury hotel aspirations the hotel has as the sounds of construction can be heard from 8:30 a.m. until 5 p.m., especially on the Lagoon side where our room was located. Also, there was no running water from 9:30 a.m. until 3:30 p.m. every day. As my husband was in San Juan as a government contractor staying at government rate, we got one of the City view rooms which are the more traditional rooms pictured on the internet. But, other than the daytime lack of water and construction noise, we had no complaints. The room was very large with a comfortable King sized bed, a sleep sofa, TV and VCR, keyed safe, small refrigerator, mini-bar, table and chairs, large Jacuzzi tub (the jets no longer work), ironing board and iron, balcony with table and chairs, coffee maker, and high-end toiletry articles. If you use the link to determine the hotel location you will be misled\u00e2\u20ac\u201d999 Ashford Ave. is 2 or 3 blocks east toward the airport. The Condado Plaza is located just before Ashford Ave. crosses the Condado lagoon near its opening to the sea, next to a small public beach. The beach allows you to swim, even snorkel somewhere other than a pool as there is no beach on the ocean directly behind the hotel. In fact, this may be the only place in the immediate San Juan area where you can snorkel and see a few fish--nothing great but better than nothing. There are 3 pools to choose from, a lap pool behind the Laguna side, and on the ocean side a salt water pool and a pool with swim-up bar, volleyball net, and water slide. Hot tubs are located in both pool locations and also inside the fitness centers. Towels are available at both locations and also snorkeling gear at the main pool (don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t know if there is a charge as we had our own) and wristbands are used. The fitness center on the Laguna side has been updated and includes stationary bikes (recumbent and regular), stair stepper, elliptical machine, treadmills, and various weight machines and free weights. In addition to the hot tub, there is a steam room and direct access to the outdoor pool. Behind the pool are 2 tennis courts and a dock on the Condado Lagoon. I did not see the Ocean side fitness center but it is probably even nicer. A resort fee of 14% is charged to your bill to cover these amenities. As is usual in San Juan, there is a large Casino, probably open 24 hours a day. Many of the hotel restaurants have not opened for business as the renovations are not complete. I believe that the very mixed reviews for this hotel are a result of the ongoing renovations. The rooms that have been finished look really nice. But the Laguna side of the property is a construction site during the day which definitely detracts from the luxury hotel image the Condado Plaza is trying to cultivate. Probably as a result of the ongoing construction, prices are lower than other hotels right now so the hotel is a good value. It is in a wonderful location, fairly close to Old San Juan, but also plenty of restaurants nearby.

We had an ocean view room and the room was recently renovated and clean. The bed however, was very uncomfortable leaving us with many restless nights as well as overall soreness each morning.

The first day we had 2 turkey wraps, shared an order of fries one frozen drink and a beer and total with tip came to $66 dollars. The other restaurants in the hotel were closed with the exception of the italian restaurant where the service was much to be desired. There are many restaurants within walking distance that are good and much much cheaper. If you are looking for a nice moderately priced place for dinner you must try Ropa Veija right down the street, The food and service were superb and by far the best meals we had on the island. The location of this hotel is great only 10-15minutes from Old San Juan. TIP: take the bus the bus stop is right outside of the hotel and its only 75cents each way versus 12 each way for a taxi.

David was super polite and helpful, and our room was ready. We were given yummy cracker/cookies with guava flavoring (a nice touch!) and headed to our room on the 8th floor. We stayed in room number 818 and had an EXTRAORDINARY ocean-front room. We were right on the water and absolutely loved the room. We had a remodeled two-bed room and found everything in working order (we used the safe with no problems, the telephone worked just fine, and made tea and coffee each morning). Our room was comfortable, clean and stylish. We ate at the Italian restaurant our first night and had a beautiful table right by the window and enjoyed the sunset. Our waiter was so attentive and good to us; we felt spoiled! The food was okay..... My husband's chicken dish was better than my lasagna. The wine was very reasonably priced. It was a nice way to start our weekend! We had some cocktails at the casino lounge, and the drinks were a bit pricey. However, you are at a resort property, and it wasn't more expensive than anything in New York or a high-end bar in Las Vegas. We didn't have good luck at the casino, but had a nice time anyway! There is a little gift shop on the first floor that sells all kinds of stuff.... We wanted to have a few beers and spent $5 for each bottle (we joked about the $30 six-pack!). The woman at the register told us they are not part of the hotel, so they charge pretty high rates for beverages. The next day we discovered some local convenience stores with much more affordable prices! Our room was cleaned each day after we left, and everyone we encountered at the property was polite. We were very well taken care of! We walked through Condado (take a left after you exit the front doors) and sat in a lovely park one afternoon. Old San Juan is a lot of fun and we enjoyed the little restaurants.

I was there visiting a friend who was on business travel. I would definitely suggest this hotel to friends and colleagues that plan on visiting San Juan. The rooms were beautiful and housekeeping did a great job of maintaining the cleanliness during the week that I was there. The pool area was also beautiful and well maintained. The location is also great, it is very close to Old San Juan, within a short taxi ride or 45 minute walk. It is also very close to many great local restaurants. I would go running every morning and the area both around Condado and the surrounding neighborhoods are very clean and well kept and everything is beauiful. Visiting from Minnesota during the winter, the weather was more than amazing! I understand and saw that they are undergoing many renovations, but it is easy to see that it will be an even better place to stay when they are finished with construction. They did a fairly good job of keeping a lot of the construction out of immediate viewing and also well marked. Condado Plaza Hotel is not the only place undergoing renovations in Puerto Rico, there is construction everywhere, as it is a growing area and San Juan, Puerto Rico, as a city, is constantly undergoing construction/renovations. One suggestion that I would make is to the travel desk/excursion information/area. I did take a morning tour to El Yunque rainforest and was not very impressed with the travel guide or the quality of the tour. I am not sure if the hotel has a contract with certain guides, but the tour of the actual rainforest was very quick, with a long stop at one of the little souvenir/snack places on the way back, where the majority of the time was spent. I thought there would be more hiking and viewing of the rainforest, so I was disappointed. A suggestion would be to have an anonymous evaluation after the tours to help enhance this area. I was not sure the main difference between the travel desk and the concierge desk, but another suggestion would be to have a more focused travel and excursion desk, as the majority of guests at the hotel are tourists and tourists look for readily available information. Customer service was also pretty good, you could tell that they were a little understaffed and busy during the time I was there, but everyone was very friendly and willing to help. Again, overall, the hotel was great, San Juan is a fabulous and fun city and there is a lot to do within San Juan and the surrounding areas.

The \"beach\" at the hotel is hardly a beach... but only a 10 minute walk down the street is a nice beach to lay out and swim at. Our first room was ocean front on a high floor with a great view. Unfortunately (after a night of being out dancing and drinking) we were woke up bright and early to hammering and construction. It was impossible to tell where it was coming from. After about a half hour of this noise we called the front desk. They said they would look into it... 15 minutes later there was no response. A second call still received no response to the problem. Finally after walking down to the front desk we were offered a non ocean front room to spend the rest of the morning in. Since (upon asking) we were told that this construction would go on every morning, we told them a new ocean front room would be needed. The new room was supposed to be ready at one at which point we were told 2... finally around 4:00 after still not being ready and losing our patience with the problem, a room became available. It is wonderful that they are doing (much needed) renovations to the property. It was felt that they knew the construction would be going on and gave us the room hoping we would be up bright and early and not notice... Since this was a chance they took (at our expense) they should have been more responsive instead of giving us the feeling they were brushing us off.

We did eat once in the hotel and the food does suck-there are so many restaurants down the street and in old san juan that are much better and not at all inconvienent to get to. The pools at the Condado are wonderful and the grounds are breathtaking. The pool bar actually makes the best frozen drinks that I had In San Juan. They have a great fitnes room if you like to workout and a really nice steam and sauna room which is usually very private. The concierge was always helpful with answering our questions about buses, restaurants, and activities. Vacation is what you make of it-if you want to complain then you will surely find things about the Condado Hotel to complain about, but if you relax and enjoy what is offered I'm sure you will be pleased. If there is a problem just ask them nicely to fix it-i'm sure they will try to accomodate you!

I would not choose it as my vacation spot if I was going to San Juan. The hotel is pricey because it's a \"resort\" with a casino (there is a resort tax in addition to local tax) and the area is definitely for business travelers and tourists. The room was fine (bedroom area with a living room area) -- view not good but that's only because the conference attendees did not get ocean-front. No beach really -- unless you like the beach created next to the lagoon. Pools are nice but they can be noisy with all the children playing during the day. However, you can relax in areas away from the pool. Interior hallways of hotel look old and they are in the process of doing some renovating. Not a fancy casino -- just a small one made mostly of slot machines. Note: The hotel has two buildings. One directly on the ocean and another across the street. If you get in the one across the street, ask for a room that overlooks the lagoon/bay. Otherwise, you are looking at the back of the building that is on the ocean front. If you take taxis, get a rate from the driver and doorman at hotel before getting in to ensure you get the \"right\" rate.

Bathroom needed cleaning when I checked in & it was taken care of promptly. The pool area is nice, but also showing signs of wear, as is the yard area. Don't stay here for the beach, it is very small, but it is a beach. However considering the price paid; the Condado Plaza is fine. My room was furnished nicely. (Actual furniture is showing wear) However, good TV & movie selection, refrigerator, safe, balcony, coffee maker & internet access in-room for a fee. There is a bus stop & public information area nearby the pool area. (Only .75 vs. $12 cab ride to town) No public internet when business center is closed on weekends. There are convenience stores, a Subway, Chilis, & several nice restaurants all within walking distance. Ate dinner @ the Italian restaurant in the hotel, service, food & price were good! (Unless you are looking for Subway's three for $10). Coffee shop in front of hotel. Casino was typical of Casino's, crowded, smokey, & noisey. Concierge was not very helpful on any shift. I think they were into the \"big bucks\"; not in helping me find a bus schedule. I visited many hotels in the Condado area, ALL are in need of updating, as is the whole Condado area. The Marriott seemed to be in the best shape w/ a Great bar, nice store, pastry shop w/public internet access, all in the Lobby area. There was entertainment, dancing & a nice casino area. I think I would stay in one of the more remote areas of PR on my next trip. The downside of renovations: A construction lift was assembled right outside my balcony & ran from 8 AM until 7 PM. The day before I checked out, they slipped letters under doors offering to relocate anyone who was inconvenienced. However It was a little late for me. When checking out I very politely asked for a manager (s) & showed them video of the view & noise. They were very apologetic & asked if they could remove my \"room charges\" (dinners, movies, etc) since I had prepaid. I was more than happy with the arrangement.

We chose the Condado Plaza because the rest of the hotels closer to the airport had negative reviews about the noise level of the planes flying throughout the day. The hotel occupies two buildings on either side of Ashford Avenue, which are connected by a walk-way from the casino. The main building (the one with the lobby) is towards the ocean and the building opposite is towards the lagoon. I asked to be shown two rooms and got to see the City Vista rooms in both buildings. The room in the main building was definitely run-down, with very old carpeting and worn out furniture. I prayed that the second room would be better and it was! I can only surmise that the people who wrote unhappy reviews got to stay in the City Vista rooms in tne main building. FYI, all City Vista rooms face the opposite buliding and from some, you can get a glimpse of the sea. Like some reviews mentioned, the concierges are not very helpful and are standoffish, but not rude. One gave me false information once - I had asked how much a taxi cost to go to Old San Juan and he said I did not need a taxi and could just walk the distance as it was right around the corner and about a 5-10 minute walk. It was lucky I asked the bellman for specific directions, because it turned out that it was a 5-10 minute RIDE in the taxi! The Condado beach is a public one and can be accessed by walking through the hotel, past the pools, or by the road. There is a person there to help you with the chairs. If you are a guest of the hotel, you do not need to pay the $4.00 to rent chairs. There are locals, at the beach, but for me, that was a great part of the charm. Puerto Ricans like to vacation with their families and it was wonderful to hear a new language, even if I did not understand it!. The beach is small and you cannot walk anywhere as there are rocks that form a barrier. On the bright side this is exactly what makes it safe for children to swim in those waters and there are fish that fish that my daughter chased around. Because of the rocks, the sand is not fine and you can get a scratch or two if not careful. It didn't bother me and we all went barefoot. The pools were on the smaller side and it was difficult to get chairs around the pool if you got there late. But the water-slide was great fun and the size of the pool was not an issue for me. The baby-pool is more like a fountain, but I was happy to have my little one wading in it, while watching my elder one at the water-slide. Old San Juan is to the right of the hotel. To the left of the hotel a nice walk, with some interesting shops, restaurants and convenient stores. A mile or so down to the left, is a nice, lively area with lots of people and restaurants. That is where the Radisson and the Marriott are located. Eating out is very expensive. We tried to find cheaper places to eat in, but the price in most places are fairly comparable. Since there is no sales tax on the island (good thing if you want to buy something from the Cartier, Dior close by), I suspect, restaurants make up for it. We were thankful to have Subway round the corner from the hotel and stocked up on snacks, orange juice and milk. Maid service was regular and a couple of requests we had were met promptly. When we interrupted the service however (we came for a quick change, when the maid was cleaning the room) it never got finished. Check-in and check-out were fast and efficient. Sure the Ritz is better, but I would have spent $350 a night there, as opposed to $150 a night at the Condado plaza. I would definitely stay at the Condado Plaza again, if we were to come back to the San-Juan area of P.R. It's proximity to Old San Juan (a $12 taxi-ride each way), but removed from the hustle bustle of the same, is very attractive. We went there every evening to eat and even tried this place called La Bombonera (unadvertised by tourist guides) which is a great little place with inexpensive and ethnic food; it also had some great pastries. There is a bus-stop to the left of the hotel, a minute's walk, where you can take a bus to the old city for a mere 75 cents and save yourself a nice bundle if you had the time. I took it twice and the bus drops you off at the pier in Old San Juan. Puerto Rico is a lovely place and we will definitely be back to the island again.

We booked a room through the hotel's website (which ironically, still states that it's associated with the Wyndham chain) and were able to get a city view room at the rate of $195 per night with the AAA discount. Upon arrival, however, we inquired about the availability of ocean view rooms and were given a free upgrade to a room with a nice balcony on the 8th floor. No hassling required! I definitely recommend asking upon check-in....worst case scenario is that they say no and you're stuck with a view of the lagoon. Though I must say that it is quite nice to sip your morning coffee on the balcony while watching and listening to the waves crash on the rocks. Overall, the room was average. We were 3 girls in the room with plenty of luggage in tow, so the enormous walk-in closet came in extremely handy. There was also a bar with not one, but two fridges in it, which we used to store a couple of bottles of wine that we bought from the convenience store next door. The bathroom was also average, though our tub did have the tendency to clog. We called housekeeping on the second day and they immediately sent up a repair man who fixed the problem. Service was below average. Although housekeeping was very pleasant and responed immediately to extra towel, extra pillow, and extra hair-dryer requests, the other other hotel staff was not very helpful nor very friendly. The concierge staff was quite rude, and though they did make a few dinner reservations in Old San Juan for us, they did so somewhat reluctantly. The young lady at the tour desk was extremely haughty and relatively uninformed regarding the various trips they had to offer. In addition, the staff in the various restaurants spoke limited English and were not very attentive. The pool and beach area were also below average. There were plenty of chairs and a nice poolside bar, though the pools themselves were extremely small and had a lot of debris in them. We walked onto the \"beach\" one day to check it out and immediately walked off. Although the water was warm and seemed clear, the sand was kind of dirty and had a lot of locals on it. Definitely no privacy or sense of calm. Of note, access to the hotel from this public beach is guarded by hotel security, who require that you show either your room key or the wrist band that they give out at the towel stand. Security also patrolled the pool area regularly and promptly removed people who were not patrons of the hotel. The food at the pool bar is extremely expensive! A salad there is $18...the same exact salad at the Italian restaurant on the Mezzanine level is $4.95. Definitely worth the short trip upstairs. We spent most of our pool/beach days at the Caribe Hilton which is right across the lagoon and is accessible via a short walk across the bridge. Our friend gave us his Hilton Honors card, so we were able to walk right into the hotel, get towels, use the facilities, etc. The pool and beach area is 100 times nicer at the Caribe Hilton than at the Condado Plaza, but at a rate of $400 a night, I think our strategy was better! The Caribe Hilton also has a very nice spa (1 hour massages in the $120-150 range) and a beautiful Pan Asian restaurant called the Lemongrass Grill. Definitely on the expensive side ($25-30 per entree), but the food and the ambiance seemed well worth it (I personally don't know how much our bill came to since our friend knows the owner, who came over and sat with us for the majority of the meal and then waived the bill!!!) The Caribe Hilton also has a Starbucks in its lobby, which we visited quite frequently! In terms of other restaurants in the Condado area, there is a nice Cuban/Puerto Rican restaurant called Ropa Vieja that's about a 3 minute walk from the Hotel. Very large portions and very reasonably priced (Our bill with appetizers and wine came to about $65 in total). I also recommend checking out Calle Fortaleza in Old San Juan which has a ton of really good restaurants. Lastly, the gym at the hotel was pretty nice...4 treadmills, 4 stationary bikes, and a whole slew of weight machines and free weights. There's a sign on the door that says a $7 fee will be automatically charged to your account once you swipe your hotel room key to get in, but no such charges showed up on our bill upon check-out. There is, however, a standard $48 per night resort fee/resort tax that is automatically charged to your account, so beware that you actually need to add on about $50 to the rate they initially quote you. Overall, the hotel superceded my expectations, though after staying at the Ritz Carlton on a previous trip to Puerto Rico and seeing the Caribe Hilton, I doubt I'd go back.

Given all of the seasonal weather that the Caribbean experiences, I did not expect Ritz Carlton service nor amenities. Upon my arrival on 4/3, my reservation was lost in the system. So I had to wait for an hour to get checked in. I was apologized to and upgraded to an ocean view from city view. The hotel was not full so, it would have been unoccupied anyway. However, I am thankful. The rooms are a bit out of date and reminded me of the Holiday Inns we stayed at many years ago as kids. The decor was modern. The bathroom was slightly larger than 3 lavatories on an aircraft. If I leaned too far I would probably fall out of the shower and onto the toilet or floor. It would be nice at renovation if they gave less room to the huge walk in closet and more bathroom space. The staff was quite pleasant. Our first night/into day 2 resulted in a mix up with housekeeping. We didn't have our room serviced since they waited so long to clean our room. They brought up towels and promptly took care of us the next day. We did have low pressure to our sink faucet, but they immediately made necessary repairs. Beach is not great but will do. Lots of debris and coarse sand. The pool is okay, yet a good cleaning or fresh paint from staining would be nice. The hot tub was fab. The kids loved the slide. The one thing that I did miss was the hotel in room guide on what the hotel itself had to offer. I am assuming since their ownership is changing they've removed the marketing material. Also the cable went in and out and often switched to channel 02 all by itself. That was aggravating. And Channel 33 (the hotel channel) had digital pixels which required you mentally putting the picture together. We ate breakfast one morning at Max's. Horrible. Kids ate free, but after leaving Vegas with the $10.95 buffet and paying $21.00 per person for this was bad. Bad eggs. Omelette chef needs some major help. Churrascos a little tough. Our waiter Rafael was great. Go out of the hotel and walk across the street to the Sizzler for lunch. They've got an all you can eat buffet. Get there about 1030A, cause the locals really show up for lunch. Also walk around the Condado area (go left leaving the hotel). It is a nice after dinner walk. Besides we discoverd Subway, Baskin Robbins/Dunkin Donuts, Wendys, Walgreens, Banco Popular (ATM machine on site). Also upscale shopping at Christian Dior, Cartier, Louis Vuitton, and Salvatore Ferragamo. Also the B21 bus takes you to Plaza las Americas (the mall). It was raining the day we went to Sizzler and the guy charged us $10 to go across the street. WALK! What a waste. He made me use my known Spanish. We had paid $12 to go to Old San Juan the day before. Oh while in OSJ, make sure you eat at Cafe Puerto Rico and order mofongos de mariscos (seafood).

We knew not to expect the Ritz, but were so disgusted by this hotel that we did not even spend the night here. To begin with, the hotel does not have \"white sand beaches,\" despite that exact description on the website. There is a \"lagoon,\" which is a dirty, miniscule sliver of land which also contains a children's swingset. You cannot swim in the ocean from this hotel. We were expecting a beach hotel and were shocked to find that there was no beach. Second of all, when we arrived at the hotel at approximately 5 pm, the only place we could find to eat was at Tony Romas, which is across the street. The staff was rude and completely dismissive. When I asked about the reported 7 restaurants that the hotel advertises, the nasty staff member looked at me as if I were insane and then said that each of the restaurants I asked about \"was not there.\" When I pointed to the sign that advertized these restaurants, the staff just shrugged. This was not a language barrier issue, as I asked in both English and Spanish. Though there were no other customer's at the concierge's desk, the concierge did not acknowledge me (despite the fact that we made eye contact) until I actually shouted \"excuse me\" several times. When I asked about the beach, the concierge rudely directed me to the internet kiosk. When I pressed him further, he said that the Marriott had a beach and suggested that it was a 5-10 minute walk away. As I promptly switched to the Marriott, I can assure you that it was a 5-10 minute taxi drive--not within walking distance unless you felt like taking a hike. Lastly, the room was disgusting. Though it was a non-smoking room, there were cigarette burns on the furniture, the furniture was cracked, old and dirty and the room itself was small. The bathroom was miniscule. Though the dirty hotel directory (and yes, I do mean dirty--there were recent food stains on the pages) stated that there was a mini-bar, when I asked the desk about the lack of a mini-bar, they told me that they had discontinued mini-bar service. The hotel itself was seedy and run-down. To put it simply, we did not feel safe there. My friend and I realized quickly that we did wish to stay at the hotel and began frantically calling local hotels to find somewhere else to stay. Though we only made LOCAL calls from the room, apparently local to the hotel means in-hotel only (despite what it said on the phone). Calls to the nearby Marriott (ie: within the same area and local calling code) wound up costing $50, though it was a small price to pay to get out of that dump. Do not stay here!

Check in was a breeze - 5 minutes and they had our room ready at noon (we expected to have to wait till 4) The room was very clean, we had a beautiful ocean view on the top floor. The maid was great - came every night and replaced the towels we used to shower with before dinner. Then came back later on to see if we needed anything else. The hotel is on the older side, the room was a little dated. But it was very clean. We loved the huge walk in closet - it kept our clothes out of the way and gave us a place other than the bathroom to change (we had kids with us) Our major disappointment was the beach. We are beach people and one of the reasons I booked this place was for the beach. The photos on all the websites do it much more justice than it deserves - the beach is right on the highway - loud trucks and cars racing by, not the serene beach experience we were looking for. Also - it's a lagoon - not the ocean. It is very rocky - filled with sharp rocks that slice your feet and hands...wear water shoes. Also it is a public beach, not just for hotel guests. We mostly stayed by the pools which were clean. My son loved the water slide and towels were readily available. As with most resorts, you have to come claim your seats early in the morning to get the best location. We ate breakfast in the hotel - Max's restaurant - for $15 you got a nice buffet - all you can eat. homemade waffles and omelets....very good. We didn't try the other restaurants but ventured down the street and into old san juan and had some great meals. We did have lunch one day at the pool restaurant which was horrible and over priced. The hotel staff was weak. They really didn't seem to care, unlike other places we've been where the staff is very attentive (and looking for tips) the staff here seemed like they couldn't be bothered. The swim up bar at the pool had one, sometimes two bartenders - you had to wait forever to be served (weak $8 drinks or a $3 soda that was about 3 oz soda and 5 oz ice)....there were always lines at the bar -- no waiters walking around while you were at your lounge chairs taking drink orders. The restaurant at the pool had HORRIBLE service - one afternoon I ordered lunch, waited one hour and was told my order was never put in, because they were busy. It was Presidents week and I'm sure the hotel was full - but ADD MORE STAFF!!! We're not big lunch eaters so after a big breakfast, all we really needed was a snack mid-day and then dinner....After dinner one night we got a case of soda (you could also get beer) from a local store and put it in our room refrigerator.

Right next door, there is Waikiki Restaurant & Bar that is a bit more expensive but steaks there are great. Both restaurants offer magnificent oceanview. On the other hand, staff of Condado Plaza did not look very knowledgeable about their own hotel. For example, one of the staff didn't even know where the third pool is. Also, do not leave your chairs unattended for too long. We left towels once to reserve spot and went for lunch. When we came back after an hour, the towels were gone. Hotel beach was clean and nice.

Since I think these reviews should start out with a short bio on the author, my wife and I are in our mid-50s, very middle class.

The Condado Plaza seemed to be the best value, so we booked it, even though some of the reviewers have been brutal to this hotel. We booked a city view room and were pleased to find that all the city view rooms have a nice view of the ocean/lagoon/Old San Juan from the balcony. It wasn't as great as the ocean view, but we saved about $50 a day by booking the city view room. Facilities: The restaurants seemed to be nice, but the only one we ate in was Tony Roma's. If you like Tony Roma's in other locations (and we do), you'll like this one just fine. We generally just have one meal a day, and we discovered a half dozen very nice restaurants less than a quarter mile walk down Ashford Avenue. The two pools next to the beach at the hotel are beautiful, and one has a swim-up bar. There is a large hot tub in the pool area. The beach area is modest in size, but it's the calmest point in the Condado area. Note, if you're staying on the Condado at any place other than the Condado Plaza, you'll just be able to watch the ocean, not swim in it. If a great beach is what you are looking for, then stay in one of the hotels in the Isla Verde area. The beach there will satisfy anyone, but you'll be paying a lot more to stay out there. Casino...we went to several in San Juan, and the one at the Condado Plaza was the busiest. They have a Texas Hold-em Table going from about 6PM until the game breaks up, usually about 3AM. Just believe me when I tell you that you can make enough money here to pay for your trip if you are a skilled player. Overall, the casino was extremely satisfactory, with a good live band playing adjacent to it. In general, you must understand that the Condado Plaza is about 40 years old, built just after Castro took over in Cuba in order to fill the need for a classy Caribbean resort. The overall facility is excellent, just dated. The electric and plumbing worked just fine. The room was ample, the furniture was nice. The bathroom was modest, as in all the older hotels, but the closet was the best one I've ever had in all my travels. There is a safe in the room, and our unit had two small refrigerators. I found the poor reviews of this hotel to be either ridiculous, or from people who stayed at the wrong hotel in the first place. If you have a large budget, plan to spend the entire trip in your hotel, want the newest facility and the most dazzling beach, then book the InterContinental, the El San Juan, or the Ritz-Carlton.

The hotel check-in clerk initially told me \"you don't have a deluxe room\". When I showed her the confirmation print-out showing my reservation to be a \"deluxe room\" the clerk said nothing further. In fact, I found the clerk's attitude to be quite curt.

It was a wonderful stay. The staff was very attentive and helpful. The rooms were ample and had a huge closet, which could fit a twin size bed if needed. We were on the 7th floor ocean side. The building by the lagoon had ceiling fans, our side did not. This was not needed since the air conditioning was very good. At night I would make the room very cold and then prop the balcony door opened so that we could listen to the ocean throughout the night. It was a great way to sleep. We had a hard time trying to find a car rental from the places nearby, so the concierge immedialtely called a dealership that would rent cars. We got a better deal then what Avis and L&M were offering. L&M require that you show proof of car insurance if you choose not to take their ins. Of course we did not have our cards with us. Besides their rates were outrageous. The staff were always helpful when it came to giving us directions. They were always ready to open the doors and take luggage. The building is old, so expect some things to be a little runned down. Many people have complained about that the carpeting is old. If People are concerned about carpeting then go somewhere else. This should be the least of your concerns while on vacation. So what if the carpeting is old. You go on vacation to enjoy the sights, the pool and to eat. Not to look at carpeting! The elevators at times were slow, so don't try taking the elevator during checkout time, that is when they are slow, but otherwise they were fine. The pool area was very nice. People complain about too many kids in the pool, but what can you expect, the pool is 3.8ft deep, of course all the small kids are going to be there. It seems to me that these people just don't understand that families go on vacation too, so there are going to be kids. If they they do not want to see so many kids then go to an adult only resort. Leave the rest for those of us who have children. We got to swim in the pool at anytime. Sometimes we were out there until 2am. You simply had to bring your own towels. Staying at the hotel was Rosalyn Sanchez (rush hour) and Shannon Elizabeth (american pie). They seemed to enjoy the hotel also. Some people complain that this is not a 4 star hotel. For the price $(140) it was a very nice hotel. If you want 4 Star then you have to be willling to pay $300 or $400 a night. Some people who checked in after the 4th of July got ratges at $90. I don't know about you but I would rather spend my money on other things than to shell out $5000 just for a hotel. If you want 4 star then go the Ritz or Intercontinental. The area is under a lot of construction. You have to realize that the Condado area was built in the 1960's. So yes, the area is looking a little outdated. But they are working on that. They are currently rehabbing two hotels along the strip. These will be beautiful when completed. Don't expect it to look like Las Vegas, this is an old island and they sre suceptible to hurricanes and wear and tear from the ocean. During the 70's this was a very happening place, and when all of the construction is completed it will be like that again. I think it is still very happeing, on Fri and Sat evenings all of Ashford Ave. is filled with people going out to have a good time. Plenty of outdoor Cafes offering music and drinks. It is very lively and beautiful at night. You don't have to stay in the hotel, it is very safe with plenty of police all around. We never ate at the hotel. I knew the food would be expensive. Instead we would go walking down Ashford Ave. There are plenty of places to choose from. If you don't mind paying a lot for Puerto Rican food then go to Ajili Mojili, or Ropa Vieja. Puerto Rican food is not expensive, so we chose not to eat there. Instead we went to Cafe Angel and the Godfather 3. Their prices were much more reasonable and authentic. In Old San Juan go to El Jibarito on Calle Sol. Excellent food and prices. Yerba Buena has a cuban group that plays excellent music on Fridays nights. They give the audience instruments so that they can participate in the music. I loved the music. There is dancing also if you choose to. This is a Cuban rest. I went for the music and the drinking, so I didn't eat there. My sister did and she loved the food.

I stayed for 2 nights at the Marriott for business but moved the Wyndham Condado the last 2 nights because they were cheaper. I was very happy with the deluxe room (same online AAA booking price as a standard room) that I had because it was more than I needed and it was nicer and more spacious then the room that I had at the Marriott. My room had the bedroom as well as living room, and the bathroom was off the short hallway that joined the two other rooms. There was also a TV in each room, separate climate control for the 2 rooms, internet, 3 phones, mini-fridge, safe, minibar, ceiling fan, standard coffee maker, hair dryer, iron/ironing board in room. The room was clean and well furnished with potted plants, and the sofa in the living room was a sofa bed...and I never caught a whiff of cigarette smoke on my floor or in my room. My view was of the Ocean Side building of the hotel across the street, but past that I could also see the ocean and to the left the lagoon. On the flipside, some other people who were on the trip with me also got a room at the Wyndham Condado, but they were in the other wing of the hotel Ocean Side. Their room was a standard and didn't look as nice- ample space but all the furniture just looked older. Their ice machine didn't work and they complained about the parking and how no one offered to help them with their bags right away. This may explain the mixed reviews that this hotel has gotten. Other things about this hotel: -Pool area on the Ocean Side has a swim-up bar, a water slide, several pools (including saltwater one), hot tub, loads of lounge chairs, hammocks, and is literally separated from the beach by 3 steps. The beach area that adjoins it is small but not too crowded even the 4th of July weekend I was there, was relatively clean (Wyndham staff cleans the area abutting the resort), and there is a wave break that stills the water to a gentle lapping...fish swim right up to your feet in the clear water. -Live Latin music on the small stage near the casino every night I was there...you can dance if you want to. -A lively casino atmosphere and plenty of restaurants in the hotel to choose from. -The lobby has an aquarium the length of a wall, huge mosaics of mermaids, and colorful blown glass light fixtures in the lobby and on the Mezzanine level. -Gusto di Italia- food was okay and prices comparable to Olive Garden, but the service was fantastic. The waiters were very attentive and super nice. Skip Coqui Shack by the pool. The food was not worth, even the $6-something for the breakfast buffet- there are so many other better, cheaper options on Ashford. Other recommendations: Take the bus for 25 cents instead of a cab for $12-$14 each way to Old San Juan or Isla verde. Eat at the Parrot Club in Old San Juan (~$23/entree but worth it). Speak Spanish if you can just because it's a great chance to practice and people are so nice, no one will make fun of you. You can always fall back on English since everyone speaks that too. Also expect: Tropical heat/humidity, crazy driving, music everywhere and police cars that always flash their lights (but not their sirens) even when they aren't trying to pull someone over.

I was a bit skeptical from reading all the negative reviews but I must say I was NOT disappointed. Check in was painless although the lobby seemed a bit crowded the entire week we were there.

Our mini bar however was completely empty the whole time but we didn't even mention it because we bought our own goodies at the Walgreens so we did not sweat that \"small stuff\". We absolutely LOVED the pools. My kids (12 and 3) both had a blast there. The beach is tiny but during the week was not crowded and it was fine. The restaurants however are extremely expensive....$10.00 for a hamburger....ridiculous..okay so you get fries with it....still too expensive. I wasn't thrilled about the local restaurants nearby either. I was looking for more authentic Puerto Rican food which I wasn't impressed by what they consider Authentic....especially Ajili Mojoli.

That's the kind of food we were looking for. One thing I enjoyed almost everywhere I went was the coffee. Even at Subways they had some good old Puerto Rican coffee. The best was the little Mexican place with the $5.75 breakfast. I forgot the name of it but it's right next to Waikiki. You sit overlooking the ocean waves hitting the rocks and enjoy good breakfast and EXCELLENT coffee! Anyway I digress....the Wyndham was a good spot. I called about our TV twice and both times had someone at our door in 10 minutes. At check out, there were some discrepancies with our bill but those were taken care of immediately.

We had an absolute fabulous stay at this hotel. Below are several tips on getting the most for your $$ while on vacation. Upon arrival in San Juan we took a 10 minute taxi ride from the airport to the hotel for $12 total. The hotel is in the tourist zone so the taxis have increasing fees for various zones (this is zone 3 and not bad for the money). I should also note the taxis have a minimum charge of $3/person. When we arrived at the hotel we checked in with our Wyndham By Request # (signup for this program online before your trip as it definitely has its advantages). Although we book our trip through Expedia -in which the program doesn't apply to online bookings (only through travel agents, Wyndham reservations or tour companies) - we were still upgraded to an oceanfront room free of charge and complimentary soda and snacks were placed in our room the next day by housekeeping (part of your preferences w/the program). The room is nice and spacious - parlor, walk-in closet w/safe, bathroom, queen bed w/sofa sleeper and balcony. There's a beautiful view of the ocean. The pools had a steady flow of people during the day; however, the pool bar was always empty. A lot of the guests, as well as my husband, took luxury in relaxing in the lagoon right outside the main pool. The beach advertised in the photos is a very small public beach (all beaches in Puerto Rico are public and access is open to all). During the week it was not very crowded and there's plenty of fish swimming up to you - so feel free to snorkel. The grounds are well manicured and very secure. The hotel restaurants are EXTREMELY, EXTREMELY expensive. However, this is easily remedied by venturing outside the hotel. To the left and about 1 block \u00e2\u20ac\u201c 1 mile away there are several restaurants which you can find good deals (Waikiki, Chilis, Subway, Wendys, Pizza Hut), and for authentic Puerto Rican food (Ropa Vega, Ajoli Mojoli, Caf\u00c3\u00a9 De Angel). We also ate dinner at Tony Romas which wasn't very expensive (spent about $50). There is a Walgreens (near the Marriott) and Liquor Store down this strip to get snacks, pop and water to store in the small in-room refrigerator. The hotel charges $7 for one bottle of beer but you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re better off paying $10.99 for a six pack at the store. The casino is nice and has a steady stream of customers. However, neither my husband nor I are gamblers so we didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t venture much in this realm. Another interesting tip if you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re going into Old San Juan just take Bus 21 and pay .25\u00c2\u00a2 for the 10-15 minute ride. It runs about every 30 minutes and stops right outside the hotel. A good place to eat is Barrachina \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Home of the Pina Colada\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd on Fortaleza St. They'll give you a small sample of their world famous pina colada. As for excursions, the El Yunque tour ($45) is well worth the money as a guide drives you and other couples along the coast east to Fajardo. You\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll see a lot more of the island and learn some good historical information along the way. The Bacardi Rum Tour is overpriced and can be done for much cheaper. Again, take Bus 21 (.25\u00c2\u00a2) to Old San Juan then go to Pier #2 to take the Ferry (.50\u00c2\u00a2) to Cantaneo. Once there pay $3/person for the taxi to the Bacardi distillery which is free to enter plus each person gets two free drink tickets. In total we paid $15 roundtrip for the both of us. While at the plant you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll have to chance to purchase rum and lots of it at a really cheap price (except Bacardi 151 it won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be allowed on the plane).

The restaurant has an excellent view of the ocean with waves crashing in, but there is no beach facing the ocean (rocks). The food in the restaurant was passable, but overpriced (as for most of San Juan), and the service was nothing special. There is a lot of construction as the PR government demolished the old convention center, replaced with a nice park and boardwalk, and is restoring two hotels, including La Concha (should have demolished it & started over). There is a huge new convention center being built across the bay from OSJ on an old military base. I stayed 3 nights at the Condado Plaza for a business trip. 19th floor room was OK and had a nice balcony and an enormous walk in closet. The hotel is on the end of the Condado hotel zone within view of Old San Juan and the fortress. There is a tiny beach area on one end of the hotel overlooking the bridge between Condado and Old San Juan (also under construction), and a decent pool area with fresh and salt water pools. Photo is taken from pool area. There are a number of restaurants and shops in walking distance, and a short cab ride to Old San Juan and the cruise port. I did not use the casino but it was cramped, crowded, smoky and tacky with an obnoxiously loud, bad salsa band. The beaches for most of the hotels on Condado are narrow, and not safe after dark. If you go toward the beach after dark, cops in body armor will shoo you back to the street. Ashford Avenue is safe and heavily patrolled, but the side streets are not recommended at night, and there is a large, dangerous public housing project between Condado and the freeway. If you are looking for beach action, stay in the Isla Verde area or at one of the all-inclusive resorts with private beaches.

From what I could tell, all of the rooms had great balconies which was nice. The hotel has several restaurants (we didn't try any) and a coffee shop. The pool area is really nice - there is a main pool w/swim-up bar, water slide, volleyball, etc and then there's a separate salt-water pool over to the side. The hotel overlooks the ocean and the bay with a small beach area on one side. The bottom is mostly rock & coral so water shoes would be needed - there also were tons of snorkelers. The casino was good size and VERY busy when we were there. They had all games even 2 tables of Texas Hold 'Em. Parking at the hotel was $10/day and the lot is very conveniently located. There's a small convenience store right next door for bottled water, snacks, etc as the gift shop was a little pricey.

We stayed 3 nights at the Wyndham Condado, April 1, 2 and 3, 2005. We'd heard some awful reviews, but our friends had booked the hotel for 1 night and we just decided to extend the stay and remain at the Wyndham Condado. We loved it and Puerto Rico both!......We registered with Wyndham by Request as suggested in advance. Check in took 5 minutes maximum. We had a room over looking the bay across the street. The room was clean and spacious. Nice view of the bay with a small patio. Room had a coffe maker and tea always kept stocked each day. Wyndham by Request left beer, fruit and cheese and water in our room on day 2. My boyfriend is a picky eater....so when he finds a restaurant he likes, it's hard to get him anywhere else....as a result we ate dinner each night in the Italian Restaurant located in the hotel. Food was great (we always had one of the specials, Mahi-mahi or medallions of beef with pasta on the side) and a glass of wine, all very good. Dinner ran about $75 per night for both of us. Breakfast at the hotel is expensive. About $30 for your basic eggs, bacon, toast breakfast. There is an extensive buffet for about $18 per person. The casino is small (of course we go to Las Vegas quite a bit, so there's no comparison), too many nickel slots. Our friend sat at one of the black-jack tables and complained about it taking 45 minutes to get a drink. ....My complaint: Most machines require a hand-pay for any jackpots over $50.00 - $100.00 and on 3 occassions I sat for more than 45 minutes each time waiting to get paid. Things to do: We took a cab to see the forts and explore Old San Juan on foot the first day. Our cab driver took us to Fort (Cristobal?) and we began exploring this fort first, great veiws Old San Juan and the wall extending all the way to the 2nd fort (El Morro?). Beautiful walk along the coast connects the 2 forts with vendors selling things on the stroll from one to the next. So many kids flying kites when you arrive at El Morro - a beautiful sight!.....Then, we had \"Frommers Puerto Rico\" and it contains a map and walking tour of Old San Juan that really helps you to know what the buildings are that you're seeing, (highly recommended). One thing it doesn't mention that you must do, (told to us by our cab driver), when you stop at the Old Church, proceed directly across the street and walk down to the bottom of the hill to see the only remaining gate to the city built by the Spanish. (there were originally 6 gates). Another beautiful spot. 2nd day booked a tour right from the hotel, the Rio Muy Caves and Arecibo Observatory. Caves were amzing. Took about 1 1/2 hours from the hotel by van. You travel in a tram down to the cave entrance (it's massive!) and you go on a walking tour with a guide for a bit over an hour). Not much to see at Arecibo, but it is an amazing sight if you remember the movie \"Contact\" with Jodie Foster - it's there! - There's a room with lots of scientific interactive things to do, but we enjoyed it. Back to the hotel and we enjoyed the salsa music and watched the great dancers right in the hotel that night!....

I wanted a quick getaway for me and my family. I chose the Wyndham Condado for the fact that the online photos of the place and description were very nice. Also for the fact that it had the most affordable rate for the busy week we traveled (Holy WeeK 3/21/05). My first impression was good. After we caught a cab from the taxi stand directly outside the airport we headed straight for the Wyndham which was a 10 minute drive. The hotel was decent and located in a seemingly busy area \"Condado\". There are two different buildings with a clear tunnel connecting the two buildings. The side where we stayed was called the Lagoon and I am not sure what the other building was called. Check in was also decent although our room wasnt quite ready do to the early check in. Lucklly I had family already staying at the hotel at time of check in. I went up to see my other family's room. I have to be honest and say that i was NOT impressed at all. I thought the photos were a bit misleading. The rooms seemed to be old and dingy in appearance such as carpeting and furniture. Maybe it had to do with the building we were in but who knows. The room had a separate sitting area couch, TV, etc. The mini bar was unstocked even though it was mentioned that there is a mini bar in the room which will be replenished daily. There was a little balcony outside with a view of the streets below, a portion of the ocean, and the other building. MY room however was more like a suite i dont understand why because we both paid the same rate. The room was much better than that of my other family's. Much more roomier, and a much bigger balcony WITH a table and two chairs. Even though the building and rooms seemed old, there were good points. The bed was nice, the pillows were great, the bathrooms were clean and the shower is superb. The water pressure or the shower head was almost a massaging type of feeling. Very nice. SOmething you'd have to experience to understand. Our room was cleaned every day with bed made and towels, toiletries replenished daily. I didnt interact with much of the staff there but the staff hailing the cabs and greeting you were very friendly. The pool area is also nice. The view from out there was great. The scenery looked very nice. You can see the water crashing against the rocks right in front of you. This area is to the side of the pool where hammocks and long chairs were set up. The pool is on the other side of the building but you can easily commute through the tunnel. The beach is really nothing to talk about. I believe it is public so anyone can go there. But there is security at the entrace between the \"beach\" and the hotel property to limit entrance by non-hotel guests. Its very small and not very tempting. If you want to enjoy the PR beach then this place isnt recommended. This area is more of the city. I havent seen any reviews on the casino in this place. From first glance it doenst seem very big. but it is a really good size with a lot of machines and tables. When you actually enter and walk around you get the feel of the size. Again, everything seemed old though. The machines were old, the carpeting looked old. But they do pay. We had luck on the slots! I cant comment on the restaurants there. We ate out at the restaurants down the block from the hotel. I wanted Puerto Rican food. You HAVE to sample the local restaurants! Ever had Puerto Rican coffee? There is a Tony Roma's in the lobby of the Lagoon bldg. The service was great. I also noticed a japanese place but there were hardly anyone there. To sum everything up...I had a great time in Puerto Rico, loved the food and was content with the hotel. If you want a fabulous beach resort I wouldnt recommend it here. IF you wanted to come out have fun, enjoy more things outside the hotel and tour then this place should be taken into consideration, although I would have expected a nicer place for the money. Speaking of touring I recommend renting a car for a few nights, get a map and ask the staff for directions. The hotel tour prices were crazy and it only included basically going to and from different locations. I found every where very easily - We did the rainforest (great), Old San Juan (nice), and Belz outlet shopping (also nice). I hope this helps!

The beach is adequate for a quick look, but nothing to write home about (compare it with the Isla Verde pic). I would NOT take the family here. This was a last minute birthday getaway for the wife.

The bathrooms are not designed well at all. Only one person can use it at a time. Now for some helpful hints... Try not to get a city (street) view room. The noise was not bad on Wednesday and Thursday night, but Friday and Saturday night were VERY noisy. Don't be afraid to walk into the town, (NOT OLD SAN JUAN), but the town where these hotels are. The street is Ashford avenue and we walked one evening for about a mile or so past the Marriott and it was VERY nice and SAFE. Lots of restaurants and plenty of police watching out. There is a Walgreens down that way and if you go one of your first days there, buy some bottled water there, only 99 cents compared to $2.00-$3.00 at the hotel. Don't eat at the Italian restaurant at the hotel. Definately venture out and experience the local places, excellent food. If you walk down near the Marriott the restaurants are busy and looked great, from Danny's Pizza to typical Puertorican cuisine. If you want to play tennis, as we did, make sure you play before 10:00AM. We played every morning, with no problem getting a court. There are two courts with lights, we never tried playing late in the day, but the heat in the morning is intense. The main pool area is GREAT, lots of chairs, a separate salt water pool, hammocks and lots of fun. Nothing nicer than sitting at the pool enjoying some food and drinks. Oh and speaking of food at the pool.... There is a Subway less than a block away and SOOOOO many people would go there and get some subs and return to the pool for lunch. The prices for food at the hotel are high. If you want a treat after dinner, the Ice Cream Parlor in the hotel is delicious!! Take a brownie sundae back to the room and enjoy!!", "Date": "March 13, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Norway", "Title": "\u201cLike a paradise\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR3260863", "Content": "we had come from Norway on vaccation, and there they said they had booked us a nice hotell: San Juan Beach hotel, and that we thought was terrible, we were able to get our 4 last days at Wyndham after we did our cruise.

The hotel is located at the tip of a penisula, with the Atlantic ocean forming the northern border of the hotel. We had a lovely room with a balcony and a very comfortable king size bed overlooking the lagoon. This was a southern exposure, so the balcony was engulfed in the sunshine all day.

The hotel was in excellent condition cosmetically, and very clean. The casino was lively with free entertainment along side the Casino. Drinks were priced on the high side, but very well prepared. There was a very reasonably priced Tony Roma's restaurant on the premises, as well as a very good ice cream shop. I am puzzled about the security issues raised in other reviews as the hotel was crowded, people were walking on the streets at night, and the room had its own individual safe.

Upon arrival I was upgraded to an ocean view at no extra charge which turned out to be the only truely positive aspect of my stay. My first visual impression of the property was that of a run-down resort in much need of renovation. Once reaching the room, that impression was solidified. The grounds, indoor and outdoor guest areas were much of the same, especially lacking in simple cleanliness (including the casino, main pool, outdoor bar & restaurant). The salt water pool and hot tub were closed. The small beach resembled the resort in it's lack of upkeep, abundance of trash and to reiterate one other review . . . it is practically part of the adjacent road. One of the evenings I dined in the main restaurant across from the casino, while the meal was not unsatisfactory (with the exception of being seated next to a walled column with more food stuck on it than what was plated), the service was. On another evening I ordered a Chicken Caesar Salad from room service, when it finally did arrive, the chicken had obviously been cooked hours earlier and was unfit to eat. Now to the real infractions, on my third day there Tropical Storm Jean hit. There was absolutely no notification to guests in any manner before, during or after the storm. For myself, a single traveler, any hotel response would have been appreciated and in my opinion necessary, a hotel's guests and their safety should have been the number one priority. The hotel made the mistake of boarding up fire exits which opened up to outside alcoves & enclosed stairways above the pool, unfortunately should there have been a fire at any location down any floor's west corridor, the only safe passage would have been to jump off of a balcony into 75+ mph winds! Oddly enough, the front doors to the resort where open and the hotel staff were allowing visitors to stand outside in the motor lobby while rather large debris blew right in front of them. On the same day, I was told by the restaurant manager that they had run out of food and due to the electricity outage could not cook anything else. I was lucky I'd had some carry on food & water from the plane trip especially as the mini-bar/refrigerator did not work adequately. Please keep in mind I could not leave the property, the hotel was my only source for food and beverage! The housekeeping staff put bags consisting of a bar of soap and a towel on our doors daily during the storm operation. Although no occupied rooms were cleaned, all vacant ones were to accommodate new guests!?! On what would have been my final evening there, I inquired regarding extending my stay as my flight had been canceled, they were quick to accomodate which I do thank them for. Unfortunately, I'd not slept well for the previous two stormy days and the hotel was operating under limited power so the air conditioning in the rooms was not working. The next morning I overheard another guest saying that Old San Juan was back up with full power so I inquired at the front desk if there was another Wyndham I could transfer to and be more comfortable. The young lady verified that the other Wyndham hotel was fully operational and said I was welcome to go to the other property. She also verified there would be no fees for early departure as I was relocating to another Wyndham for the sake of comfort and was leaving on my original departure day. I did so immediately (which happened to be shortly after check out time) and found an absolutely beautiful hotel, (Wyndham Old San Juan), a wonderfully clean and fresh guestroom, and immediately had a four course luncheon that was simply superb! To finish my story, the Wyndham Condado charged me for the last night in which I transferred to the other hotel. I have contacted everyone from the resort's credit manager, my credit card company, as well as Wyndham's Corporate Guest Staff regarding the double billing and have never received any contact. I've traveled back to San Juan since September (I go an average of three times a year) and stayed again at the hotel in Old San Juan I enjoyed that last evening ... ironically it's now an upscale Sheraton!

I read such comments as, \"crowded, smoky lobby,\" \"rude, unhelpful staff,\" \"dirty rooms with mildewed carpet,\" etc. However, after being at the hotel for about 3 hours, my husband and I agreed that this was definitely a nice hotel, and we could not understand why there were so many negative reviews. The hotel is in the process of renovating, and if you go in understanding that, you're already ahead of the game. Our room was beautiful and had a great oceanfront balcony. (We may have stayed in one of the rooms that had already been renovated, but I'm not sure.) In any event, I have no complaints about the room. When I travel, all I really ask is that my hotel room is clean, reasonably nice, and receives daily attention from the housekeeping staff. All of these requirements were met with no problem. I am by no means a \"hotel snob,\" as I have stayed in plenty of budget- and moderately-priced hotels in my lifetime. However, I've also had a 10-day stay on the club level of the Ritz-Carlton San Juan, so my hotel stays have pretty much run the gamut. This hotel is certainly not the R-C, but it's not the complete opposite either. I've stayed in plenty of Wyndhams, and this hotel is on par with the rest of them. It IS an older hotel, but it IS nice, and it IS being renovated. I would stay there again with no hesitation. A couple of negatives, though. First, the beach is probably the smallest public beach I've ever been to. The hotel does indeed front the ocean, but the beach access is on the side of the hotel, and it is Condado Public Beach. It is a tiny beach with no waves. Basically, the beach is at the very beginning of the Condado Lagoon. It's very rocky, so if you want to get out in the water, bring water shoes. A lot of people in our group enjoyed snorkeling, though, because the waters were calmer than the ocean. I prefer waves and a larger beach, so that's why this was a negative for me. Also, drinks and food are unbelievably expensive in the Condado area, including at the hotel. My husband ordered a Medalla Light (local beer) from the hotel's swim-up bar. It came in a 10 oz. can (not 12 oz.) and was $7.00, which we thought was outrageous. If you stay here, just be prepared to shell out the dough if you eat or drink anywhere in the area. I had also read bad reviews about the pool area. Personally, I thought it was a very nice area, and there were lots of secluded spots to read, take a nap, etc. There's a saltwater pool, a freshwater pool, and a large jacuzzi. We enjoyed the pool area and have no complaints. I know everyone has a different experience when they stay at a hotel, and everyone has their own expectations, requirements, etc. I'm just writing this review because I had a pretty good experience, and I don't want others to be misled by all the bad reviews on here.

I went to the club Babylon, located in Wyndham El San Juan and it was a decent club but more so filled with young people. I was told it caters to 18 and up on Fri, and 23 and up on Sat. I must say the lobby (people, singles) in the El San Juan Wyndham was more my speed but I couldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t afford $250 a night this time. Also do your bookings for a rental car online. I walked to Avis and was told they only had cars for $49 a day. However, I had already booked a reservation online while I was in the internet caf\u00c3\u00a9 next to walgreens. The car was $33 a day. The concierge couldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t even find me a good rate, so I did what I normally do, book it myself. The hotel charges $10 a day for parking with in and out priviledges. My feelings are mixed. My first room was pretty nice and with an awesome view, although I am a bit afraid of water and I am a hotel snob. As another person said, I also saw some tiny, tiny bugs. Only two though, lol. Unfortunately I had to switch rooms because someone called my room and said some sexual things. Scared me to death. They switched me to a room that took four attempts to get in. Apparently the lock wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t working that well. When I got in the room, I was not happy. The balcony door wouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t lock; no CD player and things just didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t look up to par. So I went back down and complain, this time raising my American voice. I was switched to another room that was pretty nice but the hot water wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t hot, and it was running as if it was trying to wash a baby (very slow). I complained the next day and the manager said she would send up an engineer. Correct me if I am wrong but that means, they would walk in with dirty shoes right? When I mentioned this she looked at me like I was crazy. Da hell I want them coming in a room I am staying in with dirty shoes after my room was clean. If they are engineers, they are working and usually get their shoes dirty. You know they wouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have sense to vacuum again or per request.

We visited the casino, where we couldn't even get on the roulette table. There were crowds of people surrounding the two open tables, and yet between the six dealers mulling around behind the tables, they still didn't open up either of the two other tables. We were charged $6 for a Coors Light at the casino bar, and when inquiring as to the exorbitant price, the bartender sarcastically said, \"Welcome to Condado.\" I actually booked this room through Hotwire, and was told that what I paid included taxes. But upon check out, found that we were charged an additional $18 in taxes and tariffs. I was extremely disappointed in the condition of the hotel and our floor and the service I received from staff.

The hotel was ok... just ok. It wasn't terrible, but definitely not a 4 star hotel. The room was nice; we had an oceanview which was the best part of staying there. The rooms do need a carpet upgrade but that's pretty typical of ocean front hotels. Not too bad but stained in some areas and you can tell it has been there a while. The maid service was excellent though. The restaurants looked nice, a little pricy but since we wanted to experience the culture and not Tony Romas like we have here in Ohio, we ventured out to eat. There is a nice coffee shop outside though by the valet parking that has muffins and danish for 2$ each. Nice value for breakfast when combined with the free coffee in the rooms. The Casino was nothing to write home about. They advertise it as the best in PR but we walked to the Raddison and even the Diamond Palace Hotel and found better games and machines that worked. It was a 20 minute walk and we had fun people watching while we were walking, if you like that sort of thing. The tables at Wyndam are mainly BlackJack, no Let it Ride or 3 Card Poker like they advertise so don't expect it. Also, many of their machines don't take bills and honestly, they were tight as a drum. We had more luck down the street. Even though the casinos down the street were better, if you are going on a gambling vacation, stick to Vegas, you'll win more and be able to play longer on your bankroll. The pools were nice and not crowded. We're not really into the beach scene so the fact that the beach was small and not directly on the ocean (it was located on an inlet with not many waves or anything except street people trying to sell you coconuts!) we didn't mind. If you are there for just a few nights during a cruise or something, I suppose this hotel is doable, but if you want to really experience a fine hotel and the culture, stay at the Marriott or Raddison down the street. Final note: We went to the Bahamas last year and read reviews on here saying the people of the island are rude to tourists. Not true! They were all pleasant and helpful. We read the same thing about Puerto Rico and thought nothing of it until we arrived. I got the feeling they are tired of the tourists.

Once I booked the room for a week stay, I decided to reads some reviews on it. I was really discouraged once I started to read the reviews. Even though there were only a couple of negative responses, more good then bad, I still was very doubtful. But once I checked in, I was very surprised. First off, the bus stop is right in front of the hotel, which was very convenient for us because we did a lot of traveling back and forth to old San Juan (mind you the bus ride is only a quarter). The lobby of the hotel was lovely, and the real surprise was when we checked out the room, the room was standard, but the ocean view was amazing. I feel in love right away. The private balconies were great, it felt like no one else was around. The pool elevator was perfect for going straight from you floor to the pool area, in just your bathing suit. On the other hand, the beach behind the hotel should not even be listed as one of the hotel's features because it is so tiny, but the pools make up for that. One of the pools has a slide which was listed on the hotel's features.I figured it was a straight down, boring, short slide, no, the slide was the best part of the pool, it was constructed so when your going down you don't see anyone else or when your getting close to the pool, there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a couple of turns. There were a lot of kids on it, but I tried it out and it was great. Highly recommended for adults, especially the swim up bar!!!!!!There is the condado beach, for people who want to go swimming in the ocean, which is only a couple of blocks away. I went everyday, it was a very nice short walk. One thing I have to tell you is to stay away from one of the restaurants in the hotel, Max's grill. $20 for a plate of food. Don't even bother eating there, unless if you have that kind of money. Right next door is an Italian restaurant where they have good food for a decent price.

I had just waited 2 hours in line!!! I would've just cancelled my reservation, but we had prepaid it on Priceline. We checked into our rooms, which were musty and very dirty. The carpets were very old, and the sheets were dirty. I attempted to call for a wake up call, and none of the phones in the room worked. I would be damned if I was going to go wait in line another 2 hours to ask for a different room. Then, we proceeded to hear the couple next door have 'relations'. It was so loud it was as if it was in our own room. While I understand that this can happen at any hotel, these walls were exceptionally thin. We ate lunch and dinner at the hotel (an Italian place and Max's). The food was adequate, at best. Checking out the next morning was just as much of a disaster. The 'tv' check out didn't work, the line to check out was huge. I ended up just leaving my keys and walking out. I would NOT stay here again if they paid me.

I was given a double instead of a king and after getting that resolved I was placed in a room which was cleaner than expected, although the bathtub had not been properly cleaned. The cleaning staff was really friendly, too. The following day, the person who cleaned the room did a thorough job on that bathtub. I couldn't understand why the perimeter of the bath wasn't cleaned properly. The air conditioner in my room was horrible and blew out cool extremely humid air and made me feel sick. I turned it off and opened the door to the glorious view of the ocean and the fantastic breeze. I like the way my room was furnished, I loved the bed linens, especially the feather pillows and felt comfortable and secure. The safe did not have a key and I never got one for my stay, so I wasn't happy about that. The check out lines were ridiculously long and the front desk process took way too much time. I thought that the process was absurd. This hotel is huge and it needs to have more check-in/out staff to accommodate the mass influx/exit of guests. As long as you are checking in/out off schedule, you are okay, which was my case. I arrived at 11:50a.m. and I checked out at 2:00 pm.

The area in front of it is 100% rocky, so there is no place to lay out, swim, etc. There hotel is next to and has a gate to a sandy area that is sort of a beach(filled with butts, and bottles, considering it is where the locals go), but is actually a 100% waveless alcove off from the coast area.

The hotel is still lovely, but it is beginning to show its age. The marble floors in the lobby are showing spots of heavy wear and tear. The huge aquarium is a nice touch, but the spacing of the nite club proximity is too close to the telephones. I was trying to make a phone call, and I couldn't hear. I arrived at the hotel on April 29, 2004 around 12:00 p.m. and my room was not ready. I belong to the Wyndham by Request and had requested an oceanview room. I did not get into my room until 3:15 p.m. after several trips to the front desk. They did offer to upgrade me to the Plaza level, however, there were no more oceanview suites. They did offer to put me on the lagoon side, but I opted for the full breakfast buffet vouchers instead. The plaza level comes with a deluxe continental breakfast, but it is not better than the buffet especially for someone with a healthy appetite like myself. The room was nice with a oceanview that was incredible. I could see cruise ships at night on the horizon and parasailing and jetskiing during the day. The breeze never ceased and I slept with the balcony door open every night.The bathroom amenities were more than you ask for. The only problem with the bathroom was when you took a shower, it took a long timefor the water to leave the tub. I did not want to go thru the hassle of asking for another room as I fell in love with the view, so I just imagined I had my feet in the water at the beach. This was a minor problem and did not affect my trip. Speaking of the beach, they have a small one on the side of the hotel, but it is a public beach and the take advantage of it. There is a path to the beach from the gorgeous pool area with security stationed at the entrance to keep anyone who is not a guest from entering the property unless they are with you of course. They have three pools at the hotel, one on the lagoon side and two on the main side. The saltwater pool is 6ft deep , the regular pool is approx 4ft deep with a volleyball net , water slide, and swim up bar. There is a jacuzzi which is nice. All the pools are open 24 hours, so enjoy! The jacuzzi gets a little busy late at night as the weather has cooled off a bit. In the midst of the pools is Las Palmas, a restaurant with reasonably priced snacks and lite meals. It is open and has nice breezes blowing all the time. The swim up bar closes at 12:00 am. There is a separate pool elevator available to guests that they prefer you use from the evening on as they have a certain atmosphere they try to maintain. No swimsuits in the lobby at night. They would prefer use wear slacks for men and appropiate evening wear for the ladies. They are not stuffy but want you dress a little bit at night ( not formal ). The hotel has six restaurants from a deli to a onsite Tony Roma's. The buffet is served at Max's and is not cheap, I had vouchers so I really could not tell you how much it was, but I did hear my friends say between 10 and 15. There is a nice place a few doors down from the hotel that has a great breakfast special for $5.50. The hotel concierge has all the info on the tours which range from 30 - 100.00 . My advice to you is rent a car for at least one day across the street at Charlies and do Puerto Rico your way. Also, I noticed a faint smell of mildew on the hallway carpets which seems to be a problem with a lot of hotels in the carribean. I wish they all had tiles.

The grounds were very well maintained and the hotel and accomadations were great. (be sure to request a room on the ocean side, the lagoon view is quite a walk from everything) The hotel has about 6 different restaurants and a casino. They also have a disco at night. (lots to do). Its location is great because you can walk down the street and go to some great ethnic restaurants which are reasonably priced. There also is a salt water pool, freshwater, and swim up bar. Also a very big hot tub! We met people from all over the world...a very diversified group, all very friendly. The lagoon is a protected one, which means they have shark nets so you don;t have to worry about that. We went in Nov of 03....the water temp was perfect in the lagoon and it was crystal clear. I really liked Puerto Rico, because there was lots to do. The only problem we had was check in. The hotel said that their system was down and no one could check in. They didn;t get this mess fixed until after 3:30. A very long time to wait to get settled especially with a 7am flight. We had been up since 4:30. If you have this problem be persistant, stay in the lobby area and wait....it turned out to be first come first serve...so the people who went to the bar with a free drink voucher they handed out...missed out once the rooms became available.
