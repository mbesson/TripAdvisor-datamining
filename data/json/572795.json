However, make sure when you book that they can accommodate you in the dining room over your stay, where the food is gourmet-quality and reasonably priced. Otherwise, you may find yourself surviving on day-old sandwiches in your room. The seven or eight nearby dining spots we tried when Bremon's dining room was fully booked were either closed, full, or not willing to serve us. Bremon took pity on us and served us a delicious meal in our own private dining room, but we were the exception. Other than that, the rooms are clean, modern, attractive and comfortable. The lounge, lobby and (particularly) the staff are welcoming. And the breakfasts are great. For excursions, try to book a meal at the parador in Cardona (well in advance) and take a full day to explore Mura (fantastic drive). The monastery at Mont Serrat is also worth a day's visit either going or coming from Cardona (go early). This spot would have gotten five stars from us if food had been readily available.", "Date": "Oct 1, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR514375400", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "2"}, "Author": "JOlive-Oil"}, {"Content": "Very pleasant stay This is a very charming hotel in a charming locale. Rooms are not huge, but very sleek, clean and warm without being overly modern. You can tell the hotel is new, but it retains a nice classicism.The bed is the most comfortable in Spain, especially for those weary of hard mattresses. And the views are gorgeous from tall windows that overlook the prettiest area of the city.Bremon is a great bargain for what it is. The only downside is that breakfast is not included in price. However, the restaurant on premisis is very affordable and of good quality. The staff is also really great. I felt like Hemingway in Europe at this place.The only downside is finding Cardona.", "Date": "Jun 13, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR909891920", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "flyingdutchmanmi"}, {"Content": "Fabulous Hotel Hotel Bremon is fabulous!My husband and I shared a gorgeous room with tasteful decor, a great bath, and all the amenities you could want-even chocolate.The staff was very helpful in providing restaurant recommendations, a town map, and discount coupons for nearby tourist attractions.We had a wonderful experience and would highly recommend Hotel Bremon.", "Date": "Sep 28, 2006", "ReviewID": "UR504217394", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "Luwak"}], "HotelInfo": {"HotelURL": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g187497-d572795-r21227607-Hotel_Bremon-Barcelona_Catalonia.html", "HotelID": "572795", "Price": "$140"}}
