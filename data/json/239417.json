We didn't speak the same language but always managed to accomplish what we wanted. Very helpful with maps of the city and ride back to the airport. Clean and very pleasant, small, but perfect room and bathroom. I could walk to all the museums and plazas as well as several cathedrals. I'd stay here again in a minute.

The location could NOT have been better - walking distance from the \"big three\" museums, Plaza Mayor and other big time cultural centers. I did not have to take a cab or metro once from the hostel. The management does not speak English, but they are so patient and accommodating that I got along fine with my extremely broken Spanish! The room was small but what I expected for a single room, and the bathroom facilities were also small, but worked just fine. They clean up after you each day and make the bed, clean the bathroom, etc. I never had a problem with street noise except during futbol games, but that's half the fun :) I definitely recommend this place if you're on a budget and just looking for a nice, clean facility to stay in Madrid.", "Date": "May 14, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Issaquah, Washington", "Title": "\u201cSmall rooms but clean with great location and excellent price!\u201d", "Author": "AceBuffe", "ReviewID": "UR129437640", "Content": "Jaen is in a great location.

It is located very close to Las Huertas which has great places to go out, Plaza de Santa Ana which has incredible dinner spots, near the metro at Anton Martin, and also very close to Puerta del Sol (the center of Madrid!) It is on the 3rd floor of the building but there was a nice little elevator that can take you up. I'm not sure if the owner spoke English but he realized that we weren't fluent in Spanish so he spoke slowly & simply and was very helpful and nice. The room was very cute! The decorations were wonderful & the double room came with a nice sized bathroom & shower, small balcony facing the courtyard, closet, a hairdryer, and free Wi-Fi. The other nights we spent in Madrid we stayed a little closer to Sol and it was very loud! At Hostal Jaen with our window facing the courtyard it was nice & quiet even late at night. We paid 45 euros for 1 night and it was definitely a wonderful deal! Plus check out isn't until noon which is usually nice.", "Date": "May 23, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "usa", "Title": "\u201cGOOD VALUE, CLEAN , GOOD LOCATION,\u201d", "Author": "charlieseven", "ReviewID": "UR60991884", "Content": "We spent 10 days in this Hostal . the owner was very helpful and informative.

The owners even cooked dinner and ate in the dining room in the apartment unit too! It was quite close to the Anton Martin stop on the subway light blue line (#8?) but we were able to just walk everywhere we wanted to visit (closest sights is Casa de Lope de Vega just down the street, and is in between Prado Museum, Thyssen-Bornemisza Museum, and Puerta de Sol) We had a room just behind the front desk and it overlooked a hotel's or restaurant's outdoor space with canopy, so it was quite pretty. I was happy to see the floor-to-ceiling window. The furniture was basic, with a bed, night table with drawers, armoire, desk, TV, chairs and hooks on the wall for jackets (I liked!). There was a tub in the bathroom and I thought it was funny that the bathroom is connected to the room not only by the door but also a \"peek window\" that reminds me of Japanese love hotels. The owners were so friendly although the husband who checked us in and out spoke almost no English. His daughter spoke English though.
