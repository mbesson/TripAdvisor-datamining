The staff was extremely friendly & helpful. Rooms were clean but not spotless as there was the black mold around the bathtub caulking - a big turn off! Light breakfast consisted of rolls, hard boiled eggs, waffles & cereal. The building just needed some maintainance - curb appeal, front desk , stairwells. It was also located by a busy road which quieted down by 8;00 Of the five different Choice hotels we stayed at on this trip I would rate this at the bottom. The last night we were there two young men decided to pull the tires off a car, do something to the steering and play loud music outside our window until around 8:00 when they finally got the car running. I think there could have been a better place to overhaul a car! The other hotels were decorated for fall inside and out while this one just had a few things around the dining area. It was an ok place for 1 or 2 nights.", "Date": "October 23, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "New York", "Title": "\u201cClose to airport\u201d", "Author": "books30", "ReviewID": "UR119569046", "Content": "We stayed here after a week traveling in Tenn. as we had a morning flight. We got a very reasonable rate. If you get a low rate,it is all right. Since it's close to the airport, you hear planes ealry in the morning. Breakfast was standard. Near Graceland also. Not the newest Comfort Inn but it was clean,comfortable and staff was nice. The friendly woman at the desk told us about a good BBQ restaurant near Graceland and a singer was performing Friday night. The place was hopping. Sorry I don't remeber the name, we ate in quite a few good BBQ restaurants in Memphis.

This hotel was basically lean and well kept but an older property. If you were to just put me in the room and ask me to guess the brand, I would have said it was an Econolodge. That brand tends to be older, fewer frills and its quality can vary from quite good to very bad. (If this were an Econolodge I would have said it was a good one. As a Confort Inn I would rate it as a bit less than I expect.) The price was good and the check in staff was friendly and helpful. We had a rare day off and asked about a shuttle to Graceland, which they do offer-- Graceland is a couple of blocks away. The shuttle is the same price as parking at the attraction, so it is not much of a benefit. I do not know if they charge to take the shuttle to and from the airport as well. I have one particular pet peeve that will keep me from visiting this hotel again. We have a routine when traveling. We often check in late and work late. In order for my partner to preserve his energy for our tour, I get up early and get breakfast for him and we eat in the room. I also dislike having all the noise of all the people around in the morning. Occasionally we run into a hotel where there is a sign that says \"breakfast is to be eaten only in the breakfast room.\" Usually it is in an Econolodge, not a more upscale brand. In this hotel, as I was pouring coffee, a worker in the breakfast area noticed my tray and said \"breakfast is not for your room.\" When I pay for a room that includes breakfast, I like to be able to eat it. So I make a note never to stay in these properties a second time. This may not be a problem for every traveler, but it is my pet peeve and we have a lot of options.", "Date": "July 3, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Mangalore", "Title": "\u201cConvenient accomodation\u201d", "Author": "EMAILLAG", "ReviewID": "UR90739191", "Content": "Comfort inn and comfort suites are different.

We usually stay at the Heartbreak Hotel, but decided to save some money and try the Comfort Inn. Beware, that the area of town is not the best, but don't let that spoil the Hotel. Also the hotel is near the Airport, and sometimes it is very loud. Also, the area has a lot of truck places and a lot of truckers stay at the hotel. The hotel lobby was very nice and open. We really liked the nice lobby and the entry way. We arrived at the Hotel around 10AM to make our reservation, and surprising we could already check in. The front desk staff was very friendly and helpful. Our room was clean and everything was in it's place. The room had a small microwave and a small fridge, two double beds, a comfy chair, a 22 inch TV. The bathroom was very clean, and the shower water pressure was awesome! We only had two complaints about the room. The first one was that there was small cob webs hanging from the ceiling trim. The second compliant was that the heater really smelt bad when turned on. The hotel offered a free breakfast, and it looked okay and there was a good variety, but we didn't have time to eat. Over all, this is a clean hotel and the room was very cozy.

We spent the afternoon at the Pink Palace Museum and the evening on Beale St. and checked into the hotel around 11pm. We liked the location because we wanted to get to Graceland as soon as it opened the next morning and this hotel is only a few minutes away. I used Choice Privileges points so I did not pay anything for the stay. Check-in was speedy. The room was adequate. The king bed was very comfortable. There was a refrigerator and microwave. The sink area was very large and looked brand new. The shower was a little older, and while it worked fine, there are obvioulsy no water restrictors in place because the water pressure was so strong that it was LOUD. Our toilet actually started leaking in the morning and we reported it to the front desk clerk who promptly wrote it up. The only gripe about this hotel is that because of its proximity to the airport, it can get a little loud. I was awakened a couple times because I heard was I thought was loud traffic, but it was actually plane engines firing up at 3am and 4am. I couldn't believe that commercial flights would be taking off from the Memphis airport at that hour, but I later learned that the FedEx headquarters is in Memphis and every shipment goes in and out of Memphis before it gets routed to its final destination... so the planes I heard were FedEx planes. I'm not sure if staying on the opposite side of the hotel would be quieter... we were in room 103. Of course, the planes didn't wake my husband, so I guess it depends on how heavy a sleeper you are. Breakfast was adequate. I love it when hotels have waffle makers. :) We were planning on getting up early to use the fitness room, but we slept longer than we wanted to (too much fun on Beale St.). The machines looked new... there was a treadmill, an elliptical machine and a stationary bike. I would probably stay here again if I was passing through, but I would request a room farther from the highway and the airport noise, if that is even possible.", "Date": "December 31, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "2", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Arkansas", "Title": "\u201cOK but nothing special\u201d", "Author": "Richbutnot", "ReviewID": "UR41082408", "Content": "We stayed here one night over labor day weekend while meeting up with my in-laws and our son in college.
