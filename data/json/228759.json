Yes, it is noisy--you are steps away from Rue de Rivoli and Paris traffic will definitely be heard through the double pane windows. If this is a problem, then the hotel may not be the best choice. I stayed in a single room (32)--the bathroom was sparkling clean, the room clearly also well attended though one does notice that the carpet is well past its expiration date and the wall paper past its prime. Even with these slight blemishes, the hotel manages to have a certain charm. The turn down service was a lovely touch, though it missed a chocolate on the pillow. The price of the hotel is determined by its location and its charming elegance without the extravagant prices that can be attached to such places in Paris. I would stay there again though I might ask for an interior room. Also, the rack rates of the hotel seem absolutely high for what it offers, but if there are special rates then I would consider staying here again. The bed was very firm, the sheets very smooth and the pillows comfortable though not top of the line and not what we are now used to get at the big American chains. For a European independent hotel, they were more than adequate (and I am fussy). If you like to sink into a soft bed, you would be disappointed. The service was indeed very good and, for Paris, incredibly \\welcoming. If you request a cab to the CDG airport, opt for the flat fee one. Because the hotel calls the cab and you pay for the fare of the cab arriving at the hotel, you will find that it is a less expensive option.

Our room was much larger than I'd expected, and we had a balcony with a view of the Tuilleries. The whole hotel was sparkling clean and the staff was kind and extremely polite. They made restaurant reservations for us, answered our questions, accepted my less-than-perfect French but also spoke English (and many other languages). It's true that breakfast is a bit pricey, but no more so than any other place in the immediate area (and less expensive than at the Imperial Cafe at the corner).

And L'Hotel Mayfair is in the heart of Le Premier Arondissement, so The Mayfair should be expensive. However, when you throw $300 a night for a dorm-sized single, I think it is fair to expect GREAT service. The front desk was a hassle, and very rude about every request, such as a wake-up call or a taxi service. You can rent a laptop for e-mail purposes for 50 Euro/30 mins, which is absurd! So I asked the front desk to print out a ticket I needed to go to La Musee d'Orsay, and they took forever to do it, and I ended up just snapping a screenshot of myiPhone and showed it to the clerks at the museum, and luckily that worked. You can go to any hostel in town and get 30 minutes of internet for 3 euro. Which is what I suggest if you are forced to stay here. However, the cleaning staff and concierges were excellent and accomodating, it is the front desk who tries their hardest to ruin your stay in this beautiful and storied city.

Checked in at 3pm only to find my room wasn't ready - had to wait in the lounge for 10 minutes, wasn't offered a drink or anything else. Porter showed me up to room 51 - this was a deluxe room with terrace, something I love to have as I'm a smoker and prefer not to smoke in my room. The room itself was adequately furnished - at first glance the king size bed looked like 2 singles put together, but that turned out just to be the base and the mattress was a full kingsize. Plenty of storage room and a good-sized desk. The bathroom was unusual in that it had a large corner bath tucked away in an alcove, a shower overhead but no shower curtain. The tub itself had seen better days and didn't look very inviting. The soundproofing was perfect due to the double set of windows - ideal as this hotel is just off the busy Rue de Rivoli. Bed was comfortable, so no issues with sleep. Breakfast in the morning was a little limited due to the absence of any hot food - only after I'd finished did I notice the sign saying bacon & eggs were available on request. Plenty of rolls, fruit and cold meats, if that's your thing. I had three main gripes about this place. Firstly the charge for WiFi access - honestly, it's 2010, and really time that hotels began offering this as standard. Some do, the rest should follow. It was only \u00e2\u201a\u00ac10 for 24 hours, but it's a pain having to go down to reception to get an access code. Secondly, there were no coffee-making facilities in the room. I'd expect better for a deluxe room. And thirdly, something I have never seen before in all my years of business travel: this hotel attempts to stop guests from bringing in their own food and drink, with notices in the room and stuck to the minibar. When I'm travelling, I often nip to the shops for drinks and a sandwich as I don't really like eating out alone. I walked back into the hotel with a supermarket bag full of stuff - nobody said anything but I rather wish they had. It's an argument I would have enjoyed having. Overall then, not a bad choice - very centrally located and comfortable enough, but lacking too many little things for me to choose to stay here again.

Our room at the Mayfair (photo) was by far the most spacious than anything previously experienced by us. Our first trip was extremely budget-conscious and we stayed in a two-star hotel in Clichy. For our second visit, we stayed in the Left Bank in a tourist hotel on the rue Mouffetard. Both visits were highly enjoyable, but I felt we spent an inordinate amount of time just getting to and from the hotels. So, this time we booked a four-night trip to Paris as a package deal but decided to upgrade the hotel, primarily for a better (more central) location in order to minimize the Metro/commuting time between hotel and restaurant, hotel and shopping, hotel and museums, etc. We decided on the Hotel Mayfair in the First Arrondissement, a little rich for our budget. However, this four-star hotel did not disappoint, and was well worth the added cost in terms of overall and intangible value. The location of the Mayfair, situated just off the rue de Rivoli, is very central and convenient to many popular sites as well as a variety of nearby Metro stations. A few hundred yards to the right (west) is Place de la Concorde and the bottom end of the Champs Elysees; directly across the rue de Rivoli is Tuileries and the Orangerie museum, and just beyond that, the Seine. To the left (east) a few hundred meters stands the Louvre. Immediately to the north is Place Vendome and the rue Saint Honore. One of the very best things about staying at the Mayfair was that, unlike our previous Paris visits, we were able to come back to our home base in mid-afternoon if need be, or pop in again to freshen up or grab an umbrella without dedicating a lot of additional time to commuting. There was also plenty of time in late afternoon to return to the hotel, to nap, bathe, and dress for dinner. The immaculate bathroom (photos) was very large, modern, and luxurious; the bedroom was (for us) elegantly appointed and very comfortable. Staff are friendly, helpful, multi-lingual, and can assist with everything from securing a restaurant reservation to booking a taxi for those travelers who are not confident enough in their French to pick up a Parisian telephone (like us). Our standard double room overlooked an airshaft (so what?) but was very tranquil, including the dawn chorus of sparrows and mourning doves singing away in the Tuileries, which was no hardship at all. Morning breakfast was outstanding, and included everything imaginable for a diverse international clientele.... from stewed prunes and mueslix for health conscious vacationers, to bacon and eggs-any-style for the Brits and Yanks, to the more predictable, yet delicious freshly baked croissants and coffee rolls, to camembert, fresh fruit, yogurts, juices, breads, etc. The Mayfair's breakfast buffet even included the deli meats and cheeses favored by Scandanavian travelers. On the down-side, if there is one, the Mayfair's close proximity to Place Vendome and the rue Saint Honore (and the luxury associated with those places) definitely added to the cost of locally-consumed meals (which, by the way were uniformly EXQUISITE). That is not to say that the area is not also dotted with affordable and excellent bistros (photo), bars, and cafes, plus a variety of very attractive ethnic Asian restaurants. The posted nightly rate for this hotel is rather steep (photo) for budget-minded travelers like us, but, as a package deal upgrade, it was worth the added costs when trying to balance hotel location against limited time.", "Date": "March 31, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Norway", "Title": "\u201cCosy and stylish hotel in almost perfect location\u201d", "Author": "SF_by_Air", "ReviewID": "UR59404488", "Content": "We stayed five nights in the hotel and had nothing to complain about.

Spacious room, but the slanting roof was an issue for my husband who is 6 ft 2. We were awoken the next morning at 8 a.m by noisy trash trucks...and so we switched to a superior double facing the courtyard. Not much of a view, much quieter and smaller but spacious enough. There was only a 20 euro difference in price. We tried to have breakfast included since we switched to the smaller room, but we were told it would not be included. We ate breakfast at numerous cafes in the areas which I much preferred. I like exploring new places and getting the feel of an area. I agree with the other poster about the \"do not put anything in the refrigerator\" note. Not what I would call welcoming. I like to buy my own water, cheese and fruit but this wasn't possible. We needed to check out a day early because of illness and we were told we would still have to pay for the room. It seems that the hotel could have been more accommodating.

Perhaps we are too used to the American level of service in nice hotels, but there were a few things we felt we not to our satisfaction, Air France lost one of our bags, and the hotel was not proactive at all in helping us communicate with Air France and get the bag delivered in a timely matter. The didn't go out of their way to be an advocate with the airline. Also, our in-room safe malfunctioned, and when we calle dto have someone come up and open it in the evening, we were told that the manager had left for the day and that we would have to wait until the morning. Lastly, we had supposedly equal 3 rooms, and two of them were beautiful, while one was so small that we could barely lay our suitcases open on the floor (there was no where else to put them), and had to step over them to get to the bathroom or the door.

Unfortunately we were totally disappointed with the experience as it did not live up to even the qualities of a 3 star property. On the plus side, the location is really convenient. Unfortunately, that is the only plus we found. Though we had reservations, the first room they showed us was incredibly small, dingy and looked over an interior air-shaft so we declined and asked to see something else. They said another room would be available later that day. So we stored our luggage and went touring. When we returned after 5:00 pm they showed us a beautiful deluxe room that we could have for an additional 100 euros a night or a truly horrible room that was filthy (stains on the carpet and bedspread) and reeked of smoke. We negotiated and ended up with the Deluxe room for an extra 50 euros a night. Not great, but at least we could breathe while we were sleeping. Though the various gentlemen who worked at the reception desk during the evening and night were very helpful and friendly, the women who worked the desk during the daytime were incredibly rude.

We then entered the lounge area where the decoration was in a better state. However, the double bed that we had booked turned out to be 2 twin beds pushed together. We considered this to be unacceptable at at tariff of over \u00e2\u201a\u00ac300 so asked for another room. We were then transferred to a standard room which at least appeared clean and dry. It is clear though that the hotel is in need of some improvement and modernisation. The room that we were moved to was small but did have a queen size bed. This redeeming feature was negated by the only pillows provided being two small squares which were only just big enough for your head. The bathroom was also in need of some repair. The shower head hose had been replaced with a cheap version that didn't hold the shower head correctly resulting in more of a garden sprinkler effect than a shower. The final insult was the view from the room. We had originally booked the suite which was meant to have a superb view of Paris. Instead we ended up with a view of the back end of the hotel in a room we didn't want. You can share this in the picture below. There was no apology from the staff who blamed the agency for not booking a double bed in our suite. This didn't quite explain why there were twin beds pushed together instead.

The hotel location is very central (just off rue de Rivoli) and proximity to metro Concorde makes travel around Paris convenient. Many major sights are within easy walking distance: Tuilerie, Louvre, Place Vendome, Place Concorde, Madeleine, Opera, Champs Elysee, etc. On the other hand, hotel surrounding are rather \u00e2\u20ac\u0153posh\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd and there is no \u00e2\u20ac\u0153real\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Parisian life around (no boulangeries, fromageries, food shops, street markets and similar, only luxurious hotels, boutiques and offices). I booked a single room w/o breakfast for 172 euro but upon arrival was placed into a ground floor duplex consisting of two double rooms sharing the same bathroom. The room entrance was conveniently located just ten meters from the reception, but the downside was the view from the windows: into a small and dark courtyard. Room furniture was antique, not too beautiful and not very convenient, but I liked the pure and simple impression the room design left (accentuated by a flat-screen TV). The bathroom was very spacious, with a separate toilet accessible through the door from the bathroom. bathroom fixtures were modern and new. The room was quiet and the bed comfortable. Air-conditioning was functioning well. Where Mayfair is not up to its 4 star rating is with the breakfast. The selection and the quality of the offering are simply poor. No good bread, no good cheese, no good ham. No fresh vegetables. Is this hotel located in Paris? On the positive side, my omelet with champignons (has to be ordered from the staff) was quite good and not salty at all. Some fresh fruit was also available. Overall, breakfast is poor value for money and not at the level of a 4 star hotel. Hotel staff was helpful and pleasant.

We ended up getting a Visite pass and took the RER/Metro from CDG. Very easy if you are fit and can carry your bags up and down all the stairs. It was about a 5 minute walk from the Concorde metro station to the hotel. I also strongly recommend getting a museum pass - it saved us tons of time not having to wait in lines and is a good value if you expect to see a bunch of sights. Back to the Mayfair - the staff were very friendly and welcoming - despite our poor French language skills. We skipped breakfast - 20 EU per person was ridiculous. They had English language newspapers off the lobby every day which was nice. Location was fine if this is a first trip to Paris (it wasn't for us) - Rue de Rivoli is just too touristy for us - next time we will stay near Ille St Louis or somewhere with some more character and some local markets and bakeries nearby. We did have a great early morning jog to Plaza de Concorde, down Champs de Lysee (pardon spelling errors!) to Arch de Triumphe and down the Seine. Also, being near the Concorde metro station was very convenient - we traveled all over and never had more than 2 transfers per trip. On the negative side, the beds were hard as boards - very uncomfortable. We did have a nice quiet room which faced the inside courtyard - I would definitely recommend that. all in all, it was fine but I do not think it was worth the $310 US per day in comparison to some other hotels we saw in different areas. We did have some difficulty with our safe- the directions for setting the code had been translated into English incorrectly - we hand wrote the corrections ourselves (after hotel security came up to help reset it for us) - so hopefully future guests won't meet the same fate.", "Date": "June 12, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "2", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "North Carolina", "Title": "\u201cGreat Location Friendly Service TERRIBLE COFFEE\u201d", "Author": "ILOVEPARIS2", "ReviewID": "UR6743847", "Content": "I had the pleasure of staying at the Mayfair at the end of a two week visit to Venice and Paris. I only spent one night but the most impressive aspect of the Mayfair is the Customer Service. Lori and the entire daytime staff treated me like an old friend. Lovely large bathroom with towel warmer and big deep bathtub. After 2 weeks of cold weather and dashing about it was a welcome relief to take a long leisurely bubble bath. There were nice bath products as well as a vanity area. The bed was a little hard but the room was spacious and lobby was charming. There is nothing that hasn't been said about the location. It's fabulous. And again the daytime staff was beyond reproach. Adorable Christmas Tree in the reception area. Very personalized services by day staff in every way. Even an umbrella stand full of nice large umbrellas available for guests. A really nice touch. The staff, particulary Lori, went out of their way. BUT: EXCEPTION: The late night auditor who was on duty the evening of December 30-very unpleasant and when I asked to purchase a 30 minute Internet Access Card he told me that all he had left were 1 hour cards. A ridiculous inconvenience and expense. I was the only one using the Business Center that night. In my opinion they should NEVER be conveniently OUT of 30 minute Access Cards. TERRIBLE COFFEE AT BREAKFAST: The most important part of my breakfast is always the coffe. The Mayfairs COFFEE IS TERRIBLE. UNDRINKABLE. I've had coffee and that is not coffee. It's a weak, dishwater messy concoction they CALL coffee. I had better coffee on the overnight Artesian Night Train from Venice. Since nobody could unintentionally make coffee that bad I came to the conclusion that the Mayfair must INTEND for it to be that bad so you don't want more. Truly terrible. MINI BAR: Prices for items in the mini bar were reasonable enough; however, there was no posting in the room OF those prices and there should be. I don't mind paying for these things when I am on vacation but what I do NOT like are surprises and the feeling that there is no full disclosure. Let's face it if you want/need a Perrier at 1AM you're going to take it from the mini bar and I loved the selection and convenience. but what I do NOT like is the feeling that something re: the prices is not properly being disclosed.

The staff is friendly, helpful, and quite capable in English (the woman who checked us in, and the woman in the breakfast area were especially nice). Everything was handled fine including checking in and out, billing, wake-up calls, etc. The public areas were well decorated, with high ceilings and a kind of classic look. Everything was very clean, and well - polished. The hotel is relatively small and everything is relaxed and reasonably personal. Two elevators are available for the 5-6 floors. The modern elevator is sufficiently large - the other elevator is an old-fashioned circular wooden one about large enough for 1-2 people and which my wife always enjoyed using. The weather forecast is posted each day by the large elevator on the ground floor. Umbrellas ( if needed ) are available near the front desk. USA Today was available on the way to the dining area. A locked, luggage-storage room near reception is available for early arrivees ( which we were ). We liked our room. There was sufficient space, plenty of storage, and everything worked fine including the safe, TV, AC, hair dryer, hot water, shower, etc. The room was attractively decorated and furnished, and our king-sized bed was very comforable - we slept great as the hotel was quite quiet. We had requested via email for a nonsmoking room facing the street and that is what we got. Also had a small balcony large enough to hold some containers of geraniums ( this was on the 3rd floor ). The bathroom was reasonably large and housekeeping kept everything well maintained.There was a built-in adaptor for an American-style electric shaver. The showerhead could either be positioned as usual or be handheld as a spray. Everything was fairly normal, though it was an above-average step out of the tub, and although there was always plenty of fresh towels there was no sign of washclothes ( probably it's bring your own if you can't do without ). Next to the shower-bath, is a retractable \" clothesline\" which can be pulled out and attached to the opposite wall. One is expected to leave the room key at the front desk on each leaving of the hotel which is no big deal - one less thing to carry around all day and it probably helps with security. Our package came with the continental breakfast which we used every day and thought was convenient and satisfactory - my wife thought the hot chocolate was very good. The continental and full buffets were both located at the same serving \" table\", but it's easy enough to differientiate the two, since they are very adequately described on the menu at every table and the hostess also explains it.
