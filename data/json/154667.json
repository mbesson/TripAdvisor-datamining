{"Reviews": [{"Content": "loved it! The Mallorca Hotel is great. The price is excellent (about $25 USD a night), for a large clean room, cable TV, clean bathroom. The cafe/restaurant downstairs is good. It's a bit far from the very center of town, but you are near Ave. Insurgentes. I also stayed in a hostel for $20 a night in mexico city, to share a room with 3 other people, and it was awful. I should have stayed the rest of the trip at the Mallorca Hotel. Most of the staff do not speak English too well, so I would keep a phrase book handy if you don't speak spanish.", "Date": "Aug 6, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR165710994", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "3"}, "Author": "madisonannie53703"}, {"Content": "Great price for great stay       Entrance of hotel", "Date": "Mar 2, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR412617940", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "3", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "Glorisa"}, {"Content": "Safe and comfy! Safe, comfy, and warm. Bottled water provided. Good coffee and omelets available downstairs. Good neighborhood near art park. Can walk to Zocalo, but it's long, hot and tiring. Near buses to museums, just be sure you get on the right one! Gigante Supermarket right next door has everything you need. 7-11 nearby for fuel.

The price includes the taxes and room service and for each day a bottle of water (500 cc). The hotel is very clean and is walk distance from the zocalo, historic downtown. The name of the neighbourhood is Colonia San Rafael, for me it was a safe zone as it is plenty of policemen.It has TV only with some cable channels, it has central air conditioning but not good, the room was big and with carpet, the bathroom has a powerful shower.", "Date": "Aug 21, 2005", "ReviewID": "UR258582323", "Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "3", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "DavidZ"}], "HotelInfo": {"HotelURL": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g150800-d154667-r18699568-Mallorca_Hotel-Mexico_City_Central_Mexico_and_Gulf_Coast.html", "HotelID": "154667", "Price": "$19"}}
