It has grand marble stairs and everything was very clean. A great hot breakfast was included. There are lots of great restaurants in the area, plus it is only a few blocks to the riverfront foot bridge, the Opera, etc. What a great place to stay if you need to be at the Airport for a flight the next day. We were able to leave the hotel, walk to the train station and be at the airport in just 15 minutes (10 of which was the train ride). There is a free Internet computer in the lobby and the front desk staff spoke flawless English and was very friendly and helpful.", "Date": "Aug 13, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR404488390", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "Maquoketa Mark"}, {"Content": "Clean hotel with friendly staff.

My stay at the Victoria Hotel in Frankfurt was a pleasant one, The hotel is very basic, clean, central and the staff was friendly and very helpful. Breakfast was also very good. We were 2 people on this trip and booked a triple room which was the same price as a twin room at the time. The room was spacious and the bathroom very clean.

We had to climb over the bed and our 2 suitcases to get to the bathroom (also tiny but functional - hair dryer  hot shower) and the door. The beds are comfortable but very low to the floor and our room smelled of stale cigarette smoke even though it was supposed to be a non-smoking room. The staff was very helpful and nice - they were very happy to offer suggestions on restaurants, shopping and getting around town. They had a nice complimentary breakfast buffet that may have seemed like an odd combination of foods - seafood salad, salami, smoked salmon, soft boiled eggs and lots of breads... also cereal, yogurt and fruit. Yes, it is in the 'red light' district but it felt very safe at night - and since most of the attractions and shopping are either a few metro stops away or a 20 minute walk away, you're likely not to be spending much time in the area. All in all we good a good nights sleep and a filling breakfast for a decent rate. Be sure to check the rates for different days.Small but good for the money, helpful staff and close to the metro.

We just stayed at the Victoria..........both at beginning and ending of our trip. During the first stay of two nights, the hotel was booked except for one room, which we got. It was rather small and tired looking, but clean. Our bicycles had been lost by the airlines and we were needing a place to hang til they arrived. The staff all speak excellent English and were very helpful. They even called the airline for us to see if they could help find our bikes. The hotel is in the red light district, but we never felt threatened. It is a bit noisy...you might want to wear earplugs while sleeping. The breakfast buffett was excellent with a vast selection of meats, cheeses, breads, etc. and the option to order eggs as well. On our second stay we were given a lovely, large corner room.

The staff was attentive and friendly. My room was small but very clean, functional, and quiet. I especially appreciated how my room was ready for early check-in when I arrived after my overnight flight, and Herr Klotz even offered me late breakfast, coffee, etc. right at check in. (It's things like this that gain repeat customers.) Breakfast choices were somewhat limited but well presented and service was quite good. Granted, the hotel is in the red light district, but this presented no safety concerns at all. Very short walk to U-Bahn station, good bakery across the street. Certainly would recommend this hotel and got a good rate of $77.00 on Expedia.
