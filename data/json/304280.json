We loved picking where we were going to eat dinner in one of their incredible rooms surrounded by antique pieces of Bali's history. We loved the spa and especially the outdoor spa and the wonderful therapist they have there. We loved our room that felt like a lovely suite in a friends house, so unique and special. And we loved every minute we got to stay and enjoy the wonderful staff of the Tugu.My daughter is a surfer and I think Canngu was her favorite place to surf and it is right in front of the hotel. There were a few other surfers from around the world staying there and they all had a good time together. I would have coffee brought out to the lounges on the beach and have never enjoyed my morning coffee more! I walked the beach and it is peaceful, safe and interesting. There are a few restaurants north of the hotel but we ate all our meals at the hotel and I am not sorry...the meals were fabulous. This is an amazing, special place that if you have the chance to stay there, you should. I cannot wait to go to their new hotel on Lombok.", "Date": "Nov 11, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR956492834", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "kklynn"}, {"Content": "This is a museum We stayed here for 4 nights on our honeymoon and I was a little dissapointed.. the hotel is fenced off for security and is set back from the beach. The ocean here has loads of rocks, and is more ideal for experienced surfers that sunbathing. the beach had about 6 deck chairs for the hotel guests, but that too was set back and a little ramshackled looking, so we spent lots of time at the pool. We only discovered then that the hotel also labels itself as a museum hotel, so is filled with antiques and the same dark musty vibe that accompanies museums. That said: the service was exceptional (one can eat anywhere and anytime - they will set up a table anywhere on their premises) and our room was nice, but i found it all too rustic for the price we were paying. Our highlight was discovering the Italian owned Sticky Fingers on Echo Beach close by, where we spent ages on their roof terrace, sipping marvellously massive cocktails (at half the price of the hotel's and twice the size), overlooking the ocean and surfers.

After extensive research utilizing this website (as well as others) we decided on Tugu Bali for our 4 night stay in Bali. We were originally planning on staying in Ubud, but were unable to secure reservations on short notice. We must say that the experience at Tugu Bali left absolutely nothing to be desired. From the driver who picked us up at the airport, to the receptionist who checked us in, to the chefs, to the wait staff....we cannot rave enough about this place! As an aside, we STRONGLY suggest that anyone flying into Bali secure a hotel which features VIP pickup service at the airport. The driver will somehow manage to secure the visa for you and whisk you through customs in less than 10 minutes. Had we not had this service provided to us by the Tugu, we would have had to wait in a 1.5 hour line in a terminal with weak A/C!! Getting back to the hotel. The unique part of the Tugu is that, unlike the Four Seasons and Ritz Carlton, the fact that the hotel only has 21 villas allows the staff to provide a truly personalized and genuinely accomodating experience for you. For example, there is no set restaurant. There is one extensive menu which features exceptional Balinese, Javanese and Western dishes. You can elect to take your meals ANYWHERE on the hotel grounds: by the pool, on the sand by the beach, in a classic 17th century Chinese pavilion, or in about 10 other areas. Chances are good that you will be the only ones dining in your chosen spot. Very romantic. You can even opt for a classic Balinese dinner during which you will (literally) be treated like royalty and have the staff perform traditional Balinese dances in native dress while you gorge on the seven-course meal. Wow!We encountered no problems whatsoever during our stay and staff was 110% accomodating in our every request. They do not know how to say no! They arranged excursions for us, took care of arranging for a very knowledgeable driver who basically was at our disposal for 9 hours and the total charge was only $65.00 USD!Now don't get me wrong, we did visit the Four Seasons Jimbaran for (very over-priced for Bali) cocktails and it was pretty enough with hundreds of candles on the beach and a live band performing on the sand. However, the atmosphere seemed a bit contrived and we were surrounded by dozens of other couples. The beach at Jimbaran is also quite crowded. This is fine if that is what you are looking for. However, for about a quarter of the price of any of these large luxury chains, you can have a beach populated only by a few surfers, truly personal and attentive service from a staff who treats you like family from the get-go and is truly among the best that we have encountered in out extensive travels throughout Asia (or the world, for that matter), and food that is out-of-this world! Book at Tugu Bali....you won't regret it.

We hadn't planned it this way but we ended up spending the entire time in the hotel. The service is near-flawless, the gardens and communal areas are of exceptional interest and the food is excellent. Drinks and snacks are never more than a few minutes away and every staff member was as welcoming and warm as I've ever seen at a hotel. It's pretty pricey all round but that doesn't seem so bad given the standards of the place. It's truly endearing to see the hotel staff sitting out under a canopy making flower garlands and decorations for the rooms or a Balinese dance class for local girls taking place in the gardens. It gives a sense of staying in an implausibly lovely local house.The only negatives I can think of are: the pool although very pleasant needs to be retiled and features a strange, sudden ledge; the beach is not really for swimming as the waves can be formidable; and the turn-down service arrived at inconvenient moments.

We found the hotel to be a very special place which strives to present a real Indonesian experience. I would recommend it to anyone looking for an alternative to the standard hip hotels.The hotel is beautifully decorated with Indonesian antiques which the owner has collected  built in a dark indonesian wood; it feels old-fashioned, in a nice way. The main hall is an incredible example of Balinese architecture, with a soaring ceiling and gorgeous polished wood beams, stage  floors. The dining rooms  grounds are chock full of interesting items  spaces to examine (e.g., an old apothecary, antique beauty parlor, etc)  landscaped with ponds  many flowering plants.The rooms are organized in Indonesian style 2-storey buildings. Our room was on the top floor overlooking the beach  was decorated in a colonial style, with dark wood, paned fully-opening windows, a separate small lounge with large soaking tub, 4-poster bed  antique style fixtures. It was simple, comfortable  traditional, which we liked; but do not expect a flat panel TV or noiseless a/c.We found the service to be warm, friendly  competent, with all of the staff speaking excellent english (a rarity even in well-touristed Bali). The Indonesian food is among the best  most authentic I have ever had in Bali (in my 13 trips staying at top hotels  private villas); it is overseen by a genteel matron from Java who also teaches the cooking school (a terrific experience involving traditional cooking techniques taught in the hotel's outdoor warung kitchen, which I definitely recommend). It is clear that the owners  staff strive to present the cultures  traditions of Indonesia to the guests in their choices of activities  food. The dinner experience is truly special, with guests being able to choose to dine in one of the beautifully decorated private pavilions with a choice of several traditional menus (make sure to book this in advance!). We booked a dinner for 8 in the Bale Puputan, which was magical.The only negatives I would mention are the spa services - the treatment menu is ambitious but the execution was a bit disappointing -  the pool, which is small  not particularly conducive to lounging.", "Date": "Aug 18, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR266240206", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "IPGHK"}, {"Content": "Peace and Beauty We started our 2-week Bali vacation with 4 nights at the Tugu.

The hotel property is so quiet and lovely, it was almost mystical (especially the open air lobby with 20 foot silk streamers). We found we were whispering all the time. We booked one dinner in the Black Chamber -- I don't want to ruin it for others, but suffice it to say that we were gobsmacked (in a very good way).

It was easily one of the loveliest places we stayed in Bali (the other favorite was the Komeneka in Ubud). We stayed in a Rejang Suite, and the room was beautifully decorated with exquisite attention to detail. There was an enclosed porch area where we could have our meals while watching the sunset, complete with a bathtub and private massage bed. Every day, the staff would have fresh flower and coconut palm arrangements waiting for us in our room, along with fresh fruit. The menu of activities and meal options were incredible - truly a case study in stellar marketing. My husband and I were so excited to explore all of the various amenities of the hotel.The meals themselves were also quite memorable. We had breakfast on the beach one morning (the Tugu has a small relatively private and secluded beach across a small driveway from the hotel) and another under the stars in a secluded part of the lush property. Our best meal was at Waroeng Tugu - a restaurant on the property styled after a traditional Javanese/Balinese eating hut. It was certainly the most gourmet and luxurious hut that we had ever eaten in, and a very apecial balinese experience. Those seeking an even more special experience can book a prix-fixe private meal in one of the three gorgeous pavilions on the property all decorated like miniature art galleries - the meals are pricey but likely perfect for that special occasion.The staff was excellent as well. Our room was made up practically every time we stepped out of our room, and the wait staff at the restaurant was amazing. The front desk staff was also very kind and friendly.Our stay at Canggu was wonderful - and for those considering whether to stay farther south in the more well-known tourist destinations such as Kuta or Seminyak - Canggu offers more romance and seclusion, more private beaches, and the Tugu.", "Date": "Jul 30, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR200503263", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "3", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "ssjj2007"}, {"Content": "Relaxing retreat, highly recommended We spent the first 4 days of our honeymoon at Tugu.

Tugu Bali was our last stop in Bali, having been there for an amazing two weeks. It was also the most disappointing. The design is pretty, with some lovely antiques, though far from the spectacular environment of other hotels. Tugu Bali lacked the soul of other places in Bali and felt far more commercial. (A native guide said it didn't represent the true Bali. Based on our experience, he's right.) And if you have a medical emergency, as one of us did, forget it. The desk staff refused even to look up a doctor's number on the Internet for us so we could call. That was really shocking.There are so many other hotels with more beauty and more heart.

Great hotel! We were there for the last three days of our honeymoon. We came from the Amandari and Amankila. What I loved about Tugu was the museum-quality atmosphere.

The staff was very friendly and service-oriented. There were a few things that were not quite to my liking, however. The beds, although beautiful and part of the visual charm, were uncomfortable. I agree with the last review in that not everything needs to be antique. In addition, the Indian ocean there is not really swim-able if you're not a strong swimmer. The waves are huge and powerful......though great for surfing as there were many folks doing that in the mornings. One other thing was that, although also visually charming, the lily-pad ponds create the biggest problem associated with standing water.......mosquitoes.

The owner himself is a fanatic art and antique collector, and you can surely tell by all his personal collections displayed in every corner of the hotel. Although it might not be in a bad way, but I feel that it is being overdone in few aspects. For example it certainly does not feel posh to have a sumptuous dinner eating from an obscure chipped wooden bowl. Another thing is I am very particular with regards to cleaniness, and it certainly does not feel good to arrive in a tastefully decorated room with spider webs in the bathroom corner and a yellow toe nail at the bedside.

We loved the hotel setting with antiques everywhere and the romantic dinner by the beach to watch the sunset is definitely not to be missed. The hotel is owned and operated by the Anhar family. There is an interesting story about why the owner started the hotel. Read the book Gathering Places by Barbara Walker. The book can be found on the coffee table in the lobby. We stayed at a Rejang Suite wit a view of the Indian Ocean that had a great sunk in tub. An offering made of palm leaves woven in unique design and decorated with fresh flowers along with a plate full of fresh fruits are provided to us everyday. In the evening, a different but smaller palm leaves offering with a poem printed on raw paper were placed on wooden plate on our bed wishing us sweet dreams. We had massages in the Spa as well as the bale (hut) in the garden by the beach. Listening to the waves, feeling the sea breezes and hearing children's laughters in a distance, the massage offered a very unique experience. We tried all the different style of breakfast, Javanese, Balinese, Chinese and Western. We think the local favors far exceed the Western ones. The Chinese is not true Chinese. It was a new creation since the Chinese integrated with the Balinese for centuries. The only thing we were disappointed was the limited English skills of the staff. We also suggest not to book any tour from the hotel because their staff couldn't speak English well so he only acted as a driver. There was no local tour information offered and we had to ask the reception for a tour guide. We suggest to go into town to Kuta and negotiate with a tour/activities vendor. They are all over Kuta. They offer sharing tours or private tours. Private tour usually include driver, guide, entry fees and meals. We discovered that joining a tour with a credited tour guide is definitely the way to go. It was cheaper and you learn more. We had a great tour guide who had great knowledge of the culture and could speak English very well. His name is I Ketut Astadi. He works with his team mate driver Madam Rose. They both were a great team. His mobil phone is 08123615377. We learned a lot about the Balinese culture from him.

The FS just seemed very American/ western to us, and we really enjoyed all of the Balinese and Javanese antiques at Tugu, as well as the gardens and altars. It felt more like you were staying in the home of a very wealthy, welcoming Balinese than a chain hotel. The FS view is amazing and worth a visit, but we got more of the balinese experience that we were looking for from the Tugu. We hope to visit again!", "Date": "Aug 29, 2006", "ReviewID": "UR140045271", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "tpnyc"}, {"Content": "tranquility meets class       market visit", "Date": "Aug 18, 2006", "ReviewID": "UR691297098", "Ratings": {"Service": "-1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "-1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "5", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "-1", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "azor.k"}, {"Content": "An Oasis of Tranquility and Historical Charm Well, I have been on a world trip for over 7 months now and one of the true standout hotels in our trip so far was the Hotel Tugu Bali in Seminyak, Bali. This 5 star hotel is a great balance to the Sayan -Four Seasons Hotel where we also stayed for a few days. If you are in Bali for over a week and want to save a little money and have a 5 Star experience, I would suggest 4 nights at the Hotel Tugu Bali and 3 nights at the Sayan. On a budget, but want 5 Star, the Sayan is out of the question and Tugu Bali is your best bet...and here's why:Arrived at the hotel and walked down to their intimate reception, was treated to juice and cold towels, then escorted through antique-lined rooms to cobblestone paths and subsiquently to a luxurious and spacious hotel room overlooking the ocean - on of only 22 rooms. Service was impeccable and the food was always traditional Balinese cuisiine served with a flare. Had a one-on-one Balinese cooking class with their chef while my partner enjoyed a sumptuous and truely relaxing Balinese massage. The look on his face was priceless when here returned from the massage and raved while we ate the meal that I had prepared with the chef.Right on the beach, one night, we watched the sun sink into the sea and ate a grilled seafood dinner prepared by the hotel right by our table. When I say that this is a gem of a hotel and an oasis of tranquility and historical Balinese charm, trust me, you will find it that way too...PS. We bought antiques while there and they arranged the transfer of all of my purchases the the shipping company after I left. Absolutely worth every penny at this place...Gold stars all around.", "Date": "Aug 2, 2006", "ReviewID": "UR550019214", "Ratings": {"Service": "-1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "-1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "5", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "-1", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "jteel11"}, {"Content": "You must stay here.

We loved having a banquet in the Authentic Chinese temple and another time having a big family dinner in the old family hall. The hotel was written up in Architectural Digest a few years ago.The Tugu is located right on the beach at Canggu, which is considered the number 2 or 3 surfing beach in Bali. So it is a GREAT beach if you like to surf or just ride the waves. We have teenagers so they MUCH prefer to stay here than Sanur or Nusa Dua with no waves. It is also a much better beach thatn then north east coast near Candi Dasa. BUT it is a beach for stronger swimmers and surfers. It is NOT a beach for young children.The area near the hotel is very quiet with lots of rice paddies and we have enjoyed all day bike rides in the area heading west.It is a small hotel with actual authentic Balinese cuisine and not a wide range of other options. So we mix up our meals by going out to dinner and doing a bit of shopping beforehand in Seminyak.We love it so much that we have stayed four times and it is also a favorite of several other long term Asian Expats.It can be tricky these days to be a tourist in Bali. It has gotten very developed over the past 15 years. You have to be careful in finding the hidden, spiritual, idyllic Bali of your dreams. Stay away from Nusa Dua, Seminyak, Sanur etc... Instead try The Tugu in Canggu and mix it up with a few nights in the Ubud area for a completely different side of Bali. And by the way, the beaches of your dreams are not to be found anywhere in Bali, instead in Indonesia head to the eastern Islands of Komodo etc....", "Date": "Jun 22, 2006", "ReviewID": "UR711762152", "Ratings": {"Service": "-1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "-1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "5", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "-1", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member"}, {"Content": "this is the ultimate getaway Just got back from a two weeks stay at Hotel Tugu Bali with my boyfriend.

In the following days on our trip, we asked how we should go about getting a taxi to go into town, and the staff just smiled and told us that they would be happy to take us where ever we wanted to go.

Stayed in a suite downstairs for 2 days with private pool, the biggest most comfortable beds in Bali and a outside charming bathroom. After two days switched with the suite upstairs to experience a cosy teak wood suite, high sealings and the most romantic bathtub ever.

It was as if we were guests at a very wealthy Balinese home, with the host gone and the staff at our disposal. Our room was enormous, with a shaded private plunge pool and the biggest bed we have ever seen. The setting is lovely: it's near a small fishing village about 15 minutes north of Seminyak. It's quiet and incredibly relaxing, but if you're a perfectionist, forget it: there was a little peeling paint here, a little chipped wall there, and the antiques, while amazing, make the place feel a bit eccentric. What's great is that the place feels really local; it doesn't have the blandness that comes with even the most luxurious international chains. But you sacrifice some polish too. The staff was so nice we wanted to cry: we were one of three couples there, and they babied us to no end. And there are a lot of nice, low key touches: I asked for a surfing lesson one day, and got one from a housekeeper-cum-expert-surfer who's known for catching lobster using his board and a net. He took me out for two hours-- one of the greatest things I did in Bali-- and we weren't even charged for it. The one real disappointment was the food. Despite the hotel's strenuous claims about its culinary pedigree, the food is just not up to par (for instance, I ordered gado gado for lunch; it came covered in gloppy, oily french fries-- strange for a salad dish). Our one dinner there wasn't very good, and the desserts are really weak-- we have serious sweet tooths, but we just ended up ordering plain scoops of ice cream, instead of the hotel's faux sophisticated/bizarre desserts. This is a real problem because it's a (free) 15-30 minute drive to go anywhere else. We had fun at the Tugu, and there are really some amazing things about it, from the staff to the gardens to the antiques to the peaceful setting. But if I visited Bali again, I would spend a bit more and spring for one of the endless numbers of private beach villa rentals in the area. We had come to the Tugu from the Four Seasons in Ubud-- the finest, most stunning resort we had ever stayed at-- so maybe this was an unfair comparison. It's a shame, because with better food and a few paint jobs, the Tugu would be pretty much perfect.", "Date": "Mar 1, 2005", "ReviewID": "UR573064956", "Ratings": {"Service": "-1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "-1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "4", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "-1", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member"}, {"Content": "A Very Exotic Boutique Hotel by the Beach An amazing property filled with Indonesian Antiques.
